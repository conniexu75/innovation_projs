https://openalex.org/W2017558860,"Recent identification of two receptors for the adenovirus fiber protein, coxsackie B and adenovirus type 2 and 5 receptor (CAR), and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I α-2 domain allows the molecular basis of adenoviral infection to be investigated. Earlier work has shown that human airway epithelia are resistant to infection by adenovirus. Therefore, we examined the expression and localization of CAR and MHC Class I in an in vitro model of well differentiated, ciliated human airway epithelia. We found that airway epithelia express CAR and MHC Class I. However, neither receptor was present in the apical membrane; instead, both were polarized to the basolateral membrane. These findings explain the relative resistance to adenovirus infection from the apical surface. In contrast, when the virus was applied to the basolateral surface, gene transfer was much more efficient because of an interaction of adenovirus fiber with its receptors. In addition, when the integrity of the tight junctions was transiently disrupted, apically applied adenovirus gained access to the basolateral surface and enhanced gene transfer. These data suggest that the receptors required for efficient infection are not available on the apical surface, and interventions that allow access to the basolateral space where fiber receptors are located increase gene transfer efficiency.

However, most of the knowledge on adenoviral infection has been obtained from studies done on immortalized cell lines. The first steps in adenovirus infection are thought to involve primarily two proteins in the capsid, fiber and penton base (1Greber U.F. Singh I. Helenius A.

In a human oral epidermoid carcinoma cell line (KB cells), A549 cells, and HeLa cells, this receptor is thought to be present in the range of 3,000–10,000 receptors/cell (4Persson R. Svensson U.

After binding to the fiber receptor, penton base interaction with αVβ3 and αVβ5 integrins facilitates internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis (2Greber U.F. Willetts M. Webster P.

Then viral proteins and DNA bind to the nuclear pore complex, capsid disassembly continues, and DNA enters the nucleus accompanied by DNA-associated protein 7 (1Greber U.F. Singh I. Helenius A.

These studies have concluded that a high affinity fiber receptor is required for binding and infection and that an αVβ integrin acts as a co-receptor. We and others (15Zabner J. Freimuth P. Puga A.

In an in vitromodel of human airway epithelia, we found that unlike infections of HeLa cells adenovirus infection of ciliated airway epithelia was quite limited and that which did occur was not blocked by co-incubation with soluble fiber protein (15Zabner J. Freimuth P. Puga A. Fabrega A. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In a second set of experiments, we measured fiber-mediated binding of adenovirus and found that fiber protein had no effect on binding to differentiated airway epithelia. Based on these studies, we concluded that ciliated airway epithelia lack high affinity fiber receptor activity. Two separate groups have recently cloned receptors that bind adenovirus fiber and may be involved in the pathogenesis of adenovirus infection. Bergelson et al. (23Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S. Horwitz M.S. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W.

The results from Bergelsonet al. (23Bergelson J.M. Cunningham J.A. Droguett G. Kurt-Jones E.A. Krithivas A. Hong J.S. Horwitz M.S. Crowell R.L. Finberg R.W.

Virol. 1997; 71: 412-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who found that human chromosome 21 DNA-containing CAR sequence allows Chinese hamster cells to bind fiber. Hong et al. (25Hong S.S. Karayan L. Tournier J. Curiel D.T. Boulanger P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2294-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) used a phage display hexapeptide library to identify mimotopes of the fiber protein receptor. One of these mimotopes was homologous to the core motif of the MHC-I α-2 consensus region (25Hong S.S. Karayan L. Tournier J. Curiel D.T. Boulanger P.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2294-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In a lymphoblastoid cell line they found that expression of MHC-I resulted in increased fiber protein binding and adenovirus-mediated gene transfer as compared with cells that lack expression of MHC-I. The discovery of CAR and MHC-I α-2 domain allowed us to investigate the molecular basis for our earlier finding of a lack of fiber receptor activity on the apical membrane of human airway epithelia and the limited efficiency of adenovirus infection. Airway epithelial cells were obtained from surgical polypectomies or from trachea and bronchi of lungs removed for organ donation from non-CF and CF patients as indicated. Cells were isolated by enzyme digestion as described previously (26Rich D.P. Couture L.A. Cardoza L.M. Guiggio V.M. Armentano D. Espino P.C. Hehir K. Welsh M.J. Smith A.E. Gregory R.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1993; 4: 461-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2 onto collagen-coated, 0.6-cm2 diameter millicell polycarbonate filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air. Twenty four hours after plating, the mucosal media was removed, and the cells were allowed to grow at the air-liquid interface (27Kondo M. Finkbeiner W.E. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: L106-L117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yamaya M. Finkbeiner W.E. Chun S.Y. Widdicombe J.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L713-L724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The culture media consisted of a 1:1 mix of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12, 5% Ultraser G (Biosepra SA, Cedex, France), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1% nonessential amino acids, and 0.12 units/ml insulin. Epithelia were tested for transepithelial resistance and for morphology by scanning electron microscopy. Recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing β-galactosidase, Ad2/βGal-2, and CFTR, Ad2/CFTR-16, were prepared as described previously (29Welsh M.J. Zabner J. Graham S.M. Smith A.E. Moscicki R. Wadsworth S.C. Hum. Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by the University of Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core at titers of ∼1010 infectious units/ml. Recombinant adenovirus vectors expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (30Flotte T.R. Beck S.E. Chesnut K. Potter M. Poirier A. Zolotukhin S. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 166-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Zolotukhin S. Potter M. Hauswirth W.W. Guy J. Muzyczka N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4646-4654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Ad2/GFP, and the purified fiber knob protein used for competition experiments (32Bai M. Harfe B. Freimuth P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5198-5205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were a gift of Dr. Sam Wadsworth (Genzyme, Framingham, MA). Epithelia were allowed to reach confluence and develop a transepithelial electrical resistance (Rt), indicating the development of tight junctions and an intact barrier. All epithelia had values of Rt>500 Ω·cm2. Fourteen days after seeding, 50 μl containing 50 m.o.i. of the recombinant viruses in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added to the apical surface. The particle to infectious unit ratio ranged between 24 and 34, and the cell number in a 0.6-cm diameter well differentiated airway epithelium is approximately 750,000. Following the indicated incubation time, the viral suspension was removed, and the monolayers were rinsed twice with PBS. After infection, the epithelia were incubated at 37 °C for an additional 30–72 h. Transepithelial resistance (Rt) was measured with an ohm meter (EVOM™, World Precision Instrument Inc., Sarasota, FL) before infection, and Rt was not altered by application of virus. To disrupt the tight junctions, we pretreated the apical surface of the epithelia for 30 min with 400 μl of either Eagle's modified essential media (EMEM), deionized H2O, or 8 mm EGTA in EMEM (EGTA) at 37 °C. To evaluate virus association with cells, adenovirus was covalently labeled with the carbocyanine dye, Cy3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (13Leopold P.L. Ferris B. Grinberg I. Worgall S. Hackett N.R. Crystal R.G. Hum. Gene Ther. 1998; 9: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The labeling procedure decreased the infectious units/particle ratio by 5–35%. To obtain a quantitative assessment of CAR message in human airway epithelia, we used the ribonuclease protection assay. Total RNA was isolated from primary airway epithelia using RNA-STAT 60 (Tel-Test Corp., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. [32P]UTP randomly labeled antisense RNA probes for CAR and β-actin were transcribed from linearized plasmid DNA using T3 polymerase for CAR and Sp6 polymerase for β-actin. Antisense probes were hybridized with 10 μg of total RNA from primary airway epithelia using a ribonuclease protection assay II kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA-RNA hybrids were digested with a 1/200 dilution of RNase A/T1 provided to yield a 216-nucleotide CAR-protected fragment and a 127-nucleotide β-actin-protected fragment. Protected fragments were separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. Visualization and quantitation of CAR and β-actin was achieved by exposing the membrane to a phosphoscreen and scanning with a STORM PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Quantitation of the CAR message was normalized to β-actin message and expressed as a ratio of CAR/β-actin. To evaluate CAR expression at the apical and basolateral membrane of differentiated airway epithelia, unpermeabilized ciliated airway epithelia were incubated for 3 h with 1:60 dilution of an anti-CAR monoclonal antibody (RmcB) applied either to the apical or to the basolateral side at 4 °C. After careful rinsing, the epithelia were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of FITC-labeled anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. Non-immune ascites fluid and secondary antibody alone were used as negative controls. Staining with RmcB was detected on HeLa cells and CAR cDNA-electroporated Chinese hamster cells but not on CFTR cDNA-electroporated cells (data not shown). To evaluate MHC-I α-2 domain expression at the apical and basolateral membrane of differentiated airway epithelia, we used a similar protocol with 1:100 dilution of anti-human MHC-I antibody (ICN Immunobiologicals, Costa Mesa, CA). The epithelia were mounted on slides in Gelmount (Biomedia Corp., Foster City, CA) and examined using epifluorescence with a Leica photomicroscope. We measured total β-galactosidase activity using a commercially available method (Galacto-LightTM, Tropix, Inc., Bedford, MA). Briefly, after rinsing with PBS, cells were removed from filters by incubation with 120 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris phosphate, pH 7.8, 2 mm dithiothreitol; 2 mm1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; 10% glycerol; and 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min. Light emission was quantified in a luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego). To detect GFP expression, we dissociated the epithelia with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mmEDTA. Fluorescence from 50,000 individual cells was analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell analysis (FACScan, Lysys II software, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The percentage of cells positive for GFP was assessed by determining the percent of highly fluorescent cells in each group and subtracting the fluorescence of the control cells. To assess the GFP expression of immature, basal non-ciliated epithelial cells, aliquots of the cell suspension were fixed with 1.8% formaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde for 5 min. The cells were spun at 1000 rpm and resuspended in PBS at a density of 107cells/ml. The cell suspension was incubated with 1:100 monoclonal anti-CK-14 antibody or no antibody for 2 h. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended with a 1:50 Texas Red anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. GFP and Texas Red fluorescence (CK-14) from 10,000 individual cells were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell analysis (16Zabner J. Zeiher B.G. Friedman E. Welsh M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6994-7003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess the level of CAR expression by GFP-positive cells, aliquots of the cell suspension were incubated with RmcB antibody (1:60 dilution) for 2 h. The cells were centrifuged and resuspended with a 1:200 dilution Texas Red anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h. GFP and Texas Red (CAR) fluorescence from 10,000 individual cells were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell analysis. Epithelia were mounted in modified Ussing chambers (Jim's Instruments, Iowa City, IA) as described previously (33Zabner J. Wadsworth S.C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 458-465PubMed Google Scholar). Epithelia were bathed on the submucosal surface with a Ringer's solution containing, in mm, 135 NaCl, 2.4 KH2PO4 0.6 KH2PO2 1.2 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 10 Hepes (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 dextrose. The mucosal solution was identical with the exception that NaCl was replaced with 135 mm sodium gluconate. Amiloride (10 μm) was added to the mucosal solution to inhibit Na+ channels and transepithelial Na+ transport. The cAMP agonists, 10 μmforskolin and 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine, were added to the mucosal and submucosal solutions to stimulate transepithelial Cl− current through CFTR Cl− channels. To assess total Cl− current, we then added 100 μm bumetanide to the submucosal solution and measured the change in current. Airway epithelia were treated with EMEM, H2O, or 8 mmEGTA in EMEM as described above. Immediately after treatment, 50 m.o.i. of Cy3-labeled Ad2/βGal-2 in 100 μl of PBS were added to the apical surface of epithelia at 4 °C. After 20 min the virus was removed, and epithelia were rinsed twice with PBS. Cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100 at 20 °C for 10 min and then rinsed 3 times with PBS. The cells were stained with BODIPY 650/665-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 10 min, rinsed, and then mounted on glass slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Optical sections of fluorescent samples were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 equipped with a Kr/Ar laser at × 60 magnification. Data was reconstructed in X-Z series and projected with varying thickness to display a cross-section of the epithelia. We investigated the abundance of CAR mRNA in airways by using primary cultures of human airway epithelia grown on permeable filter supports. We previously showed that 3 days after seeding, the airway epithelia showed a fiber-dependent infection by adenovirus (15Zabner J. Freimuth P. Puga A. Fabrega A. Welsh M.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 16Zabner J. Zeiher B.G. Friedman E. Welsh M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6994-7003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourteen days after seeding most of the cells in the epithelia were covered with cilia, and these epithelia were resistant to adenovirus infection. To evaluate the contribution of CAR to adenovirus infection, we studied CAR mRNA in poorly differentiated (3 days after seeding) or well differentiated (14 days after seeding) airway epithelia. Fig.1 shows that both poorly differentiated and well differentiated airway epithelia expressed similar levels of CAR mRNA. These data indicate that ciliated airway epithelia express CAR message at similar levels to HeLa cells and poorly differentiated airway epithelia. There are at least two possible explanations as follows: first, CAR is expressed in differentiated epithelia, but the protein is present only on the basolateral membrane; second, only a few cells express CAR, and vectors applied to the lumen do not have access to those cells. We first evaluated the possibility that CAR is not expressed at the apical membrane of differentiated airway epithelia by immunocytochemistry. No staining was observed when the antibody was added to the apical side (Fig.2 A). However, CAR staining was detected on the surface of most cells when the antibody was added to the basolateral side. Furthermore, a small population of cells showed very high levels of CAR staining (Fig. 2 A). When no primary or non-immune ascites fluid was used, no stain was visible (data not shown). To more quantitatively analyze CAR expression, we used fluorescence-activated cell scanning (FACS) to determine the number of cells expressing CAR and the level of CAR expression by each cell. Fig. 2 B shows examples of histograms obtained from cells stained with anti-CAR antibody. The shift in fluorescence suggests that most cells express CAR. In addition, the histogram shows that a subpopulation of the epithelial cells was highly fluorescent. These highly fluorescent cells may represent basal cells, since we found a similar number of cells were positive for cytokeratin 14 (CK-14) expression, a basal cell marker (16Zabner J. Zeiher B.G. Friedman E. Welsh M.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6994-7003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Because both anti-CAR and anti-CK-14 were mouse monoclonals, studies to evaluate co-localization of CK-14 and CAR by FACS were not possible. We also studied the cellular distribution of MHC-I α-2 domain on well differentiated human airway epithelia. Epithelia were incubated with an FITC-labeled anti-human MHC-I antibody applied either to the apical or basolateral surface. As with anti-CAR antibodies, no staining was observed when the antibody was added to the apical side (Fig.3). However, membrane staining was observed throughout the epithelium when the antibody was added to the basolateral side (Fig. 3). No staining was seen with the FITC-labeled secondary antibody alone or when mouse cells were used (data not shown). These results suggest that the adenovirus fiber receptors, CAR and MHC-I α-2 domain receptor, are polarized to the basolateral plasma membrane of the airway epithelia. In addition, they suggest that a small population of cells, probably basal cells, express higher levels of CAR. This polarity may account for the relative resistance to adenovirus infection when vector is applied to the apical membrane. Furthermore, the results predict that infection from the basolateral side should be more efficient and fiber-dependent. We investigated the ability of adenovirus to infect human airway epithelia through the basolateral side by a fiber-dependent mechanism. Since the adenovirus diameter is only 70–130 nm (3$$Google Scholar), it should be able to pass freely through the Millipore filters (0.4 μm pores) used to grow the airway epithelia. To test this hypothesis, we turned the epithelia upside down and carefully applied 50 m.o.i. of Ad2/βGal-2 in a volume of 25 μl to the bottom of the Millipore filter. After 30 min, the epithelia were rinsed thoroughly. Fig.4 shows that airway epithelia expressed β-galactosidase activity at levels 2 logs greater when the virus was applied from the basolateral side than when it was placed on the apical surface. In contrast to apical infection, infection from the basolateral surface was blocked by addition of 70 μg/ml fiber knob. To estimate the number of cells achieving gene transfer via the basolateral side, we applied Ad2/GFP to the basolateral surface for 30 min, and after 48 h we assayed GFP expression by FACS. Fig.5 A shows that 41.3 ± 4.4% of the cells were positive for GFP expression when the virus was applied via the basolateral side compared with 1.3 ± 0.2% when it was applied via the apical side. Fig. 5 B shows a fluorescence photomicrograph of epithelia infected with Ad2/GFP via the apical and basolateral sides. Many cells showed moderate GFP fluorescence, and a small population of cells had a higher intensity of fluorescence (arrows). We hypothesized that depending on the level of CAR expression, some cells will be more prone to infection. To evaluate this possibility further, we analyzed cells by FACS. Fig.6 A shows two different populations of GFP-positive cells, one with moderate levels of fluorescence and one with very high levels of fluorescence. To characterize further the population of cells expressing high and moderate levels of GFP, we used an anti-CAR antibody or an anti-CK14 antibody to assess for expression of CAR and CK-14 (a basal cell marker). Many of the cells with the highest GFP fluorescence also showed high levels of anti-CAR fluorescence (top right quadrant in Fig. 6 B) and high levels of anti-CK-14 fluorescence (top right quadrant in Fig. 6 C). The data suggest that a subpopulation of cells, probably basal cells, may express higher levels of CAR and therefore are more prone to adenovirus infection. However, some cells highly positive for GFP expressed low levels of CK14 and CAR suggesting that other receptors (perhaps MHC-1) may also be involved in adenovirus binding and infection. Moreover, most of the cells expressing moderate levels of GFP expressed low levels of CAR (bottom left quadrant in Fig. 6 B) suggesting that low levels of CAR may limit the degree of adenovirus infection.Figure 6Effect of polarity of infection on adenovirus-mediated GFP expression by human airway cells. Well differentiated airway epithelia were exposed to 50 m.o.i. Ad2/GFP for 30 min from the basolateral side.

Thus, basal cells cannot contribute to Cl− transport across the apical membrane. Therefore we asked if delivery of adenovirus expressing CFTR via the basolateral side would correct the Cl− transport defect in well differentiated CF epithelia. Finally, whereas the relationship between β-galactosidase expression on measured β-galactosidase activity is linear, the relationship between expression of CFTR and transepithelial Cl− transport is not (33Zabner J. Wadsworth S.C. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 458-465PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows that 48 h after 50 m.o.i. of Ad2/CFTR-16 were added to the basolateral side of CF epithelia for 30 min, total Cl− current (ΔIscBum) increased into the range observed in normal epithelia (34Zabner J.

No correction was observed when the virus was added to the apical side. We cannot exclude the possibility that cell division and differentiation of basal cells resulted in adenovirus-mediated expression of CFTR in columnar cells; however, the low rate of cell division (35Mc"

One is similar to Phanerochaete chrysosporiummanganese-dependent peroxidase. The second protein (PS1), although catalyzing the oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+ by H2O2, differs from the above enzymes by its manganese-independent activity enabling it to oxidize substituted phenols and synthetic dyes, as well as the lignin peroxidase (LiP) substrate veratryl alcohol. This is by a mechanism similar to that reported for LiP, as evidenced byp-dimethoxybenzene oxidation yielding benzoquinone. The apparent kinetic constants showed high activity on Mn2+, but methoxyhydroquinone was the natural substrate with the highest enzyme affinity (this and other phenolic substrates are not efficiently oxidized by the P. chrysosporium peroxidases). A three-dimensional model was built using crystal models from four fungal peroxidase as templates. The model suggests high structural affinity of this versatile peroxidase with LiP but shows a putative Mn2+ binding site near the internal heme propionate, involving Glu36, Glu40, and Asp181. A specific substrate interaction site for Mn2+ is supported by kinetic data showing noncompetitive inhibition with other peroxidase substrates. Moreover, residues reported as involved in LiP interaction with veratryl alcohol and other aromatic substrates are present in peroxidase PS1 such as His82 at the heme-channel opening, which is remarkably similar to that of P. chrysosporiumLiP, and Trp170 at the protein surface. These residues could be involved in two different hypothetical long range electron transfer pathways from substrate (His82-Ala83-Asn84-His47-heme and Trp170-Leu171-heme) similar to those postulated for LiP.

Plochmann R. Löffler H. Holz als Rohstoff in der Weltwirtschaft. Landwirtschaftsverlag, Münster, Germany1979: 14-44Google Scholar). Although the main wood constituent, cellulose, can be utilized by a variety of organisms, its hydrolysisin situ by most of them is hampered by the recalcitrant lignin polymer, which is formed by polymerization of plantp-hydroxycinnamyl alcohols (2Higuchi T. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Wood. Springer Verlag, London1997Crossref Google Scholar). However, the so-called white rot fungi, a group of species from class Basidiomycetes, have developed a remarkable capability for oxidative depolymerization and subsequent mineralization of lignin (3Kirk T.K. Farrell R.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 465-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar) enabling cellulose utilization by other organisms. During recent years many studies on lignin biodegradation have been carried out in the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium (order Stereales). The first evidence of peroxidase involvement came from inhibition of lignin degradation by catalase (4Faison B.D. Kirk T.K. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1983; 46: 1140-1145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then two peroxidases involved in lignin degradation, the so-called lignin peroxidase (LiP)1 and manganese peroxidase or manganese-dependent peroxidase (MnP), were described (5Tien M. Kirk T.K. Science. 1983; 221: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 6Glenn J.K. Morgan M.A. Mayfield M.B. Kuwahara M. Gold M.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

LiP is characterized by high redox potential enabling oxidation of hardly biodegradable nonphenolic aromatic compounds, such as veratryl alcohol and methoxylated benzenes. P. chrysosporium MnP strictly requires Mn2+ to complete the catalytic cycle, and the chelates of Mn3+ formed can act as efficient oxidizers of phenols and other compounds. Because most units in lignin are nonphenolic (2Higuchi T. Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of Wood. Springer Verlag, London1997Crossref Google Scholar), LiP was considered as the main enzyme responsible for lignin depolymerization (3Kirk T.K. Farrell R.L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1987; 41: 465-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). This is still generally accepted, although some evidence suggests that lignin biodegradation could proceed by endwise attack at the phenolic units (8Martı́nez-Iñigo M.J. Kurek B. Holzforschung. 1997; 51: 543-548Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and that, in addition to Mn3+ chelates, strong chemical oxidants can be generated by MnP (9Bao W.L. Fukushima Y. Jensen K.A. Moen M.A. Hammel K.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Since 1983–1984 a large amount of information on peroxidases fromP. chrysosporium has been accumulated (10Schoemaker H.E. Lundell T.K. Hatakka A.I. Piontek K. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 321-332Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Gold M.H. Alic M. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 605-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shimada M. Higuchi T. Hon D.N.S. Shiraishi N.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the time of the LiP model, only the cytochrome c peroxidase crystal structure was available. The information on their molecular structure not only clarified some peculiarities of these enzymes but also contributed to better understanding of some aspects of peroxidase structure and function (17Banci L. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 53: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Despite the above progresses, the mechanism by which lignin is biodegraded is still to be fully understood, and only a limited number of biotechnological applications have been developed. This is related to the fact that the above studies have been focused on a single organism and that little is known about lignin degradation by fungi in their natural environment. Studies on lignocellulose degradation under solid state fermentation (SSF) conditions, which are close to those of natural habitat of white rot fungi, should provide information to contrast that obtained using liquid media (18Camarero S. Böckle B. Martı́nez M.J. Martı́nez A.T. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 1070-1072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vares T. Kalsi M. Hatakka A. Appl. Environ.

The fungus Pleurotus eryngii (order Poriales) has been reported as having the capability to remove lignin selectively when growing on natural substrates and is therefore considered a model organism for studies on biodegradation of lignin in annual plants and related biotechnological applications (21Martı́nez A.T. Camarero S. Guillén F. Gutiérrez A. Muñoz C. Varela E. Martı́nez M.J. Barrasa J.M. Ruel K. Pelayo M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 265-274Crossref Google Scholar, 22Camarero S. Barrasa J.M. Pelayo M. Martı́nez A.T. J. Pulp Paper Sci. 1998; 24: 197-203Google Scholar). Peroxidases oxidizing Mn2+ have been reported in liquid cultures of P. eryngii (23Martı́nez M.J. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Guillén F. Martı́nez A.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), together with the AAO responsible for H2O2 generation in Pleurotus species and laccases (21Martı́nez A.T. Camarero S. Guillén F. Gutiérrez A. Muñoz C. Varela E. Martı́nez M.J. Barrasa J.M. Ruel K. Pelayo M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 13: 265-274Crossref Google Scholar, 24Muñoz C. Guillén F. Martı́nez A.T. Martı́nez M.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 2166-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no typical LiP has been described in this or other Pleurotus species. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize the peroxidases involved in natural degradation of lignin by this fungus and to investigate the eventual production of LiP. P. eryngii was therefore grown on a lignocellulosic substrate under SSF conditions, and several peroxidases were isolated. Their catalytic properties were investigated using different substrates, and a three-dimensional model for aP. eryngii peroxidase was built using existing crystal models from other fungal peroxidases as templates. P. eryngii ATCC 90787 (IJFM A169), Trametes versicolor IJFM A136, andP. chrysosporium ATCC 24725 (VKM F-1767) were grown on sterile wheat straw under SSF conditions. These are characterized by the presence of enough liquid phase to saturate the solid lignocellulosic substrate, maintaining an air phase between particles. The fungi were grown in an horizontal rotary fermentor, which included six 2-liter bottles containing 125 g of straw (length, 1–2 cm) and 375 ml of water (including inoculum). The inoculation and growth conditions were already described (22Camarero S. Barrasa J.M. Pelayo M. Martı́nez A.T. J. Pulp Paper Sci. 1998; 24: 197-203Google Scholar). Samples were taken during 2 months to analyze enzymatic activities and substrate degradation. Lignin content was estimated by the Klason method after Saeman's acid hydrolysis and polysaccharide composition by gas chromatography of the acid hydrolyzate, following T-222 and T249 rules (25Tappi Test Methods 1992–1993. TAPPI, Atlanta, GA1993Google Scholar). Reactive Black 5 (C26H21N5O19S6Na4) was obtained from DyStar (Frankfurt, Germany), 2,2′-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) (ABTS) was from Boehringer, and other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich. LiP activity was assayed by oxidation of 2 mm veratryl alcohol to veratraldehyde (ε310 9.3 mm−1cm−1) in 0.1 m tartrate buffer, pH 3, with 0.4 mm H2O2 (controls without H2O2 were included). Mn2+-oxidizing peroxidase was estimated by formation of Mn3+ tartrate (ε238 6.5 mm−1cm−1) from 0.1 mm MnSO4 in 0.1m sodium tartrate, pH 5, with 0.1 mmH2O2. Peroxidase activity on phenols was quantified using 2.5 mm syringol (2,6-dimethoxyphenol) (ε469 27.5 mm−1cm−1 referred to substrate), in 0.1 msodium tartrate, pH 3, with 0.1 mmH2O2 (23Martı́nez M.J. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Guillén F. Martı́nez A.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). AAO was determined as the veratraldehyde formed from 5 mm veratryl alcohol in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 6. Laccase was measured with 10 mm syringol in 0.1 m sodium tartrate, pH 5. One activity unit was defined as the amount of enzyme transforming 1 μmol of substrate/min. Peroxidases were purified from 15-day-old SSF cultures. Water extracts from the straw treated with the fungus were obtained (by adding 3 liters/bottle and shaking for 1 h at 200 rpm), filtered (0.8 μm), concentrated by ultrafiltration (5-kDa cut-off), and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium tartrate, pH 4.5. The concentrate (approximately 140 ml) was loaded onto a Bio-Rad Q-cartridge (1 ml/min), and retained fractions were eluted with 1 m NaCl. Fractions with peroxidase activity were concentrated, and 1-ml samples applied onto a Sephacryl S-200 HR column (0.8 ml/min). The peroxidase fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed against 10 mm sodium tartrate, pH 5, and 1-ml samples were applied to a Mono-Q column. Proteins with peroxidases activity were separated using a 0–0.25 mNaCl gradient (30 min, 0.8 ml/min). Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford reagent. Isoelectric focusing was performed in 5% polyacrylamide gels with a thickness of 1 mm and a pH range from 2.5 to 5.5. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out in 12% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Proteins were deglycosylated using Endo-H from Boehringer. The N-terminal sequences were obtained by automated Edman degradation of 5 μg of protein in an Applied Biosystems 494 pulsed liquid protein sequencer. The steady state kinetic constants were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plots, and the mean values are presented. The kinetic constants for Mn2+ peroxidase activity were calculated by the formation of Mn3+ tartrate at pH 5. Manganese-independent activities at pH 3 on ABTS (cation radical ε436 29.3 mm−1cm−1), Reactive Black 5 (ε558 50 mm−1 cm−1), guaiacol (o-methoxyphenol) (oxidation product ε456 12.1 mm−1 cm−1 referred to substrate concentration), syringol, methoxyhydroquinone (methoxybenzoquinone ε360 1.25 mm−1cm−1), veratryl alcohol, and p-dimethoxybenzene (benzoquinone ε254 21 mm−1cm−1) were estimated in the presence of EDTA, and kinetic constants were calculated. The K m for the enzyme-oxidizing substrate H2O2 was also obtained at pH 5 (by measuring Mn2+ oxidation) and pH 3 (syringol oxidation). Reciprocal inhibition between Mn2+and Reactive Black 5 was investigated by following spectrophotometrically the effect of different concentrations of both compounds as inhibitors on the decolorization by peroxidase PS1 of 0.8–25 μm Reactive Black 5 (high concentration caused substrate inhibition) in 0.1 m sodium tartrate, pH 4, and the oxidation of 10–400 μm Mn2+ in 0.1m sodium tartrate, pH 5 (all reactions contained 0.1 mm H2O2). The oxidation of p-dimethoxybenzene (1 mm) was followed spectrophotometrically, using 0.1 m sodium tartrate, pH 3, and 0.2 mm H2O2. Samples (20 μl) from the reaction mixture were analyzed by HPLC using a C18 column (Spherisorb S5ODS2) at 30 °C. A methanol/phosphoric acid (10 mm) gradient (consisting of 10% methanol for 10 min, 10–100% methanol in 6 min, 100% methanol for 4 min, 100–10% methanol in 0.5 min, and 10% methanol for 6.5 min) was used (1 ml/min). Dual wavelength and diode array detectors were used. Standard calibration curves were used for quantitation. The atomic coordinates of crystal models of LiP-H8 (PDB entries 1LGA and 1LLP), LiP-H2 (1QPA), and MnP1 (1MNP) from P. chrysosporium and ARP-CIP (1ARP) were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Base. The latter peroxidase has been crystallized from both Coprinus cinereus (CIP) (26Petersen J.F.W. Kadziola A. Larsen S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) andArthromyces ramosus (ARP) (27Kunishima N. Fukuyama K. Matsubara H. Hatanaka H. Shibano Y. Amachi T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because the latter is an invalid species (nomen nudum), which could correspond to aCoprinus conidial state, and both proteins share 99% identity, the name ARP-CIP is used here for both of them. The gene coding for protein PS1 of P. eryngii has been cloned, and a preliminary sequence has been obtained (28Martı́nez A.T. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Sarkar S. Martı́nez M.J. Resùmenes XVI Congreso de la Sociedad Española de Microbiología. Ultramar, Barcelona, Spain1997: 89Google Scholar). From the predicted amino acid sequence a three-dimensional model for the mature protein without Mn2+ was obtained by sequence homology using the program ProMod and refined by CHARMm (the C-terminal region was not modeled) (29Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). It was based on alignment of sequence of peroxidase PS1 with the above four fungal peroxidases for which crystal models are available. Secondary structure was determined with the DSSP program (30Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12333) Google Scholar). The above models for P. chrysosporium MnP and LiP were also used for comparison with P. eryngii peroxidase PS1 using programs Swiss-Pdb Viewer and RasMol. Multiple sequence alignment was prepared with PILEUP from GCG package using W2H interface. P. eryngii degrades wheat lignin maintaining high cellulose content. This resulted in the increased polysaccharide/lignin ratio shown in Table I. Preferential degradation of lignin is a singular characteristic because most ligninolytic basidiomycetes (including the P. chrysosporiumand T. versicolor strains shown in Table I) cause stronger degradation of cellulose than lignin. When the presence of ligninolytic enzymes was investigated in the partially degraded straw no LiP was detected in any case, but AAO, laccase, and Mn2+-oxidizing peroxidase were all produced by P. eryngii and T. versicolor. The high Mn2+-oxidizing activity produced by P. eryngiisuggested that the enzyme responsible for this activity could be involved in lignin degradation.Table IExtracellular enzymatic activities and fungal modification of lignocellulose compositionMnPAAOLaccasePolysaccharide/lignin ratioaAt the end of incubation period.P. eryngii3004664.4P. chrysosporium70002.2T. versicolor200122.5Control wheat straw0002.6No peroxidase activity on veratryl alcohol (LiP) was detected, and maximal laccase, AAO, and Mn2+-oxidizing peroxidase (MnP) activities are shown as units/100 g initial straw.a At the end of incubation period. Open table in a new tab No peroxidase activity on veratryl alcohol (LiP) was detected, and maximal laccase, AAO, and Mn2+-oxidizing peroxidase (MnP) activities are shown as units/100 g initial straw. The process of peroxidase purification included ultrafiltration of the extract from SSF culture of P. eryngii, followed by Q-cartridge (removing colored compounds from lignin degradation), molecular size exclusion, and ion exchange chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the last purification step resulted in the isolation of two major protein peaks (labeled PS1 and PS3) and a minor one (protein PS2). Both major peaks were electrophoretically homogeneous (Fig. 1 B) and were fully characterized. The three proteins exhibited high absorbance at 410 nm and were able to oxidize Mn2+ in the presence of H2O2. The optimum for this reaction was at pH 5. Proteins PS1, PS2, and PS3 differed in Mono-Q retention volume,A 410/A 280 ratio (4.9, 4.9, and 5.5), isoelectric point (3.67, 3.65, and 3.80, respectively), molecular mass (45, 45, and 42 kDa, respectively), and N termini (VTCATGQTT for PS1 and PS2 and VTCADGNTV for PS3). In the case of protein PS1 a total of 25 amino acid residues were identified, and no double sequences were observed confirming protein purity. Proteins PS1 and PS3 also differed in the N-glycosylation degree (4 and 2%, respectively). A different Mn2+-oxidizing peroxidase produced by P. eryngii when grown in liquid media (23Martı́nez M.J. Ruiz-Dueñas F.J. Guillén F. Martı́nez A.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 424-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) has a molecular mass intermediate between those of the two major peroxidases isolated here (Fig. 1 B) and also differs in the N-terminal sequence. In addition to their activity on Mn2+, the peroxidases isolated from lignocellulose cultures were able to oxidize substituted phenols, such as guaiacol, syringol, and methoxyhydroquinone. The proteins PS1 and PS2 were able to also oxidize nonphenolic aromatic molecules such as the LiP substrate veratryl alcohol. The fact that peroxidase activity on veratryl alcohol (LiP-type activity) was not detected in the cultures (Table I) is probably due to its inhibition by phenols (or other aromatic compounds in extracts) as described for LiP (19;31). Because veratryl alcohol is a substrate ofPleurotus AAO (and can be oxidized by other fungal enzymes in the presence of mediators), p-dimethoxybenzene was assayed as a more specific LiP substrate. The results of incubation with peroxidases PS1 and PS3, only the first enzyme oxidizing the substrate, are shown in Fig. 2(A and B). The HPLC analysis revealed benzoquinone as the reaction product by peroxidase PS1 (Fig.2 C). The higher redox potential of peroxidase PS1 was evidenced also by oxidation of some synthetic dyes. Whereas both enzymes oxidized ABTS (PS1 with 3-fold higher specific activity than PS3), only peroxidase PS1 was able to decolorize the Reactive Black 5, a high redox potential azo dye. The optimum for all the manganese-independent reactions was around pH 3. The steady state kinetic constants of the two major peroxidases for oxidation of Mn2+ to Mn3+ and for manganese-independent oxidation of two phenolic and two nonphenolic aromatic substrates, and the dye Reactive Black 5 are shown in TableII. As already mentioned, the three latter substrates were oxidized only by peroxidase PS1, but both peroxidases also differed in the K m values for the other substrates. These revealed higher affinities for Mn2+and phenols of PS1 than PS3. Moreover, peroxidase PS1 could oxidize methoxyhydroquinone concentrations below 1 μm, whereas peroxidase PS3 did not exhibit activity below 100 μmsubstrate. The K m obtained for peroxidase PS1 (17 μm) is lower than found for other enzyme-reducing aromatic substrates (with the only exception of synthetic dyes), revealing substituted hydroquinones as the best natural substrates ofP. eryngii peroxidase PS1 from the point of view of enzyme affinity. However, because of the higher turnover number for Mn2+ oxidation, both peroxidases showed the highest efficiency (t/K m) for Mn2+ oxidation (even considering that oxidation of aromatic compounds should involve two one-electron oxidations). The apparent K m values for H2O2, obtained during both Mn2+oxidation at pH 5 and oxidation of aromatic substrates at pH 3, were low. This corresponds to high affinity of peroxidases for H2O2, but the value obtained at pH 3 could be considered as extremely low compared with other fungal peroxidases. Mutual inhibition between peroxidase PS1 oxidation of the substrates Reactive Black 5 (an azo dye that is not oxidized by Mn3+) and Mn2+ was found. However, the azo dye appeared as a stronger inhibitor because the inhibitor/substrate molar ratio, to cause 40% inhibition, was 125 in the case of Mn2+inhibition of dye oxidation, and only 0.13 in the case of Reactive Black 5 inhibition of Mn2+ oxidation. The type of inhibition caused by Reactive Black 5 was investigated using different dye concentrations, and although a decrease of the velocity of Mn2+ oxidation was found (the turnover number decreasing from 71 to 43 s−1 in the presence of 32 μmdye), the K m value was maintained (around 50 μm). This suggests two different substrate interaction sites with different affinities that are not affected by the presence of the alternative substrate acting as inhibitor. The inhibitory effect would be caused by the reduction of the oxidized enzyme forms (compounds I and II) during oxidation of the substrate acting as inhibitor. Finally, it is possible to mention that the stronger inhibitory effect caused by Reactive Black 5 agrees with the higher peroxidase affinity for this substrate, compared with the affinity for Mn2+.Table IISteady state kinetic constants of the two fungal peroxidases (PS1 and PS3) purified from straw partially delignified by P. eryngii (mean values)K mtPS1PS3PS1PS3μmS−1Mn2+ oxidationapH 5.Mn2+482007978H2O2910Manganese-independent reactionsbpH 3.Methoxyhydroquinone17 (890)cA two-step activity curve was obtained when high substrate concentrations are used resulting in a second apparentK m, the enzyme being more efficient at the lowest one.25304 (19Vares T.

Open table in a new tab Because the above results showed that peroxidase PS1 shared LiP and MnP-type catalytic properties, as well as some characteristics of other peroxidases oxidizing phenolic substrates, a three-dimensional model was built for the mature protein (this model includes the two helical domains characteristic of all peroxidases). The four fungal peroxidases for which crystal structures are available were used as templates for homology modeling, and a multiple alignment of their corresponding sequences together with the PS1 sequence that was modeled is shown in Fig. 3. These peroxidases are P. chrysosporium MnP1 (58% sequence identity with PS1) and isoenzymes H8 (60%) and H2 (62%) of LiP, and CoprinusARP-CIP (52%). The model obtained showed good geometry with root mean square deviations in bond angles and distances of 2.31 ° and 0.013 Å, respectively. It includes 12 predominantly α helices, the position and size of which is indicated in Fig. 3. The helix B“corresponds to helix B′ of LiP (14Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol.

A short helix at the position of helix B′ of P. eryngii peroxidase PS1 was described in ARP-CIP (27Kunishima N. Fukuyama K. Matsubara H. Hatanaka H. Shibano Y. Amachi T. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and some helical conformation at this position can be observed also in LiP. Therefore, the three latter peroxidases could include 12 helices, compared with only 11 helices of P. chrysosporium MnP1. The peroxidase PS1 conserves some structurally important elements including disulphide bridges (the last one is not included in the model because it links the C-terminal region to helix I) and putative Ca2+ sites (distal Ca2+ linked by oxygens of Asp48, Gly66, Asp68, and Ser70; and proximal one by those of Thr176, Asp193, Thr195, Thr198, and Asp200), characteristic of all peroxidases in classes II and III (17Banci L. J. Biotechnol. 1997; 53: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The peroxidase PS1 model shows the highest coincidence in protein folding and helical topology and the lowest root mean square distance between backbone Cα with the LiP-H8 and ARP-CIP models. However, when superimposed with P. chrysosporiumMnP1 differences were found in two superficial loops (PS1 Thr57-Ala59 and MnP1 Leu228-Thr234). Some aspects of the model directly related to catalytic activity were considered more in depth. The amino acid residues at the heme pocket ofP. eryngii peroxidase PS1 were the same found in other fungal peroxidases (with the only exception of ARP-CIP): Arg43, Phe46, His47, Glu78, and Asn84 in the distal side and His175, Phe192 (Leu201 in ARP-CIP), and Asp237 in the proximal side. Fig.4 (left side) shows the opening of the main heme access channel in P. eryngiiperoxidase PS1 (top), P. chrysosporium LiP-H8 (center), and MnP1 (bottom). This channel enables the access of hydroperoxides to the distal side of heme. Moreover, it has been postulated that some of the edge residues are involved in oxidation of aromatic substrates by LiP and horseradish peroxidase. As shown in Fig. 4, the P. eryngii peroxidase PS1 conserves six of the eight residues delimiting the channel edge in LiP-H8 (and one of the two differences is the substitution of Ile85 by Leu85). However, the heme channel of P. chrysosporium MnP1 differs from that of LiP-H8 in five residues. Fig. 4 (right side) also shows the narrow Mn2+channel of P. eryngii peroxidase PS1"

The binding of xanthophylls to LHCII has been investigated, particularly with respect to the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids violaxanthin and zeaxanthin. It was found that most of the violaxanthin pool was loosely bound to the major complex and could be removed by mild detergent treatment. Gentle solubilization of photosystem II particles and thylakoids allowed the isolation of complexes, including a newly described oligomeric preparation, enriched in trimers, that retained all of the in vivo violaxanthin pool. It was estimated that each LHCII monomer can bind at least one violaxanthin. The extent to which different pigments can be removed from LHCII indicated that the relative strength of binding was chlorophyll b > neoxanthin > chlorophyll a > lutein > zeaxanthin > violaxanthin. The xanthophyll binding sites are of two types: internal sites binding lutein and peripheral sites binding neoxanthin and violaxanthin. In CP29, a minor LHCII, both a lutein site and the neoxanthin site can be occupied by violaxanthin. Upon activation of the violaxanthin de-epoxidase, the highest de-epoxidation state was found for the main LHCII component and the lowest for CP29, suggesting that only violaxanthin loosely bound to LHCII is available for de-epoxidation.

Bassi R. Ort D.R. Yocum F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1996: 539-563Google Scholar). In most plants, there are three major xanthophylls, namely lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin, the last of which can be reversibly de-epoxidized to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin via the xanthophyll cycle (2Yamamoto H.Y. Nakayama T.O.M. Chichester C.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 168-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The reason for this diversity in xanthophyll composition is not entirely clear, although the conservation of xanthophyll composition across a range of plant species (3Thayer S.S. Bjorkman O. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 23: 331-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 4Johnson G.N. Scholes J.D. Horton P. Young A.J.

Although xanthophylls are bound to both LHCII1 and LHCI, the nature of the binding has not been determined, and there are significant differences in the values reported for the numbers of pigments bound to particular complexes (6Peter G.F. Thornber P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J.

Res. 1995; 43: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the structural model for the major LHCII component, LHCIIb, there are two carotenoid molecules that are presumed to be the two luteins that have been shown to be bound by this complex (12Kuhlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 130-135Crossref Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). No other carotenoids were detected in this crystallographic study, despite the fact that there are either one or two other carotenoids present. For the other LHCII components, CP29, CP26, and CP24, there is even less certainty, with estimates of the number of bound carotenoids differing significantly (see reviews in Refs. 9Sandonà D. Croce R. Pagano A. Crimi M. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and 11Phillip D. Young A.J. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 43: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids, establishing the stoichiometry of binding is of particular importance because this cycle plays a major role in controlling the efficiency of light harvesting (5Demmig-Adams B. Adams III, W.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 599-626Crossref Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 13Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 14Gilmore A.M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 99: 197-209Crossref Google Scholar): in light-limiting conditions, maximum efficiency of light harvesting is associated with the presence of violaxanthin, whereas de-epoxidation to zeaxanthin is correlated with down-regulation of light harvesting efficiency because of the nonradiative dissipation of excess energy. This latter process is important in the protection of the photosynthetic system from photodamage and is readily detected as the nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence. For LHCIIb, the reported values for xanthophyll cycle carotenoid binding range form trace amounts (7Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) up to 1 per trimer (6Peter G.F. Thornber P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For CP29 and CP26, there are reports of between 0.65 (7Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 9Sandonà D. Croce R. Pagano A. Crimi M. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and 1.5 (6Peter G.F. Thornber P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16745-16754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) xanthophyll cycle carotenoids bound. This range of values gives rise to very different conclusions about the location of the xanthophyll cycle and its mode of action. With only trace amounts of xanthophyll cycle in LHCIIb, attention is focused on the minor complexes as the site of nonphotochemical quenching. The lowest estimates of the content of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids bound to these complexes lead to the suggestion that one of the internal luteins in the LHCIIb model is replaced by a violaxanthin (9Sandonà D. Croce R. Pagano A. Crimi M. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This internal location is consistent with a view that zeaxanthin, formed by de-epoxidation of this violaxanthin, directly quenches Chl excited states via Chl-car energy transfer (15Owens T.G. Shreve A.P. Albrecht A.C. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. 4. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1992: 179-186Google Scholar, 16Frank H.A. Cua A. Chynwat V. Young A.J. Gosztola D. Wasielewski M.R. Photosynth. Res. 1994; 41: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Conversely, if one violaxanthin is bound per LHCIIb trimer, then at least 50% of the violaxanthin pool is associated with the main population of LHCII, bound at a site other than the lutein sites (8Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Similarly, higher stoichiometries of binding to the minor complexes indicate that at least a proportion of the violaxanthin pool is not bound to the internal “lutein sites.” Such data are consistent with a peripheral location of violaxanthin and with the hypothesis that the xanthophylls cycle controls the structure of the LHCII system (13Horton P. Ruban A.V. Walters R.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 655-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar, 17Ruban A.V. Phillip D. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7855-7859Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 18Ruban A.V. Phillip D. Young A.J. Horton P. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 829-834Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Central to these arguments is also the question of which violaxanthin molecules can be de-epoxidized to zeaxanthin. In fact, the maximum de-epoxidation state of CP29 is rather low compared with LHCIIb (8Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), suggesting that peripheral violaxanthin is the preferred substrate for the violaxanthin de-epoxidase. A further question is whether violaxanthin and zeaxanthin are bound with equal strengths to LHCII; it has been suggested that only zeaxanthin (and antheraxanthin) can be associated with the complexes so as to initiate nonphotochemical quenching (14Gilmore A.M. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 99: 197-209Crossref Google Scholar). In order to understand the way in which the xanthophyll cycle carotenoids, and the other xanthophylls, control the structure and function of LHCII, it is necessary to determine where and in what numbers these carotenoids are associated within the LHCII system. In this paper, we describe a systematic study of the binding stoichiometries of pigments to both the minor and major LHCII components and determine the relative binding strengths. Thylakoids and photosystem II BBY particles were prepared from spinach leaves as described previously (8Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Light harvesting complexes of photosystem II were prepared from spinach by isoelectric focusing of either BBY particles or unstacked isolated thylakoids. The thylakoids were suspended in 0.33 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, and solubilized in 20 mmn-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM). To induce de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll cycle, spinach leaves were illuminated prior to isolation of BBY particles as described previously (8Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Alternatively, in order to achieve the maximum de-epoxidation state, unstacked thylakoids were incubated in 0.33 m sorbitol, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm HEPES, 20 mm MES, 40 mm ascorbate at pH 5.5 at 20 °C for 30 min (19Färber A. Young A.J. Ruban A.V. Horton P. Jahns P. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1609-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). After incubation, thylakoids were diluted, centrifuged, and resuspended ready for solubilization and IEF, which was performed as described previously (8Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Pascal A.A. Horton P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Further purification of LHCII was carried out by sucrose density gradient centrifugation: sucrose gradients were seven step exponential gradients from 0.15 to 1.0 m sucrose dissolved in 20 mm HEPES buffer containing 20 μm DM. The run time was 18 h at 200,000 × g in a SW41 rotor at 4 °C. To remove pigments from LHCII, samples were incubated in different concentrations of detergent prior to centrifugation. Fractionation of thylakoids involved treatment of unstacked thylakoids with 10 mm DM with a ratio of DM/Chl of 8 on ice for 45 min, followed by centrifugation through a sucrose gradient. For fractionation of BBY particles the same procedure was used except that DM concentration was 8 mm (DM/Chl = 3). The pigment composition of thylakoids, BBY particles, thylakoid subfractions, and LHCII samples was determined by reverse phase HPLC (4Johnson G.N. Scholes J.D. Horton P. Young A.J. Plant Cell Environ. 1993; 16: 681-686Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to determine the polypeptide composition of thylakoid membrane fractions. Absorption spectra were recorded using an Aminco DW2000 spectrophotometer, and fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K were measured as described previously (20Ruban A.V. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1102: 30-38Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 21Ruban A.V. Young A.J. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TableI presents the carotenoid content of LHCIIb, CP29, and CP26 isolated by IEF of PSII membranes. Based on the known number of Chl b molecules bound to each complex (9Sandonà D. Croce R. Pagano A. Crimi M. Bassi R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and the measured Chl a/b ratios, it was possible to determine the number of carotenoids bound. For LHCIIb, it was estimated that there were 2 molecules of lutein, 1 of neoxanthin, and a substoichiometric amount of violaxanthin (0.2 per monomer). CP26 bound over 1 molecule of lutein and 1 molecule each of neoxanthin and violaxanthin, whereas CP29 bound approximately 1 molecule of lutein, just over 1 of violaxanthin, and 0.6 of neoxanthin. Using these values, and assuming that a PSII unit in the thylakoid membrane contains 1 molecule each of CP29, CP26, and CP24 and 5 trimers of LHCIIb, an estimate of the carotenoid composition of PSII can be made. These data predict that there is a maximum of 8 molecules of violaxanthin bound to PSII and that violaxanthin accounts for up to 10% of the total carotenoid pool. However, assay of the carotenoid content of the BBY PSII membranes used for the isolation of the complexes indicates that the content of violaxanthin was almost 20% of total carotenoid, a value consistent with measurements made for whole thylakoids. Thus, at least half of the xanthophyll cycle pool associated with PSII cannot be accounted for by the amounts bound to the purified complexes.Table IPigment composition of LHCII, thylakoid membranes, and photosystem II BBY particlesSample%/MRLutNeoVioAntβ-CarXCCar/ChlChl a/bChl aChl bLHCIIb%62.3 ± 0.732.2 ± 1.05.9 ± 0.3005.9 ± 0.3MR1.91.00.2000.20.251.326.65.0CP26%39.2 ± 3.927.0 ± 3.131.0 ± 0.80031.0 ± 0.8MR1.21.00.9000.90.272.507.53.0CP29%32.8 ± 2.120.8 ± 3.045.2 ± 1.60045.2 ± 1.6MR0.90.61.2001.20.293.406.82.0PSII (est)MR3417<7010<70.212.1018085%5025<10015<10BBY%46.7 ± 1.821.1 ± 1.317.9 ± 1.81.7 ± 0.412.6 ± 2.719.6 ± 2.20.25 ± 0.022.05 ± 0.1MR (estimated)361715010Thylakoid%37.4 ± 2.614.7 ± 0.822.4 ± 1.41.2 ± 0.624.3 ± 1.922.4 ± 1.40.31 ± 0.013.60 ± 0.2A-band%49.7 ± 0.919.5 ± 2.124.1 ± 1.11.6 ± 1.15.1 ± 1.225.7 ± 1.10.33 ± 0.021.61 ± 0.15LHCIIb, CP29, and CP26 were prepared by IEF of BBY PSII particles.

For BBY particles, the molar ratios were estimated so as to give the measured percentage composition. There are two explanations for this discrepancy: first, there could be a pool of violaxanthin that is not bound to LHCII but is either free in the lipid phase of the membrane or bound to another protein complex. Second, violaxanthin is only rather loosely bound to LHCII and is removed during solubilization of the BBY particles and complex purification. To distinguish between these hypotheses, the distribution of pigment in LHCII fractions and free pigment was determined using sucrose gradient centrifugation following solubilization of BBY PSII membranes with three different concentrations of detergent (Fig. 1). In all cases, the distribution of Chl was approximately the same: about 60% in the LHCIIb trimeric band, approximately 15% in the monomer band (mainly minor complexes CP26, CP29, and CP24), and the remaining 25% in PSII core complexes. Less than 5% of the Chl was found in the free pigment zone. However, in contrast to these results, the distribution of violaxanthin was very dependent on detergent concentration. At the lowest detergent concentration, nearly 80% of the violaxanthin was in the trimeric LHCIIb fraction, and approximately 5% was in the free pigment zone. At the highest detergent concentration, this distribution was reversed, with over 80% in the free pigment zone and less than 5% in the LHCIIb trimers. The distribution of violaxanthin in the monomer fraction was approximately 20% at each detergent concentration. These data showed that the xanthophyll cycle carotenoid not associated with purified LHCII was loosely associated with the complexes in the thylakoid membrane. Moreover, with low detergent concentrations, violaxanthin could be retained bound to solubilized LHCII. Therefore, a different approach was taken to investigating the xanthophyll cycle content of the LHCII antenna: rather than isolating individual antenna complexes, gentle detergent treatment was used to try to remove an intact oligomeric PSII light harvesting system containing the complete xanthophyll cycle pool. Treatment of either BBY particles or thylakoids with carefully established detergent concentrations was found to produce a series of Chl-containing bands on a sucrose gradient (Fig.2). For BBY particles, there was less than 3% free Chl arising from this treatment, whereas there was none detectable with thylakoids. At 0.73 m sucrose, the band that contained 20–30% of the total Chl was referred to as the A-band. The A-band had a Chl a/b ratio of 1.61 and a low content of β-carotene compared with BBY particles, suggesting a deficiency in the CP47/CP43/RC core (Table I). The carotenoid/Chl ratio was higher than either purified LHCII or PSII, and the violaxanthin content was 26% of total carotenoid. The absorption spectrum was very similar to a spectrum of LHCIIb and was clearly enriched in Chl b absorption relative to PSII BBY particles (Fig.3 A). The fluorescence emission spectrum of the A-band was broader, red-shifted and of lower yield (approximately 50%) compared with LHCIIb (Fig. 3 B). The relative intensities of the vibronic satellite bands around 720 and 740 nm were also enhanced in the A-band. Solubilization of the A-band and further separation on a sucrose gradient showed that the fraction was heavily enriched in LHCIIb (Figs.2 and 4). At low DM concentrations, it was found that 64% Chl and 70% of the violaxanthin in the A-band was found in the trimeric LHCIIb fraction. This trimer had a xanthophyll cycle content of 22%. Negligible free pigment was observed. The absorption spectrum of the monomeric LHCII band at 0.43 msucrose was enriched in Chl b absorption around 650 nm compared with the spectrum of the monomeric band found when BBY particles are fully solubilized (Fig. 3 C). The latter is a mixture of the CP26 and CP29 (see Fig. 4), but the monomeric LHCII fraction obtained from the A-band therefore probably contains, in addition, some LHCIIb. The polypeptide composition of the A-band is shown in Fig. 4; several bands in the 25–31-kDa region are present. The Lhcb1–3 polypeptides of LHCIIb are shown, together with the polypeptides of CP26 and CP29. The trimer isolated from the A-band showed the presence of the Lhcb1–2 polypeptides, and these polypeptides were also detected in the monomer fraction. Densitometric estimates suggested that the Lhcb1–2 polypeptides accounted for more than 85% of the protein content in the A-band. These data showed that a major fraction of violaxanthin, mostly bound to LHCIIb, was easily lost upon detergent solubilization of either PSII membranes or oligomeric LHCII. Violaxanthin was clearly less tightly bound than Chl to this complex. Conversely, violaxanthin appeared to be more stably bound to monomeric minor LHCII. It was therefore decided to investigate in more depth the ease with which violaxanthin might be removed during detergent solubilization of LHCII, in comparison with the other bound pigments. Isolated LHCII fractions were incubated in different concentrations of DM and subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation. The amounts of different pigments in the LHCII fractions and free pigment zones were then analyzed. The results of this experiment using LHCIIb are shown in Fig.5. Treatment with a range of DM concentrations resulted in progressive loss of violaxanthin from this complex (Fig. 5 A). At the highest concentration, less than 10% of the violaxanthin remained in the trimer band, with nearly 70% being released into the free pigment zone. DM treatment removed approximately 4.0% Chl, highly enriched in Chl a, but more of the carotenoid (the carotenoid/Chl ratio was 0.72 in the free pigment fraction). In comparison with the original IEF sample, the free pigment was depleted in neoxanthin and lutein but contained 20% violaxanthin (Fig. 5 B). The carotenoids bound to the trimeric LHCII band contained less than 1% violaxanthin. Ten percent of the Chl was found in a monomeric band, and it was of note that this complex had a violaxanthin content of approximately 20% and a lower content of neoxanthin compared with the trimer. It was estimated that the amounts of lutein and neoxanthin removed from LHCIIb as free pigment by treatment with DM were only approximately 10 and 5%, respectively. LHCIIb trimers can be more efficiently broken into monomers by treatment with phospholipase (22Ruban A.V. Pesaresi P. Wacker U. Irrgang K.-D.J. Bassi R. Horton P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11586-11591Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The carotenoid composition of monomers was again different from trimers (data not shown). In particular, again it was found that neoxanthin was 30% reduced, and the violaxanthin content was over 20 times higher than for trimeric LHCIIb. Broadly similar behavior was displayed by CP29 and CP26, although some important differences were found (Fig.6). The free pigment zones again were enriched in carotenoid compared with the bands of purified LHCII (in this case a monomeric band), and differed in carotenoid composition (Fig. 6 A). The free pigment zone of CP26 was depleted in neoxanthin but enriched in both violaxanthin and lutein, compared with the initial IEF complex. Approximately 20% of Chl was removed by treatment with 0.2 mm DM, and this resulted in the loss of about 30% violaxanthin (Fig. 6 C). There was negligible loss of either lutein or neoxanthin. Higher concentration of DM caused extensive loss of Chl from CP26, so that it was not possible to attempt to selectively remove any greater proportion of violaxanthin. For CP29, the content of violaxanthin was almost the same in the IEF preparation, the free pigment zone, and the purified monomer, although there was some depletion in neoxanthin and enrichment in lutein in the free pigment zone (Fig. 6 B). A 20% loss in violaxanthin was accompanied by an almost equivalent loss of Chl (Fig. 6 D). As with CP26, higher concentrations of detergent removed Chl from the complex quite readily. Using the data obtained from treatment of the complexes with DM, an index of relative binding strength was calculated for each of the pigment types: the pigment content in the initial IEF fraction (as a percentage of total pigment) divided by the pigment content in the free pigment zone. This ratio was normalized on the value for lutein, the one carotenoid for which a binding site within the complex has been structurally determined. The rationale is that if all pigments are bound equivalently, then the composition of the pigments released into the free pigment fraction would be identical to the initial composition of the complex. For the LHCIIb trimer, neoxanthin was held as tightly as Chl b (Table II) This affinity was 5 times higher than lutein, which was in turn 5 times more strongly bound than violaxanthin, which was revealed to be the pigment most weakly associated with the trimeric complex. For LHCIIb monomers, lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin are bound with approximately equal efficiency, but less than Chl a and Chl b. For the minor complexes, neoxanthin was again the most tightly bound carotenoid, but the differences between the three carotenoids was much less. For CP26, violaxanthin and lutein were bound with equal strength, as for LHCIIb monomers. Violaxanthin was bound more efficiently than lutein to CP29.Table IIEfficiency of pigment binding to light harvesting complexes of photosystem IISampleDEPLutNeoVioZeaChl bChl aLHCIIb trimer−1.05.4 ± 2.00.2 ± 0.01—a—, nondetectable.5.1 ± 0.32.2 ± 0.3+1.04.3 ± 0.70.2 ± 0.020.7 ± 0.15.9 ± 0.52.4 ± 0.4LHCIIb monomer−1.01.0 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.1—3.3 ± 1.12.2 ± 0.3+1.00.7 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.20.7 ± 0.14.0 ± 1.22.7 ± 0.4CP26−1.02.2 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.2—4.5 ± 0.32.6 ± 0.3CP29−1.02.6 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.1—2.1 ± 0.22.1 ± 0.2+1.02.7 ± 0.31.6 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.5CP29 (thy)−1.01.9 ± 0.31.0 ± 0.2—1.9 ± 0.32.4 ± 0.4+1.02.4 ± 0.23.2 ± 0.40.5 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.2The relative binding efficiency of pigments to each complex was determined as the ratio of the amount of carotenoid in the complex divided by the amount in the free pigment.

Hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) markedly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and serine phosphorylation of Akt at 1 h after stimulation. Concommitantly, the association of FAK with phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH-kinase (PI 3-kinase) was also observed by the hydrogen peroxide stimulation. When T98G cells were incubated with wortmannin, a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, both PI 3-kinase activity and phosphorylation of Akt were inhibited, whereas apoptosis by oxidative stress was accelerated.

Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositide 3′-OH-kinase (PI 3-kinase) has recently been shown to be involved in cell survival. Growth factors activate PI 3-kinase, and p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase associates with specific phosphotyrosine either on the cytoplasmic domain of growth factor receptors or on receptor-associated adaptor proteins. One target of PI 3-kinase is the serine-threonine kinase Akt, also named PKBα (5Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Akt is a general mediator of growth factor-induced survival and has been shown to suppress apoptotic death by a variety of stimuli (5Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). Signaling via growth factor receptor activation leads to the sequential activation of PI 3-kinase and Akt. Recently, Datta et al.(7Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 17: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4957) Google Scholar) reported that Akt phosphorylates BAD in vitro andin vivo and blocks BAD-induced death of primary neurons. In eukaryotes, Bcl-2 family are central to the regulation of cell death. Several members of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, MCl-1, and A1) promote survival, whereas other members (Bcl-Xs, BAD, Bax, Bak) promote cell death (8Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R.

Bcl-2 family proteins homo- and heterodimerize, and the balance between homo- and heterodimers appears to be critical to the maintenance of cell survival and cell death. The mechanisms of Bcl-2 family members function yet remains to be determined. In a previous study (14Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we reported that hydrogen peroxide markedly induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) followed by the decrease of phosphorylation concomitant with apoptosis. Further, the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK by herbimycin A, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, accelerated apoptosis, and antisense oligonucleotides of FAK decreased cell viability. From these studies, we proposed an anti-apoptotic role of FAK in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. Based on these findings, we hypothesized FAK may be an upstream signal protein in the PI 3-kinase and Akt pathway and promotes cell survival against stresses in some cell types. Therefore, we examined the relationships between FAK, PI 3-kinase, Akt, Bcl-2 family proteins, and CPP32 protease (caspase-3) using a human glioblastoma cell line, T98G. To investigate the role of PI 3-kinase and Akt in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis, T98G cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) which caused tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and serine phosphorylation of Akt. We also found that the association of FAK with PI 3-kinase was stimulated by hydrogen peroxide. Interestingly, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin accelerated apoptosis and inhibited serine phosphorylation of Akt. Decreases in Bcl-2 protein and increases in Bax protein and CPP32 protease activity were observed concomitantly with apoptosis. These data suggested that the signal transduction from FAK to PI 3-kinase and Akt exerts an anti-apoptotic effect on apoptosis induced by oxidative stress and FAK locates in the upstream signal of the PI 3-kinase-Akt survival pathway in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis of T98G cells. T98G cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (Nippon Bio-Supply Center, Tokyo, Japan). For oxidative stress experiments, growing cells were subcultured at a density of 2 × 105/ml cell in medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (mAb: 4G10) and rabbit anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) Ab were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (NY), anti-FAK mAb from Transduction Laboratories (KY), goat anti-Bcl-2 Ab, rabbit anti-Bax Ab, and goat anti-CPP32 Ab from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, rabbit anti-Akt and phospho-Akt Abs from New England Biolabs. Inc. (MA), and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab from DAKO (Denmark). OPTI-MEM, Lipofectin reagent, and prestained molecular marker were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (MD). Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Tokyo, Japan). Substrates for protease activity, YVAD-MCA and DEVD-MCA, were obtained from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). T98G cells (5 × 106 cells) were incubated with hydrogen peroxide at various times, washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with lysis buffer as described previously (15Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 91: 9931-9935Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatants were incubated with anti-FAK mAb at 4 °C overnight. Immunocomplex was precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed as described previously (15Ruderman N.B. Kapeller R. White M.F. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 91: 9931-9935Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and 1 μCi [γ-32P]ATP in the reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, 200 μg/ml phosphatidylserine) at 25 °C for 10 min and terminated by addition of 100 μl of 1 m HCl. Phospholipids were then extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1). The organic layer was spotted onto a silica gel 60 plate (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) pretreated with 1% potassium oxalate. Thin-layer chromatography plates were developed with CHCl3/MeOH/acetone/CH3COOH/H2O (7:5:2:2:2), dried, visualized, and analyzed by Fuji image analyzer (Tokyo, Japan). For the preparation of cell lysate, 1 × 106 packed cells were lysed with lysis buffer as described previously (16Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yamaguchi Y. Kuno K. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15366-15372Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, Laemmli sample buffer was added to the cell lysate. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h and then incubated with primary Ab for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation with secondary Ab coupled to horseradish peroxidase, detection was made using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Molecular sizes were determined by the relative mobilities of prestained molecular weight markers. Densitometric analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer using the public domain NIH Image program. DNA fragmentation study was performed as described elsewhere (14Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were gently lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in a buffer containing 5 mmTris buffer (pH 7.4), 20 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, supernatants containing soluble fragmented DNA were collected and treated with RNase (20 μg/ml), followed by proteinase K (20 μg/ml). DNA fragments were precipitated in ethanol. Each sample was then electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by staining with 0.1% ethidium bromide. Cell viability was determined by Trypan blue dye exclusion, and the existence of apoptotic cells was confirmed by the appearance of sub-G0/G1 peak fractions in cell cycle analysis. For the cell cycle analysis, ethanol-fixed cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in the presence of RNase A (100 μg/ml, Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) and then analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter Calibur using a CELLQuest program (Becton Dickinson, CA). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cell lysate was prepared as described by Nicholson et al. (17Nicholson D.W. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). Cell lysate (50 μg of protein) was incubated at 37 °C with 50 mm DEVD-MCA as a substrate for apopain/CPP32, for 30 min, or YVAD-MCA as a substrate for ICE, for 60 min. The amounts of released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin were measured with fluorescence spectrofluorometer (Hitachi F-4000, Tokyo, Japan), with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. We have previously described that hydrogen peroxide induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of p125FAK in a human glioblastoma cell line, T98G (14Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To investigate the signal transduction from FAK, we examined whether FAK associates with PI 3-kinase, which has been reported to associate with FAK by stimulation of platelet-derived growth factor in NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast (18Chen H.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31229-31233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). T98G cells were treated with or without 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for various times. Lysates were prepared from these cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-FAK mAb, followed by the detection of its associated PI 3-kinase activities, as well as the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, and the FAK tyrosine phosphorylation. In response to hydrogen peroxide stimulation, a significant increase of PI 3-kinase activity (i.e.increases of 3-fold at 1 h and 10-fold at 2–4 h) was found in the anti-FAK immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 A). The product was confirmed as PtdIns 3-phosphate (PtdIns 3-P) by a comparison with the product of kinase assay using the immunoprecipitates with anti-PI 3-kinase Ab. The formation of PtdIns 3-P was completely inhibited (> 95% inhibition) by the 0.5 μm wortmannin (data not shown). The PI 3-kinase activity gradually increased and reached maximal at 2 h. Western blotting of anti-FAK immunoprecipitates with anti-p85 Ab paralleled with this observation (Fig. 1 B). Simultaneously, tyrosine phosphorylation of the anti-FAK immunoprecipitates were determined by using anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, indicating that FAK phosphorylation increased significantly at 1–2 h and maintained constant till 4 h (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK preceded the PI 3-kinase association with FAK in response to hydrogen peroxide stimulation. Of note is that blotting with anti-FAK mAb revealed the same amounts of FAK precipitated from all five samples (Fig. 1 D). These results suggested that PI 3-kinase associates clearly with tyrosine-phosphorylated FAK. It was recently reported that insulin-like growth factor 1 promotes cell survival by activating PI 3-kinase and its down-stream target, the serine-threonine kinase Akt (5Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of hydrogen peroxide on serine phosphorylation of Akt using anti-phospho-Akt Ab. The cell lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Akt or anti-Akt Abs. When lysates of hydrogen peroxide-treated cells were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-Akt Ab, the corresponding band of Akt was consistently detected up to 4 h after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide (Fig.2). Immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Akt Ab, which recognizes phosphorylated Ser-473 of Akt, revealed phosphorylation of Akt at 1 h after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide, which increased markedly till 4 h. Pretreatment with wortmannin (0.5 μm), a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor for 1 h, completely inhibited Akt phosphorylation. These findings suggested that FAK-associated PI 3-kinase activity is prerequisite for Akt activation.Figure 2Time course of Akt phosphorylation. T98G cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) with or without wortmannin (Wo) (0.5 μm) for various periods. Lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-phospho-Akt Ab or anti-Akt Ab.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We demonstrated previously that 1 mm hydrogen peroxide treatment for 15 h induced apoptosis in T98G cells (14Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When T98G cells were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for various periods, less than 12% of the cells died within 4 h by the estimation with trypan blue dye exclusion (Fig.3). To investigate the role of PI 3-kinase in apoptosis, we examined the effects of wortmannin. When T98G cells were pretreated with 0.5 μm wortmannin for 1 h, followed by treatment with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, more than 34% of the cells died within 4 h. Simultaneously, we estimated the DNA content of the cells using flow cytometry after staining with PI. DNA histogram of the PI-stained cells in Fig.4 indicated that 10% of hydrogen peroxide-treated cells (4 h) had hypodiploid DNA (Fig. 4 A), indicative of apoptosis, whereas untreated control cells contained less than 4% in this area. In the presence of wortmannin, hydrogen peroxide treatment for 4 h induced 40% of the cells with a hypodiploid DNA pattern, indicating that wortmannin enhanced hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis significantly (Fig. 4 B). Wortmannin alone did not induce apoptosis during these incubation periods (data not shown). In addition, when DNA fragmentation was analyzed, marked DNA ladder was observed after pretreatment with wortmannin for 1 h followed by hydrogen peroxide for 4 h (Fig.5 B), suggesting that these cells were apoptotic. No significant DNA fragmentation was induced by treatment with wortmannin alone (data not shown).Figure 4Flow cytometric analysis of T98G cells.PI-stained DNA histograms of drug-treated cells (black) compared with that of untreated cells (white) are shown, andApo indicates the cells with hypodiploid DNA.

Western blotting indicated the amounts of Bcl-2 and Bax in hydrogen peroxide-treated T98G cells were constant until 4 h after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 6). In the presence of wortmannin, however, Bcl-2 gradually decreased to one-tenth at 4 h, whereas Bax showed a 15-fold increase at 4 h. Thus, there appears to be an inverse correlation between expression of Bcl-2 and Bax in hydrogen peroxide- and wortmannin-induced apoptosis of T98G cells. The above data confirmed that Bcl-2 is down-regulated, whereas apoptosis-inducing Bax protein is up-regulated during apoptosis in some cell types (19Motyl T. Grzelkowska K. Zimowska W. Skierski J.

Cytometry. 1997; 27: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ICE family proteases have been reported to be activated in apoptosis (21Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwig E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). To examine the possible involvement of ICE family proteases in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis, we measured the activity of ICE protease and CPP32 protease using peptide substrates in cells treated with hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen peroxide and wortmannin, or wortmannin alone. Although ICE protease activity was not elevated (data not shown), CPP32 protease activity was significantly elevated in T98G cells when treated with wortmannin followed by hydrogen peroxide treatment for 4 h (Fig.7 A). CPP32 protease activity was not elevated in T98G cells treated with either hydrogen peroxide or wortmannin alone. Because it is known that CPP32 protease is synthesized as a 32-kDa inactive precursor which is proteolytically cleaved to produce a mature enzyme with 17- and 12-kDa subunits, we examined the cleavage of the CPP32 protein in response to apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 7 B, a 32-kDa CPP32 protein band disappeared upon the induction of apoptosis by the treatment with wortmannin and hydrogen peroxide. These results indicated that wortmannin and hydrogen peroxide treatment induced CPP32 cleavage to generate an active CPP32 fragment. Hydrogen peroxide alone had no significant effect on CPP32 protein levels (Fig. 7 B). We have reached the following conclusions in this paper. 1) Hydrogen peroxide stimulated the association of FAK with PI 3-kinase. 2) Wortmannin accelerated hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in T98G cells. 3) Hydrogen peroxide stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt. 4) When apoptosis occurred, CPP32 protease was activated, concomitant with the decrease of Bcl-2 protein and increase of Bax protein. 5) Phosphorylation of Akt is inhibited by wortmannin. Recently, we reported the anti-apoptotic role of FAK in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis (14Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, the association of FAK with PI 3-kinase, as well as serine phosphorylation of Akt occur in T98G cells after exposure to hydrogen peroxide. It should be mentioned that in the presence of wortmannin, PI 3-kinase activity and serine phosphorylation of Akt were inhibited with accelerating apoptosis. Putative downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase are the ribosomal protein kinase p70S6K, the Rho family Rac, and the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt/PKB. Akt/PKB, which is a cellular homolog of the retroviral oncogene v-akt, is also homologous to the PKA and PKC families of protein kinases. Akt is involved in the promotion of cell survival through inhibition of apoptosis, possibly playing a role in PI 3-kinase-mediated neuronal cell survival (5Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). As to a mode of survival signaling from Akt to BAD, Datta et al. (7Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 17: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (4957) Google Scholar) proposed that in the case of insulin-like growth factor 1 stimulation, Akt is activated via PI 3-kinase and activated Akt phosphorylated BAD, which dissociates from Bcl-XL or Bcl-2. Then, phosphorylated BAD is sequestered in the cytosol bound to 14–3-3 (22Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). As a result, Bcl-2 homodimer or Bcl-2-Bcl-XL heterodimer was formed, thereby leading to cell survival. The above idea appears to be consistent with our observation on the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis as shown in this study. In T98G cells, after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide, FAK was tyrosine-phosphorylated followed by the association and activation of PI 3-kinase. Activation of PI 3-kinase leads to the activation of Akt. Although we could not determine whether the target of Akt in the oxidative stress is BAD or not, Akt might regulate the balance of Bcl-2 family by phosphorylation of apoptosis-related proteins. In this study, the presence of Bcl-2 led to survival, whereas the increase of Bax, a BAD homolog, led to apoptosis. Although the mechanism of the function of Bcl-2 and Bax in apoptosis remains to be determined, Aritomiet al. (23Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Inohara N. Ishibashi Y. Ohta S. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27886-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) performed crystallographic studies indicating that Bax possesses a greater potential for membrane insertion than either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL, and thus Bax is likely to form membrane pores. They proposed that the roles of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 are to inhibit pore formation of Bax or other pore-forming proteins through heterodimerization. Taken together, we speculated that in signal transduction from FAK to PI 3-kinase, Akt plays a survival role by regulating the balance of apoptosis-blocking protein (Bcl-2) and apoptosis-inducing factor (Bax). In this study, Akt was translocated to the plasma membrane after stimulation with hydrogen peroxide, and this translocation was sensitive to wortmannin (data not shown). We propose the following model for FAK, PI 3-kinase, Akt, in the apoptosis. After exposure to hydrogen peroxide, FAK is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation, followed by PI 3-kinase activation and translocation of Akt to membrane. Akt is activated by serine phosphorylation and phosphorylates its target proteins in the cytosol, leading to the regulation of the balance of Bcl-2 family. Akt phosphorylation almost disappeared by the transfection of FAK antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides as previously employed (14Sonoda Y. Kasahara T. Yokota-Aizu E. Ueno M. Watanabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Taken collectively, FAK is an upstream signal protein of the PI 3-kinase-Akt survival pathway in hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis. Further analysis of T98G transfectants expressing active FAK or depletion of the FAK gene should provide more information on the role of FAK in apoptosis. We are grateful to Masaya Ueno for technical support and are grateful to Dr. Kazushige Yokoyama for the advice on the antisense design.

TNF signaling further involves intracellular membrane compartments like caveolae and endosomes harboring an acid SMase (A-SMase) (9Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M.

In addition, cytosolic protein kinase cascades including PKC and JNK have been identified to transmit TNF signals (33Schütze S. Nottrott S. Pfizenmaier K. Krönke M. J.

Strelow A. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).The question of how TNF signals are targeted to the different intracellular compartments is of fundamental biological significance. Intriguingly, rapidly diffusible ions like Ca2+ seem not to be involved in TNF signaling. Rather, the two lipid second messenger molecules 1,2-diacylglycerol and ceramide are likely to reside within membranes because of their hydrophobic nature. Thus the mechanisms of intracellular TNF signal trafficking remain obscure.In the present study we investigated the effects of inhibition of TNF receptor endocytosis on TNF signal transduction. Because structural motifs within the TNF receptor required for endocytosis are currently unknown, genetic approaches to block TNF receptor internalization are not available at present. We here employed the primary amine monodansylcadaverine (MDC) or K+ depletion to inhibit TNF receptor internalization. MDC is an inhibitor of transglutaminase, a membrane-bound enzyme that actively participates in internalization of various receptor systems (36Folk J.E. Chung S.H. Adv.

In contrast, TNF-dependent stimulation of plasmamembrane-associated N-SMase and PDP kinase are not affected by MDC or K+ depletion.DISCUSSIONIn the present paper the role of receptor internalization for TNF signaling was investigated. Intriguingly, inhibition of TR55 internalization by MDC or K+ depletion abolished select signaling events while leaving others unaffected. In particular, TNF-induced activation of A-SMase, JNK, and the induction of apoptosis were sensitive to MDC. In contrast, MDC did not inhibit TNF-induced activation of N-SMase and PDP kinases. Similar results were obtained with K+-depletion, which inhibited TNF receptor internalization and, like MDC, selectively blocked TNF-induced activation of A-SMase and JNK but not N-SMase or PDP kinases.MDC has been extensively used to block endocytosis and trafficking of various ligand-receptor systems. MDC is known as a potent competitive inhibitor of transglutaminase (36Folk J.E. Chung S.H. Adv. Enzymol. 1973; 38: 109-191PubMed Google Scholar, 37Davies P. Davis D. Levitzki F. Maxfield P.

The enzymatic action of transglutaminase involves cross-linking of proteins by forming an isopeptide bond between a lysine residue of one protein and a glutamine residue of another protein during coated pit formation. MDC has been shown to block endocytosis of α2-macroglobulin and many polypeptide hormones and cytokines like epidermal growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-I, and IL-8 (37Davies P.

Nature. 1979; 277: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). MDC-mediated inhibition of transglutaminase has also been implicated in the blocking of endocytosis of vesicular stomatitis virus, Semliki Forest virus, and other types of endocytosis occurring through clathrin-coated vesicles (61Marsh M. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 142: 439-454Google Scholar, 62Schlagal R. Dickson R.B. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2291-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). MDC does not affect the number or affinity of TNF receptors expressed on the cell surface (41Bradley J.R. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 12: 5544-5555Google Scholar). 2S. Schütze, unpublished observations. MDC blocked TNF receptor internalization at concentrations similar to the concentrations required for inhibition of transglutaminase in lysates from Chinese hamster ovary cells (37Davies P. Davis D. Levitzki F. Maxfield P. Milhaud M. Willingham C. Pastan I. Nature. 1980; 283: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), suggesting that the inhibition of this enzyme is related to the MDC effects on TNF receptor endocytosis. MDC concentrations exceeding 100 μm did not further increase the inhibitory effect on TNF receptor internalization in U937 cells. These findings are consistent with a previous study by Davies and co-workers, reporting on MDC-mediated inhibition of α2-macroglobulin receptor clustering (37Davies P. Davis D. Levitzki F. Maxfield P. Milhaud M. Willingham C. Pastan I. Nature. 1980; 283: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).The differential requirement of TR55 internalization for the activation of A-SMase and N-SMase are in concordance with a previous report by Hofmeister et al. in which the authors used an independent approach to study the functional consequences of IL-1 receptor internalization (63Hofmeister R. Wiegmann C. Korherr C. Bernado K. Krönke M. Falk W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27730-27736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An IL-1 receptor type I-positive EL4 thymoma cell line was employed, which is defective in the IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) required for IL-1 receptor internalization. In this IL-1R internalization-defective cell line, IL-1 induction of N-SMase appeared normal, whereas the activation of A-SMase was completely impaired. Transfection with IL-1RAcP cDNA restored IL-1 receptor internalization as well as IL-1-induced A-SMase stimulation, indicating the requirement of IL-1R internalization for A-SMase activation.Our findings on the differential requirement of receptor internalization for activation of A- and N-SMase may help to explain previous data by Andrieu et al. (51Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Jaffrezou J.P. Levade T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24518-24524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). These authors could not detect a requirement of TNF or IL-1 receptor internalization for sphingomyelin turnover. Here we show that it is only N-SMase that is insensitive to MDC or K+ depletion, whereas activation of A-SMase depends on TNF receptor internalization. Because the overall enzymatic activity of A-SMase exceeds that of N-SMase by a factors of 3–10, depending on the cell line investigated (Fig. 4 and Refs. 9Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar and65Boucher L.-M. Wiegmann K. Fütterer A. Pfeffer K. Machleidt T. Schütze S. Mak T.W. Krönke M. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 2059-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), the remaining N-SMase activity might have escaped the authors' detection system.A role for receptor clustering and internalization for activation of JNK has been also suggested by Rosette and Karin (64Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar), who report that exposure of HeLa cells to UV light or osmotic shock induced clustering and internalization of cell surface receptors for TNF, epidermal growth factor, and IL-1 in the absence of the respective ligands. UV or osmotic shock-induced activation of JNK could be inhibited by blocking receptor clustering at 10 °C or after receptor down-regulation, suggesting that multimerization and clustering of the cytokine receptors is the initial signaling event that activates the JNK cascade.Intriguingly, MDC blocked TR55-induced apoptosis. The doses of MDC required to inhibit TNF receptor endocytosis correlated well with those needed for the inhibition of TNF-induced cytotoxicity, consistent with the idea that TR55 internalization is required for apoptotic signaling. It is worth mentioning that MDC does not prevent apoptosis in a nonspecific manner. C6-ceramide, which is taken up through pinocytosis, triggered programmed cell death in the presence of MDC. In addition, CD95-mediated apoptosis of U937 and Jurkat cells was not prevented by MDC, suggesting that CD95-induced cell death is regulated by a mechanism distinct from clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis.Because the effects of MDC inhibition are presumably based on a blockade of protein cross-linking mediated by transglutaminase, the question is raised of whether MDC might disrupt the interaction of TRADD with the TR55 death domain. This would result in an uncoupling of death domain signaling independent of TR55 internalization. Our results, however, clearly show that association of TRADD to the death domain of TR55 was not impaired by MDC, suggesting that inhibition of A-SMase, JNK activation, and apoptosis by MDC does not result from disrupting the TRADD/TR55 signaling complex.The importance of TNF receptor internalization for signaling cell death is controversial. A functional role of TNF receptor internalization for mediating TNF cytotoxicity has been suggested previously by Kull and Cuatrecasas (55Kull F.C. Cuatrecasas P. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 4885-4890PubMed Google Scholar), Watanabe et al. (56Watanabe N. Kuriyama H. Sone H. Neda H. Yamauchi N. Maeda M. Niitsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10262-10266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Pastorinoet al. (32Pastorino J.G. Simbula G. Yamamoto K. Glascott P.A. Rothman R.J. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29792-29798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that a membrane-bound form (26 kDa) of TNF triggers cell death by direct cell-to-cell contact and, indeed, is apparently independent of TNF receptor internalization (57Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P.

Med. 1997; 185: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that membrane-bound TNF has been shown to preferentially trigger the p75 TNF receptor (TR75) (57Grell M. Douni E. Wajant H. Lohden M. Clauss M. Maxeiner B. Georgopoulos S. Lesslauer W. Kollias G. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell. 1995; 83: 793-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar). TNF binding to TR75 does not result in receptor internalization but rather triggers shedding of the TR75 (49Higuchi M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3550-3558PubMed Google Scholar, 50Porteu F. Hieblot C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2834-2840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, the mechanism by which TR75 signals cytotoxicity is different from the TR55 signaling pathway. Unlike membrane-bound TNF, soluble TNF binds and triggers TR55 that is readily internalized following ligand binding. Thus, the conflicting results can be explained by the engagement of distinct TNF receptors by membrane-bound and -soluble TNF, respectively.Our study implies that the functional consequences of TR55 endocytosis go beyond receptor degradation to terminate ligand-induced signaling. The results of our study indicate that TR55 internalization is crucially important for targeting and coupling of the TR55 adapter protein complexes to specific signaling systems like A-SMase, JNK, and a proapoptotic signaling cascade. TNF receptor endocytosis may play a previously unrecognized role in relaying TNF signals to intracellular compartments, where TNF receptor bearing membranes can be sensed as “signaling rafts.” Tumor necrosis factor (TNF),1 originally defined by its antitumoral activity, is now recognized as a pleiotropic cytokine exerting a wide variety of immunoregulatory activities (for review, see Refs. 1Goeddel D.V.

TNF action is mediated by two types of cell surface receptors of 55 kDa (TR55) and 75 kDa (TR75) molecular masses, respectively. Both receptors mediate distinct TNF responses (4Tartaglia L.A.

Like other cytokine receptors, the cytoplasmic domain of both TNF receptors lacks intrinsic enzymatic activities. The activation of intracellular signaling enzyme systems is initiated by a selective interplay between the cytoplasmic domain of the TNF receptors and a number of recently identified TNF receptor-associated proteins (see Ref.12Darnay B.G.

In addition, they are subject to phosphorylation by insulin, resulting in the activation of PPARα, while inhibiting PPARγ under certain conditions. However, it was hitherto unclear whether the stimulatory effect of insulin on PPARα was direct and by which mechanism it occurs. We now demonstrate that amino acids 1–92 of hPPARα contain an activation function (AF)-1-like domain, which is further activated by insulin through a pathway involving the mitogen-activated protein kinases p42 and p44. Further analysis of the amino-terminal region of PPARα revealed that the insulin-induced trans-activation occurs through the phosphorylation of two mitogen-activated protein kinase sites at positions 12 and 21, both of which are conserved across evolution. The characterization of a strong AF-1 region in PPARα, stimulating transcription one-fourth as strongly as the viral protein VP16, is compatible with the marked basal transcriptional activity of this isoform in transfection experiments. However, it is intriguing that the activity of this AF-1 region is modulated by the phosphorylation of two serine residues, both of which must be phosphorylated in order to activate transcription. This is in contrast to PPARγ2, which was previously shown to be phosphorylated at a single site in a motif that is not homologous to the sites now described in PPARα. Although the molecular details involved in the phosphorylation-dependent enhancement of the transcriptional activity of PPARα remain to be elucidated, we demonstrate that the effect of insulin on the AF-1 region of PPARα can be mimicked by the addition of triiodothyronine receptor β1, a strong binder of corepressor proteins. In addition, a triiodothyronine receptor β1 mutant deficient in interacting with corepressors is unable to activate PPARα. These observations suggest that the AF-1 region of PPARα is partially silenced by corepressor proteins, which might interact in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.

However, it remained unclear whether this represented a direct effect of insulin and by which mechanism insulin stimulated the activity of PPARα. The PPARα isoform is highly expressed in liver and brown adipose tissue, both of which are target tissues for insulin action (15Lemberger T. Braissant O. Juge-Aubry C. Keller H. Saladin R. Staels B.

PPARα binds and is activated by fibrates, certain fatty acids, arachidonic acid analogs (e.g. 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid), and leukotriene B4 (2Wilson T.M. Wahli W. Curr. Opin. Genet.

However, in transient transfection systems, PPARα exhibits strong transcriptional activity even in the absence of exogenous ligands (16Sher T. Yi H.F. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J.

Although this might be due to the presence of an endogenous stimulator, this activity could also be mediated through a constitutive trans-activating domain, similar to the activation function (AF)-1 region present in some other members of the nuclear receptor family, such as the retinoic acid and estrogen receptors (18Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 19Bunone G. Briand P.A. Miksicek R.J. Picard D.

Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Because we have previously demonstrated that PPARα is phosphorylated in response to insulin, resulting in the stimulation of basal as well as ligand-dependent transcriptional activity, we hypothesized that PPARα might contain a phosphorylation-regulated trans-activation domain (10Shalev A. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Yen P.M. Wahli W. Burger A.G. Chin W.W. Meier C.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4499-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that PPARα contains a ligand-independent transcriptional activation domain that might be subject to regulation by phosphorylation. We describe a novel AF-1 function within the A/B domain of PPARα, which harbors two consensus MAP-K sites, which are phosphorylated in response to insulin and both of which are necessary to mediate the insulin-induced transcriptional activation of PPARα. Intriguingly, these MAP-K sites are distinct from the inhibitory MAP-K site described for PPARγ. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the transcriptional activation of PPARα by insulin may involve the dissociation from co-repressor proteins, which may be related to the nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) and the silencing mediator for RAR and TR (SMRT) (21Hörlein A. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 22Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Hence, the insulin-induced phosphorylation of PPARα and γ is mediated through distinct phosphorylation motifs, resulting in transcriptional activation or repression, respectively. A fusion construct linking the GAL4-DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) upstream of the amino-terminal region (amino acids 1–92) of hPPARα was constructed by cloning the cDNA corresponding to the first 92 amino acids of hPPARα amplified by polymerase chain reaction using thePfu DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) into theBamHI and PstI sites of the pm-GAL4-BD expression plasmid (CLONTECH, Stehelin AG, Basel, Switzerland), resulting in the vector pm-GAL4BD-hPPARα. The expression plasmid pSG5-hPPARα was kindly provided by Dr. F. Gonzalez (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (16Sher T. Yi H.F. McBride O.W. Gonzalez F.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The final construct was verified by automated sequencing (ABI 373, Perkin-Elmer). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the entire pm-GAL4BD-hPPARα1–92 or pSG5-hPPARα plasmids with Pfu DNA using sense and antisense primers containing the desired mutation: S77A mutation (AGC → GCC), S76A (TCG → GCG), S12A (TCC → GCC), S21A (AGC → GCC) according to the manufacturer's protocol (QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis, Stratagene, Basel, Switzerland). The presence of the desired mutation and the absence of spurious mutations in the amplified cDNA was assessed by automated sequencing. The reporter plasmid pG5-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (CLONTECH, Stehelin AG, Basel, Switzerland) contains five consensus GAL4 binding sites (UASG 17-mer (×5)). As a positive control, the plasmid pM3-VP16, encoding a fusion protein of the GAL4 BD and the VP16 activation domain, was used. The reporter plasmid pBL-1xPPRE-MEp-CAT8+, containing the natural PPAR-response element from the malic enzyme promoter, was described previously (17Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G.

Twenty-four hours before cell harvesting, cells were treated with 1 μm insulin and/or 30 μm of the MAP-K p42/p44 inhibitor PD98059 (Alexis Corp., Läufelfingen, Switzerland) dissolved as described in the manufacturer instructions.

The results were quantitated by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and CAT activity was normalized to the protein concentration as measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). HepG2 cells were transfected with 4.6 μg of pm-GAL4BD or either wild-type or mutant pm-GAL4BD-hPPARα constructs. Twenty-four hours before harvesting, cells were incubated in serum-free and phosphate-depleted Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Basel, Switzerland) followed by labeling with [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h.

Immunoprecipitated products were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As described above, HepG2 cells were transfected with 4.6 μg of pm-GAL4BD or the appropriate pm-GAL4BD-hPPARα constructs. After 48 h, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated by using 1 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-GAL4BD antibody. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) for 45 min at 100 V (4 °C) in 25 mm Tris base, 190 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubating the membrane for 2 h in 5% powdered milk in TBST (20 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, pH 7.6). A monoclonal anti-GAL4BD antibody (CLONTECH, Stehelin AG, Basel, Switzerland) was added to a solution of 1% powdered milk/TBST for 12 h. The membrane was washed twice with TBST, followed by five rinses of 15 min each in TBST. The second antibody (anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (Santa-Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dr. Glaser AG, Basel, Switzerland)) was diluted (1:1000 v/v) and was added for 2 h at 4 °C. After incubation, the membrane was washed as described above. Immunolabeled proteins were revealed by chemiluminescence as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Zurich, Switzerland). In order to explore the possibility that the previously described significant constitutive activity of the full-length hPPARα is due to an AF-1-like function in the amino terminus of this protein, we created a fusion construct linking the GAL4 DNA-binding domain to the first 92 amino acids of hPPARα (pM-GAL4BD-hPPARα). The transcriptional response of this construct was assessed in transient transfection experiments in HepG2 cells using a UAS-CAT reporter (pG5-CAT). Fig. 1shows that the addition of the first 92 amino acids of hPPARα to the GAL4BD enhances the constitutive transcriptional activity over 20-fold, as compared with an 80-fold stimulation by the known strong transcriptional activator VP16. To examine whether the previously described stimulation of the basal transcriptional activity of PPARα by insulin might involve this novel AF-1 domain, similar experiments were performed in the presence of 1 μm insulin for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment with insulin enhances the activity of the amino terminus of PPARα over 4-fold, whereas no effect was seen on the control constructs GAL4BD and VP16. Because we have shown recently that insulin rapidly stimulates the phosphorylation of PPARα in adipose tissue and transfected cells, we also assessed the effect of insulin on PPARα in the presence of the specific inhibitor of the p42/44 MAP-K pathway PD98059 (25Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar). Compatible with the hypothesis that the stimulation of the amino terminus of PPARα by insulin involves a MAP-K-mediated phosphorylation event, PD95059 completely abolished this effect (Fig. 1). Because the results described above suggest that insulin modulates the basal transcriptional activity of PPARα through the phosphorylation of a MAP-K site in its amino terminus, we examined the known sequences of PPARα from various species for conserved MAP-K motifs (PX nSP) (Fig.2). Whereas several MAP-K motifs are present within the first 92 amino acids of hPPARα, three putative sites were highly conserved across evolution: serine 12, serine 21, and serine 77. Interestingly, the latter residue corresponds to a MAP-K motif described in mPPARγ2, which has been shown to be phosphorylated by MAP-K and results in an inhibition of transcription. Hence, we created the corresponding mutants of the pm-GAL4BD-hPPARα construct for the functional analysis of these sites (pM-GAL4BD-S12A, pm-GAL4BD-S21A, and pmGAL4BD-S76A/S77A). Using the various mutants of the putative MAP-K sites within the amino terminus of PPARα, we performed transient transfection experiments in HepG2 cells to assess their functional relevance. Fig. 3 shows that the serine to alanine mutations at positions 12 and 21 were both able to abolish the stimulatory effect of insulin, whereas similar mutations of another putative MAP-K site (Ser-76/77) did not alter the fold transcriptional stimulation by insulin. The lower transcriptional activity of the S76A/S77A mutant correlates with its lower expression as assessed in Western blot experiments (data not shown). These results are thus compatible with a model in which insulin activates the AF-1 region of PPARα through the MAP-K-mediated phosphorylation of serines 12 and 21. In order to test the hypothesis that insulin mediates the phosphorylation of serine residues 12 and 21, we performed phosphorylation experiments in HepG2 cells transfected with the appropriate wild-type and mutant pm-GAL4BD-PPARα constructs. Shown in Fig. 4 are the phosphorylated fusion proteins after precipitation with an anti-GAL4BD antibody, resulting in a main band at 39 kDa, corresponding to the apparent molecular mass of the GAL4BD-PPARα fusion protein (CLONTECH document 5399–1), as well as a smaller band, which is likely to correspond to a proteolytic fragment. These experiments demonstrated a 2.8-fold increased phosphorylation of wild-type GAL4BD-PPARα in response to insulin, which is quantitatively comparable to the 4.5-fold enhancement intrans-activation observed above. However, whereas the single mutants S12A and S21A were still phosphorylated by insulin, the double mutant S12A/S21A did not show an increase in its phosphorylation status after treatment with insulin. These data demonstrate that serines 12 and 21 are both phosphorylated by insulin and that no other residues contribute to the insulin-enhanced phosphorylation of the amino terminus of PPARα. In order to ascertain that the absent response of the GAL4BD-PPARα-S12A and S21A mutants was not due to the altered expression of these proteins, we performed Western blot analyses with an anti-GAL4BD antibody. As shown in Fig.5, the S12A and S12A/S21A mutants were expressed at similar levels as the wild-type protein, whereas the S21A mutant was somewhat less abundant. In order to examine the role of the Ser-12 and Ser-21 residues in the context of the intact hPPARα, both serines were mutated to alanine (pSG5-hPPARα-S12A/S21A). As shown in Fig.6, the wild-type intact hPPARα was activated by insulin in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.03, one-way analysis of variance), whereas the double-mutant S12A/S21A exhibited only a minimal and statistically not significant response to insulin (p > 0.2, one-way analysis of variance). Multiple scenarios can possibly explain how the phosphorylation of serines 12 and 21 activates transcription, such as the recruitment or dissociation of putative coactivator or corepressor proteins. Therefore, we hypothesized specifically that the phosphorylation event might result in the dissociation of a corepressor protein, such as NCoR or SMRT, thereby resulting in transcriptional derepression and hence activation. The testable prediction of this model is that the addition of a strong binder of such co-repressor proteins should exert an insulin-like stimulation on the AF-1 region of PPARα. In order to examine this hypothesis, we transfected HepG2 cells with GAL4BD-PPARα (amino acids 1–92) either alone or in the presence of increasing amounts of TRβ1, which is known to strongly interact with corepressor proteins (21Hörlein A. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar, 22Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the addition of TRβ1 was able to increase the transcriptional activity of the AF-1 domain of PPARα in a dose-dependent manner and to a level corresponding to that observed with insulin (Fig.7 A). However, to exclude the possibility that TRβ1 might squelch other proteins nonspecifically, a similar experiment was performed with a mutant TRβ1, known to be deficient in its interaction with corepressor proteins, such as NCoR and SMRT (TRβ1-ΔNCoR box). As shown in Fig. 7 B, this mutant has lost its capacity to activate PPARα, compatible with the model that TRβ1 competes for corepressor proteins, resulting in a derepression of the AF-1 domain of PPARα. The human PPARα was previously shown to exhibit significant ligand-independent transcriptional activity, which can be modulated by insulin (10Shalev A. Siegrist-Kaiser C.A. Yen P.M. Wahli W. Burger A.G. Chin W.W. Meier C.A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4499-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The observation that insulin also enhances the phosphorylation of PPAR in adipocytes as well as in transfected cells raised the possibility that insulin might directly phosphorylate PPARα, thereby enhancing its transcriptional capacity. In the present paper, (i) we demonstrate that the amino-terminal 92 amino acids of PPARα contain a AF-1-like trans-activation domain, which is further activated by insulin, (ii) we demonstrate that the effect of insulin on the AF-1 region is dependent on MAP-K p42/44 and involves the phosphorylation of two serine residues at positions 12 and 21, and (iii) we present data indicating that the phosphorylation of the amino terminus of PPARα may result in the dissociation of corepressor proteins, which may then result in a further transcriptional enhancement of this domain. The concept that nuclear hormone receptors contain a ligand-independent (AF-1) and a ligand-dependent (AF-2)trans-activation domain has been well demonstrated for the steroid and retinoid receptors (18Ali S. Metzger D. Bornert J.M. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 20Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 26Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, whereas the activity of the AF-2 domain is regulated by the binding of ligand resulting in the recruitment of coactivator proteins, the AF-1 region is conventionally thought to be constitutively active by molecular mechanisms that are poorly understood (27Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). The presence of a strong AF-1 region in the A/B domains of hPPARα shown in the present paper explains, at least in part, the basal activity observed with this PPAR isoform in transient transfection experiments. Interestingly, the present data demonstrate that this activity is subject to regulation through phosphorylation of two MAP-K sites. Because we have previously shown that PPARα is a phosphoprotein in primary adipocyte cultures stimulated with insulin, it is quite likely that the cross-talk between these two signaling pathways is of functional relevance. This notion is supported by our observation that the full-length PPARα is also activated by insulin and that this ligand-independenttrans-activation requires serines 12 and 21, compatible with the results obtained with the GAL4-PPARα 1–92 fusion construct. Although not statistically significant, the full-length S12A/S21A-PPARα retains a minimal residual response to insulin. However, this small effect is not mediated by the amino-terminal 92 amino acids, as supported by experiments with a PPARα deletion mutant lacking the amino terminus (data not shown). This residual stimulation by insulin may thus be mediated either through other regions of PPARα or through insulin effects on, for example, co-activators or the general transcriptional machinery. It is also of interest to note that treatment of primary hepatocytes with insulin for 3 days decreases the expression of the PPARα gene, suggesting that short-term exposure to insulin would increase trans-activation by PPARα (via the phosphorylation of PPARα), whereas a longer exposition to this hormone might result in the down-regulation of PPARα activity in liver (via the decreased expression of PPARα mRNA) (28Steineger H.H. Sorensen H.N. Tugwood J.D. Skrede S. Spydevold O. Gautvik K.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast to PPARα, the PPARγ2 isoform, which was recently shown to be phosphorylated in its amino terminus in response to activators of the MAP-K pathway, is inhibited after phosphorylation of a serine residue at position 112 as assessed by its adipogenic potential (11Hu E.D. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, when examined in different experimental systems or in the context of GAL4-fusion constructs, the amino terminus of PPARγ can also be stimulated by phosphorylation. Hence, it appears that at least in adipose tissue, which coexpresses the PPARα and γ isoforms at high levels, the phosphorylation by insulin has opposite effects on PPARα and γ, the former being activated, whereas the latter is inhibited. This observation, together with their different ligand binding spectrum and differences in DNA binding, provides a novel mechanism for generating isoform-specific responses of PPAR (17Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites in PPARα are highly conserved across species, and they are distinct from the homologous MAP-K site shown to be phosphorylated in γ2 (see Fig. 2). Hence, the functionally opposite effects of insulin on PPARα and γ2 are reflected by the presence of distinct phosphorylation sites. The mechanisms mediating phosphorylation-dependent alterations in transcription rates are still poorly understood, as is the case for the PPARs. Because the AF-1 domain as well as the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation sites colocalize within the same domain of PPARα, it is tempting to speculate that the altered phosphorylation results in the differential recruitment of coactivator and/or corepressor proteins. However, the currently known coactivator proteins interact preferentially in a ligand-dependent manner with the AF-2 domain of nuclear receptors, although some cooperation with AF-1 may occur (29Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Jänne O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 30Onate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12101-12108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). However, the corepressor proteins, such as NCoR and SMRT, interact with different regions of the nuclear receptors in a ligand-independent manner. Therefore, our finding that TRβ1 can activate the amino terminus of PPARα is of interest, because the TRs are known to strongly interact with NCoR and SMRT, thereby resulting in a putative intranuclear sink for corepressor proteins. Because this effect is abolished by a mutation in the NCoR box of TRβ1, it is tempting to speculate that the amino terminus of PPARα interacts with a NCoR-like corepressor protein that is able to partially silence the activity of AF-1. However, whether the phosphorylation of serines 12 and 21 derepresses AF-1 by inducing the dissociation of corepressors is a matter of conjecture. Although PPARγ was shown to interact with NCoR in solution, this interaction involved the hinge region of PPAR, rather than the amino terminus (31Zamir I. Zhang J.S. Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, some recent data demonstrate that an anti-NCoR antibody blocks the transcriptional repression of PPARγ by insulin, suggesting at least indirectly a functional interaction between the phosphorylated amino terminus of PPARγ and NCoR (32Lavinsky R.M. Jepsen K. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Mullen T.M. Schiff R. Del-Rio A.L. Ricote M. Ngo S. Gemsch J. Hilsenbeck S.G. Osborne C.K. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Rose D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2920-2925Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Preliminary experiments utilizing gel mobility shift and glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays examining the possibility of direct interactions of NCoR with the amino terminus of PPARα were inconclusive. 3C. Juge and C. A. Meier, unpublished data. These findings indicate that either the interactions between the AF-1 region of PPARα and NCoR are weak under the conditions used, or alternatively, novel corepressor proteins are involved, which have the potential to interact with the AF-1 region as well as the conventional NCoR box motif of nuclear receptors. In summary, we have demonstrated that PPARα contains a strong ligand-independent AF-1 domain, which can be further activated through the MAP-K-mediated phosphorylation of two serine residues, which are distinct from the inhibitory phosphorylation site present in PPARγ2. In addition, the AF-1 region of PPARα can be equally well activated by squelching corepressor proteins, suggesting that such proteins might silence the amino terminus of PPARα. It can thus be speculated that the phosphorylation of the AF-1 domain of PPARα might result in the dissociation of such corepressor proteins, thereby resulting in transcriptional activation."

We have previously reported that the functional activity of the GR is suppressed under oxidative conditions and restored in the presence of reducing reagents. In the present study, we have used a chimeric human GR fused to theAequorea green fluorescent protein and demonstrated that both ligand-dependent and -independent nuclear translocation of the GR is impaired under oxidative conditions in living cells. Substitution of Cys-481 for Ser within NL1 of the human GR resulted in reduction of sensitivity to oxidative treatment, strongly indicating that Cys-481 is one of the target amino acids for redox regulation of the receptor. Taken together, we may conclude that redox-dependent regulation of nuclear translocation of the GR constitutes an important mechanism for modulation of glucocorticoid-dependent signal transduction.

Glucocorticoids exert hormone action in target tissues via binding to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR).1 The GR, as a ligand-inducible transcription factor belonging to the nuclear receptor superfamily, is docked in the cytoplasm in the absence of hormonal ligands.

Although a number of transcription factors have been shown to be regulated in a redox-dependent fashion (reviewed in Refs. 20Sen C.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 21Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar, 22Sun Y. Oberley L.W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism for redox regulation of cellular GR remains largely unknown. From a signal transduction point of view, the glucocorticoid signal that finally influences gene expression must be transmitted to the nucleus via receptor translocation. Therefore, nuclear import of the GR is one of the key control points in regulation of glucocorticoid hormone action. In general, protein transport from the cytoplasm to the nucleus involves the nuclear localization signal (NLS), i.e.short peptide sequences that are necessary and sufficient for nuclear localization of their respective proteins (23Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized NLS motifs is that of SV40 large tumor antigen (T-ag) (23Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Nuclear import of the GR is mediated by NL1, a stretch of basic amino acids at the immediate C-terminal end of the receptor DNA binding domain, and a second significantly less characterized NLS in the ligand binding domain, NL2 (24Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Whereas the NLS of SV40 T-ag consists of a short domain of basic amino acids, NL1 of the GR is a bipartite domain and confers constitutive nuclear localization of the receptor (24Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). In contrast, NL2 acts as a dominant negative NLS in the absence of ligands (24Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). A number of studies have proven that the GR shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and subcellular localization of the GR is determined by an equilibrium of both nuclear import and export. The GR translocates to the nucleus in a ligand- and energy-dependent manner, and nuclear export of the GR also requires ATP (25Hsu S. Qi M. DeFranco D.B.

On the other hand, subcellular localization of certain transcription factors is conditionally regulated to confer extracellular stimulus-dependent gene expression. For example, cellular treatment with tumor growth factor-β causes nuclear translocation of the transcription factors Smad3/Smad4 (35Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar).

In the case of the GR, it is well known that glucocorticoid ligands are a unique molecular switch to trigger nuclear translocation of the receptor; however, it has not yet been documented whether the cellular redox state modulates subcellular localization of the receptor. In the present study, we have used a fusion protein of human GR andAequorea green fluorescent protein (GFP) to study nuclear translocation of the GR in living cells (26Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Using this model system, we demonstrate that not only ligand-dependent but also ligand-independent nuclear import of the GR is negatively modulated under oxidative conditions, illustrating the critical importance of the cellular redox state in modulation of GR-mediated signal transduction. Dexamethasone was purchased from Sigma, and other chemicals were from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan) unless otherwise specified. The expression plasmid for the chimeric protein of GFP and the human GR, pGFP-hGR, was described previously (referred to as pCMX-GFP-hGR in Ref. 26Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The construction of pCMX-GFP-VP16-GR DBD, which encodes fusion protein for GFP, VP16 transactivation domain, and the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the human GR (serine 403 to leucine 532), is described elsewhere (15Makino Y. Yoshikawa N. Okamoto K. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3182-3188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). pGFP-hGR/C481S, which carries a TGT to TCT point mutation to generate a cysteine for serine substitution at position 481 in the human GR, was constructed using pGFP-hGR as a template with the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-GCATGCCGCTATCGAAAATCTCTTCAGGCTGGAATGAACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTCATTCCAGCCTGAAGAGATTTTCGATAGCGGCATGC-3′. pCMX-GFP-VP16-GR DBD/C481S was constructed in a similar fashion using pCMX-GFP-VP16-GR DBD as a template with the identical pair of primers. The resulting plasmid constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The glucocorticoid-responsive reporter plasmid pGRE-Luc has been described elsewhere, in which the firefly luciferase gene expression is driven under the control of a tandem repeat of glucocorticoid response elements (17Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was used as an internal control for transfection efficiency when appropriate. The human GR-expressing CHO cells, CHOpMTGR, were originally developed and kindly provided by Dr. Stefan Nilsson (Karo Bio, Huddinge, Sweden) and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) (37Alksnis M. Barkhem T. Strömstedt P.-E. Ahola H. Kutoh E. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Nilsson S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10078-10085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS7 cells and HeLa cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba Science City, Japan) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Iwaki Glass Inc., Chiba, Japan). CHO-K1 cells were obtained from the RIKEN Cell Bank and maintained in Ham's F-12 medium. All media used in this study were phenol red-free and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. Serum steroids were stripped with dextran-coated charcoal (DCC), and cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2 unless otherwise specified. Cells grown on eight-chambered sterile glass slides (Nippon Becton & Dickinson, Tokyo, Japan) were fixed for immunostaining using a freshly prepared solution of 4% paraformaldehyde (w/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4 °C. Immunocytochemistry was carried out as described previously (38Tanaka H. Makino Y. Miura T. Hirano F. Okamoto K. Komura K. Sato Y. Makino I. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1601-1608PubMed Google Scholar) with a small modification. Briefly, cells were washed five times with PBS at room temperature and incubated with anti-human GR polyclonal rabbit antibody PA1–512 (Affinity Bioreagents, Neshanic Station, NJ) at 2 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 9 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed five times with PBS and incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit Ig species-specific whole antibody from donkey at a dilution of 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature, and then the cells were washed five times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated streptoavidin at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the cells were washed five times with PBS and mounted with GEL/MOUNTTM (Biomeda Co. Ltd., Foster city, CA) and then examined by a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope equipped with a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set. Before transfection, cell culture medium was replaced with Opti-MEM medium lacking phenol red (Life Technologies). A plasmid mixture containing pGRE-Luc in the presence or absence of pGFP-human GR expression plasmids was mixed with TransIT-LT1 reagent (Panvera Corp., Madison, WI) and added to the culture. The total amount of the plasmids was kept constant by adding an irrelevant plasmid (pGEM3Z was used unless otherwise specified). After 6 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM supplemented with 2% DCC-treated FCS, and the cells were further cultured in the presence or absence of various ligands for 24 h at 30 °C to increase transactivation function of expressed GFP-hGR (26Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Luciferase enzyme activity was determined using a luminometer (Berthold GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad, Germany) essentially as described before (17Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For analysis of nuclear translocation of the GR in living cells, we transiently expressed GFP-tagged human GR or its mutants in COS7 cells. The cells were cultured on the silane-coated coverslips in 6-cm diameter plastic dishes, and the medium was changed to Opti-MEM medium lacking phenol red before transfection. A plasmid mixture containing 6 μg of expression plasmids for various GFP-tagged proteins was mixed with 12 μl of TransIT-LT1 reagent and added to the culture. After 6 h of incubation, the medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% DCC-treated FCS, and the cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h, at 30 °C for at least 4 h, and then at 37 °C thereafter. GFP was expressed at detectable levels between 24 and 72 h after transfection. Routinely, cells were used for further experiments 48 h after transfection. After various treatments, cells were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope enclosed by an incubator and equipped with a heating stage, a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set, and epifluorescence with illumination from a Gixenon burner (26Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Quantitative assessment of the subcellular localization of expressed GFP fusion proteins was performed according to methods described elsewhere (39Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, subcellular localization analysis of GFP-tagged proteins was performed by blinded observers, counting approximately 200 cells in which GFP fluorescence was detected. The GFP fluorescence-positive cells were classified into four different categories: N < C for cytoplasmic dominant fluorescence; N = C, cells having equal distribution of fluorescence in the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments; N > C for nuclear-dominant fluorescence; and N for exclusive nuclear fluorescence. Whole cell extract was prepared by lysing cells treated with dexamethasone and/or H2O2 in 25 mm N-Tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (pH 8.2), 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmmolybdate, and 10% glycerol. Immunoprecipitation experiments, with either the anti-hsp90 IgM antibody 3G3 (Affinity Bioreagents) or control mouse IgM antibody TEPC 183 (Sigma) was carried out as described previously (40McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, goat anti-mouse IgM (Sigma) was coupled to CNBr- activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by incubating in the coupling buffer (0.1 mNaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3) overnight at 4 °C. Thirty-five micrograms of either the monoclonal anti-hsp90 IgM antibody or control mouse IgM antibody was then incubated with 80 μl of a 1:1 suspension of the goat anti-mouse IgM antibody coupled to Sepharose in MENG buffer (25 mm Mops (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, 10% glycerol) on ice for 90 min. This Sepharose-adsorbed material was then pelleted and washed successively once with 1 ml of MENG buffer containing 0.5 mNaCl and twice with MENG buffer containing 20 mm sodium molybdate. After brief centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of MENG buffer containing 20 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 m NaCl, and 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. In immunoprecipitation experiments, 66 μg of cellular protein was added to the resuspension. The reaction mixtures were incubated on ice for 90 min, after which Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times with MENG buffer containing 20 mm sodium molybdate and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrically transferred to an Immobilon-NC Pure (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Subsequently, immunoblotting was performed with a monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) diluted at 1:500 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted at 1:750. In parallel, 20 μg of whole cell extracts was independently used for immunodetection of GFP-hGR and hsp90. Western immunoblot analysis for detection of hsp90 was performed in the same membrane after stripping off the immune complex for the detection of GFP-hGR, using monoclonal mouse anti-hsp90 IgG antibody 3B6 (Affinity Bioreagents) diluted at 1:500 followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig diluted at 1:750. Antibody-protein complexes were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After autoradiography, intensities of the appropriate bands for GFP-hGR and hsp90 were quantified using a densitometer. Recombinant GST-NLSc-GFP, encoding the NLS of SV40 T-ag, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and GFP, was prepared as described previously (41Jewell C.M. Webster J.C. Burnstein K.L. Sar M. Bodwell J.E. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Glass capillary-mediated transfer of the recombinant protein was carried out using a Leitz micromanipulator as also described previously (41Jewell C.M. Webster J.C. Burnstein K.L. Sar M. Bodwell J.E. Cidlowski J.A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 55: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, COS7 cells were plated on the silane-coated coverslips in 35-mm diameter dishes in DMEM supplemented with 2% DCC-stripped FCS and treated with or without 2 mmH2O2 for 2 h. The medium was then changed to H2O2-free medium just prior to the injection. Microinjection of the recombinant protein was performed within the ensuing 5 min (approximately 30 cells were injected per dish) and the medium was immediately changed to DMEM containing 2% DCC-treated FCS with or without 2 mm of H2O2. Subcellular localization of the protein was monitored by fluorescent microscopy, and photographs were taken at intervals of 1 min for 20 min. We recently reported that the functional activities of the GR, including ligand binding, DNA binding, and transactivation, are strictly controlled by the cellular redox state. Since, as described in the Introduction, nuclear translocation is a prerequisite for the GR to mediate hormone signaling, we wanted to examine whether subcellular localization of the GR is modulated via redox-dependent mechanisms. For this purpose, first, we assessed whether treatment with H2O2 influenced subcellular localization of the GR by indirect immunofluorescent analysis using human GR-expressing CHOpMTGR cells. As shown in Fig. 1, we found that ligand-dependent nuclear targeting of the human GR is markedly inhibited after treatment with 1 mmH2O2, whereas pretreatment withN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) effectively titrates this negative effect of H2O2. Based on these results, we decided to transiently express GFP-hGR chimeric protein (26Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) to perform a kinetic analysis of subcellular localization of the GR in living cells with special reference to the regulatory role of cellular redox state. In these experiments, we also examined whether the nuclear translocation process was individually controlled via a redox-dependent mechanism. To this end, we tested whether GFP-hGR mimics endogenous GR in terms of ligand-dependent nuclear translocation and transactivation using COS7 cells, since those cells show relatively high transfection efficiency. After transient transfection of GFP-hGR into COS7 cells, 20–30% of the cells showed cytoplasmic green fluorescence, indicating expression of GFP-hGR fusion protein in those cells. In the absence of hormone, expressed GFP-hGR chimera localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, whereas it translocated into the nucleus in a time-dependent manner after hormone treatment (Fig.2, and data not shown). Quantitative analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”) also revealed a strict ligand concentration dependence of nuclear translocation of GFP-hGR (Fig. 2). This hormone-dependent nuclear localization of GFP-hGR correlated with reporter gene expression (data not shown). We also performed similar experiments using CHO-K1 cells and HeLa cells and found that, despite significantly lower transfection efficiency, GFP-hGR again mimics native GR in these cells as well (data not shown). Therefore, although GFP was present in the N-terminal end of the human GR, we concluded that GFP-hGR mimics the native human GR, at least with reference to ligand-dependent translocation and transactivation properties (26Ogawa H. Inouye S. Tsuji F.I. Yasuda K. Umesono K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J.

A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We next examined the effect of oxidative treatment on nuclear translocation of GFP-hGR in COS7 cells. As shown in Fig.3, the rate of ligand-dependent nuclear translocation of GFP-hGR was markedly delayed upon the addition of H2O2. This suppressive effect of H2O2 was dose-dependent (Fig. 3). Indeed, in the presence of 2 mm H2O2, nuclear translocation was severely compromised even after treatment with 100 nmdexamethasone (Fig. 3). Neither distribution nor intensity of GFP fluorescence was significantly influenced after treatment with H2O2 when GFP alone was expressed in COS7 cells (data not shown and Fig. 5). To test the reversibility of H2O2-dependent suppression of nuclear translocation, GFP-hGR-expressing COS7 cells were treated with 10 mm NAC after 1-h treatment with 2 mmH2O2 and 100 nm dexamethasone. As shown in Fig. 3, NAC partially but efficiently reversed the negative effects of 2 mm H2O2, resulting in the nuclear translocation of GFP-hGR in the presence of 100 nm dexamethasone. These results strongly indicate that the suppressive effects of H2O2 can be inhibited by the addition of reducing reagents and do not appear to be related to a decrease in cell viability.Figure 5Effect of oxidative treatment on ligand-independent nuclear translocation of the GR. COS7 cells were transfected with the expression plasmid for GFP-VP16-GR DBD and cultured for 12 h in the absence or presence of H2O2. Then photographs were taken as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also compared the sensitivity to H2O2 of nuclear translocation of GFP-hGR in COS7 cells, CHO-K1, and HeLa cells, all of which revealed almost complete nuclear translocation of GFP-hGR after treatment with 100 nm dexamethasone in 2 h (data not shown). When concentration-dependent curves were compared, the different cells showed the following rank order of sensitivity to oxidative treatment: HeLa, CHO-K1, and COS7 cells. IC50 values for inhibition of nuclear translocation of GFP-hGR were 0.49, 0.78, and 1.00 mm for HeLa, CHO-K1, and COS7 cells, respectively. These data indicate that, despite variation in sensitivity to oxidative treatment, oxidative inhibition of nuclear translocation of the GR may be a general phenomenon. To assess the mechanism of oxidation-mediated repression of GR nuclear translocation, we investigated whether treatment with H2O2influenced the ligand-dependent dissociation between the GR and hsp90, since we previously have reported that oxidative treatment decreases ligand binding activity of the GR (16Okamoto K. Tanaka H. Makino Y. Makino I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Makino Y. Okamoto K. Yoshikawa N. Aoshima M. Hirota K. Yodoi J. Umesono K. Makino I. Tanaka H. J. Clin.

DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). First, to demonstrate interaction between the GR and hsp90, we employed in coimmunoprecipitation experiments a monoclonal IgM antibody capable of recognizing both free hsp90 and hsp90 complexed with other proteins (40McGuire J. Whitelaw M.L. Pongratz I. Gustafsson J.-Å. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2438-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These experiments revealed that GFP-hGR coprecipitated with hsp90 using whole cell extracts from pGFP-hGR-transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, only background levels of GFP-hGR were coprecipitated by control IgM antibodies (Fig. 4 A), indicating that GFP-hGR as well as native human GR forms a stable complex with hsp90 in solution in the absence of ligands. The IgM anti-hsp90 antibody did not react with GFP itself (data not shown). We then examined the eff"

Northern blot analysis was performed using this homologous cDNA as a probe, which demonstrated ubiquitous expression of messages of 5.1 and 2.0 kilobases in a number of human tissues and in several human cancer cell lines. Since the human lymphoma Raji cell line had the highest level of expression, it was used to isolate a full-length cDNA clone. The full-length cDNA was found to contain an open reading frame that predicted a type II transmembrane protein composed of 406 amino acid residues.

Analysis of [35S]sulfate-labeled disaccharide products of chondroitin ABC, chondroitin AC, and chondroitin B lyase treatment demonstrated that the enzyme only transferred sulfate to the 2-position of uronyl residues, which were preponderantly iduronyl residues in dermatan sulfate, but some lesser transfer to glucuronyl residues of chondroitin sulfate.

Some 2-sulfation of GlcA on chondroitin sulfate has also been found but only next to GalNAc 6-sulfate rather than GalNAc 4-sulfate.

Although there is little information concerning detailed biological activities based on the structural diversity of the dermatan sulfate, the 2-sulfation of IdceA would appear to be of special interest.

It seemed likely that this enzyme would have similarities to IdceA 2-sulfotransferase for dermatan sulfate. Therefore, in an attempt to find such an IdceA 2-sulfotransferase, we employed the heparan sulfate IdceA 2-sulfotransferase sequence to obtain a related expressed sequence-tagged (EST) clone. This provided for the molecular cloning of a human cDNA which we found to encode a uronyl 2-sulfotransferase. We have found this enzyme to have no 2-sulfotransferase activity with heparan sulfate but to be involved in the sulfation of the IdceA residues of dermatan sulfate with some lesser activity in 2-sulfation of GlcA residues in chondroitin sulfate. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) data bank of I.M.A.G.E. Consortium (Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) EST cDNA clones (21Lennon G. Auffray C. Polymeropoulo M. Soares M.B. Genomics. 1996; 33: 151-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar) was probed with a deduced CHO cell heparan sulfate 2- sulfotransferase sequence (15Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Clone ID HE9MJ06 was obtained from the TIGR/ATCC Special Collection (ATCC). This was a partial-length EST clone from a 9-week-old human embryo, in which only 248 bp of sequence (positions 473–720, Fig. 1) was present in the data base (22Adams M.D. Kerlavage A.R. Fleischmann R.D. Fuldner R.A. Bult C.J. Lee N.H. Kirkness E.F. Weinstock K.G. Gocayne J.D. White O. Sutton G. Blake J.A. Brandon R.C. Man-Wai C. Clayton R.A. et al.Nature. 1995; 377: 3-174PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNA from this clone was inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the Bluescript SK− plasmid and carried in an Escherichia coli host strain. The pBluescript plasmid DNA was purified from the host bacteria using QIAfilter plasmid kits (Qiagen) and used to prepare a PCR probe consisting of a 614-bp fragment at positions 473–1086 as shown in Fig.1 using 20-bp oligonucleotides of both ends as primers. The PCR was carried out in a 50-μl volume containing 0.5 μm each primer, 40 ng of the template, 0.2 mm each dNTP, and 1.25 units of Taq2000TM DNA polymerase (Stratagene) under the conditions of 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 56 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and an amplified DNA band of ∼600 bp was excised, recovered from the gel using QIAEX II (Qiagen), and radiolabeled for the probe using [α-32P]dATP and a Prime-It II random primer labeling kit (Stratagene). To obtain full-length clones, we first scanned tissue-specific and cell type-specific expression of the cDNA by Northern blot hybridization using the32P-labeled PCR probe. Tissue type-specific expression of presumptive 2-sulfotransferase cDNA was analyzed with human RNA Master BlotTM and human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTNTM) Blot (CLONTECH) membranes and cell type-specific expression with a human cancer cell line Multiple Tissue Northern (MTNTM) Blot (CLONTECH) membrane. Each Northern analysis was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol with some modifications. The Master Blot membrane was prehybridized in an ExpressHyb solution containing 100 μg/ml denatured sheared salmon testes DNA (Sigma) at 65 °C for 30 min, hybridized in the same solution containing the denatured32P-labeled probe, 6 μg/ml human Cot-1 DNA (Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.2× SSC at 65 °C for 16 h, and washed four times with 2× SSC, 1% SDS at 65 °C for 20 min, twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 55 °C for 20 min. The human and cancer cell line MTN Blot membranes were prehybridized in an ExpressHyb at 68 °C for 30 min, hybridized in the same solution containing the32P-labeled probe at 68 °C for 16 h, and washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at 22 °C for 20 min, twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min. The membranes were then exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −80 °C. The human lymphoma 5′-STRETCH PLUS cDNA library (CLONTECH) was constructed from mRNA from Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cell line atEcoRI-cloning sites of the λgt11 vector by the priming method with oligo(dT) and random primers. The host strain Y1090r− cells were infected with phage from the library, plated at 4 × 105 plaque-forming units/dish, and approximately 1.2 × 106 plaques were screened. Colony/Plaque screenTM (NEN Life Science Products) membrane replicas of the plaques were fixed by the rapid autoclave method recommended by the manufacturer, prehybridized in an ExpressHybTMhybridization solution (CLONTECH) for 30 min at 68 °C, and hybridized in the same solution containing the denatured32P-labeled probe at 68 °C according to the manufacturer's protocol with a 16-h modification. The filters were washed twice with 2× sodium citrate-sodium chloride (SCC), 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 20 min at 22 °C, and then twice with 0.1× SCC, 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 50 °C. The positive clones were detected by autoradiography. Plaque solutions from the positive clones were initially characterized with LD-insert screening amplimer sets (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's PCR protocol. The resultant PCR products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the sizes of the inserts, recovered from the gel, and sequenced. λgt11 DNA of the clones was isolated from its plate lysate using a Qiagen lambda kit (Qiagen), subcloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) at the EcoRI sites, and sequenced again to confirm sequence data. For DNA sequencing, the 5′ and 3′ insert regions were enzymatically sequenced from flanking primer sites of the respective PCR fragments or vectors. The remaining sequences of both strands were obtained with internally priming oligonucleotides. Primers were spaced no more than 400 bp apart with a 200-bp offset between sense and antisense strands. Automated fluorescence sequencing was performed with Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems models 373A and 477 DNA Sequencers. The DNA sequence files obtained were aligned and compiled with Sequencher (Gene Codes Corp.) and GENETYX-MAC (Software Development Corp.) computer programs. Sequence comparison searches were performed on the data bases of GenBankTM, EMBL, PDB, SwissProt, SPupdate, PIR, and dbEST. ThePvuII-EcoRI fragment containing the coding region from positions 193 to 1,382 shown in Fig. 1 was excised from the λgt11 cloning vector, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated into the StuI site of the pFASTBACTM HTa plasmid (Life Technologies, Inc.). The recombinant bacmid-sulfotransferase (presumptive) molecules were then produced by Tn7-mediated site-specific transposition when MAX EFFICIENCY DH10BACTMcompetent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transformed with the recombinant pFASTBAC HTa donor plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant molecules were isolated and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and PCR with vector and gene-specific primers to confirm the presence of bacmid high molecular weight DNA and the correct orientation of the inserted cDNA. Recombinant bacmid-heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase DNA that contained the entire coding region of its cDNA (SacII-AflII fragment) (15Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was also constructed and used for control experiments. cDNA was expressed using a BAC-TO-BACTM HT baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modifications. Sf9 insect cells (Invitrogen) seeded onto 35-mm culture dishes containing 2 ml of SF-900 II SFM (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transfected with bacmid-sulfotransferase (presumptive) or bacmid-heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase using CELLFECTINTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium was replaced with Grace's insect medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), and the culture was continued for another 3 days at 27 °C. The spent medium was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g to obtain the virus-containing supernatant as viral stock. 150-mm Petri dishes of Sf9 cells were then infected by each recombinant viral stock and incubated at 27 °C for 3 days. After collecting the spent medium, the 150-mm Petri dishes of infected Sf9 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and homogenized in a 3-ml solution of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (5 μm Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 3 μm N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 30 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 3 μmpepstatin A) as described previously (15Kobayashi M.

After 1 h of gentle stirring at 4 °C, the homogenate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 10,000 × g. Sulfotransferase activities in the supernatant fractions (cell extracts) were measured as described below. Protein contents of the cell extracts were estimated by a micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Completely desulfated and N-resulfated heparin (CDSNS-heparin) and shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate C (4-sulfate:6-sulfate, 10:90) were obtained from Seikagaku; porcine skin dermatan sulfate was obtained from Sigma. Chemical desulfation (23Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1979; 86: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was used to obtain dermatan and chondroitin, which resulted in apparent complete desulfation of the chondroitin but left small amounts of 4-sulfate on the dermatan. A standard reaction mixture (25 μl) contained 1.25 μmol of imidazole HCl, pH 6.8, 1.88 μg of protamine chloride, 12.5 μg of glycosaminoglycan, 0.5 nmol (2.5 μCi/nmol) of 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate (NEN Life Science Products, Inc.), and 5 μl of the cell extract. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixtures were directly spotted on Whatman No. 1 paper and chromatographed in ethanol, 1 m ammonium acetate (5:2 (v/v)) overnight. The origins, which contained the sulfated products, were assayed for radioactivity as described previously (24Sugumaran G. Humphries D.E. Silbert J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 428-434Google Scholar). In order to obtain sufficient labeled products for detailed analyses, higher specific activity 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate (∼150 μCi/nmol) prepared as described previously (25Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was used. After phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) treatment and subsequent ethanol precipitation, the 35S-labeled glycosaminoglycans were digested with protease-free chondroitin ABC lyase (20 milliunits/μg substrate), chondroitin AC I lyase (10 milliunits/μg substrate), or chondroitin B lyase (100 milliunits/μg substrate) (Seikagaku Corp.) for 16 h at 37 °C (30 °C for B lyase) and boiled at 100 °C for 1 min to terminate the reaction. Products (∼9,000 cpm) were applied on Bio-Gel P-2 (Bio-Rad) columns (0.75 × 200 cm) that were equilibrated and eluted with 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 4 ml/h and assayed for radioactivity. Aliquots of the boiled ABC lyase degradation mixtures were then incubated for an additional 16 h at 37 °C with (a) Δ4,5hexuronate-2-sulfatase (10 milliunits/μg substrate (provided by K. Yoshida, Seikagaku Corp.) (26McLean M.W. Bruce J.S. Long W.F. Williamson F.B. Eur. J.

Ohi Y. Harada T. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6027-6035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions of 0.5 ml were collected and mixed with 6 ml of EcoLumeTM (ICN Biomedicals), and the radioactivity was determined. In order to screen for IdceA 2-sulfotransferases the NCBI Data Bank of EST cDNA clones was probed with the deduced amino acid sequence of CHO cell heparan sulfate IdceA 2-sulfotransferase cDNA (15Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M. Habuchi O. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13980-13985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” a human partial-length cDNA clone, Clone ID HE9MJ06, was found, encoding a novel related species. The cDNA from this clone was 3,743-bp (positions 473–4215) in length as shown in Fig. 1. The 614-bp (positions 473–1086) PCR probe for library screening and Northern hybridization was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Approximately 1.2 × 106 plaques of a λgt11 human lymphoma Raji cell cDNA library were screened using this PCR fragment as a probe, resulting in 25 positive clones. Sixteen insert cDNAs of these clones were selected, amplified, and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures,” but only one (1.4 kb) appeared to have the complete coding sequence of the presumptive sulfotransferase. The amino-terminal sequence of this clone was found to contain three in-frame ATG codons and a TGA stop codon in frame at position 56 upstream from the first ATG codon. A single open reading frame beginning at the first ATG codon predicted a protein of 406 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 47,672 Da with five potentialN-linked glycosylation sites. Hydropathic analysis (28Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar) of the predicted amino acid sequence of the presumptive sulfotransferase revealed that it had a prominent type II membrane protein hydrophobic segment in the amino-terminal region, 18 residues in length at positions 48–65 (Figs. 1 and 2). Comparison of the sequence of this human presumptive sulfotransferase with CHO cell heparan sulfate IdceA 2-sulfotransferase (GenBankTM accession number D88811) (15Kobayashi M. Habuchi H. Yoneda M.

In particular, extensive homology existed across 210-amino acid residues from 114 to 320 for a consensus sequence in the middle region of these enzymes, which included the 5′-phosphosulfate binding motif, its catalytic Lys, and 3′-phosphate binding motif corresponding to the reports of new algorithms using PAPS on substrates (29Kakuta Y.

Extracts from cells infected with recombinant viral stocks containing the bacmid-presumptive 2-sulfotransferase showed (TableI) incorporation of [35S]sulfate from 5′-phospho[35S]sulfate into dermatan sulfate, with lesser incorporation into dermatan and chondroitin sulfate, and no incorporation into chondroitin. There was also no net incorporation into CDSNS-heparin by this cell extract over that incorporated by control cell extract which contained significant endogenous heparan sulfate sulfotransferase activity. Cells infected with recombinant viral stocks containing the bacmid-heparan sulfate IdceA 2-sulfotransferase showed net incorporation of sulfate only into CDSNS-heparin, with none into dermatan sulfate, dermatan, or chondroitin sulfate.

Human MTN Blot membrane analysis (Fig.4 A) demonstrated a major band of 5.1 kb and a minor band of 2.0 kb for human tissues. Analysis with the human cancer cell line MTN Blot (Fig. 4 B) showed the same two bands except with promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 and chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562. Burkitt's lymphoma Raji cell line showed the greatest expression. For this reason the cDNA library of this lymphoma cell line was chosen as the cDNA source to isolate the present gene. 35S-Labeled dermatan/chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans were digested with chondroitin ABC lyase alone and with chondroitin ABC lyase immediately followed by disaccharide 2-sulfatase, 4-sulfatase, or 6-sulfatase.

The death domain, death effector domain, and caspase recruitment domain (CARD) are examples of such interaction motifs. We have identified a novel mammalian CARD-containing adaptor molecule termed mE10 (mammalian E10). The N-terminal CARD of mE10 exhibits significant homology (47% identity and 64% similarity) to the CARD of a gene from Equine Herpesvirus type 2. The C-terminal region is unique. Overexpression of mE10 in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells induces apoptosis. Mutational analysis indicates that CARD-mediated mE10 oligomerization is essential for killing activity. The C terminus of mE10 bound to the zymogen form of caspase-9 and promoted its processing to the active dimeric species. Taken together, these data suggest a model where autoproteolytic activation of pro-caspase-9 is mediated by mE10-induced oligomerization.

Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). This is reflected in the fact that, except for CED-4, multiple homologs of each of the core components are found in mammals. Worm CED-4 and its mammalian homolog Apaf-1 function to promote the autoproteolytic activation of downstream effector death proteases termed caspases (3Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D.

Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteine proteases related to worm CED-3 that cleave substrates following an Asp residue (5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). They exist as single polypeptide zymogens composed of a prodomain and a large and a small catalytic subunits. The zymogen is proteolytically processed to the active dimeric species by either an upstream caspase or through an autoproteolytic mechanism. This latter mode of activation is dependent upon the zymogen possessing residual enzymatic activity. Additionally, it is greatly facilitated by adaptor molecules that bind zymogen, effectively increasing its local concentration and subsequent rate of proteolytic processing. Caspases can be classified into upstream initiator caspases and downstream effector caspases. Effector caspases are cleaved and activated by upstream initiator caspases. Initiator caspases, on the other hand, are activated by an autoproteolytic mechanism and dependent upon adaptor mediated induced proximity. For example, caspase-8, the initiator caspase for CD-95 receptor induced apoptosis, is complexed by the adaptor molecule FADD/MORT-1 (6Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5114) Google Scholar), whereas caspase-9, the initiator caspase for mitochondrial-induced death, is oligomerized by the adaptor molecule Apaf-1 in a cytochrome c-dependent manner (7Li P.

Therefore, a recurring theme in the activation of initiator caspases is adaptor molecule-induced oligomerization (8Mengartner M. Science. 1998; 281: 1298-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction of caspases with adaptor molecules is mediated by a homophilic association of structurally related protein modules. Based on sequence similarity, three such interaction motifs have been defined: the death domain, the death effector domain (9Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4537) Google Scholar), and the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) (10Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar).1 All contain a conserved stretch of about 90 amino acids in length. Despite marginal primary sequence similarities, structural studies suggest that these domains adopt a similar fold composed of six α-helices (11Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 12Eberstadt M. Huang B. Chen Z. Meadows R.P. Ng S.C. Zheng L. Lenardo M.J. Fesik S.W.

Cell. 1998; 94: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).The CARD motif is found in many molecules involved in apoptotic signaling (10Hofmann K. Bucher P. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 155-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For example, it is present at the N terminus of Apaf-1 and mediates binding to the corresponding domain within caspase-9 (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar). Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel CARD-containing molecule designated mE10 that, like Apaf-1, interacts with caspase-9. Unexpectedly, however, the CARD motif within mE10 was found not to mediate binding to caspase-9 but rather induced mE10 self-oligomerization. The non-CARD C terminus of mE10 complexed with caspase-9 and promoted its processing to the active protease. Therefore, the data support a model where mE10 induces apoptosis by activation of caspase-9 through an induced proximity mechanism. The core components of the death pathway as revealed by genetic analysis of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans are remarkably conserved through evolution (1Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) although to a much greater degree of complexity in mammals (2Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4780) Google Scholar). This is reflected in the fact that, except for CED-4, multiple homologs of each of the core components are found in mammals. Worm CED-4 and its mammalian homolog Apaf-1 function to promote the autoproteolytic activation of downstream effector death proteases termed caspases (3Yang X. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Science. 1998; 281: 1355-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 4Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Caspases are cysteine proteases related to worm CED-3 that cleave substrates following an Asp residue (5Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6133) Google Scholar). They exist as single polypeptide zymogens composed of a prodomain and a large and a small catalytic subunits. The zymogen is proteolytically processed to the active dimeric species by either an upstream caspase or through an autoproteolytic mechanism. This latter mode of activation is dependent upon the zymogen possessing residual enzymatic activity. Additionally, it is greatly facilitated by adaptor molecules that bind zymogen, effectively increasing its local concentration and subsequent rate of proteolytic processing. Caspases can be classified into upstream initiator caspases and downstream effector caspases. Effector caspases are cleaved and activated by upstream initiator caspases. Initiator caspases, on the other hand, are activated by an autoproteolytic mechanism and dependent upon adaptor mediated induced proximity. For example, caspase-8, the initiator caspase for CD-95 receptor induced apoptosis, is complexed by the adaptor molecule FADD/MORT-1 (6Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5114) Google Scholar), whereas caspase-9, the initiator caspase for mitochondrial-induced death, is oligomerized by the adaptor molecule Apaf-1 in a cytochrome c-dependent manner (7Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6183) Google Scholar).

All five UGTs contain a putative transmembrane domain at their C terminus as is the case for vertebrate UGTs where it is required for enzymatic activity. The primary sequence of the C terminus, including part of the transmembrane domain, differs between the two families but is highly conserved not only within each Drosophila family, but also between the members of one of the Drosophila families and vertebrate UGTs. The partial overlap of the conserved primary sequence with the transmembrane domain suggests that this part of the protein is involved in specific interactions occurring at the membrane surface.

Extensive studies of detoxification in the vertebrate liver provide a framework to the study of detoxification mechanisms in other systems (1Tephly T.R. Burchell B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 276-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 2Brierley C.H. Burchell B. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 3Meyer U.A. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1996; 24: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Detoxification often occurs in two phases; in phase I, the initial compound is transformed into a more reactive species. A variety of different chemical transformations are involved, including redox reactions catalyzed by enzymes of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (4Nebert D.W. Gonzalez F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 945-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (1416) Google Scholar, 5Guengerich F.P. Sci. Am. 1993; 81: 440-447Google Scholar) and members of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR)1 family (6Maser E. Opperman U.C.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Phase II reactions consist in the addition, either to a product of a phase I reaction or directly to many toxic chemicals, of a highly polar group such as UDP-glucuronosyl (catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases) (2Brierley C.H. Burchell B. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or glutathione (catalyzed by glutathione S-transferases (7Shen H. Kauvar L. Tew K.D. Oncol. Res. 1997; 9: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar). Products of phase II reactions are hydrophilic; they can no longer cross membranes and are eliminated by secretion. In addition to the elimination of environmental toxins, phase I and II biotransformation enzymes participate in the removal of toxic side products of normal metabolism (e.g. bile acids), participate in drug clearance, and play an important role in the synthesis of hormones such as prostaglandins and some steroids (3Meyer U.A. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1996; 24: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Finally, the involvement of these enzymes in the production of carcinogens (8Nebert D.W. McKinnon R.A. Puga A. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), drug clearance, and some hereditary diseases (9Owens I.S. Ritter J.K. Yeatman M.T. Chen F. J. Pharmacokinet. Biopharm. 1996; 24: 491-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) makes an understanding of their function important for human health. Biotransformation enzymes related to those found in vertebrates have also been found in insects and are likely to play equally important roles. Cytochrome P450s and glutathione S-transferases in particular have been implicated in insect resistance to pesticides (10Feyereisen R. Toxicol. Lett. (Shannon). 1995; 82: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). UDP-glucuronosyltransferases are part of a superfamily of UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) present in plants, animals, and bacteria (11Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournet-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). These enzymes transfer the sugar moiety of UDP-glucose, UDP-glucuronic acid, UDP-galactose, or UDP-xylose to a variety of hydrophobic substrates (11Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournet-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Insects contain UGT activities that can use UDP-glucose but not UDP-glucuronic acid as a glycosyl donor (12Dutton G.J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1962; 7: 39-46Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 13Ahmad S.A. Hopkins T.L. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 21: 207-224Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Rausel C. Llorca J. Real M.D. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1997; 34: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although no molecular information on any insect UGT was available until this work, baculoviruses infecting several species of moths have been shown to encode ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferases (15O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Science. 1989; 245: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 16Hu Z.H. Broer R. Westerlaken J. Martens J.W.M. Jin F. Jehle J.A. Wang L.M. Vlak J.M. Virus Res. 1997; 47: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These viral enzymes specifically inactivate ecdysteroids, the molting hormones of the infected hosts, and thus prolong the larval stage permissive to viral replication. ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferases lack a C-terminal transmembrane domain and are secreted in the hemolymph where ecdysone is present (15O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Science. 1989; 245: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Here we report that, in Drosophila, several phase I and II biotransformation enzymes are expressed preferentially in the olfactory organs, the antennae. This observation is reminiscent of the preferential or exclusive expression of a cytochrome P450, UGT, and glutathione S-transferase in the vertebrate olfactory epithelium (17Lazard D. Tal N. Rubinstein M. Khen M. Lancet D. Zupko K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7433-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Lazard D. Zupko K. Poria Y. Nef P. Lazarovits J. Horn S. Khen M. Lancet D.

The presence of these enzymes in the olfactory organs of such evolutionarily distant organisms supports the notion that they play an important role in olfaction. In addition, the availability of the first sequences of UGTs from insects sheds light on the structure and function of the C-terminal domain of vertebrate UGTs. Partial cDNA clones for AntP450,AntDH, and DmeUgt35b were initially found through random sequencing of clones in an antennae-minus-heads subtracted cDNA library that was described previously (21Pikielny C.W. Hasan G. Rouyer F. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 39-45Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (311) Google Scholar). All cDNA sequences discussed in this paper were obtained from full-length cDNA clones isolated by using the partial clones as probes to screen an appendage cDNA library in Lambda-ZAP (Stratagene). Appendage RNA was generated from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from an appendage fraction (see below and Ref. 22Oliver D.V. Philips J.P. Drosophila Information Service. 1970; 45: 58Google Scholar). Total RNA for Northern blots was isolated either from hand-dissected antennae or legs or from mass-produced body fractions generated as follows(22). Frozen flies are vortexed, and the resulting body parts are then sieved to yield three fractions: appendages (antennae, legs, and wings), heads (without antennae), and bodies (abdomen and thorax, decapitated and without legs or wings). Because all the proteins under study belong to multigene families, the probes used were first tested on Southern blots under identical conditions to ensure that there was no detectable cross-reactivity to related genes (not shown). The probes used are indicated in the legend to Fig. 1. Sequences were assembled and analyzed using Wisconsin Package Version 9.1, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI. Data base searches were performed using BLAST (23Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60524) Google Scholar) both on the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and National Center for Biotechnology Information www servers (http://www.fruitfly.org/blast/andhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/BLAST/nph-newblast?Jform=0, respectively). The central portion of the DmeUgt35a cDNA is represented by nucleotides number 1–324 of P1 clone DS07339 that has been mapped by the BDGP to 86D5–10. Similarly, the 3′ end of DmeUgt35bis partially represented in preliminary sequence (nucleotides 1–326) of DS08785 mapped to 86D1-D2. AntP450 is a partial cDNA sequence identical to EST number GH06928 and with significant sequence similarity to the C terminus of the cyp6 family of cytochrome P450s (24Cohen M.B. Koener J.F. Feyereisen R. Gene. 1994; 146: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The three members of the DmeUgt37 family result from conceptual translation of sequences from the DrosophilaGenome Project. The sequences encoding the three open reading frames (ORFs) are present at nucleotides number 68193 to 66570 (reverse strand) of P1 clone DS51087 for DmeUgt37a1; positions 22203–22207 of DS00108 for DmeUgt37b1 and nucleotides 111614 to 113188 of DS07321 for DmeUgt37c1. To generate theDmeUgt37a1 ORF, we removed a likely intron at positions 67516–67464. In the case of DmeUgt37b1*, deletion of a single T in a stretch of 5 Ts at positions 22203–22207 results in the creation of an ORF with high similarity to the otherDrosophila UGT37 ORFs (see text). The frameshift in the database sequence could be caused by a sequencing error or a recent mutation resulting in a pseudogene. In either case, conceptual translation of the “corrected” DmeUgt37b1* sequence represents a UGT with high similarity to the other UGT37 proteins throughout its open reading frame and therefore likely represents a real UGT, even if it no longer exists in present day laboratory canton S strains. For the purpose of this publication we will keep the asterisk to denote the ambiguity. Note that the inclusion of theDmeUgt37b1* ORF is not necessary to reach the conclusions about the domain structure of Drosophila UGTs that are discussed in the text. The sequences of the three novel cDNAs discussed here have been deposited in the GenBankTM data base and their accession numbers are as follows: AntDH,AF116553; DmeUgt35a, AF116555; and Dme Ugt35b, AF116554. Non-Drosophila UGTs are designated according to the names given by the UGT Nomenclature Committee and accession numbers are given in the figures. We have previously described a subtracted cDNA library (antennae-minus-heads) enriched in cDNAs expressed specifically or preferentially in the antennae of Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of a number of those cDNAs led to the discovery of several putative odorant-binding proteins with distinct expression patterns on the surface of the antennae, suggesting a role for odorant-binding proteins in olfactory discrimination (21Pikielny C.W. Hasan G. Rouyer F. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 39-45Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Here we report that, in addition to odorant-binding proteins, sampling of our library has led to the discovery of cDNAs coding for a cytochrome P450 (AntP450, see “Experimental Procedures”), a UGT (Dme Ugt35b, see below for explanation of the nomenclature), and a short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (AntDH). The proteins encoded by these three cDNAs are related to vertebrate enzymes involved in detoxification. In addition to DmeUgt35b isolated from our subtractive library, a second UGT-encoding cDNA (DmeUgt35a) was isolated from an appendage cDNA library by cross-hybridization to DmeUgt35b (see below). Analysis of expression patterns was performed by Northern blots using probes specific for DmeUgt35a, DmeUgt35b,AntDH, and AntP450. In every case the probes were generated from sequences that show little similarity with other genes of the same family and the lack of cross-hybridization was verified on Southern blots performed under identical hybridization conditions (data not shown). The Northern blot shown in Fig.1 analyzes RNAs prepared from two types of samples as indicated above the lanes. First, fly parts were separated into three fractions (see “Experimental Procedures”): appendages (third antennal segments, legs, and wings), heads (without third antennal segments), and bodies (decapitated and without legs). Second, to differentiate between different appendages, we separately hand-collected third antennal segments and legs from approximately 200 flies. Expression of AntDH is restricted to appendages, and within appendages it is much higher in third antennal segments than in legs. AntP450 and DmeUgt35b are more ubiquitous because they are detected in heads and bodies albeit at slightly lower levels than in appendages. Nevertheless, both genes are expressed at highest levels in the third antennal segment. In contrast to these three genes, DmeUgt35a shows lower expression in the third antennal segment than in legs. Although most sensilla involved in taste can be found on the legs, head, and wings of Drosophila, the third antennal segment contains the vast majority of olfactory sensilla (25Stocker R.F. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 275: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The preferential expression of AntDH,DmeUgt35b, and AntP450 in the third antennal segment is therefore suggestive of a role in olfaction. To further delineate expression patterns we used in situhybridization on cryosections of heads and antennae (Fig.2). Of the genes discussed here, onlyAntDH expression was detected by this method, most likely because of its higher expression levels (data not shown). Consistent with the Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization toAntDH mRNA is restricted to the third antennal segment; no expression is detected in the head (Fig. 2) or in the second antennal segment (not shown). This observation further supports a role for AntDH in olfaction, because the second antennal segment does not contain chemosensory hairs (25Stocker R.F. Cell Tissue Res. 1994; 275: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Within the third antennal segment however, AntDH expression appears uniformly distributed (Fig. 2 and data not shown), in contrast with several odorant-binding proteins, each of which is restricted to a single morphological type of sensillum with a nonuniform distribution on the antennal surface (21Pikielny C.W. Hasan G. Rouyer F. Rosbash M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 39-45Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 26McKenna M.P. Hekmat-Scafe D.S. Gaines P. Carlson J.R. J. Biol.

Shanbhag, A. Dubin, G. Hasan, Q. Wang, P. Yu, G. Harris, A. Steinbrecht, and C. W. Pikielny, manuscript in preparation. The initial AntDHcDNA clone was used as a probe to isolate a full-length cDNA clone from an appendage cDNA library (see “Experimental Procedures”). A single ORF has sequence similarity to the members of a large family of SDRs (Fig. 3) (28Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar) found in organisms ranging from prokaryotes and plants to humans (28Jornvall H. Persson B. Krook M. Atrian S. Gonzalez-Duarte R. Jeffery J. Ghosh D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6003-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). The overall degree of sequence identity is relatively low as is typical in this family of proteins (the closest sequence we have found is aldehyde reductase from the bacterium Streptomyces clavuligerus, Cla9_Sc in Fig. 3, which has 36% identity with AntDH). However, AntDH has all the residues that have been demonstrated to be important for the function of SDRs (Fig. 3). In particular, the GlyXXXGlyXGly motif close to the amino terminus corresponds to a coenzyme binding pocket for either NAD or NADP. In addition, the TyrXXXLys motif necessary for catalysis can be found at positions 164 through 168 and Ser144 is the likely homologue of the essential Ser139 of alcohol dehydrogenase (29Cols N. Atrian S. Benach J. Ladenstein R. Gonzalez-Duarte R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although most SDRs are cytoplasmic, some members of this family are microsomal or even extracellular (30Lee B.-K. Lee K. Mendez J. Shimkets L.J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2964-2973Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Contrary to the case of the membrane-associated mouse corticosteroid 11-β-dehydrogenase (dhi1_mouse in Fig. 3) there is no apparent amino-terminal signal sequence in the AntDH ORF. Because the short sequence preceding the apparent translational start in our AntDH clone does not contain any stop codon, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that we are missing some 5′ sequences that code for a signal peptide. However, the presence of an AUG at the almost identical position as it is found in many cytoplasmic SDRs (Fig. 3) suggests that we have identified the correct amino terminus and that AntDH is a cytoplasmic protein. When probing the appendage library with our partial Ugt clone we found two classes of clones that hybridize at different intensities. Southern blotting and sequence analysis shows that these phages correspond to two different cDNAs each encoded by a separate gene, which we will call DmeUgt35a and -b (see the last paragraph under “Results” for a justification of this nomenclature). We have mapped both sequences by in situ hybridization to cytogenetic locations 86C-D in the Drosophila genome, suggesting that these two genes have their origin in a relatively recent duplication. More recently, the Berkeley and EuropeanDrosophila genome projects have sequenced parts of bothDmeUgt35 genes, refining the mapping to 86D5-10 and 86D1-2 for the a and b genes, respectively. We have also found that several other likely Ugt sequences are present in the Drosophila genome project data. These include three genomic DNA sequences containing full-length ORFs that define three members of a second family of Drosophila UGTs, UGT37: DmeUgt37a1, -b1 and -c1 (see below for an explanation of the nomenclature). Five other likely Ugtgenes are represented by partial cDNA sequences or ESTs (EST numbers GH06505, GH09393, GM04645, LD25345, and LD15335). The first four are 5′ sequences coding for NH2 termini (Fig.4 A), whereas the last one is a 3′ sequence coding for a C terminus (Fig.5). In all, we describe nine or ten putative Drosophila UGTs (because each of the above ESTs has only been sequenced from one end, LD15335 may be identical to one of the other clones). The two DmeUgt35 cDNAs as well as the three genomic DmeUgt37 sequences appear to represent complete ORFs because they begin with ATG codons and end with stop codons at positions that match closely those expected for this family of genes (see “Experimental Procedures” for further discussion of DNA sequence analysis). In contrast to the use of alternative splicing for the generation of diversity, as is the case of the humanUGT1A1 gene (2Brierley C.H. Burchell B. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we have found no evidence of alternative mRNA splicing, and an intron is present in only one of the three genomic sequences (see “Experimental Procedures”).Figure 5Drosophila UGT35a and -b have C-terminal domains similar to those of vertebrate UGTs but different from those ofDrosophila UGT37a1, -b1 and -c1. Vertebrate UGTs (UGT1A1, UGT2A1, and UGT8) can be aligned with all fiveDrosophila UGTs (indicated by arrowheads) up to a point where the sequences of the two families diverge dramatically. The three alignments were generated independently using Pileup, but the sequences shown are contiguous and their order within the alignments has been preserved and does not correspond to similarity scores.Boxed residues indicate identities in five of eight, three of five, and two of three for the left, top, and bottom alignments, respectively. The transmembrane domain indicated for members of the UGT35 family and its vertebrate relatives is the one proposed for vertebrate UGT2B1 (36Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6119-6125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydropathy calculations for members of bothDrosophila families are consistent with the prediction that the transmembrane domains start immediately after the LD sequence (data not shown). Hydropathy was calculated by the Kyte and Doolittle method using the peptides structure program of Genetics Computer Group. See the legend to Fig. 4 for UGT nomenclature and accession numbers.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Some of the highest similarity between the five complete ORFs is found near a sequence present in all known UGTs and defined by the string: [FVA]-[LIVMF]-[TS]-[HQ]-[SGAC]-G-X(2)-[STG]-X(2)-[DE]-X(6)-P-[LIVMFA]-[LIVMFA]-X(2)-P-[LMVFIQ]-X(2)-[DE]-Q, in which all amino acids that can occur at a given position are listed inside brackets (11Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournet-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). The presence of this sequence strongly supports the identification of these five proteins as UGTs (Fig. 4 B). In addition, the five complete ORFs contain C-terminal hydrophobic domains followed by several basic residues (see below and Fig. 5). In the case of vertebrate UGTs, similar sequences have been identified as a transmembrane domain and a positively charged “stop-transfer” sequence that in combination are responsible for the anchoring of the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (1Tephly T.R. Burchell B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 276-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and are necessary for enzymatic activity (31Meech R. Yogalingam G. Mackenzie P.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Baculovirus ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferases, which are soluble and secreted in the hemolymph of the hosts lack such C-terminal transmembrane domains (15O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Science. 1989; 245: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Finally, at least nine of the ten putative Drosophila UGTs display a region of high similarity at their very amino terminus, immediately following the signal peptides (32von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 537-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1541) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). In the case of the tenth putative UGT: LD15335 only the C-terminal sequence is presently known. In vertebrate UGTs this region of the molecule is involved in the formation of dimers (34Meech R. MacKenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26913-26917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which may be the active form of the protein. In at least one case a heterodimer has enzymatic activities that differ from those of either homodimer (35Ikushiro S. Emi Y. Iyanagi T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7154-7161Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that the combinatorial association of different subunits into heterodimers may provide added functional diversity. In consultation with the UGT nomenclature committee (11Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournet-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), we have assigned the two cDNAs we have cloned to a single family, Ugt35. The other three full-length sequences found through the genome projects fall into a second family,DmeUgt37. Both families fit the commonly accepted criteria for protein families (more than 45% overall identity within a family and less than 45% between different families, data not shown). Finally, although the C-terminal sequence of LD15335 suggests that it is a member of the DmeUgt37 family (Fig. 5), the definitive assignment of the five UGTs presently only known as ESTs (Fig.4 A) to one of these two families, or yet new ones, will require their complete sequences. Amino acid residues present in all nine Drosophila proteins occur in the first sixty residues (Fig. 4 A) as well as in the C-terminal half of the protein, particularly around the signature sequence (Fig. 4 B). After the first sixty amino acids, the amino-terminal halves of the proteins are highly divergent (not shown), as is the case for vertebrate UGTs, perhaps corresponding to different substrate specificities. Strikingly, although the C-terminal halves of all theDrosophila proteins are closely related, there is a strong discontinuity of this similarity at their very C termini. After a highly conserved segment, the sequences of the two families diverge abruptly, each encoding a different C-terminal domain containing putative transmembrane stretches and stop-transfer sequences (Fig. 5). Within each family, however, there is a high degree of sequence conservation. Interestingly, the region of sequence similarity overlaps with the likely transmembrane helix for members of the UGT35 (36Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6119-6125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as UGT37 families (Fig. 5). Five of the first six amino acids in the putative transmembrane domain are identical betweenDrosophila UGT35b and human UGT1A1, and conservation of similarly located residues is apparent for the UGT37 family. This pattern of conservation suggests specific and different roles for the C-terminal domains of the two Drosophila families. The results presented here suggest that, as in the olfactory epithelium of vertebrates (17Lazard D. Tal N. Rubinstein M. Khen M. Lancet D. Zupko K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7433-7440Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18Lazard D. Zupko K. Poria Y. Nef P. Lazarovits J. Horn S. Khen M. Lancet D. Nature. 1991; 349: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 19Dear T.N. Campbell K. Rabbitts T.H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10376-10382Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 20Ben-Arie N. Khen M. Lancet D. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), several biodegradation enzymes are expressed specifically or at higher levels in the antennae ofDrosophila. This conserved expression of biodegradation enzymes in olfactory organs argues for an important function in olfaction. Such a role is also consistent with the presence in the antennae of an enzyme involved in cytochrome P450 activation, NADPH P450 oxidoreductase (37Hovemann B.T. Sehlmeyer F. Malz J. Gene. 1997; 189: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In a highly specialized case of olfactory behavior, male moths are able to find females located many miles away by rapidly alternating between two types of behavior, upwind flight when inside a pheromone plume and casting from side to side as soon as the pheromone is no longer detected (38Baker T.C. Vogt R.G. J. Exp. Biol. 1988; 137: 29-38PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to monitor concentration changes without a lag requires that the half-life of odorants inside the olfactory organs be short relative to the time course of the outside fluctuations. Based on these considerations, researchers have looked for and found enzymes that can specifically metabolize pheromones in the antennae of several species of moths (39Vogt R.G. Riddiford L.M. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 40Rybczynski R. Vogt R.G. Lerner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19712-19715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrate olfaction, a similar role has been attributed to biotransformation enzymes that are better known for their role in detoxification in the liver. The same sequence of events that eliminates toxic chemicals may be involved in odorant degradation, thereby preventing continuing stimulation of olfactory receptors. Consistent with this hypothesis, an olfactory-specific UGT, UGTolf, modifies odorants more efficiently than liver UGTs (18Lazard D. Zupko K. Poria Y. Nef P. Lazarovits J. Horn S. Khen M. Lancet D. Nature. 1991; 349: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A second function for these enzymes might be in the protection of olfactory organs from environmental toxins to which they are, by necessity, preferentially exposed. Although odorant turnover and toxin degradation are not mutually exclusive functions and any given protein may be involved in both, the expression pattern of each gene may suggest the relative contribution to either function. Because detoxification occurs in many organs, proteins whose expression is highly specific to the antennae, such as AntDH and UGT35b, are likely to be involved in odorant turnover. On the other hand, proteins that have more ubiquitous expression patterns, such as UGT35a, may participate primarily in detoxification. We report here that the Drosophila genome encodes at least nine different UGTs. The five genes for which complete coding sequences are available contain the signature motif characteristic of this superfamily and thus represent the first reported UGTs from any insect other than ecdysteroid UDP-glucosyltransferases from baculoviruses (11Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournet-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). In addition to the overall similarity to UGTs in a variety of organisms, bothDrosophila and vertebrate proteins have at their C terminus a transmembrane domain followed by a stop-transfer sequence composed of several positively charged amino acids (1Tephly T.R. Burchell B. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 276-279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 36Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6119-6125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although this domain is absent from viral-encoded ecdysteroid UDP-glucose transferases and some plant UGTs (11Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournet-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar), mutations in either the transmembrane domain or the stop-transfer sequence of vertebrate UGT2B1 eliminate and reduce its activity, respectively (31Meech R. Yogalingam G. Mackenzie P.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More surprising, however, is the high degree of primary sequence identity between the Drosophila members of the UGT35 family and vertebrate sequences in a stretch immediately NH2-terminal to and partially overlapping with the putative transmembrane domain (61 and 70% identity to the human UGT1A1 gene over a 31 amino acid stretch for the a and bgenes, respectively). In addition, although the sequences of members of the UGT37 family are very different from those of the UGT35 family in this region, they are also highly conserved within this second family (Fig. 5). This parallel conservation of primary sequences suggests that the C-terminal domains of UGTs are involved in specific interactions at the membrane surface that differ between UGT35a, -b and the vertebrate enzymes on one hand and the members of the UGT37 family on the other. Despite these differences, the domains of the two classes of proteins have some shared features. In all cases except for UGT37b1*, the two amino acids at positions 15 and 16 after the start of sequence divergence are LD, which are immediately followed by a series of hydrophobic residues likely to be part of the transmembrane domain (Ref. 36Mackenzie P.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6119-6125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 5). In the case of UGT37b1*, a three amino acid insertion moves LD to positions 18 and 19 and the putative transmembrane domain starts at position 20. These similarities suggest that despite the divergent sequences the two different types of C-terminal domains have similar secondary structures and may therefore interact with related proteins. What is the function of these alternative C-terminal domains? The primary sequence conservation within each family suggests it may be involved in an interaction with another protein that occurs at least in part within the membrane. The enzymatic reactions catalyzed by UGTs take place in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and are therefore dependent on specific transporters that allow entry of nucleotides into this subcellular compartment (41Bossuyt X. Blanckaert N. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One intriguing possibility is that the C-terminal domain of UGTs participates in interactions with specific transporters, perhaps corresponding to the specificities of these enzymes for different glycosyl donors. However, because permeabilization of membranes with detergent does not restore activity to proteins with mutations in the C-terminal domain (31Meech R. Yogalingam G. Mackenzie P.I. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 489-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), substrate transport cannot be its only function. Although scans of the existing data bases have not revealed any UGT from any organism with a C-terminal domain similar to that of the UGT37 family, the ongoing sequence of the human genome may yet uncover such genes. Alternatively, if this domain arose after the divergence of the ancestors of insects and vertebrates, it may constitute an insect-specific domain and therefore a possible target for rational pesticide design. The availability of the genes coding for all these enzymes inDrosophila should allow the test of their involvement in olfaction as well as a dissection of the function of the UGT C-terminal domains using both biochemical and reverse genetic approaches. We thank Yashi Ahmed and Ren-Ping Zhou for helpful comments on the manuscript and express gratitude also to Michael Rosbash in whose laboratory this work was initiated."

Research into the mechanisms of toxicity and possible therapeutic intervention is therefore essential. In this study, the response of transgenic mice overexpressing human antioxidant enzymes to acute acetaminophen overdose was investigated. Animals overexpressing superoxide dismutase or plasma glutathione peroxidase demonstrated dramatic resistance to acetaminophen toxicity. Intravenous injection of glutathione peroxidase provided normal mice with nearly complete protection against a lethal dose of acetaminophen. Surprisingly, animals overexpressing intracellular glutathione peroxidase in the liver were significantly more sensitive to acetaminophen toxicity compared with nontransgenic littermates. This sensitivity appears to be due to the inability of these animals to efficiently recover glutathione depleted as a result of acetaminophen metabolism. Finally, the results suggest that glutathione peroxidase overexpression modulates the synthesis of several acetaminophen metabolites.

Although generally considered a safe drug, it continues to be a cause of death either through overdose, idiopathic reaction, or synergism with alcoholic liver disease. Death from acetaminophen overdose is thought to be secondary to liver failure, which is caused by massive hepatic necrosis, the hallmark pathological feature of acetaminophen toxicity. In addition to liver, however, many organ systems may fail under acute overdose such as renal, cardiac, and central nervous systems (1Thomas S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 60: 91-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is thought that the liver is the target organ for acetaminophen toxicity because this is primarily where the drug is detoxified. Under normal conditions, acetaminophen is mainly metabolized by undergoing sulfation and glucuronidation (2Jollow D.J. Thorgeirsson S.S. Potter W.Z. Hashimoto M. Mitchell D.J. Pharmacology. 1974; 12: 251-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a small amount of drug goes through the cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidase system and is metabolized into the reactive intermediateN-acetyl-P-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI),1 which is in turn detoxified by reaction with glutathione (3Mohandas J. Duggin G.G. Horvath J.S. Tiller D.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1981; 61: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 4Rosen G.M. Ranckman E.J. Ellington S.P. Dahlin D.C. Christie V. Nelson S.D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 25: 151-157PubMed Google Scholar). When large quantities of acetaminophen are consumed, the three detoxification pathways become saturated. The precise mechanism by which acetaminophen causes cell death remains unknown, although there are two prevailing theories that are controversial today. The first theory, the oxidative stress theory, maintains that acetaminophen metabolites cause oxidative stress in the cell ultimately leading to its demise. The second theory, the covalent binding theory, states that the binding of the highly reactive acetaminophen metabolites to cell macromolecules causes cell death. There is much evidence to substantiate both theories, and the question may be to what extent each plays a role in acetaminophen toxicity (5Gibson J.D. Pumford N.R. Samokyszyn V.M. Hinson J.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 580-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The depletion of cellular glutathione, a natural antioxidant, leaves the cell particularly vulnerable to oxidative insults following acetaminophen overdose. The oxidative stress theory has gained increased recognition as a result of a number of studies, which indirectly and directly demonstrate the presence of reactive oxygen species in cells following acetaminophen administration. Several antioxidants have been shown to protect against acetaminophen toxicity such as β-carotene (6Baranowitz S.A. Maderson P.F.A. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1994; 65: 1175-1180Google Scholar) and α-tocopherol (7Amimoto T. Matsura T. Koyama S. Nakanishi T. Yamada K. Kajiyama G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to the studies involving these chemicals, the exogenous administration of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase (8Kyle M.E. Miccadei S. Nakae D. Farber J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 889-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) has been shown to protect dramatically against acetaminophen toxicity. Although it seems clear that oxidative stress plays some role in acetaminophen toxicity, the exact source(s) of the oxidative stress is not known, and the mechanism of the resultant cytotoxicity is also the subject of speculation. We are using transgenic animals overexpressing the human antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, intracellular (GPI) and extracellular (GPP) forms, as well as Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) to investigate their ability to influence acetaminophen toxicity. We report here that GPP and SOD transgenic mice are equally protected against the lethality of an overdose of acetaminophen, whereas GPI transgenic mice showed significantly increased sensitivity to acetaminophen as compared with normal animals. We demonstrate that metabolism of acetaminophen in GPI mice leads to a significant decrease in the replenishment of GSH in liver and blood, in particular, in comparison with the other animal groups. In contrast, GPP mice were able to sustain an elevated level of GSH during acetaminophen intoxication. The results also indicate that GP overexpression influences the synthesis of several oxidized acetaminophen metabolites. Transgenic mice with human GP or Cu,Zn-SOD genes were produced as described previously (9Mirochnitchenko O. Palnitkar U. Philbert M. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8120-8124Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 10Mirochnitchenko O. Inouye M. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1578-1586PubMed Google Scholar). Normal and transgenic animals for the experiments were obtained by breeding heterozygous transgenic founders with C57BL/6 × CBA/J F1 mice. SOD and GPI transgenic mice show increased activities of Cu,Zn-SOD and GPI, respectively, in most of the tissues, as reported earlier. For example Cu,Zn-SOD activity in liver of SOD mice is 2.2-fold higher, whereas activity of GP in liver of GPI mice is 1.3-fold higher than that of nontransgenic mice (11Nakatani T. Inouye M. Mirochnitchenko O. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 236: 137-146Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GPP mice have 50% increased activity of GP in blood plasma, and the same activity in liver as nontransgenic mice. Animals were maintained with 12 h light/dark cycling at 25 °C and fed ad libitum. Nontransgenic littermates were used as controls. Experimental animals were matched for age and gender. Experimental protocol has been approved by the University of Medicine and Dentistry Animal Care and Use Committee. Lactate dehydrogenase and alanine aminotransferase were measured in plasma samples using an assay kit (Sigma) according to the kit's protocol. Thin sections were cut by microtome and stained with hemotoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscope. Damage was assessed by expert pathologist on a scale from 0 to 4 based on qualitative and quantitative criteria. For survival studies, 425 mg/kg acetaminophen (Sigma) were injected intraperitoneally from a 15 mg/ml solution in sterile PBS. Animals were followed for 72 h for survival. To evaluate the effect of intravenously administered GP on animal sensitivity to acetaminophen, bovine GPI (Sigma) was dissolved in sterile PBS to a concentration of 500 units/ml and 1.4 milliunits/kg injected into the tail veins of 11 nontransgenic mice. Approximately equal volumes of sterile PBS were injected into tail veins of 10 additional nontransgenic mice. Intravenous injections were followed immediately by intraperitoneal injections of acetaminophen, 350 mg/kg. The dosage was based on a dose response study in males used in this analysis, that are known to be more sensitive to acetaminophen toxicity. Total (GSH + GSSG) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione were measured using the recycling method (12Ravindranath Y. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Tissue was homogenized in 10% perchloric acid and frozen at −70 °C until time of assay. Frozen homogenate was then centrifuged for 20 min at 6,000 × g. Acid supernatant was used for GSH assay, and acid supernatant reacted with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma) and run through Sep-Pak P18 cartridge (Waters) was used for GSSG determination. Reaction mixtures contained 0.15 mm NADPH and assay buffer (0.6 mm 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitro-benzoic acid) in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, and glutathione reductase (80 milliunits/ml)). Plasma was mixed with equal volumes of 5-sulfosalicylic acid for plasma glutathione measurements (10%, w/v) (13Vendemiale G. Guerrieri F. Grattagliano I. Didonna D. Muolo L. Altomare E. Hepatology. 1995; 21: 1450-1454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant assayed using reagents in the above proportions. Tissue lipid peroxidation was assayed using thiobarbituric acid as previously published (14Masugi F. Nakamura T. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1976; 46: 187-191PubMed Google Scholar). 2.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid solution and 1 ml of 0.67% thiobarbituric acid solution were added to 0.5 ml of liver homogenate. The mixtures were incubated at 100 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was extracted with 4 ml of butanol and centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 ×g. Optical density of the upper phase was measured at 532 nm. 1,1,3,3-tetraethoxypropane was used as a standard for malonaldehyde. Quantitative determination of the acetaminophen metabolites in plasma was carried out by a modified high pressure liquid chromatography method as previously published (15Lin M.C. Wang E.J. Patten C. Lee M.J. Xiao F. Reuhl K.R. Yang C.S. J. Biochem. Toxicol. 1996; 11: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fluorescence spectra of NAPQI (Sigma) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) and of solutions containing 0.05–0.5 mm acetaminophen, 36 mm cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, 0.2–1 mmH2O2, 1–10 units of GPI (Sigma) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.7) were recorded on a Perkin Elmer spectrofluorometer using λexc 306 nm as reported by Schmitt and Cilento (16Schmitt K. Cilento G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). H2O2 was added last and the fluorescence emission (360–560 nm) was monitored at 5 min intervals. The ability of GP to stimulate NADPH oxidation by acetaminophen in the presence of H2O2 was determined as described by Kelleret al. (17Keller R.J. Hinson J.A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 184-187PubMed Google Scholar). The absorbance of the reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.38 mm EDTA, 0.12 mm NADPH, 0.1–5 units of GPI (Sigma) and 0.1–10 mm H2O2 was continuously monitored at 340 nm. Acetaminophen was added at final concentrations of 0.01–1 mm. All results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical differences between means were evaluated using the Student's t test. Transgenic mice overexpressing SOD, GPI, GPP, and nontransgenic controls received 425 mg/kg acetaminophen intraperitoneally in a single dose. SOD mice were dramatically protected from toxicity, with 25% mortality as compared with 75% mortality in nontransgenic controls (Fig.1 A). Similar protection has been reported for exogenous administration of liposome-encapsulated SOD to rats immediately before acute acetaminophen overdose (18Nakae D. Yamamoto K. Yoshiji H. Kinugasa T. Maruyama H. Farber J.L. Konishi Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 787-795PubMed Google Scholar). Animals overexpressing extracellular GP in the blood also demonstrated dramatic protection against acetaminophen, again suffering only 25% mortality. Surprisingly, animals overexpressing GP in the liver tissue itself displayed a completely opposite phenotype-enhancement of acetaminophen toxicity. All GPI animals receiving acetaminophen died within 5.5 h of treatment. Control mortality was only 75% and occurred over a more extended period of time, with the last death occurring at 36 h post-injection. The behavior of the animals corresponded to survival pattern, with more sensitive animals feeding poorly and displaying less spontaneous locomotor activity. To confirm that the response of the GPP transgenic mice was caused by increased GP activity in the blood, 1.4 milliunits/kg GP was injected into tail veins of 11 nontransgenic mice and equal volumes of PBS into tail veins of 10 additional animals, immediately before an intraperitoneal injection of a lethal dose of acetaminophen. The dose of GP was selected because it achieves roughly the same activity of GP in the blood as is normally found in GPP transgenic mice. Almost 90% of GP-injected animals survived beyond 72 h, whereas none of the PBS-injected animals survived beyond 6 h (Fig. 1 B). Increased GP activity in the blood appears to be responsible for the reduced mortality seen in both GP-injected as well as GPP transgenic mice. By histopathologic criteria there were no differences between groups at 4 h, with all animals sustaining equally severe damage. At 8 h, histopathology generally agreed with survival data, with SOD and GPP animals displaying less damage than controls and GPI displaying more severe damage (Fig. 2). Liver necrosis was also evaluated by measurement of blood alanine aminotransferase activity. Levels of alanine aminotransferase at 8 h were as follows: 5,477 ± 2,035 units/liter, 802 ± 465 units/liter and 3,119 ± 1,594 units/liter for GPI, GPP, and nontransgenic mice, respectively; baseline alanine aminotransferase values were the same in all groups and equal to 21 ± 1.3 units/liter for nontreated mice. Data obtained indicate that GPI mice had the highest increase in alanine aminotransferase, whereas GPP mice had the smallest elevation of alanine aminotransferase compared with nontransgenic mice. Hepatic glutathione has a well established pattern of depletion and recovery under conditions of acetaminophen overdose. All animal groups suffered approximately 95% depletion of total GSH at 1 h, as seen in Fig. 3 A. At 8 h, when total GSH content returned to baseline in all other groups, GPI mice had significantly lower total GSH than SOD, controls, and GPP mice (37, 32, and 26% lower, respectively). This difference might indicate the inability of GPI mice to efficiently replenish liver GSH, leading to an increase of the sensitivity of these animals to acetaminophen toxicity. However, we could not exclude another possibility that the effect observed in GPI mice might be the result of earlier necrosis developed in these animals, because liver damage in GPI mice was higher than in all other groups at this time point. Interestingly, a comparison of liver GSH content among the different groups reveals a significantly lower proportion of GSH (higher proportion of GSSG) in SOD mice relative to all other groups at 1 h (Fig. 3 B). Because GPP animals overexpress the plasma form of GP, plasma levels of total glutathione were measured to determine the degree of oxidative stress in the blood. Similar to what was observed in the liver, total glutathione in the plasma of SOD, GPI, and control animals was almost completely depleted by 1 h (Fig.3 C). In contrast to the liver, however, plasma glutathione levels at 4 h remained low in all groups, except for GPP, in which clear tendencies for recovery were observed. By 8 h, levels of plasma glutathione in SOD and GPP animals returned to baseline, whereas control animals were still at 73% and GPI at 60% of baseline levels. Significantly, although depleted from baseline levels, plasma total GSH was substantially higher in GPP animals than in all other groups at 1 and 4 h and higher than both GPI and controls at 8 h. Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measurement of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). After 4 h, TBARS were elevated in all groups (Fig. 3 D), but after 8 h, they returned to baseline, except for SOD mice. The significant increases in lipid peroxidation in the livers of SOD mice following an overdose of acetaminophen are most likely the result of increased production of H2O2. This observation correlates with the decreased GSH content in these animals compared with nontransgenic and GP mice at earlier time points. Importantly, we did not observe the expected decrease in hepatic lipid peroxidation in GP transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic animals following acetaminophen administration. These data indicate absence of correlation between survival of different group of animals and the level of liver lipid peroxidation as well as inability of both types of GPs to decrease the level of liver peroxidation measured as TBARS. The data are consistent with a number of studies that have found a dissociation between lipid peroxidation and acetaminophen toxicity (19Vermeulen N.P. Bessems J.G. Van de Straat R. Drug Met. Rev. 1992; 24: 367-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Altered metabolism of acetaminophen in the presence of an increased level of GP may explain the seemingly paradoxical response of GPI transgenic mice. For example, acetaminophen has been reported to be oxidized to NAPQI during peroxidative metabolism of horseradish peroxidase (20Potter D.W. Hinson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 966-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mammalian lactoperoxidase (21Mason R.P. Fischer V. Fed. Proc. 1986; 45: 2493-2499PubMed Google Scholar), thyroid peroxidase (22Nakamura M. Yamazaki I. Katani T. Ohtaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12909-12913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and prostaglandin H synthase (23Pirmohamed M. Madden S. Park B.K. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 1996; 31: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Acetaminophen metabolism was evaluated by measurements of specific metabolites in the serum of animals following administration of acetaminophen. Overall there are significant similarities in the patterns of changes of acetaminophen metabolites in all animals tested (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the concentration of free acetaminophen was somewhat higher in the serum of GPP mice at 30 min, and the concentration of acetaminophen-glucuronide and mercapturate were lower in GPP mice at 50 min compared with normal and GPI mice (Fig. 4, A, B, and F). Furthermore, the concentrations of the mercapturic acid metabolites of acetaminophen were much higher in GPI animals at 25–60 min concomitantly with a lower concentration of acetaminophen-GSH. These data indicate that GP overexpression influences the level of several acetaminophen metabolites. The rate of acetaminophen oxidation by cytochrome P450 in liver microsomal fractions from normal and GPI mice was the same (data not shown). Based on the above results, it was hypothesized that intracellular GP could use acetaminophen as electron donor, thus converting acetaminophen to acetaminophen free radical. The latter could be reduced back to acetaminophen by a variety of processes, including potentially toxic reactions such as abstracting hydrogen atoms from critical cellular molecules. This process in liver overexpressing GPI might lead to the increase in toxicity and exacerbation of damage in transgenic mice. To test this hypothesis, we exposed acetaminophen to the purified intracellular glutathione peroxidase in the presence and absence of H2O2. Two approaches were used to test the ability of GPI to form NAPQI from acetaminophen. In the first series of experiments, a mixture of acetaminophen and GPI was treated with H2O2, and NAPQI formation was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 5 A, commercially available NAPQI exhibits readily detectable fluorescence emission with a maximum at 440–450 nm using 306 nm as the excitation wavelength (16Schmitt K. Cilento G. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Prolonged exposure of acetaminophen to H2O2 leads to the appearance of a similar, but weaker fluorescence emission, probably reflecting autooxidation of the drug (Fig. 5 B). Addition of 0.1–10 units of GPI to the reaction mixture did not increase but decreased the spontaneous oxidation (Fig. 5 C). Though we do not know the exact reason for this effect at present, GPI at least was not able to augment NAPQI formation as other peroxidases. In a second indirect approach, GP activity was analyzed by following oxidation of NADPH to NADP in the presence of acetaminophen and H2O2 according to the method of Keller and Hinson (17Keller R.J. Hinson J.A. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 184-187PubMed Google Scholar). We did not observe any effect of acetaminophen (0.01 to 1 mm) on the rate of NADPH oxidation. Acetaminophen toxicity is one of many human disease processes widely believed to involve reactive oxygen species. The success in using various antioxidants to protect against acetaminophen toxicity is important not only for its therapeutic application but because it may shed light on the mechanism of hepatotoxicity. Because of the severity and high costs of poor clinical outcomes of acetaminophen poisoning and because acetaminophen may serve as a model for other diseases involving oxidative stress, research into mechanisms of toxicity and candidates for therapeutic intervention is quite important. GP is a critical antioxidant enzyme for the detoxification of peroxides. Its particular kinetics and relatively low substrate specificity makes it a very efficient reducer of peroxides (24Toussaint O. Houbion A. Remacle J. Toxicol. 1993; 81: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), far more so than catalase, which is the other enzyme that detoxifies H2O2. The importance of GP has been shown in many studies including several that demonstrate marked protection against oxidative damage in cells by overexpression of GP through transfection (25Ozdemirler G. Aykac G. Uysal M. Oz H.J. J. Appl. Toxicol. 1994; 14: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Yagi K. Komura S. Kojima H. Sun Q. Nagata N. Ohishi N. Nishikimi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GP has been largely overlooked despite its promise as a candidate for therapeutics in diseases involving oxidative stress, in favor of studies involving SOD, the enzyme which converts O·̄2 into H2O2. One of the current prevailing theories regarding the toxicity of acetaminophen maintains that increased oxidative stress in the liver is a critical factor in acetaminophen-induced injury. As both SOD and GP are antioxidant enzymes that reduce oxidative stress, we were interested in the effects of overexpression of these enzymes on hepatocellular damage and mortality as compared with one another and to controls. Because acetaminophen is transported to the liver through the blood and post-detoxification events are unclear and may also involve secretion of by-products into the blood, we were also interested in the effects of overexpression of the plasma form of GP on acetaminophen toxicity. Overexpression of the plasma form of GP and of intracellular SOD are equally protective against a lethal overdose of acetaminophen. That SOD is protective, both in this and a previous study (29.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar), implicates the superoxide anion in the mechanism of acetaminophen toxicity. Indeed, O·̄2 was found to be increased more than 2-fold in mouse liver microsomes following a large dose of acetaminophen in the studies of Lores Arnaiz et al. (27Lores Arnaiz S. Llesuy S. Cutrin J.C. Boveris A. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1995; 19: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The enhanced sensitivity of GPI transgenic mice to acetaminophen toxicity was an unexpected finding in our study. Intracellular overexpression of GPI, which is able to detoxify the final products of oxidative stress and is significantly more efficient in protecting cells in vitro against reactive oxygen species than SOD and catalase (28Michiels C. Raes M. Toussaint O. Remacle J. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), would be expected to confer protection on the animals. Nevertheless, overexpression of GPI was unable to protect against liver damage, and moreover, significantly increased mortality of animals. The explanation of this effect most likely lies in a unique situation, i.e. depletion of the important intracellular antioxidant GSH by the antioxidant defense enzyme GPI, an action that compounds GSH depletion by acetaminophen metabolites and reactive oxygen species and could account for the slow recovery of GSH in GPI mice. We did not observe any difference in GSH depletion even at a short period of time, such as 5, 10, and 30 min after acetaminophen administration (data not shown). There were significant differences in GSH recovery in the liver and blood in GPI mice compared with all other groups of mice at a later time point. Importantly, this time period (4–8 h) correlates with the highest lipid peroxidation, which requires active antioxidant enzymatic activity for detoxification. Insufficient amounts of intracellular GSH might explain why the level of lipid peroxidation in the liver was not affected by GPI overexpression as well. The protection of GPP animals is surprising in view of the traditional belief that the major target organ of acetaminophen toxicity is liver and that metabolism and thus toxic by-products would be localized there. Several possibilities may contribute to acetaminophen resistance in GPP animals. First, toxic metabolites of acetaminophen and/or peroxides may be released from the liver into the blood and these are efficiently detoxified by the increased plasma levels of GP. Circulation of toxic metabolites could explain why, in some cases of acetaminophen toxicity, organs besides the liver and kidney are affected (sometimes even in the absence of severe hepatic necrosis) (31Bjornstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility is that secondary factors following acetaminophen toxicity are influenced by overexpression of plasma GP. For example, overexpression of extracellular GP can protect against damage by increased scavenging of the released reactive oxygen species as well as by inhibition of activation of inflammatory leukocytes, which play an important role in acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (30Goldin R.D. Ratnayaka I.D. Breach C.S. Brown I.N. Wickramasinghe S.N J. Pathol. 1996; 179: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). An additional important factor could be related to the difference in electron donors utilized by GPP and GPI. It was recently shown that GPP, in contrast to GPI, uses thioredoxin and glutaredoxin significantly more efficiently than GSH (31Bjornstedt M. Xue J. Huang W. Akesson B. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29382-29384Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, GPP mice were able to detoxify blood reactive oxygen species under conditions of severe oxidative stress caused by scavenging of GSH. On the other hand, increased levels of lipid peroxides will not lead to increased GSH oxidation by elevated levels of GPP. Indeed, GPP animals showed the least depletion of glutathione in the plasma (Fig. 3 C) and thus were experiencing less oxidative stress in blood than any of the other three groups. Details of the critical role of GSH presence in extracellular pools, including blood, in detoxification and protection against chemical and oxidant-induced injuries are described in a recent review by Smith et al. (32Smith C.V. Jones D.P. Guenthner T.M. Lash L.H. Lauterburg B.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 140: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In summary, SOD and GPP transgenic mice demonstrated marked resistance to acetaminophen overdose. In contrast, GPI animals showed significantly increased sensitivity to acetaminophen as compared with controls. These animals had a delay in restoration of the level of glutathione, whereas GPP mice were characterized by least depletion and most efficient restoration. Our study indicates that the phenotype may be independent of lipid peroxidation with regard to acetaminophen toxicity, consistent with a number of studies that have found no correlation between toxicity and lipid peroxidation (24Toussaint O. Houbion A. Remacle J. Toxicol. 1993; 81: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Increased toxicity most likely does not involve elevated peroxidative activity of GPI using acetaminophen as cofactor, because this enzyme was not able to form NAPQI from acetaminophen in vitro. At this point we do not know the mechanism by which GPs were able to affect the profile of oxidized acetaminophen metabolites, especially mercapturate. The blood levels of these metabolites are the result of several processes that might be affected by the level of GP expression. Our data also suggest that in addition to hepatocellular damage, which has been the accepted hallmark feature of acetaminophen toxicity, events in the blood are also crucial for organismal well being and survival in the condition of an acetaminophen overdose. This finding may have important implications for therapeutic intervention in patients suffering from acetaminophen toxicity. We thank Dr. G. Witz for valuable discussion of the findings and assistance with the fluorescence studies. We also thank Dr. H. Jaeschke for helpful comments."

The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases has been implicated in several integrin-mediated events including focal adhesion formation, cell spreading, cell migration, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. However, the mechanism by which PKC regulates integrin function is not known. To characterize the role of PKC family kinases in mediating integrin-induced signaling, we monitored the effects of PKC inhibition on fibronectin-induced signaling events in Cos7 cells using pharmacological and genetic approaches. We found that inhibition of classical and novel isoforms of PKC by down-regulation with 12-0-tetradeconoyl-phorbol-13-acetate or overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of PKC significantly reduced extracellular regulated kinase 2 (Erk2) activation by fibronectin receptors in Cos7 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active PKCα, PKCδ, or PKCε was sufficient to rescue 12-0-tetradeconoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-mediated down-regulation of Erk2 activation, and all three of these PKC isoforms were activated following adhesion. PKC was required for maximal activation of mitogen-activated kinase kinase 1, Raf-1, and Ras, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, and Shc association with Grb2. PKC inhibition does not appear to have a generalized effect on integrin signaling, because it does not block integrin-induced focal adhesion kinase or paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. These results indicate that PKC activity enhances Erk2 activation in response to fibronectin by stimulating the Erk/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway at an early step upstream of Shc.

Multiple intracellular signaling molecules are stimulated following integrin-dependent adhesion, some of which require assembly of these actin complexes for activation. Integrin targeted signaling molecules include members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 signaling pathways, Rho family GTPases, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src, and members of the lipid signaling pathways such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K), and protein kinase C (PKC) (reviewed in Refs. 1Schlaepfer D.D. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 151-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar and 2Aplin A.E. Howe A. Alahari S.K. Juliano R.L. Pharmacol Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). How ligand binding to integrins activates these signaling events and how activation of the different molecules mediates integrin functions is still poorly understood. The protein kinase C family of serine/threonine kinases can be classified into three major subgroups (3Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar). The classical PKCs consist of PKCα, βI, βII, and γ, which are Ca2+/lipid-dependent kinases. The novel PKCs, PKCδ, ε, η, and θ are Ca2+-independent but require lipid for activation. The third class, atypical PKCs, consists of PKCζ and ι/λ, which are neither Ca2+- nor lipid-dependent. Finally, PKCμ, although similar to novel PKCs, contains a membrane-spanning domain and is often placed in a separate class. PKCs are activated in cells following stimulation with a wide variety of agonists, including growth factors, antigens, cytokines, and neurotransmitters. In addition, phorbol esters such as 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) are direct stimulators of classical and novel PKCs. Acute treatment with TPA causes translocation of classical and novel PKCs from the cytosol to the membrane, an event that is necessary for activation of at least some PKC members. However, prolonged treatment with TPA results in degradation and loss of expression of some TPA-responsive PKCs. PKC has been shown to play an important role in cell-regulated events such as secretion, differentiation, tumorigenesis, mitogenesis, signal transduction (3Blobe G.C. Stribling S. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Cancer Surveys. 1996; 27: 213-248PubMed Google Scholar), intracellular transport (4Ktistakis N.T.

Kelleher D. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Several in vivo PKC targets have been identified; the best characterized being the 80-kDa phosphoprotein MARCKS (7Blackshear P.J. J. Biol.

In addition to MARCKS, other cytoskeletal proteins such as pleckstrin, talin, vinculin, annexins, α- and γ-adducin, Src suppressed protein kinase C substrate, and paxillin are potential PKC substrates in vivo (6Keenan C.

First, treatment of many different cell types with TPA causes increased adhesion, spreading, and migration of cells on extracellular matrices (19Huang X. Wu J. Spong S. Sheppard D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2189-2195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Defilippi P. Venturino M. Gulino D. Duperray A. Boquet P. Fiorentini C. Volpe G. Palmieri M. Silengo L. Tarone G. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 309-316PubMed Google Scholar), FAK phosphorylation (24Haimovich B. Kaneshiki N. Ji P. Blood. 1996; 87: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J.

Second, several PKC isoforms have been implicated in adhesion-dependent events. PKCα and PKCδ are associated with focal adhesions (27Jaken S. Leach K. Klauck T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 28Barry S.T. Critchley D.R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2033-2045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and PKCα and PKCε translocate to the membrane following integrin activation (29Haller H. Lindschau C. Maasch C. Olthoff H. Kurscheid D.

Third, integrin engagement leads to increased phospholipase C (PLC) activity, increased diacylglycerol levels, and arachidonic acid production, pathways involved in PKC activation (21Chun J. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 29Haller H. Lindschau C. Maasch C. Olthoff H. Kurscheid D. Luft F.C. Circ.

Although the specific PKC isoforms involved in integrin-mediated events are beginning to be defined, how PKCs regulate integrin-induced signaling events and what their targets are have not been fully explored. To characterize the role of PKC in integrin-dependent signaling, we monitored the effects of inhibiting PKC on fibronectin-induced signaling events in Cos7 cells using pharmacological and molecular genetic approaches. Down-regulating classical and novel PKC isoforms with TPA or over-expression of dominant-negative mutants of PKC in Cos7 cells did not block integrin-induced FAK or paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation; however, fibronectin-induced Erk2 activation was significantly reduced. Inhibition of PKC also greatly reduced fibronectin-induced MEK1, Raf-1, and Ras activation as well as Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and Grb2 association. These results indicate that fibronectin-induced PKC activation plays a role in modulating the MAPK pathway by regulating early events upstream of Shc. Cos7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 units penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. For adhesion assays, tissue culture plates were coated with 5 μg/ml fibronectin (Collaborative Biomedical) in PBS overnight at 4 °C and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin prior to use. Near confluent plates of cells were serum starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized in 0.01% trypsin containing 5 mm EDTA for 5 min at 37 °C. Trypsinization was terminated with 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Life Technologies, Inc.) in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. Cells were collected, washed in PBS/5 mm EDTA, resuspended in serum free DMEM, and held in suspension at 37 °C for at least 30 min. Cells were either left in suspension or placed on fibronectin-coated plates at a density of 3–4 × 106 cells/10-cm plate for various times. TPA (Calbiochem) at 25–100 ng/ml was added to plates 18–24 h before plating on fibronectin. Suspension cells were lysed in 2× lysis buffer as defined below and diluted with 1× buffer when necessary. Adherent cells were washed once with DMEM prior to lysis to remove nonadherent cells and lysed in 1× lysis buffer on the plate.

The regulatory domain truncation mutant of PKCδ (pSRD-PKCδ RD) encodes the N-terminal region of mouse PKCδ from amino acid residues 1–298 connected to C-terminal amino acids 655–674. The regulatory domain truncation mutant PKCε (pSRDHis-PKCε RD) encodes the N-terminal region of rabbit PKCε from amino acid residues 1–385 and is tagged with His6/T710 tag at the N terminus. The kinase domain truncation mutant of mouse PKCδ (pSRD-PKCδ KD) encodes amino acid residues 348–674 and is preceded by Met.

The kinase domain truncation mutant of rabbit PKCα (pSRD-PKCα KD) encodes amino acid residues 298–672. Cos7 cells were transfected at 2 × 106 cells/10-cm plate with 8–10 μg of total DNA using the LipofectAMINE procedure as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, cells were used in adhesion assays as described above. Erk2, MEK1, and Raf-1 kinase assays were performed as described previously (36Reuter C.W. Catling A.D. Weber M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J.

Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Blue Reagent (Bio-Rad). Erk2, MEK1, and Raf-1 substrates were 0.25 mg/ml myelin basic protein (Life Technologies, Inc.), 30 μg/ml kinase dead GST-MAPK (Upstate Biochemical), and 12.5 μg/ml kinase dead GST-MEK1 (Upstate Biochemical), respectively. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 15–30 min and terminated with 40 μl of 2× SDS Sample buffer by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad), and after autoradiography and quantitation by phosphoimaging (Fuji) blots were subjected to immunoblotting for the respective kinases. Cells adherent to fibronectin or left in suspension were lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 158 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton-X, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin), passed through a 25ga needle, and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations (IP) were incubated for 2–4 h at 4 °C with protein A-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce) to capture the complexes. All IP were washed three times with RIPA, resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed by immunoblotting. After blocking in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and incubating with primary antibody, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). Blots were stripped in 2% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, rinsed extensively, and reprobed as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were lysed in hypotonic cytosolic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 units/ml aprotinin) for 20 min on ice after washing with PBS. Cells were collected and broken open by Dounce homogenization. The soluble cytosolic fraction (S30) was collected after centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pellets (P30) were further fractionated into membrane and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions by solubilizing in cytosolic buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. The soluble membrane fraction (P30Mem) was recovered after centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The Triton X-100-insoluble pellets were resuspended in RIPA, and supernatants (P30Ins) were collected after centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The ratio of total cytosolic protein:membrane protein:Triton-insoluble was calculated, and that ratio was maintained when extracts were loaded onto SDS gels. Both soluble and insoluble membrane extracts were pooled for immunoprecipitation of PKCδ from membrane fractions. The amount of GTP bound to Ras was measured according to the protocol of Vaillancourt et al.(38Vaillancourt R.R. Harwood A.E. Winitz S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which was modified as described by Zheng et al. (39Zheng L. Sjolander A. Eckerdal J. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Briefly, confluent, serum starved cells were washed with phosphate-free DMEM and incubated with 0.25 mCi of32PO4/plate for 4–5 h. Cells were washed, trypsinized, and placed in suspension as described above, except that TBS was substituted for PBS. Suspended cells were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM and 1 mCi/ml 32PO4 for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were plated onto fibronectin coated plates for 20–30 min, until cells were adherent and beginning to spread. Plated cells were washed with PBS, lysed, processed, and immunoprecipitated as described (39Zheng L. Sjolander A. Eckerdal J. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8431-8436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). GTP/GDP was eluted from the Ras immunoprecipitates with 25 μl 0.75 mKH2PO4 (pH 3.4) at 68 °C for 10 min. TLC was carried out on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates. GTP and GDP unlabeled standards were run in parallel and visualized under UV light. The percentage of GTP bound relative to the ratio of GTP/GDP was quantitated on a Fuji phosphoimaging system. The ability of GTP-Ras to bind the effector region in Raf-1 was monitored as described previously (41Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). As a first step toward defining the role of PKC in fibronectin-induced signaling in Cos7 cells, we examined which PKC isoforms are expressed in Cos7 cells. Immunoblot analysis of Cos7 cell extracts with antibodies specific for eleven different PKC isoforms revealed that Cos7 cells express eight PKC isoforms (Fig. 1 A): classical PKCα, PKCβI, and PKCβII, novel PKCδ and PKCε, atypical PKCζ and PKCλ as well as PKCμ. Prolonged treatment of cells with TPA results in degradation and loss of expression of TPA-responsive PKCs, effectively resulting in a cell that is null for those PKCs. Of the PKC isoforms in Cos7 cells, only PKCα, β, δ, and ε should be affected by prolonged TPA exposure. Treatment of Cos7 cells for 24 h with 100 ng/ml TPA eliminated PKCα, βI, and δ but only reduced PKCε by 70% as monitored by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates (Fig. 1 B). Higher doses or longer TPA treatment did not further reduce PKCε levels (data not shown). As expected, atypical PKC isoforms and PKCμ were unaffected by long term TPA treatment. Plating cells on fibronectin did not change the level of PKC expression either before or after TPA-mediated down-regulation (Fig. 1 B). The best characterized mechanism leading to in vivo activation of classical and novel PKCs following receptor stimulation involves an increase in intracellular diacylglycerol levels, which is mediated by PLC isozymes (42Nakamura S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The observations that PLCs translocate to integrin complexes and that adhesion of epithelial cells to collagen induces PLCγ activation through β1 integrin indicate that activation of PLC may be important for integrin signaling events (31Banno Y. Nakashima S. Ohzawa M. Nozawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14989-14994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 32Cybulsky A.V. Carbonetto S. Cyr M. McTavish A.J. Huang Q.

Cell. 1995; 6: 1349-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). To determine whether PLCγ can be activated by fibronectin in Cos7 cells, PLCγ1 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts following adhesion of Cos7 cells to fibronectin, and the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation were monitored by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, because tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 activates it. Plating cells on fibronectin resulted in a rapid increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 (Fig. 2 A). No tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 was detected in suspension cells. Thus adhesion of Cos7 cells to fibronectin activates PLCγ1, which could lead to activation of PKC through diacylglycerol production. TPA-responsive PKCs translocate from the cytosolic fraction into detergent-soluble membrane fractions during activation. To determine whether adhesion of Cos7 cells to fibronectin causes an increase in membrane-associated PKCs, cells were subjected to biochemical fractionation as outlined under “Experimental Procedures.” Cells were fractionated into cytosolic (S30) and membrane fractions (P30). The membrane fraction was further fractionated into Triton X-100-soluble (P30Mem) and Triton X-100-insoluble (P30Ins) fractions, and each was analyzed by immunoblotting with different PKC isoform antibodies. Adhesion to fibronectin resulted in translocation of a small fraction of PKCα and PKCβI to the soluble membrane fraction, both of which were predominately cytosolic in suspension cells (Fig.2 B). A corresponding increase in soluble membrane-associated PKC kinase activity was also observed (data not shown). Unlike PKCβI, PKCβII was found to be primarily in the P30 pellet and fractionated equally between the soluble membrane and detergent-insoluble fraction in suspension cells. This distribution did not change following adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 2 B). Approximately a third of total PKCε was associated with the P30 pellet in suspension cells. Following adhesion to fibronectin a small but reproducible increase in the amount of PKCε in the soluble membrane fraction (P30Mem) occurred concurrently with a reduction in mobility (Fig. 2 B). Like PKCε, approximately a third of the total PKCδ was found in the P30 pellet, but PKCδ distribution did not change following adhesion. Growth factors and TPA have been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCδ (44Li W. Mischak H. Yu J. Wang L. Mushinski J.F. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2349-2352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Li W. Yu J. Michieli P. Beeler J.F. Ellmore N. Heidaran M.A. Pierce J.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6727-6735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion of Cos7 cells to fibronectin also resulted in inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane-associated PKCδ, as seen by immunoprecipitation of PKCδ and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.2 C). Thus adhesion of Cos7 cells to fibronectin induces activation of PLCγ1, membrane association of PKCα, βI, and ε, and tyrosine phosphorylation of membrane-associated PKCδ. TPA-induced PKC down-regulation did not adversely affect the ability of Cos7 cells to adhere to fibronectin (Fig.3 A). However, prolonged TPA treatment did result in delayed spreading on fibronectin (Fig.3 B). Spreading in untreated cells could be seen as early as 10 min after plating on fibronectin (60%), but TPA-treated cells were poorly spread at 10 min (5%). By 45 min TPA-treated cells had reached the same level of spreading as untreated cells at 10 min (58%). At 60 min after plating only 64% of the TPA-treated cells had spread compared with 90% for untreated cells. Thus inhibition of PKC function in Cos7 cells by long term TPA treatment affects cell spreading but not cell adhesion. We next investigated which integrin-induced downstream signaling events are affected by loss of novel or classical PKC isoform function. Adhesion to extracellular matrices induces tyrosine phosphorylation of two focal adhesion-associated proteins, FAK and paxillin (46Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). To determine whether inhibition of PKC affects fibronectin-induced FAK or paxillin phosphorylation, FAK and paxillin were immunoprecipitated from cells plated on fibronectin for various times and probed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Adhesion to fibronectin induced robust tyrosine phosphorylation of both FAK and paxillin (Fig.4 A, P-tyr blot). TPA-induced PKC down-regulation did not block fibronectin-induced FAK or paxillin phosphorylation, although it did reduce tyrosine phosphorylation at very early (10 min) stages of cell adhesion. Previous studies demonstrated that inhibition of PKC blocked integrin-induced FAK phosphorylation (22Lewis J.M. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21459-21462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because TPA-induced PKC down-regulation did not completely inhibit PKCε expression, we examined the effect of inhibiting PKCε on integrin-induced FAK phosphorylation. Either of the two dominant-negative mutants of PKCε (PKCε K− or PKCε RD) was co-expressed with HA-tagged FAK, and the ability of fibronectin to induce FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was monitored. The PKCε mutants were expressed at levels greater than 10-fold over endogenous levels (Fig. 4 B,PKC blot) as determined by immunoblotting of whole cell extracts with PKCε antibody. The kinase inactive PKCε mutant (PKCε K−) and the regulatory domain of PKCε (PKCε RD) have previously been shown to act as a dominant-negative mutants (14Cai H. Smola U. Wixler V. Eisenmann-Tappe I.

Biochemical and genetic evidence has demonstrated that activation of a prototypical MAPK occurs through sequential activation of a series of upstream kinases: a serine/threonine MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates a dual specificity protein kinase (MAPKK or MKK or MEK) that in turn phosphorylates and activates a MAPK. Three groups of mammalian MAPKs and the upstream kinases and stimuli that activate them have been studied most extensively. These include the p42/p44MAPKs (extracellular signal-regulated kinases, ERK1 and ERK2), that are generally activated by mitogens and differentiation inducing stimuli, the p46/p54SAPKs (stress-activated protein kinases, SAPKs), and the p38MAPKs. Stress-activated protein kinases were discovered as the principal c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases and therefore have also been termed JNKs. Distinct from ERK1 and ERK2, the SAPKs are predominantly activated by cell stress-inducing signals such as heat shock, ultraviolet irradiation, proinflammatory cytokines, hyperosmolarity, ischemia/reperfusion, and axonal injury. Like previously identified MAPK pathways in mammalian cells and yeast, the SAPK pathways were initially thought to lead in a linear fashion from activation of a Rho-like small GTPase through a series of intermediate protein kinases to SAPK activation. However, with the identification of two MAPKKs (MKK4/SEK1, MKK7/JNKK2) many MAPKKKs (four MEKKs, five MLKs, ASK1, Tpl-2, and TAK1) and multiple additional MAPKKK kinases that appear to lie in pathways proximal to the SAPKs, it is clear that the organization, regulation, and function of these protein kinase pathways remain poorly understood. The five identified members of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family share two common structural features (4Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 5Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30808-30817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each has a kinase catalytic domain whose primary structure is hybrid between those found in serine/threonine and tyrosine protein but most closely resemble MAPK kinase kinases. Second, closely juxtaposed COOH-terminal to the catalytic domain, each MLK protein has a domain that is predicted to form two leucine/isoleucine zippers separated by a short spacer region. It has been proposed that all members of the MLK family behave functionally as MAPK kinase kinases in pathways leading to activation of SAPKs (6Hirai S.I. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I.

Despite the common features of the MLK family, the various members of the family are likely to have diverse biological behavior. This is predicted by comparison of structure that shows that MLK1, MLK2, and MLK3 form one closely related MLK subfamily while DLK and LZK form a second distinct subfamily (5Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E.

MLK2 and MLK3 have highly conserved kinase catalytic and leucine zipper domains, sharing more than 70% sequence identity. Both possess an SH3 domain in their NH2-terminal region, and both have a functional CRIB domain that mediates GTP-dependent association with Rac1 and Cdc42Hs (9Nagata K.I. Puls A. Futter C.

DLK and LZK share highly conserved kinase catalytic and leucine zipper domains that are more than 90% identical, whereas these domains have only 36% identity to those of MLK2 and MLK3. Given the noted structural differences, DLK and LZK substrates may be distinct from those utilized by MLK2 and MLK3. Indeed, DLK and LZK substrates have not been identified. Moreover, DLK and LZK lack both CRIB motifs and SH3 domains and possess COOH-terminal regions that are structurally distinct from those of MLK2 and 3. These observations predict that protein-protein interactions unique to each protein kinase lead to distinct regulation and function by determining different subcellular compartmentalization and by providing access to different substrates. The studies reported here provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. In vitro and complementary in vivobiochemical studies demonstrated that both DLK and MLK3 directly associate with, phosphorylate, and activate MKK7. Unlike MLK3, however, DLK did not phosphorylate or activate recombinant MKK4 in vitro. To investigate the physiological relevance of these observations, the cellular and subcellular localization of endogenous DLK, MLK3, MKK7, and MKK4 was investigated both in neuron cell culture and in the nervous system. Whereas MLK3 was identified predominantly in the periventricular ependyma and meninges, DLK and MKK7 were predominantly localized in neurons. DLK and MKK7 were identified in similar nuclear and extranuclear compartments. However, MKK4 occupied compartments distinct from that of DLK and MKK7. The dissimilar cellular and subcellular compartmentalization and differential substrate utilization of DLK and MLK3 provide evidence that specific mixed lineage kinases participate in unique signal transduction events. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against the carboxyl-terminal 223 amino acids of DLK (C1) was described previously (5Holzman L.B. Merritt S.E. Fan G. J. Biol.

Primary embryonic cortical neuron culture was established from dissected cortices obtained from Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses at embryonic day 17. Cortical cells were dissociated in Neurobasal Medium containing B-27, GutaMax-I and AlbuMax II (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 × 105 cells/well of a 24-well plate were seeded on glass coverslips precoated with 100 μg/ml poly-d-lysine. Cultures were incubated for 2 weeks at 37 °C in humidified 95% air, 5% CO2. Half of the medium was replaced twice weekly. Cultures were characterized by immunocytochemistry using neuron specific antibodies against neurofilament protein (SMI31, Steinberger Meyer Immunochemicals) and astrocyte-specific antibody, glial fibrillary acidic protein (Sigma).

Recombinant GST-MKK7 and GST-MKK7(KA) were prepared as described by Frangioniet al. (23Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Briefly, following expression in culture, bacterial pellets were washed in 50 ml of ice-cold STE (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA) and resuspended in STE containing 100 μg of lysozyme. After a 15-min incubation on ice, dithiothreitol (5 mm final concentration) and Sarkosyl (1.5% final concentration) were added, and the resultant suspension was pulled several times through a 18-gauge needle. Supernatant obtained following centrifugation of the suspension at 10,000 × g for 5 min was adjusted to contain 4% Triton X-100 and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Fusion proteins were eluted from beads with 10 mm reduced glutathione in a buffer containing 75 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100 and were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon-10 (Amicon, Inc.)

Complexes were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors) containing 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) and 2 μg of GST-c-Jun(1–79). Reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and autoradiographed. Where indicated, incorporated counts were counted with a Bio-Rad phosphorimager. Equivalent expression of transfected p46SAPK was assessed by immunoblotting. DLK and MLK3 immune-complex kinase assays were performed as above except that 2 μg of GST-MKK4, GST-MKK1, GST-MKK3, GST-MKK5, GST-MKK7, or their kinase negative mutants were substituted as substrate were indicated in figure legends. MKK7 immune-complex kinase assays were carried out as above except that 2 μg of GST-SAPK was substituted as substrate. In vitroactivation of SAPK was determined essentially as described (7Fan G.

FLAG epitope-tagged DLK, DLK(K185A), MLK3, or MLK3(K144E) were immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of transiently transfected COS 7 cell lysate. In vitro reconstituted coupled kinase assays were performed by combining indicated MLK immune complexes with either recombinant GST-MKK4 or GST–MKK7 or their kinase negative mutants as indicated in kinase buffer containing 50 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. Recombinant GST-SAPK and GST-c-Jun (1–79)-Sepharose beads were added, and reaction mixes were incubated for an additional 15 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by addition of Laemmli buffer, boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and autoradiographed. FLAG-DLK, FLAG-MLK3, or vector only were expressed and labeled with [35S]methionine in a single reaction reticulocyte lysate-based in vitrotranscription/translation system according to the directions of the manufacturer (Promega). One-tenth of each reaction mix was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with or without 10 μg of GST-MKK7 and 25 μl of glutathione-agarose in a PBST buffer containing phosphate-buffered 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. Beads were washed five times with PBST then eluted in 5 mm reduced glutathione. Eluates were separated on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Gels were fixed, treated with ENHANCE (DuPont), dried, and autoradiographed. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Nervous tissues were removed, washed in cold PBS, and cryoprotected in sucrose prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. Spinal cords were cut in 6-μm sections on a cryostat; 40-μm sections were obtained with a sliding microtome of brain and cerebellum. Free-floating sections of brain and cerebellum were used for immunocytochemistry as described (24Gao B. Hornung J.P. Fritschy J.M. Neuroscience. 1995; 65: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Primary antibody was detected with species-appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG secondary antibodies and developed with nickel enhanced 3,3′-diaminobenzidene tetrahydrochloride using the Vector Elite detection kit (Vector Laboratories). Indirect immunoflourescence studies utilized complementary secondary antibodies conjugated to Cy2 or Cy3 (The Jackson Laboratory) as indicated in the legends to Figs. Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9. In studies of primary cortical neurons in culture, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. After exposure to the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight, the bound antibody was detected using a secondary antibody conjugated to Cy3 or Cy2.Figure 8DLK translocates to the nucleus following truncation of the sciatic nerve in an in vivo model of cellular injury. At indicated times following sciatic nerve axotomy, normal adult rats were perfused fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde by left ventricular puncture. Spinal cord in the region of the lumbar bulge was removed, prepared, and studied by immunoflourescence microscopy. Shown are representative sections of immunoflourescence staining of motor neurons for DLK (A,C, E, G, I, J) and MKK7 (B, D, F, H) in control animals (A, B, I) and at 5 min (C, D), 30 min (E, F), and 24 h (G, H) following axotomy.Arrows emphasize location of nuclei.

A, cerebral cortex was homogenized and cells were subfractionated as described under “Materials and Methods.” Twenty-μg aliquots of nuclear (N), microsomal (M), and cytosolic (C) fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, then immunoblotted as indicated with antibodies directed against DLK, MKK7, MKK4, and phosphorylated MKK4. Fractions were also immunoblotted with antibodies specific for α3 subunit of sodium-potassium ATPase (alpha3), synaptophysin (synapt), and histone 1 to demonstrate suitability of fractionation. In order to demonstrate the purity of the nuclear preparation, an aliquot was stained with DAPI indicating the presence of DNA. Shown is an identical field visualized both by phase (B) and immunoflourescence microscopy (C). Immunoflourescence and confocal microscopy were used to analyze additional aliquots for the presence of DLK (D) and MKK7 (E). Insets represent reconstructions of confocal images in the z plane. Control experiments lacking primary antibody or using primary antibody preadsorbed with a molar excess of appropriate fusion protein failed to stain isolated nuclei (data not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Indirect immunohistochemistry demonstrating localization of DLK, MLK3, and MKK7 in normal adult rat nervous system. DLK (A–D) and MKK7 protein (G–J) co-localized within neurons of the central and peripheral nervous system including those of the cerebral cortex (compare A andG) and cerebellum (B, H). MLK3 protein was identified in the ependyma (E, F) but could not be identified in neurons even by immunoflourescence (F). Note DLK and MKK7 immunoreactivity within dendritic processes and accentuated staining in a perinuclear and nuclear distribution (C, H). Within the neurons of the hippocampus, MKK7 immunoreactivity was most prominent within the neurons of the lower leaflet of the dentate gyrus (I, J), whereas DLK staining was more uniformly distributed (compareD and I, J). Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and their apical dendrites stained intensely for DLK and MKK7 (B, H). Note differences in staining intensity between DLK and MKK7 within the granular cell layer (B, H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The preparation of intact nuclei from adult rat cortex and from primary cortical neurons was carried out by isopycnic banding at the 30–35% Iodoxanol interface, in order to cause the least possible disruption of the nucleoprotein complexes within them, following the manufacturers protocol (OptiPrep). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 175–225 g were anesthetized with chloral hydrate. The sciatic nerve was exposed in the gluteal region and cut. Control rats were anesthetized and the sciatic nerve was exposed but not cut. At 5 min, 30 min, and 1 day after axotomy, animals were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. The spinal cord in the region of the lumbar bulge was removed, washed in cold PBS, cryoprotected in sucrose, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Three animals at each time point were employed. A minimum of three sections per spinal cord were analyzed by immunoflourescence. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that catalytically inactive MKK4 attenuated the ability of DLK to activate p46SAPK when overexpressed in co-transfected COS 7 cells (data not shown and Ref. 6Hirai S.I.

To more closely examine the potential epistatic relationship between DLK and MKK4, the ability of DLK to phosphorylate MKK4 in vitro was investigated. Immunoprecipitated overexpressed DLK, MLK3, or their inactive mutants were incubated with catalytically inactive recombinant GST-MKK4-KR in a buffer containing radiolabeled ATP and magnesium. As reported by others (10Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Contrary to expectation, DLK did not phosphorylate GST-MKK4-KR. In similar experiments, the capacity of immunoprecipitated DLK to phosphorylate in vitro catalytically inactive mutants of GST fusion proteins of MKK1, MKK3, or MKK5 was also tested (Fig.1 B). DLK did not phosphorylate recombinant MKK1, MKK3, or MKK5 in vitro.

Using a combination of pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we show that increases in intracellular cAMP cause a protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the two PDE4D variants expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, namely PDE4D3 and PDE4D5. In addition, we show that stimulation of PKC via the associated activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade results in the phosphorylation and activation of PDE4D3 in these cells. Furthermore, our studies demonstrate that simultaneous activation of both the protein kinase A and PKC-Raf-MEK-ERK pathways allows for a coordinated activation of PDE4D3 and for the translocation of the particulate PDE4D3 to the cytosolic fraction of these cells.

Recently, significant progress has been made in elucidating some of the mechanisms regulating the activity and expression of some of the PDE. In this regard, one family that has received a significant amount of attention has been the cAMP-specific, Rolipram-inhibited PDE4 (2Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L.

In human, rat and mouse, four distinct genes encode PDE4 (PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, andPDE4D), with each, as a result of alternate splicing or the use of alternate promoters, potentially giving rise to multiple enzyme variants. As a result of early work by several laboratories, it has been established that several PDE4 variants can be expressed in individual tissues and that these genes are regulated by transcriptional and/or posttranslational mechanisms (2Bolger G.

Although the cAMP-mediated expression of individual PDE4 genes can be cell type-specific, the generality of this observation and the cellular mechanisms that allow for the selectivity are not known. PDE4 variants are also regulated by protein phosphorylation (reviewed in Ref. 5Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. August T.J. Murad F. Anders M.W. Coyle J.T. Advances in Pharmacology. 44. Academic Press, London1998: 225-342Google Scholar). Thus, a protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation and short-term activation of a specific PDE4 variant, PDE4D3, has been reported (6Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Alvarez R. Sette C. Yang D. Eglen R. Wilhelm R. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol.

Although PKA-mediated phosphorylation was shown to selectively activate a subset of PDE4D3 with high affinity for the inhibitor Rolipram, the molecular basis of this selectivity is unknown at the present time. Phosphorylation of PDE4B2 by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) has also been reported, although this phosphorylation did not alter the enzymes activity or sensitivity to inhibitors (17Lenhard J.K. Kassel D.B. Rocque W.J. Hamacher L. Holmes W.D. Patel I. Hoffman C. Luther M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, expression of PDE4A and PDE4D gene products in heterologous expression systems has shown that certain variants of PDE4A and PDE4D are targeted to selected membrane fractions (Ref. 18Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar and reviewed in Ref. 5Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. August T.J. Murad F. Anders M.W. Coyle J.T. Advances in Pharmacology. 44. Academic Press, London1998: 225-342Google Scholar). The relevance of these findings to the subcellular distribution of PDE4 variants expressed endogenously in nontransformed cells and the impact of selected subcellular expression of these enzymes on their activity and sensitivity to inhibitors have not yet been systematically or rigorously investigated. However, given that targeting of PKA to membrane compartments via specific anchoring proteins (19Scott J.D. Soc. Gen. Physiol. Ser. 1997; 52: 227-239PubMed Google Scholar) has been shown to play a central role on the function of this protein in cells, a similar impact of selective expression of PDE4 variants may perhaps be anticipated. Presumably due to the lack of vasorelaxant effects of PDE4 inhibitor (20Polson J.B. Strada S.J. Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 403-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), very few studies have investigated the PDE4 gene products expressed in vascular tissues and the mechanisms regulating their activity and expression. In a previous study, we demonstrated that prolonged activation of adenylyl cyclase in aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) caused up-regulation of total cAMP PDE activity, with at least 60% of this effect due to increases in PDE4 (15Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Maurice D.H. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 29: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In these earlier studies, we also demonstrated that the cAMP-mediated increase in PDE4 activity was partially responsible for a cAMP-mediated desensitization to activators of adenylyl cyclase in these cells (15Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,16Maurice D.H. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 29: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). More recently, we have reported that PDE4 inhibitors were potent regulators of VSMC migration and could potentiate the effects of inhibitors of other cAMP PDEs on VSMCs (21Palmer D. Tsoi K. Maurice D.H. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a result similar to that previously reported for relaxation of blood vessel (22Komas N. Lugnier C. Stoclet J.-C. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 104: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the role that protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade plays in regulating the activity and subcellular targeting of the PDE4D variants expressed in VSMCs. Using a combination of pharmacological and biochemical approaches, we have delineated the signaling pathways that allow for the coordinated activation of these PDE4D variants by activators of PKC and PKA. Our data are consistent with a direct role for PKA in activating PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 and a role for PKC, via its effects on the Raf-MEK-ERK cascade, in the activation and translocation of the membrane associated fractions of PDE4D3.

ECL Western blot detection kit was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The BCA protein assay kit and bovine serum albumin were from Pierce. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and purchased from Fisher. PDE4D variants expressed in VSMCs were detected using monoclonal antibody 61D10E. This PDE4D-specific monoclonal antibody was purified from mouse ascites by protein A affinity chromatography monoclonal antibody and supplied to us by Cathy Farrell, Sharon Wolda, and Ken Ferguson of ICOS Corporation (Bothell, WA). Activated ERK1 and ERK2 were detected using a monoclonal antibody that specifically reacts with the phosphorylated forms of these proteins (Promega). Primary cultures of rat aortic VSMCs were established following isolation from rat aortae as described previously and the identity of the VSMCs was confirmed using α-actin staining (15Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 16Maurice D.H. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 29: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). VSMCs were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 8 mmHEPES, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 95% air-5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were passaged by washing once with HBSS (without Ca2+ or Mg2+) and then incubating with 1% trypsin-EDTA for 2 min to detach cells and resuspended in growth medium. To maintain cell stocks, 75-cm2 flasks were seeded with 106cells and 20 ml of medium per flask. For all experiments, cells were used between passages 5 and 10. In these experiments, 3 × 105 cells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks, and the experiments were initiated when the cells reached confluence (3–4 days). Culture medium was removed and replaced with 5.0 ml of fresh culture medium supplemented with either (i) forskolin (0.1–100 μm), (ii) PMA (0.1–1 μm), (iii) angiotensin II (1 μm), (iv) ionomycin (1–100 μm), or (v) vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)) and incubated for various times. After treatment, cells were washed once with 6 ml of HBSS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1% Triton X-100. Cells were removed from the flask by scraping. Cellular debris and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. The 1000 × gsupernatant was transferred to microtubes and stored at 4 °C until assayed for cAMP PDE activity (see below). For some experiments, cytosolic and particulate fractions were prepared. In these instances, VSMCs were lysed as described above, except that Triton X-100 was excluded from the lysis buffer, and the 1000 × gsupernatant was subjected to a further centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity was assayed by a modification of the method of Davis and Daly (23Davis C.W. Daly J.W. J. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 5: 65-74PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 100 μl containing 5 μmol of Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 μmol of MgCl2, 10 nmol of EGTA, and 0.1 nmol of [3H]cAMP (55000–60000 dpm). Following a preincubation period of 2 min at 30 °C, a sample of VSMC homogenate (5 μg of protein) was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 50 μl of 0.5m ice-cold EDTA (pH 7.4). Recovery marker (0.1 ml of 5′-[14C]AMP, 1800 dpm) and 0.3 ml of a HEPES-NaCl buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 8.5) was added to each sample prior to purification of the product of the reaction, 5′-[3H]AMP. 5′-[3H]AMP and 5′-[14C]AMP were recovered by chromatography using a polyacrylamide-boronate gel column (Affi-Gel 601, Bio-Rad; bed volume, 1 ml). Samples were applied following prewashing of the columns with 8 ml of HEPES-NaCl buffer. After four additional washes of the columns with 2 ml of HEPES-NaCl and equilibration of the columns with 1 ml of 0.05 m sodium acetate (pH 4.8), the 5′-AMP was eluted with 4 ml of 0.05 m sodium acetate. The recovered 5′-[3H]AMP was quantified by liquid scintillation counting, corrected for recovery of 5′-[14C]AMP, and normalized to the total protein used in the assay, and the total activity was expressed as pmol min−1 mg−1 of protein. Rat aortic VSMC cultures incubated with compounds of interest were homogenized in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Buffer A). These samples (5–20 μg of total homogenate protein or of protein from isolated subcellular fractions) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and the membranes were blocked by incubation with TBST (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) supplemented with 5% powdered nonfat milk for 1 h. Blots were incubated with an appropriate dilution of primary antibodies for 1–2 h and rinsed three times with TBST. Rinsed blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h, then rinsed with TBST, and immunoreactivity was detected by chemiluminescence as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Rat aortic VSMCs were seeded in T75 boxes (Corning) and cultured as described above. At confluence, the growth medium was replaced with phosphate-free minimal essential medium containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml), and cells were incubated for 2 h. During the last 0.5 h of the metabolic labeling, PMA (100 nm), FSK (100 μm), or Me2SO was added. At the end of this treatment, cells were washed twice with HBSS; harvested in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; and homogenized. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min, supernatants were incubated batch-wise for 30 min with DEAE-Sepharose buffered with 200 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5. The resin was washed twice with the same buffer, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with 600 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5. In order to remove nonspecific immunoreactive proteins, the partially purified samples were incubated with 2.5 μg/ml of an irrelevant monoclonal antibody (anti-elastase, mouse IgG2b) for 2 h at 4 °C and then with protein G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min and centrifuged (1000 ×g for 15 min). The supernatant were transferred to fresh vials and incubated with 2.5 μg/ml of the PDE4D-specific monoclonal antibody (61D10E) for 16 h at 4 °C. Again, precipitation was achieved using protein G beads. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times and resuspended in 1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline, diluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were blotted onto an Immobilon membrane, and the radioactive bands were visualized and quantitated with an Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.). Protein was determined using the BCA protein assay system from Pierce, according to the manufacturer's protocol, with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Numerical data (PDE activities) and densitometric determinations of PDE4 phosphorylation status are presented as mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Immunoblots that are shown are representative of results obtained in at least three individual experiments. Statistical differences between cAMP PDE activities were determined using the Student's t test for either paired or unpaired samples, with p < 0.05 considered significant. Incubation of cultured VSMCs with the activator of adenylyl cyclase, forskolin, caused a time- and concentration-dependent increase in cAMP PDE activity (Table I). Similarly, incubation of these cells with PMA or with the vasoactive agent AngII caused time and concentration dependent increases in cAMP PDE activity in these cells, although the absolute magnitude of the increase brought about with these agents was less marked than was obtained with forskolin (TableI). Coincubation of PMA or AngII with forskolin resulted in an additive increase in cAMP PDE activity when compared with the effects of the individual agents used alone (Table I). The inactive analogues of forskolin, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, and PMA, 4α-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate (4αPDD), had no effect on total cAMP PDE activity or on the fraction attributable to PDE4 (not shown). As reported previously, PDE4 activity accounts for approximately 60% of total cAMP PDE activity in these cells (15Rose R.J. Liu H. Palmer D. Maurice D.H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 122: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and based on the effects of selective PDE4 inhibition, increases in this fraction of the total activity accounted for more than 90% of the total increase under our experimental conditions (Table I). The increases in PDE4 activity caused by either forskolin, PMA, or AngII or combinations of these agents were not sensitive to cycloheximide or actinomycin D.Table IIncubation of VSMC with forskolin, PMA, and AngII increases PDE4 activityAdditionscAMP PDEPDE3PDE4ΔPDE4pmol/min/mg%None70.6 ± 1.210.6 ± 1.945.9 ± 0.5Forskolin (1.0 μm)72.9 ± 0.8aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.11.3 ± 1.347.8 ± 0.94Forskolin (10 μm)85.3 ± 2.0aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.14.3 ± 1.156.9 ± 1.8aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.24Forskolin (100 μm)90.1 ± 2.9aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.12.9 ± 2.467.3 ± 2.0aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.47PMA (1.0 nm)71.3 ± 1.010.9 ± 1.446.3 ± 0.91PMA (10 nm)74.3 ± 1.511.3 ± 2.747.9 ± 1.24PMA (100 nm)80.9 ± 1.7aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.9.8 ± 2.051.5 ± 1.7aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.12AngII (10 nm)77.2 ± 0.9aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.11.7 ± 1.349.9 ± 0.8aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.9AngII (100 nm)83.5 ± 1.3aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.14.9 ± 2.253.6 ± 1.1aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.17Forskolin (100 μm) + PMA (100 nm)115.0 ± 2.3aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.14.8 ± 2.074.9 ± 2.1aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.63Forskolin (100 μm) + AngII (100 nm)113.9 ± 2.9aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.13.7 ± 2.884.9 ± 8.8aP < 0.05 in comparison to no addition value.85VSMCs were incubated with forskolin (100 μm), PMA (100 nm), or AngII (100 nm) for 30 min.

Because incubation of VSMCs with forskolin, PMA, or AngII increased PDE4 activity, and cAMP-mediated, PKA-dependent activation of a PDE4 variant (PDE4D3) had previously been reported (6Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Alvarez R. Sette C. Yang D. Eglen R. Wilhelm R. Shelton E.R. Conti M. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), we undertook to determine which PDE4D gene products were expressed in these cells and determine whether phosphorylation of these enzymes was involved in the increased PDE4 activity caused by forskolin, PMA, AngII, or combinations of these compounds. Immunoblot analysis of lysates of VSMCs with a PDE4D-selective monoclonal antibody identified two individual anti-PDE4D immunoreactive species with electrophoretic mobilities by SDS-PAGE characteristic of previously described PDE4D variants (Fig.1). The smaller more abundant PDE4D species migrated with an observed molecular mass of 95 ± 2 kDa by SDS-PAGE, a size similar to that of the human recombinant PDE4D3 (Fig.1). Based on these characteristics, we identified this protein as PDE4D3. The larger, less abundant PDE4 species migrated with an observed molecular mass of 105 ± 3 kDa (Fig. 1), a mobility consistent with PDE4D5 (18Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because this immunoreactive protein was significantly smaller than the other known PDE4D species, PDE4D4, which has been shown to migrate with an observed molecular mass of approximately 119 kDa (18Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.E. Loughney K. Scotland G. Hoffman R. Wilkinson I. Farrell C. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we identified the larger VSMC PDE4D variant as PDE4D5 (5Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. August T.J. Murad F. Anders M.W.

Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Consistent with this identification, polymerase chain reactions carried out using oligo(dT)18-primed VSMC mRNA as a template and PDE4D3- and PDE4D5-specific oligonucleotide primers allows the amplification of both PDE4D3 and PDE4D5 (not shown). When cells were lysed in the absence of detergent, PDE4D3 was found primarily in the supernatant fraction, with approximately 17% present in the 100,000 × g pellets (Fig. 1). In contrast, PDE4D5 was present in both the supernatant and particulate fractions in roughly equal amounts (Fig. 1). Although the amount of PDE4D5 detected in our experiments was variable, it was never present at more than 15% of the level of PDE4D3. The variability in the levels of PDE4D5 detected in our studies may be related to our observation that the fraction of PDE4D5 expressed in the particulate fraction was not efficiently solubilized with Triton X-100, the detergent used in most of our studies (not shown). In most previous reports, phosphorylation of PDE4D3 has been studied by quantitating the fraction of PDE4D3 that exhibited a retarded migration by SDS-PAGE, an event that is detected as an upward shift in the electrophoretic mobility of PDE4D3.

We previously showed that in CHO cells expressing human TPO (hTPO) only 2% of synthesized hTPO reaches the cell surface. Herein, we investigated the role of heme moiety insertion in the exit of hTPO from the endoplasmic reticulum. Peroxidase activity at the cell surface and cell surface expression of hTPO were decreased by ∼30 and ∼80%, respectively, with succinyl acetone, an inhibitor of heme biosynthesis, and were increased by 20% with holotransferrin and aminolevulinic acid, precursors of heme biosynthesis. Results were similar with holotransferrin plus aminolevulinic acid or hemin, but hemin increased cell surface activity more efficiently (+120%) relative to the control. It had been suggested (DePillis, G., Ozaki, S., Kuo, J. M., Maltby, D. A., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (1997)J. Biol.

In our study, heme associated intracellularly with hTPO, and we hypothesized that there was insufficient exposure to H2O2 in Chinese hamster ovary cells before hTPO reached the cell surface. After a 10-min incubation, 10 μm H2O2 led to a 65% increase in cell surface activity. In contrast, in thyroid cells, H2O2 was synthesized at the apical cell surface and allowed covalent attachment of heme. Two-day incubation of primocultures of thyroid cells with catalase led to a 30% decrease in TPO activity at the cell surface. In conclusion, we provide compelling evidence for an essential role of 1) heme incorporation in the intracellular trafficking of hTPO and of 2) H2O2 generated at the apical pole of thyroid cells in the autocatalytic covalent heme binding to the TPO molecule.

Odell E. McGregor A.M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 266: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Recently, Taurog and Wall (6Taurog A. Wall M. Thyroid. 1998; 8: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) proposed His239 as the proximal binding site and His494 as the distal binding site. During the past 40 years, the nature of the heme prosthetic group of TPO has been debated. Hossaya and Morrison (7Hossaya T. Morrison M. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2828-2836Google Scholar), Krinsky and Alexander (8Krinsky M.M. Alexander N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4755-4758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Ohtaki et al. (9Ohtaki S. Nakagawa H. Nakamura S. Nakamura M. Yamazaki I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 441-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the prosthetic group of TPO might be a ferriprotoporphyrin IX. Rawitch et al. (2Rawitch A.B. Taurog A. Chernoff S.B. Dorris M.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 194: 244-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showed significant differences between the pyridine hemochromogene of TPO and horseradish peroxidase, suggesting that the heme in TPO is not ferriprotoporphyrin IX. TPO, lactoperoxidase (LPO), myeloperoxidase (MPO), saliva peroxidase, eosinoperoxidase, and intestinal peroxidase belong to the mammalian peroxidase family. These proteins share related protein primary structure (10Cals M.M. Mailliart P. Brignon G. Anglade P. Dumas B.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 733-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Fenna R. Zeng J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and are alike in spectral properties. Furthermore, their prosthetic heme moieties are not readily extracted by conventional approaches. Anderson et al. (12Andersson L.A. Bylkas S. Wilson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3406-3412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) considered that spectral similarities between LPO and other mammalian peroxidases indicated similar prosthetic heme moieties and a covalent attachment of the heme group to the protein. They suggested that the heme moiety of TPO is probably a type l heme, like LPO. This heme is covalently linked to the protein through ester bonds that link aspartate and glutamate residues (conserved in MPO, LPO, and TPO) and the hydroxymethyl group of heme. Heme is inserted into the protein certainly in the endoplasmic reticulum, as for MPO (13Arnljots K. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10430-10433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This insertion seems necessary for the proteolytic processing leading to the formation of an enzymatically active mature MPO and for the exit of MPO from the ER and its subsequent targeting to the lysosomes (14Nauseef W. McCormick S. Yi H. Blood. 1992; 80: 2622-2633Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We had proposed a model for the folding, degradation, and intracellular trafficking of human TPO (hTPO) in CHO cells (15Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We showed that after synthesis only 2% of the hTPO molecules exited from the ER and reached the cell surface. The remaining 98% are more or less rapidly degraded depending on their folding state. In the present work, we looked into the role of the heme moiety insertion in the exit of hTPO from the ER. We also investigated a possible H2O2-dependent autocatalytic modification of heme, responsible for its subsequent covalent attachment to TPO, as described by the group of Montellano (16DePillis G. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) for LPO. Effectively in thyroid cells, H2O2 is synthesized at the apical cell surface level and then could be implicated in this covalent linking of the heme prosthetic group to TPO. Sigma supplied the following: succinyl acetone (SA), hemin, aminolevulinic acid (ALA), holotransferrin (FeTf), catalase, and BT2cAMP. Penicillin and streptomycin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Complete) were from Boehringer Mannheim (Le Meylan, France). Na125I was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Les Ullis, France). Expre35S35S protein labeling mix (referred to as “35S-(Met + Cys)”) and14C-aminolevulinic acid were from NEN Life Science (Paris, France). Streptavidin-agarose and sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide) ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin) were from Pierce. Protein A-Sepharose 4B was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against hTPO were given by J. Ruf. Stock solutions of hemin (2 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were prepared immediately before experiments and dissolved by the addition of 0.15m NaOH to obtain a pH range between 7.0 and 7.5. Succinyl acetone (25 mm in PBS), holotransferrin (1 mg/ml in PBS), and catalase (1% in PBS) solutions were freshly prepared for each experiment and filter-sterilized before the addition in culture medium. As described (15Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), full-length 3060-kilobase pair human TPO cDNA (kindly provided by B. Rapoport) was cloned into the eukaryotic transfer vector pcDNA3, and after stable transfection a CHO cell line (CHO-hTPO cells) expressing hTPO was obtained. The cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and expression of hTPO was stimulated 48 h before experiments with sodium butyrate (5 mm). Primocultures of porcine thyroid cells were performed as described (17Chambard M. Verrier B. Gabrion J. Mauchamp J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Porcine thyroid cells were isolated by discontinuous trypsin-EGTA treatment and suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were seeded in 9.6-cm2 dishes and incubated at 36 °C in a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Culture media were changed every 2–3 days. After 3–5 days, a monolayer was obtained, and the cells were stimulated with 10−4m Bt2cAMP for 5 days. Confluent cells were radiolabeled for up to 6 days with 100 μCi/ml 35S-(Met + Cys) in cysteine- and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, and 10 mm sodium butyrate. Cell monolayers were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 8.0, supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS-CM) before the cross-linker (NHS-SS-biotin) was added at 0.5 mg/ml in PBS-CM for 20 min on ice. Cross-linker was removed, and the same operation was repeated once. Then the medium was removed, and the remaining reactive NHS-SS-biotin was blocked by the addition of 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS-CM. The cells were then scraped in 600 μl of extraction buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.3% deoxycholic acid, and protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were then tumbled for 20 min at 4 °C with vortexing every 2 min and centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h with (mAb 47 + mAb 15)-protein A-Sepharose complexes. These mAbs had been complexed with protein A by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were retrieved by a brief centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 s) and washed four times with 1 ml of hTPO extraction buffer. The immunoprecipitated hTPO was separated from the protein A-Sepharose pellet by heating 5 min at 100 °C after the addition of 10 μl of 10% SDS and 500 μl of hTPO extraction buffer. The suspension was diluted with 500 μl of hTPO extraction buffer and centrifuged for 3 min at 10,000 ×g. The supernatant was incubated 2 h with avidin-agarose at room temperature. Biotinylated surface hTPO and intracellular hTPO were separated by centrifugation (10 s, 10,000 × g). The beads were washed four times with hTPO extraction buffer and once with PBS, resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar), and then boiled for 5 min. The totality of supernatant corresponding to the cell surface fraction and only 110 of the supernatant corresponding to the intracellular fraction were prepared for SDS-PAGE analysis. The radioactivity was visualized and quantified by a phosphor imager (Fuji BAS 1000). CHO-hTPO cells were incubated in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate, 1% FBS, and 10 μCi of [14C]aminolevulinic acid for 48 h. After 48 h, intracellular and cell surface radiolabeled hTPO molecules were separated by cell surface biotinylation, immunoprecipitated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE as described above. 14C-Heme-labeled hTPO was treated with acetone/HCl as described previously for other hemoproteins (19Kuras R. de Vitry C. Choquet Y. Girard-Bascou J. Culler D. Büschlen S. Merchant S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32427-32435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) with small modifications. CHO-hTPO cells were labeled with [14C]aminolevulinic acid as described above. The14C-heme-labeled hTPO was immunoprecipitated and separated from protein A-Sepharose pellet by heating 5 min at 100 °C after the addition of 10 μl of 10% SDS. Then 40 μl of hTPO extraction buffer was added, and the suspension was centrifuged (3 min, 10,000 ×g). The supernatant was supplemented with 1 ml of acetone containing 0.2% HCl (12 n) and 20 μg of bovine serum albumin and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (10 min, 10,000 × g), the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was dried using a Speed Vac. This pellet was dissolved in 100 μl of Laemmli buffer, heated 5 min at 100 °C, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Enzymatic activity was investigated as described by Neary et al. (20Neary J.T. Soodak M. Maloof F. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 445-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS buffer. The incubation mixture contained bovine serum albumin (5 mg/ml in PBS) and Na125I (106cpm/ml). The reaction was initiated by the addition of H2O2 to obtain a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. At the end of this incubation time, the medium was transferred to cold reaction tubes, and the cell surface was washed once with 0.5 ml of PBS. Then 1 ml of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloracetic acid supplemented with 10−4m KI was added to each tube. After 20 min at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged (2000 ×g, 6 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the acid-insoluble iodinated material obtained was washed three times with 2 ml of 10% trichloracetic acid. The radioactivity remaining in the pellet was counted. Total porphyrin concentration was determined fluorometrically as described by Sassa (21Sassa S. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This method is based on the conversion of the heme moiety of the protein into its fluorescent porphyrin derivative by the removal of heme under acidic reducing conditions. Our previous data (15Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) revealed that in CHO cells, only 2% of hTPO molecules reach the cell surface, and the rest (98%) are degraded. To determine if the heme moiety had to be inserted into hTPO for its exit from the ER, we first used SA, a specific inhibitor of 5-aminolevulinic dehydratase, which catalyzes the formation of porpholibinogen from 5-aminolevulinate in the heme biosynthesis pathway (22Ponka P. Blood. 1997; 89: 1-25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Vyoral D. Blood. 1996; 87: 3477-3488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CHO-hTPO cells were incubated for 16 h, 3 days, or 6 days with or without 250 μm SA. CHO cells tolerated SA well at this concentration for up to 6 days with no change in cell morphology. In a first set of experiments, we determined the effects of SA on the total porphyrin concentration in the cells as described by Sassa (Ref. 21Sassa S. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 143: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar; see “Experimental Procedures”). Compared with control, with SA the total porphyrin concentration decreased by 20, 50, and 50% for incubation times of 16 h, 3 days, and 6 days, respectively. Then we studied the effect of SA on hTPO enzymatic activity and delivery at the cell surface (Fig.1). After 16 h of incubation with SA the delivery of hTPO at the cell surface decreased by 37%, and the activity was decreased by 79%. After 3 and 6 days, the cell surface delivery decreased by 25 and 35%, and the activity decreased by 68 and 92%, respectively. Note that whatever the incubation time with SA, the decrease in delivery at the cell surface remains stable (about 30%) and is similar to or a little lower than the decrease in total porphyrin synthesis and that the decrease in hTPO activity is higher (68 and 92%) than the decrease in total porphyrin synthesis (20–50%). To confirm that SA impaired only heme biosynthesis without affecting intracellular transport of protein(s) not containing heme, we measured delivery at the cell surface of Na+-K+-ATPase. The trafficking of Na+-K+-ATPase was unaffected by SA (data not shown). To verify that the concentration of heme in CHO-hTPO cells is not a limiting factor (that could explain the low percentage of hTPO reaching the plasma membrane) we enhanced heme biosynthesis pathway by adding to the culture medium ALA, FeTf, or hemin for 48 h (Fig.2). For cell surface biotinylation assays, cells were incubated for 48 h with 35S-(Met + Cys) with or without those components. In cell surface activity experiments, a negative control was performed with methylmercaptoimidazole. Adding ALA or FeTf to the culture medium had no effect on activity and delivery at the cell surface, contrary to the association ALA plus FeTf and hemin, which increased delivery at the cell surface by 20% (Fig. 2 B) and the enzymatic activity by 20% for ALA plus FeTf and 120% for hemin (Fig. 2 A). Note that a 48-h treatment with ALA plus FeTf leads to a 10-fold higher concentration of total porphyrin in the cells than in control. The moderate increase (20%) in the delivery at the cell surface with ALA plus FeTf or with hemin shows that heme biosynthesis in CHO cells is only slightly limiting. Together with the SA data (Fig. 1), the first conclusion is that the insertion of heme is important for hTPO intracellular trafficking and delivery at the cell surface. We found that SA has no noticeable effect on hTPO stability because the half-life of hTPO remained unchanged with or without SA (data not shown). Concerning the importance of insertion of heme in other proteins for the exit from the ER, similar results have been obtained with MPO (13Arnljots K. Olsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10430-10433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, heme insertion into cytochromeb 558 plays an important role in its subunit assembly (24Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Hemin increased the quantity of hTPO at the cell surface level by 20% and increased the cell surface activity by 120%. These values suggest that some of the hTPO molecules at the cell surface are inactive because they lack heme. That hTPO binds hemin added in culture medium agrees with the conclusion of Fan et al. (25Fan J.L. Patibandla S. Kimura S. Rao T. Desai R.K. Seetharamaiah G.S. Kurosky A. Prabhakar B.S. J. Autoimmun. 1996; 9: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and Guoet al. (26Guo J. McLachlan S. Hutchison S. Rapoport B. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). It could be hypothesized that heme associates with hTPO in the ER and that part of this heme is dissociated from the enzyme after hTPO exits from the ER, especially at the cell surface. In mammalian peroxidases, the heme moiety is covalently linked to the protein backbone (11Fenna R. Zeng J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Andersson L.A. Bylkas S. Wilson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3406-3412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, TPO, LPO, MPO, and EPO belong to the mammalian peroxidase family. Spectral analysis (12Andersson L.A. Bylkas S. Wilson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3406-3412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) indicated that the heme of TPO could be a type l heme like LPO. Moreover, Kooter et al. (27Kooter I.M. Pierik A.J. Merkx M. Averill B.A. Moguilevsky N. Bollen A. Wever R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 11542-11543Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar) also indicated that the prosthetic group of mammalian peroxidase was 1,5-dihydroxymethyl-modified heme b attached by covalent bonds to the protein. For type l and m (heme moiety of MPO) heme, the heme moiety is covalently linked to the protein through two ester bonds that link aspartate and glutamate residues (conserved in all mammalian peroxidases) of the protein with the heme hydroxymethyl groups. For MPO, there is an additional vinyl sulfonium link involving a methionine residue (not conserved in TPO and LPO) of the protein and the 2-vinyl moiety of the heme. Total dissociation of noncovalently bound heme from protein is classically obtained using acidic treatment. However, for some hemoproteins, SDS treatment leads to heme removal (19Kuras R. de Vitry C. Choquet Y. Girard-Bascou J. Culler D. Büschlen S. Merchant S. Wollman F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32427-32435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To see if heme was covalently linked to hTPO in CHO-hTPO cells and if acidic and SDS treatment provided the same results, we incubated CHO-hTPO cells in the presence of [14C]ALA for 48 h. After immunoprecipitation, the 14C-heme-labeled hTPO was treated by acetone/HCl or SDS/2-mercaptoethanol and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The result obtained is showed in Fig. 3. After quantification by phosphor imaging no difference was found between the two treatments. Therefore, we can assume that in CHO-hTPO cells heme can covalently link to hTPO and that after denaturation by SDS and reduction only covalently bound heme remains associated with this protein. Recently, DePillis et al. (16DePillis G. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) proposed a mechanism for autocatalytic heme modification and covalent binding in LPO and other mammalian peroxidases. In the presence of H2O2, heme could be autocatalytically modified and could subsequently be linked covalently to the protein. We hypothesize that in CHO cells there is an insufficient exposure to H2O2before hTPO reaches the cell surface. This would explain the dissociation of the heme from the protein after its exit from the ER. In most cells, H2O2 availability in the intracellular compartments is controlled by cytosolic selenium-containing GSH peroxidase, peroxisomal catalase, or PRX enzymes (28Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, Oxford1991: 86-187Google Scholar, 29Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that the heme moiety of TPO could be covalently linked to the protein through an autocatalytic process as for LPO (16DePillis G. Ozaki S. Kuo J.M. Maltby D.A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8857-8860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we incubated CHO-hTPO cells with or without 10 μm H2O2 for 10 min or 20 μm hemin for 10 min or 48 h before assaying hTPO activity (Fig. 4). A 10-min exposure to 10 μm H2O2 led to a 65% increase in cell surface activity. This great increase is similar to that obtained with a 10-min treatment with hemin, indicating that hTPO activity increases in parallel with the extent of covalent heme binding. Because of the short exposure time to H2O2 (10 min), this compound can act only on the activity of the hTPO molecules at the cell surface. To check if an increase in covalent heme binding and then in activity could be obtained by extending the incubation time with H2O2, we incubated CHO-hTPO cells with or without 10 μm H2O2 for 24 h. Enzymatic activity and delivery of hTPO at the cell surface were measured (Fig. 5). With H2O2 activity increased slightly (10%) (Fig.5 A), delivery at the cell surface decreased by 30% (Fig.5 B) because protein synthesis was inhibited by H2O2. Hence, long exposure to H2O2 does not notably increase the enzymatic activity. This may be due to a toxic effect of H2O2 on the cells and/or an impossibility of maintaining a constant concentration of H2O2 in the culture medium. However, as shown in Figs. 4 and 5, the hTPO at the cell surface may have 1) a noncovalently linked heme that can react with exogenous H2O2 and then increase activity, 2) no heme (thus explaining the results with hemin), or 3) a covalently linked heme (Fig. 6 A). To determine if covalent linking occurs intracellularly and if cell surface hTPO has a covalently linked heme, we investigated the incorporation of [14C]ALA (a radiolabeled precursor of heme biosynthesis) into hTPO in the intracellular compartments or at the cell surface by using a cell surface biotinylation technique. After immunoprecipitation of the protein with a couple of mAbs (15Fayadat L. Niccoli-Sire P. Lanet J. Franc J.L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), analysis was done by SDS-PAGE after denaturation of the protein with SDS and reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 7). Depending on the experiments, 50–70% of heme was recovered covalently linked to hTPO in the intracellular compartment, and 30–50% was recovered at the cell surface level. It was not possible to determine the relative quantity of the hTPO bearing or not bearing heme and of the hTPO with a heme covalently linked.Figure 5Effect of a 24-h incubation with H2O2 on the activity and delivery of hTPO at the cell surface. A, CHO-hTPO cells were cultured with or without H2O2 (10 μm) for 24 h before hTPO activity was assayed. B, CHO-hTPO cells were incubated as in A, but the cell culture medium was supplemented with 35S-(Met + Cys). After cell surface biotinylation and hTPO immunoprecipitation, the percentage of hTPO at the cell surface level was determined. Specific activity of hTPO at the cell surface after incubation for 24 h with or without H2O2 was determined. Statistically significant differences versus control were as follows:p < 0.01 (★★).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 6Model for the attachment of heme to hTPO in CHO-hTPO cells (A) and in thyroid cells (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 7Incorporation of [14C]ALA into hTPO present at the intracellular level or at the cell surface.Cells were incubated for 48 h with [14C]ALA. After cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation,14C-hTPO in the intracellular compartments or at the cell surface was analyzed by SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that covalent attachment of heme to hTPO required H2O2, we investigated the incorporation of [14C]ALA into the hTPO present at the cell surface with or without treatment with H2O2 for 10 min (Fig.8). Depending on the experiment, we detected between 2- and 5-fold more [14C]ALA associated with hTPO when the cells were treated for 10 min with 10 μm H2O2 before cell surface biotinylation. Furthermore, this result also confirms that the increase in cell activity observed at the cell surface level in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 4) results from a direct effect on the hTPO and not, for example, from a removal of an inhibitory ligand linked to this enzyme. Intracellular H2O2 leading to covalent heme binding is probably a by-product of electron transfer reactions. However, in contrast to CHO cells, thyroid cells have an additional physiological production of H2O2 that is involved in the iodination reactions at the apical cell surface and in thyroid hormone synthesis. This H2O2 is generated by an NADPH oxidase system in the apical membrane (30Gorin Y. Ohayon R. Carvalho D.P. Dème D. Leseney A.M. Kaniewski J. Pommier J. Virion A. Dupuy C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, H2O2 synthesized at the apical cell surface of thyroid cells might contribute to covalent attachment of heme (Fig.6 B). To verify this, we prepared primocultures of porcine thyroid cells and examined the effects of a 10-min incubation with 10 μm H2O2 and a 48-h treatment with 20 μm hemin or 0.01% catalase. In these culture conditions, thyroid cells form monolayers with an apical pole oriented toward the culture medium (17Chambard M. Verrier B. Gabrion J. Mauchamp J. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1172-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Hemin increased hTPO activity by 30% (Fig. 9), which is less than the percentage with CHO cells, because most heme is covalently linked to hTPO at the cell surface because of the production of H2O2 by thyroid cells. This was confirmed by the absence of effect of H2O2 added for 10 min in the culture medium (Fig. 9). However, the increase with hemin shows that some hTPO at the cell surface does not bear heme. Consequently, some hTPO may reach the cell surface without heme. The increase with hemin may also be attributed to by the type of culture used, primoculture in monolayer. H2O2 synthesized at the apical cell surface level is likely to be diluted into the culture medium, which would allow covalent heme binding in a less efficient way than in thyroid follicles. These results were confirmed by incubating cells with catalase for 48 h (with the addition of enzyme after 24 h), which led to a 30% decrease in hTPO activity at the surface of thyroid cells. We can assume the catalase in the culture medium is unable to pass the plasma membrane. Its H2O2 degradation action is then restricted to the cell surface. Catalase addition does not cause a greater inhibition of hTPO activity 1) because some heme can be linked covalently to hTPO intracellularly and 2) because of the half-life of hTPO at the cell surface level, and covalently bound heme remained with hTPO molecules synthesized before catalase addition. This study shows that heme insertion into hTPO is important for the delivery of protein at the cell surface and that the heme moiety is covalently bound to hTPO through the H2O2-dependent autocatalytic process as for LPO (16DePillis G.

Also, we found a new role for H2O2 generated at the apical membrane of thyroid cells besides its classical role in TPO-catalyzed iodotyrosines and thyroid hormone formation; apical H2O2 helps to stabilize TPO into an active form through its contribution in autocatalytic covalent attachment of heme to TPO.

In terms of their substrate specificities, the caspases can be classified into three groups (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M.

Group I caspases (caspases 1, 4, and 5) prefer the tetrapeptide sequence WEHD; group II caspases (caspases 2, 3, and 7) have a DEXD specificity, whereas group III caspases (caspases 6, 8, 9, and 10) cleave after (I/L/V)EXD. It should be noted, however, that these are only the preferred substrate motifs and are not absolute, being dependent on factors such as concentration, reaction time, and accessibility. Multiple redundancies are common among the caspases, with many caspases having the ability to cleave the same substrates, at least in vitro (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M.

There is an additional level of complexity with the discovery that multiple isoforms are present for many caspases, including caspases 1, 2, 6, and 8 (19Cohen G.M.

We describe their tissue expression and activity both in vitro and in vivo and examine the effect of exogenous stimulation by TNF on their mRNA expression. Expression vectors coding for PARP or caspase-3/Yama and the 293T cell line were generous gifts from Dr. V. Dixit. Antibodies against the large and small catalytic subunits of caspase-10 were obtained from Research Diagnostics, Inc. The polyclonal serum directed against a caspase-10/c-specific peptide sequence (EGSCVQDESEPQRPL) was produced by Genosys, Inc. Chemiluminescent Western blots were developed using the Immun-Star kit from Bio-Rad. Unless otherwise mentioned, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. PCR was performed on human spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes cDNA libraries (CLONTECH) using primers 5MCH4 (AAA GGA TCC GCT AGC ATG AAA TCT CAA GGT CAA CAT TGG TAT TCC) and 3MCH4 (AAA GAA TTC CTA TAT TGA AAG TGC ATC CAG GGG CAC AGG) to obtain the coding regions of Mch4, caspase-10/c, and caspase-10/d. Advantage-HF polymerase (CLONTECH) was used with cycling conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The final clones were from spleen (caspase-10/c) and thymus (caspase-10/d). The PCR products were inserted into pCITE-4a(+) (Novagen) for in vitro expression as S-Tag fusion proteins or pCI-neo (Promega) for in vivoeukaryotic expression. The primers C614 (CCG AGT CGT ATC AAG GAG AGG AAG AAC) and 3BRIDGE (TAT ATG CAC TGT GAA CCC AAG CCA) were used in PCR and RT-PCR experiments to obtain short DNA fragments corresponding to Mch4, caspase-10/c, and caspase-10/d. RNA from various cell lines was purified using the Qiagen RNAeasy kit, and reverse-transcription was performed using SuperScript II enzyme with oligo(dT) primers from Life Technologies, Inc. PCR was then performed for 30 cycles on the resulting cDNA at an annealing/extension temperature of 68 °C using Advantage-HF polymerase or on cDNA from adult and fetal multiple tissue cDNA panels (CLONTECH), and the products were analyzed in ethidium bromide-stained 2.5% agarose gels. For the killing assays, MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells/60-mm dish in 5 ml of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At ∼60–80% confluence, each dish of cells was transfected with 4 μg of pCI-neo expression vector with or without the CASP insert and 1 μg of pCMV-βgal reporter plasmid (CLONTECH) using Tfx-20 reagent (Promega) as directed by the manufacturer, except that the cells were washed once with PBS before incubation with the DNA-transfection reagent complex, and incubation was for 45 min at 37 °C. Where required, tetrapeptide inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CHO or Ac-DEVD-CHO (Biomol) were added after this incubation. Approximately 16–24 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.2% 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal), 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 5 mmK3Fe(CN)6 for 2 to 10 h at 37 °C. Blue-stained cells were scored as apoptotic on the basis of morphology. Four random microscopic fields per dish were counted with a minimum of 400 blue cells per data set. For the concurrent determination of PARP cleavage, transfected cells were boiled in 500 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 7.5% Ficoll Type 400, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue), and the extracts were immunoblotted using polyclonal anti-PARP antiserum (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). For the solubility studies, 293T or MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish in 10 ml of growth medium. At approximately 80% confluence, the cells were transfected with 12 μg of plasmid DNA, with the addition of Ac-DEVD-CHO inhibitor at a final concentration of 20 μm to delay cell death. At 24 h post-transfection, the cells were scraped and pelleted by centrifugation. Total lysates were obtained by boiling the pellets in 1 ml of Laemmli sample buffer. In experiments separating soluble from insoluble fractions, pellets were first incubated in lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, Complete Protease Inhibitor mix (Boehringer Mannheim)) for 30 min at 4 °C, then centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was harvested as the soluble fraction, whereas the pellet was washed three times with lysis buffer, then boiled in 300 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and used as the insoluble fraction. Immunoblotting was carried out using either commercial goat anti-Mch4 p12 subunit antibody at 1:500 dilution or custom anti-caspase-10/c polyclonal antiserum at 1:1000 dilution in blocking buffer (5% milk/PBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Constructs of Mch4, caspase-10/c, and caspase-10/d fused to the N terminus of EGFP were made by cloning the respective cDNAs into pEGFP-N3 (CLONTECH). MCF7 cells were transfected in 60-mm dishes using 2 μg of pEGFP-N3-derived plasmids in the presence of 50 μg of Ac-DEVD-CHO. Approximately 16 h post-transfection, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, PBS for 15 min at 25 °C, then equilibrated in 2× SSC buffer (15 mm sodium citrate, 150 mm NaCl) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 100 μg/ml DNase-free RNase in 2× SSC. After rinsing with 2× SSC, the cells were stained for 2 min in propidium iodide for nuclear visualization, mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories), and visualized under confocal laser scanning microscopy (Bio-Rad MRC 1024). MCF7 cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish in 10 ml of growth medium, then grown to high density, usually 48 h post-seeding. Recombinant human TNFα (BIOSOURCE) was added directly to the conditioned medium at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml where required. Treated cells were harvested, and RT-PCR was performed essentially as described above. MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. Approximately 48 h post-seeding, recombinant human TNFα was added at a final concentration of 50 ng/ml. At various time points, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with 100 μl of PBS, fixed in 5% formaldehyde, PBS for 5 min, then stained for 20 min at room temperature in a solution of 0.5% crystal violet, 20% methanol. After thorough washing to remove unincorporated dye, the plates were dried completely at room temperature. The stained cells were then lysed using 50 μl of 33% acetic acid per well, and the absorbance at 550 nm was measured in a microplate reader. The coding regions of Mch4, caspase-10/c, and caspase-10/d starting from Ile (194) (14Fernandes-Alnemri T. Armstrong R.C. Krebs J. Srinivasula S.M. Wang L. Bullrich F. Fritz L.C. Trapani J.A.

The pellets from 200 ml of 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced culture were resuspended in 20 ml of ICE cleavage buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS) and sonicated for 3 × 20 s. After centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g, the supernatants were collected and used as the source of active caspase. Between 2 and 5 μl of induced sonicate (depending on the amount of processed p12 small subunit, as described under “Results”) was added to 3 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled substrates expressed in vitro using the T7 Quick TnT system (Promega). ICE cleavage buffer was then added to a final volume of 30 μl. Where used, the tetrapeptide inhibitors Ac-YVAD-CHO and Ac-DEVD-CHO were added to a final concentration of 1 μm. In some experiments, the radiolabeled in vitro translated proteins were first affinity-purified by mixing the entire translation product with 200 μl of S-protein agarose slurry (Novagen) and using 10 μl of the washed, protein-bound matrix as substrates. Previous reports had indicated the possible existence of multiple isoforms of caspase-10 (15Vincenz C. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Our initial cloning by PCR of what appeared to be a single band of approximately 1500 bp emerged on sequencing to consist of three individual DNA fragments, wild type Mch4 (1440 bp), caspase-10/c (1477 bp), and caspase-10/d (1569 bp). It was possible to distinguish electrophoretically between these three DNAs by designing PCR primers (5MCH4/3BRIDGE) spanning a mid-insert region (comprising exons 6 and 7) common to caspase-10/d and FLICE2 (Fig.1). Bands of 230, 260, and 350 bp in size corresponded to Mch4, caspase-10/c, and caspase-10/d, respectively (see below). In the recent paper on the characterization of Usurpin (22Rasper D.M. Vaillancourt J.P. Hadano S. Houtzager V.M. Seiden I. Keen S.L.C. Tawa P. Xanthoudakis S. Nasir J. Martindale D. Koop B.F. Peterson E.P. Thornberry N.A. Huang J. MacPherson D.P. Black S.C. Hornung F. Lenardo M.J. Hayden M.R. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), the authors described the sequencing of the death effector domain (DED)-caspase gene cluster on human chromosome 2 band q33–34, which contains the genes for Usurpin, caspase-10/a/Mch4, and caspase-8/a/FLICE. Based on the genomic map, the mid-insert region mentioned above consists of exons 6 and 7 (Fig. 1). Hence Mch4 lacks exons 6, 7, and 11. In contrast, FLICE2 contains exons 6 and 7 but skips exon 10 and contains part of exon 11. Caspase-10/c contains exon 6 but not 7, whereas caspase-10/d contains both exons 6 and 7(summarized in Fig. 1). The predicted amino acid sequences show that caspase-10/d is a hybrid of FLICE2 and Mch4 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the insertion of exon 6 in caspase-10/c leads to a frameshift at the protein level, resulting in a protein that is truncated shortly after the DED-containing prodomain. Thus, caspase-10/c is essentially a prodomain-only protein (Fig. 2). We confirmed the authenticity of the predicted protein sequences by translation in vitro and by performing immunoblotting on the products. As predicted, in vitro translated caspase-10/d was slightly larger in size than Mch4 and was recognized by antibodies against both the large and small protease subunits of Mch4 (Fig.3). In vitro translated caspase-10/c was a much smaller protein of approximately 40 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3, upper panel) that was not recognized by either of the anti-protease subunit antibodies (Fig. 3, lower panel).Figure 3Antibodies against either the small or large protease subunits of Mch4 recognize caspase-10/d but not caspase-10/c. 5 μl of radiolabeled in vitrotranslated Mch4, caspase-10/c, or caspase-10/d were electrophoresed in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and either autoradiographed (A) or immunoblotted (Western blot) (B) with antibodies directed against the p12 subunit of Mch4 (lanes 1–4) or the p17 subunit of Mch4 (lanes 5–8). −, vector only; WT, Mch4; 10/c, caspase-10/c; 10/d, caspase-10/d.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the constitutive mRNA expression profiles of the caspase-10 variants, PCR and RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from various cell lines and on commercially available cDNA panels. Because the CLONTECHmultiple tissue cDNA panels are prenormalized against several housekeeping genes, we were able to directly compare the levels of mRNA expression between samples. The bands representing Mch4, caspase-10/c and caspase-10/d were 230, 260, and 350 bp in size, respectively (Fig. 4). Their identity was confirmed by subcloning and sequencing two independent clones of each DNA fragment from spleen, thymus, and peripheral blood leukocytes cDNA libraries. Although this method did not distinguish between FLICE2 and caspase-10/d expression (because they both contain the same exon 6 and 7 insert), it is clear that expression levels of caspase-10-related mRNAs are generally higher in fetal than in adult tissues (Fig. 4 A). In particular, Mch4, caspase-10/c, and FLICE2/caspase-10/d are highly expressed in fetal skeletal muscle, lung, and kidney, whereas their expression in these tissues is virtually undetectable in the adult. Expression of the caspase-10 isoforms was highly variable among various cell lines (Fig. 4 B). There was no obvious pattern in their distribution. The 350-bp FLICE2/caspase-10/d band was consistently highly expressed in all cell lines tested, whereas caspase-10/c and Mch4 were present at very low levels in the MCF7 breast carcinoma and SW480T adenocarcinoma cell lines (Fig. 4 B). Caspase-10/c was not absent, as increasing the number of PCR cycles resulted in easier visualization (not shown). Crude sonicated lysates of bacterial cultures expressing recombinant Mch4 and caspase-10/d were proteolytically active. Immunoblotting of the bacterial sonicates using antibodies against the Mch4 p12 small subunit revealed that autoprocessing had occurred in the case of Mch4 and caspase-10/d with the release of the p12 subunit but not with caspase-10/c (Fig. 5,panel A). The bacterial sonicates containing Mch4 and caspase-10/d cleavedin vitro translated full-length Mch4 and caspase-10/d proteins, demonstrating the possibility of intermolecular processing of caspase-10 isoforms (Fig. 5, panel B) and also cleavedin vitro translated PARP and caspase-3 (Fig. 5, panels C and D). Again, caspase-10/c was not proteolytically active in any of these experiments. The activity of Mch4 or caspase-10/d was completely abrogated by the addition of 1 μm specific caspase inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO but not Ac-YVAD-CHO (Fig. 5, panels C and D). The cleavage activity (and the inhibition thereof) is because of the expressed recombinant caspase and not to the activation of any other endogenous proteases because (i) bacteria do not have endogenous caspase activity (Ref. 23Srinivasula S.M.

In addition, we consistently observed that caspase-10/d was less active than Mch4 after normalization of the starting quantities of bacterial sonicates used based on the amount of processed p12 subunit. We quantitated this activity using the caspase substrate DEVD-pNA and confirmed that Mch4 was approximately twice as active as caspase-10/d (not shown). Despite the lack of a protease domain, caspase-10/c was highly efficient in causing apoptosis when transiently overexpressed in the MCF7 cell line. Caspase-10/d was also pro-apoptotic, as was Mch4 used as a control (Fig. 6). This killing by all three isoforms was caspase-dependent, as shown first by the dose-dependent inhibitory effect of the tetrapeptide inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 6, panel A) and second by the observation that PARP was cleaved in cells transfected with Mch4, caspase-10/c, or caspase-10/d (Fig. 6, panel B, lanes 3–5). Furthermore, the fact that Ac-DEVD-CHO but not Ac-YVAD-CHO inhibited killing indicated that apoptosis was transduced by downstream caspase-3-like enzymes, and caspase-1-like proteases were probably not involved (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Lysates of mammalian cells transiently overexpressing Mch4, caspase-10/c, or caspase-10/d were prepared as detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions, and immunoblotting was performed using either anti-Mch4 p12 antibodies to detect Mch4 and caspase-10/d or custom anti-caspase-10/c polyclonal antiserum. In both MCF7 and 293T cell lines, Mch4 and caspase-10/d were completely soluble, whereas caspase-10/c was predominantly insoluble (Fig.7). These results are consistent with recent evidence that DED-only proteins might form insoluble filamentous structures (death effector filaments, DEF) either on their own or in association with as yet unidentified cytoskeletal elements (24Siegel R.M. Martin D.A. Zheng L. Ng S.Y. Bertin J. Cohen J. Lenardo M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To determine whether DEFs were formed by caspase-10 isoforms, Mch4, caspase-10/c and caspase-10/d were ectopically expressed as EGFP fusion proteins in MCF7 and 293T cells and visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Distinct perinuclear filamentous structures were seen in all cells expressing caspase-10/c-EGFP (Fig.8, panel A). In most cases these filaments were closely bundled together, but more haphazard arrangements were sometimes also observed. EGFP alone was present in both the nucleus and diffused in the cytoplasm (Fig. 8, panels N1 and N2). Mch4-EGFP and caspase-10/d-EGFP were mostly diffused throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 8, panels WT1 and B), but filaments could be seen in some cells (Fig. 8, panels WT2 and B), although these were never as distinct as those seen in caspase-10/c-transfected cells. Killing assays performed on MCF7 cells transiently overexpressing EGFP-caspase-10 fusion proteins confirmed that these EGFP fusion proteins were functionally active and induced apoptosis (data not shown).Figure 8Caspase-10/c localizes to distinct perinuclear filaments. MCF7 cells transiently overexpressing EGFP (N1 and N2), Mch4-EGFP (WT1 andWT2), caspase-10/c-EGFP (A), or caspase-10/d-EGFP (B) were stained with propidium iodide to allow nuclear visualization then observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy.N2 is a single-channel output of N1 and shows the nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of EGFP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been shown that Mch4 and FLICE2 can associate with TNF receptor 1 via homotypic DED interactions with Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) (15Vincenz C.

In this study we have determined the crystal structure of the complex between chloroquine andP. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase. The bound chloroquine is clearly seen within the NADH binding pocket of the enzyme, occupying a position similar to that of the adenyl ring of the cofactor. Chloroquine hence competes with NADH for binding to the enzyme, acting as a competitive inhibitor for this critical glycolytic enzyme. Specific interactions between the drug and amino acids unique to the malarial form of the enzyme suggest this binding is selective. Inhibition studies confirm that chloroquine acts as a weak inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase, with mild selectivity for the parasite enzyme. As chloroquine has been shown to accumulate to millimolar concentrations within the food vacuole in the gut of the parasite, even low levels of inhibition may contribute to the biological efficacy of the drug. The structure of this enzyme-inhibitor complex provides a template from which the quinoline moiety might be modified to develop more efficient inhibitors of the enzyme.

P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase lactate dehydrogenase apo form of pfLDH with no cofactor or substrate bound chloroquine Malaria is one of the major diseases of mankind, claiming 3 million lives worldwide annually. Resistance to existing antimalarial drugs is a large and increasing problem. Recently we have determined the first high-resolution structure of an enzyme from thePlasmodium falciparum parasite, the causative agent of malaria. This 1.7-Å structure (1Dunn C.R. Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Higham C.W. Moreton K.M. Turgut-Balik D. Brady R.L. Holbrook J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) of the essential glycolytic enzymeP. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (pfLDH)1 has revealed a unique cleft adjacent to the active site, ideally suited as a target for the rational design of inhibitors. Another feature of the structure is a significant displacement of the NADH cofactor relative to other forms of LDH, reflecting that the malarial enzyme has a unique mode of association with the cofactor and hence a distinctive NADH binding pocket. These features suggest pfLDH may form an appropriate target for structure-based design of novel antimalarials. Chloroquine (CQ, Fig. 1,left) and related quinoline compounds have been used extensively throughout the world as prophylactics to prevent the development of malaria. Although the mechanism of action of CQ on the parasite is not completely understood, it is thought to interfere with the function of the food vacuole in the mature stages of the erythrocytic parasite (2Peters W. Chemotherapy and Drug Resistance in Malaria. Academic Press, London1970: 540-601Google Scholar). CQ is a weak base and accumulates to high concentrations within the acidic food vacuole (3Yayon A. Cabantchick Z.I. Ginsburg H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Within these vacuoles, hemoglobin is degraded by proteases to provide a supply of amino acids for the parasite, but also producing toxic heme moieties as a by-product (hematin; Fig. 1, right). The parasite normally detoxifies hematin by polymerizing the by-product to hemozoin, although the details of this process are unclear. Because CQ is known to bind to hematin, it was thought to exert its antimalarial activity by forming a complex with hematin, which inhibits its sequestration into hemozoin (4Fitch C.D. Proc. Helminthol. Soc. Washington. 1972; 39: 265-271Google Scholar). Free heme causes cell lysis, and so CQ complexation with hematin was thought to be toxic to the parasite. This hypothesis is no longer favored because of the failure to show the existence of free heme in parasite cells. It has also been suggested that the target for CQ is a protein or proteins involved in the digestion or disposal of hemoglobin (5Ginsburg H. Geary T.G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1567-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), although no target has been identified. CQ resistance is an increasingly serious problem and appears to correlate with decreased accumulation of the drug by CQ-resistant parasites. Identifying and understanding the interaction of proteins with CQ could lead the way to the development of new antimalarials to overcome these problems. Intriguingly, recent studies (6Foley M. Deady L.W. Ng K. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6955-6961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that photoreactive analogues of chloroquine interacted specifically with two proteins in infected red blood cells, one of which was identified (7Menting J.G.T. Tilley L. Deady L.W. Ng K. Simpson R.J. Cowman A.F. Foley M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) as pfLDH. In these studies some evidence for CQ binding to pfLDH was found, but it was not observed to inhibit the activity of pfLDH. However, CQ was found to modulate the inhibitory effect of hematin on LDH. Hematin itself strongly inhibits the malarial form of the enzyme (K i = 0.2 μm), about 100-fold tighter than its binding to mammalian forms of the enzyme (K i = 23 μm for bovine LDH). Equimolar amounts of CQ modestly decreased inhibition of the mammalian form by hematin by about 50% (K i = 33 μm), whereas inhibition of the malarial enzyme was reduced by at least 2 orders of magnitude in the presence of CQ. This protective effect of CQ is most likely because of the formation of a tight complex between CQ and hematin (8Chou A.C. Chevli R. Fitch C.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1543-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), this complex binding less strongly to LDH than does free hemin itself. In this study the crystal structure of the complex formed between chloroquine and pfLDH has been determined to assess the mode and the likely significance of this interaction. Additionally, the structure of this complex could provide a valuable starting point for structure-based modification of the quinoline skeleton for the development of novel antimalarials. This is of particular interest as the quinoline family of compounds on which CQ is based are widely available, synthetically accessible, generally orally bioavailable, and of low toxicity. In combination with inhibition assays, these studies confirm the presence of a specific binding site for chloroquine in the malarial form of the enzyme, and provide guidance for modification of the quinoline structure to form an effective, selective, and competitive inhibitor for this crucial malarial enzyme. Recombinant pfLDH and pig muscle LDH were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (1Dunn C.R. Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Higham C.W. Moreton K.M. Turgut-Balik D. Brady R.L. Holbrook J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Pig LDH is extremely similar to human LDH in sequence, structure, and activity and, because it is more readily available, was used as a representative form of mammalian LDH in this study. The fully activated forms of each enzyme were purified in a single step by affinity chromatography on an oxamate agarose column with NADH (9Wilks H.M. Moreton K.M. Halsall D.J. Hart K.W. Sessions R.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7802-7806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Bound NADH was removed by dialysis against charcoal until the A 280/A 260measured above 1.9. Crystals of the apo form of pfLDH (apo-pfLDH) were obtained at 18 °C by hanging drop vapor diffusion against a well containing 30% v/v 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 200 mm sodium citrate, and 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. The protein concentration was 50 mg ml−1. Crystals of the pfLDH·CQ complex were obtained by soaking crystals of apo-pfLDH for 72 h in mother liquor containing 5 mm chloroquine. Crystals of the CQ complex belong to the space group I222 with cell dimensions a = 79.9 Å, b = 85.4 Å, and c = 92.2 Å. The apo-LDH crystals have the same space group with cell dimensions ofa = 79.8 Å, b = 85.6Å, andc = 91.8 Å. Crystals were mounted in Hampton research cryoloops and frozen using an Oxford Cryosystems Cryostream. Crystals were frozen in mother liquor only. Data were collected on a Nonius Dip-2000 Image Plate at 100 K using Cu-Kα radiation, filtered with mirrors, from a Nonius FR591 rotating anode generator operated at 45 kV and 95 mA. Data were processed using DENZO (10Otwinoski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38526) Google Scholar) and are summarized in Table I. The structures were solved by molecular replacement with AMORE (11Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

The CQ·pfLDH complex structure was refined using iterative cycles of XPLOR (12Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1.

This wavelength was selected to avoid the strong absorbance of CQ at 340 nm. Absorbance changes over time (Fig. 2) were monitored using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda-2 spectrophotometer with assay conditions of 100 μm pyruvate and a range of NADH concentrations between 20 and 160 μm, in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with a protein concentration of 10 nm. Inhibition was monitored by measuring rates in the presence of CQ at concentrations between 0.8 and 12.8 mm. Both the apo and CQ complex forms of pfLDH adopt very similar overall structures (Fig. 3) with, in the absence of cofactor and substrate, characteristically open cofactor binding sites and disordered substrate specificity loops (residues 102–108). The root mean square deviation in all equivalent Cα positions between the two structures is 0.17 Å. Prominent density for the quinoline ring was evident in the initial electron density maps from crystals of the complex (Fig. 4 a), and assignment of the bound conformation of CQ was straightforward. There is no density for atoms beyond the second carbon atom of the 4′ substituent, which projects toward the solvent and is presumably disordered. The crystallographic structure shows that CQ is bound and partially buried within the cofactor binding site of pfLDH (Figs. 4 b and5), occupying a position similar to that of the adenyl ring of the cofactor in the ternary complex structure (1Dunn C.R. Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Higham C.W. Moreton K.M. Turgut-Balik D. Brady R.L. Holbrook J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When overlaid on the ternary structure (Fig. 5), the quinoline ring is seen to lie in a plane similar to that of the adenyl ring but is shifted by an average translation of 2.0 Å and rotation of about 30° in this plane. This leaves the chlorine pointing toward Asp-53, and the 4′ substituent projecting toward Glu-122. The quinoline ring itself appears to be tightly bound, with average temperature factors for the ring atoms of 16.7 Å2 compared with 11.3 Å2 for all protein atoms. Some 471 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area is occluded between the bound CQ and the protein (calculated with QUANTA).Figure 5Stereo view of a superimposition of the chloroquine complex onto the coordinates of ternary pfLDH (PDB code 1ldg.pdb, Ref. 1Dunn C.R.

The chlorine atom of chloroquine is depicted as a red sphere.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The drug makes a limited number of specific contacts with the protein (Fig. 4 b). Most prominent is a hydrogen bond to the charged side-chain of the glutamic acid at position 122. This residue is unique to the plasmodium form of the enzyme. In all mammalian forms of LDH, and most other forms, there is a Phe in this position that is not capable of making this interaction. There are two further hydrogen bonds between CQ and the protein. The ring nitrogen is involved in a hydrogen bond network to which the side chain of Asp-53 and main chain carbonyl group and nitrogen of glycine 99 also contribute. These are both highly conserved residues found in all LDH sequences known to date and are important for cofactor binding. This suggests these contacts would not contribute any specificity for binding the malarial form of the enzyme. Further selectivity appears to result from a series of hydrophobic interactions between the drug and enzyme. Perpendicular pi-stacking (14Singh J. Thornton J.M. FEBS Lett. 1985; 191: 1-6Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar) between the quinoline ring system and phenylalanine side chain at position 100 provides a further interaction unique to the malarial form of the enzyme. In mammalian LDHs, the equivalent residue is always either Ala or Val, both of which are incapable of pi-stacking. This residue is at the base of the extended specificity loop, a dominant region of difference between pfLDH and all other LDH structures and which forms a prominent cleft alongside the active site (1Dunn C.R. Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Higham C.W. Moreton K.M. Turgut-Balik D. Brady R.L. Holbrook J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Other nearby aromatics include Phe-52 and Tyr-85, the former again unique to pfLDH. A dominant feature in the electron density for the quinoline is the chlorine atom. When compared with the ternary complex (Fig. 3), the chlorine is seen to occupy a similar position to the N3 atom of the adenyl ring from NADH. The chlorine makes surprisingly few contacts with the protein, these being limited to van der Waals contacts with Gly-27 and Ala-98, both of which are highly conserved residues, and limited contact with Asp-53. The bulk of this predominantly hydrophobic atom may be an important factor in orienting the quinoline for binding. The results of the inhibition studies are consistent with chloroquine being a competitive inhibitor (with respect to NADH) of the LDH enzyme activity (Fig. 2). Analysis of the data gave CQ inhibition constants (K i) of 1.3 ± 0.2 mm with pfLDH and 3.5 ± 0.3 mm with pig muscle LDH at pH 7.0. Inhibition of pfLDH at pH 8.0 by CQ is unchanged, but theK i rises to 5 mm at pH 6.0 (data not shown). This suggests preferential binding of the monoprotonated form of CQ over the diprotonated species. A comparison of the apo and CQ complex structures of pfLDH shows there is very little change in the protein structure on CQ binding (Fig. 3), with the overall root mean square deviation for positions of all Cα atoms between the two structures of only 0.17 Å. The largest changes are observed in or adjacent to the CQ binding site, where the Cα of Ile-54 moves by 0.74 Å and Asp-86 Cα by 0.8 Å. Two ordered water molecules observed in the apo structure are displaced on binding of CQ. A comparison of both the apo and CQ complex structures with the ternary structure of pfLDH (1Dunn C.R. Banfield M.J. Barker J.J. Higham C.W. Moreton K.M. Turgut-Balik D. Brady R.L. Holbrook J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) shows more substantial rearrangements, most significantly in the extended substrate-binding loop (residues 102–108). In the absence of bound substrate and cofactor, this loop is disordered in both the apo and CQ complex structures. This has previously been noted for apo forms of other lactate dehydrogenases (15White J.L. Hackert M.L. Buehner M. Adams M.J. Ford G.C. Lentz P.J. Smiley I.E. Steindel S.J. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 102: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16Musick W.D.L. Rossmann M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7611-7620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Piontek K. Chakrabarti P. Schar H.P. Rossmann M.G. Zuber H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1990; 7: 74-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the ternary complex of pfLDH + NADH + oxamate (a substrate analogue) revealed an unusual association between cofactor and enzyme, evidenced by an approximately 1-Å shift in the placement of the nicotinamide group relative to other forms of LDH. This alteration is believed to be an adaptation assisting the parasite to survive in the anaerobic conditions prevalent within erythrocytes by reducing product inhibition associated with the enzyme. This movement originates from a series of amino acid changes along the cofactor binding groove but concentrated in the region occupied by the nicotinamide group. In the CQ binding region, there is only one minor change within van der Waals contact of the quinoline, Ile-54 (normally valine in mammalian LDHs). The overall retention of shape complementarity between the mammalian and malarial forms in this region is consistent with CQ also binding the mammalian form of the enzyme, albeit with lower affinity in the absence of the specific interactions with Asp-53, Phe-100, and Glu-122. Although in previous work (7Menting J.G.T. Tilley L. Deady L.W. Ng K. Simpson R.J. Cowman A.F. Foley M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) some evidence of CQ binding to pfLDH was reported, CQ was not found to inhibit pfLDH activity. The overlap of the CQ and NADH binding sites observed in the crystal structures suggested CQ should form a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme because the cofactor is required to bind and then be released during the catalytic cycle. This expectation was confirmed by the enzymatic activity experiments. The measured K i values of 1.3 and 3.5 mm for inhibition of malarial and pig LDH, respectively, are high, partially explaining previous descriptions that CQ was not inhibitory. The inhibition is competitive with respect to NADH for both enzymes, as shown by the Y-axis intercepts in Fig. 2. This behavior is consistent with the crystal structure which shows a single binding site for CQ in the NADH-adenine pocket. Although it seems unlikely that inhibition at this level would provide a sufficient explanation for the effectiveness of CQ as an antimalarial, this activity might be amplified in vivo through the high local levels of CQ known to accumulate within the parasite (3Yayon A. Cabantchick Z.I. Ginsburg H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). There is some support for this in the experiments of previous workers (6Foley M. Deady L.W. Ng K. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6955-6961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Menting J.G.T. Tilley L. Deady L.W. Ng K. Simpson R.J. Cowman A.F. Foley M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 88: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) where labeled CQ analogues appear to have been sufficiently concentrated within the intracellular compartments of parasites, in infected erythrocytes, to enable isolation of CQ·pfLDH affinity labeled complexes. However, the limited affinity and selectivity of CQ for the malarial form of the enzyme suggests any biological efficacy derived through this route is likely to be supplementary to other antimalarial activities of the quinolines. The low level of inhibition by CQ correlates with the limited interactions observed between CQ and the enzyme. It is additionally unsurprising that the selectivity for the malarial form of the enzyme is not pronounced. Despite the specific interactions described above, there remain a significant number of common structural features within the CQ binding site between the malarial and pig LDH structures. However, although the K i values are relatively high, it is important to note that the association of CQ with the malarial form is favored by a net change in free energy equivalent to about 2 kJ/mol relative to mammalian LDH. This modest gain suggests that the quinoline template might provide a useful lead from which further specificity and binding could be developed. As glycolysis is the principle source of ATP for the parasite, which cannot undertake oxidative phosphorylation (18Vander Jagt D.L. Hunsaker L.A. Campos N.M. Baack B.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), disruption of the glycolytic pathway by inhibition of pfLDH appears to be an effective route for killing the parasite. The proximity of the CQ binding site to other regions of the enzyme both important for its activity and of unique structure compared with human LDH implies that the inclusion of quinoline moieties in composite compounds capable of bridging these regions might lead to dramatic additive increases in both selectivity and inhibitory activity. Parallels for the development of inhibitors to nucleotide binding sites have, for example, recently been described by Grayet al. (19Gray N.S. Wodicka L. Thunnissen A.-M.W.H. Norman T.C. Kwon S. Espinoza F.H. Morgan D.O. Barnes G. LeClerc S. Meijer L. Kim S.-H. Lockhart D.J. Schultz P.G.

Using fluorescence studies, we have been able to show hematin binds tightly to pfLDH (K d = 0.25 μm, results not shown) but so far have been unable to produce crystals of a hematin·pfLDH complex. The modulatory effect of CQ on hematin inhibition is consistent with related binding sites for both compounds, and the CQ/hematin adduct, on the enzyme. The mode of action of chloroquine and related quinolines has remained unclear despite extensive usage of these compounds as antimalarials for many years. Structural analysis of complexes of these compounds with their molecular targets could provide an invaluable boost to the design of new drugs urgently needed to overcome developing drug resistance. Previous studies (6Foley M. Deady L.W. Ng K. Cowman A.F. Tilley L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6955-6961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Menting J.G.T. Tilley L. Deady L.W. Ng K.

In this study we have shown that CQ acts as a modest competitive inhibitor of the enzyme and have determined the first structure of a complex between chloroquine and an enzyme. Although we remain cautious of the importance of pfLDH inhibition in the overall efficacy of CQ, the structure of this complex demonstrates that specific targeting of this important glycolytic enzyme from the parasite should be feasible. Structure-based drug design studies incorporating this template could lead to the production of new forms of efficient pfLDH inhibitors as antimalarials."

Parental and CEM/Mtx-1 cells expressed identical levels of the 3.1-kilobase RFC transcript. A ∼85-kDa RFC protein was detected in parental cells by photoaffinity labeling and on Western blots with RFC-specific antiserum. In CEM/Mtx-1 cells, RFC protein was undetectable. By reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, G to A point mutations were identified in CEM/Mtx-1 transcripts at positions 130 (P1; changes glycine 44 → arginine) and 380 (P2; changes serine 127 → asparagine). A 4-base pair (CATG) insertion detected at position 191 (in 19–30% of cDNA clones) resulted in a frameshift and early translation termination. Wild-type RFC was also detected (0–9% of clones). Wild-type RFC and double-mutated RFC (RFCP1+P2) cDNAs were transfected into transport-impaired K562 and Chinese hamster ovary cells. Although RFC transcripts paralleled wild-type protein, for the RFCP1+P2 transfectants, disproportionately low RFCP1+P2 protein was detected. This reflected an increased turnover of RFCP1+P2 over wild-type RFC. RFCP1+P2 did not restore methotrexate transport; however, uptake was partially restored by constructs with single mutations at the P1 or P2 loci. Cumulatively, our results show that loss of transport function in CEM/Mtx-1 cells results from complete loss of RFC protein due to early translation termination and increased turnover of a mutant RFC protein.

To reach its intracellular target, dihydrofolate reductase, the preferred route of Mtx entry involves the reduced folate carrier (RFC; 1, 2). RFC transport of Mtx is critical to drug action because of its role in generating sufficient unbound intracellular antifolate to sustain maximal enzyme inhibition (1Goldman I.D. Matherly L.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 28: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, high levels of Mtx are also necessary for the synthesis of Mtx polyglutamates (1Goldman I.D. Matherly L.H. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 28: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Defective membrane transport of Mtx by RFC has been identified as a major mechanism of Mtx resistance (1Goldman I.D.

Transport alterations can manifest as reduced rates of carrier translocation (reducedV max), decreased affinities for transport substrates (increased K t), or both, and may involve decreased levels of normal RFC (6Wong S.C.

For instance, in Mtx-resistant K562 (K500E) cells, impaired Mtx transport is accompanied by decreased RFC transcripts and protein (6Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A G to A transition at position 890 of the murine RFC cDNA resulted in a substitution of serine 297 by asparagine and a selective decrease in Mtx binding affinity (∼4-fold) without effects on other antifolate analogs (aminopterin, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin; Ref. 9Roy K. Tolner B. Chiao J.H. Sirotnak F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2526-2531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Likewise, replacement of serine 46 by asparagine (10Zhao R. Assaraf Y.G. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7873-7879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) or glutamate 45 by lysine (11Zhao R. Assaraf Y. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19065-19071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) in murine RFC resulted in greater impairment of uptake for Mtx than (6S)-5-formyl tetrahydrofolate. In severely transport defective L1210 cells (MtxrA), loss of transport activity appeared to reflect a single (G to C) point mutation at nucleotide 429 of the murine RFC cDNA sequence which resulted in the substitution of proline 130 by alanine (7Brigle K.E. Spinella M.J. Sierra E.E. Goldman I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22974-22979Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, these cells also contained a wild-type RFC allele that was not transcribed. A silent wild-type RFC allele was described for Mtx-resistant MOLT-3 cells (MOLT-3/Mtx10,000; Ref. 8Gong M. Yess J. Connolly T. Ivy S.P. Ohnuma T. Cowan K.H. Moscow J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2494-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, two mutations in the RFC coding region were detected which resulted in the creation of new stop codons and synthesis of truncated nonfunctional RFCs (8Gong M. Yess J. Connolly T. Ivy S.P. Ohnuma T. Cowan K.H. Moscow J.A. Blood. 1997; 89: 2494-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the transport-impaired phenotype (∼3% of wild-type) of Mtx-resistant (∼243-fold) CCRF-CEM (CEM/Mtx-1;12) cells were examined. We show that although the levels of RFC transcripts are essentially unchanged from wild-type cells, there is a complete loss of RFC protein due to early translation termination and increased turnover of a double mutant RFC protein. The residual transport activity previously described in this transport-impaired line (12Matherly L.H. Angeles S.M. McGuire J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) presumably reflects extremely low levels of wild-type RFC and/or, possibly, non-RFC modes of Mtx uptake (13Sirotnak F.M.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3420-3426PubMed Google Scholar) and clonal lines (designated CEM-4 and CEM/Mtx-1 for the parental and Mtx-resistant cells, respectively) were used for all experiments. Transport-deficient K500E cells were selected from wild-type K562 cells by cloning in soft agar with 500 nm Mtx (6Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). K500E cells were transfected with wild-type RFC (KS43) to generate the K43-1 and K43-6 sublines, as described previously (6Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium as described previously (6Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A.

Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), were a gift of Dr. Wayne Flintoff (London, Ontario, Canada). Cells were grown in α-minimal essential medium with 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The pC43/10 CHO line was derived from MtxRIIOuaR2-4 cells by transfection with the full-length human RFC cDNA (KS43; Ref. 21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). CHO cells were grown as monolayers for transfection and general maintenance; for transport experiments, cells were grown in suspension in spinner flasks. Genomic DNAs were isolated from cultured cells using the PuregeneTM DNA isolation kit from Gentra Biosystem, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Aliquots (10 μg) were digested with restriction enzymes (either BamHI orHindIII), fractionated on a 0.6% agarose gel, and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Genescreen Plus, DuPont), following standard protocols (22Maniatis T. Fritsh E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from log phase cells using the TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA samples were analyzed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel, exactly as described previously (21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Equal loading was established by probing with 32P-labeled β-actin cDNA or by staining with ethidium bromide. All membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled full-length RFC cDNA and processed as described previously (21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17468-17475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). RFC cDNAs from parental and CEM/Mtx-1 cells were synthesized from total RNA with random hexamers using a RT-PCR kit from Perkin-Elmer. Four sets of PCR primers were used to generate overlapping partial cDNAs spanning the entire RFC coding region. The PCR primers for RFC cDNA amplification are shown in Table I. PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (35 cycles), and ending with 72 °C for 7 min (1 cycle). PCR products were subcloned into the pCR 2.1 plasmid using the T-A cloning kit (Invitrogen) and the nucleotide sequences were determined by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (23Sanger F. Niklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52503) Google Scholar).

Genomic fragments containing point mutations identified in the CEM/Mtx-1 cDNAs were PCR amplified and the PCR products subcloned and sequenced as described above. Primers for genomic amplification were based on the human RFC cDNA (21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

Acta. 1998; 1442: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) nucleotide sequences. For amplifying the fragment containing the P1mutation, a nested PCR approach was used. In the primary PCR reaction, two RFC intron-specific primers, RFC-IP1 (5′-ctgcagaccatcttccaaggtgccctga; upstream of the splice acceptor site at −49) and RFC-IP2 (5′-gcagaccatcttccaaggtgccctga; downstream of the splice donor site at 189), were used. For the secondary nested PCR reaction, the primers used were the exon-specific primer P8 (Table I) and another intron-specific primer RFC-IP3 (5′-acctactggtgctgctgcccctgc; downstream of the splice donor site at 189). The fragment containing the P2 mutation was amplified with intron-specific RFC-IP4 (5′-gcggcagcattgctaacacctggtg; upstream of the splice acceptor site at 190) and exon-specific P7 (Table I) primers. PCR conditions for amplifying genomic DNAs were 94 °C for 10 s, 63 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 60 s (35 cycles), and 1 cycle of 72 °C for 7 min. Constructs containing the P1 (RFCP1) or P2(RFCP2) mutations were prepared by restriction digesting CEM/Mtx-1 RFC mutant cDNAs with Eco72/ApaI (for P1) or NcoI/ApaI (for P2). The fragments were subcloned intoEco72/ApaI- orNcoI/ApaI-digested wild-type (KS43) RFC in pBluescript SK(−) (21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

The mutated RFC cDNAs were excised withBamHI and XhoI, and the ∼2-kb fragments subcloned into a BamHI/XhoI-digested pCDNA3 expression vector. The construct containing bothP1 and P2 mutations (RFCP1+P2) was prepared by ligating the Eco72/ApaI RFCP1 fragment intoEco72/ApaI-digested RFCP2 in pCDNA3. Mutant constructs were transfected into transport defective MtxRIIOuaR2-4 and K500E cells as described previously (6Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem.

G418-resistant clones were expanded and screened for RFC transcripts (Northern), immunoreactive RFC protein (Western), and [3H]Mtx uptake. The complete coding sequence of the KS43 RFC cDNA (21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

Following transformation of Escherichia coli (BL21) cells and induction by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (0.5 mm) for 4 h at room temperature, GST-RFC fusion proteins were purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech), as recommended by the manufacturer. Authenticity and purity of the purified RFC fusion protein were confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western analysis with anti-GST (Pharmacia Biotech) and RFC peptide-specific (RFC/ps; Ref. 26Wong S.C. Zhang L. Proefke S.A. Hukku B. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1135-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) antibodies. Anti-GST-RFC antiserum was raised in rabbits using purified GST-RFC fusion protein as antigen (Pocono Rabbit Farms and Laboratories, Canadensis, PA). Both immune and preimmune sera were purified on protein A-agarose columns prior to use (27Harlowe E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Plasma membranes were prepared by differential centrifugation (19Matherly L.H. Czajkowski C.A. Angeles S.M.

Plasma membrane purity and endoplasmic reticulum contamination of crude particulate and sucrose density gradient-purified membranes were established by 5′-nucleotidase (29Bodansky T. Schwartz M.K. J.

Membrane proteins were electrophoresed on 7.5% gels in the presence of SDS (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (DuPont) for detection with protein A-purified GST-RFC antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL). A few experiments employed RFC peptide-specific (RFC/ps) antibody (26Wong S.C. Zhang L. Proefke S.A. Hukku B. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1135-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Light emission was recorded on x-ray film with various exposure times, and the signal was analyzed with a computing densitometer and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For some experiments, the heterogeneously glycosylated RFCs were enzymatically deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F (Boehringer Mannheim), as described previously (6Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A.

Cell surface RFC proteins in wild-type CCRF-CEM and CEM/Mtx-1 cells (1 × 108 cells/labeling condition) were photoaffinity labeled usingN α-(4-amino-4-deoxy-10-methylpteroyl)-N ε-(4-azido-5-[125I]iodosalicylyl)-l-lysine (APA-[125I]ASA-Lys), as described previously (6Wong S.C.

Specificity of labeling was established by performing identical incubations in the presence of 100 μm aminopterin. Equal aliquots of labeled proteins were electrophoresed on a 4–10% gradient gel in the presence of SDS (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Initial [3H]Mtx uptake rates were determined over 180 s using 1–2 × 107 cells/ml (6Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem.

The levels of intracellular radioactivity were expressed as picomoles/mg of protein, calculated from direct measurements of radioactivity and protein contents of the cell homogenates. Protein assays were by the method of Lowry et al. (32Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic constants (K tand V max) were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Impaired Mtx Transport in CEM/Mtx-1 Cells Is Independent of Changes in RFC Transcripts or Gene Structure—Northern analysis of total RNAs from parental CCRF-CEM (CEM-4) and Mtx-resistant CEM/Mtx-1 cells showed that essentially identical levels of a major 3.1-kb RFC mRNA transcript were expressed (Fig.1) despite a ∼33-fold difference in relative Mtx transport (12Matherly L.H. Angeles S.M. McGuire J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although a 1-kb RNA species hybridized with the RFC cDNA in parental cells and a unique 9.5-kb band was detected in CEM/Mtx-1 cells (Fig. 1), the significance of these forms is not clear. These bands were still present even when poly(A) mRNAs were used for Northern analysis (data not shown). Restriction analysis (BamHI or HindIII) of genomic DNAs from CEM-4 and CEM/Mtx-1 cells did not reveal any major alterations in RFC gene organization or copy number between the lines (data not shown). Expression of RFC protein in plasma membranes from parental and CEM/Mtx-1 cells was analyzed by Western blotting using antibody to recombinant RFC fusion protein (GST-RFC) and chemiluminescence detection, and by photoaffinity labeling with APA-[125I]ASA-Lys (6Wong S.C. McQuade R. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

For both methods, a broadly migrating RFC band centered at ∼85 kDa was identified in parental cells (Fig. 2,left panel, and Fig. 3, respectively). Identical results were obtained on Western blots with peptide-specific (RFC/ps) antiserum (not shown). Slight differences were seen in the relative migrations for RFC, reflecting the different gel systems used for separation (7.5% for the Westernversus 4–10% for the photoprobe experiments). By both approaches, the major bands identified as RFC were converted to a single ∼65-kDa deglycosylated form by treatment withN-glycosidase F (shown for the immunoblotted RFC in parental CCRF-CEM cells; Fig. 2, right panel). This is the size predicted from the RFC cDNA sequence (21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J. Biol.

By contrast, in CEM/Mtx-1 cells none of the ∼85-kDa RFC protein was detected either by Western blotting with anti-GST-RFC (Fig. 2) or peptide-specific antiserum (not shown), or by photoaffinity labeling with APA-[125I]ASA-Lys (Fig. 3). However, an unidentified 42-kDa protein was specifically labeled with the photoprobe (Fig. 3). Although there were no changes in the background staining on Western blots following treatment of CEM/Mtx-1 proteins withN-glycosidase F, the 42-kDa photolabeled band was converted to ∼37 kDa by this treatment (not shown).Figure 3Photoaffinity labeling of RFC. Equal numbers (1 × 108) of parental CCRF-CEM (CEM-4) and CEM/Mtx-1 cells were labeled with APA-[125I]ASA-Lys in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 100 μm aminopterin (AMT) at 0 °C.

Four primer sets were used to amplify the entire RFC coding sequence (P1/P3, P4/P7, P8/P7, and P9/P10; TableI). Three alterations were identified in a 572-bp segment (positions −23 to 549, where 1 is the translational start site) amplified from CEM/Mtx-1 cells by primer set P7/P8 and encoding the RFC amino terminus. These include two G to A point mutations at positions 130 (designated P1; nucleotide position 1 is the translation start) and 380 (P2) in all of the 16 CEM/Mtx-1 clones sequenced, and a 4-bp (CATG) insertion at position 191 in 3 of the clones. By contrast, none of the 9 cDNA clones amplified with P7/P8 from parental CCRF-CEM cells contained any alterations from wild-type RFC sequence (21Wong S.C. Proefke S.A. Bhushan A. Matherly L.H. J.

This effect is isoform-specific and is not observed with S100A1, S100A6, or calmodulin. Using truncated p53 proteins in the N-terminal (p531–320) and C-terminal (p5373–393) domains, we localized the S100B-binding region to the C-terminal region of p53. We have confirmed a calcium-dependent interaction of the S100B with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal region of p53 (residues 319–393 in human p53) using plasmon resonance experiments on a BIAcore system. In the presence of calcium, the equilibrium affinity of the S100B for the C-terminal region of p53 immobilized on the sensor chip was 24 ± 10 nm. To narrow down the region within p53 involved in S100B binding, two synthetic peptides, O1357–381 (residues 357–381 in mouse p53) and YF-O2320–346 (residues 320–346 in mouse p53), covering the C-terminal region of p53 were compared for their interaction with purified S100B. Only YF-O2 peptide interacts with S100B with high affinity. The YF-O2 motif is a critical determinant for the thermostability of p53 and also corresponds to a domain responsible for cytoplasmic sequestration of p53.

Heizmann C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by highly conserved helix-loop-helix calcium-binding domains, known as EF-hand motifs. The S100B is found in astroglial cells in the central nervous system but also in a number of tissues outside the nervous system, including adipose tissue, testis, skin, and lymphocytes (2Takahashi K. Isobe T. Ohtsuki Y. Sonobe H. Takeda I. Akagi T. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 116: 497-503PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured cells, synthesis of S100B is tightly regulated and is maximum in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (3Fan K. Brain Res. 1982; 237: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Marks A.

A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) has been demonstrated. The identification of S100B target proteins is essential to better understand the mechanisms underlying S100B functions. Like calmodulin, S100B is likely to regulate multiple target proteins.The tumor suppressor p53 protein (17Levine A.J. Momand J. Finlay C.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3642) Google Scholar) is a putative intracellular target for the S100B protein. In vitro, S100B binds to p53 and inhibits p53 aggregation and phosphorylation by PKC (16Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar).1 S100B also binds to a peptide derived from the extreme C-terminal end of p53 (12Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A functional interaction between S100B and p53 was recently demonstrated in p53-negative mouse embryo fibroblasts by sequential transfection with the S100B and temperature-sensitive p53val135 genes (5Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In mouse embryo fibroblast cells expressing a low level of p53val135, S100B cooperates with calcium in triggering p53val135-dependent cell growth arrest and death at the nonpermissive temperature (37.5 °C). Activation of wild type p53 functions by S100B correlated with nuclear accumulation of p53val135 under a wild type conformation. S100B modulation of p53val135 functions was confirmed in the rat embryo fibroblast (REF) cell line clone 6, which is transformed by oncogenic Ha-ras and overexpression of p53val135 (19Michalovitz D. Halevy O. Oren M. Cell. 1990; 62: 671-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression of S100B in clone 6 cells reverts transformed phenotypes and restores wild type p53 activities at 37.5 °C (5Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that S100B could either inactivate the mutant p53val135 species and/or favor folding of the p53val135 under a wild type conformation (5Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The functional activity of the p53val135 mutant is associated with its conformational flexibility (20Milner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 49-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). At the nonpermissive temperature (37.5 °C), the temperature-sensitive p53val135 mutant folds into an inactive mutant conformational form, detectable by the monoclonal antibody PAb240. At the permissive temperature, the p53val135 protein adopts a wild type conformation detectable by the monoclonal antibody PAb246 and is functionally active (i.e. able to specifically bind DNA and to activate transcription). The conformational flexibility that characterizes the temperature-sensitive p53val135 mutant is not unique to this mutation and could be representative of the conformational flexibility that also characterizes wild type p53 (20Milner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 49-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,21Milner J. Medcalf E.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 765-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In vivo, conformational shift between the wild type and mutant conformations (recognized by the monoclonal antibodies PAb246 and PAb240, respectively) has been observed during embryonic differentiation of embryonic stem cells (22Sabapathy K. Klemm M. Jaenisch R. Wagner E.F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6217-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In vitro, wild type conformation of Escherichia coli expressed recombinant p53 can be allosterically regulated for stabilization by two regulatory sites found within the N and C termini of the molecule to which ligands may bind (23Hansen S. Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3917-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A major challenge now is to characterize the domain on p53 associated with conformational shift and to identify the cellular co-factors that may govern the conformational switch controlling p53 activity (20Milner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 49-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).In this report, we show that the S100B protein interacts with baculovirus recombinant p53 and protects p53 from thermal denaturation. We also identify a high affinity S100B-binding domain within p53 called YF-O2 (residues 320–346 in mouse p53). This domain constitutes a critical determinant for the stability and oligomerization status of p53 (24Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Mateu M.G. Fersht A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26Hansen S. Midgley C.A.

It corresponds to the minimal region of the C terminus that confers thermal instability to p53 (25Mateu M.G. Fersht A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and also corresponds to a domain responsible for cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 (27Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONIn the first part of this study, we have confirmed that baculovirus recombinant wild type p53 is highly sensitive to thermal denaturation (16Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Temperature-dependent denaturation of p53 is linked to protein aggregation (16Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11627-11631Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) and compromised DNA binding activity of p53 (Fig. 2 A). The interaction of S100B with recombinant wild type p53 protects p53 from thermal denaturation (16; Fig. 2, B and C). Secondly, we have confirmed a specific and strict calcium-dependent interaction of the S100B with a synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal region of p53 (residues 319–393 in human p53) by plasmon resonance measurement experiments. We have also identified the YF-O2 peptide as part of a high affinity S100B-binding site within the C-terminal region of p53. Structural studies have shown that the YF-O2 sequence is a critical domain for p53 thermostability (24Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Mateu M.G. Fersht A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is likely that interaction of S100B with YF-O2 peptide on p53 is directly responsible for the increased resistance of p53 to thermal denaturation. Like S100B, theE. coli heat shock protein DnaK has been shown to bind to the C terminus of p53 and protect p53 from thermal denaturation (23Hansen S. Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3917-3924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar,26Hansen S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Freemann B.C. Morimoto R. Hupp T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30922-30928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). S100B is the first mammalian protein to share this property with DnaK.The YF-O2 peptide on p53 is involved in the dimerization and in subsequent tetramerization of p53 dimers (28Sakamoto H.

Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar). TheK d value found for the tetramer-monomer transition of the C-terminal domain of p53 was determined to be 1–10 μm (28Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Kodama H. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8974-8978Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 35Sakaguchi K. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Anderson C.W. Erickson J.W. Appella E. Xie D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10117-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Because of the high K dvalue, it has been proposed that in normal, undamaged cells, when the cytoplasmic p53 concentration is very low, p53 may be largely monomeric (35Sakaguchi K. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Anderson C.W. Erickson J.W. Appella E. Xie D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10117-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However in its monomeric state, the p53 molecule is thermodynamically unstable relative to the tetramer (24Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 25Mateu M.G. Fersht A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2748-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The high equilibrium affinity of the S100B for the C-terminal domain immobilized on the sensor chip (K d 24 ± 10 nm) suggests that S100B could transiently interact with cytoplasmic p53 monomer to stabilize the p53 in a native conformation prior to nuclear translocation. Once p53 has translocated to the cell nuclei, it may be stabilized through its interactions with DNA targets as a tetramer. The idea that S100B could be involved in conformational modulation and stabilization of p53 monomer into a native (wild type) conformation is supported by in vivo observations (5Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In mouse embryo fibroblast cells expressing low levels of the temperature-sensitive p53val135 mutant, S100B cooperates with calcium in stabilization and activation of the wild type p53val135 conformational species at the nonpermissive temperature (37.5 °C) (5Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The YF-O2 sequence on p53 also corresponds to a “cytoplasmic sequestration domain” (27Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hence, one can envision that in response to intracellular calcium elevation, S100B could also dissociate the interaction between p53 and cytoplasmic anchoring proteins to favor p53 nuclear translocation. It is noteworthy that in mouse embryo fibroblast cells expressing S100B and the p53val135, calcium-mediated stabilization of the p53val135 under a wild type conformation is also associated with wild type p53val135 nuclear accumulation (5Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The involvement of calcium signaling and S100B in activation of wild type p53 probably not only concern the p53val135 mutant but could be of more general occurrence. Intracellular calcium elevation is induced in physiological stimulation known to activate p53 functions, including cell contact (38Yahanda A.M. Bruner J.M. Donehower L.A. Morrison R.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4249-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and hypoxia associated with tumor formation (39Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 379: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 40Graeber T.G. Osmanian C. Jacks T. Housman D.E. Koch C.J. Lowe S.W. Giaccia A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). S100B, which is normally expressed at low levels in proliferating glial cells or in peripheral tissues, is also strongly induced by such stimulations. For examples, in C6 glial cells, S100B synthesis correlates with G1 phase growth arrest at confluence (5Scotto C. Deloulme J.C. Rousseau D. Chambaz E. Baudier J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, S100B is induced in response to hypoxia (41Tsoporis J.N. Marks A. Kahn H.J. Butany J. Liu P.P. O'Hanlon D. Parker T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31915-31921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This last observation also suggests that overexpression of S100B generally observed in brain tumors and peripheral tumors (42Nakajima T. Watanabe S. Sato Y. Kameya T. Hirota T. Shimosato Y. Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 1982; 6: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 43Van Eldik L.J. Jensen R.A. Ehrenfried B.A. Whetsell W.O. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1986; 34: 977-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) could be linked to hypoxia during tumor formation (39Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 379: 19-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that in normal cells and also in tumor cells S100B induction could also be associated with p53 activation.Finally, the high affinity S100B-binding domain within p53 that we identified also corresponds to the minimal transforming domain on mutant p53 (Ref. 44Shaulian E. Zauberman A. Ginsberg D. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5581-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar and Fig. 3). Overexpression of the transforming C-terminal p53 mini-protein harboring YF-O2 domain cooperates with theras oncogene in cell transformation in the absence of endogenous wild type p53 (45Shaulian E. Haviv I. Shaul Y. Oren M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 671-680PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that YF-O2-mediated transformation operates via stable interaction and inactivation of p53 target proteins. Because ectopic expression of S100B in a REF cell line overexpressing ras and the p53val135 is able to revert transformed phenotypes of the cells, it would be worth investigating whether S100B could also dissociate interactions between YF-O2 and target proteins.The K d value found for the interaction between S100B and the p53319–393 peptide (24 nm) is in the same range as that reported for the interaction between the S100A1 and the basic helix-loop-helix peptide of MyoD (20 nm) (32Baudier J. Bergeret E. Bertacchi N. Weintraub H. Gagnon J. Garin J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7834-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Hermann S. Saarikettu J. Onions J. Hughes K. Grundström T.

A conserved amino acid sequence exists within the YF-O2 sequence of p53 (344LNEALELK351) that is implicated in S100B binding and the helix I motif within myogenic transcription factor MyoD (124VNEAFETLK132) involved in S100A1 binding. These two motifs are involved in the regulation of p53 and MyoD cellular localization (27Liang S.H. Hong D. Clarke M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19817-19821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 46Vandromme M. Cavadore J.C. Bonnieu A. Froeschlé A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The identification of a putative S100 target consensus motif within p53 and MyoD with functional homologies suggests that regulation of nuclear translocation of transcription factors associated with negative cell growth regulation may be a general feature of S100 proteins function. It is interesting to note that interaction of S100B and S100A1 with an other nuclear protein, the Ndr protein kinase, has recently been characterized (15Millward T.A. Heizmann C.W. Schäfer B.W. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It would be interesting to study the possible contribution of S100 proteins in Ndr protein kinase nuclear translocation. Despite the strong amino acid sequence homology between the YF-O2 sequence on p53 and the helix I motif on MyoD, the interaction between p53319–393 peptide and S100B is isoform-specific (Fig. 4 C). Such specificity suggests that in addition to the consensus sequence, other amino acids adjacent to that motif could be responsible for the specificity of interaction between S100B and p53. Weber's group (12Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recently reported that S100B binds to a basic peptide derived from the extreme C-terminal basic tail of human p53 (residues 367–388), which corresponds to the O1 peptide. The high dissociation constant for this interaction (K d = 20 μm) (12Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 18Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) would explain why we have not been able to detect interaction of this peptide with S100B (Fig. 5). In our experimental conditions, the low S100B concentration used (4 μm) was probably not sufficient to reveal low affinity interaction. It is nevertheless possible that O1 domain contribute to strengthen the interaction of S100B dimer with the full-length C-terminal region of p53. The possible implication of O1 in S100B binding to p53319–393 peptide may explain why analysis of the kinetics of interactions between S100B and p53319–393 immobilized on the sensor chip cannot be analyzed with a single interaction site model at high S100B concentration. Although O1 peptide is not involved in p53 dimerization and tetramerization (24Johnson C.R. Morin P.E. Arrowsmith C.H. Freire E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5309-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S. Kodama H. Appella E. Sakaguchi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Science. 1994; 265: 386-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), this domain is nevertheless required for formation of higher oligomeric aggregates (37Sturzbecher H.W. Brain R. Addison C. Rugbe K. Remm M. Grimaldi M. Keenan E. Jenkins J.R. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1513-1523PubMed Google Scholar) and is engaged in transient interchain interaction with another domain within the protein tetramer (35Sakaguchi K. Sakamoto H. Lewis M.S.

Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). It is likely that, in addition to its effect on wild type p53 stabilization, S100B could also affect an important protein interaction at the C-terminal domain involving O1 domain. The S100 family is one of the largest subfamily of calcium-binding proteins that are thought to play roles in mediating calcium signals during cell growth, differentiation, and motility (reviewed in Ref. 1Schäfer B.W. Heizmann C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). These proteins are characterized by highly conserved helix-loop-helix calcium-binding domains, known as EF-hand motifs. The S100B is found in astroglial cells in the central nervous system but also in a number of tissues outside the nervous system, including adipose tissue, testis, skin, and lymphocytes (2Takahashi K. Isobe T. Ohtsuki Y. Sonobe H. Takeda I. Akagi T. Am. J. Pathol. 1984; 116: 497-503PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured cells, synthesis of S100B is tightly regulated and is maximum in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (3Fan K. Brain Res. 1982; 237: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 4Marks A.

Dynamin self-assembles into helical collars around the necks of coated pits and other membrane invaginations and mediates membrane scission. In vitro, dynamin has been reported to exist as dimers, tetramers, ring-shaped oligomers, and helical polymers. In this study we sought to define self-assembly regions in dynamin. Deletion of two closely spaced sequences near the dynamin-1 C terminus abolished self-association as assayed by co-immunoprecipitation and the yeast interaction trap, and reduced the sedimentation coefficient from 7.5 to 4.5 S. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and equilibrium ultracentrifugation of synthetic peptides revealed coiled-coil formation within the C-terminal assembly domain and at a third, centrally located site. Two of the peptides formed tetramers, supporting a role for each in the monomer-tetramer transition and providing novel insight into the organization of the tetramer. Partial deletions of the C-terminal assembly domain reversed the dominant inhibition of endocytosis by dynamin-1 GTPase mutants. Self-association was also observed between different dynamin isoforms. Taken altogether, our results reveal two distinct coiled-coil-containing assembly domains that can recognize other dynamin isoforms and mediate endocytic inhibition.

Ligands that bind to the proline-rich domain stimulate both assembly and GTP hydrolysis, and removal of the domain inhibits both activities (13Tuma P.L. Stachniak M.C. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17240-17246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D.

A. 1993; 90: 11468-11472Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). More recently, proteolytic dynamin fragments missing the proline-rich domain were shown by electron microscopy to be capable of self-assembly when in the presence of GDP and metallofluorides at physiological salt conditions (27Carr J.F. Hinshaw J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28030-28035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) or on lipid bilayer tubes (11Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The role of the putative coiled-coil sequences in dynamin self-association is uncertain. Coiled-coil probability is only ∼60% (see “Results”), and whether this region actually forms coiled-coil structure, amphipathic α-helix, or neither is uncertain. This region is conserved among the dynamin isoforms and dynamin-related proteins (4Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), and computer-based analysis (Newcoils; Ref. 28Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar) predicts comparable secondary structure in all of these proteins. The dynamin-related Mx proteins exhibit clear heptad repeats within this region consistent with a leucine zipper structure that, when fused to a reporter gene, was capable of self-association (29Melén K. Ronni T. Broni B. Krug R.M. von Bonsdorff C.-H. Julkunen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25898-25907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A potential role for the putative coiled-coil region of dynamin emerged from our previous analysis of the inhibitory endocytic phenotype in mammalian cells transiently transfected with a dominant negative, C-terminal deletion mutant (30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 31Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Inhibition was unaffected by removal of the proline-rich domain but was reversed by further deletion into the putative coiled-coil region, suggesting that this part of the molecule might mediate the interaction of mutant dynamin with the endogenous wild-type protein (31Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism underlying the inhibitory phenotype and to understand the mechanism of dynamin self-association, we have used a series of deletion mutants to define sites of dynamin self-association and identify two distinct regions. Analysis of peptides reveals that at least three sequences in dynamin-1 are capable of self-association. These results suggest a critical role for the coiled-coil region in dynamin self-assembly. The dynamin-1ab isoform (1Obar R.A. Collins C.A. Hammarback J.A. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1990; 347: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) was used for most experiments. C-terminal and internal deletion mutants were made via polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector, pSVL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Polymerase chain reaction was also used to fuse the HA (32Field J. Nikawa J.-I. Brock D. MacDonald B. Rodgers K. Wilson I. Learner R. Wigler M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2159-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar) or Myc epitope (33Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) to the N terminus, and all constructs were sequenced to ascertain that the mutations and epitope tags were correct. The dynamin-2bb isoform (31Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) was also Myc-tagged at the N-terminal end using polymerase chain reaction. For the co-immunoprecipitation assays, COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with both HA- and Myc-tagged dynamin-1 constructs using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as directed by the manufacturer. Cytosolic extracts of the co-expressed proteins were prepared by lysing the transfected cells in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and clearing the lysates at 30,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min to remove any cellular debris. After preclearing the supernatants with protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for several hours, fresh protein A beads were added along with either anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Babco, Berkeley, CA) or anti-Myc polyclonal antibody (a gift of Dr. Melissa Gee, University of Mass. Medical School, Worcester, MA). Co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out overnight at 4 °C with end-over-end rotation, after which the beads were washed several times in NET gel buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.25% gelatin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) and then resuspended in an equal volume of SDS sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western analysis was done using either the HA monoclonal antibody (Babco) or the Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10, ATCC), and chemiluminescence was used to detect any protein interactions (Kirkgaard and Perry Laboratories). The LexA-based interaction trap (34Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Erica Golemis (Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadephia, PA) and used to assay for dynamin-dynamin interactions in yeast. Wild-type dynamin-1 was subcloned into the JG202 bait expression vector, which contains a nuclear localization signal. Wild-type and deletion mutants of dynamin were constructed in the JG4-5 prey vector. We tested the suitability of the wild-type dynamin-1 in JG202 as bait and found that it did not activate transcription alone. The lithium acetate method was used to make yeast competent cells and for transformations (35$$Google Scholar). Dynamin-dynamin interactions were scored positive if transcription of the lacZ and LEU2 reporter genes were activated. Sucrose density gradients (5–20%) were prepared in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl buffer. Cytosolic extracts of COS cells transfected with Myc-tagged dynamin constructs were prepared as described above. For each gradient, 500 μg of the extract and 10 μg of each molecular mass marker (Sigma) were loaded. Centrifugation was at 26,500 rpm and 4 °C for 17 h. Fractions were collected at 20-s intervals and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Detection of dynamin was by chemiluminescence using a Myc monoclonal antibody. The positions of the molecular mass markers in the gradients were detected by Coomassie stain. Densitometric measurements were made on a Bio-Rad model GS-700 Imaging Densitometer scanner interfaced to the Bio-Rad Multi-analyst computer program (version 1.1). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and the S values for the markers are as follows: bovine serum albumin, 4.5 S; alcohol dehydrogenase, 7.5 S; β-amylase, 9 S. Transferrin uptake was measured in COS cells as described previously (30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After transient transfection of the cells with Myc-tagged dynamin constructs, the cells were grown in serum-free medium for 24 h. Transferrin endocytosis was then stimulated by adding 20 μg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled transferrin (Molecular Probes) for 10 min at 37 °C, after which uptake was stopped by placing the cells on ice and washing several times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and subsequently extracted with either ice-cold methanol for 5 min or 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 min. Cell staining was done as described previously (30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), and immunofluorescent imaging was with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Synthetic peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis methodology using a 4-benzylhydrylamine hydrochloride resin with conventionalN-t-butyloxycarbonyl chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer as described by Seredaet al. (36Sereda T.J. Mant C.T. Quinn A.M. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1993; 646: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Peptides were cleaved from the resin by reaction with hydrogen fluoride (20 ml/g resin) containing 10% anisole and 2% 1,2-ethanedithiol for 1 h at −5 °C, washed with cold ether several times, extracted from the resin with glacial acetic acid, and then lyophilized. Purification of each peptide was performed by reversed-phase chromatography on a Syn-Chropak semi-preparative C-8 column (inner diameter, 250 × 10 mm; 6.5-μm particle size; 300-Å pore size; SynChrom, Lafayette, IN) with a linear AB gradient (ranging from 0.2 to 1.0% B/min) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, where solvent A is aqueous 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Homogeneity of the purified peptides was verified by analytical reversed-phase chromatography, amino acid analysis, and electrospray quadrapole mass spectrometry. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Inc.) interfaced to an Epson Equity 386/25 computer running the Jasco DP-500/PS2 system software (version 1.33a). The temperature-controlled cuvette holder was maintained at 20 °C with a Lauda model RMS circulating water bath. The instrument was calibrated with an aqueous solution of recrystallized d-10-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid at 290.5 nm. Results are expressed as the mean residue molar ellipticity [θ] (degrees·cm2·dmol−1) calculated from the following equation. [θ]=(θobs−M)/(10×l×c)Equation 1 where θobs is the observed ellipticity expressed in millidegrees, M is the mean residue molecular mass (molecular mass of the peptide divided by the number of amino acids),l is the optical path length in centimeters, andc is the final peptide concentration in mg/ml. The CD wave scans were measured from 190 to 255 nm in benign buffer (0.1m KCl, 0.05 m potassium phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7) at two peptide concentrations, 1 and 0.1 mm, unless otherwise noted in the text. For samples containing TFE, the above buffer was diluted 1:1 (v/v) with TFE. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was performed on a Beckman model XLI Analytical Ultracentrifuge and interference optics as described in the instrument manual (Beckman Instruments). Samples were dialyzed against and run in a 50 mm potassium phosphate, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7 buffer. Six-sector charcoal-filled epon sample cells were used, allowing three concentrations of sample to be run simultaneously. Runs were performed at two or three speeds between 20,000 and 32,000 rpm and were continued until there was no significant difference in scans taken 2 h apart. The data were evaluated using a nonlinear least squares curve-fitting algorithm (37Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophysics. 1981; 36: 575-588Scopus (778) Google Scholar) contained in the NonLin analysis program. The program Sednterp (Sedimentation Interpretation Program, version 1.01) was employed to calculate the partial specific volume of the protein from the amino acid composition as well as the solvent density and viscosity using known values from physical tables. As a first step in defining a self-association domain in dynamin-1, we tested for interactions between epitope-tagged dynamin-1 constructs co-expressed in COS cells. Full-length Myc- and HA-tagged wild-type dynamin-1 (C851; Fig. 1, A and B; see also Fig. 7) were observed to co-immunoprecipitate using antibody recognizing either epitope. Co-immunoprecipitation was still observed with C-terminal deletions that were lacking all or part of the proline-rich region (C750; Fig. 1, A and B; see also Fig. 7) as well as with mutants missing either the GTPase (N272; see Fig. 7) or the PH domain (ΔPH; Fig. 1 C; see also Fig.7). In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation was abolished by a C-terminal deletion which removed the second of the two potential coiled-coil forming segments (C695; Fig. 1, A and B; see also Fig. 7). Co-immunoprecipitation was also eliminated by internal deletions that removed the first of the two regions or both together (ΔCC1 or ΔCC12; Fig. 1 C; see also Fig. 7). These data suggested that the sequence between aa 654 and aa 741 containing the two regions may represent an important self-assembly domain.Figure 7Summary of the mapping results.Schematic representation summarizing the cDNA constructs used to map the C-terminal self-assembly region by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), yeast two-hybrid (2-Hybrid), and sucrose density gradients (S-value). ++, very good interaction; +, good interaction; +/−, detectable interaction; −, no interaction;Pro-rich, proline-rich domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As an alternative approach to defining interaction sites, we also used a yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions were assayed between a wild-type dynamin-1 bait and a panel of dynamin-1 deletion mutant prey constructs. In agreement with the co-immunoprecipitation results, dynamin-1 preys that were missing part of the proline-rich region still interacted with the wild-type dynamin-1 bait (C761; Fig.2; see also Fig. 7), although deletion of the entire proline-rich region resulted in little, if any, interaction (C750; Fig. 2; see also Fig. 7). We also detected a reduction in interaction intensity with a C-terminal deletion mutant (C733; Fig. 2; see also Fig. 7) that had previously been shown to reverse the dominant negative endocytic effect of K44E (30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). As had been observed in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, interactions persisted in prey devoid of either the GTP-binding domain (N272; Fig. 2; see also Fig. 7) or the PH domain (ΔPH; Fig. 2; see also Fig. 7). C-terminal deletions missing some or all of the potential coiled- coil forming sequences resulted in no interaction with the full-length bait (C695, C648, and C514; Fig. 2; see also Fig. 7) as did partial or complete removal of the coiled-coil region between aa 654–741 (ΔCC1, ΔCC2, and ΔCC12; Fig. 2; see also Fig. 7), consistent with our co-immunoprecipitation data. These data were consistent with our hypothesis that dominant inhibitory dynamin polypeptides act through interaction with endogenous wild-type dynamin protein (30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To test this possibility directly, we assayed for transferrin uptake in cells overexpressing dominant negative dynamin-1 K44E mutants that also had deletions in the self-assembly region. Fig.3 shows that removal of either of the two self-association sequences identified in our co-immunoprecipitation and yeast interaction trap assays resulted in reversal of the dominant negative endocytic phenotype, i.e. the resumption of transferrin uptake. Because dynamin-1-K44E exhibits its inhibitory effects in cells containing primarily the dynamin-2 and dynamin-3 isoforms (30Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), we also tested for an interaction between isoforms. Interaction between dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 could be readily detected both by the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig.4 A) and by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Heterotypic interaction between the dynamin-1 and dynamin-2 isoforms. A, dynamin-2 (Dyn-2) bait was tested for an interaction with the dynamin-1 (Dyn-1) prey or with the JG4-5 vector as a control.

We established that the COS-expressed Myc-tagged dynamin-1 isoform behaved similarly to rat brain dynamin-1 in the sucrose density gradients (data not shown). Both ran as a 7.5 S peak, indicating that they were not in a highly assembled state under these conditions. The S value was unaffected by the removal of either the proline-rich (Fig. 5 A; see also Fig. 7) or PH domains (Fig. 5 B; see also Fig. 7). However, deletions involving the self-assembly region identified by our co-immunoprecipitation and yeast interaction trap experiments resulted in a shift of the 7.5 S peak to 4.5 S (C695; Fig. 5 A; see also Fig. 7; and ΔCC12; Fig. 5B; see also Fig. 7), consistent with dissociation to a smaller species. No such shift was produced by deletion to aa 733 (C733; Figs. 6 and7), which reverses the dominant inhibitory endocytic effect (31Okamoto P.M. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11629-11635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), despite removal of several amino acids from the C terminus of the self-assembly domain. However, partial dissociation was observed in a different gradient buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7, 50 mm KCl; Figs. 6 and 7). These results indicated a decrease in the affinity between polypeptides, although the ability to self-associate was not abolished completely.Figure 6Buffer-dependent dissociation of C733. The C-terminal dynamin-1 truncation construct C733 was analyzed in 5–20% sucrose density gradients containing either the standard gradient buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl) (A) or 20 mm Hepes, pH 7, 50 mm KCl (B).

To identify proteins possibly involved in this process, we performed affinity chromatography with the nNOS PDZ domain, a N-terminal motif that mediates protein interactions. Using this method to fractionate soluble tissue extracts, we identified the muscle isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK-M) as a protein that binds to nNOS both in brain and skeletal muscle. PFK-M interacts with the PDZ domain of nNOS, and nNOS-PFK-M binding can be competed by peptides that bind to the PDZ domain of nNOS. We found that nNOS is significantly associated with PFK-M in skeletal muscle because nNOS can be immunodepleted from cytosolic skeletal muscle extracts using an antibody directed against PFK-M. In brain, nNOS and PFK-M are both enriched in synaptosomes, and specifically, in the synaptic vesicle fraction, where they can interact. At the cellular level, PFK-M is enriched in neurons that express nNOS protein. As fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, the product of PFK activity, is neuroprotective, the interaction of nNOS and PFK may contribute to neuroprotection of nNOS positive cells.

Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). In the peripheral nervous system, NO mediates certain actions of autonomic motor neurons on smooth muscle and thereby NO regulates intestinal peristalsis and penile erection. In the central nervous system, NO does not primarily act on smooth muscle but instead modulates synaptic transmission associated with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) type glutamate receptors. By regulating synaptic plasticity, NO can influence hippocampal long term potentiation (3Son H. Hawkins R.D. Martin K. Kiebler M. Huang P.L. Fishman M.C. Kandel E.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1015-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) as well as aspects of learning (4Hawkins R.D. Neuron. 1996; 16: 465-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and memory (5Kendrick K.M. Guevara-Guzman R. Zorrilla J. Hinton M.R. Broad K.D. Mimmack M. Ohkura S. Nature. 1997; 388: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Although small amounts of NO mediate physiological signaling, excess NO production can cause tissue injury (6Samdani A.F. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Stroke. 1997; 28: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The primary stimulus for NO synthesis in central neurons is activation of NMDA receptors (2Garthwaite J. Boulton C.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 683-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Overactivity of NMDA receptors is implicated in numerous neurodegenerative processes including stroke, Huntington's chorea, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (7Lipton S.A. Rosenberg P.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar). A role for NO in NMDA-mediated degeneration was first suggested by experiments showing neuroprotection by NO synthase antagonists (8Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. London E.D. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6368-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (2112) Google Scholar). Definitive evidence that nNOS mediates brain injury derives from studies of nNOS knockout mice, which are strikingly resistant to excitotoxicity following focal cerebral ischemia (9Huang Z. Huang P.L. Panahian N. Dalkara T. Fishman M.C. Moskowitz M.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1883-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). NO can mediate neurotoxicity by inhibiting metabolic pathways and causing cellular energy depletion, which is a hallmark of ischemic injury-induced neuronal death. NO erodes energy stores by reacting with certain metabolic enzymes that contain heme-iron prosthetic groups, iron-sulfur clusters, or reactive thiols (10Stamler J.S. Cell. 1994; 78: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Through these reactions, NO can inhibit glycolysis by reacting with cis-aconitase and can attenuate oxidative phosphorylation by inhibiting mitochondrial iron-sulfur enzymes and by competing with oxygen at cytochrome oxidase (11Brown G.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar, 12Torres J. Darley-Usmar V. Wilson M.T. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Interestingly, nNOS-containing neurons are themselves relatively resistant to excitotoxic injury, suggesting that nNOS neurons have specific mechanisms that protect them from energy depletion associated with NO toxicity (13Dawson V.L. Kizushi V.M. Huang P.L. Snyder S.H. Dawson T.M. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because NO mediates critical physiological functions but can also be toxic, nNOS activity must be tightly regulated. Selective regulation of calmodulin-dependent nNOS by specific calcium pools is mediated by the targeting of nNOS to subcellular sites (14Brenman J.E. Bredt D.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In brain, nNOS is targeted to the synaptic membranes through interactions with postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and PSD-93 (15Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). PSD-95 and PSD-93 are major proteins of the postsynaptic density and bind to nNOS via PDZ (PSD-95, discs-large, ZO-1) domains, consensus sequences of approximately 100 amino acids found in some cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes that mediate protein-protein interactions (17Cho K.O.

The association of nNOS and PSD-95 is mediated by a direct PDZ-PDZ interaction (15Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PDZ domains from nNOS and PSD-95 can also interact with specific sequences at the C termini of target proteins (18Sheng M.

PSD-95 and PSD-93 also synaptically cluster NMDA receptors, which are glutamate-activated calcium channels (22Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

Neuron. 1996; 17: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). This macromolecular signaling complex is poised to regulate the synaptic activity of nNOS (14Brenman J.E. Bredt D.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). As nNOS occurs at both synaptic and nonsynaptic sites, we wondered whether other protein complexes might also bind the PDZ domain of nNOS. To address this, we performed affinity chromatography using a fusion protein column containing the PDZ domain of nNOS. Purification of brain lysates on this column yielded a protein band of approximately 80 kDa that was identified as an isoform of phosphofructokinase (PFK-M). Endogenous PFK-M is indeed associated with nNOS, and PFK-M and nNOS are both concentrated in a synaptic vesicle fraction from brain homogenates. At the cellular level, PFK-M is selectively enriched in cortical neurons that express nNOS. These data identify PFK as a major nNOS-interacting protein in brain cytosol. As PFK catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycolysis and the product of this reaction, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, is neuroprotective (24Sola A. Berrios M. Sheldon R.A. Ferriero D.M. Gregory G.A.

Peptides were from Research Genetics (Birmingham, AL). Glutathione-Sepharose and pGEX4T-1 vector were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Affi-Gel 10 beads were from Bio-Rad. Horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-guinea pig antibody was from Sigma. ECL reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Mouse antibody raised against nNOS was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Guinea pig antibody raised against rabbit PFK-M was generously provided by Dr. Robert G. Kemp, University of Chicago. All other reagents were from Sigma. A glutathione S-transferase fusion protein encoding the first 195 amino acids of nNOS was constructed by polymerase chain reaction and was expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli as described previously (16Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). For protein affinity chromatography studies, GST fusion proteins were not eluted from the beads. Purified GST fusion proteins were dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C for 16 h. Five mg of protein was cross-linked to 1 ml of Affi-Gel 10 by incubating in PBS + 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 16 h on a shaking platform. Affinity chromatography was performed as described previously (27Moazed D. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1996; 86: 667-677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) with modifications. GST- and GST-nNOS-(nNOS) Affi-Gel beads were incubated in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 350 mmNaCl on ice for 1 h. The affinity resin was then washed consecutively with Buffer C (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 125 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol) containing 1 mm DTT, Buffer C containing 1 mm DTT and 2.5 m urea, Buffer C containing 1 mm DTT and 4 m urea, and Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, 125 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). These washes precleared the columns of any unlinked GST fusion protein that might leach off of the Affi-Gel beads during incubation with brain extract. Bovine serum albumin-Affi-Gel 10 beads were constructed in a similar manner and were used to clear the extract prior to its application to the GST- and nNOS-Affi-Gel 10 to reduce the background binding of nonspecific proteins. Twenty-five adult rat brains were homogenized in ice-cold Buffer D, Triton X-100 (TX) was added to 1%, and proteins were extracted for 1 h at 4 °C. The homogenate was spun at 12,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant was precleared by incubating with 2 ml of bovine serum albumin-Affi-Gel 10 beads that were pre-washed with Buffer D at 4 °C for 2 h. The bovine serum albumin beads were removed, and 100 ml of extract was incubated with 0.5 ml of nNOS-Affi-Gel 10 at 4 °C for 3 h. As controls, 10 ml of extract was incubated with 50 μl of GST-Affi-Gel 10, and 10 ml of Buffer D containing 1% TX was incubated with 50 μl of nNOS-Affi-Gel 10. All incubations were done in batch. Extract/beads were then loaded into the appropriate size columns and were washed with 200 ml of Buffer D containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% TX, and 1 mm PMSF, and 100 ml Buffer D containing 1% TX (per 2 ml of beads). Proteins were eluted consecutively with 2.5 ml of Buffer D containing 1% TX, 2.5m urea twice and 2.5 ml Buffer D containing 1% TX and 4m urea, and finally 2.5 ml Buffer D containing 1% SDS. Each fraction was precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed twice with 1:1 ether ethanol, and resuspended in 50 μl 100 mm Tris 8.8, 1% SDS. Proteins were resolved by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized using silver. The 2.5m urea and 4 m urea fractions were combined, and proteins were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). The membrane was stained with Coomassie to visualize bands, the desired protein bands were excised, and protein sequencing was performed by ProSeq (Salem, MA). Proteins were cleaved with CNBr and were then coupled with O-phthalaldehyde as described previously (28Brauer A.W. Oman C.L. Margolies M.N. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). O-Phthalaldehyde treatment blocks all peptides that do not contain an N-terminal proline. Proteins were then sequenced by Edman degradation. The single peptide sequence was used to search the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the BLAST programs. One adult rat brain or 2.2 g or skeletal muscle was homogenized in 5 or 7.5 ml of TEE (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF), respectively. TX was added to a final concentration of 1%, and the homogenates were incubated on a rocking platform at 4 °C for 1 h. The extract was spun at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting brain supernatant was diluted 1:10 in TEE. 1 ml of brain or skeletal muscle extract was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-epharose bound to 50 μg of GST or GST-nNOS1–195 at 4 °C for 1 h. Extract/beads were loaded into the appropriate sized column and were washed three times with 20 ml TEE containing 0.2% TX. Bound proteins were eluted with 200 μl of 0.5% SDS and 100 mm NaCl, resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane as described above. Blots were probed using a guinea pig antibody raised against rabbit PFK-M and visualized using a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase and ECL reagents. Skeletal muscle extract, prepared as described above, was precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose/ml at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein A-Sepharose was removed, and the extract was diluted 1:10 in TEE containing 1% TX and 1 mmPMSF. 5 μl of guinea pig anti-PFK-M or guinea pig preimmune serum was added to 1 ml of the diluted extract, and the extract was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein A-Sepharose (50 μl/ml extract) was added, and the extract was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The protein A-antibody complex was pelleted, and the resulting supernatant was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride as described above, and the blot was probed with a monoclonal antibody raised against nNOS. Synaptosomes were prepared as described by Li et al. (29Li X.J. Sharp A.H. Li S.H. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4839-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with modification. Four rat cortices were homogenized in 36 ml of homogenization buffer (320 mm sucrose, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF) using 10 strokes at 900 rpm of a loose fitting glass-Teflon homogenizer (Kontes; size 22). The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant (S1) was collected and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min, and the pellet (P2) was resuspended in 24 ml of homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 13,000 × gfor 15 min. The resulting pellet (P2′), representing a crude synaptosomal fraction, was lysed by osmotic shock and homogenized by three strokes of the glass-Teflon homogenizer at 2000 rpm, and the homogenate was spun at 33,000 × g for 20 min to yield supernatant (LS1) and pellet (LP1, heavy membranes). LS1 was spun at 251,000 × g max for 2 h. The resulting supernatant (LS2) contained soluble proteins, and the pellet (LP2) contained synaptic vesicle proteins. Proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blotting was performed as described above. Adult rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and brains were harvested, postfixed at 4 °C for 3 h, and cryoprotected in 20% sucrose overnight. Brains were sectioned sagitally at 20 μm with a cryostat, and sections were blocked for 1 h in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum and then incubated in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 containing anti-PFK-M (guinea pig, 1:1000) and anti-nNOS (rabbit, 1:500) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized using Cy3-conjugated anti-guinea pig and Cy2-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. Nuclei of all cells in the section were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Sections were mounted on slides (Frost Plus slides; Fisher), and photographs were taken under fluorescence microscopy at 200×. Control experiments lacking anti-PFK-M or anti-nNOS antibodies yielded no staining. To identify proteins that bind to the PDZ domain of nNOS in brain, we covalently coupled a nNOS PDZ domain GST fusion protein to Affi-Gel 10 (nNOS-Affi-Gel) and incubated this column with brain extract (nNOS-extract in Fig. 1). The column was washed with the buffer used to solubilize the brain extract, and proteins tightly bound to the column were eluted off sequentially with 2.5 and 4 m urea in buffer. Eluted proteins were compared with proteins that eluted from two control columns: first, a column of GST coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (GST-Affi-Gel) that was incubated with brain extract (GST-extract) to identify nonspecific binding proteins, and second, a column of the PDZ domain protein coupled to Affi-Gel 10 incubated with buffer (nNOS-buffer) to identify nNOS fusion protein that leached off of the column. As seen in Fig. 1, proteins of 45, 53, 60, and 65 kDa leached from the nNOS-Affi-Gel buffer control column (lanes 1 and 4). Additionally, a number of nonspecific proteins (31, 33, 35, 39, and 50 kDa) eluted from both the nNOS- and GST-Affi-Gel columns (lanes 2, 3,5, and 6). These proteins either bind to GST or nonspecifically bind to Affi-Gel beads. The most abundant protein eluted specifically from the nNOS-column is a protein doublet at approximately 80 kDa (lanes 3 and 6). This doublet does not bind to a control GST column and is not a product of proteolysis of the linked fusion protein. This doublet as present in both the 2.5 and 4 m urea eluates (lanes 3 and6). Fractions containing this doublet were combined, the more abundant upper protein was isolated, and a single peptide was sequenced by Edman degradation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The sequence obtained (Fig.2) showed high homology to the previously sequenced rat muscle phosphofructokinase (PFK-M, Fig. 2).Figure 2Sequence identity of the muscle isoform of rat PFK and the peptide obtained from the 80-kDa nNOS-binding protein. Fractions eluted from the nNOS column were resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis above and were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride paper. The upper band of the 80-kDa doublet was excised and digested with CNBr, and peptides lacking an N-terminal proline were blocked with O-phthalaldehyde. Microsequencing then yielded the single major sequence shown. X represents ambiguous amino acids in the sequenced peptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been previously shown that the PDZ domain of nNOS preferentially binds to peptides ending with the sequence G(D/E)AV (19Stricker N.L. Christopherson K.S. Yi B.A. Schatz P.J. Raab R.W. Dawes G. Bassett J.D.E. Bredt D.S. Li M. Nature Bio/Technology. 1997; 15: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 30Schepens J. Cuppen E. Wieringa B. Hendriks W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or EIAV (20Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the final four amino acids of rat PFK-M are EAAV, a sequence similar to that of CAPON, a brain-specific protein isolated as a nNOS PDZ-binding partner (20Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which ends with EIAV. To determine whether PFK binds to the peptide-binding site in the nNOS PDZ domain, we performed binding experiments with the PDZ domain of nNOS fused to GST. Fig. 3 (top panel) shows that PFK-M from both brain and skeletal muscle binds to the PDZ domain of nNOS. Furthermore, this binding can be competed with the peptide VSPDFGDAV, suggesting that PFK-M binding is at the peptide-binding site in nNOS-PDZ. Neither of the peptides, KLSSIESDV, which binds to the second PDZ domain of PSD-95, and KLSSIEADA, a control peptide that does not bind to any PDZ domain, compete the binding of PFK-M to the PDZ domain of nNOS (Fig. 3, middle panel). Experiments using the final nine amino acids of PFK-M fused to GST show that nNOS can bind to this C-terminal protein sequence (data not shown). In addition, VSPDFGDAV also competes the binding of CAPON to nNOS PDZ (Fig. 3,bottom panel). These results suggest that PFK-M binds to the nNOS-PDZ peptide-binding site, as does CAPON. To determine whether PFK-M and nNOS interact in vivo, we immunoprecipitated PFK-M from skeletal muscle extract. Skeletal muscle was used rather than brain because PFK-M is the only PFK isoform expressed in muscle (31Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, immunoprecipitation of PFK-M depleted nNOS from the extract, whereas incubation of the extract with preimmune serum did not. These data suggest that PFK-M and nNOS interact in vivo and that a large fraction of nNOS in skeletal muscle cytosol is associated with PFK-M. We also evaluated possible association of nNOS and PFK in brain. In order for these two proteins to interact, they must be co-localized. To determine whether nNOS and PFK-M are co-localized in brain, we performed subcellular fractionation (Fig.5). In this preparation (29Li X.J. Sharp A.H. Li S.H. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4839-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), cortical homogenate is centrifuged at low speed yielding a crude nuclear fraction (P1). The supernatant (S1) is centrifuged providing a P2 pellet and S1 supernatant. The P2 pellet is washed to yield P2′, a crude synaptosome fraction also containing mitochondria. After hypotonic lysis of P2′, a plasma membrane fraction (LP1) containing pre- and postsynaptic membranes and the postsynaptic density was obtained. The soluble fraction was spun to obtain synaptic vesicles (LP2) and soluble cellular components (LS2). As seen in Fig. 5, nNOS is found in both soluble and particulate fractions. nNOS is enriched in synaptosomes (P2′) and in the synaptic vesicle fraction (LP2), which is enriched in synaptophysin, a synaptic vesicle marker. Similarly, PFK is found in both soluble and particulate fractions. PFK is present in synaptosomes (P2′); however, unlike nNOS, PFK is found only in the synaptic vesicle fraction (LP2) when P2′ is fractionated. It is important to note that PSD-95, a protein enriched in the postsynaptic density, is concentrated in LP1 (Fig. 5). Because both nNOS and PFK-M are enriched in the LP2 fraction, or synaptic vesicle fraction, synaptic vesicles serve as a cellular site where the two proteins can interact. nNOS is expressed in a discrete subpopulation of interneurons in the corpus striatum and cerebral cortex. To determine whether PFK-M is present in these neurons, we immunostained for both nNOS and PFK-M in adult rat brain sections. As seen in Fig. 6, cortical interneurons that express nNOS are enriched in PFK-M. This was seen in 15 of 15 cortical neurons and 12 of 12 striatal interneurons examined. The primary finding of this study is that PFK-M is associated with nNOS in brain and skeletal muscle. PFK-M binds to the PDZ domain of nNOS, and this binding can be competed with a peptide, VSPDFGDAV, that also specifically binds to the PDZ domain of nNOS. Like the binding of PFK-M, the binding of CAPON (20Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) to the PDZ domain of nNOS can also be competed by the VSPDFGDAV peptide, suggesting that the two proteins bind to the same site in the nNOS PDZ domain. We have also shown that PFK-M and nNOS associate in vivo because immunoprecipitation of PFK-M from cytosolic muscle extract depletes nNOS. Furthermore, many cortical neurons that are enriched in nNOS are also enriched in PFK-M. There are three main isoforms of PFK: PFK-M (alternatively known as PFK-A), PFK-L (alternatively known as PFK-B), and PFK-C. PFK-M the only isoform of PFK found in skeletal muscle and diaphragm (31Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PFK-L is the major isoform of PFK expressed in liver (31Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). PFK-C was originally isolated from brain (32Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4180-4185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is co-expressed with the two other isoforms of PFK in the brain where these three isoforms form heterotetramers (31Dunaway G.A. Kasten T.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 242: 667-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 33Foe L.G. Kemp R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 726-730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Zeitschel U. Bigl M. Eschrich K. Bigl V. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PFK-M is the only isoform that ends in the consensus for nNOS PDZ binding (20Jaffrey S.R. Snowman A.M. Eliasson M.J. Cohen N.A. Snyder S.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 115-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), and hence is likely to be the only isoform that can bind to nNOS directly. We have shown that PFK-M binds to nNOS at a peptide-binding site in the PDZ domain of nNOS (Fig.3) as PFK-M can be competed off with a peptide that binds to this peptide-binding site and that competes with the binding of CAPON. Because PFK-M is the only isoform found in muscle, it serves as a good tissue in which to study the association of PFK-M and nNOS in vivo. Our data demonstrate that PFK-M binds to nNOS from skeletal muscle extracts and that a large fraction of nNOS in muscle cytosol associates with PFK (Figs. 3 and 4). This interaction may be functionally important because NO can regulate energy metabolism in normal muscle. In rodent myofibers, nNOS is specifically enriched at neuromuscular endplates (16Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar) and in fast twitch fibers, which are known to be glycolytic (35Kobzik L. Reid M.B. Bredt D.S. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1994; 372: 546-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Exercise-stimulated glucose transport (36Roberts C.K. Barnard R.J. Scheck S.H. Balon T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E220-E225PubMed Google Scholar) and cytokine-modulated glucose transport (37Bédard S. Marcotte B. Marette A. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) are dependent on NO. It is possible that in glycolytic fast twitch fibers, nNOS regulates both glucose transport and PFK function. We wondered whether the nNOS-PFK-M interaction might directly regulate enzyme activities. However, we found that PFK activity of skeletal muscle from nNOS−/− mice is not different from that of wild type mice, nor does addition of a glutathioneS-transferase protein encoding the PDZ domain of nNOS to skeletal muscle extracts change PFK activity. 2B. L. Firestein and D. S. Bredt, unpublished observations. PFK activity does not affect nNOS activity because adding brain lysate containing PFK activators has no effect on nNOS activity.2 With this in mind, we suspect that PFK-M interactions help determine the disposition of cytosolic nNOS rather than directly regulate enzyme activity. In brain, nNOS is targeted to the plasma membrane and postsynaptic density by PSD-95 and PSD-93 proteins via PDZ-PDZ interactions (15Brenman J.E. Christopherson K.S. Craven S.E. McGee A.W. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7407-7415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), whereas PFK-M is a cytosolic protein and may target nNOS to the cytosol. In fact, a significant fraction nNOS in brain is soluble (38Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). In addition, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1 is targeted to PFK-M via a protein-protein interaction (39Zhao S. Lee E.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8318-8324Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and thus, the binding of PFK-M to the PDZ domain of nNOS may target nNOS to a cytosolic complex of enzymes. By subcellular fractionation of brain homogenates, we find that both nNOS and PFK-M are enriched in synaptosomes and, more specifically, in a synaptic vesicle fraction (Fig. 5). These data are consistent with electron microscopic data that nNOS is present at nerve terminals in the cerebral cortex (40Aoki C. Rhee J. Lubin M. Dawson T.M. Brain Res. 1997; 750: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the nucleus accumbens (41Gracy K.N. Pickel V.M. Brain Res. 1997; 747: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of the rat where NO can serve to modulate synaptic vesicle docking (42Meffert M.K. Premack B.A. Schulman H. Neuron. 1994; 12: 1235-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 43Meffert M.K. Calakos N.C. Scheller R.H. Schulman H. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1229-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Similarly, phosphofructokinase activity is detected in synaptosomes (44Erecinska M. Deas J. Silver I.A. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2765-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and phosphofructokinase enzyme protein occurs in presynaptic terminals (45Garner J.A. Linse K.D. Polk R.K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 845-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) where glycolysis generates ATP after synaptic transmission (46Parducz A. Loctin F. Babel-Guérin E. Dunant Y. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, the binding of PFK-M to the PDZ domain of nNOS might serve to localize these proteins to presynaptic terminals where they are involved in different phases of synaptic transmission. A striking result of our work is that PFK-M is enriched in many nNOS-expressing neurons in the cerebral cortex (Fig. 6). This is an important concept because neurons that express nNOS are resistant to NO-mediated neurotoxicity. However, actual mechanisms responsible for this neuroprotection are uncertain. Very recently, Dawson and colleagues (47Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Ensz L.M. Mukhina G. Lebovitz R.M. Zwacka R.M. Engelhardt J.F. Oberley L.W. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. J.

The group found that MnSOD is enriched in cortical neurons that express nNOS and that antisense to MnSOD renders nNOS-expressing neurons susceptible to NMDA receptor-induced neurotoxicity. Overexpression of MnSOD results in protection of cortical neurons from NMDA- or NO-induced neurotoxicity, and cortical neurons expressing nNOS protein cultured from MnSOD knockout mice are sensitive to NMDA exposure. It is possible that MnSOD is not the only protective protein that confers resistance to glutamate-induced neurotoxicity because MnSOD is not exclusively enriched in nNOS containing neurons. We believe that we have provided an additional mechanism for neuroprotection of nNOS containing neurons: the binding of PFK-M to nNOS and its enrichment in nNOS protein-expressing neurons. There are a number of reports that fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), the glycolytic intermediate produced via the reaction catalyzed by PFK, is neuroprotective. FBP administered systemically after hypoxia-ischemia reduces central nervous system injury in neonatal rats (24Sola A. Berrios M. Sheldon R.A. Ferriero D.M. Gregory G.A. Brain Res. 1996; 741: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which FBP acts is unknown, but Sola and colleagues suggest three alternative models (24Sola A. Berrios M. Sheldon R.A. Ferriero D.M. Gregory G.A. Brain Res. 1996; 741: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). First, FBP may enhance anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism (48Kirtley M.E. McKay M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1977; 18: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). FBP can also increase intracellular pH (49Rigobello M.P. Galzigna L. Farm. Ed. Sci. 1982; 37: 459-462PubMed Google Scholar, 50Bernasconi C. Piolini M. Bozzini F. Ferraresi I. Agostoni A. Res. Commun. Chem. Pathol. Pharmacol. 1983; 42: 281-292PubMed Google Scholar) and reduce intracellular calcium by binding it (51Hassinen I.E. Nuutinen E.M. Ito K. Nioka S. Lazzarino G. Giardina B. Chance B. Circulation. 1991; 83: 584-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Similarly, FBP preserves ATP levels during hypoxia in neonatal brain slices (25Espanol M.T. Litt L. Hasegawa K. Chang L.H. Macdonald J.M. Gregory G. James T.L. Chan P.H. Anesthesiology. 1998; 88: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In aging rats, ischemic-induced memory dysfunction can be reversed by dimethyl sulfoxide-FBP, which serves to scavenge free radicals (26de la Torre J.C. Nelson N. Sutherland R.J. Pappas B.A. Brain Res. 1998; 779: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, nNOS-expressing neurons may express high levels of FBP because they are enriched in PFK-M. Furthermore, FBP activates PFK via a feed-forward mechanism, resulting in amplification of FBP production. Thus, nNOS positive neurons may be protected from NO-induced neurotoxicity via a FBP-dependent mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2068424176,"Certain Chlamydomonas reinhardtiimutants deficient in photosystem I due to defects in psaAmRNA maturation have been reported to be capable of CO2fixation, H2 photoevolution, and photoautotrophic growth (Greenbaum, E., Lee, J.

We have generated deletions of photosystem I core subunits in both wild type and these mutant strains and have analyzed their abilities to grow photoautotrophically, to fix CO2, and to photoevolve O2 or H2 (using mass spectrometry) as well as their photosystem I content (using immunological and spectroscopic analyses). We find no instance of a strain that can perform photosynthesis in the absence of photosystem I. The F8 strain harbored a small amount of photosystem I, and it could fix CO2 and grow slowly, but it lost these abilities after deletion of eitherpsaA or psaC; these activities could be restored to the F8-psaAΔ mutant by reintroduction ofpsaA. We observed limited O2photoevolution in mutants lacking photosystem I; use of18O2 indicated that this O2evolution is coupled to O2 uptake (i.e.respiration) rather than CO2 fixation or H2evolution. We conclude that the reported instances of CO2fixation, H2 photoevolution, and photoautotrophic growth of photosystem I-deficient mutants result from the presence of unrecognized photosystem I.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1958; 9: 1-24Crossref Google Scholar, 4Myers J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1971; 22: 289-312Crossref Google Scholar). The discovery of cytochromesb and f led to the concept that they served as intermediaries between the two photosystems, which operated in series to achieve linear electron transfer from H2O to NADP+ (5Hill R. Bendall F. Nature. 1960; 186: 136-137Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The essence of this “Z-scheme” model is that photosystem II (PS II)1accomplishes the oxidation of water and the reduction of plastoquinone and cytochromes but is unable to reduce ferredoxin or NADP+; photosystem I (PS I) is required for the reduction of NADP+ and the oxidation of cytochrome fthrough the mediation of the soluble protein plastocyanin. Although other explanations have been proffered for the enhancement effect and photosystem cooperativity (6Arnon D.I. Photosynth. Res. 1995; 46: 47-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the Z-scheme is strongly supported by experimental data (7Duysens L.N.M. Amesz J. Kamp B.M. Nature. 1961; 190: 510-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and is currently considered as the “central dogma” of oxygenic photosynthesis (8Trebst A. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1974; 25: 423-458Crossref Google Scholar, 9Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1995: 653-682Google Scholar). However, photosynthetic CO2 fixation and photoautotrophic growth were recently reported (1Greenbaum E. Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Blankinship S.L. Mets L.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 438-441Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Owens T.G. Greenbaum E. Science. 1996; 273: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) in two PS I-deficient mutants, B4 and F8, both of which are nuclear mutants deficient in thetrans-splicing of the psaA mRNA (1Greenbaum E. Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Blankinship S.L. Mets L.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 438-441Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 10Girard J. Chua N.H. Bennoun P. Schmidt G. Delosme M. Curr.

Genet. 1990; 223: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Using a gas flow apparatus, Greenbaum et al. (1Greenbaum E. Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Blankinship S.L. Mets L.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 438-441Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were able to measure an evolution of O2 coupled to CO2fixation or to H2 evolution. The amount of CO2fixed by these mutant strains was roughly equivalent to that measured in wild-type (WT) cells. Although CO2 fixation in the PS I-deficient strains initially appeared to be limited to anaerobic conditions (1Greenbaum E. Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Blankinship S.L. Mets L.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 438-441Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar), photoautotrophic growth was later reported in the presence of O2 (2Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Owens T.G. Greenbaum E. Science. 1996; 273: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Several control experiments were carried out by the authors to eliminate the possibility of trace amounts of PS I. Irradiation with far red light (λ > 700 nm), which excites PS I but not PS II, produced a small amount of H2evolution in WT cells but not in the B4 mutant (1Greenbaum E. Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Blankinship S.L. Mets L.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 438-441Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Photobleaching experiments also failed to detect P700 in thylakoid membranes from these mutants (2Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Owens T.G. Greenbaum E. Science. 1996; 273: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The core of PS I is made up of the two largest subunits, PsaA and PsaB. They bind all of the cofactors involved in intra-PS I electron transport with the exception of the terminal iron-sulfur clusters, which are bound by the extrinsic PsaC subunit. Methods to delete the chloroplast genes psaA, psaB, andpsaC, have been described recently (12Fischer N. Stampacchia O. Redding K. Rochaix J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Such mutants were incapable of CO2 fixation or photoautotrophic growth, but reintroduction of the deleted gene restored photoautotrophic growth (13Cournac L. Redding K. Bennoun P. Peltier G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 65-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14Fischer N. Setif P. Rochaix J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 15Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses can be formulated to explain the discrepancy between the results with deletion mutants and trans-splicing mutants. On the one hand, the B4 and F8 strains could have harbored undetected amounts of PS I that allowed synthesis of enough NADPH to fix CO2 and grow photoautotrophically. On the other hand, the B4 and F8 strains could have possessed an as yet unidentified system that allowed PS I-independent reduction of NADP+. We have undertaken an analysis of several different PS I-deficient mutants (see Fig. 1) to examine critically the claim that PS I-deficient mutants can perform photosynthesis. We have used immunoblots to detect PS I subunits as well as spectroscopic means to measure photooxidizable P700, the primary electron donor of PS I (for reviews on PS I, see Refs. 16Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Lee C.P. Current Topics in Bioenergetics: Light Driven Reactions in Bioenergetics. 16. Academic Press, Inc., New York1991: 83-177Google Scholar and 17Brettel K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We have made use of real time mass spectroscopy to measure the rates of O2 photoevolution, CO2 fixation, and H2 photoevolution. Our results indicate very clearly that photosynthesis requires the presence of active PS I. Our WT strain was isolated as an mt+ segregant from a cross between two derivatives of the 137c strain (18Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar). The original deletions of psaA andpsaC were made in this strain (12Fischer N. Stampacchia O. Redding K. Rochaix J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Isolates of the F8 strain (10Girard J. Chua N.H. Bennoun P. Schmidt G. Delosme M. Curr. Genet. 1980; 2: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. E. Greenbaum (Oak Ridge National Laboratory) and from the Chlamydomonas Stock Center (Duke University). The FUD26 strain (19Girard-Bascou J. Choquet Y. Schneider M. Delosme M. Dron M. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 20Girard-Bascou J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 12: 483-488Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. J. Girard Bascou (Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique) and Dr. L. Mets (University of Chicago). The B4 strain (1Greenbaum E. Lee J.W. Tevault C.V. Blankinship S.L. Mets L.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 438-441Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. L. Mets. Bioballistic chloroplast transformations were performed with plasmids designed to delete the psaA and psaC genes, and homoplasmicity of these deletions was assessed by polymerase chain reactions (12Fischer N. Stampacchia O. Redding K. Rochaix J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The aadA cassettes used to deletepsaA or psaC were flanked by direct repeats; homologous recombination between them removes the aadA cassette, leaving one repeat behind (12Fischer N. Stampacchia O. Redding K. Rochaix J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). After several subcloning steps on medium without antibiotic, spectinomycin-sensitive isolates were obtained; loss of aadA was confirmed by specific polymerase chain reactions (12Fischer N. Stampacchia O. Redding K. Rochaix J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All experiments herein used theaadA-less strains to eliminate any differences due to chloroplastic expression of the aminoglycoside adenyltransferase enzyme. The third exon of psaA was reintroduced by bombarding psaAΔ mutants with plasmid pKR137 (15Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which carries psaA exon 3 with the psbD-aadA-rbcLcassette (21Nickelsen J. van Dillewijn J. Rahire M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3182-3191Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) inserted at the EcoRI site approximately 300 base pairs downstream of psaA exon 3. During characterization of one of the psaAΔ deletion mutants of B4 (B4-psaAΔ-2), we isolated a photoautotrophic revertant able to grow on minimal medium. This clone, renamed B4-r2, was subsequently found to express PsaA and was not homoplasmic forpsaAΔ. Further subcloning of B4-psaAΔ-2 on antibiotic medium produced clones homoplasmic for psaAΔ. We attempted to isolate photoautotrophic revertants of B4-psaAΔ-2 in three separate trials by spreading cells on high salt minimal agar medium (HSM; 9 × 105 cells cm−2) and illuminating them (30–60 μmol of photons m−2 s−1) either aerobically or anaerobically. For some of these experiments, we UV-irradiated the HSM plates (8 mJ cm−2 of 260-nm radiation) immediately after plating the cells and held them in the dark for 24–48 h before illumination in an attempt to increase the reversion frequency. In total, 3.7 × 109 cells were tested (1.7 × 109 cells without UV and 2.0 × 109 cells with UV treatment), and no photoautotrophic revertants were isolated. However, B4 appears to revert at a low rate, and we have succeeded in isolating only two photoautotrophic revertants from it. Tris acetate/phosphate medium (TAP) and HSM for heterotrophic and photoautotrophic growth, respectively, were prepared as described (18Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar). Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cultures were maintained at 25 °C. In general, 100-ml TAP cultures were shaken at 180 rpm in 500-ml Erlenmeyer flasks under low illumination (∼1 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). For growth tests, 12 μl of log phase cultures were spotted onto agar media. TAP plates were kept under low light (<1 μmol of photons m−2s−1). HSM plates were subjected to anaerobiosis using the Biomérieux Generbag Anaer system (Marcy L'Etoile, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were strongly illuminated (300 μmol of photons m−2 s−1). Fluorescence induction kinetics were measured using a laboratory-built video fluorometer (22Fenton J.M. Crofts A.R. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 26: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar, 23Farah J. Rappaport F. Choquet Y. Joliot P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4976-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) on cultures grown upon TAP plates under low light. Immunoblot analysis of total cellular membranes using the anti-PsaA and anti-PsaD antibodies was performed as described previously (15Redding K. MacMillan F. Leibl W. Brettel K. Hanley J. Rutherford A.W. Breton J. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Cultures were harvested by centrifugation (8 min at 4000 rpm in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 4 °C) and washed with cold 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3). Aliquots corresponding to 7.5 × 107 cells and at least 100 μg of chlorophyll were centrifuged, resuspended in 500 μl of 200 μg/ml Ficoll 400 in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), frozen on dry ice, and shipped from Geneva to University Park. Control experiments demonstrated that repeated freezing and thawing of Chlamydomonas cells in the presence of Ficoll does not affect the photochemical activity of P700 measured within 1 h after thawing. The spectroscopic method is based upon techniques developed by Harbinson and Woodward (24Harbinson J. Woodward F.I. Plant Cell Environ. 1987; 10: 131-140Google Scholar). The thawed sample suspensions, with the addition of 10 mm sodium ascorbate and 4 μm2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol, were placed in a 10 × 4-mm quartz cuvette. The longer dimension of the cuvette was traversed by the 832-nm probe beam from a 06GIC108 laser diode (Melles Griot, Boulder, CO; 22-kHz sine-wave modulation; 20 milliwatts average power). The beam was directed to a silicon photodiode detector shielded by a red cut-off filter (λ > 760 nm) and was measured at the time constant of 3 ms. The actinic light from a 300-watt tungsten lamp was filtered using a hot mirror and a red cut-off filter to provide a broad band peaking at 715 nm with a full-width half-maximum of 40 nm and an intensity of 60 μmol of photons m−2 s−1, incident on the sample at a right angle to the probe beam. The actinic light was controlled with a shutter (Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY; 2-ms full opening/closing time). The absorbance changes (ΔA) were analyzed using IgorPro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR), and their amplitudes were calculated as 0.434*ΔI/I, where I is the intensity of probe beam, and ΔI is the actinic light-induced change. Due to variations in sample densities (in the range of 1.6–7 × 107 cells ml−1), the ΔA signals were normalized to cell density. Algal cultures were harvested, and 1.5 ml of the suspension was placed in the measuring chamber. Dissolved gases were directly introduced in the ion source of the mass spectrometer (model MM 14–80, VG instruments, Cheshire, United Kingdom) through a Teflon membrane. For O2exchange measurements, the sample was sparged with N2 to remove 16O2, and 18O2(95% 18O isotope content; Euriso-Top; Saint Aubin, France) was then introduced to reach an O2 concentration close to the equilibrium with air. CO2 exchange measurements were performed following the NaH13CO3 addition (0.3 mm final concentration; 99% 13C isotope content; Euriso-Top) in the dark before recording CO2exchange. Light was supplied by a fiber optic illuminator (Schott, Main, Germany), and neutral filters were used to vary light intensity. Unless specified, experiments shown here were performed at 300 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 incident light. All gas exchange measurements were performed at 25 °C. The hydrogenase enzyme is known to be inactivated by oxygen and to require anaerobic conditions for its induction. Thus, for measurements of H2 evolution, cultures were first subjected to anaerobiosis by sparging the sample with N2, closing the chamber, and letting the algae consume O2 from the medium. The O2 concentration was monitored by mass spectrometry until it became undetectable (<0.2 μm), and the cultures were incubated for a further 30 min. In companion experiments, glucose (20 mm final concentration) and glucose oxidase (2 mg/ml final concentration) were added to verify that O2 depletion before illumination was complete and that hydrogenase induction and activity were not affected by residual oxygen. To introduce the methods used in this work, we will first describe characterization of the WT strain (see “Experimental Procedures”), which can grow photoautotrophically as well as heterotrophically on acetate-containing medium in the dark (Fig.2 A). Using specific antibodies against either PsaA (an integral membrane core subunit) or PsaD (a stromal subunit involved in docking ferredoxin to the acceptor side of PS I; Refs. 25Hanley J. Setif P. Bottin H. Lagoutte B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8563-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar and 26Lelong C. Setif P. Lagoutte B. Bottin H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10034-10039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we could easily visualize these polypeptides in membranes prepared from the WT strain (Fig. 2 A). The in vivo fluorescence induction kinetics (Fig. 2 B) are typical of normal algae (27Bennoun P. Chua N.H. Bücher T. Neupert W. Sebald W. Werner S. Genetics and Biogenesis of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1976: 33-39Google Scholar). The rise in fluorescence, which is correlated with reduced QA in PS II, is due to the reduction of the plastoquinone pool, while the subsequent drop has been interpreted as originating from oxidation of the plastoquinone pool due to the combined action of PS I and cytochrome b 6 f (28Krause G. Weis E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 313-349Crossref Scopus (3695) Google Scholar). In order to measure PS I quantitatively, we monitored the kinetics and extent of photooxidation and dark reduction of P700 by following the increase of its absorbance at 832 nm (see “Experimental Procedures”). Photooxidation of P700 results in a broad absorbance in the near-IR due to the loss of the ground state character in oxidized chlorophyll and is monitored as an increase in absorbance at 832 nm. Optimization experiments indicated that the maximum amount of P700+ could be observed within 1 s of illumination with far-red light in the presence of sodium ascorbate and 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The near-IR measuring beam is not able to photooxidize P700 by itself, thus eliminating a possibility of underestimating the amount of photochemically active P700. The maximum level of P700 oxidation is attained using far-red excitation, since this preferentially excites PS I, thereby decreasing the rate of P700+reduction in the light. In WT cells, P700 is oxidized within 200 ms of illumination and is completely rereduced within 2 s after termination of excitation (Fig. 3). We used continuous mass spectrometry to determine the in vivo rates of O2 evolution, CO2 fixation, and H2 photoevolution. We were able to distinguish photosynthetic from respiratory activities by the inclusion of [18O]O2 and [13C]CO2 (25Hanley J. Setif P. Bottin H. Lagoutte B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8563-8571Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The disappearance of [13C]CO2 starting within 10 s after the commencement of illumination is indicative of the activation of the Calvin cycle enzymes, which then cooperate to convert gaseous CO2 to carbohydrate (30Hoober J.K. Siekevitz P. Chloroplasts: Cellular Organelles. Plenum Press, New York1984Crossref Google Scholar). The WT cells removed CO2 from the medium in a light-dependent manner at a steady-state rate of 1.5 μmol min−1 mg of chlorophyll−1 when illuminated with 300 μmol of photons m−2 s−1 (Fig. 4; TableI). When the photon flux was reduced 100-fold, CO2 uptake occurred at 1.2% of this rate (Fig.4). The O2 evolution rate was equivalent to this value (Table I), as expected; for each molecule of O2 produced, one molecule of CO2 is fixed. The respiration rate, as measured by uptake of 18O2, was not greatly affected by the light (Table I). Under anaerobic conditions, the chloroplast enzyme hydrogenase is induced and can serve as an alternate acceptor of electrons from ferredoxin (31Gaffron H. Rubin J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1942; 26: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 32Stuart T.S. Gaffron H. Planta. 1972; 106: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Stuart T.S. Gaffron H. Planta. 1972; 106: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). After removal of O2, production of H2 in WT cells was observed immediately upon illumination (Fig. 5).Table ISummary of characteristics of the strains under studyStrain genotypeAmount of PSIaLevels of PsaA and PsaD polypeptides in total cellular membranes were determined by densitometry of the immunoblot shown in Fig. 1, which is representative of results seen in other such experiments (data not shown). Levels of photooxidizable P700were determined by comparing the signals of the various mutants with WT as shown in Fig. 2. Note that the disagreement between the detection of PS I by immunological or spectroscopic means may be due to the different ways used to normalize the signals (i.e. to equal amounts of protein or to equal numbers of cells).Phototrophic growthbThe photoautotrophic rates are expressed qualitatively (+++, normal growth; ++, suboptimal growth; +, poor growth; −, no growth).CO2 uptake rate (light)cThese values are expressed as nmol min−1 (mg of chlorophyll)−1.

Stampacchia O. Redding K. Rochaix J.D. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). These deletions remove the entire coding sequence of psaA exon 3 (which encodes the last 661 amino acid residues of the 751-residue PsaA polypeptide), 96% of the psaB gene, or all of thepsaC gene. Thus, such deletion mutants should be incapable of reversion. We found that the psaA and psaC deletion mutants could not grow photoautotrophically and gave fluorescence induction patterns typical of mutants lacking PS I (Fig.2; results were identical forpsaBΔ, data not shown), in that the fluorescence rose to a high level and remained constant (34Takahashi Y.

The cytoplasmic membrane protein, MexB, appears to function as the xenobiotic-exporting subunit, whereas the MexA and OprM proteins are supposed to function as the membrane fusion protein and the outer membrane channel protein, respectively. Computer-aided hydropathy analyses of MexB predicted the presence of up to 17 potential transmembrane segments.

Among those opportunistic pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosais particularly problematic, since the bacteria show resistance to many structurally and functionally diverse antibiotics (1Brown M.R.W. Brown M.R.W. Resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. John Wiley and Sons, London1975: 71-107Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that this type of resistance is attributable to a synergy of low outer membrane permeability and active drug extrusion (2Nakae T. Yoshihara E. Yoneyama H. J. Infect. Chemother. 1997; 3: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). An increasing number of multidrug extrusion systems are being reported in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (2Nakae T. Yoshihara E. Yoneyama H. J. Infect. Chemother. 1997; 3: 173-183Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 3Rella M. Haas D. Antimicrob.

Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that active extrusion systems play a crucial role in the cellular defense mechanism against incoming noxious compounds in many living organisms. It is of great interest and importance, therefore, to analyze the mechanism by which such universally occurring extrusion pump function. The wild-type P. aeruginosa expresses a low level of the MexA,B-OprM drug extrusion machinery (9Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 10Moreshed S.R.M. Lei Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Mutations innalB gene cause overexpression of the mexA,B-oprMoperon rendering the bacterium more resistant than the wild-type strain to a broad spectrum of antibiotics (3Rella M. Haas D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 22: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Deletion of the coding region of the wild-type mexA, mexB, or oprMrenders the mutant more susceptible than the wild-type strain to many antibiotics (9Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 11Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Tsuda M. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, it is apparent that the MexA,B-OprM machinery is involved in the both basal and elevated levels of intrinsic antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa. The MexA,B-OprM pump consists of three subunits, MexA, MexB, and OprM, located at the inner and outer membrane, respectively (9Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 10Moreshed S.R.M. Lei Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). MexB consists of 1046 amino acid residues and is assumed to extrude the xenobiotics utilizing the proton motive force as the energy source (4Lei Y. Sato K. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar,12Ocaktan A. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21964-21969Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This protein belongs to the resistant/nodulation/division (RND)1 family (13Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dong Q. Mergeay M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 185-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). MexA is an inner membrane-associated lipoprotein belonging to the membrane fusion protein family. OprM is an outer membrane protein probably forming the xenobiotics exit channel. A complex formation by these three subunit proteins has been suggested for many efflux pump assemblies in Gram-negative bacteria (13Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Dinh T. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3825-3831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Nikaido H.

Trends Microbiol. 1994; 2: 489-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In fact, the functional coupling of the RND protein and the membrane fusion protein was recently demonstrated by the subunit exchange experiments using three efflux pump systems in P. aeruginosa (18Srikumar R. Li X. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7875-7881Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 19Gotoh N. Tsujimoto H. Nomura A. Okamoto K. Tsuda M. Nishino T. FEMS Microbiol.

Microbiol. 1997; 23: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), while the outer membrane components could be substituted with other proteins having a similar function. However, the precise molecular mechanism of substrate recognition and efflux through these pumps remained to be clarified. For a better understanding of how this pump extrudes the xenobiotics, it is essential to elucidate the structure and membrane topology of the individual pump subunit. The membrane topology of several RND family proteins was suggested to have 12 transmembrane domains and two large hydrophilic domains (13Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,22Saier Jr., M.H. Tam R. Reizer A. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of MexB by the TOP-PRED II 1.1 software packages (23von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar) suggested that it might have 12 certain and 5 putative transmembrane segments (TMS). Some other software predicted the presence of 11 TMS. The topology of cytoplasmic membrane proteins in Gram-negative bacteria was often studied by the phoA gene fusion method. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) is enzymatically active after translocation to the periplasm, but is inactive when localized cytoplasmically (24Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 25Manoil C. Mekalanos J.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 515-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several tools, including TnphoA, TnTAP, pPHO7, and pBADphoA (24Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar, 26Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Gutierrez C. Devedjian J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 3999Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), have been developed to construct thephoA fusion to the target protein. Although transposon-mediated generation of gene fusion is simple, insertion of the reporter gene at a specific target site can be tedious. This difficulty is even more pronounced if a target protein has short extramembranous loops. An alternative method is cloning of PCR products to the 5′-end of the signal sequenceless phoA gene (28Boyd D. Traxler B. Beckwich J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 553-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using these two methods, we analyzed the topology of MexB. This paper reports the two-dimensional transmembrane structure of MexB. The Escherichia colistrains used were LMG194 [F− Δara714 leu::Tn10 ΔlacX74 ΔphoA(PvuII) galE galK thi rpsL] (29Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Bechwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar) and CC118 (araD139 Δ(ara, leu)7697 ΔlacX74 ΔphoA20 galE galK thi rpsE rpoB argE am recA1) (24Manoil C. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8129-8133Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The plasmid pBADphoA is a cloning vector containing a signal sequenceless phoA with a KpnI cloning site just in front of phoA. The construction of pBADphoAfrom pSWFII (30Ehrmann M. Boyd D. Beckwich J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7574-7578Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and pBAD22 (29Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Bechwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar) will be described elsewhere. The transposon delivery plasmid pMM1 carries a mini-transposon TnTAP and Tn5 transposase (26Ehrmann M. Bolek P. Mondigler M. Boyd D. Lange R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13111-13115Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). TnTAP contains a stretch of sequence coding for 24 amino acid residues, LTLIHKF ENLYFQSAAAMDPRVPC, including a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site (underlined), signal sequencelessphoA, and neo. The Tn5 transposase is expressedin trans. The plasmid pMEXB1 was constructed by cloning a 3.9-kilobase SalI fragment containing the wild-type mexB to the shuttle vector pMMB67EH (20Yoneyama H. Ocaktan A. Gotoh N. Nishino T. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fusions of the truncated mexB to phoA, encoding for signal sequenceless AP, were carried out by inserting the PCR fragments ofmexB into the 5′-end of the signal sequencelessphoA in pBADphoA. Eleven out of 15 fusions were constructed by cloning the PCR fragments containing flankingKpnI restriction sites into pBADphoA cleaved withKpnI. The PCR primer used for the 5′-end of themexB gene was cccggtaccgTCGAAGTTTTTCATTGATAGG. The 3′-end primers designed for the immediately downstream of the codons Gln34, Glu346, Leu366, Thr392, Gly440, Thr473, Arg538, Gln871, Pro897, Ser921, and Cys972 were aggatggtacCTGGTTGACCGGCAGACTGAG (Gln34), cgcgcggtacCTCGCCGAGGGTCTTCACTAC (Glu346), gccgcggtacCAGCGTGGCGCGGAAG (Leu366), cgcggtacCGTGTTGATCGAGAAGCC (Thr392), ggcgcggtacCCCCTGGATCTGGCCCATGGA (Gly440), cgcgcggtacCGTGATGGAGAACTGCCGGTAGAT (Thr473), cgcggtacCCGATGCTTGAGGATCGAC (Arg538), ccggcggtacCTGCGAGCCGGACAAGC (Gln871), cgcggtacCGGAATCGACCAGCTTTCGTACAG (Pro897), cccccggtacCGACAGGCCGCGCATGGACGTCG (Ser921), and ccatcggtacCGGCCGCAGACGCAT (Pro972), respectively. For the fusion of phoA to codons Gly1007 and Gln1046, we designed the primers allowing in-frame blunt-end ligation, because there are two KpnI sites in this part of mexB. The PCR fragments purified from agarose gel and blunted with the T4 DNA polymerase were ligated to the pBADphoA cleaved by KpnI and blunted with T4 DNA polymerase. The primer used for the 5′-end of the mexB gene was TCGAAGTTTTTCATTGATAGGCCC. Two 3′-end primers used to generatephoA fusions downstream of the codons Gly1007and Gln1046 were cGCCGATCACGCCGGTACCGAT (Gly1007) and aTTGCCCCTTTTCGACGGACGCCTGC (Gln1046), respectively. For fusion pBAD-P9, two oligonucleotides containing the KpnI sites at the both ends were annealed and ligated directly to the pBADphoA cleaved with KpnI. The oligonucleotides for coding and noncoding strands were CGTCGAAGTTTTTCATTGATAGGCCGGTAC and CGGCCTATCAATGAAAAACTTCGACGGTAC, respectively. The host cells used for analysis of AP activity was E. coli LMG194. For most fusion plasmids, codons for valine and proline residues were introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the mexB fragments to introduce theKpnI sites. To obtain in-frame fusions of TnTAP to mexB, the pMM1 containing TnTAP was transformed into the strain E. coli CC118 carrying pMEXB1, which encodes the wild-type mexB. After transposition during overnight growth, a pool of plasmid DNA was isolated and digested with NheI to destroy pMM1, but not pMEXB1 and TnTAP. The restriction digests were transformed again into strain CC118. Blue colonies on agar plates containing 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 200 μg/ml ampicillin (for pMEXB1), and 100 μg/ml kanamycin were purified. Insertions intomexB were identified by PCR. The nucleotide sequence was determined using the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Core Kit with ampliTaq® DNA polymerase, FS. The sequencing primer used was GCAGTAATATCGCCCTGAGCAGC, reading out of the phoA gene toward the mexB gene. In addition, a primer GCGTCACACTTTGCTATGCC reading out of the pBADphoA vector toward themexB gene was also used. AP activity was assayed by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate in permeabilized cells as described elsewhere (31Michaelis S. Inouye H. Oliver D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 366-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of AP activity corresponds to the rate of p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis, 1 μmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate/min/mg of protein at 23 °C. For the Western blot analysis of the hybrid proteins, the crude envelope fraction and whole cell lysate were prepared as described elsewhere (10Moreshed S.R.M. Lei Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%) and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody raised against AP was used to probe the hybrid proteins. Boiling the MexB protein in SDS caused disappearance of the protein band from the gel. To analyze the membrane topology of the MexB protein, we took the 12-TMS model for our working hypothesis and designed the experiments accordingly (Fig.1). We constructed 25 clones expressing COOH-terminal-truncated MexB-AP hybrids and one clone (pBAD-Q1046) expressing phoA at the COOH-terminal end of full-length MexB using pBADphoA and TnTAP (TableI). Cells harboring the pBAD-P9, pBAD-L366, pBAD-V411, pBAD-G440, pBAD-R538, pBAD-P897, pBAD-P972, and pBAD-Q1046 plasmids yielded pale blue colonies, suggesting that the AP domain is located in the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane. The fusion pBAD-V411 was obtained accidentally in the course of pBAD-Q1046 construction. The remaining mexB-phoA fusions exhibited blue colonies on the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate plates suggesting that the AP domain is translocated to the periplasm. The fusion joints were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing and all reading frames were correct (Tables II andIII). The distribution of a total of 26 fusion sites covered the entire MexB protein, and each hydrophobic segment was flanked by phoA fusions (Fig. 1).Table IStrain, plasmid, and the method for construction of the fusionStrainFusion plasmidaAP was fused to the numbered amino acid residues.Method of constructionTNE040pBADphoATNE041pBAD-P9OligbOligonucleotide annealing method.TNE042pBAD-Q34PCRTNE043pBAD-E346PCRTNE044pBAD-L366PCRTNE045pBAD-T392PCRTNE046pBAD-V411PCRTNE047pBAD-G440PCRTNE048pBAD-T473PCRTNE049pBAD-R538PCRTNE050pBAD-Q871PCRTNE051pBAD-P897PCRTNE052pBAD-S921PCRTNE053pBAD-P972PCRTNE054pBAD-G1007PCRTNE055pBAD-Q1046PCRTNE056pMEXB1TNE057pMEXB-D59TAPTnTAPTNE058pMEXB-T89TAPTnTAPTNE059pMEXB-V105TAPTnTAPTNE060pMEXB-R124TAPTnTAPTNE061pMEXB-I214TAPTnTAPTNE062pMEXB-G271TAPTnTAPTNE063pMEXB-T309TAPTnTAPTNE064pMEXB-L349TAPTnTAPTNE065pMEXB-F459TAPTnTAPTNE066pMEXB-N616TAPTnTAPTNE067pMEXB-L696TAPTnTAPa AP was fused to the numbered amino acid residues.b Oligonucleotide annealing method.

We quantified the AP activities of the cells harboring the mexB-phoA fusions (Fig. 1). The AP activities in these cells harboring the fusions derived from pBADphoA were divided into two major classes. One class of cells showed about 0.2–0.4 unit of AP activity, which is close to the activity in the control cell (pBADphoA, 0.32 unit) and another showed 1.7–11 units. Fusions at Pro9, Leu366, Val411, Gly440, Arg538, Pro897, Pro972, and Gln1046belonged to the former class. Therefore, these fusion sites are most likely to be located at the cytoplasmic side (Fig. 1). The remaining fusions, including the Gln34, Glu346, Thr392, Thr473, Gln871, Ser921, and Gly1007 sites, showed high AP activities, suggesting that these sites are located at the periplasmic side (Fig. 1). All the cells harboring the mexB-phoA fusions derived from TnTAP showed an AP activity of about 1–3 units (Fig. 1), whereas the AP activity of cells containing mexB without phoA(pMEXB1) was only 0.33 unit. Based on these results, we concluded that all the fusion sites, including Asp59, Thr89, Val105, Arg124, Ile214, Gly271, Thr309, Leu349, Phe459, Asn616, and Leu696, were located at the periplasmic side (Fig. 1). The expression of hybrid proteins derived from TnTAP and pBADphoA is under the control of lac and araBAD promotor, respectively, and therefore the cells harboring the fusions were induced in the presence of 100 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and 100 μml-arabinose, respectively. The hybrid proteins with high and low AP activities are shown in Fig.2, lanes 3–20 and lanes 21–27, respectively. The size of the hybrid proteins was within the range of the expected molecular mass. The protein band of the fusion at Pro9 was undetectable, since the hybrid protein is expected to be soluble in the cytoplasm. All the bands for cytoplasmic hybrid proteins showed weaker signals than the periplasmic hybrid proteins, which probably was attributable to the proteolytic degradation of the hybrid protein as reported earlier (33Gott P. Boos W. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 655-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34Allard J.D. Bertrand K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17809-17819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, protein bands with a higher molecular mass than expected were seen as reported elsewhere (35Enomoto H. Unemoto T. Nishibuchi M. Padan E. Nakamura T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1370: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This might be explained by suggesting that the chimeric proteins maintaining the native conformation bind less SDS than fully denatured proteins in the electrophoresis buffer, because the samples were subjected to electrophoresis without heating. Fusion Gly440 appeared only in a higher molecular weight range than expected and was barely seen. Most living organisms, if not all, seem to be equipped with xenobiotics extrusion pump(s). Mammalian cells, for instance, express P-glycoproteins (8Goldstein L.J. Galski H. Fojo A. Willingham M. Lai S.L. Gazdar A. Priker R. Green A. Crist W. Brodeur G.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1989; 81: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar), multidrug resistance associated protein (36Cole S.P. Bhardwaj G. Gerlach J.H. Mackie J.E. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Stewart A.J. Kurz E.U. Duncan A.M. Deeley R.G. Science. 1992; 258: 1650-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar), and cannalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (37Fujii R. Mutoh M. Niwa K. Yamada K. Aikou T. Nakagawa M. Kuwano M. Akiyama S. Jpn. J. Can. Res. 1994; 85: 426-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), which extrude anticancer drugs, bile acids, and others. Expression of the efflux proteins in bacteria renders the organisms resistant to many antibiotics, organic solvents, hydrophobic dyes, and surfactants. Structure of the efflux pump in Gram-negative bacteria is particularly complicated, since the outer membrane covers the inner membrane. An extrusion pump in P. aeruginosa consisted of three subunits, MexA, MexB and OprM. Among them, MexB is particularly important in the pump function, since this subunit primarily recognizes and extrudes the substrates. To analyze the two-dimensional membrane topology of MexB, we constructed 26 phoA fusions, which covered the entire MexB protein. The NH2-terminal segment before the first hydrophobic segment consists of 9 amino acid residues containing 2 positively and 1 negatively charged residues. This segment is unlikely to cross the membrane according to the positive charge inside rule (38von Heijne G.C. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The periplasmic location of the Gln34 and Gly1007sites and the cytoplasmic location of the Pro9 and Gln1046 sites indicated that a cytoplasmic location of both the NH2- and COOH-terminal ends (Fig. 1). The hybrid protein Gln34 was detected in the crude envelope fraction (Fig. 2, lane 3) indicating that TMS1 is an uncleaved signal-anchor. The periplasmic location of the Glu346, Thr392, Thr473, Gln871, Ser921, and Gly1007 sites, and the cytoplasmic location of the Leu366, Val411, Gly440, Arg538, Pro897, and Pro972 sites verified the transmembrane nature of the TMS 2–11 (Fig. 1). Five weak hydrophobic segments suggested by the TOPRED II software (a–e, Fig. 1) did not function as transmembrane segments, because they were flanked by fusions with high AP activities (Fig. 1). These results supported our working model. Some of the computer programs for the topology prediction suggested the presence of 11 TMS in the MexB polypeptide. Our results experimentally ruled out this possibility. We carried out computer-aided alignment analysis of the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal halves of the polypeptide from Met1to Arg529 and Gly530 to Gln1046, respectively. Fig. 3 shows 30% homology between the first and second halves. TMS 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of the amino-terminal half could be overlaid by TMS 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the carboxyl-terminal half, respectively. This 2-fold repeat suggested that mexB is evolved from an ancestral gene encoding a protein of six TMS by an intragenic duplication as predicted earlier (13Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Saier Jr., M.H. Tam R. Reizer A. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This is to doubly support the transmembrane nature of the segments experimentally assigned to be the membrane-spanning domain. In addition, the distribution of positive charges in the cytoplasmic and periplasmic domains were 22 and 2, respectively, excepting the first and fourth large periplasmic domains with more than 60 amino acid residues (Fig. 1). The result was in accord with the positive inside rule (38von Heijne G.C. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3021-3027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is the first experimental verification of the transmembrane topology of the RND family extrusion pump protein. This experimentally verified model has the following features. (i) The MexB protein spans the membrane 12 times leaving amino and carboxyl termini at cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane as suggested for the RND family proteins (13Paulsen I.T. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 575-608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Saier Jr., M.H. Tam R. Reizer A. Reizer J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 841-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). (ii) MexB has two large hydrophilic segments with 311 and 314 amino acid residues from 29 to 338 (between TMS 1 and 2) and from 558 and 871 (between TMS 7 and 8), respectively. (iii) The membrane topology of MexB appeared to have a 2-fold repeat. These big loops might interact with the periplasmic subunit, MexA, and the outer membrane subunit, OprM. It is conceivable that these large loops transmit cellular energy to the OprM channel gate. In addition, we found 5 charged amino acid residues in the transmembrane domains. These charged residues were highly conserved in the RND family efflux proteins as aligned by the Clustal W multi-alignment software (data not shown). Specific localization of the highly conserved charged residues in the TMS suggested that they might play an important role in substrate binding and proton transport. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of these amino acid residues in the mechanism of xenobiotics extrusion. We acknowledge the preliminary participation of Weil EL-Naggar in this study."

Such an alternative structural state has been a central question to be solved for the understanding of the Fe3+ binding pathway in transferrin. A major difficulty encountered in the structural analysis for the intermediate is to prepare a stable protein form that reasonably mimics it. One of the most promising ways may be the site-directed mutagenesis approach for the amino acid residues that are implicated in the Fe3+ coordination. An Fe3+-loaded, domain-opened transferrin form, however, has not been obtained so far by site-directed mutagenesis; either the Asp- or His-ligand mutant of the lactoferrin N-lobe assumes the holo-like closed conformation (20Faber H.R. Bland T. Day C.L. Norris G.E. Tweedie J.W. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 352-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,21Nicholson H. Anderson B.F. Bland T. Shewry S.C. Tweedie J.W. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The mutant lactoferrin N-lobe in which the synergistic anion-binding residue, Arg121, is replaced by the serine or glutamic acid residue also assumes the closed conformation (22Faber H.R. Baker C.J. Day C.L. Tweedie J.W. Baker E.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14473-14479Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we employed an alternative strategy using an apo crystal: the Fe3+ soaking conditions in which the colorless crystal turns red without any collapse were searched. As a successful condition, an apo crystal of ovotransferrin N-lobe was soaked with the Fe3+·NTA1complex in the absence of CO32−, and then its structure was solved at a 2.1 Å resolution. We report here a novel structural state of transferrin: the Fe3+-loaded structure of ovotransferrin N-lobe with essentially the same open conformation as the apo form. In this structure, the bound iron atom is coordinated by the two protein ligands of Tyr92-OH and Tyr191-OH. Other Fe3+ coordination sites are occupied by a NTA anion, which is stabilized through the hydrogen bonds with protein groups. The observation strongly suggests that the two tyrosine residues are the initial Fe3+-binding ligands in the open transferrin. The isolated N-lobe (N-terminal half-molecule) of hen ovotransferrin was purified as described (23Oe H. Doi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1988; 103: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The apo form of the protein was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. A solution of a crystallization droplet was prepared on a siliconized coverslip by mixing 5 μl of protein solution (44.4 mg/ml in 0.05 m BisTris-HCl buffer, pH 6.0) with 5 μl of precipitant solution (0.05 m BisTris buffer, pH 6.0, 52% ammonium sulfate). The droplets were equilibrated against 1 ml of the precipitant solution at 20 °C. Hexagonal apo crystals were obtained within 1 month. For Fe3+ soaking, the apo crystals were first transferred to a precipitant solution at higher pH (0.05 m BisTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 52% ammonium sulfate) and then stepwise to raised precipitant concentrations (56, 62, 68, 74, and then 80% ammonium sulfate). The colorless crystals were incubated at 20 °C with 3.0 mm Fe3+·NTA for 4 h, thereby being transformed into red ones. Diffraction data were collected using CuKα radiation (= 1.5418 Å) with a Siemens Hi-Star area detector coupled to a rotating anode generator (Mac Science M18XHF). The crystal of the Fe3+-soaked form was found to belong to the same space group of P6322 (TableI) as that of the apo form. 188,024 reflections were collected to 2.09 Å.

Using the apo structure model and the diffraction data of the Fe3+-soaked form, refinement calculations were carried out by X-PLOR (24Brünger A.T. XPLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1993Google Scholar). One NTA molecule and one iron atom, which were identified from a clear difference density (Fo − Fc) map of the first refinement round, were included in the model, followed by more than 10 rounds of refinements and manual model buildings. The parameter and topology files of NTA for X-PLOR (24Brünger A.T. XPLOR Version 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1993Google Scholar) were prepared after building and energy minimization of NTA by QUANTA and CHARM (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA). The omit maps (2Fo − Fc, contoured at 1 ς and Fo − Fc, contoured at 3 ς) were obtained using the reflection data of the Fe3+-soaked form at 7.0–2.1 Å resolution after refinement of the model in which the NTA molecule was excluded. An anomalous difference Fourier density map contoured at 3 ς was calculated with a separate data set of the Fe3+-soaked form at 7.0–2.1 Å resolution with pair completeness of 95.8% by the program PHASES. The phases were calculated from the final model without an iron atom by X-PLOR and merged with the data by PHASES. The N-lobe of ovotransferrin comprises 332 amino acid residues (23Oe H. Doi E. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1988; 103: 1066-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Residues 1–3, however, are not included in the final model because no clearly interpretable electron density could be seen for these residues. In the final 2Fo − Fc electron density map, there is no break in the main chain density when contoured at the 1 ς level. Relevant refinement statistics are given in Table I. The overall completeness, R factor, and free-R value were 88.3%, 0.189, and 0.256, respectively, for the data more than 2 ς (F). For the highest resolution bin (2.10–2.19 Å), the completeness was 75.5%, and the R factor and free-R value were, respectively, 0.262 and 0.274. From a Luzzati plot, the mean absolute error in atomic position is estimated to be 0.24 Å. A Ramachandran plot (25Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys.

This leucine residue is the central residue in a γ-turn. The γ-turn of the equivalent leucine residue is the one conserved in all of the N- and C-lobes of serum transferrin (2Bailey S. Evans R.W.

The overall structure of the Fe3+-soaked form was almost exactly the same as that of the apo form. The root mean square deviation for 329 Cα atoms was only 0.19 Å. These structures, when compared with the holo (the Fe3+- and CO32−-loaded form) structure of ovotransferrin N-lobe (8Dewan J.C. Mikami B. Hirose M. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11963-11968Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), comprise a domain-opened conformation (Fig.2). The extent and mode of the opening were almost the same as in the N-lobes of the whole molecules of lactoferrin (11Anderson B.F. Baker H.M. Norris G.E. Rumball S.V. Baker E.N.

Biol. 1993; 234: 357-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the domains move 49.7° around a rotation axis passing through the two β-strands linking the domains. Another important observation in Fig. 2 is that an iron atom exists in the opened interdomain cleft of the Fe3+-soaked form. The two Fe3+-ligating tyrosine residues in the holo form (Tyr92 and Tyr191) appear also to participate in the iron coordination in the Fe3+-soaked form, whereas the other two protein ligands of Asp60 and His250 are located quite far from the iron atom. The Fe3+ binding structure was investigated in more details for the Fe3+-soaked form. Fig.3 a is a stereo diagram of the electron density map calculated with the exclusion of the NTA model (green, 2Fo − Fc;blue, Fo − Fc) for the Fe3+-soaked form. The figure clearly demonstrates the existence of iron and NTA close to the Tyr92 and Tyr191 ligands. To evaluate the existence of an iron atom by an alternative way, we calculated the anomalous difference Fourier density map with exclusion of an iron atom. As shown in Fig. 3 b (purple), the existence of iron atom is clearly confirmed by the highest anomalous difference Fourier peak in the density map. Fig. 4 a is a diagram displaying the iron coordination and hydrogen bonding structure in the Fe3+-soaked form. As summarized in TableII, the distances from the iron of Tyr92-OH and Tyr191-OH are 1.90 Å and 1.76 Å, respectively, indicating the Fe3+ coordination by these two tyrosine residues. The other two protein ligands of Asp60and His250, however, are not involved in the coordination of the iron atom: the distances of Asp60-OD1 and His250-NE2 from iron are 9.09 Å and 8.47 Å, respectively. Instead, at least three of the other four Fe3+ coordination sites are occupied by NTA; the distances from iron of NTA-O5, NTA-O8, and NTA-O12 are 2.03 Å, 1.73 Å, and 2.22 Å, respectively (Table II). The last coordination site may be weakly coordinated by NTA-N1 or almost vacant because the distance of this ligand from iron is a slightly larger value of 2.76 Å, compared with the other coordination distances (Table II). The bond angles formed among NTA-N1, iron, and NTA-O (O5, O8, or O12) are also significantly apart from the ideal 90° (Table II).Table IIGeometry of the iron binding siteBond lengths (Å)Fe-OH (Tyr92)1.90Fe-OH (Tyr191)1.76Fe-N1 (NTA)2.76Fe-O5 (NTA)2.03Fe-O8 (NTA)1.73Fe-O12 (NTA)2.22Bond angle (degrees)OH (Tyr92)-Fe-OH (Tyr191)106.5OH (Tyr92)-Fe-N1 (NTA)157.9OH (Tyr92)-Fe-O5 (NTA)96.2OH (Tyr92)-Fe-O8 (NTA)124.7OH (Tyr92)-Fe-O12 (NTA)96.8OH (Tyr191)-Fe-N1 (NTA)90.9OH (Tyr191)-Fe-O5 (NTA)154.1OH (Tyr191)-Fe-O8 (NTA)87.9OH (Tyr191)-Fe-O12 (NTA)87.2N1 (NTA)-Fe-O5 (NTA)64.2N1 (NTA)-Fe-O8 (NTA)68.0N1 (NTA)-Fe-O12 (NTA)70.1O5 (NTA)-Fe-O8 (NTA)89.2O5 (NTA)-Fe-O12 (NTA)77.8O8 (NTA)-Fe-O12 (NTA)137.7 Open table in a new tab The binding of NTA is stabilized through the interactions with the protein chains: NTA-O12 is hydrogen bonded to Ala123-N, and NTA-O13, to Thr117-OG1 and Gly124-N. These protein groups are the ones that form the hydrogen bonds with CO32− anion in the holo form (Fig.4 b). As a surprising observation, however, NTA has no direct interaction with the synergistic anion-binding residue, Arg121. Another difference in the protein-anion interactions is that the hydrogen bond of NTA-O4 to Ser122-N in the Fe3+-soaked form is replaced by that of Asp60-OD2 to Ser122-N in the holo form.

The structural pathway for the large conformational transition, however, has not been known. The current Fe3+-soaked structure provides crucial information about the structural mechanism for the Fe3+ binding. For loading Fe3+ to apotransferrin (apo-Trf), a ferric chelate, most widely ferric NTA (Fe3+·NTA), is employed (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The binding reaction yields a ternary complex consisting of transferrin, Fe3+, and NTA molecules (Trf·Fe3+·NTA) (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 28Schlabach M.R. Bates G.W. J. Biol.

In the presence of a high concentration of bicarbonate, however, NTA is replaced by CO32−; this reaction yields the physiological holo form consisting of transferrin, Fe3+, and CO32−(Trf·Fe3+·CO32−) (1Aisen P. Listowsky I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 357-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar,28Schlabach M.R. Bates G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2182-2188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trf·Fe3+·NTA+CO32−⇌Trf·Fe3+·CO32−+NTAEquation EReaction_2 The current crystal structure of the Fe3+-soaked form demonstrates essentially the same open conformation as apo-Trf, whereas Trf·Fe3+·CO32− assumes the closed one (Fig. 2). About the implications of the Fe3+-soaked structure for the iron binding pathway, two different mechanisms may be possible. In the first mechanism, Trf·Fe3+·NTA assumes the same conformation in solution as the Fe3+-soaked structure, and the total domain closure occurs in Reaction 2. In this mechanism, the domain closure should depend on the anion replacement. The Trf·Fe3+·NTA complex shares the two protein ligands (Tyr92 and Tyr191 residues) with Trf·Fe3+·CO32− (Fig.4). Nevertheless, some structural modulations in the iron binding site, other than the protein ligand structures, appear to be highly relevant to the structural mechanism in Reaction 2. As displayed in Fig.4 b, CO32− forms hydrogen bonds with Thr117-OG1, Ala123-N, and Gly124-N in the holo form; these protein groups are all hydrogen bonded to carboxylate groups of NTA in the Fe3+-soaked form (Fig. 4 a). The protein group Ser122-N that forms a hydrogen bond with Asp60-OD2 in the holo form also forms a hydrogen bond with NTA-O4 in the Fe3+-soaked form. However, Arg121-NE and -NH2, which are the anchor sites for CO32− in the holo form, are both vacant in the Fe3+-soaked form. Such an open situation would be suitable for the subsequent entry of CO32− in Reaction 2. Our putative pathway for Reaction 2 includes an initial entry of CO32− into the Arg121anchor sites and then the total replacement of NTA by CO32−. This reaction should yield a short lived Trf·Fe3+·CO32− complex with the open conformation, in which only four of the six Fe3+ coordination sites are occupied by the protein side chains (Tyr92 and Tyr191) and bidentate CO32−. As a structural counterpart, the crystal structure of a domain 2 fragment complex, in which all parts of domain 1 as well as the aspartic acid and histidine ligands are deleted by proteolysis, demonstrates the presence of an equivalent Fe3+ coordination structure by the two tyrosine residues and CO32− (29Lindley P.F. Bajaj M. Evans R.W. Garratt R.C. Hasnain S.S. Jhoti H. Kuser P. Neu M. Patel K. Sarra R. Strange R. Walton A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 292-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of the holo structure is then completed by the coordination of Asp60 and His250 ligands to the two vacant Fe3+ sites and hence by the domain closure. In the second mechanism, the Fe3+-soaked form is initially transformed into a closed conformation by the Fe3+coordination of Asp60 and His250 ligands, before the bound NTA molecule is replaced by a carbonate anion. This mechanism, however, requires as a prerequisite the occurrence, in solution, of the differential ternary Trf·Fe3+·NTA complex with the closed conformation in a carbonate-free condition; the maintenance of the open conformation in the Fe3+-soaked form is accounted for by the arrest due to a crystal packing force from otherwise (free in solution) induced transformation into the closed conformation. The mechanism would also require a rearranged coordination and hydrogen bonding structure for NTA in the Trf·Fe3+·NTA complex because the Asp60 and His250 coordination sites are occupied by NTA in the Fe3+-soaked form (Figs. 3 and 4). As a related observation to the second mechanism, no clear diffraction has been detected for the apo crystal when it is soaked with Fe3+·NTA in the presence of a high concentration of bicarbonate. This strongly suggests that the apo crystal collapses upon the transformation of the open form into the closed Trf·Fe3+·CO32−. The crystal packing force, therefore, may not be strong enough to arrest the transformation of the open to closed conformation, giving less weight to the second mechanism. At the present stage, however, the second mechanism, which includes a ternary Trf·Fe3+·NTA complex with a holo-like closed conformation in solution cannot be ruled out because the structure of the Trf·Fe3+·NTA complex in solution has not been solved. In conclusion, the previous crystallographic structures of transferrins have been restricted essentially to the two structural forms: one is the domain-opened, iron-free apo form and the other, the domain-closed, Fe3+-loaded holo form (2Bailey S.

As an alternative structural state, the current Fe3+-soaked structure of the ovotransferrin N-lobe is the first demonstration of an Fe3+-loaded, open transferrin form. One of the most important findings in the current structure is that only the two tyrosine residues (Try92 and Tyr191) participate in the Fe3+ coordination as protein ligands (Figs. 3 and 4 and Table II). The coordination structure by the two tyrosine residues is consistent with the previous hypothetical structure for the Fe3+-loaded, domain-opened transferrin intermediate (19Baker E.N. Lindley P.F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); the hypothetical structure has been derived from the crystallographic data of the iron-loaded domain N2 fragment of duck ovotransferrin in which the Asp and His ligands, but not the two Tyr ligands, are removed by proteolysis (29Lindley P.F. Bajaj M. Evans R.W. Garratt R.C. Hasnain S.S. Jhoti H. Kuser P. Neu M. Patel K. Sarra R. Strange R. Walton A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1993; 49: 292-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of whether the Trf·Fe3+·NTA complex assumes the open or closed conformation in solution, the finding that the overall structure of the Fe3+-soaked form is almost indistinguishable from that of the apo form (Fig. 2) is consistent with the view that the two tyrosine residues are the protein ligands for the Fe3+ entry in the intact transferrin lobe with the domain-opened conformation.

Examination of the single-site mutants revealed that PDGF effects were not mediated via a single signaling component. This was confirmed by the “add-back” mutants, which showed that restoration of either SHP-2 or PLCγ1 binding was sufficient to propagate the GJC inhibitory actions of PDGF. Further analysis showed that activation of PLCγ1 is involved in Cx43 phosphorylation, which surprisingly failed to correlate with GJC blockade.

In the case of PDGFRβ, critical phosphotyrosine residues include Tyr-579 and Tyr-581 (for Src), Tyr-716 (Grb2), Tyr-740 and Tyr-751 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)), Tyr-751 (Nck), Tyr-771 (GTPase-activating protein (GAP)), Tyr-1009 (protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ)), and Tyr-1021 (PLCγ) (1Claesson-Welsh L.

Many of these signal transduction molecules possess intrinsic catalytic properties (e.g. PI3K, PLCγ, etc.) or act as adaptors (e.g. Grb2) to link other molecules with enzymatic properties. Following recruitment and activation, these molecules initiate specific cascades of events to propagate the signal resulting in a particular biological response. Examination of PDGFR mutants lacking single or multiple tyrosine residues provided useful clues regarding the roles of individual signaling molecules modulating various biological end points of PDGF treatment (6Valius M.

In addition to inducing biological events such as mitogenesis, cell migration, etc., PDGF is also a strong inhibitor of intercellular communication via gap junctions, or gap junctional communication (GJC) (13Maldonado P.E.

Carcinogenesis (Lond.). 1991; 12: 2109-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) are considered to be critical for augmenting their respective effects. To study the mechanism of PDGF-induced disruption of GJC, we have developed a cell system derived from T51B rat liver epithelial cells (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which are devoid of any endogenous PDGFR expression, but are GJC-competent and express high levels of a gap junctional protein, connexin-43 (Cx43). Following retroviral infection with a construct containing wild-type PDGFRβ cDNA, these cells (Kin+) showed a PDGF-induced rapid and transient interruption of GJC and a concomitant phosphorylation of Cx43 presumably at serine/threonine residues (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Cx43 is believed to be causally linked with the disruption of GJC (31Lau A.F. Kurata W.E. Kanetmitsu M.Y. Loo L.W.M. Warn-Cramer B.J. Eckhart W. Lampe P.D. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our subsequent study revealed that a sequential activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was required for mediating these PDGF effects (16Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although MAPK was shown to be the kinase mediating the epidermal growth factor-induced phosphorylation of Cx43 (32Warn-Cramer B.J. Lampe P.D. Kurata W.F. Kanemitsu M.Y. Loo L.W.M. Eckhart W. Lau A.F.

Z., Jagdale, A. B., Ao, P., and Boynton, A. L., (1999) J. Cell. Physiol., in press. 2Hossain, M. Z., Jagdale, A. B., Ao, P., and Boynton, A. L., (1999) J. Cell. Physiol., in press. These results indicate that inhibition of GJC requires the participation of multiple components, including protein kinases and Cx43-associated proteins. Since PDGFR activation leads to multiple signaling pathways (1Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar), we wished to determine the contribution of each signaling pathway in the disruption of GJC. To achieve this goal, a series of PDGFR mutants lacking single or multiple Tyr residues (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) were expressed in T51B cells. Our results indicate that PDGF-induced disruption of GJC is mediated via multiple pathways. T51B is a non-neoplastic epithelial cell line derived from rat liver, the origin of which has been described (35Swierenga S.H.H. Whitfield J.F. Boynton A.L. MacManus J.P. Rixon R.H. Sikorska M. Tsang B.K. Walker P.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1980; 349: 294-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and has been widely used for various studies (23Lau A.F. Kanemitsu M.Y. Kurata W.E.

The cells were grown to confluence in a complete medium consisting of 90% Eagle's basal medium and 10% bovine calf serum (Colorado Serum Co., Denver, CO) and were maintained in Eagle's basal medium alone for 18 h before treatment with PDGF (5 ng/ml, unless specified). Recombinant human PDGF-BB was a kind gift from Dr. C. Hart (Zymogenetics, Seattle, WA), and U73122 was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal anti-PDGFRβ antibody was a generous gift from Dr. C. Hart; polyclonal anti-PDGFRβ antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-Cx43 antibody was raised in rabbits by injecting a peptide corresponding to the last 16 amino acids of the C-terminal region of the Cx43 sequence (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Antibodies against SHP-2, p85PI3K, and GAP and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and anti-PLCγ antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-MAPK (PMAPK) were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA) and Promega (Madison, WI). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). The virus-packaging PA317 cell lines expressing wild-type, kinase-dead, and single-site mutant human PDGFRβ cDNAs subcloned into pLXSN retroviral vector (38Kazlauskas A. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. J. Cooper (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). Generation of the F5 and “add-back” mutants has been previously described (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Culture medium from the virus-packaging cells was used to infect T51B cells. Following selection with G418, populations of infected cells were obtained. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting techniques were utilized to confirm the expression of functional PDGFR in these cells (see “Results”). Gap junctional communication was assessed by transfer of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow after single-cell microinjection performed as described previously (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, glass micropipettes were prepared using a Flaming/Brown micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Nevato, CA) and back-filled with 10% solution of Lucifer yellow in 0.33m LiCl. Injection of cells in confluent cultures was achieved with pressure delivery by an Eppendorf microinjector. The cells were observed under a fluorescence inverted microscope, and after 5–7 min of microinjection, the number of neighboring cells exhibiting dye labeling was recorded. For each treatment group, a minimum of 20–30 cells in different areas of the cultures were microinjected. Each experiment was conducted at least three times. The mean number of communicating cells ± S.D. was calculated for each mutant or treatment group. The values of S.D. (data not shown) were typically <10% of the mean values. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture dishes containing confluent cells were quickly washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mmEDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then harvested in the same solution. The cell pellets were lysed in 1 mm NaHCO3 containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. An equal amount (5–10 μg) of lysate protein was resolved on polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). After blocking for 16 h at 4 °C in a solution consisting of 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6 and 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.2% Tween 20, membranes were incubated with anti-Cx43 antibody for 1–2 h at room temperature. The membranes were then washed several times in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and processed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). For anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-PMAPK antibodies, 1% bovine serum albumin was used during the blocking and antibody incubation steps. To detect recruitment of signal transduction proteins by activated PDGFR, confluent cells were treated with PDGF for 10 min and lysed with solubilizing buffer (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 39Huang R.P. Wu J.X. Fan Y. Adamson E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 211-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm EDTA in Hepes-buffered saline (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates, obtained after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min, were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal anti-PDGFRβ antibody (5 μg/ml). The immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech AB, Uppsala, Sweden). After washing three times with solubilizing buffer and once with Hepes-buffered saline, the immunoprecipitated material was eluted by boiling with 40 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 2% β-mercaptoethanol. Equal volumes were loaded for SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above. To verify PDGFR activation of PDGF-treated cells, membranes were incubated with antibodies recognizing phosphotyrosine, PLCγ, p85PI3K, SHP-2, or GAP followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and processed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit. In our previous study, we demonstrated a PDGF-induced Cx43 phosphorylation and GJC blockade in T51B cells expressing wild-type PDGFRβ (Kin+) (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These effects were not observed in Kin− cells expressing kinase-inactive PDGFRβ, indicating that phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in PDGFRβ is required for PDGF-induced GJC blockade and Cx43 phosphorylation. As illustrated in previous studies, tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFR is required for the activation and recruitment of various signaling molecules, which lead to induction of various protein kinases and phosphatases (1Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Requirement of such signaling cascades in the PDGF-induced GJC blockade and Cx43 phosphorylation was recently demonstrated by showing that these two effects were dependent on the activation of two PDGF-induced kinases, namely PKC and MAPK (16Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our subsequent study showed that factors additional to MAPK are also required,2which suggests that PDGF-induced GJC blockade possibly involves multiple components. To define these components of the PDGF signaling pathway, our experimental strategy involves expression of a series of PDGFRβ mutants in which single or multiple tyrosine residues were altered to phenylalanines in our T51B cell system, which is devoid of any detectable expression of PDGFRβ (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and does not show any PDGF-induced GJC blockade (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), activation of MAPK (16Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), or mitogenesis or Ca2+ entry. 3A. Golard, M. Z. Hossain, R. P. Huang, A. Kazlauskas, and A. L. Boynton, unpublished data. Since these tyrosine residues, following phosphorylation, form binding sites for specific signal transduction molecules (1Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), substitution of these Tyr residues with Phe will prevent signaling cascades initiated by these signaling molecules. This approach allows us to examine the contribution of a particular tyrosine and the corresponding signaling molecule in the regulation of GJC/Cx43 by PDGF. Similar strategies have identified the requirement of PI3K and PLCγ in PDGF-induced mitogenesis and neoplastic cell transformation (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar,10DeMali K.A. Whiteford C.C. Ulug E.T. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9011-9018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We first infected T51B cells with the F5 construct containing tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations at positions 740/751, 771, 1009, and 1021, which are required for the recruitment of PI3K, GAP, SHP-2, and PLCγ1, respectively (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Our rationale was that by first examining the F5 mutant, we could either confirm or eliminate the involvement of the mutated tyrosine residues in the modulation of GJC/Cx43 by PDGF. In case of a successful PDGF signal propagation, remaining tyrosines such as Tyr-579 and Tyr-581 (Src site) and Tyr-716 (Grb2 site) would be examined. On the other hand, if F5 failed to modulate GJC/Cx43 after PDGF treatment, the involvement of each tyrosine substituted in this mutant would be investigated. Generation of the mutant F5 cDNA construct and its introduction into virus-packaging PA317 cells and infection of T51B cells were achieved as described previously (6Valius M. Kazlauskas A. Cell. 1993; 73: 321-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Following G418 selection, expression of the F5 mutant in infected T51B cells was confirmed (data not shown) by Western blotting performed with anti-PDGFRβ antibody (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To verify the functionality of the F5 mutant, PDGFRβ was immunoprecipitated from control and PDGF-treated cells and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with various antibodies recognizing PDGFR-associated proteins (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In Fig.1, we show that tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions in the F5 mutant did not impair its receptor tyrosine kinase activity, being of similar magnitude between Kin+(wild type) and F5 cells. As expected, recruitment of GAP, PLCγ1, or PI3K (Fig. 1) or SHP-2 (data not shown) by the activated receptor was completely abolished in the F5 mutant. This finding demonstrates that the F5 mutant is deficient in initiating pathways via these signaling molecules. After the confirmation of the characteristics of the mutant receptor, F5 and wild-type Kin+ cells were treated with PDGF (5 ng/ml) for 20 min and then analyzed for GJC by dye microinjection and for Cx43 by Western blotting. As observed previously (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,16Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar),2 PDGF treatment caused a total disruption of GJC in Kin+ cells (Fig.2 A). In contrast, GJC in F5 cells was not significantly influenced by the same treatment, indicating that one or more of the substituted tyrosine residues are involved in PDGF-induced disruption of GJC. In a separate experiment, F5 cells failed to show any disruption of GJC even when treated with a higher (10 ng/ml) PDGF concentration for a longer (40 min) length of time (data not shown), which suggested that the absence of PDGF action in F5 cells was due to the deleted tyrosine residues rather than a submaximal activation of the signaling pathways. Since inhibition of GJC was linked with the phosphorylation of Cx43 (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 174: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 16Hossain M.Z.

Biomembr. 1996; 28: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we next compared phosphorylation profiles of Cx43 in Kin+and F5 cells. Untreated Kin+ or F5 cells contain three characteristic Cx43 protein bands representing a minor, non-phosphorylated form (Cx43-NP) and two highly abundant, phosphorylated forms (Cx43-P1 and Cx43-P2). Whereas the former form represents nascent, predominantly cytoplasmic Cx43, the post-translationally modified latter forms are believed to be required for the assembly of functional gap junctional channels (40Musil L.S. Cunningham B.A. Edelman G.A. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2077-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). As previously reported (15Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell.

In accord with the GJC data, PDGF treatment failed to generate any distinct high molecular mass Cx43 forms in F5 cells, indicating a lack of activation of the responsible Cx43/kinase system. Since activation of MAPK has been shown to be required for PDGF-induced Cx43 phosphorylation and GJC blockade (16Hossain M.Z. Ao P. Boynton A.L. J. Cell. P"

However, the cellular mechanism(s) mediating integrin signaling remain poorly understood. We demonstrate here that treatment of keratinocytes cultured on type I collagen with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blocking antibodies or a specific receptor antagonist inhibited cell migration across type I collagen and the matrix-directed stimulation of collagenase-1 production. Additionally, stimulation of collagenase-1 expression by hepatocyte growth factor, transforming growth factor-β1, and interferon-γ was blocked by EGFR inhibitors, suggesting a required EGFR autocrine signaling step for enzyme expression. Collagenase-1 mRNA was not detectable in keratinocytes isolated immediately from normal skin, but increased progressively following 2 h of contact with collagen. In contrast, EGFR mRNA was expressed at high steady-state levels in keratinocytes isolated immediately from intact skin but was absent following 2 h cell contact with collagen, suggesting down-regulation following receptor activation. Indeed, tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR was evident as early as 10 min following cell contact with collagen. Treatment of keratinocytes cultured on collagen with EGFR antagonist or heparin-binding (HB)-EGF neutralizing antibodies dramatically inhibited the sustained expression (6–24 h) of collagenase-1 mRNA, whereas initial induction by collagen alone (2 h) was unaffected. Finally, expression of collagenase-1 in ex vivo wounded skin and re-epithelialization of partial thickness porcine burn wounds was blocked following treatment with EGFR inhibitors. These results demonstrate that keratinocyte contact with type I collagen is sufficient to induce collagenase-1 expression, whereas sustained enzyme production requires autocrine EGFR activation by HB-EGF as an obligatory intermediate step, thereby maintaining collagenase-1-dependent migration during the re-epithelialization of epidermal wounds.

Among these, effective proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM)1 macromolecules is thought to be necessary to remodel the damaged tissue, promote neovascularization, and facilitate efficient migration of cells during re-epithelialization (1Mignatti P.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) constitute a family of zinc-dependent enzymes with the collective capacity to degrade virtually all ECM components (2$$Google Scholar). Although most MMPs can degrade many ECM proteins with overlapping substrate specificities, degradation of fibrillar type I collagen is initiated only by the catalytic activity of collagenases, a subgroup of the MMP gene family. Previous studies from our group and others have shown that, in both normally healing wounds and chronic ulcers, basal keratinocytes at the leading edge of re-epithelialization invariantly express collagenase-1 (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S.

Although much is known about the role of cell:matrix interactions regulating collagenase-1 expression by keratinocytes, the signaling mechanism(s) following collagen binding and integrin receptor occupancy remain poorly understood. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR; c-erbB1/HER1) is a transmembrane cell-surface tyrosine kinase that, upon ligand binding, phosphorylates downstream effector molecules, leading to changes in cell function (12van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). EGFR-null mice demonstrate involvement of the receptor in a broad range of developmental processes, and these mice have pronounced defects in epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation (13Miettinen P.

Science. 1995; 269: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Activation of the EGFR by members of the EGF family of growth factors (i.e. EGF, TGF-α, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin) is associated with multiple keratinocyte functions during wound repair, including cell proliferation, migration, and stimulation of α2β1 integrin expression (16Chen J. Kim J. Zhang K. Sarret Y. Wynn K. Kramer R. Woodley D. Exp. Cell. Res. 1993; 209: 216-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 17Nanney L. King J.L.E. Clark R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996: 171-194Google Scholar). Keratinocyte migration is essential for effective re-epithelialization, and expression of the EGFR and its ligands is up-regulated following injury in vivo (17Nanney L. King J.L.E. Clark R.

Indeed, exogenously administered EGFR ligands (EGF, TGF-α) stimulate keratinocyte motility in vitro and re-epithelialization in vivo (19Ju W. Schiller J. Kazempour M. Lowy D. J. Invest.

Science. 1987; 235: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and wound healing-specific keratins (K6 and K16) contain upstream regulatory sequences responsive to EGFR activation (24Jiang C.-K. Magnaldo T. Ohtsuki M. Freedberg I. Bernerd F. Blumenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6786-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Furthermore, EGFR overexpression in cultured keratinocytes enhances ligand-mediated motility (25McCawley L. O'Brien P. Hudson L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Autocrine signaling mechanisms often regulate cell function and behavior, and, in keratinocytes, autocrine activation of the EGFR can influence epithelial homeostasis and cutaneous repair. Indeed, recent evidence from Stoll et al. (51Stoll S. Garner W. Elder J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) demonstrates that heparin-binding ligands, namely HB-EGF and amphiregulin, mediate autocrine activation of the EGFR in a skin organ culture model, suggesting that these ligands play an important role in the amplification and transmission of the wound healing signal. Because collagenase-1 production is tyrosine kinase-dependent (11Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30022-30029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because keratinocytes express both the EGFR and its various ligands during wound repair, we reasoned that an autocrine loop mechanism may regulate keratinocyte collagenase-1 expression following α2β1 integrin-mediated collagen binding. Here, we report that the initial induction of collagenase-1 by keratinocytes following contact with type I collagen requires only integrin receptor activation. However, autocrine activation of the EGFR by HB-EGF is required for the sustained expression of collagenase-1 by keratinocytesin vitro and during the full re-epithelialization processin vivo.

Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (PY-20) and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. Bovine type I collagen (Vitrogen-100) was obtained from Celltrix Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA. Human keratinocytes were harvested from healthy adult skin from reduction mammoplasties or abdominoplasties as described (11Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol.

Briefly, the subcutaneous fat and deep dermis were removed, and the remaining tissue was incubated in 0.25% trypsin in PBS. After 16 h, the epidermis was separated from the dermis with forceps, and the keratinocytes were scraped into DMEM. The keratinocyte suspension was added to fresh DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin. Under these culture conditions, keratinocytes proliferate, migrate, differentiate, and cornify similarly to cellsin vivo (29Pentland A.P. Needleman P. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). A specified amount of keratinocyte suspension was then plated onto tissue culture dishes coated with 1 mg/ml type I collagen, which is necessary for induction of collagenase-1 and keratinocyte adhesion (5Saarialho-Kere U.K. Vaalamo M.

Collagenase-1 mRNA was detected in formalin-fixed tissue samples by hybridization with 35S-labeled antisense RNA as described (30Prosser I.W. Stenmark K.R. Suthar M. Crouch E.C. Mecham R.P. Parks W.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 1073-1088PubMed Google Scholar, 31Saarialho-Kere U.K. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17354-17361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Punch biopsies (2 mm) of human skin were obtained and grown as explant cultures in serum-containing DMEM for 4 days. Following treatment, the tissue was fixed in neutral buffered formalin for 24 h followed by washing in PBS and dehydration in graded ethanol. Sections of tissue were hybridized with 2.5 × 104 cpm/μl 35S-labeled antisense or sense RNA overnight at 57 °C. After hybridization the slides were washed under stringent conditions, including RNase A treatment, and were processed for autoradiography. After development of the photographic emulsion, slides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin. The specificity of the antisense RNA probe for collagenase-1 and the complete lack of reactivity by the sense probe have been demonstrated in previous studies (3Saarialho-Kere U.K. Chang E.S. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 7Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Primary human keratinocytes (1 × 104 cells) were plated within a siliconized cloning cylinder (6-mm inner diameter; BellCo Glass, Inc., Vineland, NJ) onto collagen-coated dishes. After a 24-h incubation period to allow the cells to attach and become confluent, the cloning cylinder was removed, and cell colonies were allowed to migrate for 96 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Keratinocytes were fixed in neutral buffered formalin, stained with 1.5% Coomassie Blue, and the area of the colony was determined by digitized scanning analysis. Migration is expressed as the increase in colony area relative to 0-h controls. Primary human keratinocytes were plated on chamber slides precoated with a mixture of 100 μg/ml type I collagen and colloidal gold particles in serum-containing DMEM. Keratinocytes (∼330 cells) were added to each chamber, and 20 min later, non-adherent cells were removed and the medium was replaced. Twenty hours after plating, cultures were fixed in 1× Histochoice tissue fixative (Amresco, Solon, OH), washed in PBS, and dehydrated through graded ethanol. Paths of cell migration (phagokinetic tracks) were identified as areas devoid of gold particles. A migration index was determined using image analysis software by measuring the area of the phagokinetic tracks associated with cells in randomly chosen fields under dark field illumination at 100× magnification. For each experiment, all conditions were done in triplicate, and all experiments were repeated at least three times with keratinocytes from individual donors. The amount of collagenase-1 accumulated in keratinocyte conditioned medium was measured by indirect competitive ELISA (32Cooper T.W. Bauer E.A. Eisen A.Z. Collagen Relat. Res. 1982; 3: 205-211Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This ELISA is completely specific for collagenase-1, has nanogram sensitivity, and detects active and zymogen enzyme forms, as well as collagenase-1 bound to TIMP or bound to substrate. Results were obtained from triplicate determinations and were normalized to total cell protein as quantified by the BCA protein assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Post-confluent keratinocytes plated on type I collagen were cultured for 24 h in the presence of serum-containing DMEM control or experimental solutions. The culture wells were then washed and replaced with methionine-free DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (to remove free amino acids), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm each of non-essential amino acids, 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN Radiochemicals, Irvine CA), and the identical concentrations of experimental reagents. Conditioned medium was collected 24 h later and analyzed by immunoprecipitation. A specific polyclonal antiserum (33Stricklin G.P. Eisen A.Z. Bauer E.A. Jeffrey J.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2331-2337Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was used to immunoprecipitate collagenase-1 from keratinocyte conditioned medium as described (34Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Bar-Shavit Z. Senior R.M. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate the EGFR, cell layers were washed with PBS and treated for 10 min at room temperature with cell lysis buffer (1.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02 mg/ml aprotinin, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin). All samples were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), and supernatants were incubated with collagenase-1 or EGFR polyclonal (35Gullick W.J. Downward J. Parker P.J. Whittle N. Kris R. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. Waterfield M.D. Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose and washed extensively. For visualization of collagenase-1, radiolabeled protein was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by fluorography as described previously (36Pilcher B. Gaither-Ganim J. Parks W. Welgus H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18147-18154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated EGFR was resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR was then visualized by incubating the membrane with anti-PY-20 (primary) and anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (secondary) antibodies followed by detection using the ECL system (Amersham Corp., Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total incorporated radioactivity (new protein synthesis) was determined from keratinocyte conditioned medium by trichloroacetic acid precipitation as described previously (37Dunsmore S.E. Rubin J.S.

The 5′-sense primer was complementary to bases 791–810 in exon 4, and the 3′-antisense primer was complementary to bases 1017–1036 in exon 6 of human HB-EGF (40Fen Z. Dhadly M.S. Yoshizumi M.

These primers amplify a fragment across three exons; thus, the 246-base pair cDNA produced from HB-EGF mRNA would be easily distinguished from contaminating DNA or preprocessed mRNA. In addition, all resultant cDNAs from each of the primer pairs contain restriction sites specific to the mRNA amplified and each product was subjected to digestion analysis to verify specificity. The primers used to amplify each mRNA, annealing temperatures, and resulting product sizes are listed in TableI.Table ISpecifications for collagenase-1 (C'ase-1), EGF, TGF-α, amphiregulin (AR), HB-EGF, EGFR, and GAPDH RT-PCRTranscriptForward primerReverse primerAnnealing temperatureProduct length°Cbase pairsC'ase-15′-GGACTCACACCATGTGTTTTCC-3′5′-GGGCTGTTCAGGGACAGAATGT-3′60400EGF5′-AAGATGACCACCACTATTCCG-3′5′-AGCGTGGCGCAGTTCCCACCA-3′45253TGF-α5′-ATGGTCCCCTCGGCTGGACA-3′5′-CTGCAGGTTCCATGGAAGCA-3′58182AR5′-CAGTCAGAGTTGAACAGG-3′5′-GCTGTGAGTTTTCATGGA-3′50268HB-EGF5′-TGTCTGTCTGCTGGTCATCG-3′5′-CAATCCTAGACGGCAACTGG-3′55246EGFR5′-CGCTGCTGGCTGCGCTCTG-3′5′-AGCCACCTCCTGGATGGTC-3′45221GAPDH5′-CTGAGAACGGGAAGCTTGTCATCAA-3′5′-GCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATGTC-3′55610 Open table in a new tab Total RNA was isolated from cultured keratinocytes by phenol-chloroform extraction (41Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar) and treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to remove any contaminating DNA as described (42Swee M.H. Parks W.C. Pierce R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14899-14906Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). DNase-treated RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers using kit reagents and under the manufacturer's recommended conditions (GeneAmp RNA PCR kit, Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT). Signal strength for each RT-PCR cDNA product increased exponentially between 21 and 29 cycles using 10 ng of DNase-treated RNA and increased linearly between 1 and 25 ng of total RNA at 25 cycles. To amplify each mRNA, we used 10 ng of total RNA and 25 cycles. PCR products were separated through a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Specificity was determined by overnight transfer to Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Corp.) followed by Southern hybridization with a radiolabeled product-specific oligonucleotide probe (EGF family members and EGFR) or radiolabeled cDNA probes (collagenase-1 and GAPDH). The probes used to detect EGF family members and EGFR transcripts following RT-PCR were developed to recognize only specific sequences that were amplified in the PCR reaction. For each oligonucleotide, a BLAST search was performed, and no sequence similarity to other known cDNAs was found. In addition, a parallel reaction was run without reverse transcriptase to assure that products were not generated by contaminating DNA. Oligonucleotide probes were labeled by terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim), and cDNA probes were labeled by random priming (Amersham Corp.) with [α–32P]dCTP (ICN Radiochemicals). Following hybridization, the membranes were washed and exposed to x-ray film for an appropriate duration. Expression constructs contained the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene with a 2.2-kilobase pair fragment of the human collagenase-1 promoter, pCLCAT (provided by Dr. Steven Frisch, Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA), and pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega, Madison, WI). Primary keratinocytes were transfected at 50% confluence with 2 μg/well of each construct using 10 μl/well LipofectAMINE (LifeTechnologies, Inc.). After 16 h, the medium was replaced, and the cells were incubated with control or experimental solutions for an additional 24 h and harvested. Detection of β-galactosidase and CAT activity was performed as described previously (37Dunsmore S.E. Rubin J.S. Kovacs S.O. Chedid M. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. J. Biol.

Curtsinger I.L. Brightwell J.R. Ackerman D.M. Tobin G.R. Polk J.H.C. George-Nascimento C. Valenzuela P. Schultz G.S. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 163: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Briefly, two domestic male pigs, each weighing 35 pounds, were anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine, and anesthesia was maintained with halothane inhalation. The dorsal skin was chemically depilitated, and six partial thickness burns measuring 3 × 3 cm were created by contact for 10 s with a solid brass block weighing 714 g heated previously in a water bath maintained at 70 °C. The six burns were arranged in two rows of three burns on each side of the spine. Blister roofs were removed and two burns were treated topically with 3 ml of Silvadene® cream (Marion Laboratories, Kansas City, MO) containing 20 μg/ml tyrphostin 1478 (Calbiochem) (44Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two burns were treated with Silvadene®cream alone, and two burns were left untreated. Each burn was individually covered with a 6 × 6-cm2 adhesive occlusive dressing (Steri-Drape™ 2, 3M, St. Paul, MN). Dressings were removed daily, the burns were retreated, and fresh dressings were applied. Five days after injury, the pigs were sacrificed and a full-thickness biopsy was taken diagonally across each burn, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The extent of epithelial healing for each burn was calculated by measuring the distance between intact e"

The novel Ets protein was most closely related to PU.1 and Spi-B within the DNA binding Ets domain and was therefore named Spi-C. However, Spi-C may represent a novel subgroup within the Ets protein family, as it differed significantly from Spi-B and PU.1 within helix 1 of the Ets domain. Spi-C was encoded by a single-copy gene that was mapped to chromosome 10, region C. Spi-C interacted with DNA similarly to PU.1 as judged by methylation interference, band-shift and site selection analysis, and activated transcription of a κY element reporter gene upon co-transfection of HeLa cells. Spi-C RNA was expressed in mature B lymphocytes and at lower levels in macrophages. Furthermore, pre-B cell and plasma cell lines were Spi-C-negative, suggesting that Spi-C might be a regulatory molecule during a specific phase of B lymphoid development.

Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). At present around 20 distinct proteins within the family have been described, and all these bind to a similar, purine-rich DNA sequence element (1Wasylyk B. Hahn S.L. Giovane A. Eur. J.

Given the similarity of their binding sites, and given that several of the proteins have overlapping pattern of expression, it has been difficult to define the individual function of each Ets protein. However, gene targeting experiments in mice have shown that Ets proteins are not functionally redundant (3Su G.H. Ip H.S. Cobb B.S. Lu M.M. Chen H.M. Simon M.C. J. Exp.

In the B lymphoid lineage, several of the Ets proteins are expressed; among these are Ets-1 (7Watson D.K. McWilliams M.J. Lapis P. Lautenberger J.A. Schweinfest C.W. Papas T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Ets-1, elf-1, and Spi-B are also expressed in T cells (3Su G.H. Ip H.S. Cobb B.S. Lu M.M. Chen H.M. Simon M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 8Bhat N.K.

Hence, a binding site for Ets-1 has been found in the Ig heavy chain intron enhancer (14Nelsen B. Tian G. Erman B. Gregoire J. Maki R. Graves B. Sen R. Science. 1993; 261: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), while binding sites for elf-1 have been found in the Ig heavy chain 3′ enhancer (15Grant P.A. Thompson C.B. Pettersson S.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2006-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, no target genes for PU.1 that can explain the phenotype observed in PU.1−/− animals have been identified. Spi-B is closely related to PU.1, and no clear difference between the binding sequences of the two proteins has been defined (2Ray-Gallet D. Mao C. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 303-313PubMed Google Scholar). As the expression pattern between PU.1 and Spi-B is overlapping within the B cell lineage (3Su G.H. Ip H.S. Cobb B.S. Lu M.M. Chen H.M. Simon M.C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it would not be surprising should the two proteins be functionally redundant. However, this is not the case, since, although PU.1−/− mice have a severe distortion of hematopoietic development (5McKercher S.R. Torbett B.E. Anderson K.L. Henkel G.W. Vestal D.J. Baribault H.

Here we describe the cloning and characterization of a novel Ets family protein, Spi-C, which was identified in an yeast one-hybrid screen due to its interaction with the SP6 κ promoter κY element. The protein is mainly expressed in the peripheral B lymphoid compartment; it is not expressed in early B cell precursors or in pre-B cell lines and appears to be down-regulated as the B cell matures to the plasma cell stage. Four copies of a fragment containing the pentadecamer element and the κY core element (16Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 24Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cloned into the pHisi and pLacZi vectors (CLONTECH), between the XbaI and EcoRI sites, andSmaI and EcoRI sites, respectively. The vectors were linearized by XhoI or NcoI digestions and stably integrated into the YM 4271 yeast strain (CLONTECH). The integration was verified by Southern blotting of PCR1-amplified DNA from genomic yeast DNA using either Hisi- or LacZi-specific primers, using one copy of the inserted fragment as a probe (5′-TACTCTCAAACAGCTGTGTAATTTACTTTCC-3′). The EBF binding site yeast strain was constructed using the same protocol with four copies of the EBF binding CCCT element from the SP6 κ promoter (25Sigvardsson M. Åkerblad P. Leanderson T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3788-3796PubMed Google Scholar). The obtained yeast strains did not grow on histidine-deficient plates at a 15 mm concentration of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). BALB/c mouse spleens were minced and set up at a lymphocyte concentration of 1 × 106 lymphocytes/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 5% fetal calf serum and 25 μg/ml LPS. After 72 h, the activated cells were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and total RNA isolated using the acid phenol method. A total of approximately 1 mg of RNA was isolated, and poly(A)+ RNA was obtained by purification on an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Double-stranded cDNA was prepared, inserted into predigested Hybri-ZAP λ arms and packaged as described for Stratagene's two-hybrid system. A total of 3.2 × 106 independent plaques were obtained with an average insert size of 1.1 kilobase pairs. The amplified stock was converted to its phagemid form as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). 20 μg of phagemid was transfected into the yeast strain and spread on SD agar plates minus histidine and minus leucine, containing 15 mm 3-AT as described (CLONTECH). Growing clones were tested in a LacZi assay (CLONTECH), and positive clones were grown, plasmids isolated, transformed into bacteria, and finally retransformed into the screening yeast strain or the EBF control strain. cDNA clones that remained positive through these procedures were sequenced from the 5′ end. A total of six E2A-containing, three E2–2-containing, and one Spi-C-containing clones were identified in the screen. The Hybri-ZAP λ library was spread on 90-mm plates at 22,000 plaque-forming units/plate and overlaid with sodium chloride magnesium to obtain 60 phage pools. These were screened via PCR using two Spi-C-specific primers (5′-GCAAACATTTCAAGACGCC-3′ and 5′-CTGTACGGATTGGTGGAAGC-3′), the products separated by electrophoresis and blotted onto charged nylon membranes, which were probed with a polynucleotide kinase end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-CAGACCTGTATTTGGAAGGA-3′) as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Two positive pools were identified, and these were subsequently screened according to standard procedures using the original yeast Spi-C clone as probe and then excised as plasmids according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The longest of the two clones was completely sequenced on each strand using the Sanger dideoxy method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with a combination of internal primers and restriction fragments cloned into pGEM 3Z (Promega). The original yeast clone was sequenced in parallel, and no differences between the two clones were detected in overlapping sequences. The full-length Spi-C clone was cloned between theEcoRI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), while the partial Spi-C cDNA obtained from the yeast screening was cloned between the EcoRI and XhoI sites in a modified pcDNA3 vector in which an OCT2 ATG region (5′-AATTGCGGGCAGCATGGTTCATTCCAGCGAATT-3′) had been inserted into theEcoRI site. The cDNAs were in vitrotranslated using Promega's coupled transcription/translation reticulocyte system from the T7 promoter. The EMSAs were performed as described (16Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), using between 1 and 0.1 μl of reticulocyte extract. Competitions were performed using 10, 30, 100, and 300 times, or 30, 100, 300, and 1000 times molar excess of competitor; the sequences of the competitors and probes can be found in Ref. 16Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1308-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar. The methylation interference analyses were made as described (24Sigvardsson M. Bemark M. Leanderson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1343-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using protein translated from the yeast clone. After autoradiography of the wet gel for 4 h, the free and bound probes were cut out, eluted in 1× TE with 50 mm NaCl overnight, extracted with phenol, and ethanol-precipitated. The precipitated DNA was treated with piperidine as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and subsequently separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 1× TBE gel that was fixed, dried, and autoradiographed. The full-length or carboxyl-terminal part of Spi-C cDNA were amplified via PCR using Spi-C primers (full-length: 5′-ACGAGATCTATGACTTGTTGTATTGATC-3′ against 5′-ACGGAATTCTCAGCTCTGGTAACTGG-3′, carboxyl part: 5′-ACGA GATCTGAGGCTGTTCTCCAAAGA-3′ against 5′-ACGGAATTCTCAGCTCTGG TAACTGG-3′) and inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after restriction withBglII and EcoRI and verified by sequencing using the pGEX 5′ primer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were expressed and purified on glutathione-Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the carboxyl terminus-containing protein was further purified on a Q Column (Beckman) and was then used to raise a polyclonal sera in rabbits according to standard procedures. For the first round of site selection, an N oligonucleotide (5′-GCCACTGCGAATTCTCT(N)20AATGGGATCCCGTCGCA-3′) was annealed to a [32P]polynucleotide kinase-labeled oligonucleotide, and fill-in was performed using Klenow enzyme. This oligonucleotide was then used in EMSA with the recombinant, full-length glutathione S-transferase-Spi-C protein. A piece of the gel that corresponded to the mobility of the Spi-C-DNA complex was cut out and eluted in 1× TBE overnight. The eluted DNA was amplified for 15 cycles in PCR using 5′ and 3′ primers (5′ primer: 5′-GCCACTGCGAATTCTC-3′, 3′ primer: 5′-TGCGACGGGATCCCAT-3′), end-labeled, and purified by gel electrophoresis. The selection procedure was repeated twice more, and the final PCR products were cut with EcoRI and BamHI, inserted into the pGEM3Z vector (Promega), and sequenced. Northern blotting was performed using standard protocols, and 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was loaded in each lane (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Isolation of cells was done either by cell sorting (FACS Vantage, Beckton Dickinson) or by using magnetic MACS beads (Miltenyi Biotec). RNAs were prepared from tissue using a Pharmacia poly(A) RNA kit (the B cell lines), Qiaex spin columns (Qiagen; ES cells, lymph node and liver), or RNAzol B (Tel-test, Inc.; the rest). The RT reactions were performed using Superscript II (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the primers and probe used were the same as used in the library screen (see above). The amount of cDNA in each reaction was titrated using HPRT primers (27Mårtensson I.L. Melchers F. Winkler T.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Primers used to detect PU.1 expression in cell lines were described before (28Lin H. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1995; 376: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). In some cases different exposures from the same blots are shown, but the HPRT exposure were always matched with the Ets probe exposure. The 4× κY reporter construct was made by inserting an oligonucleotide containing four copies of the κY element and the TATA box from the SP6 κ promoter between the HindIII and XhoI sites of the pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (Promega), and the TATA box only containing was subsequently created by EcoRI digestion and re-ligation to remove the κY elements. To obtain a PU.1 expression vector, anEcoRI/ApaI fragment containing the coding region of PU.1 was inserted into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen). HeLa cells (2.5 × 106 cells/transfection) were transfected in duplicate using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Each transfection contained 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.3 μg of expression plasmid, as indicated. All co-transfections were normalized to contain 0.8 μg of DNA/transfection using the pcDNA3 plasmid. The cells were harvested and the luciferase activity determined after 40 h of incubation, and the mean value ± standard deviation from three experiments is shown. Southern blotting and the isolation of a genomic Spi-C clone was performed according to standard protocols (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The chromosome mapping using FISH was performed by SeeDNA Biotech Inc., Toronto, Canada. Mouse chromosomes were prepared according to the published procedure. Briefly, lymphocytes were isolated from mouse spleen and cultured at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, 3 μg/ml concanavalin A, 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide, and 5 × 10−5m mercaptoethanol. After 44 h, the cultures were treated with 0.18 mg/ml bromodeoxyuridine for an additional 14 h. The synchronized cells were washed and recultured at 37 °C for 4 h in α-minimal essential medium with thymidine (2.5 μg/ml). Chromosome slides were made by conventional method as used for human chromosome preparation (hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air-drying). As a probe, a 12.5-kilobase pair genomic fragment cloned from a I129 genomic library was used after biotinylation using a Life Technologies BioNick labeling kit at 15 °C for 1 h (29Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). FISH detection was performed as described (29Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 30Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h, and after treatment with RNase A the slides were denatured in 70% formamide in 2× SSC for 2 min at 70 °C, followed by dehydration with ethanol. Probes were denatured at 75 °C for 5 min in a hybridization mix consisting of 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and mouse cot I DNA, and prehybridized for 15 min at 37 °C before being loaded on the denatured slides. After overnight hybridization, slides were washed, detected, and amplified as described (29Heng H.H. Squire J. Tsui L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). FISH signals and DAPI banding pattern were recorded separately by photography, and the assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was achieved by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI-banded chromosomes (30Heng H.H. Tsui L.C. Chromosoma. 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows a schematic illustration of the mouse SP6 κ promoter. This immunoglobulin promoter contains several DNA elements that are poor activators of transcription per se but that will stimulate octamer-induced transcription (16Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J.

In this study we focused on the octamer upstream region that contains two transcriptional control elements, the bipartite pentadecamer element and the κY element (16Bemark M. Leanderson T. Eur. J.

In an effort to identify the proteins that interact with these DNA elements, we used the sequence shown in Fig. 1 A as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen of a cDNA library made from LPS-stimulated mouse B cells (Fig. 1 B). We isolated several E-box binding clones, all encoded by the E2A and E2–2 genes (data not shown), and in addition a clone containing a novel DNA sequence that we decided to call Spi-C. Also shown in Fig. 1 B is a confirmation of the specificity of the screening procedure, using a control yeast strain that had an EBF binding site as bait. When using the pentadecamer/κY yeast strain, Spi-C could rescue yeast growth on 3-AT-containing media while an EBF-containing plasmid could not. The opposite was true using the EBF control. Furthermore, in the absence of selection, the cDNA clones also activated the transcription of the LacZ genes as expected; Spi-C was positive only in the yeast strain used for screening, while EBF was positive only in the EBF bait strain. To investigate the binding specificity of the Spi-C gene product, the insert from the original yeast clone was transcribed and translatedin vitro and the protein product analyzed by band-shift using the bait sequence as a probe. As shown in Fig. 1 C, unlabeled probe competed efficiently for binding in this assay while a competitor that contained the SP6 κ promoter octamer and its 3′-flanking region did not. Further analysis of the region used as bait showed that a competitor that contained an intact κY element competed efficiently for binding, while competitors with mutations of the κY element or with a truncated κY element did not. We concluded from these experiments that Spi-C interacted specifically with the κY element in the SP6 κ promoter. A full-length cDNA clone of Spi-C was isolated from a λ cDNA library made from LPS-stimulated B cells using the insert from the yeast clone as a probe. The full-length cDNA encompassed 1267 base pairs (accession no. AF098863), and contained an open reading frame starting with an ATG at position 144 and a stop codon at position 870. This would generate an open reading frame of 242 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 28 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Homology searches using the protein sequence showed that the protein had sequence similarity to the Ets proteins PU.1 and Spi-B in their DNA binding domain, while no significant homology was detected outside of this region. Hence, Spi-C appears to be a novel member of the Ets transcription factor family. Fig. 2 (B and C) shows an analysis of the protein sequence homology in the Ets domain between Spi-C, PU.1, Spi-B, elf-1, and Ets-1. Outside the Ets domain, the amino acid sequence diverged quite extensively compared with the other Ets family proteins. With regard to the Ets domain, that of Spi-C matched those of PU.1 and Spi-B more closely than those of Ets-1 or elf-1, although all amino acids that are universally conserved in Ets proteins (34Pio F. Kodandapani R. Ni C.Z. Shepard W. Klemsz M. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23329-23337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) were also conserved within the Ets domain of Spi-C (Fig. 2 B). The amino acid identity within the Ets domains of Spi-B and PU.1 was 73%, while it was 59% or 63% when compared with Spi-C for PU.1 and Spi-B, respectively (Fig. 2 C). When the α helices within the Ets domain were analyzed separately, the degree of identity between PU.1/Spi-B and Spi-C was most pronounced in helix 3 (79%), while less marked in helix 2 (54–62%) and in helix 1 (31%). This is in contrast to the degree of identity between Spi-B and PU.1 that was very high (77%) also in helix 1 and 2. Since helix 2 and 3 entail the amino acids that contact DNA directly in PU.1 (35Kodandapani R. Pio F. Ni C.Z. Piccialli G. Klemsz M. McKercher S. Maki R.A. Ely K.R. Nature. 1996; 380: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the higher level of identity between Spi-B/PU.1 and Spi-C is not surprising, given that Spi-C binds a bona fide PU.1 binding site (18Schwarzenbach H. Newell J.W. Matthias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Also, all amino acid positions shown by mutagenesis to be critical for PU.1 binding to DNA were conserved between PU.1 and Spi-C (36Bemark M. Liberg D. Leanderson T. Immunogenetics. 1998; 47: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We conclude from these results that Spi-C is more closely related to PU.1 and Spi-B than to other Ets proteins, but more diverged from these two proteins than those to each other. Given the low degree of identity in helix 1 of the Ets domain, Spi-C might be representing a novel subgroup within the Ets protein family. The interaction between Spi-C and the κY element was further characterized and compared with that of PU.1 (18Schwarzenbach H. Newell J.W. Matthias P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 898-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). First, the binding of the two proteins were studied via methylation interference analysis. Methylation of the two central G nucleotides within the Ets motif of the non-coding strand completely inhibited both Spi-C and PU.1 binding, while no specific interference could be detected by methylation of the coding strand (Fig.3 A). Upon longer exposures, detected partial interference by methylation of some of the A residues could also be detected, identically for both proteins (data not shown). To further investigate the relationship between Spi-C and PU.1 DNA binding, we performed band-shift analysis using the κY element as a probe, in vitro translated full-length Spi-C or PU.1 as ligands and various defined PU.1 sites as competitors. The in vitro translated, full-length Spi-C generated two complexes in the band-shift and also two bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). The larger of these bands correlated in size with the predicted value for full-length Spi-C (28 kDa), and we therefore assume that the more abundant, faster migrating complex represents a partial break-down product with an intact DNA binding domain. That the DNA binding domain is not affected by the limited proteolysis is supported by the fact that in vitro translation of the original yeast clone generated only one product (Fig. 2 C). As shown in Fig.3 B, Spi-C κY binding could be competed by PU.1 binding sites from the SV40 enhancer (11Ray D. Bosselut R. Ghysdael J. Mattei M.G. Tavitian A. Moreau-Gachelin F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4297-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), the κ3′ enhancer (17Pongubala J.M. Nagulapalli S. Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Maki R.A. Atchison M.L. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, the amount of competitor needed to compete Spi-C binding was similar to that needed to compete PU.1 binding to the same probe. Finally, we performed a site-selection experiment using recombinant Spi-C to ask the question whether any novel Ets binding motifs could be revealed. As summarized in TableI, 90% of the selected templates contained established PU.1 binding s"

To investigate the mechanism of the regulation, we prepared and characterized a chemically modified TIMP-2, and examined its effects on the activation of progelatinase A. We found that treatment of TIMP-2 with cyanate ion led to loss of inhibitory activity toward matrilysin or gelatinase A. Structural and functional analyses of the modified TIMP-2 showed that carbamylation of the alpha-amino group of the NH2-terminal Cys1 of TIMP-2 led to complete loss of the inhibitory activity. When the reactive-site modified TIMP-2 was added to culture medium of concanavalin A-stimulated HT1080 cells, the conversion of endogenous progelatinase A to the intermediate form was partially inhibited, whereas that of the intermediate form to the mature one was strongly inhibited. The reactive site-modified TIMP-2 also prevented an accumulation of active gelatinase A on the cell surface. We speculate that occupation of the hemopexin-like domain of gelatinase A by the reactive site-modified TIMP-2 makes it unable for gelatinase A to be retained on the cell surface, thus preventing the autocatalytic conversion of the intermediate form of gelatinase A to its mature form."

The responsible proteases, variously called secretases, sheddases, or convertases, cleave the membrane-bound form at sites near the plasma membrane on the extracellular side of the single membrane-spanning domain. The entire extracellular domain, often physiologically active, is released into the medium or the circulation. This process of cleavage and secretion appears to be an important and widely used cellular post-translational regulatory process because a variety of structurally and functionally unrelated cell-surface proteins undergo this process. They include tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α),1 involved in inflammatory responses, several cytokine receptors, β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) implicated in Alzheimer's disease, a number of growth factors and their receptors, cell adhesion molecules, and the vasoregulatory enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (1Ehlers M.R.

Since a number of these proteins are involved in disease processes such as inflammation, neurodegeneration, hypertension, apoptosis, and oncogenesis, the secretases could also provide novel therapeutic targets. Despite the biological importance of this process, little is known about the identity of the responsible proteases. We have been studying the characteristics of one such protease, ACE-secretase, the enzyme involved in cleavage and secretion of ACE (3Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

Although ACE is primarily a cell-associated protein, under normal physiological conditions soluble ACE is found in serum and other body fluids (8Hooper N.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 641-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cleavage and secretion of ACE is particularly significant because tissue-bound ACE and soluble ACE in circulation may have different physiological roles. ACE has two structurally related isozymes: testicular ACE (ACET) and pulmonary ACE (ACEP), involved in male fertility and blood pressure regulation, respectively (9Krege J.H. John S.W.

We and others have shown that both ectoproteins, ACET and ACEP, undergo specific cleavage and secretion (3Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol.

The nature of the ACE-secretase activity has been studied in vitro using cell lines that do not express ACE, as well as primary cultures of cells that generate ACE in vivo. The results obtained from these studies are corroborated by observations made with human and animal tissue expressing natural ACE (6Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar, 13Beldent V. Michaud A. Wei L. Chauvet M.-T. Corvol P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26428-26434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ACE89, a mouse epithelial cell line permanently transfected with a rabbit ACET expression vector, synthesizes, glycosylates, and secretes enzymatically active soluble ACET (3Sen I. Samanta H. Livingston III, W. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The secretion process is slow, and ACET accumulates on the cell surface. However, secretion can be enhanced by treatment of cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C, indicating the existence of cellular mechanisms that regulate the conversion of cell-bound ACET to its soluble form. The secreted protein has a molecular mass lower by 8 kDa than the corresponding cellular form, suggesting that a proteolytic cleavage is involved. The exact site of cleavage in this system has been determined. The cleavage occurs in the ectodomain near the transmembrane domain between Arg663 and Ser664, generating the short form, soluble ACET, which lacks the membrane-anchoring C-terminal tail of the cell-associated ACET (4Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have developed a cell-free in vitro assay system to quantitate and characterize ACE-secretase, utilizing membranes prepared from ACE89 cells and rabbit lung. The in vitrosecretase activity was resistant to high salt extraction and to inhibitors of serine, chymotrypsin, trypsin, cysteine, aspartate, and elastase type proteases, but it is susceptible to Compound 3, a hydroxamic acid-based inhibitor of certain metalloproteases (5Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results indicate that ACE-secretase is an integral membrane metalloprotease. We extended the observation made with ACETin a transfected system to explain the mechanism of ACEPsecretion in vivo. A similar pattern of inhibition of ACEP production was observed in natural and transfected vascular endothelial cells and freshly isolated kidney epithelial cells, the two major sources of ACEP in the body. These observations, together with analysis of ACEP proteins present in rabbit serum, lung, and kidney, established that ACEP secreted in vivo is also caused by the cleavage removal of the C-terminal region of the cell-associated protein (6Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar). In this article, we report the use of the same in vitro assay to characterize, for the first time, detergent-soluble ACE-secretase from both ACE89 cells and rabbit lung membranes. The secretases studied so far share certain general properties, such as stimulation by PMA and sensitivity to hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitors. These common properties suggest that the shedding phenomena may be mediated by the same cellular components since mutant cell lines have been isolated that are defective in hydroxamic acid inhibitor-susceptible, PMA-stimulated cleavage and secretion of many proteins, including TGF-α, TNF-α,L-selectin, interleukin-6 receptor α-subunit, and β-APP (14Arribas J.

These observations led to the suggestion that a single secretase or a small number of similar secretases rather than multiple independent secretases are involved in the shedding process. The most well characterized secretase is TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE), the one that cleaves proTNF-α. TACE has recently been purified and cloned (15Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J.

TACE-deficient cell populations derived from these mutant mice are grossly deficient in shedding of several other ectoproteins in addition to TNF-α.

These results reinforce the suggestion that the shedding process, which involves various structurally and functionally diverse proteins, is probably mediated by the same or a similar type of proteases. In this report, we show that, unlike the release of several other ectoproteins mentioned above, the cleavage and secretion of either isozyme of ACE does not require TACE. Also, the process of cleavage and secretion of ACE in vivo in mice is not affected by the absence of TACE. These results indicate that ACE-secretase is a unique enzyme, different from TACE. Here, for the first time, we also report solubilization of ACE-secretase and characterization of some of the unusual properties of the solubilized enzyme.

Chem. 1991; 266: 21985-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), labeled overnight with [35S]methionine (100 μCi/150-mm plate) were scraped and suspended in 0.02 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 m sucrose, protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim, prepared according to manufacturer's instructions), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (1 μm), and phosphoramidon (50 μm). The cell suspension was homogenized in a Polytron and centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 36,000 ×g for 40 min. The sedimented membranes were washed and used as the membrane preparation, as described previously (5Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For solubilization, the membrane pellet was suspended in 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 m NaCl, the protease inhibitors and 0.1% Triton X-100 (0.25 ml/150-mm plate). The suspension was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged at 36,000 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was used as the source of solubilized ACE-secretase. Rabbit lung membranes were prepared as described previously (5Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the ACE-secretase activity was solubilized from these membranes by detergent extraction, as described above for ACE89 cell membranes. In the deglycosylation-PAGE assay (Fig. 3 A), detergent extracts of ACE89 cell membranes (0.25 ml) were incubated with or without 300 μl of lisinopril-Sepharose (6Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar) or concanavalin A (ConA)-agarose (Sigma, 200 μl) in a final volume of 1.5 ml for 1 h at 37 °C. For incubations using lisinopril-Sepharose, 0.02 m HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.3 m NaCl, and 100 μm ZnCl2were included, whereas for incubations using ConA-agarose, 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m NaCl were included. Protease inhibitors were present in all incubations. The reaction was stopped by boiling with SDS (1%) for 3 min; the incubation mixture was then centrifuged, and ACE-related proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant and deglycosylated usingN-glycosidase F, neuraminidase, and O-glycosidase before being analyzed by PAGE (5Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). ACE-secretase activity in the ACE89 cell membranes was assayed, as described previously (5Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For the detergent-extraction assay (Table IV), membranes or Triton X-100 extract of the membranes prepared from rabbit lung were incubated with or without lisinopril-Sepharose, as described above, at 4 °C or 37 °C for 1 h. Uncleaved and cleaved ACEP proteins were physically separated by the temperature-induced phase-separation method utilizing Triton X-114, as described previously (5Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and ACEP enzyme activity was measured in both the detergent and the aqueous phase. In the incubations containing lisinopril-Sepharose, phase separation was performed after ACE proteins were eluted from the lisinopril-Sepharose by borate buffer (6Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar). As determined previously (5Ramchandran R. Sen I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12645-12652Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), cleaved ACE partitions to the aqueous phase almost exclusively (more than 98%), whereas the majority (more than 66%) of the uncleaved ACE is present in the detergent phase. A considerable amount (34%) of uncleaved ACE also partitions to the aqueous phase. Thus, the corrected value for cleaved ACEP was calculated by subtracting this latter value from the total ACEP activity determined in the aqueous phase.Table IVACE-secretase activity in detergent extract of rabbit lung membranesMembrane++−−−−Detergent extract−−++++Lisinopril-Sepharose−−−−++4 °C37 °C4 °C37 °C4 °C37 °CCleaved ACEgenerated (%)8 ± 0.355 ± 19 ± 117 ± 437 ± 380 ± 3Membrane prepared from rabbit lung or detergent extract of the membranes, with and without lisinopril-Sepharose, were incubated at 4 °C or 37 °C for 1 h.

To determine if TACE is required for the cleavage and secretion of ACE, we investigated the ability of TACE-deficient fibroblasts to secrete ACE. These mutant cells were generated by immortalizing fibroblasts derived from TACE-deficient mice and comparing them with similarly immortalized cells from wild-type mice. As expected, the mutant cells were defective in secretion of TNF-α following transfection of DNA encoding proTNF-α (19Merlos-Suarez A. Fernandez-Larrea J. Reddy P. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24955-24962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ACE is not naturally expressed in fibroblasts (data not shown); thus, to determine the ability of these mutant cells to secrete ACE, we transiently transfected the TACE-deficient and the wild-type fibroblasts with ACET cDNA. The synthesis and secretion of transfected ACET were studied by Western blot analysis using an anti-ACE antibody. The cell extracts (Fig.1 A, lane 1) and culture media (lane 2) of mutant (right panel) and wild-type (left panel) cell populations exhibited comparable amounts of ACET, indicating that the mutant cells are not deficient in expressing ACET and that both cell types secreted ACET in a comparable fashion as well. The secreted ACET exhibited a slightly greater electrophoretic mobility than the corresponding cell-associated form (compare lanes 1 and 2 in both panels). Our previous results suggested that this was due to the cleavage removal of the membrane-anchoring C-terminal segment of ACE during the secretion process. We tested this directly by using an anti-peptide antibody that recognizes an epitope near the C terminus of ACE. Although the anti-ACE antibody recognized both the cell-bound and secreted ACET, the anti-peptide antibody recognized the cell-bound form but not the secreted form of ACET (lanes 3 and4, respectively, in both panels), indicating that the secreted ACE is missing the C-terminal fragment. These results demonstrate that mutant cells that cannot efficiently secrete TNF-α because of the absence of TACE are able to cleave and secrete ACET as efficiently as the wild-type cells. We have shown previously that ACE-secretase activity present in ACE89 cells, as well as in the primary cultures of rabbit renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, is resistant to inhibitors of various known classes of proteases. None of the inhibitors of trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, cysteine, serine, aspartate, and certain metalloprotease inhibitors had any effect on cleavage and secretion of ACET by ACE89 cells (4Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or ACEP by renal epithelial cells (6Ramchandran R. Kasturi S. Douglas J.G. Sen I. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: H744-H751PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor, Compound 3, significantly inhibited secretion of both ACET and ACEP. In addition, cleavage and secretion of both isozymes of ACE was enhanced by treatment of cells with PMA. Thus, to further characterize the properties of ACE-secretase present in TACE-deficient cells, the effects of Compound 3 and PMA on ACE-secretase activity in TACE-deficient cells were studied. The wild-type and the mutant cells were transfected with ACET cDNA, pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, and chased in the absence (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 4) or in the presence of Compound 3 (lanes 5 and6) or PMA (lanes 7 and 8), added to the culture media. PMA increased secretion moderately, but significantly (p < 0.05), whereas Compound 3 inhibited secretion almost completely (Fig. 1 B and TableI). Thus, the ACE-secretase present in TACE-deficient cells exhibited biochemical characteristics similar to those of wild-type cells. It should be noted that, unlike in ACE89 cells (4Ramchandran R. Sen G.C. Misono K. Sen I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2125-2130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enhancement of secretion by PMA in fibroblasts is less pronounced.

This chimera was cleaved extremely efficiently, with a rate of secretion much higher than the natural substrate, ACET. The cleavage occurred in the membrane-proximal CD4 sequences. We trans"

Recombinant wild-type or mutant gp91phox was expressed in a human myeloid leukemia cell line in which the endogenous gp91phox gene was disrupted by gene targeting. NADPH oxidase activity was measured in a cytochrome c reduction assay following granulocytic differentiation of cells that expressed recombinant gp91phox. Expression of a gp91phox mutant in which amino acids 89–97 were replaced with nine alternate amino acids abolished NADPH oxidase activity. Expression of gp91phoxmutants R89T, D95A, D95R, R96A, R96E, or K102T did not significantly affect NADPH oxidase activity. However, mutations of individual or paired arginine residues at positions 91 and 92 had substantial effects on superoxide generation. The R91E/R92E mutation completely abolished both NADPH oxidase activity and membrane-translocation of the cytosolic oxidase proteins p47phox, p67phox, Rac1, and Rac2. The phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced rate of superoxide production was reduced by ∼75% in cells expressing R91T/R92A, R91E, or R92E gp91phox along with an increased lag time to the maximal rates of superoxide production relative to cells expressing wild-type gp91phox. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Arg91 and Arg92 of gp91phox are essential for flavocytochrome b 558 function in granulocytes and suggest that these residues participate in the interaction of gp91phox with the cytosolic oxidase proteins.

The redox site of the oxidase is flavocytochromeb 558, which is a membrane-associated heterodimer composed of gp91phox and p22phox. NADPH oxidase activity also requires the cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox, and either of the small G-proteins Rac1 or Rac2 (reviewed in Refs. 1Bokoch G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 212Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar and 2DeLeo F. Quinn M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The p47phox and p67phoxsubunits are present as a complex in the cytosol of resting neutrophils, along with p40phox, the latter of which is not required for superoxide formation in cell-free NADPH oxidase assays but may stabilize p67phox in intact cells (3Wientjes F. Hsuan J. Totty N. Segal A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 557Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). While the precise function of each of the oxidase subunits is incompletely defined, it is well documented that gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox are absolutely required for superoxide production in intact cells, since a deficiency in any one of these proteins results in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD),1 a rare genetic disorder characterized by severe recurrent bacterial and fungal infections (see Ref. 4Dinauer M. Hematology of Infancy and Childhood. 5th Ed. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1998: 889-967Google Scholar for review). The oxidase is dormant in resting phagocytes until cellular activation by inflammatory stimuli signals the assembly of flavocytochromeb 558, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac into the active respiratory burst enzyme. The mechanism of activation and assembly of the oxidase is currently under investigation. According to the current paradigm (reviewed in Ref. 2DeLeo F. Quinn M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 677Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), flavocytochromeb 558 serves as a docking site for p47phox and p67phox, which translocate to the plasma membrane as a unit after one or both of these cytosolic proteins become phosphorylated. The p47phox subunit appears to play an important role in mediating the initial phases of oxidase assembly. In cell-free assays of superoxide production, participation of p47phox was shown to precede that of p67phox in formation of the active NADPH oxidase (5Kleinberg M. Malech H. Rotrosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15577-15583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p67phoxtranslocation does not occur in p47phox-deficient CGD, whereas, in the genetic absence of p67phox, translocation of p47phox is not impaired (6Heyworth P. Curnutte J. Nauseef W. Volpp B. Pearson D. Rosen H. Clark R. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 321Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Current evidence suggests that Rac translocates to the membrane concurrently (7Quinn M. Evans T. Loetterle L. Jesaitis A. Bokoch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20983-20987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with, but as a separate unit from, p47phox and p67phox (8Dorseuil O. Quinn M.T. Bokoch G.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1995; 58: 108Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, it is not clear if translocation of p67phox is a prerequisite for translocation of Rac. While Rac has been shown to interact directly with p67phox (9Diekmann D. Abo A. Johnston C. Segal A. Hall A. Science. 1994; 265: 531Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 10Prigmore E. Ahmed S.

Bohl B. Bokoch G. Curnutte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Dusi S. Donini M. Rossi F. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 409Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) or in cell-free reactions using p47phox- or p67phox-deficient cytosol (13Heyworth P. Bohl B. Bokoch G. Curnutte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple sites within both gp91phox and p22phox have been proposed as binding sites for p47phox including a hydrophilic, polybasic domain within gp91phox between residues 86 and 102. A portion of this domain was identified as a site of interaction with p47phox by DeLeo and colleagues using random sequence peptide phage display analysis (15DeLeo F. Yu L. Burritt J. Loetterle L. Bond C. Jesaitis A. Quinn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This domain is likely to reside at the intracytoplasmic face of the membrane based on current models of the topologic organization of gp91phox (16Wallach T. Segal A. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 583Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Peptides derived from this sequence are potent inhibitors of superoxide formation (15DeLeo F. Yu L. Burritt J. Loetterle L. Bond C. Jesaitis A. Quinn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Park M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Nunoi H. Kanegasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 531Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and translocation of the cytosolic subunits p47phox and p67phox (17Park M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Nunoi H. Kanegasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 531Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in cell-free assays. In the present study, we used site-directed mutagenesis of gp91phox amino acids 86–102 to identify key residues within this hydrophilic domain that are involved in NADPH oxidase assembly and function. Mutant derivatives of gp91phox were expressed in a myelomonocytic cell line that lacks endogenous gp91phoxexpression due to gene targeting. We found that replacement of a pair of arginine residues at positions 91 and 92 with two glutamic acid residues abolished superoxide production and inhibited the stable translocation of the cytosolic oxidase proteins p47phox, p67phox, Rac1, and Rac2 to the membranes of activated granulocytes. Replacement of both arginine residues with neutral rather than acidic amino acids did not abolish NADPH oxidase activity but resulted in an increased lag time to maximal rates of enzyme activity and an overall decrease in superoxide formation. We conclude that Arg91 and Arg92 of gp91phox participate in a critical step in assembly of the active oxidase complex. The following reagents were purchased from Sigma:N,N-dimethylformamide, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, Me2SO, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), zymosan, cytochrome c, superoxide dismutase, FAD, and NADPH. Complete, EDTA-free, protease inhibitor tablets were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Wild-type PLB-985 cells, a human myeloid leukemia cell line, and X-CGD PLB-985 cells, a derivative line in which the X-linked gp91phox gene has been disrupted by gene targeting, were maintained as described (18Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For granulocytic differentiation, cells at a starting density of 1 × 105 cells/ml were exposed to 0.5%N,N-dimethylformamide for 6 days (18Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Mutations of individual or multiple amino acids in the hydrophilic, polybasic domain of gp91phox between residues 86 and 102 were introduced into a full-length wild-type gp91phox cDNA cloned into theNotI site of the multiple cloning site of pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) using the Quik-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or the Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Wild-type or mutant gp91phox cDNAs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing and were subcloned into the pEF-PGKpac mammalian expression vector (19Zhen L. Yu L. Dinauer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6575-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mutant gp91phoxexpression constructs were resequenced to confirm the mutations, and all constructs were linearized with KpnI prior to electroporation into X-CGD PLB-985 cells. All preparations and manipulations of plasmids were performed using standard protocols (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Following electroporation, clones were selected by limiting dilution in 2 μg/ml puromycin and screened for gp91phox expression by immunoblot. To minimize any clone-to-clone variation in recombinant gp91phox expression or NADPH oxidase activity, 4–6 independent clones determined to express transgenic gp91phox were pooled and used for subsequent analysis. Cultured granulocyte-differentiated PLB-985 and derivative cell lines were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. After diisopropyl fluorophosphate treatment for 10 min on ice, whole cell extracts were made as described previously (21Yu L. Zhen L. Dinauer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27288-27294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant wild-type and mutant gp91phox and endogenous p22phox proteins were analyzed by immunoblot using monoclonal antibodies 49 and 449, respectively (22Verhoeven A. Bolscher B. Meerhof L. van Zwieten R. Keijer J. Weening R. Roos D. Blood. 1989; 73: 1686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by A. Verhoeven and D. Roos, Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Blood Transfusion Service) as described previously (18Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Scanning densitometry was employed to measure the relative intensity of the gp91phox signal using a Silver Scan II scanner and Image 1.60 software (W. Rasband, National Institutes of Health). The relative levels of gp91phox expression were confirmed using two polyclonal gp91phox antibodies (23Dinauer M. Parkos C. Jesaitis A. Orkin S. Nature. 1987; 327: 717Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 24Pollock J. Williams D. Gifford M. Li L. Du X. Fisherman J. Orkin S. Doerschuk C. Dinauer M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 202Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). A continuous cytochrome c reduction assay was used to quantitate the superoxide dismutase-inhibitable superoxide formation by granulocyte-differentiated PLB-985 cells and derivative cell lines (18Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The assay was performed at 37 °C using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) and associated SOFTMAX version 2.02 software on whole cells after stimulation with PMA (100 ng/ml) or opsonized zymosan (6 mg/ml) freshly prepared as described (25Tosi M. Hamendani A. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1992; 97: 566Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Superoxide production was quantitated using an extinction coefficient of 21.1 mm−1 cm−1 for cytochromec. Data were analyzed using SOFTMAX to determineV max over a 3-min interval and the time toV max, measured as the elapsed time from the start of the assay until the maximum reaction rate was obtained. Statistical analysis was performed using InStat 2.0 software. NADPH oxidase activity in selected PLB-985 derived cell lines was also analyzed in a cell-free assay. For fractionation of membrane-associated and cytosolic proteins, cells were harvested and diisopropyl fluorophosphate-treated as described above, resuspended to 1 × 108 cells/ml in relaxation buffer (19Zhen L. Yu L. Dinauer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6575-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and sonicated at 20% power (Sonics and Materials, Inc.) for 3 × 6 s at 4 °C. The membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared by sequential centrifugation (26Fujita I. Takeshige K. Minakami S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 931: 41Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and were added to a standard reaction mixture containing 100 μm cytochrome c, 10 μm FAD, 100 μm SDS in relaxation buffer with or without superoxide dismutase. After a 3-min incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was initiated with 200 μm NADPH and was monitored at 550 nm using a Thermomax microplate reader. PLB-985 and derivative cell lines were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended at 1 × 108 cells/ml in relaxation buffer. The NADPH oxidase was activated by stimulating the cells with 1 μg/ml PMA in Me2SO or with Me2SO alone for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then placed on ice and, following the addition of 12 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were adjusted to 1 × 108 cells/ml in relaxation buffer and disrupted by sonication for 3 × 6 s at 20% power (Sonics and Materials) at 4 °C. Disrupted cells were centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants in a volume of 1 ml were then layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient (1.5 ml of 20% over 1 ml of 38%) and centrifuged at 204,000 × g for 30 min. After centrifugation, the top 600 μl was collected as cytosol, and a distinct band at the gradient interface was collected as the membrane fraction. The membrane fractions were mixed with 3.5 ml of cold relaxation buffer and centrifuged at 368,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of relaxation buffer with protease inhibitors. The cytosol and membrane fractions were stored at −80 °C until SDS-PAGE analysis. For analysis of translocation of cytosolic proteins, the membrane fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted sequentially with polyclonal anti-p47phox, polyclonal anti-p67phox (27Green S.

Integrated densitometry was employed to measure the relative intensity of the protein signal using an Eagle Eye II Still Video System and associated software (Stratagene). Statistical analysis was performed using InStat 2.0 software. A hydrophilic domain of gp91phox encompassed by amino acids 86–102 has been implicated as a contact point for p47phox in the assembly of the active NADPH oxidase complex (15DeLeo F. Yu L. Burritt J. Loetterle L. Bond C. Jesaitis A. Quinn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Park M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Nunoi H. Kanegasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 531Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to examine the requirements for an intact 86–102 domain in superoxide production and to identify specific residues within this domain that were essential for normal gp91phox function. We used site-directed mutagenesis to generate a set of gp91phox mutants in which multiple or individual amino acid residues were replaced with alternate residues (Fig. 1). We postulated that charged amino acids within the 86–102 sequence, which contains five basic residues and one acidic residue, might mediate electrostatic interactions with p47phox and/or other cytosolic oxidase subunits. Hence, charged amino acid residues were replaced with neutral or oppositely charged residues, thereby altering the local electrostatic charge within this hydrophilic domain. WT or mutant cDNAs were cloned into a mammalian expression vector and transfected into X-CGD PLB-985 cells, a derivative of the myelocytic cell line PLB-985 in which the coding sequence of the gp91phoxgene was disrupted by gene targeting (18Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and which, therefore, lack endogenous gp91phox expression and NADPH oxidase activity. We assessed the expression of recombinant wild-type or mutant gp91phox proteins by immunoblotting whole cell extracts from PLB-985-derived granulocytes with a monoclonal antibody specific for an undefined epitope of gp91phox (Fig.2). The level of expression of recombinant mutant gp91phox proteins was calculated relative to that seen for recombinant WT gp91phox in X-CGD PLB-985 cells (Fig. 2). Similar relative levels of expression were seen when blots were probed with two different polyclonal anti-gp91phoxantibodies (data not shown). The gp91phox mutant in which amino acids 89–97 were replaced with nine alternate residues was expressed at only one-twentieth the level of recombinant WT gp91phox(Fig. 2). All of the mutant gp91phox polypeptides harboring single or double point mutations were expressed between 10 and 95% of recombinant WT gp91phox levels (Fig. 2). The expression of p22phox in the transfected X-CGD cell lines was rescued in proportion to the level of expression of the recombinant mutant gp91phox (data not shown). We next examined the effect of these gp91phox mutations on PMA-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity in intact PLB-985-derived granulocytes. Superoxide production was completely absent in cells expressing mutant gp91phox in which residues 89–97 had been replaced with nine alternate residues (Fig.3 A). While this mutant was only poorly expressed, previous studies have shown that expression of even small amounts of recombinant wild-type gp91phox can reconstitute considerable oxidase activity in X-CGD neutrophils (18Zhen L. King A. Xiao Y. Chanock S. Orkin S. Dinauer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9832Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar,29Kume A. Dinauer M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Ding C. Kume A. Bjorgvinsdottir H. Hawley R. Pech N. Dinauer M. Blood. 1996; 88: 1834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Bjorgvinsdottir H. Ding C. Pech N. Gifford M. Li L. Dinauer M. Blood. 1997; 89: 41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single or double point mutations in the gp91phox 86–102 domain also resulted in altered NADPH oxidase activity, with the most dramatic effects observed with mutations at Arg91 and Arg92. PMA-stimulated superoxide production was completely abolished in cells expressing recombinant gp91phox in which both Arg91 and Arg92 were replaced with acidic residues (R91E/R92E). When these same arginine residues were both substituted with neutral amino acid residues (R91T/R92A), oxidase activity was markedly decreased, although not abolished (Figs.3 A and 4 A). In addition, cells expressing the gp91phox mutant R91T/R92A displayed a more than 3-fold increase in the lag period between PMA stimulation and the onset of maximal rates of superoxide production (Figs. 3 B and 4 A). In earlier studies, we generated transgenic X-CGD PLB-985 cells lines expressing low levels of recombinant wild-type gp91phox that were associated with decreased rates of superoxide production but without an increased lag time (29Kume A. Dinauer M. Blood. 1994; 84: 3311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2K. J. Biberstine-Kinkade, L. Yu, and M. C. Dinauer, unpublished data. suggesting that delayed onset of V max is independent of low oxidase activity. Replacement of individual arginine residues at position 91 or 92 with glutamic acid (R91E or R92E) also resulted in decreased and delayed PMA-stimulated oxidase activity. However, alanine substitution of either Arg91 or Arg92 with alanine residues (R91A or R92A) resulted in increased oxidase activity, although only that of the R91A mutant reached statistical significance (Fig. 3, A and B). Superoxide production was not significantly affected by neutral substitutions at basic residues 89, 96, or 102 (R89T, R96A, or K102T) or at aspartic acid 95 (D95A); a charge reversal at position Asp95 by substitution with arginine (D95R) or at position Arg96 by substitution with glutamic acid (R96E) also had no statistically significant effect on oxidase activity (Fig. 3 A). Superoxide production in selected cell lines was also measured following stimulation with opsonized zymosan. The overall rate of superoxide production was significantly reduced in cells expressing the gp91phox mutants R91E, R92E, or R91T/R92A (Figs. 4 Band 5 A). However, unlike the PMA-induced respiratory burst, the lag time to maximum rates of superoxide production after opsonized zymosan activation was not significantly increased in these mutants (Figs. 4 B and5 B). The NADPH oxidase was still completely nonfunctional in cells expressing R91E/R92E gp91phox upon stimulation with opsonized zymosan (Figs. 4 B and 5 A). We also examined whether R91T/R92A gp91phox or R91E/R92E gp91phox could support superoxide production in a cell-free assay. No superoxide dismutase-inhibitable superoxide production was detected utilizing membranes from cells expressing R91E/R92E gp91phox (Fig. 4 C). However, NADPH oxidase activity using membranes from cells expressing R91T/R92A gp91phox was similar to that seen with membranes containing WT gp91phox(Fig. 4 C), without any delay in superoxide production. Finally, we investigated whether the R91E/R92E mutation in gp91phox, which abolished NADPH oxidase activity, affected the PMA-induced translocation of the cytosolic oxidase proteins p47phox, p67phox, and Rac to the cell membrane. Membranes from X-CGD PLB-985 granulocytes expressing recombinant WT gp91phox or R91E/R92E gp91phox as well as the parental X-CGD PLB-985 cell line were extracted following PMA stimulation; separated by SDS-PAGE; and analyzed by sequential immunoblotting with anti-p47phox, anti-p67phox, anti-Rac1, and anti-Rac2, (Fig. 6 A). To adjust for any unequal loading of lanes, the amounts of p47phox, p67phox, Rac1, and Rac2 were normalized against the level of the membrane-associated small G protein Rap1a. In agreement with previous studies using normal and X-CGD neutrophils (13Heyworth P. Bohl B. Bokoch G. Curnutte J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PMA activation of PLB-985 granulocytes expressing recombinant WT gp91phox resulted in membrane translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and Rac2, whereas translocation failed to occur or was significantly reduced in X-CGD PLB-985 granulocytes (Fig. 6,A and B). PLB-985 granulocytes had readily detectable levels of Rac1, which upon PMA-induced activation, was also detected in the membrane fraction of cells expressing wild-type gp91phox (Fig. 6). Similar to Rac2, Rac1 translocation was markedly decreased in X-CGD PLB-985 cells (Fig. 6). PLB-985 granulocytes expressing the mutant R91E/R92E gp91phox resembled X-CGD cells in that PMA-induced translocation of p47phox, p67phox, and both Rac1 and Rac2 was absent (Figs. 6,A and B). The phagocyte NADPH oxidase is a multicomponent enzyme assembled from membrane-associated and cytosolic components upon cellular activation by inflammatory stimuli. The objective of this study was to examine the role of a hydrophilic domain encompassing residues 86–102 of gp91phox in oxidase assembly and function. This region was previously identified by random sequence peptide phage display library analysis as a potential site of interaction with p47phox (15DeLeo F. Yu L. Burritt J. Loetterle L. Bond C. Jesaitis A. Quinn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, synthetic peptides derived from residues 86–102 have been shown to inhibit superoxide production in the cell-free superoxide assay (15DeLeo F. Yu L. Burritt J. Loetterle L. Bond C. Jesaitis A. Quinn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 17Park M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Nunoi H. Kanegasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 531Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and in electropermeabilized neutrophils (32DeLeo F. Jutila M. Quinn M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 198: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and can block the translocation of p47phoxand p67phox to flavocytochrome b 558 in a cell-free system (17Park M. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Nunoi H. Kanegasaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 531Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis to probe the role of specific charged amino acid residues within this region of gp91phox, hypothesizing that electrostatic interactions between charged residues in gp91phox and p47phox may be important for assembly of the active oxidase complex. We focused our initial analysis on the functional effect of these mutations in intact granulocytic cells since the protein-protein interactions required for oxidase assembly in intact cells appear to differ from those utilized in the cell-free oxidase assay.

A recombinant form of AT, with similarly low levels of oxidation as purified, was treated with hydrogen peroxide in order to study the effect of oxidation, specifically methionine oxidation, on the biochemical properties of this protein. AT contains two adjacent methionine residues near the reactive site loop cleaved by thrombin (Met314 and Met315) and two exposed methionines that border on the heparin binding region of AT (Met17 and Met20). In forced oxidations with hydrogen peroxide, the methionines at 314 and 315 were found to be the most susceptible to oxidation, but their oxidation did not affect either thrombin-inhibitory activity or heparin binding. Methionines at positions 17 and 20 were significantly oxidized only at higher concentrations of peroxide, at which point heparin affinity was decreased. However at saturating heparin concentrations, activity was only marginally decreased for these highly oxidized samples of AT. Structural studies indicate that highly oxidized AT is less able to undergo the complete conformational change induced by heparin, most probably due to oxidation of Met17. Since this does not occur in less oxidized, and presumably more physiologically relevant, forms of AT such as those found in plasma preparations, oxidation does not appear to be a means of controlling AT activity.

Pizzo S.V. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1988; 43: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Such oxidation can occur in vivo in response to oxidants released by neutrophils (e.g.superoxide, hydroxyl radical) or in vitro when proteins are exposed to oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), periodate, dimethyl sulfoxide, chloramine-T, N-chlorosuccinamide (2Brot N. Weissbach H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 223: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 3Vogt W. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), ort-butyl hydroperoxide (4Keck R.G. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In the majority of cases studied, oxidation of methionine residues has been shown to cause a decrease in the biological activity of the protein. Early studies demonstrated a loss of activity in chymotrypsin upon oxidation of a methionine three residues from the active-site serine (5Weiner H. Batt C.W. Koshland Jr., D. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2687-2693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that oxidation of human growth hormone had no effect on binding to lactogenic receptors, whereas oxidation of the closely related human chorionic somatomammotropin on nonhomologous methionines caused a loss of binding to these receptors (6Teh L.C. Murphy L.J. Huq N.L. Surus A.S. Friesen H.G. Lazarus L. Chapman G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6472-6477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methionine oxidation may also lead to an increase in biological activity, as in the case of the C5 component of complement (7Vogt W. Hesse D. Immunobiology. 1992; 184: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), or to no apparent change in structure or activity, such as with α2-plasmin inhibitor (8Shieh B.H. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6055-6059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most thoroughly studied examples of methionine oxidation and its effect on activity involves the α1-protease inhibitor (α1-PI).1 This protein can be oxidized on two of its eight methionine residues, and oxidation of one of these residues (Met358) causes an almost complete loss of inhibitory activity of α1-PI toward its primary biological target, elastase (9Johnson D. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4022-4026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As in the case of chymotrypsin, the relevant methionine in α1-PI is proximal to the active site for binding of the target protease, in this case the P1 residue within the reactive loop of the protease cleavage site. Oxidation of this methionine in vivo has been suggested to contribute to the development of emphysema in cigarette smokers through a change in the equilibrium between lung elastase and its inhibitor, ultimately resulting in increased elastase activity (10Janoff A. Carp H. Laurent P. Raju L. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1983; 127: S31-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,11Ogushi F. Hubbard R.C. Vogelmeier C. Fells G.A. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1060-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Such an imbalance is known to promote emphysema in cases of inherited α1-PI deficiency, particularly among those who smoke (12Gadek J.E. Fells G.A. Zimmerman R.L. Rennard S.I. Crystal R.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 889-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 13Perlmutter D.H. Ann. Med. 1996; 28: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that methionine oxidation may actually be a general means of physiological inactivation of plasma protease inhibitors (1Swaim M.W. Pizzo S.V. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1988; 43: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we have examined the susceptibility to oxidation of a plasma protease inhibitor closely related to α1-PI, namely antithrombin (AT). Like α1-PI and other serpins, AT has a reactive loop structure that binds to and then is cleaved by the target protease (for a review, see Ref. 14Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). In the case of AT, however, the reactive loop is partially inserted into the protein, based on x-ray crystal structure (15Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 16Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J. Grootenhuis P.D. Hol W.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the binding of heparin causes a conformational change that results in activation of AT as an inhibitor (17van Boeckel C.A. Grootenhuis P.D. Visser A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 423-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This conformational shift also changes the environment of tryptophan residues within AT, causing an increase in fluorescence (18Meagher J.L. Beechem J.M. Olson S.T. Gettins P.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23283-23289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There has been one report of oxidative inactivation of AT (20Stief T.W. Aab A. Heimburger N. Thromb. Res. 1988; 49: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); however, the sites(s) and extent of oxidation were not characterized in this study. AT contains 12 methionines, five of which are relatively exposed on the surface of the protein. Within the three-dimensional structure, two of these methionine residues (Met314 and Met315) are positioned adjacent to the reactive loop of AT, which is cleaved by thrombin between Arg393 and Ser394. Another two of the exposed methionines (Met17 and Met20) border on the heparin binding site of AT. The three-dimensional structure of AT is quite similar to α1-PI, which, as discussed above, is inactivated by oxidation of a methionine within its reactive loop. If, as suggested by Swaim and Pizzo (1Swaim M.W. Pizzo S.V. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1988; 43: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), methionine oxidation serves as a general means of plasma protease inhibitor inactivation, it might be expected that oxidation of Met314 and/or Met315 in AT could be a means of physiologically down-regulating its activity. We report here on the relative sensitivity of these methionine residues to oxidation and the resulting effects on AT in terms of both thrombin-inhibitory activity and heparin binding. Antithrombin used in the forced oxidation experiments was recombinant human AT purified from the milk of transgenic goats as described in Ref. 21Edmunds T. Van Patten S.M. Pollock J. Hanson E. Bernasconi R. Higgins E. Manavalan P. Ziomek C. Meade H. McPherson J.M. Cole E.S. Blood. 1998; 91: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Commercially available preparations of human plasma derived AT were obtained from Behringwerke (Kybernin) and Miles (Thrombate III). Nonoxidized AT refers to samples that have not been treated with hydrogen peroxide but may contain some oxidized material. The term “unoxidized” is used here to refer to protein (or peptide) that has been shown to contain no oxidation, for example the A form in Fig. 1. Purified recombinant AT was oxidized to varying degrees using hydrogen peroxide (Sigma catalog no. H-1009) essentially as described by Teh et al. (6Teh L.C. Murphy L.J. Huq N.L. Surus A.S. Friesen H.G. Lazarus L. Chapman G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6472-6477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each reaction contained 200 μg of AT in a total volume of 150 μl (23 μm AT) in 100 mmNH4HCO3, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, with varying concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as indicated. All reactions were carried out for 30 min on ice with two exceptions. The samples referred to as 400/60/ice and 400/60/RT were incubated for 60 min in 400 mm peroxide either on ice or at room temperature, respectively. The reaction was stopped by the addition of immobilized catalase (Sigma catalog no. C-9284), which was subsequently removed by filtration (Rainin Microfilterfuge no. 7016–022). Samples of AT oxidation reactions were applied to a C4 HPLC column (2.1 × 250 mm; 5 μm; narrow bore; Vydac catalog no. 214TP52) equilibrated in 75% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), 25% solvent B (acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and eluted with solvent B using a series of linear gradients as follows: 0–5 min 25–40% solvent B, 5–20 min 40–45% solvent B, 20–25 min 45–80% solvent B. The eluted protein was monitored by absorbance at 215 and 275 nm. For preparative runs involving isolation of the A, B, and C forms of oxidized AT, solvent B was held constant at 45% for 5 min (20–25 min) followed by the 45–80% increase. Fractions were collected automatically on a Gilson FC203B fraction collector. Samples of oxidized AT (50 μg) were reduced and pyridylethylated in denaturing buffer (0.25 m Tris, 6.0m guanidine HCl, pH 8.6) containing β-mercaptoethanol at a ratio of 1000:1 (β-mercaptoethanol:cysteine) and 4-vinylpyridine at a ratio of 1005:1 (4-vinylpyridine:cysteine). Modified protein was desalted by reverse phase HPLC on a C4 guard cartridge into 75% acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, partially dried down on a Speed-vac, and then digested with endoproteinase Lys-C (sequencing grade; Boehringer Mannheim) in 0.25 m Tris-HCl, 0.01m EDTA, pH 8.5, at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w) for 18 h at 37 °C. The resultant digests were quenched and mapped by reverse phase HPLC on a C8 column (2.1 × 150 mm; 5 μm; narrow bore; Vydac catalog no. 208TP5215), equilibrated in 100% solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), 0% solvent B (acetonitrile in 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, and eluted with solvent B using a series of linear gradients as follows: 0–3 min 0% solvent B, 3–43 min 0–20% solvent B, 43–73 min 20–30% solvent B, 73–103 min 30–45% solvent B, 103–131 min 45–90% solvent B. Peptide elution was monitored by absorbance at 215 nm. LC/MS was carried out using a Finnigan TSQ 700 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) interfaced through a Finnigan electrospray ionization source with a Michrom BioResources UMA HPLC system (Auburn, CA). Peptide mapping was carried out on 0.5–1.0-nmol aliquots of AT Lys-C digests, which were separated using a Michrom column (1.0 × 100 mm) packed with Vydac C8 resin. The flow rate was 50 μl/min, and peptides were eluted with a gradient of 0–46% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. HPLC eluant from the UV detector was mixed with methoxyethanol (Pierce)/methanol (Burdick & Jackson, Muskegon, MI) (3:1) at 25 μl/min through a “T” union before entering the electrospray interface. Centroid mass spectra were acquired over anm/z range of 200–3000 at a 3-s scan rate. Unoxidized, singly oxidized, and doubly oxidized forms of the K30 Lys-C peptide were collected from Lys-C maps of AT that had been partially oxidized using 50 mm hydrogen peroxide. For this map, peptides were fractionated using an abbreviated gradient similar to that described above but with the second and third segments shortened to 12 and 8 min, respectively. The isolated peptides (1–2 nmol) were dried, reconstituted in 70% formic acid, and digested with CNBr (CNBr:Met molar ratio of 200:1) for 18 h in the dark at room temperature with a nitrogen overlay. Reactions were then dried under nitrogen, reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by LC/MS as described above except that a Vydac C18 column (1.0 × 100 mm) was used with a gradient of 10–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid over 30 min. AT activity was assayed as described previously (21Edmunds T. Van Patten S.M. Pollock J. Hanson E. Bernasconi R. Higgins E. Manavalan P. Ziomek C. Meade H. McPherson J.M. Cole E.S. Blood. 1998; 91: 4561-4571Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by measuring inhibition of thrombin (Calbiochem catalog no. 605190; 243 milliunits/ml in the assay)-catalyzed cleavage of the thrombin-specific chromogenic substrate S2238 (Kabi; 337 μm in the assay). A saturating concentration of heparin (55.5 nm; porcine; Sigma catalog no. H-3393) was used except where noted. In calculations of the molar concentration of heparin, the molecular mass was assumed to be 13,500 daltons for this heparin preparation. Binding of heparin to AT was analyzed by fluorescence enhancement as described by Fanet al. (22Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Choay J. Zettlmeissl G. Gettins P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17588-17596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of AT were diluted to 20 nmin 4 ml of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, pH 7.4. Fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm (5-nm bandwidth) and an emission wavelength of 340 nm (10-nm bandwidth). Heparin (porcine; Sigma catalog no. H-3393) was added sequentially in 1-μl aliquots (up to 14 μl total added volume) and allowed to mix for 20 s prior to measuring the resulting increase in fluorescence. Heparin binding affinity of the various samples of oxidized AT was also compared by relative retention on a heparin affinity column (Toso-Haas TSK-Gel Heparin-5PW; 5-mm inner diameter × 50 mm) as described by Fan et al. (22Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Choay J. Zettlmeissl G. Gettins P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17588-17596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of AT were applied to the column equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.4 (HAC buffer) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Protein was eluted from the column using a linear gradient of 0–3 m NaCl in HAC buffer over 20 min while monitoring absorbance at 215 nm. CD measurements for the oxidized and nonoxidized AT samples were carried out on a JASCO 720 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Oxidized samples were prepared as outlined above. All samples were in ammonium bicarbonate reaction buffer, pH 8.0. Oxidized samples used for the CD measurements were as follows: (i) 50 mm hydrogen peroxide incubated for 30 min on ice, (ii) 400 mm hydrogen peroxide incubated for 60 min on ice (400/60/ice), and (iii) 400 mm hydrogen peroxide incubated for 60 min at room temperature (400/60/RT). Measurements were made both in the far and near ultraviolet region using 0.01 cm (far UV) and 1 cm (near UV) cuvettes. Spectra were scanned 45 times, averaged, smoothed, and base line-corrected. The concentration of AT samples varied between 0.92 and 0.99 mg/ml. For heparin binding studies, heparin was added at saturating concentration to AT samples (123 μm). To eliminate the contribution of heparin to the CD signal, the same amount of heparin was also added to the buffer, and the buffer-heparin CD was subtracted from the sample. Incubation of AT with hydrogen peroxide resulted in a concentration-dependent shift in the reverse phase HPLC mobility of the protein to shorter retention times. We used this forced oxidation as a means of characterizing the sites on AT that are most sensitive to oxidation and to study the effect of oxidation on protein function. We refer here to the predominant peak prior to oxidation as the A form of the protein and to the two earlier eluting peaks that increase with oxidation as the B and C forms, as shown in Fig.1. The discrete shift to less hydrophobic forms with increasing oxidation suggests that each peak represents a distinct oxidized form of the protein. Quantitation of the peaks in Fig. 1 by integration of absorbance (inset) illustrates the transition from the A to the B to the C forms with increasing peroxide concentration. Other relatively minor peaks eluting even earlier than the C form were apparent following treatment with the highest concentrations of peroxide. Samples of oxidized AT from the reactions represented in Fig. 1 were reduced, alkylated, and digested with Lys-C endoproteinase. The resulting digests were fractionated by HPLC, and these peptide maps are shown in Fig.2 A. The only two peptides significantly affected by oxidation were the K2 peptide (residues Pro12–Lys28 in AT) and the K30 peptide (residues Glu298–Lys332 in AT). The peaks corresponding to these peptides and their oxidized counterparts were identified by LC/MS analysis of the digests as shown for the K30 peptide in Fig. 2 B. There was a substantial decrease in the amount of unoxidized K30 peptide in the digest as the peroxide concentration was increased, and there was a corresponding increase in peaks having somewhat shorter retention times. LC/MS analysis of the digests (Fig. 2 B) revealed that the three peaks eluting at 94–96 min in the oxidized samples correspond to K30 plus 16 mass units (singly oxidized K30), and the overlapping peaks at ∼88 min correspond to K30 plus 32 mass units (doubly oxidized K30). There is a similar change in the K2 peptide, although at higher peroxide concentrations, and peaks corresponding to singly and doubly oxidized K2 were again shown to be present using mass spectrometry. From these experiments, it appears that the K30 region of AT is the most sensitive to oxidation, followed by the K2 region. The K30 peptide from AT contains three methionines and one tryptophan as possible sites of oxidation. One of the methionines (Met320) is buried within the core of the intact protein and is therefore an unlikely target of oxidation. The other two methionine residues (Met314 and Met315) are exposed at the surface of the protein and are in fact adjacent to the active site loop that is cleaved during serpin inhibition, based on the three-dimensional structure of AT (Fig.3). The tryptophan residue in K30 (Trp307) is partially exposed in the intact protein (not seen in Fig. 3, since it is on the opposite side of the protein) and therefore could be oxidized; however, tryptophan oxidation is less likely under the conditions used here. The K2 peptide contains two methionines (Met17 and Met20), which are both exposed at the surface of the intact protein and are at one end of the binding site for heparin, which stretches along helix D (Fig. 3). To determine the specific sites of oxidation on K30, the three singly oxidized peaks and one doubly oxidized peak of the K30 peptide were collected along with unoxidized K30 from Lys-C peptide maps of partially oxidized AT as shown in Fig.4 A. The three singly oxidized peaks were designated x, y, and z for the purposes of this analysis. Each of the isolated peptides was subjected to CNBr digestion, which would be expected to result in four peptide fragments in the case of unoxidized K30 (M1–M4; Fig. 4 B). These digests were analyzed by LC/MS using a short reverse phase HPLC gradient, and the observed masses for each digest are listed in TableI. Oxidation of a given methionine residue should not only result in an increase of 16 mass units for peptides containing that methionine, it should also prevent cleavage at that site and therefore result in the absence of specific peptides in the digest (23Gross E. Morell J.L. Lee P.Q. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1968; 151: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). CNBr digestion was not complete in all cases as evidenced by the presence of M(2–3), M(3–4), and M(2–4) in the digest of unoxidized K30. Also, M2 is a single amino acid and is therefore too small to be detectable by this analysis. Nevertheless, the absence of M3 in the singly oxidized (x) digest, along with the fact that M1 and M4 were present, indicates that cleavage did not occur at Met315 and therefore that this methionine was oxidized. This is supported by the fact that M(2–3) and M(2–4) displayed an increase of 16 mass units in this digest. Similarly, M1 was absent in the singly oxidized y and zdigests, while M3 and M4 were present, indicating that oxidation of Met314 blocked cleavage between M1 and M2. Once again this was supported by a 16-mass unit increase in M(1–2) and M(1–3). The digest of the doubly oxidized K30 peptide contained only M(1–3) (plus 32 mass units) and M4, indicating that both Met314 and Met315 are oxidized in this peptide. The absence of an M1 + 16 mass units peptide in any of the oxidized K30 peaks demonstrates that Trp307 is not oxidized under these conditions.Table IMass analysis of oxidized K30 peptides digested with CNBrM1M3M4M (1Swaim M.W.

Open table in a new tab Underlined numbers are peptide masses that display an increase of +16 or +32, indicating that the peptide is either singly or doubly oxidized, respectively. As shown in Table I, the y and z forms of K30 resulted in identical sets of peptides in the CNBr digest but were clearly separated on the HPLC of the original peptide map (Fig.4 A). The most likely explanation for this is that these two peptides are stereoisomers with respect to the added oxygen atom on the chiral sulfur of Met314. Such separation of stereoisomers of oxidized peptides by HPLC has been reported previously (24Joppich-Kuhn R. Corkill J.A. Giese R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In some maps, peak splitting was also seen for oxidation at Met315(peak x), although this was not as distinct as for the peptide oxidized at Met314. Peak splitting of doubly oxidized K30 was consistently observed in the maps (see Figs. 2 and 4 A), presumably for the same reason. Two different commercially available preparations of AT (Kybernin from Behringwerke and Thrombate III from Miles) as well as transgenic recombinant AT (Genzyme Transgenics Corp.) were tested for the presence of oxidized forms (Fig. 5) employing the reverse phase HPLC method used in Fig. 1. Each of these preparations contained the B, and to a lesser extent C, oxidized forms of AT. The A, B, and C forms of AT were isolated in this manner from both a peroxide-oxidized sample of recombinant AT (50 mmperoxide) and one that had not been treated with peroxide. They were each then Lys-C-mapped as described above. The peptide maps for the three isolated forms from the untreated sample (Fig.6) were comparable with those for the three forms isolated from the peroxide-treated sample (data not shown), with oxidation again occurring primarily in the K2 and K30 regions of the protein. The fact that oxidation was consistently seen in AT isolated from both plasma and milk suggested that oxidation may occurin vivo as a means of controlling the activity of this protein.Figure 6Analysis of isolated oxidized forms of AT. Lys-C peptide maps of isolated A, B, and C peaks from C4 reverse phase HPLC of untreated, inherently oxidized AT. Peaks corresponding to the unoxidized (No Ox), singly oxidized (1 Ox), and doubly oxidized (2 Ox) forms of the K2 and K30 peptides were quantitated by integration of the 215-nm absorbance, and each was expressed as a percentage of the total area for each peptide in the accompanying bar graph. mAU, milliabsorbance units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Peaks corresponding to unoxidized, singly oxidized, and doubly oxidized K2 and K30 in Fig. 6 were integrated for each of the three isolated forms of intact AT, and the results are shown in the bar graphs to the right. The amount of each oxidized form for each peptide is plotted relative to the total amount of that peptide. These data clearly show that the B and C forms correlate well with singly and doubly oxidized K30, respectively, indicating that it is oxidation of K30 that is primarily responsible for the shift in retention time seen for intact AT with oxidation (Fig. 1). As mentioned above, the K30 region of AT contains two adjacent methionines on the surface of the protein (Fig. 3), which are in close proximity to the reactive loop of AT that binds to thrombin and is subsequently cleaved. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect that oxidation of one or both of these residues might affect the ability of AT to bind and inhibit thrombin. Samples of untreated (nonoxidized) antithrombin and AT oxidized to various levels were assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” at multiple concentrations of AT in the presence of saturating concentrations of heparin (Fig.7 A). In the sample of AT that was oxidized using 50 mm peroxide for 30 min on ice, ∼80% of the protein was oxidized to at least some degree, based on the data of Fig. 1, yet there was no difference in its ability to inhibit thrombin in this assay. The sample of AT that was oxidized with 400 mm peroxide for 60 min on ice (400/60/ice) was >95% oxidized, but even this preparation was able to inhibit thrombin nearly as effectively as nonoxidized AT in this assay.

Previous studies suggested FinO bound to the smooth 14-base pair helix of stem-loop II. In this investigation, RNA mobility shift analysis was used to study the interaction between a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FinO fusion protein and a series of synthetic FinP andtraJ mRNA variants. Mutations in 16 of the 28 bases in stem II of FinP that are predicted to disrupt base pairing did not significantly alter the GST-FinO binding affinity. Removal of the single-stranded regions on either side of stem-loop II led to a dramatic decrease in GST-FinO binding to FinP and to the complementary region of the traJ mRNA leader. While no evidence for sequence-specific contacts was found, the results suggest that FinO recognizes the overall shape of the RNA and is influenced by the length of the single-stranded regions flanking the stem-loop.

An excellent example is the FinOP fertility inhibition system, which controls the transfer frequency of F-like conjugative plasmids. Expression of the plasmid transfer genes is positively regulated by the TraJ protein, which is required for activation of transcription from the major transfer operon promoter, pY. Expression of traJ is negatively regulated by the combined actions of the finO and finP gene products. FinP is a plasmid-specific ∼79-base antisense RNA molecule, complementary to part of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR)1 of traJmRNA (1Mullineaux P. Willetts N.S. Helinski D.R. Cohen S.N. Clewell D.B.

The FinP secondary structure (GenBank accession number U01159) (4van Biesen T. Söderbom F. Wagner E.G.H. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) consists of 2 stem-loop (SL) domains, separated by a 4-base spacer and terminated by a 6-base tail (Fig.1). The 5′-UTR of traJmRNA forms the mirror image of FinP, with the traJ RBS and start codon being localized to SLIc (complementary to FinP SLI). The traJ leader also contains an extensive single-stranded region and a third stem-loop, SLIII, at its 5′ end. Binding of FinP to the traJ UTR is believed to sequester the traJRBS, preventing its translation and repressing plasmid transfer. FinP requires a protein cofactor, FinO, to exert its negative effect ontraJ expression. FinO is a 21.2-kDa basic protein (5van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), which has been shown to bind FinP SLII and traJ mRNA in vitro, increasing the rate of duplex formation (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Binding of FinO to FinP also protects FinP from RNase E-mediated degradation (7Lee S.H. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar,8Jerome L.J. Frost L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1457-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), increasing its steady-state concentration to a level that allows sequestration and reduced expression of the traJ mRNA (9Koraimann G. Teferle K. Markolin G. Woger W. Högenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The F plasmid is derepressed for transfer (i.e. it transfers constitutively) due to the insertion of an IS3element within its finO gene (10Cheah K.-C. Skurray R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 3269-3275PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yoshioka Y. Ohtsubo H. Ohtsubo E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 619-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This effect can be overcome by supplying a functional finO gene from a related plasmid such as R6–5 (5van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or R100 (12Finnegan D.J. Willetts N.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 127: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) in trans, resulting in a 100–1000-fold reduction in F plasmid transfer. The focus of this study is the specificity of the RNA-protein interaction between FinP antisense RNA and the FinO protein. Eight alleles of FinP have been described for F-like conjugative plasmids (Fig. 2), with sequence identity residing in the stem, spacer and tail regions and variability in the two loops (2Finlay B.B. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Willetts N.S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 754-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two alleles of FinO exist (13Frost L.S. Ippen-Ihler K. Skurray R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 162-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which show very little sequence variation, but are classified on the basis of their levels of repression of F-like plasmids which is tied to their levels of expression (5van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). FinO is not plasmid-specific, which suggests that the loops are unimportant for RNA-protein recognition. The FinO protein does not share homology with any of the protein sequence motifs found in other RNA-binding proteins (14Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 837-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 16Draper D.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 593-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), providing no clues to the amino acid residues involved in RNA recognition. This report presents a preliminary characterization of the RNA targets recognized by FinO. RNA mobility shift analysis was used to determine the binding affinity of a glutathione S-transferase (GST)-FinO fusion protein for a series of synthetic FinP andtraJ mRNA variants. High affinity binding by GST-FinO was shown to be dependent on the presence of SLII, flanked on either side by single-stranded regions. Unexpectedly, mutations that disrupted base pairing in SLII were tolerated, as was the introduction of internal loops. Furthermore, decreasing the length of the 3′ tail reduced GST-FinO binding while altering the sequence had no effect. The same structural features were recognized in traJ mRNA, suggesting that FinO does not make sequence-specific contacts with the RNA, but recognizes its overall shape. Plasmid pLJ5–13 contains a 105-base pair PCR product with the finP gene fused to the T7 promoter sequence in pUC19 (8Jerome L.J. Frost L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1457-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). During the construction of pLJ5–13, seven spontaneous mutant clones were obtained with single base mutations in stem II (G42:A, G45:A, C46:T, A47:G, G48:A, G49:A, A51:G) and one clone with a double mutation in stem II (C41:T C46:T). RNAs were generated by in vitro transcription from these BamHI-linearized pLJ5–13 mutant plasmids, resulting in the addition of 7 bases (GGGGAUC) to their 3′ ends derived from the BamHI site in the vector. All other RNAs were transcribed from gel-purified PCR products prepared with VentTM DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using the appropriate primers and DNA templates, as detailed in Tables I andII. pOX38-Km has been described previously (17Chandler M.

Uniformly labeled RNAs were prepared byin vitro transcription of DNA templates in reaction mixtures containing 1× T7 RNA polymerase buffer (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 unit/μl RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (Mandel Scientific), 0.5 mm GTP, ATP, and CTP, and 0.02 mm UTP at 37 °C for 1 h. DNA was removed with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim) for 15 min at 37 °C, and the labeled RNA was gel-purified as described (8Jerome L.J. Frost L.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1457-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RNA was stored at −20 °C for 1 week without noticeable degradation. A step of RNA denaturation-renaturation did not improve or modify the binding affinity of the protein; therefore, gel-purified RNA was used directly for gel-shift analysis. pGEX-FO2 (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was used for expression of a protein fusion between GST and R6–5 FinO. GST-FinO was purified using glutathione-agarose affinity as described (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), except that the cells were lysed using a French press, rather than by sonication (18Sandercock J.R. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The ability of GST-FinO to bind each RNA was assessed by RNA mobility shift analysis (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 7.5 fmol of32P-labeled RNA was incubated with increasing amounts of GST-FinO (0–31.9 pmol) in a total volume of 30 μl for 30 min at room temperature in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (RNase/DNase-free; Boehringer Mannheim), 7.6 units of RNAguard (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 10% glycerol. Samples were loaded onto a continuously running (150 V) 6% or 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer and electrophoresed at room temperature for 1.5 h. Bands were visualized by autoradiography and phosphorimaging and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 445 SI. The equilibrium association constant (K a) for GST-FinO binding was calculated from the protein concentration that caused 50% of the labeled RNA to shift in the gel (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Tsai M.-M. Fu Y.-H.F. Deonier R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 4603-4609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For RNA variants that gave more than one band shift,Ka values were calculated by considering all bound RNA as a single species. Except where noted,K a values were calculated from three independent determinations. The percent binding relative to FinP was calculated as 100 × (K a variant/K aFinP). We have previously shown that a fusion of FinO from the related plasmid, R6–5, to GST is active in vivo and in vitro (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 18Sandercock J.R. Frost L.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GST-FinO and FinO obtained from thrombin cleavage of the fusion protein bind to FinP RNA with equal affinity. 2M. J. Gubbins and L. S. Frost, unpublished data. In the present study, the relative equilibrium association constants for GST-FinO binding to FinP variants were determined by performing gel-shift assays in which radiolabeled RNA was combined with increasing amounts of purified GST-FinO protein. Labeled RNA was synthesized by in vitro run-off transcription using PCR-generated templates or cloned fragments (see “Experimental Procedures”). Transcripts prepared from cloned fragments contained 7 additional bases (GGGGAUC) at their 3′ ends derived from the BamHI site in the vector used to linearize the plasmids. To ensure that the 7 bases from the vector did not alter the binding constants, FinP RNA and the quadruple mutant, FinP C41:U/C46:U/G66:U/G71:U, with or without the additional 3′ bases, were synthesized. The presence of the 7 extra bases at the 3′ end had no effect on GST-FinO binding (data not shown). A comparison of GST-FinO binding affinities to FinP, SLI (nucleotides 1–34, Fig. 1) and SLII (nucleotides 35–79), which were transcribed from PCR-generated templates, is shown in Fig.3. The K a for GST-FinO binding to FinP was 2.0 × 107m−1, 50-fold higher than that for SLI and 2-fold higher than SLII (summarized in TableIII). These values are higher than previously reported (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and likely reflect an increase in the fraction of active GST-FinO in preparations using the French press method for cell lysis, rather than sonication. Since the fraction of GST-FinO that is active was not determined, these values may still be underestimated. As a negative control, incubation of either FinP, SLI or SLII with GST alone did not result in the formation of shifted species in the gel (data not shown). This indicated that the complexes formed in the presence of the fusion protein were the result of RNA interaction with FinO.Table IIIGST-FinO binding to FinP variantsFinP variantaVariants are F unless otherwise stated.107 K abKa values are an average of two or more independent gel shifts.BindingcPercentage of binding relative to F FinP [= 100 × (Ka variant/KaF FinP)].m−1%FinP2.00100SLII1.1055SLI0.042SLI A12:U0.042Stem II mutationsG42:A1.3970G45:A1.5477C46:U1.5779A47:G1.3970G48:A1.1457G49:A1.8291A51:G1.1357C41:U/C46:U1.3668G66:U/G71:U1.3065C46:U/G66:U/G71:U1.5075C41:U/C46:U/G66:U/G71:U1.8090C62:A/C63:A/C64:A1.7085C70:A/G71:U/G72:U/C73:A1.4068OtherColB21.9598R100-12.34117Measurement of GST-FinO binding to FinP variants was determined by gel-shift analysis using 7.5 fmol of uniformly labelled RNAs in the presence of increasing amounts of GST-FinO, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Ka values were calculated from the GST-FinO concentration that caused 50% of the RNA to shift in the gel.a Variants are F unless otherwise stated.b Ka values are an average of two or more independent gel shifts.c Percentage of binding relative to F FinP [= 100 × (Ka variant/KaF FinP)].

In agreement with the results of van Biesen and Frost (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), these results suggest that the major determinants for FinO binding reside in SLII, which prompted us to look for differences between SLI and SLII. The most notable structural difference between SLI and SLII is an A-A mismatch within stem I (Fig. 1). SLI A12:U, which creates an A:U base pair (bp) at this site, results in a fully duplexed SLI. Its ability to bind GST-FinO was tested and when compared with SLI with the natural A-A mismatch, was not increased (Table III). Thus, this 11-bp helix was not sufficient for recognition. A second obvious difference between stem-loops I and II is the sequence of the loops. To determine if the loops contributed to the specificity of GST-FinO binding, FinP RNAs from ColB2 and R100–1 were synthesized. ColB2 loop I is identical to F, but differs at 6 of the 7 bases comprising loop II (Fig. 2). R100–1 differs from F at 1 base in loop I and 2 bases in loop II, which is also 1 base smaller than F loop II. The K a for GST-FinO binding to ColB2 was almost identical to F and was slightly increased for R100–1 (Table III). These results indicate that the sequences of the loops are unimportant for FinO binding. The sequences of the two FinP stems, although highly conserved among the finP alleles (Fig. 2), differ significantly from each other and could account for the preference of GST-FinO for SLII. The effect of mutations in stem II of full-length FinP on GST-FinO binding were examined, and the binding data are summarized in Table III. Spontaneous single base mutations on the 5′ side of stem II (G42:A, G45:A, C46:U) reduced the corresponding affinity constants by no more than 30% when compared with wild-type. In the 5′ upper half of stem II, A47:G (naturally present in R100–1) and G49:A did not significantly reduce GST-FinO binding, whereas G48:A and A51:G reduced binding by about 50%. Each of these mutations is expected to disrupt Watson-Crick base pairing, reducing the helical length of stem II. The C41:U/C46:U double mutant, which could lead to formation of two non-Watson-Crick G:U base pairs and maintain the helicity of SLII, showed a 30% reduction in binding constant. To disrupt these potential interactions, FinP variants G66:U/G71:U, C46:U/G66:U/C71:U and C41:U/C46:U/G66:U/G71:U were constructed (Table III). None of these mutations significantly altered GST-FinO binding, suggesting that a continuous duplex is not important for efficient binding. In agreement with this, mutation of 4 consecutive base pairs at the base of stem II (C70:A/G71:U/G72:U/C73:A) and 3 base pairs in the 3′ upper half of stem II (C62:A/C63:A/C64:A) had only minimal effects on GST-FinO binding (Table III). Since the stem II point mutants examined did not significantly alter the binding affinity of GST-FinO, we turned our attention to the conserved single-stranded regions of FinP: the 5′ leader, spacer, and 3′ tail. Removal of 3 bases from the 5′ leader following the initiating G required for T7 RNA polymerase transcription (FinP ΔA2,U3,A4) had little effect on binding affinity (TableIV); however, the spacer and tail regions proved to be important, as shown in Fig.4 and summarized in Table IV. Deletion of either the spacer or 3′ tail from SLII had minor to moderate effects on GST-FinO binding, reducing the K a values by 1.3-fold and 5.5-fold, respectively. Deletion of both the spacer and 3′ tail from SLII had a profound effect, reducing the binding constant 14-fold.Table IVThe tail length, but not sequence, is critical for FinP recognitionF FinP variant107 K aaUnless otherwise stated, K a values are averages ± standard deviation of at least three independent gel shifts.BindingbPercentage binding relative to F FinP [=100 × (K a variant/KaF FinP)].m−1%FinP2.00 ± 0.20100FinP ΔA2, U3, A41.50cK a values are averages of two independent gel shifts.75FinP G74:C/A75:C1.40cK a values are averages of two independent gel shifts.68SLIISpacer-SLII-GAUUUU1.10 ± 0.0255Spacer-SLII (no tail)0.20 ± 0.0410SLII-GAUUUU (no spacer)0.82 ± 0.0541SLII (no spacer, no tail)0.08 ± 0.014Spacer-SLII-GAUU0.38 ± 0.0519Spacer-SLII-GA0.06 ± 0.013SLII-GAAAAA0.69cK a values are averages of two independent gel shifts.35Spacer-SLII-GACA0.36cK a values are averages of two independent gel shifts.18SLISLI0.04 ± 0.012SLI-spacer0.13 ± 0.036SLI-tail0.43 ± 0.0521Binding of GST-FinO to FinP variants was assessed by gel-shift analysis using 7.5 fmol of uniformly labelled RNAs in the presence of various concentrations of GST-FinO, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” K a values were calculated from the GST-FinO concentration that caused 50% of the RNA to shift in the gel.a Unless otherwise stated, K a values are averages ± standard deviation of at least three independent gel shifts.b Percentage binding relative to F FinP [=100 × (K a variant/KaF FinP)].c K a values are averages of two independent gel shifts.

In order to determine whether FinO had a nonspecific affinity for single-stranded RNA, the ability of polyuridylic acid to compete with FinP for GST-FinO binding was tested. The results (data not shown) indicate that the GST-FinO/FinP interaction was unaffected by the presence of a large molar excess of polyuridylic acid. These results suggest that the single-stranded spacer and 3′ tail make important contributions to a higher order structure recognized by FinO. The nucleotide sequences of synthetic stem-loops I and II were arbitrarily chosen (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) such that SLI includes the 5′ leader and stem-loop I, whereas SLII includes the spacer, stem-loop II and 3′ tail (Fig. 1). Since GST-FinO binding to SLII was strongly dependent on the presence of both single-stranded flanking sequences, the observed low affinity of GST-FinO for SLI might be due to the absence of a 3′ single-stranded region. To test this hypothesis, SLI variants were constructed that had either the spacer or tail sequence added to their 3′ ends. When assayed for GST-FinO binding, the K avalues for SLI-spacer and SLI-tail were increased 3-fold and 10-fold, respectively (Fig. 5; Table IV). These results clearly demonstrate the importance of the 3′ flanking sequence to the structure recognized by GST-FinO. The effect of decreasing the length of the 3′ tail following SLII on GST-FinO binding was examined since addition of a 7-base extension had no effect (see above). Shortening of the SLII 3′ tail from 6 bases (GAUUUU) to 4 bases (GAUU) decreased theK a 3-fold to 0.38 × 107m−1 (Fig. 6; Table IV). A further reduction in tail length to 2 bases (GA) decreased the K a another 6-fold to 0.06 × 107m−1. These results suggest that a minimum 6-base 3′ tail is necessary for efficient binding by GST-FinO. To determine whether the presence of the 3′ tail reflected a sequence-specific or general requirement for additional bases flanking SLII, variants SLII-GAAAAA, spacer-SLII-GACA, and FinP G74:C/A75:C were constructed (Table IV). The sequence of each variant was chosen to avoid introducing any other obvious secondary structural features. Comparison of the variant pairs (SLII-GAAAAA with SLII-tail; spacer-SLII-GACA with spacer-SLII-GAUU and FinP G74:C/A75:C with wild-type FinP) in Table IV shows that these base transversions in the 3′ tail had minor effects on GST-FinO binding. These results indicate that the length, but not sequence, of the FinP 3′ tail is important for high affinity binding by GST-FinO. The results of an earlier study (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that GST-FinO binds to a truncated 184-base version of the sense mRNA,traJ, with a K a similar to that for FinP. The sequence and secondary structure of the first 117 bases of FtraJ are shown in Fig. 1. The secondary structure oftraJ RNA between nucleotides 33 and 111 is almost identical to FinP, with the following exceptions: SLIc of traJmRNA has an additional mismatch (A-C), which is paired in FinP SLI; SLIIc of traJ is 2 bases shorter than SLII of FinP, resulting in a 6-base traJ spacer, as compared with 4 bases for FinP. To further characterize the interaction between GST-FinO and F plasmid-encoded traJ184 (previously called TraJ211, Ref. 6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), a series of 3′ truncated traJ variants were created and their binding to GST-FinO was compared with that of FinP. As seen in Fig. 7, addition of increasing amounts of GST-FinO led to the conversion of low molecular weight bands to one or more higher molecular weight bands (see “Discussion” for further comments). GST-FinO bound traJ184 almost as well as FinP (95%), with a K a of 1.9 × 107m−1. Deletion of 74 bases from the 3′ end oftraJ184, creating traJ110 (see Fig. 1), yielded a modest 25% reduction in GST-FinO binding to 1.4 × 107m−1. Removal of SLIc fromtraJ110, which results in a transcribed product of 77 bases (traJ77; similar to SLII of FinP, Fig. 1) reduced GST-FinO binding by 48% to 0.73 × 107m−1. This is similar to the 45% reduction in the binding constant observed for the removal of SLI from FinP (see Fig. 3; Table III). Further mutation of traJ77 to eliminate the spacer residues 3′ to SLIIc (A72 to C77), creatingtraJ71, decreased the K a for GST-FinO binding another 53% to 0.34 × 107m−1. As with FinP, this result suggests that SLIIc and its 3′ flanking sequence are important determinants for high affinity GST-FinO binding. This report describes the structural features of RNA recognized by the FinO protein. RNA-binding proteins have generally been shown to target single-stranded regions caused by loops, bulges, and mismatches or between helical stems, rather than the duplexed regions themselves (14Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 837-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 20Steitz T.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 219-237Google Scholar, 21Varani G. Pardi A. Nagai K. Mattaj I.W. RNA-Protein Interactions. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994: 1-24Google Scholar). Duplexed regions are necessary, however, for spacing and presentation of the single-stranded nucleotides in the correct orientation (20Steitz T.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 219-237Google Scholar). The hairpin loops represent an obvious single-stranded region of FinP available for protein binding. Three lines of evidence suggest that FinO does not make sequence-specific contacts with bases in the FinP loops. First, although the loop sequences vary between finP alleles (2Finlay B.B. Frost L.S. Paranchych W. Willetts N.S. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 754-757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), FinO is exchangeable among F-like plasmids (5van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22Willetts N.S. Maule J. Genet. Res. 1986; 47: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Second, the traJmRNA loops are complementary in sequence to FinP, and yet GST-FinO bound traJ and FinP with nearly equal affinity (Figs. 3 and7). Third, GST-FinO bound F, ColB2, and R100–1 FinPs with the same relative affinity, even though the sequences of the loops vary considerably, especially within loop II. The results reported by van Biesen and Frost (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and in this study indicate that the sequence between nucleotides 35 and 79 (SLII) of FinP is sufficient and necessary for high affinity GST-FinO binding. Stem II is fully duplexed in FinP and presents a relatively poor sequence-specific target for FinO. Attempts to disrupt the helical nature of SLII by introduction of internal loops and base substitutions were freely tolerated, indicating that a continuous duplex is not necessary for FinO binding. In agreement with this, single mutations at three of the sites tested (C41, C46, G49) and at G50, had no effect on FinP repressor activity from the related conjugative plasmid R1, as measured by conjugation frequency (23Koraimann G. Koraimann C. Koronakis V. Schlager S. Högenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the mutant FinP RNAs are also fully stabilized in vivo by FinO (9Koraimann G. Teferle K. Markolin G. Woger W. Högenauer G. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results indirectly demonstrate that FinO binding is not affected by these base substitutions in vivo, in accord with the results obtained in this study, in vitro. Earlier studies (6van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) showed that GST-FinO could bind to a FinP/traJ184 duplex or a duplex formed between SLI and the complementary sequence of traJ mRNA. However, the present results indicate that the 14-bp duplex, SLII alone, was not sufficient for high affinity binding by GST-FinO. These apparently conflicting results can be reconciled by the finding that single-stranded regions adjacent to the duplexed RNA were necessary for binding by GST-FinO. In this respect, FinO resembles the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP), which binds to the 3′ end of histone mRNA in mammalian cells (24Williams A.S. Marzluff W.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 654-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Efficient binding by SLBP requires at least three nucleotides each 3′ and 5′ of a stem-loop. FinO requires at least 6 nucleotides 3′ to SLII and as many as 4 nucleotides 5′ to SLII, although the length of the 5′ spacer was not examined in this study. Like FinO, SLBP does not have a strict loop size requirement, suggesting that specific contacts do not involve the loop. However, unlike the interaction between FinO and FinP, the sequence of the stem and flanking regions is important for SLBP binding. Since no evidence was obtained for sequence-specific contacts between GST-FinO and FinP, our data suggest that FinO recognizes the overall shape of the RNA conferred by a stem-loop structure, flanked on either side by single-stranded regions. Congruent with this, GST-FinO recognizes the same structural features in traJ mRNA. The requirement for a 6-nucleotide flanking region 3′ to SLIIc is fulfilled by the traJ spacer, which is 2 bases longer than the FinP spacer (Fig. 1). In addition the traJ spacer, which differs from the FinP 3′ tail at 4 of the 6 bases, can serve as a functional 3′ flanking region, indicating that sequence is unimportant for binding by FinO. Addition of the FinP tail sequence (GAUUUU) to the 3′ side of SLI conferred moderate GST-FinO binding, although the binding constant was 2-fold lower than that for SLII with the equivalent 3′ tail. These results suggest that the RNA conformation recognized by GST-FinO can be adopted quite efficiently by three different sequences: traJ mRNA with its 6-base single-stranded spacer, SLI with the FinP 3′ tail, and SLII with the 3′ tail. The functionally related RNA-binding protein, Rom, has also been shown to recognize RNA in a structure-dependent, rather than sequence-dependent fashion. Rom binds to an unstable complex formed between the complementary hairpin loops of RNA I and RNA II of ColE1 plasmids (25Tomizawa J. Som T. Cell. 1984; 38: 871-878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The results of three independent studies indicate that Rom is capable of binding and stabilizing any complex formed by pairs containing fully complementary loop sequences (26Eguchi Y. Tomizawa J.-I. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Predki P.F. Nayak L.M. Gottlieb M.B.C. Regan L. Cell. 1995; 80: 41-50Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 28Gregorian R.Z. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 968-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rom has been shown to extend the average half-life of general pulse-labeled Escherichia coli mRNA (29Sozhamannan S. Stitt B.L. J. Mol.

Like Rom, FinO might have many targets in the cell, but the role of FinO in promoting duplex formation can occur only when it is bound to complementary RNAs. GST-FinO binds pBR322 antisense RNA I with an affinity constant of 1.4 × 107m−1, 70% of that for FinP. 3L. J. Jerome and L. S. Frost, unpublished data. The secondary structure of pBR322 RNA I consists of a 9-base leader followed by three stem-loop domains, with a 2-base spacer between stem-loops I and II (30Helmer-Citterich M. Anceschi M.M. Banner D.W. Cesareni G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Tamm J. Polisky B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6381-6397Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the region of RNA I bound by FinO has not been determined, it is conceivable that FinO has a nonspecific affinity for the third stem-loop, which lacks a 3′ tail, but is longer than 14 bp. Further experiments are needed to define the binding site and establish the specificity of this interaction. Interestingly, binding of GST-FinO to traJ184 gave rise to four shifted bands of different mobility, with the largest complex being retained in the well (Fig. 7). The fastest migrating complex was converted to more slowly migrating complexes with increasing GST-FinO concentration. GST-FinO interaction with traJ110 resulted in three distinct complexes, whereas two complexes were formed with eithertraJ77 or traJ71. One possible explanation for the formation of multiple complexes may be stepwise binding of GST-FinO monomers to multiple sites on its RNA target. The bands retained in the well likely represent complexes formed due to GST-FinO aggregation. Cooperative binding has been reported for the human immunodeficiency virus Rev-RRE interaction (32Iwai S.

Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9983-9994sCrossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A closer look at GST-FinO binding to its antisense RNA targets (Fig. 3) shows that only one complex was formed between GST-FinO and either SLI or SLII, whereas two complexes were formed with full-length FinP (more readily distinguishable by under-exposure of this gel; data not shown). Although the strongest GST-FinO binding was achieved with SLII, low affinity binding was observed between GST-FinO and SLI with its attached 4-base spacer. Thus, binding of GST-FinO to its primary binding site, SLII, may promote binding to the low affinity site, SLI, resulting in the more slowly migrating complex observed at high GST-FinO concentrations. Similarly, the higher molecular weight complexes observed with the traJ RNA variants may represent successive GST-FinO binding to stem-loops IIc, Ic, and III. Further experiments are needed to determine the specificity of FinO binding to these potential low affinity sites. In addition, since the physiological FinO concentration is not presently known but is thought to be low, based on mRNA levels (5van Biesen T. Frost L.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 771-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), the relevance of the higher molecular weight complexes, which are formed at high FinO concentrations, remains to be established."
https://openalex.org/W2026557891,"The LEC11 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) gain-of-function mutant expresses an α(1,3)fucosyltransferase (α(1,3)Fuc-T) activity that generates the LeX, sialyl-LeX, and VIM-2 glycan determinants and has been extensively used for studies of E-selectin ligand specificity. In order to identify regulatory mechanisms that control α(1,3)Fuc-T expression in mammals, mechanisms of FUT gene expression were investigated in LEC11 cells and two new, independent mutants, LEC11A and LEC11B. Northern and ribonuclease protection analyses, using probes that span the coding region of a cloned CHO FUT gene, detected transcripts in each LEC11 mutant but not in CHO cells or other gain-of-function CHO mutants that express a different α(1,3)Fuc-T activity. Coding region sequence analysis and α(1,3)Fuc-T acceptor specificity comparisons with recombinant human Fuc-TV and Fuc-TVI showed that the cloned FUT gene is orthologous to the humanFUT6 gene. Southern analyses identified two closely relatedFUT6 genes in the Chinese hamster, whose evolutionary relationships are discussed. The blots showed that rearrangements had occurred in LEC11A and LEC11 genomic DNA, consistent with acis mechanism of FUT6 gene activation in these mutants. By contrast, somatic cell hybrid analyses revealed that LEC11B cells express FUT6 gene transcripts due to the loss of atrans-acting, negative regulatory factor. Sequencing of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products identified unique 5′- and 3′-untranslated region sequences in FUT6 gene transcripts from each LEC11 mutant. Northern and Southern analyses with gene-specific probes showed that LEC11A cells express only the cgFUT6A gene (where cg is Cricetulus griseus), whereas LEC11 and LEC11B cells express only the cgFUT6B gene. In LEC11A × LEC11B hybrid cells, the cgFUT6A gene was predominantly expressed, as predicted if atrans-acting negative regulatory factor functions to suppress cgFUT6B gene expression in CHO cells. This factor is predicted to be a cell type-specific regulator of FUT6 gene expression in mammals.

Because fucose is added last in this synthesis, regulated expression of an α(1,3)Fuc-T activity may be critical to controlling a specific cell-cell adhesion event. This principle was nicely demonstrated in mice by targeted disruption of theFUT7 gene (4Maly P. Thall A. Petryniak B. Rogers C.E. Smith P.L. Marks R.M. Kelly R.J. Gersten K.M. Cheng G. Saunders T.L.

Mice lacking Fuc-TVII exhibit an increase in circulating lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, and eosinophils that rely on ligands fucosylated by Fuc-TVII to bind to selectins on vascular endothelium.

TheFUT3, FUT5, and FUT6 (Lewis) genes reside in a cluster on chromosome 19 (5Reguigne-Arnould I. Wolfe J. Hornigold N. Faure S. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Coullin P. C. R. Acad. Sci.

The transferases encoded by these FUT genes transfer fucose to GlcNAc in lactosamine units to generate the LeX and/or sialyl-LeXdeterminants. Fuc-TIII generates in addition the Lea, Leb, sialyl Lea, and sialyl-Lebdeterminants (9Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The human α(1,3)Fuc-T activities are differentially expressed in adult tissues and in cancer (2Macher B.A. Holmes E.H.

The enhanced ability of cancer cells to express sialyl-LeX has been suggested to aid in their growth and metastatic properties and to correlate with poor prognosis (reviewed in Ref. 12Kannagi R. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the finding that P-selectin-deficient mice exhibit increased experimental metastasis of human colon carcinoma cells (13Kim Y.J. Borsig L. Varki N.M. Varki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9325-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to identify factors that control the expression of theFUT genes and thereby regulate α(1,3)Fuc-T levels and activities in a cell type- or tissue-specific fashion. To date it is known that the 5′-untranslated regions of the FUT3,FUT5, and FUT6 genes are complex and that different transcripts arise from differential splicing (11Cameron H.S. Szczepaniak D. Weston B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20112-20122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but promoter regions of these and related genes have not been isolated. Gain-of-function mutants that express an α(1,3)Fuc-T activity not detectable in wild-type cells provide an approach to identifying factors that serve to regulate FUT gene expression in vivo (14Stanley P. Raju T.S. Bhaumik M. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 695-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The LEC11 CHO mutant expresses an α(1,3)Fuc-T activity that generates the LeX, sialyl-LeX, and VIM-2 determinants on cell-surface glycans (15Campbell C. Stanley P.

Since the de novo expression of an α(1,3)Fuc-T activity in gain-of-function LEC11 CHO mutants provides an approach to identifying regulatory mechanisms that operate in vivo, we investigated the molecular basis of α(1,3)Fuc-T gene expression in three independent LEC11 mutants. We show in this paper that each LEC11 mutant expresses one of two Chinese hamster (Cricetulus griseus; cg) FUT genes that are both orthologous to the humanFUT6 gene, whereas CHO cells contain no cgFUT6 gene transcripts by RNase protection analysis. Invesigations of somatic cell hybrids formed between LEC11 mutants and CHO cells, as well as LEC11 mutants with each other and with other gain-of-function mutants, show that LEC11 and LEC11A mutants arose by a cis-dominant mechanism probably due to rearrangement of a cgFUT6 gene. By contrast, LEC11B cells arose by a trans-recessive mechanism, due to the loss of a negative regulatory factor that controls expression of the cgFUT6B gene.

After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold deionized, distilled water. When 2′-fucosyllactose or LacNAc was the substrate, all product was eluted from 1.5-ml ion exchange columns (Dowex 1 × 4, Cl− form) with 2 ml of deionized, distilled water. However, complete elution of product when 2′-fucosylLacNAc or SAα(2,3)LacNAc was the acceptor required an additional wash with 3 ml of 0.1 m or 0.15 m NaCl. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Genomic DNA from Lec1 CHO cells was partially digested with MboI, and fragments of 9–23 kb were isolated using sodium chloride gradient centrifugation. Size-fractionated DNA fragments were partially filled in with dATP and dGTP and ligated to XhoI-digested λFIXII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) phage arms that also had been partially filled in with dTTP and dCTP. The ligation product was packagedin vitro with packaging extracts from Stratagene and titered on KW251 Escherichia coli host cells. Approximately 7 × 105 recombinants were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized at 42 °C to the 944-bp radiolabeled XbaI-EcoRI fragment isolated from the insert of plasmid pSi+FTE(α1,3/1,4) kindly supplied by Dr. John Lowe (University Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI). This fragment contains most of the coding sequence of the human Lewis enzyme, α(1,3)Fuc-TIII (9Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Larsen R.D. Nair R.P. Lowe J.B. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1288-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). After hybridization for 48 h in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 10× Denhart's solution, 0.1% SDS, 0.8% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA, filters were rinsed twice for 30 min at room temperature in 1× SSC, 0.4% SDS and then three times for 1 h at 45 °C in the same buffer. Hybridizing plaques were purified through three rounds of replica plating. Phage DNA from clone A6.1 contained an ∼9-kb EcoRI fragment and a 3.2-kb SacI fragment that hybridized under stringent conditions (0.2× SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 65 °C) to the 944 bp probe. These two fragments and subclones derived from them were cloned into the pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene), pGEM3Z vector, or pGEM7Zf(+) vectors (Promega), respectively. Plasmids were amplified inE. coli strains XL1-Blue or JM109, and plasmid DNA was purified using Qiagen (Valencia, CA) plasmid preparation kits. DNA sequencing on both strands was performed using automated sequencer models ABI373A and ABI337 (Perkin-Elmer). Reactions were primed with vector-specific oligonucleotides and subsequently with primers derived from the known sequence of the FUT gene. DNA and protein sequence analyses were performed using the GCG Sequence Analysis Software Wisconsin Package version 9.1, Geneworks version 2.5 (30Miller M.J. Powell J.I. J. Comput. Biol. 1994; 1: 257-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), CLUSTAL W version 1.7 (31Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J.

Purified plasmid DNA (2 μg) was mixed with pSV2neo DNA (2 μg) and transfected into Pro−5 CHO cells using the Polybrene method described previously (33Chaney W.G. Howard D.R. Pollard J.W. Sallustio S. Stanley P. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Transfectants selected for resistance to G418 (1.0 mg/ml active weight) were screened for the expression of α(1,3)Fuc-T activity by their ability to bind an αSSEA-1/sRBC conjugate as described (24Potvin B. Stanley P. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 989-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Potvin B. Kumar R. Howard D.R. Stanley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1615-1622Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Positive red colonies were cultured and cell extracts tested for α (1,3)Fuc-T activity. Total RNA from CHO or hybrid cells was prepared using 1 ml of TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 107 cells to obtain ∼150 μg of total RNA. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from ∼108 washed cells using FastTrack 2.0 Kit mRNA Isolation System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to obtain poly(A)+ RNA. RNA was separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized at 60 °C in 50 mm PIPES buffer (pH 6.4), 0.1 mNaCl, 50 mm phosphate buffer, 2 mm EDTA, 5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. Blots were hybridized initially to a 0.6-kb AvaI fragment, representing the 5′-coding sequence of the cloned CHO FUT gene and, after boiling in 0.1% SDS, to a human cardiac actin probe (PstI fragment) (34Rudnicki M.A. Ruben M. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). DNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of ∼109 cpm/μg using the Prime-It RmT dCTP-Labeling kit (Stratagene). Buffer and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by passage through a G-50 minispin column (Worthington). Oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Membranes were finally washed in 1× SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 50 °C. The blot was exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C for at least 24 h. For ribonuclease protection experiments, total or poly(A)+RNA was used with the RPAII Ribonuclease Protection Assay kit from Ambion (Austin, TX) with minor modifications. Riboprobes were labeled by in vitro transcription to 1–2 × 108cpm/μg RNA with [32P]CTP using T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega). Approximately 10 μg of total RNA or 1 μg of poly(A)+ RNA was hybridized overnight to ∼3 fmol of antisense RNA probe at 45 °C. RNase T1 was added at a concentration of 90 units/ml in 220-μl aliquots. Reactions were performed at 37 °C for 50–80 min. Digestion products were denatured and separated by electrophoresis in 5 or 8% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 m urea at 250–300 V for 4–8 h. Nonspecific protection was monitored using yeast tRNA. Protected radiolabeled fragments were visualized by autoradiography. Genomic DNA was prepared by either a standard proteinase K method or the Blood & Cell Culture DNA maxi kit (Qiagen). Digestion of genomic DNA to completion was accomplished using various restriction enzymes from Boehringer Mannheim. DNA fragments were separated by 0.8% agarose-gel electrophoresis at 40 V overnight followed by transfer to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with 20× SSC. After UV cross-linking in a Stratalinker (Stratagene), the membranes were hybridized in Rapid-Hyb buffer at 65 °C for 3 h. DNA fragments were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Prime-It RmT kit (Stratagene) to a specific activity of 109 cpm/μg DNA. After hybridization, blots were finally washed at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC containing 0.2% SDS for 30 min and exposed at −70 °C to Kodak X-Omat films with intensifying screens. Before rehybridization, blots were erased by boiling in 0.1% SDS. For reverse transcription, 1–2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA, 15 pmol of antisense primer, and 1 unit/μl RNasin were heated to 75 °C for 10–15 min and slowly cooled to room temperature before adding 200–400 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase together with First Strand Buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, dTTP to 1 mm and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Reactions were incubated for 2 h at 42 °C, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and stored at −20 °C. PCR reactions were performed using the Expand Long Template PCR System (Boehringer Mannheim) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For amplification of small fragments (<3 kb), PCR buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 16 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.75 mmMgCl2) and 350 μm of each dNTP were used; for amplification of relatively long products PCR buffer 2 (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 16 mm(NH4)2SO4, 2.25 mmMgCl2) and 500 μm of each dNTP were used. Two separate mixes for each reaction were prepared on ice as follows: master mix 1 (up to 25 μl) contained upstream and downstream primers (15 pmol of each), template DNA, and dNTPs; master mix 2 (up to 25 μl) contained PCR buffer, and 0.75 μl of the two thermostable DNA polymerases, Taq and Pw"
https://openalex.org/W2084126518,"The primary product of the prothoracic glands of last instar larvae of Spodoptera littoralis is 3-dehydroecdysone (3DE). After secretion, 3DE is reduced to ecdysone by 3DE 3β-reductase in the hemolymph. We have previously purified and characterized 3DE 3β-reductase from the hemolymph of S. littoralis. In this study, cDNA clones encoding the enzyme were obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, employing primers based on the amino acid sequences, in conjunction with 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Multiple polyadenylation signals and AT-rich elements were found in the 3′-untranslated region, suggesting that this region may have a role in regulation of expression of the gene. Conceptual translation and amino acid sequence analysis suggest that 3DE 3β-reductase from S. littoralis is a new member of the third superfamily of oxidoreductases. Northern analysis shows that 3DE 3β-reductase mRNA transcripts are widely distributed, but are differentially expressed, in some tissues. The developmental profile of the mRNA revealed that the gene encoding 3DE 3β-reductase is only transcribed in the second half of the last larval instar and that this fluctuation in expression accounts for the change in the enzyme activity during the instar. Southern analysis indicates that the 3DE 3β-reductase is encoded by a single gene, which probably contains at least one intron.

In immature stages, the prothoracic glands are the primary source of ecdysteroids, generally ecdysone in most species. However, it has become apparent that in most Lepidopteran species studied, the major product of the glands is 3-dehydroecdysone (3DE),1 together with a varying proportion of ecdysone (2Warren J.T. Sakurai S. Rountree D.B. Gilbert L.I. Lee S.S. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Sakurai S. Warren J.T. Gilbert L.I. Arch.

Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 57-64Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For instance, the glands ofManduca sexta and Pieris brassicae secrete in excess of 95% 3DE, whereas some other Lepidopteran species secrete only a 1:1 ratio (Leucinia separate) and others (Bombyx mori) merely traces of 3DE (2Warren J.T. Sakurai S. Rountree D.B. Gilbert L.I. Lee S.S. Nakanishi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 958-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 3Sakurai S. Warren J.T. Gilbert L.I. Arch.

Thus, even within a single order, the ratio of ecdysteroids from the prothoracic glands are markedly different. The physiological significance of these differences remains to be explained. Previously, we demonstrated that the prothoracic glands of last instar larvae of Spodoptera littoralis primarily secreted 3DE (∼82%), with lesser amounts of ecdysone (∼18%) (6Chen J.-H. Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The fact that interconversion of ecdysone and 3DE by prothoracic glands was not detectable suggested that 3DE is more likely an independent product of pathways of ecdysteroid biosynthesis in the glands. After secretion from the prothoracic glands, the 3DE is reduced to ecdysone by an NAD(P)H-linked 3DE 3β-reductase in the hemolymph (3Sakurai S. Warren J.T. Gilbert L.I. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1989; 10: 179-197Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar,4Kiriishi S. Rountree D.B. Sakurai S. Gilbert L.I. Experientia (Basel). 1990; 46: 57-64Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 6Chen J.-H.

Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany1989: 188-196Google Scholar). Ecdysone undergoes C-20 hydroxylation in certain peripheral tissues yielding 20-hydroxyecdysone, which is considered to be the true molting hormone in most insects (8Rees H.H. Eur. J. Entomol. 1995; 92: 9-39Google Scholar). Thus, 3DE 3β-reductase-catalyzed reduction of 3DE to ecdysone is viewed as an important regulatory step in the production of the molting hormone in Lepidopteran species. 3DE 3β-reductase was demonstrated in the hemolymph and the activity of the enzyme during the last larval instar reached a peak just preceding that of the hemolymph ecdysteroid titer, supporting a role of the enzyme in production of ecdysteroids. It was revealed that the enzyme exhibited maximum activity at low 3DE substrate concentrations, with a drastic inhibition of activity at higher concentrations (>5 μm), suggesting the existence of an inhibition site for 3DE (6Chen J.-H. Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 3β-reductase enzyme was purified from the hemolymph and was shown to be a monomer with molecular mass of approximately 36 kDa (6Chen J.-H. Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of the NH2 terminus as well as of interior tryptic peptides of the purified enzyme have been determined. Here, we report the molecular cloning and characterization of the cDNA encoding 3DE 3β-reductase of the cotton leafworm, S. littoralis. Conceptual translation and amino acid sequence analysis indicates that 3DE 3β-reductase is closely related to those of the third superfamily of oxidoreductases. 3DE 3β-reductase from hemolymph of S. littoralis was purified to homogeneity using a combination of polyethylene glycol 6000 precipitation and successive FPLC fractionation on Mono Q, phenyl Superose (twice), and hydroxyapatite columns, as described previously (6Chen J.-H. Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% gels, electrotransferred to ProBlottTM membrane, and visualized by Coomassie staining (9Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single band was observed, excised and sequenced by an automated pulsed liquid-phase sequencer (Applied Biosystems 471A). The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence thus determined was as follows, ATIDVPMLKMLNDREMPAIALGTYLGFDKG. To obtain sequences of the interior region of the enzyme, the purified protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above, visualized by Coomassie staining, and the corresponding band was excised and cleaved with trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and sequenced. The sequences of four of the resulting peptides were determined. These peptides had the following sequences: peptide 1, HFDTAAIYNTEAEVGEAIR; peptide 2, FGMDLPGPK; peptide 3, LKEEEIEK; peptide 4, INQFNSNTR. A PCR-based cloning strategy was used to clone a cDNA fragment encoding the region between the NH2 terminus and an internal peptide sequenced as described above. Three degenerate primers were synthesized. Primer N was designed on the basis of a part of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence (5′-GCGAATTCYTNAAYGAYMGNGARATGCC, where Y represents T/C, R is A/G, M is A/C, N is A/T/C/G); reverse primers A and B were made according to the sequences of peptide 1 and peptide 2 (primer A, 5′-CAGGATCCACYTCNGCYTCNGTRTTRTA; primer B, 5′-ATGGATCCCCNGGNARRTCCATNCCRAA). An EcoRI restriction site was built into primer N and a BamHI site into primer A and primer B for use in cloning; these are underlined in the primer sequences. Since the site of synthesis of the reductase enzyme was unknown, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Life Technologies, Inc.) from total insect tissues (including hemolymph, but with the cuticle, head, and gut contents removed) dissected from larvae 90 h into the last larval instar. mRNA from total RNA was isolated using Dynabeads mRNA Purification Kit (Dynal) (UK) Ltd. First strand cDNA was reverse transcribed from the mRNA using a 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit from Boehringer Mannheim with either random primer p(dN)6 supplied with the kit or QTadapter primer, 5′-CCATCAGTGCTAGACAGCTAAGCTTGAGCTCGGATCC(T)17 (modified from Ref. 10Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). cDNA synthesized with random primer served as template for the PCR in which the above degenerate primers were used. PCR reactions were carried out as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 4 min and 4 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 37 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2 min; followed by 31 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2 min. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. This revealed that PCR with primer N and primer B yielded a product of approximately 660 bp, while PCR with primer N and primer A yielded two products of approximately 380 and 180 bp, respectively. The 660-bp PCR product was gel-purified using HybaidTM DNA Purification Kit (Hybaid) and used as a template along with primer N and primer A in a second PCR reaction using the same cycling conditions as described above. This second PCR only yielded the 180-bp product, implying that peptide 1 is located in between the NH2 terminus and peptide 2. PCR products were purified, digested with EcoRI andBamHI, and subsequently cloned intoEcoRI/BamHI-digested pBluescript vector. Transformants were screened by colony PCR using primers T3 and T7 (5′-ATTAACCCTCACTAAAG and 5′-AATACGACTCACTATAG, respectively), and those showing the correct size of inserts were propagated in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and plasmid DNA was purified after 16 h incubation at 37 °C. Double-stranded DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxy termination method using Sequenase Version 2.0 (USBTM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 5′- and 3′-RACE were carried out to obtain the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA. A 5′-RACE System (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used to amplify the 5′ terminus of the message for sequencing. Briefly, a gene-specific primer 5′-1 (5′-TTCAGCCTCCGTGTTGTAG) was hybridized to the mRNA prepared as described above and cDNA was synthesized using Superscript II reverse transcriptase. The RNA was then degraded with RNase mix (RNase H and RNase T1), and the cDNA was purified by GlassMax spin cartridge supplied with the kit. A poly(dC) tail was added to the 3′ terminus of the purified cDNA using dCTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and the cDNA region corresponding to the 5′-end of the mRNA was amplified by two successive rounds of PCR using additional gene-specific primers 5′-2 and 5′-3 (5′-TCGAATTCGTGTCTGTACCCGAGGTC and 5′-GCGAATTCTTGCATCACTACATTGCG, respectively, which incorporated an EcoRI site (underlined)), together with the anchor primers supplied by the manufacturer. The second round of PCR yielded a single amplified product of approximately 240 bp. To amplify the 3′-end, another two gene-specific primers C1 and C2 (5′-GAAGACCTGATCACGTACG and 5′-GCGAATTCAGGCACCATTGTCATGGGC, respectively, incorporating an EcoRI site (underlined)) in combination with the adapter primers Q0 and Q1 (5′-CCATCAGTGCTAGACAGCT and 5′-TAAGCTTGAGCTCGGATCC, respectively, modified from Ref. 10Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) were used for the PCR in which QT primed cDNA served as template (see earlier). The nested PCR with primers C2 and Q1 yielded a product of approximately 750 bp. The 5′- and 3′-RACE products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, cloned into pBluescript vector, and sequenced across both strands. The DNA sequence containing the entire open reading frame and 3′-noncoding region was amplified by PCR from the cDNA synthesized with primer QT as described above using the following gene-specific primers: β-5′ (5′-GCGAATTCATGTTTCGCGCCAGTTTT) and β-3′ (5′-CGGGATCCTGCAGAGATTGATTTCACATATT). These primers were designed to incorporate EcoRI, and BamHI andPstI sites (underlined in the primer sequences) into the 5′- and 3′-ends of the sense strand, respectively. PCR was conducted as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 4 min, and 4 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 37 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2.5 min, followed by 31 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 2.5 min. The resulting PCR product was gel-purified, digested withEcoRI and PstI, ligated into pBluescript vector that had been previously digested with EcoRI andPstI, transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α, selected, and sequenced. The sequence of three independent cDNA clones were compared to detect errors that could have occurred during the reverse-transcription and the PCR amplification. Total RNA from various tissues or whole animals with the gut content removed was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 10 μg of RNA was fractionated on a formaldehyde/agarose gel, transferred to Electran® nylon membrane (BDH), and hybridized with a probe corresponding to the open reading frame and 3′-noncoding region of the 3β-reductase cDNA. Probes were radiolabeled by random priming (Boehringer Mannheim), and loading was normalized by probing with a PstI fragment of the A3 actin gene from B. mori (a gift from Dr. A. Mange, Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1) (11Mounier N. Prudhomme J.C. Insect Biochem. 1991; 21: 523-533Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and an 18 S rRNA fragment from mouse (a gift from Ms Yi-Ping Bao, Liverpool University). Blot signals were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Total genomic DNA was prepared from whole animals using Qiagen Genomic-Tip 500/G (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's recommendations. 10-μg aliquots of DNA were digested withEcoRI, SalI, HindIII,PvuII, NcoI as well as EcoRI +SalI, fractionated on a 1% agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized using radiolabeled probes corresponding to different regions of the 3β-reductase cDNA. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out using QuikHyb (Stratagene) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The blots were washed at high stringency (0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) and labeled bands visualized by autoradiography. Polyclonal antibodies against 3DE 3β-reductase were raised in chickens using the purified protein as antigen. The purified protein was first resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel, visualized with 0.25 m KCl. The resulting white band was cut out, extracted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and used as antigen. About 50 μg of the antigen was emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected into a chicken. Booster injections were made 12 and 20 days later with 100 μg of the antigen. Extraction of antibodies from the yolk of the immunized chicken eggs with polyethylene glycol was carried out following the procedures described by Gassmann et al. (12Gassmann M. Thömms P. Weiser T. Hübscher U. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Western blotting was carried out essentially as described previously (13Chen J.-H. Hara T. Fisher M.J. Rees H.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, hemolymph samples taken at various times during the last larval instar were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel in accordance with the method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell) (15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed with the antibodies at a final dilution of 1:500. Blots were developed by incubation with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-chicken IgG at a final dilution of 1:3000, followed by incubation in 15 ml of alkaline phosphatase color-development buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.8) to which was added 150 μl each of Bio-Rad AP color reagents A and B. Immunoreactive protein was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics densitometer. Using a combination of polyethylene glycol 6000 precipitation and column chromatography on Mono Q, phenyl Superose, and hydroxyapatite, we purified 3DE 3β-reductase to homogeneity from Spodopterahemolymph. A silver-stained SDS gel revealed that the purified 3DE 3β-reductase consisted of a single protein band of apparent molecular mass 36 kDa (see Fig. 4. in Ref 6Chen J.-H. Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). NH2-terminal and tryptic peptide amino acid sequences were obtained from this 36-kDa protein as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” At the time when these sequence data were obtained, data base searches using FASTA revealed that these sequences were novel. A PCR-based cloning strategy, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” allowed us to obtain a clone corresponding to the sequence between nucleotides 142–785 in Fig.1. Gene-specific primers derived from this sequence were synthesized and used for 5′- and 3′-RACE to obtain the 5′- and 3′-ends of the clone. 5′-RACE produced, homogeneously, a cDNA clone of 237 bp that contains two putative translation start sites at nucleotides 23–25 and 68–70, respectively. On the other hand, 3′-RACE resulted in heterogeneous cDNA clones. Sequencing experiments revealed that this resulted from multiple polyadenylation signals (AATAAA) occurring in the 3′-noncoding region which directs a poly(A) tail to be added to different sites. The longest cDNA clone obtained with 3′-RACE was 746 bp in length and contained a stop codon and three putative polyadenylation signals. Taken together, all the overlapping cDNAs span a total of 1425 bp. This sequence was further confirmed by sequencing of a cDNA clone, which was constructed to contain the open reading frame and 3′-noncoding region, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 1, using the first ATG as the start codon, the full-length 3DE 3β-reductase cDNA encodes a protein of 345 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 39,591. The predicted molecular weight of mature protein is 37,689, which is similar to its apparentM r observed in our SDS-PAGE analysis. The protein is mildly acidic with an estimated pI of 6.23. The deduced amino acid sequence for the cDNA coding region was compared with all sequences in the data base Swiss-Prot using FASTA in the GCG package. The cDNA gene product was found to be most similar to proteins which belong to the third superfamily of oxidoreductases. 3DE 3β-reductase particularly resembles mammalian aldose reductases. Among the 20 proteins most closely matched, six are mammalian aldose reductases, others include a mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase, a probable mammalian trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase, two mammalian aldose reductase-related proteins, an amphibian lens protein, a putative reductase from Leishmania, a mammalian 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a mammalian chlordecone reductase, a mammalian trans-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase, a yeast xylose reductase, a mammalian 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase, a plantd-sorbitol-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a hypothetical 37.1-kDa protein in hxt5-cdc12 intergenic region from yeast and a plant 6-deoxychalcone synthase. The amino acid similarity extends across the entire length of the proteins compared. Fig.2 shows the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of mature 3DE 3β-reductase to some proteins corresponding to different subgroups of the third superfamily of oxidoreductases. It demonstrates that there is 42.1, 41.3, 39.2, 37.6, and 35.4% identity, respectively, between 3DE 3β-reductase and human alcohol dehydrogenase, rabbit aldose reductase, rat 3-oxo-5-β-steroid 4-dehydrogenase, rat 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and frog crystallin. As demonstrated in Fig.3 A, a cDNA probe representing the protein coding and 3′-noncoding regions of 3DE 3β-reductase detected a major transcript of approximately 1.4 kilobases in a variety of tissues prepared from larvae 78 h into the last larval instar. The size of this major transcript is consistent with that of the cDNA obtained. The highest expression of 3DE 3β-reductase is detected in Malpighian tubules, followed by midgut and fat body, with low levels expressed in hemocyte. No detectable expression was found in the central nervous system (data not shown). Less expression is detected in Malpighian tubules and hemocytes dissected at 46 h into the last larval instar, but no expression was found in all four tissues from early instar larvae. It is noticeable that RNAs at approximately 2.6 and 3.6 kb are also recognized in fat body by this probe but at lower intensity (Fig.3 A). It remains to be determined whether these larger RNAs represent pre-mRNAs for 3DE 3β-reductase or other mRNAs with significant sequence similarity to 3β-reductase, although the former seems most probable due to the high stringency used. The signals detected by the actin probe used for normalization are substantially lower in the fat body than those in other tissues (Fig. 3 B). rRNA probe was therefore used to further verify the equal loading (Fig.3 C). Some apparent degradation of rRNA is observed in midgut, Malpighian tubules, and hemocytes, which may be due to the fact that 28 S ribosomal RNA in insects frequently occurs as two equal-sized fragments due to RNase activity within certain cells (16Wang X.-P. Hobbs A.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 1001-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This activity seems least in the fat body and the total amount of hybridization to the rRNA probe seems comparable with the other samples. Northern analysis of total RNA isolated from whole animals from different developmental stages of the last larval instar revealed that the 3DE 3β-reductase mRNA is only expressed in the second half of the instar (Fig. 4). The mRNA starts to be detected at 66 h into the last larval instar and increases in intensity, as normalized to actin and rRNA, to 90 h with an apparent decrease at 96 h before increasing to its highest levels observed at 114 h. Genomic DNA was prepared from whole animals and digested with various restriction enzymes, of which SalI, HindIII, andNcoI sites are found in the 3β-reductase cDNA, whereasEcoRI and PvuII sites are not found in the cDNA. The resultant DNA fragments were analyzed by Southern blot using probes representing different regions of the cDNA. As shown in Fig. 5 A, usually two bands were observed in all of the digested samples, when the blot was subjected to hybridization with a probe representing the coding and 3′-noncoding regions of the 3β-reductase cDNA. However, when the same blot was re-probed with a cDNA fragment that corresponded to the NH2-terminal region to the first HindIII site in the cDNA, essentially only one band was detected except for the restriction digestion with PvuII, where two bands were observed (Fig. 5 B). Again, a probe that represents the region from the SalI site to the poly(A) site detected only one band in each case (Fig. 5 C). The analysis displayed in Fig. 5 is most simply interpreted if the 3β-reductase is encoded by a single copy gene in the Spodoptera genome and if this gene has at least one intron that contains EcoRI,PvuII, and SalI sites. Using a reverse transcription-PCR-based cloning strategy, employing degenerate primers designed on the basis of the partial amino acid sequences of fragments of 3DE 3β-reductase, together with 3′- and 5′-RACE, the complete cDNA encoding the enzyme was isolated and sequenced. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA contained the NH2-terminal sequence of the enzyme as well as the four internal peptides obtained from tryptic digestion of the band corresponding to the M r 36,000 polypeptide, confirming that we had cloned the 3DE 3β-reductase cDNA. The presence of 3DE 3β-reductase enzyme in hemolymph is due to secretion from tissues that synthesize it. The first 17 predicted amino acids appear to constitute a signal peptide, since the sequence shares significant characteristics with the signal sequences of some eukaryotic secretory proteins (17Nunnari J. Walter P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar): (i) the 17 amino acids are within the typical range of 13–36 residues of signal peptides; (ii) a positively charged residue, arginine, is found in the amino-terminal part of the signal; (iii) it contains a highly hydrophobic stretch of 11 residues; (iv) a serine residue at the end of the signal has a small neutral side chain that is recognized by signal peptidase for cleavage. Three putative polyadenylation signals were found in the 3′-noncoding region of the cDNA, suggesting alternative polyadenylation sites may exist, as the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor may bind to any one of these three sequences (18Wahle E. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 247-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Indeed, during sequencing following 3′-RACE, we found that one cDNA clone showed a shorter 3′-noncoding region, with the poly(A) tail attaching 14 nucleotides downstream of the second AATAAA sequence (Fig. 1). Furthermore, three ATTTA sequences were found in the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the 3β-reductase cDNA, all located in between the second and the third polyadenylation signals, with two occurring in the sequence which is missing in the shorter 3β-reductase cDNA (Fig. 1). In fact, the 3′-untranslated region has been increasingly recognized as one of the important sequences which may contain distinct elements involved in regulating mRNA degradation (19Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). A most well studied example is the AU-rich element (ARE) found on many unstable mRNAs. The sequence consensus for the AREs is loosely defined as AUUUA repeated once or several times within the 3′-UTR. This pentanucleotide is often found within an AU-rich region of the mRNA. It seems to be clear that (i) both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins can specifically bind to the ARE, (ii) the binding activity of some of those proteins appears to increase or decrease in response to the changes in cellular metabolism that lead to alterations in the stability of ARE-containing mRNA, and (iii) ARE activity can be mediated by a complex of proteins as in the case of a 20 S complex (19Sachs A.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). We were interested in addressing the question as to whether the alternative polyadenylation, using AATAAA signals at different locations in the 3β-reductase cDNA, is related to the regulation of mRNA stability and what the role of the AREs in the 3′ UTR is likely to be. For this, total RNA from fat body, midgut, and Malpighian tubules from 78 h last larval instar larvae was subjected to Northern analysis using probes corresponding, respectively, to nucleotides 1072–1176, 1177–1281, and 1282–1386 of the cDNA (see Fig. 1). Because all three probes gave identical signals, the AREs in the 3′-UTR do not seem to contribute to the regulation of the mRNA stability in the tissues examined (data not shown). It has long been recognized that oxidoreductases, dependent upon nicotinamide coenzymes, can be divided into two extended superfamilies, according to their structural type and catalytic mechanism (20Jörnvall H. Persson M. Jeffery J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4226-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The enzymes of one superfamily contain catalytically important zinc, many utilizing primary alcohols as substrates, though use of secondary alcohols and other activities are also noticed (21Horjales E. Brändén C.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15445-15451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jeffery J. Jörnvall H. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 47-106PubMed Google Scholar, 23Aronson B.D. Somerville R.L. Epperly B.R. Dekker E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5226-5232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Koivusalo M. Baumann M. Uotila L. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). A structurally noteworthy feature of these proteins is the highly conserved cysteine residues, involved in zinc binding, scattered within the first half of the amino acid sequences. Enzymes of the other superfamily generally do not contain any catalytically active metal atom, have shorter subunits, and frequently but not always use large secondary alcohols as substrates (25Eklund H. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1989; 17: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Eklund H. Horjales E. Jörnvall H. Brändén C.-I. Jeffery J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8005-8012Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 27Persson B. Krook M. Jörnvall H. Eur. J.

A. 1991; 88: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recently, a third superfamily has been proposed (29Bohren K.M. Bullock B. Wermuth B. Gabbay K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9547-9551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Bruce N.C. Willey D.L. Coulson A.F.W. Jeffery J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Enzymes of this superfamily are not homologous to those of the two superfamilies mentioned above and their polypeptide chain lengths generally lie between those of the two superfamilies. They contain no metal atom and their substrates include primary and secondary alcohols. Sequence data base searching revealed that the predicted amino acid sequence of 3DE 3β-reductase is most similar to the proteins that belong to the third superfamily of oxidoreductases (30Bruce N.C. Willey D.L. Coulson A.F.W. Jeffery J. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The existence of only one cysteine residue (in position 192, see Fig. 1) in the predicted amino acid sequence of the mature protein indicated that the 3β-reductase of S. littoralis contains no zinc. Motif searching (MOTIF at http://www.motif.genome.ad.jp/) with the predicted amino acid sequence of 3β-reductase uncovered the three consensus patterns present in aldo/keto reductases (residues 68–85, 163–180, 277–292, Fig. 1), which are specific to this family of proteins. In addition, its molecular weight (37,689/subunit) is in the same range as found for these proteins. Hence, we conclude that 3DE 3β-reductase is a new member of the third superfamily of oxidoreductases. Northern analysis has revealed that the mRNA for 3β-reductase has a wide tissue distribution with considerable variability in the abundance of the mRNA among the tissues examined. It is not clear at present which tissue is the major source for the 3β-reductase activity in the hemolymph or whether all the tissues containing 3β-reductase mRNA contribute to the enzyme activity in hemolymph. The cytosolic enzymes reversibly interconverting ecdysone and 3DE (ecdysone oxidase and 3DE 3β-reductase) have been reported to be widely distributed, even in tissues that do not reduce 3DE to 3-epiecdysone (31Lafont R. Koolman J. Hoffmann J. Porchet M. Biosynthesis, Metabolism and Mode of Action of Invertebrate Hormones. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1984: 196-226Crossref Google Scholar, 32Gelman D.B. DeMilo A.B. Thyagaraja B.S. Kelly T.J. Masler E.P. Bell R.A. Borkovec A.B. Arch. Insect Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 17: 93-106Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). If such tissue 3DE 3β-reductase is closely related to the hemolymph 3β-reductase, the wide distribution of transcripts in the Northern blots could be explained by hybridization of the probe to mRNA corresponding to such tissue 3β-reductase. Sakurai and co-workers (33Nomura Y. Komatsuzaki M. Iwai M. Sakurai S. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 249-257Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) examined the tissue distribution of the 3β-reductase in B. mori at the protein level, as well as the level of enzyme activity, and they too found a wide tissue distribution. The absence of the 3β-reductase protein in central nervous system in B. mori is consistent with our observation that 3β-reductase mRNA is not detectable in that tissue fromS. littoralis. However, the fact that Malpighian tubules and midgut from B. mori do not contain detectable enzyme protein seems to be surprising, since we found that the mRNA for 3β-reductase is abundantly transcribed in these tissues from S. littoralis. Preliminary results of Western blotting with tissues dissected from S. littoralis at 90 h into the last instar revealed a similar distribution pattern as that of B. mori, with 3β-reductase being detected in hemolymph as well as hemocytes, but little in midgut and none in Malpighian tubules (data not shown). It seems, therefore, that although the mRNA is abundantly transcribed in Malpighian tubules and midgut, none or only little is translated into the protein in these tissues. This observation may indicate that selective translation of mRNA is indeed an important step in regulation of expression of the gene encoding 3DE 3β-reductase. Northern analysis also revealed that the mRNA for the enzyme is only expressed in the second half of the last larval instar. The mRNA starts to be detected 48–66 h into the last larval instar, at which time the actual enzyme activity is just about to appear (6Chen J.-H. Webb T.J. Powls R. Rees H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The increase in expression can be seen from 72 to 90 h, which coincides well with the sharp rise in the enzyme activity. The small decline in the expression between 90 and 96 h is also coincident with the decrease in the enzyme activity at this time. The second increase in the mRNA level observed between 102 to 114 h is presumably responsible for the small rise in the enzyme activity at the end of the instar. It appears evident, therefore, that the change in the activity of 3β-reductase is, at least in part, regulated by gene expression at the transcriptional level, although, as mentioned above, post-transcriptional regulation may also be as important in the expression of 3DE 3β-reductase in certain tissues. Southern analysis suggest that 3β-reductase is encoded by a single copy gene in the genome of S. littoralis. Although the details of the organization of the gene are far from clear, it is predicted from the results of Southern analysis that the gene encoding 3β-reductase has at least one intron that contains EcoRI,SalI, and PvuII sites. It remains to be determined whether the existence of two larger RNAs detected in fat body by a probe representing the entire coding region and 3′-noncoding region of the cDNA is due to the possible occurrence of intermediates in the process of mRNA splicing. The availability of the cDNA clones encoding 3DE 3β-reductase should facilitate studies of genomic organization, regulation of expression of the gene, structure-function relationships of the enzyme, and its involvement in regulation of the production of ecdysteroids.

In the present study, His6-tagged E1 α2β2 tetramers (171 kDa) denatured in 8 m urea were competently reconstituted in vitro at 23 °C with an absolute requirement for chaperonins GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP. Unexpectedly, the kinetics for the recovery of E1 activity was very slow with a rate constant of 290 m−1 s−1. Renaturation of E1 with a similarly slow kinetics was also achieved using individual GroEL-α and GroEL-β complexes as combined substrates. However, the β subunit was markedly more prone to misfolding than the α in the absence of GroEL. The α subunit was released as soluble monomers from the GroEL-α complex alone in the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP. In contrast, the β subunit discharged from the GroEL-β complex readily rebound to GroEL when the α subunit was absent. Analysis of the assembly state showed that the His6-α and β subunits released from corresponding GroEL-polypeptide complexes assembled into a highly structured but inactive 85.5-kDa αβ dimeric intermediate, which subsequently dimerized to produce the active α2β2tetrameter. The purified αβ dimer isolated from Escherichia coli lysates was capable of binding to GroEL to produce a stable GroEL-αβ ternary complex. Incubation of this novel ternary complex with GroES and Mg-ATP resulted in recovery of E1 activity, which also followed slow kinetics with a rate constant of 138m−1 s−1.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 321-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The family of molecular chaperones is large and consists primarily of heat shock proteins (Hsp).1 Among them, group I chaperonins include GroEL/GroES in bacteria, Hsp60/Hsp10 in eukaryotic mitochondria, and RUBISCO-binding protein/Cpn21 in the chloroplasts of higher plants (4Kim S. Willison K.R. Horwich A.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 543-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This subset of molecular chaperones are highly conserved and, for the most part, functionally interchangeable (5Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Seetharam R. Gupta R.S. Oppenheim J. Thomas J.O. Cowan N.J.

GroEL is a double-ring complex with the two heptameric rings stacked upon one another back to back. Each 57-kDa GroEL monomer contains an apical domain, an intermediate domain, and an equatorial domain. The diameter of the opening in the apical domain is 45 Å, which allows the passage of unfolded and partially folded substrate polypeptides (6Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). The GroES structure is a single heptameric ring consisting of 10-kDa monomers, with a side view showing a dome-like structure of 30 Å in height and 75 Å in width (7Hunt J.F. Weaver A.J. Landry S.J. Gierasch L. Deisenhofer J. Nature. 1996; 379: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). At the base of the GroES structure are mobile loops that provide contact with the apical domains of GroEL. Recently, the crystal structure of the GroEL14-GroES7-ADP7 complex has been determined (9Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The complex structure shows that the binding of GroES to one end of GroEL causes an en bloc domain movement within the complex, resulting in doubling of the volume in thecis ring cavity of GroEL. It is estimated that the enlarged GroEL cavity when capped by GroES can accommodate substrate polypeptides of up to 70 kDa in size (9Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The asymmetric GroEL14-GroES7 complex with only one end of the GroEL double-ring complex capped by GroES has the appearance of a “bullet” under the electron microscope (10Schmidt M. Rutkat K. Rachel R. Pfeifer G. Jaenicke R. Viitanen P. Lorimer G. Buchner J. Science. 1994; 265: 656-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the asymmetric GroEL-GroES complex is the functional hetero-oligomer that promotes protein folding reactions (11Langer T. Pfeifer G. Martin J. Baumeister W. Hartl F.U. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4757-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar,12Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Unfolded polypeptides enter the uncapped ring through its open apical domain, and folding is thought to occur, following GroES binding, in this cis ring. However, under certain conditions, for example, the presence of high Mg-ATP and high salt concentrations, both ends of the GroEL double-ring complex can be capped by GroES to produce a symmetric GroEL14-(GroES7)2 complex, which has the shape of a “football” when examined by electron microscopy (10Schmidt M.

Science. 1994; 265: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of the symmetric complex is still a matter of debate, there is evidence to suggest that this species represents an intermediate in the protein folding cycle (12Weissman J.S.

During the cycle, it is believed that only one of the two GroEL cavities or rings accommodates the unfolded polypeptide. However, recent electron micrograph data indicate that both cavities of GroEL harbor unfolded polypeptides (15Llorca O. Marco S. Carrascosa J.L. Valpuesta J.M.

A. 1997; 94: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Correlations of the symmetric GroEL14-(GroES7)2 complex with the protein folding activity of chaperonins have been shown (16Sparrer H. Rutkat K. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17Azem A. Diamant S. Kessel M. Weiss C. Goloubinoff P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12021-12025Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of chaperoning action for this putative symmetric hetero-oligomer is not clear. Despite the advances described above, only limited information is available concerning the role of chaperones during the assembly of oligomeric proteins. Earlier studies with mitochondrial ornithine transcarboxylase (18Zheng X. Rosenberg L.E. Kalousek F. Fenton W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7489-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), glutamate synthetase (19Fisher M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13777-13779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and malate dehydrogenase (20Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) suggest that chaperonins GroEL and GroES mediate the folding of assembly competent monomers, followed by spontaneous assembly of monomers into active homo-oligomers. In the case of heterodimeric proteins, for example, the native αβ dimer of bacterial luciferase, a prevailing model is that GroEL binds separately to the folding intermediate of either subunit and the folded α and β subunits released in the presence of GroES and Mg-ATP assemble to form the active enzyme (21Flynn G.C. Beckers C.J. Baase W.A. Dahlquist F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10826-10830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it was shown that GroEL/GroES modulate the kinetic partitioning of the β subunit intermediate of bacterial luciferase between two alternate pathways to increase the yield of native αβ dimers (22Fedorov A.V. Baldwin T.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 712-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As forBacillus pyruvate dehydrogenase, the α and β subunits individually expressed in Escherichia coli, when incubatedin vitro, spontaneously assemble into the native α2β2 structure (23Lessard I.A. Perham R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10378-10383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are interested in understanding the chaperonin-mediated biogenesis of mitochondrial macromolecular structures using the human branched chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex as a model system. The mitochondrial BCKD complex (∼5 × 103 kDa) is organized around a cubic core comprising 24 dihydrolipoyl acyltransferase (E2), to which branched chain α-ketoacid decarboxylase (E1), dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3), a specific kinase, and a specific phosphatase are attached through ionic interactions (24Reed L.J. Damuni Z. Merryfield M.L. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1985; 27: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We reported earlier that GroEL/GroES are essential for in vitro reconstitution of the 24-meric inner core of the E2 component (25Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Zhi W. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8962-8968Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The E1 component is a thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent enzyme, which consists of two 45.5-kDa α subunits and two 37.8-kDa β subunits. We have shown previously that co-transformation of GroEL/GroES into E. coli expressing mammalian E1 subunits resulted in an over 500-fold increase in the yield of the active E1 α2β2 tetramer, compared with the single transformant without overexpression of chaperonins (26Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12400-12403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16601-16606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise steps in chaperonin-mediated assembly pathway of E1 remain to be elucidated. In this paper, we report in vitro reconstitution of urea-denatured human E1, which shows an absolute requirement for GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP. Surprisingly, the kinetics of E1 reconstitution is markedly slower than that of other proteins, for example, mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase refolded under similar conditions. Moreover, a novel ternary complex resulting from the interaction of GroEL with a large (85.5 kDa) αβ dimeric intermediate during assembly is described. We show that the chaperonin-dependent conversion of inactive dimers to active tetramers is a slow step in E1 assembly. These findings provide evidence for an obligatory role of chaperonins in priming the assembly intermediate for subsequent higher order oligomerization. E. coli CG-712 cells (an ESts strain) and the pGroESL plasmid overexpressing GroEL and GroES were kind gifts of Drs. George Lorimer and Anthony Gatenby of the DuPont Experimental Station (Wilmington, DE). The pTrcHisB expression vector was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The pHisT-hE1 plasmid for co-expression of His6-α and untagged β subunits of human E1 was described previously (28Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The His6-α subunit contained a His6 tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavable linker fused to the N terminus of the α subunit. The pGroESL plasmid was transformed into ESts CG-712 cells, which were grown at 37 °C under chloramphenicol selection toA 600 of 0.6. The expression of GroEL and GroES was induced by IPTG overnight at 37 °C. Cell lysates were prepared by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm benzamidine as described previously (28Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GroEL was purified from the lysates according to the method described by Clark et al. (29Clark A.C. Hugo E. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5893-5901Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) that included a critical Reactive Red column step with the following modifications. Prior to DEAE-Sepharose column fractionation, the protein sample was treated with 10 mm Mg-ATP at 37 °C for 2 h. The collected GroEL fractions from the ion exchange column were concentrated and treated with 10 mm Mg-ATP again at 37 °C for 2 h, followed by purification on Sephacryl S-400HP column with Mg-ATP omitted from the column buffer. Eluted GroEL fractions were pooled, concentrated, and purified on a Reactive Red column. In a concurrent purification scheme, fractions from the above DEAE-Sepharose column containing GroES were pooled, and GroES was further purified on a phenyl-Sepharose column as described previously (30Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Concentrations of GroEL and GroES were determined spectrophotometrically using published extinction coefficients of 1.22 × 104m−1cm−1 (30Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 138-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and 1.2 × 103m−1 cm−1 (31Fisher M.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), respectively. CG-712 cells co-transformed with pGroESL and pHisT-hE1 plasmids were grown in YTGK (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring, NY1989: A3Google Scholar) medium. Expression of His6-α and untagged β subunits and GroEL/GroES was induced by IPTG. Assembled human His6-E1 was isolated from cell lysates and purified by Ni-NTA (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) column chromatography as described previously (28Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To remove the His6 tag, the purified fusion human E1 was digested with the tobacco etch virus protease at 4 °C overnight. The released His6 tag was removed by Ni-NTA extraction. Purified His 6-tagged or untagged human E1 was denatured for 1 h at 23 °C in a denaturing buffer containing 8 murea, 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final E1 tetramer concentration of 12.5 μm. Denatured E1 was quickly diluted 100-fold on a Vortex mixer into a refolding buffer consisting of 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 2 mm TPP, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with or without 2 μm GroEL (14-mers) and 4 μm GroES (7-mers). The refolding reaction was initiated by addition of Mg-ATP to a final concentration of 10 mm. The reaction mixture was incubated at 23 °C for up to 30 h. At indicated times, aliquots were taken to which CDTA was added to a final concentration of 25 mm to discontinue the folding reaction. Samples were kept at −20 °C until analysis. As a control, purified human E1 without urea treatment was incubated in the refolding buffer under the same conditions. For samples to be extracted with Ni-NTA resin, 1 mm DTT was replaced with 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the refolding buffer. The assay mixture contained 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm NAD+, 2 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm CoA, 0.2 mm TPP, 0.1% Triton X-100, 7 nm in vitro lipoylated recombinant bovine E2, and 0.4 μmrecombinant human E3. To 0.3 ml of the assay mixture, 20 μl of the aliquot from the refolding reaction was added. The enzyme reaction of the BCKD complex was initiated by addition of 10 μl of 6.4 mm (final concentration, 0.2 mm) α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate (specific radioactivity, 1500–1800 cpm/nmol). After incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, the reaction was quenched by addition to a final concentration of 6% trichloroacetic acid. Released radiolabeled CO2 was trapped in a paper wick soaked with 1 n NaOH and measured in a Beckman scintillation counter. The assay was linear for up to 1 μg of the purified human E1 protein. The rate of decarboxylation with α-keto[1-14C] isovalerate as substrate by E1 in the reconstituted BCKD system was 15-fold higher than that by E1 alone (33Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 166: 146-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Assay components in the BCKD system had no measurable effects on E1 renaturation (data not shown). His6-tagged human E1 was denatured in the above denaturing buffer containing 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The His6-α subunit was extracted with Ni-NTA resin pre-equilibrated in the same denaturing buffer. The untagged β subunit remained in the supernatant. The His6-α subunit was eluted from Ni-NTA resin with 250 mm imidazole in the denaturing buffer. Separated individual subunits were concentrated in Centricon-30 concentrators and rapidly diluted into the refolding buffer containing various stoichiometric amounts of GroEL. The GroEL-polypeptide complexes were purified on a 10–30% sucrose density gradient in Beckman SW41 rotor at 210,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions containing the GroEL-His6-α or the GroEL-β complex were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −80 °C. The stoichiometries of GroEL-polypeptide complexes were determined by densitometry scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. GroEL, His6-α, and untagged β monomers that were used as standards and run on the same gel were linear up to 30, 5.5, and 4.5 μg, respectively. The amount of sample to be determined was adjusted to be within the linear range. CG-712 cells co-transformed with pHisT-hE1 and pGroESL plasmids were grown at 37 °C in the C2 broth minimal medium and induced for expression of E1 subunits with IPTG for 3 h. The C2 broth minimal medium was modified from the C broth medium with low sulfate and amino acid contents as described previously (34Guzman-Verduzco L.M. Kupersztoch Y.M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 5201-5208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The growth medium in the present study contained per liter: 2 g of NH4Cl, 6 g of Na2HPO4·7H2O, 3 g of KH2PO4, 3 g of NaCl, 6 g of yeast extract, 40 μm TPP, 50 mg of carbenicillin, and 50 mg of chloramphenicol. Lysates prepared from harvested cells were extracted with Ni-NTA resin and washed with a lysis buffer containing 15 mm imidazole (28Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13110-13118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. Eluted fractions containing the αβ dimer and the α2β2tetramer were concentrated by centrifugation in Millipore Ultra free-15 filter concentrators. Proteins were separated on a 10–25% sucrose density gradient spun at 210,000 × g for 18 h. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assayed for E1 activity. Fractions that contained the αβ dimers were combined and further purified by FPLC on a HiLoad Superdex 200 column (2.6 × 60 cm). An assumption was that the recovery of E1 activity represented the formation of the tetramer. During folding, activity of nondenatured E1 incubated under the same conditions served as 100% control. At a given time point, the percentage of E1 activity recovered relative to the control was converted to active α2β2tetramers formed, based on the initial concentration of tetramers in the control. The concentration of tetramers formed was used to calculate the concentrations of remaining monomers (α or β) or dimers (αβ). Data were fit to the second order rate equation:kt = 1/[A] − 1/[A]0, wherek = the second order rate constant, t = reaction time (s), [A] = the concentration (m) of remaining monomers or dimers at a given time and [A]0 = the initial concentration (m) of monomers or dimers. Recombinant His6-tagged E1 was denatured in a buffer containing 8 m urea. The denatured E1 tetramer was rapidly diluted 100-fold into a refolding buffer containing a 4-fold and 8-fold molar excess of GroEL and GroES, respectively, and 1 mm DTT. Fig. 1 shows that the time course for the recovery of E1 activity follows strikingly slow kinetics during the 30-h incubation at 23 °C with a second order rate constant of 290 m−1 s−1. With the same GroEL/GroES preparations, refolding of urea-denatured mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase reached a plateau of 80% recovered activity in 40 min with a second order rate constant of 1.2 × 104m−1 s−1, similar to that reported previously (20Ranson N.A. Dunster N.J. Burston S.G. Clarke A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of His6-tagged E1 was completely dependent on GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP. The 100% control E1 activity (2.08 μmol/min/mg E1 protein) assayed in the presence of E2 and E3 was comparable with that reported previously (35Hawes J.W. Schnepf R.J. Jenkins A.E. Shimomura Y. Popov K.M. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31071-31076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). No E1 activity was reconstituted when Mg-ATP or GroEL/GroES and Mg-ATP were omitted from the refolding mixture (Fig.1). When urea-denatured untagged E1 was used as a substrate, its reactivation kinetics was very similar to that obtained with urea-denatured His6-tagged E1 (data not shown). The requirement for chaperonins for reconstitution of E1 activity was demonstrated by experiments in which GroEL addition to the folding reaction mixture was delayed. The His6-α subunit denatured in 8 m urea was rapidly diluted into the refolding buffer at 23 °C without chaperonins. At different times, aliquots were taken, and a 4-fold molar excess of the GroEL/GroES mixture (molar ratio 1:2) relative to His6-α monomers was added. The mixture was then combined with an 1:1 stoichiometric amount of the GroEL-β complex with respect to the His6-α subunit to reconstitute E1 activity. E1 activity regained with GroEL-His6-α (no delay in GroEL addition) and GroEL-β as substrates was 100% (Fig. 2, 0 min). In a converse experiment, GroEL was added to the denatured untagged β subunit in a time-dependent fashion, and stoichiometric amounts of the GroEL-His6-α complex were added to reconstitute E1 activity. Delayed additions of GroEL to denatured His6-α caused a sharp concentration-dependent decline in the ability of the latter to regain E1 activity with the GroEL-β complex (Fig. 2). The second order rate constant for the reduction in regained E1 activity resulting from delayed addition of GroEL to the denatured His6-α subunit was 2.75 × 104m−1 s−1 at 23 °C. The delayed addition of GroEL to denatured β resulted in a more precipitous fall in renatured E1 activity with a second order rate constant of 9.79 × 104m−1s−1, which was 3.5-fold higher than that obtained with the denatured His6-α. Without added GroEL, the denatured His6-α and β subunits rapidly aggregated upon dilution of the denaturant, as measured by light scattering at 488 nm (data not shown). To further investigate differential dependence on GroEL/GroES between the α and β subunits for proper folding, different molar ratios of the polypeptide-GroEL (abbreviated as EL) complex were used in the refolding studies. To produce complexes with different (subunit)1:(EL)14 stoichiometry, increasing amounts of the denatured His6-α or β subunit in 8 m urea were diluted at 4 °C into the refolding buffer containing GroEL. After purification on a sucrose density gradient, the (α)1:(EL)14 or (β)1:(EL)14 ratio was determined by densitometry scanning of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels. As shown in Fig. 3, when (α)1:(EL)14 = 1:2 and (β)1:(EL)14 = 2:1 complexes were incubated with GroES and Mg-ATP, efficient E1 activity was reconstituted (Experiment 1, Fig. 3, left panel). In this experiment, open GroEL cavities were present in the 1:1 α-EL complex but absent in the 2:1 β-EL complex. In Experiment 2, the unfolded α subunit in 8m urea was diluted 100-fold by rapid mixing into the refolding buffer containing the (β)1:(EL)14 = 2:1 complex. The recovery of E1 activity was comparable with that detected in Experiment 1, indicating that the α subunit did not rapidly aggregate even when all GroEL cavities were initially occupied by the β subunit in the 2:1 β-EL complex. Efficient reconstitution of E1 activity was also achieved, when the β subunit denatured in 8m urea was rapidly diluted into a refolding mixture containing the (α)1:(EL)14 = 1:2 complex (Experiment 3). The presence of excess unoccupied GroEL rings was likely responsible for the formation of the GroEL-β complex and efficient recovery of E1 activity. In Experiment 4, which was converse to Experiment 2, very little, if any, E1 activity was recovered, when the unfolded β subunit was diluted into a refolding buffer containing the (α)1:(EL)14 = 2:1 complex. The failure to reconstitute E1 activity apparently resulted from the absence of GroEL with open cavities for the β subunit. Taken together, this series of experiments demonstrate that the β subunit is more dependent than the α on the immediate availability of unoccupied GroEL ends for preventing misfolding. The release of E1 subunits from GroEL-polypeptide complexes was studied by incubation of the GroEL-His6-α or the GroEL-β complex alone with GroES and Mg-ATP at 23 °C for 4 h. The incubation mixtures were separated on a sucrose density gradient, and fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4 A, a significant portion of the His6-α subunit was released from the GroEL-His6-α complex. The discharged His6-α subunit was present as soluble monomers as determined with a calibrated FPLC gel filtration column (see Fig. 7). A small fraction of GroEL monomers resulting from centrifugation in the presence of Mg-ATP (36Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 2"

According to the crystal structure and mutational studies, this endonuclease consists of two domains, one responsible for protein splicing, the other for DNA cleavage, and both presumably for DNA binding. To define the DNA binding site of PI-SceI, photocross-linking was used to identify amino acid residues in contact with DNA. Sixty-three double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides comprising the minimal recognition sequence and containing single 5-iodopyrimidine substitutions in almost all positions of the recognition sequence were synthesized and irradiated in the presence of PI-SceI with a helium/cadmium laser (325 nm). The best cross-linking yield (approximately 30%) was obtained with an oligodeoxynucleotide with a 5-iododeoxyuridine at position +9 in the bottom strand. The subsequent analysis showed that cross-linking had occurred with amino acid His-333, 6 amino acids after the second LAGLIDADG motif. With the H333A variant of PI-SceI or in the presence of excess unmodified oligodeoxynucleotide, no cross-linking was observed, indicating the specificity of the cross-linking reaction. Chemical modification of His residues in PI-SceI by diethylpyrocarbonate leads to a substantial reduction in the binding and cleavage activity of PI-SceI. This inactivation can be suppressed by substrate binding. This result further supports the finding that at least one His residue is in close contact to the DNA. Based on these and published results, conclusions are drawn regarding the DNA binding site of PI-SceI.

They have been found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes as well as in archaebacteria and are encoded by introns or inteins (for review, see Ref. 3Lambowitz A.M. Belfort M. Annu. Rev.

PI-SceI, a homing endonuclease from yeast, belongs to this group and occurs as an intein within the vacuolar H+-ATPase, from which it is spliced in an autocatalytic reaction (5Gimble F.S. Thorner J.

The mature protein recognizes an extraordinarily long DNA sequence of 35–45 bp,1 bends the DNA, and cleaves the substrate to produce a 4-bp 3′ overhang (5Gimble F.S. Thorner J. J. Biol.

The molecular details of DNA recognition and cleavage by PI-SceI are unclear, in spite of the fact that the crystal structure of PI-SceI is known (8Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). According to the structure analysis and mutational studies (9Grindl W. Wende W. Pingoud V. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1857-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), PI-SceI is composed of two domains, one responsible for protein splicing (domain I) and one for DNA cleavage (domain II), which are connected by two peptide segments. The structure of the elongated domain I consists almost entirely of β-sheets, whereas the compact domain II is an almost equal mixture of α-helices and β-strands. Domain II is built up from two substructures that are related by local 2-fold symmetry about an axis between the two LAGLIDADG sequences. The domain II of PI-SceI is structurally very similar to the homodimeric homing endonuclease I-CreI, which contains one LAGLIDADG motif per subunit and lacks the protein splicing domain. As shown by the crystal structure analysis (10Heath P.J. Stephens K.M. Monnat R. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 468-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the LAGLIDADG motifs in I-CreI form part of the dimer interface while simultaneously positioning one of the conserved Asp residues adjacent to the scissile phosphates. These residues may function to coordinate Mg2+and thereby help to attack the DNA; substitution of these residues abolishes the endonuclease activity of I-CreI (11Seligman L.M. Stephens K.M. Savage J.H. Monnat R.J. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1653-1664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of the analogous residues Asp-218 and Asp-326 in PI-SceI also destroys the nucleolytic activity of this enzyme (12Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas substrate binding of the mutated PI-SceI is not affected, suggesting that these Asp residues are involved in catalysis.

Biol. 1996; 255: 412-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) remain bound to one of the two cleavage products that may be required for the subsequent recombination event which completes the homing reaction. The genetically engineered domain DI of PI-SceI binds specifically and with similar affinity as full-length PI-SceI to DNA containing the PI-SceI recognition site as well as to one of the two cleavage products (9Grindl W. Wende W. Pingoud V. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1857-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), demonstrating that domain I is not only involved in protein splicing but also in DNA binding. In contrast, the genetically engineered domain II of PI-SceI is not able to bind DNA with strong affinity, suggesting that domain I is responsible for a decisive part of the contacts between PI-SceI and its substrate (9Grindl W. Wende W. Pingoud V. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1857-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A similar two-domain structure with a catalytic domain and a DNA binding domain has been proposed for I-TevI (25Derbyshire V. Kowalski J.C. Danserau J.T. Hauer C.R. Belfort M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 494-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The long recognition site of PI-SceI makes it an attractive model for studying the mechanism of DNA sequence recognition by proteins but makes it difficult to model the DNA into the structure of PI-SceI, in particular as it is known that both domains, which may be linked in a flexible manner, are involved in DNA binding (9Grindl W. Wende W. Pingoud V. Pingoud A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1857-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 26He Z. Crist M. Yen H. Duan X. Quiocho F.A. Gimble F.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8233-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the study presented here, we tried to identify residues of PI-SceI in close contact to the recognition site by a photocross-linking technique using 5-iodine-substituted pyrimidines (5-IdU and 5-IdC). We show that PI-SceI can be cross-linked via His-333 to a 5-Iododeoxyuridine (5-IdU) residue located in position +9 of the bottom strand, i.e. the right half of the PI-SceI recognition sequence. Substitution of the cross-linked amino acid His-333 by Ala results in a PI-SceI mutant that is not significantly impaired in its ability to bind and cleave DNA. However, no photocross-linking could be observed with the H333A mutant, demonstrating that the region around His-333 is in close contact with the DNA. With this information and knowing where the active site is located, it is possible to present a model that describes the approximate location of the DNA binding site in the structure of PI-SceI. His6-tagged PI-SceI was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described by Wendeet al. (7Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Oligodeoxynucleotides were chemically synthesized by automated β-cyanoethylphosphoramidite DNA synthesis using 5-IdU-β-cyanoethylphosphoramidites (Glen Research) on a Cyclone plus DNA synthesizer (Millipore) or obtained by INTERACTIVA. To reduce possible deiodination of the 5-IdU and 5-IdC, the final deprotection step was carried out at ambient temperature for 24 h, as suggested by the manufacturer. We used either the minimal full-length recognition sequence (cf. Fig. 1) or the right-half cleavage product comprising the upper strand 5′-GGAGAAAGAGGTAATGAAATGGCAGAAGTCT-3′ (31-mer) and the lower strand 5′-GATCAGACTTCTGCCATTTCATTACCTCTTTCTCCGCAC-3′ (39-mer). Some oligodeoxynucleotides were labeled at their 5′-terminus using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. For analytical scale photocross-linking, approximately 10 μmPI-SceI was preincubated with 10 μmradioactively labeled ds oligodeoxynucleotide monosubstituted with 5-IdU or 5-IdC at various positions of the top and bottom strand of either the full-length recognition site or the right-half cleavage product (cf. Fig. 1) in buffer P (10 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.5, 100 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA) for 30 min at ambient temperature in a volume of 50 μl. Photocross-linking was carried out with a 40 milliwatt helium/cadmium laser emitting at 325 nm (Laser 2000). The total irradiation time was usually 2 h; in kinetic experiments, 0–3 h. Samples of 2.5 μl were withdrawn before and after cross-linking and analyzed on a 15% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were silver-stained and dried, and radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography with intensifying screens or by using an imager. For preparative isolation of the cross-linked PI-SceI/oligodeoxynucleotide complex (see below), the analytical scale was increased 10-fold. PI-SceI (20 μm) was digested under limiting conditions in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 with trypsin at a substrate:protease ratio of 500:1 (w/w) at ambient temperature, similar to that described recently (27Pingoud V. Grindl W. Wende W. Thole H. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8233-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After 2 h of incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cross-linking reaction with nicked PI-SceI (10 μm) was performed in the presence of radioactively labeled ds oligodeoxynucleotide T + 9 (10 μm, right-half cleavage product) for 2 h in buffer P. 5-μl aliquots withdrawn before and after irradiation were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel with subsequent silver-staining and autoradiography. Sequencing of the cross-linked C-terminal tryptic fragment was performed as described recently (27Pingoud V. Grindl W. Wende W. Thole H. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8233-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The cross-linked PI-SceI·oligodeoxynucleotide T + 9 (right-half cleavage product) complex was purified from unreacted PI-SceI by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (HR5/5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After irradiation, the reaction mixture was incubated in the presence of 2 m urea for 5 min at 60 °C and directly applied to the column. The elution buffers used were A, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 and B, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 with 1 m NaCl. The gradient applied was 0–80% B in 40 min. The flow-rate was 1.0 ml/min. The elution was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The purified cross-linked complex of PI-SceI with oligodeoxynucleotide T + 9 obtained by anion-exchange chromatography was concentrated and washed in a Centricon 50 tube with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. An aliquot (5 pmol) was radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of T4 polynucleotide kinase. Free [γ-32P]ATP was removed using a NAP5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radioactively labeled PI-SceI·oligodeoxynucleotide T + 9 complex was digested in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2by various proteases in a reaction volume of 50 μl. Trypsin and chymotrypsin were added to give a final concentration of 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 200 μg/ml. Proteinase K and subtilisin were added to give a final concentration of 2 μg/ml and 20 μg/ml. The digestions were performed for 16 h at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by precipitation with 0.1 volume of 1 m sodium acetate, pH 6.8, and 2 volumes of ethanol. The samples were dissolved in 20 μl of 6 m urea, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.025% xylene cyanole and subjected to electrophoresis on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × TBE and 2 m urea after a pre-run for 30 min with a cathode buffer containing 1 mmthioglycolic acid. The gel was dried, and radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography. 5 nmol of PI-SceI were cross-linked with an equimolar amount of ds oligodeoxynucleotide T + 9 (right-half cleavage product) by irradiation for 2 h at 325 nm. The DNA in the reaction mixture was subsequently radioactively labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The buffer was adjusted to 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 40 μg/ml chymotrypsin was added. The digestion was performed for 2 h at 37 °C. To test the progress of chymotryptic proteolysis, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing TBE (0.5× concentration) and 2 m urea. After the digestion was complete, the whole sample was ethanol-precipitated, redissolved in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 and 2 m urea, and applied onto a Mono Q column. For elution, the following buffers were used: Buffer A, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; buffer B, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 m NaCl. The gradient applied was 0–80% B in 40 min. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. Fractions of 1 ml were collected, ethanol-precipitated, and redissolved in 6m urea, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.025% (w/v) xylene cyanole. 50-μl aliquots of the fractions were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 0.5 × TBE, 2m urea gel. For further purification of the cross-linked peptide/oligodeoxynucleotide adduct, the peak fractions from the Mono Q column were combined and subjected to preparative electrophoresis under the same conditions as used for the electrophoretic analysis. Radioactive bands were visualized by an imager. The cross-linked peptide/oligodeoxynucleotide adduct was extracted from the gel and eluted into 0.5 ml of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8, by shaking for 2.5 h at 37 °C. This solution was lyophilized, and the cross-linked peptide/oligodeoxynucleotide adduct was redissolved in 50 μl of 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.8, was applied to a 4-ml column of Sephadex G25 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted with the same buffer, and lyophilized. The recovery was 400 pmols. For sequencing, the cross-linked peptide/oligodeoxynucleotide complex was solubilized with 200 μl of H2O and centrifuged using a ProSorb cartridge (Applied Biosystems). The membrane was cut out, washed with 5% (v/v) methanol for 5 min, and dried. The peptide was sequenced on a pulsed liquid phase sequenator Model 477A (Applied Biosystems) with a 120A on-line high performance liquid chromatography system according to Tholeet al. (28Thole H.H. Maschler I. Jungblut P.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 510-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 50 pmols of the material were amenable to sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis of the PI-SceI gene was performed by a polymerase chain reaction-based technique (29Ito W. Ishiguro H. Kurosawa Y. Gene. 1991; 102: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) using the primer 5′-GCTATGTTACTGATGAGGCCGGCATCAAAGCAACAATAAAG-3′ to introduce the desired mutation. The sequence of the mutated gene was confirmed by sequencing. The purification of the PI-SceI mutant H333A was carried out as described for wild type PI-SceI (7Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Binding and cleavage experiments were performed as described by Pingoudet al. (27Pingoud V. Grindl W. Wende W. Thole H. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8233-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and bending assays were performed as described by Wende et al. (7Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Photocross-linking experiments with the H333A variant and ds oligodeoxynucleotide T + 9 were carried out as described above for wild type PI-SceI. A 311-bp substrate carrying the PI-SceI cleavage site in the center and the 5-IdU modification in position +9 of the lower strand was generated by ligating two polymerase chain reaction products. The left half, a 187-bp-long DNA fragment with the cleavage site and the modification was produced with the primers 5′-GCGTCGGATCCAGGTCAAAGAGTTTTGG-3′ and 5′-AGACTTCTGCCATTTCATTACCCTCXTTCTCCGCAC-3′ (X, 5-IdU) and a 311-bp DNA fragment as template in the presence of [α-32P]dATP (7Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For the generation of the right half, a 124-bp DNA fragment, we used the primers 5′-GATGGAATTCCCAGAGTTATATC-3′ and 5′-GCGTCGGATCCAAGCTTCTCTGGCTGC-3′ and the unmodified 311-bp substrate as template, again in the presence of [α-32P]dATP. Both DNA fragments were annealed with the 311-bp DNA by incubation at 95 °C for 10 min and, after cooling to 37 °C, ligated with T4 DNA ligase (AGS). The 32P-labeled ligation product was purified by electrophoresis on a 10% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. The 311-bp substrate modified in position T + 9 of the recognition site was incubated with 50 nmPI-SceI and irradiated for 1.5 h at 325 nm as described above. Analytical gel shift experiments were performed in the absence and presence of the 56-bp competitor oligodeoxynucleotide F (7Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Preparative gel shift experiments of the PI-SceI/311-bp T + 9 complex were carried out before and after photocross-linking. Bands corresponding to the upper and lower complex were excised, eluted in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, precipitated, and analyzed on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel containing 1% (w/v) SDS. PI-SceI was dialyzed against a buffer consisting of 30 mm inorganic sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 20 mmdithiothreitol. PI-SceI (6 μm) in the absence and presence of equimolar amounts of a 62-bp substrate (oligodeoxynucleotide G (7Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) was treated with DEPC at final concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mm for 30 min at ambient temperature. To remove the ethoxyformyl residue from the histidine residues, an aliquot of the DEPC-treated mixture was acidified by NaH2PO4 to reach a pH value of 6.25. Hydroxylamine was added to a final concentration of 250 mm, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C. Circular dichroism spectra of 17 μmPI-SceI before and after incubation with DEPC (3 mm) were measured in a buffer consisting of 30 mm inorganic sodium phosphate, pH 6.4, and 150 mm NaCl on a JASCO J-710 spectrophotometer at ambient temperature. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, PI-SceI was mixed with 10,000 cpm of32P-labeled 311-mer polymerase chain reaction product containing the PI-SceI recognition sequence in a total volume of 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 μg of poly(dI-dC)) (27Pingoud V. Grindl W. Wende W. Thole H. Pingoud A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8233-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and bands were visualized and quantified in an imager. To obtain detailed topological information about specific contacts between PI-SceI and its DNA substrate, we performed photocross-linking experiments using either 5-IdU or 5-IdC monosubstituted ds oligodeoxynucleotides comprising the recognition sequence for PI-SceI (Fig. 1). Photocross-linking of halogenated pyrimidines has been used successfully to identify contacts in DNA- and RNA-protein complexes (30Blatter E.E. Ebright Y.W. Ebright R.H.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). 5-IdU is an almost perfect analogue of thymidine (35Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and particularly useful for the study of DNA-binding proteins using oligodeoxynucleotides with a T → 5-IdU substitution in defined positions. It is a photoactivated zero-length cross-linker that has the advantage that cross-linking to regions of a protein not involved in DNA binding is minimized and that irradiation with long wavelength UV light (325 nm) does not lead to the excitation of other nucleic acid and protein chromophores. Mechanistic studies of the 5-IdU chromophore relevant to its use in nucleoprotein photocross-linking have been performed by Norris et al. (36Norris C.L. Meisenheimer P.L. Koch T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5796-5803Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The site-specific 5-IdU- or 5-IdC-mediated photocross-linking method does not depend on information regarding the structure of the protein or the structure of the protein·DNA complex. Efficient cross-linking requires the close proximity of the modified base and a reactive amino acid. Preferential targets are Phe, Tyr, Trp, His, and Met residues (35Willis M.C. Hicke B.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Cech T.R. Koch T.H. Science. 1993; 262: 1255-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Wong D.L. Pavlovich J.G. Reich N.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, the cross-link yield depends on a suitable orientation of the reacting groups. With aromatic amino acid side chains as acceptor, the yield of the cross-linking reaction is significantly enhanced when a π-π stacking interaction between the base analog and an aromatic amino acid residue is possible (36Norris C.L. Meisenheimer P.L. Koch T.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 5796-5803Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We used synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides comprising either the minimal full-length recognition sequence of 36 bp (Fig. 1) or containing the right-half cleavage product of the PI-SceI recognition sequence required for specific binding by PI-SceI (7Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides were substituted with a single 5-IdU moiety that substituted for T, A, or G, or with 5-IdC, which substituted for C, as shown in Fig. 1. It was important to ensure that the presence of such a substitution in the PI-SceI recognition sequence does not interfere with the binding to PI-SceI. We therefore compared the binding of PI-SceI to modified and unmodified DNA in gel shift experiments and found that they are bound by PI-SceI with the same apparent K D of 5–10 nm as the wild type sequence (data not shown). For analytical cross-linking experiments designed to find out which position produces the best cross-link yield, PI-SceI was incubated with the different mono-substituted ds oligodeoxynucleotides for 30 min at ambient temperature at a PI-SceI to DNA ratio of 1:1. The photocross-linking reactions were carrried out by irradiation at 325 nm with a helium/cadmium laser for 2 h at ambient temperature. Among the various positions modified by 5-IdU or 5-IdC in the recognition site, only three positions gave rise to a substantial amount of cross-linked PI-SceI (Fig. 1). Oligodeoxynucleotides with thymine in position +9 of the bottom strand and, to a somewhat smaller extent, guanine in position +4 and adenine in position +5 of the upper strand when substituted by 5-IdU, were efficiently cross-linked to PI-SceI.

https://openalex.org/W2042884810,"The E5 protein of bovine papillomavirus is a 44-amino acid, Golgi-resident, type II transmembrane protein that efficiently transforms immortalized mouse fibroblasts. The transmembrane (TM) domain of E5 is not only critical for biological activity, it also regulates interactions with cellular targets including the platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) and the 16-kDa subunit of the vacuolar proton ATPase (V-ATPase). In order to define the specific TM amino acids essential for E5 biological and biochemical activity, we performed scanning alanine mutagenesis on 25 of the 30 potential TM residues and genetically mapped discrete α-helical domains which separately regulated the ability of E5 to bind PDGF-R, activate PDGF-R, and to form oligomers. Alanine substitutions at positions 17, 21, and 24 (which lie on the same helical face) greatly inhibited E5 association with the PDGF-R, suggesting that this region comprises the receptor binding site. PDGF-R activation also mapped to a specific but broader domain in E5; mutant proteins with alanines on one helical face (positions 8, 9, 11, 16, 19, 22, and 23) continued to induce PDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas mutant proteins with alanines on the opposite helical face (positions 7, 10, 13, 17, 18, 21, 24, and 25) did not, indicating that the latter helical face was critical for mediating receptor transphosphorylation. Interestingly, these “activation-defective” mutants segregated into two classes: 1) those that were unable to form dimers but that could still form higher order oligomers and transform cells, and 2) those that were defective for PDGF-R binding and were transformation-incompetent. These findings suggest that the ability of E5 to dimerize and to bind PDGF-R is important for receptor activation. However, since several transformation-competent E5 mutants were defective for binding and/or activating PDGF-R, it is apparent that E5 must have additional activities to mediate cell transformation. Finally, alanine substitutions also defined two separate helical faces critical for E5/E5 interactions (homodimer formation). Thus, our data identify distinct E5 helical faces that regulate homologous and heterologous intramembrane interactions and define two new classes of biologically active TM mutants. The E5 protein of bovine papillomavirus is a 44-amino acid, Golgi-resident, type II transmembrane protein that efficiently transforms immortalized mouse fibroblasts. The transmembrane (TM) domain of E5 is not only critical for biological activity, it also regulates interactions with cellular targets including the platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R) and the 16-kDa subunit of the vacuolar proton ATPase (V-ATPase). In order to define the specific TM amino acids essential for E5 biological and biochemical activity, we performed scanning alanine mutagenesis on 25 of the 30 potential TM residues and genetically mapped discrete α-helical domains which separately regulated the ability of E5 to bind PDGF-R, activate PDGF-R, and to form oligomers. Alanine substitutions at positions 17, 21, and 24 (which lie on the same helical face) greatly inhibited E5 association with the PDGF-R, suggesting that this region comprises the receptor binding site. PDGF-R activation also mapped to a specific but broader domain in E5; mutant proteins with alanines on one helical face (positions 8, 9, 11, 16, 19, 22, and 23) continued to induce PDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas mutant proteins with alanines on the opposite helical face (positions 7, 10, 13, 17, 18, 21, 24, and 25) did not, indicating that the latter helical face was critical for mediating receptor transphosphorylation. Interestingly, these “activation-defective” mutants segregated into two classes: 1) those that were unable to form dimers but that could still form higher order oligomers and transform cells, and 2) those that were defective for PDGF-R binding and were transformation-incompetent. These findings suggest that the ability of E5 to dimerize and to bind PDGF-R is important for receptor activation. However, since several transformation-competent E5 mutants were defective for binding and/or activating PDGF-R, it is apparent that E5 must have additional activities to mediate cell transformation. Finally, alanine substitutions also defined two separate helical faces critical for E5/E5 interactions (homodimer formation). Thus, our data identify distinct E5 helical faces that regulate homologous and heterologous intramembrane interactions and define two new classes of biologically active TM mutants. platelet-derived growth factor receptor platelet-derived growth factor transmembrane Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium normal goat serum phosphate-buffered saline Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline wild-type polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis The 44-amino acid E5 oncoprotein of bovine papillomavirus type 1 is the smallest known oncoprotein. The first 30 amino acids are believed to constitute an α-helical transmembrane domain, and the C-terminal 14 amino acids are generally hydrophilic, containing two cysteines that stabilize homodimer formation via disulfide bonds (1Burkhardt A.

Immunoelectron microscopy studies have demonstrated E5 to be a type II Golgi polypeptide with its C terminus predominantly facing the Golgi lumen (4Burkhardt A. Willingham M. Gay C. Jeang K.T. Schlegel R. Virology. 1989; 170: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The transformation of mouse fibroblasts by E5 has been attributed mainly to its ability to bind and induce the autophosphorylation of PDGF-R1 (5Nilson L.A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1989; 59: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Other cellular proteins that associate with E5 include the 16-kDa subunit of the vacuolar proton pump (16K) and a 125-kDa α-adaptin like protein. Mutagenic analysis indicates that E5/16K binding may have an important role in cellular transformation and E5, 16K, and PDGF-R co-precipitate in transfected cells (12Goldstein D.J. Andresson T. Sparkowski J.J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4851-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Goldstein D.J. Schlegel R.

Specific interactions between transmembrane α-helices are important for the structure and function of many integral membrane proteins. For example, interactions between two components of the T-cell receptor complex, TCRα and CD3δ, are mediated through transmembrane domains and allow for the functional assembly of the complex (16Cosson P. Lankford S.P. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1991; 351: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 17Manolios N. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Science. 1990; 249: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Similarly, dimerization of glycophorin A has been shown to be dependent upon the amino acid sequence of its transmembrane domain (18Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Treutlein H.R. Zhang J. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12719-12725Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 19Lemmon M.A. Flanagan J.M. Hunt J.F. Adair B.D. Bormann B.-J. Dempsey C.E. Engelman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7683-7689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the assembly of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules appears to mediated by interactions between the transmembrane domains of the α and β chains (20Cosson P. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 1992; 258: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mutagenic analyses of glycophorin A have recently been substantiated on a molecular level by the determination of the structure of glycophorin A dimers using heteronuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (21MacKenzie K.R. Prestergard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). The association between E5 and the 16K V-ATPase subunit is also mediated by transmembrane interactions, specifically by an interaction between glutamine in the E5 transmembrane domain and glutamic acid in the fourth TM domain of 16K (22Andresson T. Sparkowski J. Goldstein D.J. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6830-6837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, we have previously demonstrated the ability of the isolated E5 TM domain to bind the PDGF-R, suggesting that specific binding interactions between the TM regions of these molecules might facilitate their interaction (12Goldstein D.J. Andresson T. Sparkowski J.J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4851-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recent data has defined a threonine residue in the TM region of PDGF-R that might facilitate hydrogen bond formation with the E5 TM glutamine residue (position 17) (23Petti L.M. Reddy V. Smith S.O. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7318-7327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine the contribution of amino acids in the E5 transmembrane domain to its biological and binding properties, a series of alanine mutations was constructed. Twenty-five residues between positions 4 and 31 of E5 were individually replaced by alanine, and the resulting proteins were examined for their ability to: 1) associate with PDGF-R, 2) induce the phosphorylation of PDGF-R, 3) form homodimers, 4) localize to the Golgi apparatus, and 5) transform NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells. Alanine was used in the substitutions since it neither significantly alters protein conformation nor imposes electrostatic or steric effects (24Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. Science. 1989; 244: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the mutants that perturb E5 activities (e.g. binding to PDGF-R, activation of PDGF-R, homodimer formation) cluster within the TM domain in a pattern that is consistent with this domain being in an α-helical conformation. Thus, E5 mutants that activate the PDGF-R align along one predicted helical face and E5 mutants that fail to activate PDGF-R align along the opposite helical face. E5 mutants that fail to bind PDGF-R represent a clustered subset of mutants that fail to activate the receptor. Most surprisingly, only two mutants were transformation-defective (positions 17 and 18). Finally, there were several E5 mutants that retained transforming activity but failed to bind or activate PDGF-R, suggesting alternative mechanisms for cellular transformation. COS-1 and NIH3T3 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The expression vector PJS55 was constructed by adding a polylinker region to pSG5 (Stratagene) and has been described previously (25Sparkowski J. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6120-6123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All alanine point mutants were synthesized via a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using oligonucleotides synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. In the first step of each PCR reaction, two fragments were generated. The first corresponded to the 5′ end of the E5 mutant and was constructed with a 5′ oligonucleotide (5′-TTACATCTCGAGGCCACCATGGACACCTAT-3′) that codes for the initiating methionine of E5 and three residues of the AU1 monoclonal antibody epitope (27Lim P.S. Jenson A.B. Cowsert L. Nakai Y. Lim L.Y. Jin X.W. Sundberg J.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 162: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and also contains an XhoI and Kozak consensus sequence 5′ to the translational start site. The 3′ oligonucleotide used in each of these reactions contained the point mutations of interest and 10–15 nucleotides flanking the codon. They are as follows: L4A, 5′-CTATATACCAAATGCATGGTTTCTATTG -3′; W5A, 5′-CCAAATCTAGCGTTTCTATTG-3′; F6A, 5′-CAAATCTATGGGCTCTATTGTTC-3′; L7A, 5′-CTATGGTTTGCATTGTTCTTG-3′; L8A, 5′-CTATGGTTTCTAGCGTTCTTGGGAC-3′; F9A, 5′-GTTTCTATTGGCCTTGGGACTAG-3′; L10A, 5′-CTATTGTTCGCGGGACTAGTTG-3′; G11A, 5′-CTATTGTTCTTGGCACTAGTTGCTG-3′; V13A, 5′-CTTGGGACTAGCTGCTGCAATG-3′; M16A, 5′-GTTGCTGCAGCGCAACTGCTG-3′; Q17A, 5′-GCTGCAATGGCACTGCTGCTATTAC-3′; L18A, 5′-GCAATGCAAGCGCTGCTATTAC-3′; L19A, 5′-CAATGCAACTGGCGCTATTACTG-3′; L20A, 5′-CAACTGCTGGCATTACTGTTC-3′; L21A, 5′-CTGCTGCTAGCACTGTTCTTAC-3′; L22A, 5′-CTGCTATTAGCGTTCTTACTC-3′; F23A, 5′-CTATTACTGGCCTTACTCTTG-3′; L24A, 5′-CTATTACTGTTCGCACTCTTGTTTTTTC-3′; L25A, 5′-CTGTTCTTAGCCTTGTTTTTTC-3′; L26A, 5′-GTTCTTACTCGCGTTTTTTCTTG-3′; F27A, 5′-CTTACTCTTGGCTTTTCTTGTATAC-3′; F28A, 5′-CTCTTGTTTGCTCTTGTATAC-3′; L29A, 5′-CTTGTTTTTTGCTGTATACTGG-3′; V30A, 5′-GTTTTTTCTTGCATACTGGGATC-3′; Y31A, 5′-GTTTTTTCTTGTAGCCTGGGATCATTTTG-3′. The second fragment was generated using a 5′ oligonucleotide complementary to the 3′ oligonucleotide used in the above reaction as well as a 3′ oligonucleotide complementary to the last four codons of E5 which included a BamHI recognition site downstream of the translational stop site (5′-ATAGCTGGATCCTTAAAAGGGCAGACC-3′). The 5′ oligonucleotides are as follows: L4A, 5′-CAATAGAAACCATGCATTTGGTATATAG-3′; W5A, 5′- CAATAGAAACGCTAGATTTGG-3′; F6A, 5′-CAATAGAAACGCTAGATTTGG-3′; L7A, 5′-CAAGAACAATGCAAACCATAG-3′; L8A, 5′-GTCCCAAGAACGCTAGAAACCATAG-3′; F9A, 5′-CTAGTCCCAAGGCCAATAGAAAC-3′; L10A, 5′-CAACTAGTCCCGCGAACAATAG-3′; G11A, 5′-CAGCAACTAGTGCCAAGAACAATAG-3′; V13A, 5′-CATTGCAGCAACTGCTCCCAAGAAC-3′; M16A, 5′-CAGCAGTTGCGCTGCAGCAAC-3′; Q17A, 5′-GTAATAGCAGCAGTGCCATTGCAGC-3′; L18A, 5′-GTAATAGCAGCGCTTGCATTGC-3′; L19A, 5′-CAGTAATAGCGCCAGTTGCATTG-3′; L20A, 5′-GAACAGTAATGCCAGCAGTTG-3′; L21A, 5′-GTAAGAACAGTGCTAGCAGCAG-3′; L22A, 5′-GAGTAAGAACGCTAATAGCAG-3′; F23A, 5′-CAAGAGTAAGGCCAGTAATAG-3′; L24A, 5′-GAAAAAACAAGAGTGCGAACAGTAATAG-3′; L25A, 5′-GAAAAAACAAGGCTAAGAACAG-3′; L26A, 5′-CAAGAAAAAACGCGAGTAAGAAC-3′; F27A, 5′-GTATACAAGAAAAGCCAAGAGTAAG-3′; F28A, 5′-GTATACAAGAGCAAACAAGAG-3′; L29A, 5′-CCAGTATACAGCAAAAAACAAG-3′; V30A, 5′-GATCCCAGTATGCAAGAAAAAAC-3′; Y31A, 5′-CAAAATGATCCCAGGCTACAAGAAAAAAC-3′. Each of the fragments generated above was separated from primers on 1.2% agarose gels run at 100 V for 30–60 min, cut out, and purified using the Geneclean protocol (Bio 101, Vista, CA). Corresponding fragments were then combined in another PCR reaction along with the 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides listed above. The resulting fragments were precipitated following a phenol/chloroform extraction and restriction-digested with XhoI/BamHI, after which time they were isolated on agarose gels, purified with Geneclean, and ligated into pJS55 vector digested withXhoI/BglII. Conditions for PCR synthesis were as follows: 30 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min. The plasmid containing AU1 epitope-tagged wild-type BPV-1 E5, pJS63, was used as a template in these PCR reactions (25Sparkowski J. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6120-6123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fidelity of all constructs was verified by dideoxy DNA sequencing. For focus assays, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation as described by Graham and Van der Eb (41Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of pJS55-E5 DNA was added along with 5 μg of carrier DNA (pUC19) in 0.5 ml of 1× HEPES-buffered saline. Fifty microliters of 1.2 m CaCl2 was added slowly with mixing and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Each sample was then added to a 50–70% confluent 100-mm plate of cells in 5 ml of fresh DMEM. Following overnight incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) and 2 ml of 15% glycerol in 1× HEPES-buffered saline was applied for 1 min. Cells were immediately washed three times with D-PBS, and 10 ml of DMEM was applied. After 3 days of growth to confluence at 37 °C, the cells were trypsinized, transferred to 175-cm2 flasks containing DMEM, and incubated for 14 days. Flasks were re-fed with fresh growth medium every 3 days and at the termination of the experiment were stained with 1% methylene blue in 100% ethanol (w/v) and foci counted. Transfections to generate stable NIH3T3 lines expressing the above constructs were carried out as described above. E5 DNAs were co-transfected with the neomycin R-conferring plasmid, LNCX, at a ratio of 9:1 (E5 mutant:LNCX). At the time of transfer to 175-cm2flasks, G418 was added and maintained at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. Neomycin-resistant colonies were allowed to form for a period of 2–3 weeks, after which they were pooled and screened for E5 expression using the immunoprecipitation/Western blot procedure described below. E5/PDGF-R protein interactions in NIH3T3 cells were analyzed by a double immunoprecipitation technique described previously (26Sparkowski J. Anders J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For each immunoprecipitation, two 15-cm plates of cells at 90% confluence were utilized. E5 protein was immunoprecipitated using 5 μl of the monoclonal antibody AU1 (Berkeley Antibody Co. (Babco), Berkeley, CA), while associated PDGF-R was isolated in the second immunoprecipitation using 2 μl of the polyclonal antibody 06-131 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (UBI), Lake Placid, NY). Proteins were separated on either 7.5% (for analysis of PDGF-R) or 14% (for analysis of E5 and 16K) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gels. All gels were subsequently fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, enhanced with Enlightning (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 1–28 days at −70 °C. Densitometry measurements were made on a PDI Discovery Series model DNA 35 scanner. For detecting tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF-R, two 15-cm diameter plates at 90% confluence were washed twice with D-PBS and incubated with serum-free DMEM for 14 to 16 h at 37 °C. Prior to harvesting, cells were washed once with PBS containing 100 μmNa3VO4. The cells were then extracted in 750 μl of lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaPPi, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 10 mg/ml aprotinin (Boehringer Mannheim), and 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim). The procedures for immunoprecipitation were similar to those described above. Total PDGF-R was isolated in the first immunoprecipitation using 5 μl of polyclonal antibody 06–131. Phosphorylated PDGF-R was then immunoprecipitated using 2 μl of polyclonal antibody PY-20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer, solubilized in 30 μl of sample buffer, and boiled for 4 min. Proteins were then separated on 7.5% gels, fixed in 30% methanol, 10% acetic acid, enhanced with Enlightning (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-1 film for 7–14 days. In order to determine the competence of E5 mutants to dimerize, two 15-cm plates of the designated cell lines (at 90% confluence) were harvested in RIPA buffer as described previously. Following immunoprecipitation with 5 μl of anti-AU1 antibody, the immunoprecipitates were washed three times with RIPA buffer and solubilized in 30 μl of sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol. These proteins were separated on 14% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in Tris-glycine buffer, either overnight at 20 V or for 2 h at 80 V. Immunoblotting was performed with a Tropix (Bedford, MA) Western Light protein detection kit according to the described procedures. The anti-E5 polyclonal antibody antiserum (1:5000 dilution) was used to detect E5 on the membranes. COS-1 cells were grown on glass coverslips and at 60% confluence were transfected with the pJS55 constructs as described above. Twenty-four hours following glycerol shock, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 20 min. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 20 min with 10% normal goat serum (NGS), 0.1% saponin in PBS. Following two more washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with AU1 antibody that was diluted 1:100 in PBS containing 10% NGS, 0.1% saponin. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 1 h with rhodamine conjugated to goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME), 1:50 in PBS, 10% NGS, 0.1% saponin. The cells were again washed in PBS three times and mounted on slides using Fluoromount (PanData, Rockville, MD) mounting solution. Cells were observed with a Zeiss Axioskop fluorescence microscope. In order to probe the E5 transmembrane domain for residues or domains important in the interactions and functions of E5, 26 of the 30 residues in the putative TM domain of E5 were changed independently to alanine (Fig. 1). The immunological detection and isolation of the mutant E5 proteins was facilitated by the addition of an N-terminal, six-amino acid AU1 epitope, which has been shown to have no effect on E5 biological activity (25Sparkowski J. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6120-6123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the E5 mutants was cloned into pJS55, a derivative of pSG5 (Stratagene) that utilizes the SV40 early promoter for efficient expression in mouse fibroblasts. Previously, it has been shown that the accumulation of E5 in the Golgi apparatus is essential for its transforming activity (26Sparkowski J. Anders J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To determine whether alterations in the E5 TM domain might alter its targeting to the Golgi (and indirectly its ability to transform cells), we transfected each of the designated mutants into COS-1 cells and evaluated their intracellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. The cells were fixed and reacted with the AU1 epitope antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In all cases, the expressed E5 mutant proteins were detected in the perinuclear Golgi region, identical to the pattern observed for wild-type E5 (data not shown). This indicates that no single amino acid residue in the E5 TM region is required for proper Golgi targeting and that any perturbations in the biological activity of the E5 mutants cannot be ascribed to altered intracellular localization. To determine the protein stability and level of expression of each of the E5 mutants, we utilized a combined immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis. Neomycin-selected NIH3T3 cell lines expressing each of the E5 mutant proteins were solubilized in detergent and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibody recognizing the appended AU1 epitope at the E5 N terminus (27Lim P.S. Jenson A.B. Cowsert L. Nakai Y. Lim L.Y. Jin X.W. Sundberg J.P. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 162: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were then separated by PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected by Western blot analysis using antiserum generated against the C terminus of E5 (28Schlegel R. Wade-Glass M. Rabson M.S. Yang Y.C. Science. 1986; 233: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows an SDS-PAGE gel of the E5 alanine mutant proteins that were immunoprecipitated and blotted from NIH3T3 cell lines. All of the mutant proteins were stably expressed in these cell lines, although there was some variation in the absolute level of E5 protein. While the majority of the wild-type E5 (wt E5) was present in cells as a dimer, alanine substitutions at positions 7(Leu), 13(V), 18(Leu), 20(Leu), 25(Leu), and 26(Leu) generated mutants that failed to form dimers and preferentially formed tetramers. These tetramers were not observed when the samples were treated with reducing agent, indicating that disulfide linkages were responsible for tetramer stabilization (data not shown). When the dimerization-defective E5 mutants were plotted as a helical net diagram (Fig. 2 B), they sorted into two distinct zones or faces of the predicted E5 helix (residues 7, 18, and 25, and residues 13, 16, and 20), indicating that two non-contiguous regions regulated the interaction of adjacent E5 molecules in dimers. In addition, E5 mutants at positions 16 (Met) and 31 (Tyr) formed an abundance of higher order oligomers, up to and including hexamers. In most cases, the ability of E5 to transform fibroblast cells has been linked to its ability to bind and induce the phosphorylation of PDGF-R (5Nilson L.A. DiMaio D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4137-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 6Goldstein D.J. Li W. Wang L.M. Heidaran M.A. Aaronson S. Shinn R. Schlegel R. Pierce J.H. J.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4851-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 13Goldstein D.J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 14Goldstein D.J. Finbow M.E.

Virol. 1992; 66: 405-413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is believed that E5-mediated activation of PDGF-R constitutively stimulates signal transduction pathways, which results in a mitogenic response and consequent cellular transformation. In order to define those residues that were important for the binding of E5 to the PDGF-R complex, immunoprecipitates of the indicated E5 mutant proteins from NIH3T3 cell lines were evaluated for the presence of co-precipitated PDGF-R (Fig.3 A). As reported previously, wt E5 predominantly associates with the immature form of the receptor (6Goldstein D.J. Li W. Wang L.M. Heidaran M.A. Aaronson S. Shinn R. Schlegel R. Pierce J.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 4432-4441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Petti L. Nilson L.A. DiMaio D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 845-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Substitution at positions 17 (Gln), 21 (Leu), and 24 (Leu) resulted in mutant proteins that were unable to co-precipitate PDGF-R. While previous studies had identified position 17 as being critical for E5/receptor association (29Sparkowski J. Mense M. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2420-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the current study identifies two additional residues (Leu-21 and Leu-24) that also regulate interactions between E5 and the PDGF-R complex. Assuming that the transmembrane domain of E5 forms an α helix with a periodicity of 3.6 residues per turn, these residues reside in a restricted area on the same face of the helix (Fig. 3 B). While the above experiments clearly indicated that three distinct residues of E5 modulated the association of E5 with the PDGF-R complex, it was important to determine whether these same sites affected receptor phosphorylation. Therefore, each of the alanine mutants was screened for its ability to induce PDGF-R phosphorylation in NIH3T3 cell lines. Cells were grown in the absence of exogenous PDGF ligand (serum-free media), labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and the amount of total and phosphorylated PDGF-R determined by immunoprecipitation as described in Fig. 4 A. Comparison of the ratio of phosphorylated PDGF-R to total PDGF-R revealed that E5 mutants at positions 7 (Leu), 10 (Leu), 13 (Val), 17 (Gln), 18 (Leu), 20 (Leu), 21 (Leu), 24 (Leu), 25 (Leu), 26 (Leu), 30 (Val), and 31 (Tyr) failed to induce significant phosphorylation of PDGF-R. When these mutants (positions 7–25) and their biological activities were plotted as a helical wheel diagram, it was apparent that all E5 mutants defective for inducing receptor phosphorylation were aligned along one helical face and those that retained biochemical activity were aligned along the opposite helical face (Fig. 4 B). Mutants at residues 26, 30, and 31 did not conform precisely to this localization. However, the 19 amino acids between positions 7 and 25 are sufficient to span the plasma membrane as a TM domain and the amino acids distal to this, especially residues 30 and 31, have been proposed to constitute a non-helical, “juxtamembrane” region rather than a transmembrane domain (28Schlegel"

We investigated whether these regions (743PPSVTPAP750, termed Pro-1, and786VPPKPPP792, termed Pro-2) can bind to SH3 domains and whether they are essential for NHE2 function and targeting. A fusion protein containing the Pro-1 region showed promiscuous binding to SH3 domains of several proteins in vitro, whereas a Pro-2 fusion bound preferentially to domains derived from kinases. In contrast, cytoplasmic regions of NHE1, NHE3, or NHE4 failed to interact. When expressed in antiporter-deficient cells, truncated NHE2 lacking both Pro-rich regions catalyzed Na+/H+exchange, retained sensitivity to intracellular ATP, and was activated by hyperosmolarity, resembling full-length NHE2. The role of the Pro-rich regions in subcellular targeting was examined by transfection of epitope-tagged forms of NHE2 in porcine renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells. Both full-length and Pro-2-truncated NHE2 localized almost exclusively to the apical membrane. By contrast, a mutant devoid of both Pro-1 and Pro-2 was preferentially sorted to the basolateral surface but also accumulated intracellularly.

Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholarfor review). In most cells, NHE activity is important for intracellular pH (pHi) homeostasis and also for maintenance of normal cellular volume (3Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in epithelia of the kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs, NHE plays a central role in the absorption of NaCl, bicarbonate, and water. Six distinct NHE isoforms have been identified to date in mammalian cells (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Although the primary sequence homology between the isoforms is limited (20–60%), they all share the same predicted membrane topology, consisting of 12 membrane-spanning segments at the N terminus and a hydrophilic C-terminal tail thought to extend into the cytoplasm (Ref.1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, but see Ref. 4Biemesderfer D. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol.

Functional characterization of deletion mutants of NHE1 and NHE3 has localized the site of Na+/H+ exchange to the N-terminal (transmembrane) region of the protein (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region is believed to be responsible for modulation of transport by such diverse agents as growth promoters, hormones, and changes in medium osmolarity (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). The cytosolic domain is also thought to encompass the site that confers ATP dependence to Na+/H+ exchange, a hallmark of NHE that is common to all the isoforms studied to date (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar,2Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The pattern of expression of individual NHE isoforms varies among tissues. NHE1 and NHE6 are expressed in virtually all cells, whereas other isoforms have a more restricted tissue distribution (1Orlowski J. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22373-22376Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). NHE2 is preferentially expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and, to a lesser extent, in the kidney, uterus, and brain (5Collins J.F. Honda T. Knobel S. Bulus N.M. Conary J. Dubois R. Ghishan F.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 6Wang Z. Orlowski J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11925-11928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite its discovery several years ago, comparatively little is known about the physiology of NHE2. Its selective expression pattern initially suggested a role for this isoform in fluid and electrolyte balance, similar to the function fulfilled by NHE3 in epithelial cells. However, creation of a null mutation of NHE2 in mice caused no significant perturbations of organismal acid-base or salt homeostasis (7Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Instead, the only apparent defect was a significant loss of net acid secretion in the stomach due to a severe reduction in the viability of parietal cells of the gastric mucosa. Although the underlying mechanism is unclear, it was proposed that NHE2 is part of the basolateral transport system that maintains parietal cell volume during high acid secretion at its apical surface and that disruption of NHE2 function causes a chronic state of volume depletion, leading to cellular necrosis (7Schultheis P.J. Clarke L.L. Meneton P. Harline M. Boivin G.P. Stemmermann G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Miller M.L. Shull G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1243-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Whereas an attractive hypothesis, the subcellular distribution of NHE2 in stomach has yet to be determined and, indeed, remains a controversial issue in other tissues examined. On one hand, NHE2 activity was reported to be restricted to the basolateral membrane of an inner medullary collecting duct cell line, mIMCD-3 (8Soleimani M. Singh G. Bizal G.L. Gullans S.R. McAteer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27973-27978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, others detected NHE2 activity predominantly on the apical membranes of ileal tissue (9Wormmeester L. Sanchez de Medina F. Kokke F. Tse C.M. Khurana S. Bowser J.M. Cohen M.E. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1261-C1272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in a cortical collecting duct cell line (10Guerra L. Di Sole F. Valenti G. Ronco P.M. Perlino E. Casavola V. Reshkin S.J. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 1269-1277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similar observations were made when NHE2 was transiently expressed in a colonic carcinoma cell line (11Tse C.M. Levine S.A. Yun C. Montrose M.H. Little P.J. Pouyssegur J. Donowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11917-11924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and apical localization was also documented immunologically in the medullary thick ascending limb (12Sun A.M. Liu Y. Dworkin L.D. Tse C.M. Donowitz M. Yip K.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 160: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, NHE2 is mainly sorted to the apical surface of most polarized epithelial cells examined, as reported for NHE3. By contrast, the functional properties of NHE2 differ considerably from NHE3 and more closely resemble those of NHE1 when assessed in transfected mammalian cells: it is activated by agonists of the protein kinase A and C pathways as well as by hyperosmotic-induced cell shrinkage, and its pHi sensitivity is moderately reduced by cellular depletion of ATP (3Kapus A. Grinstein S. Wasan S. Kandasamy R. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23544-23552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tse C.M. Levine S. Yun C. Brant S. Counillon L.T. Pouyssegur J.

Biol. 1996; 151: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The structural determinants that confer this unique behavior have not been identified. Perusal of the primary structure of NHE2 revealed that the C-terminal region, which is most divergent between isoforms, contains two proline-rich motifs: residues 743–750 (PPSVTPAP), which will be called hereafter Pro-1, and residues 786–792 (VPPKPPP), designated Pro-2. The latter conforms to the consensus sequence of proteins capable of binding Src homology 3 (SH3) domains, φPpXP, where φ is a hydrophobic residue, X is any amino acid, and p tends to be (but is not always) Pro (16Ren R.

These proline-rich regions are unique to NHE2 and may be important in defining the distinctive behavior of this isoform. SH3 domains are sequences of 50–75 amino acids found in diverse proteins that include cytoskeletal components, such as spectrin (19Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P.

The importance of SH3 domains in other systems prompted us to analyze whether the Pro-rich motifs of NHE2 are capable of interacting with SH3-containing proteins and to assess the functional role of this interaction. To this end, we studied the ability of fusion proteins encoding the Pro-1 and Pro-2 regions of NHE2 to bind SH3 domainsin vitro. In addition, we used transfection of epitope-tagged constructs to compare the functional properties and subcellular distribution of the full-length NHE2 with those of mutants lacking either Pro-1 or Pro-2. All polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reagents and Escherichia coli DH5-α were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. pGEX-2T and E. coli HB101 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was purchased from Calbiochem. Luria broth (LB) was obtained from the Ontario Cancer Institute (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Fluorescein-labeled lectins, leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA, antimycin A, reduced glutathione, and glutathione-agarose beads were purchased from Sigma. The NHS-LC biotinylation reagent was purchased from Pierce, and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Nigericin and 2′,7′bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) acetoxymethylester were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies to a peptide derived from the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) were purchased from BAbCo. Goat anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated IgG and goat peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. Horseradish peroxidase coupled to avidin was purchased from Cappel. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contained 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 8 mm sodium phosphate, 2 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The sodium chloride solution contained 117 mm NaCl, 1.66 mm MgSO4, 1.36 mm CaCl2, 5.36 KCl mm, 25 mm Na-HEPES, 5.55 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Sodium-free solutions were made with equimolar substitution ofN-methyl-d-glucammonium solutions of the appropriate salts. Unless otherwise indicated, all solutions were nominally bicarbonate-free and were adjusted to 290 ± 10 mosm with the major salt. Hypertonic NaCl solution was prepared by addition of sufficient NaCl to raise the osmolarity to 600 ± 10 mosm. GST fusion proteins of the Pro-rich regions of NHE2 were prepared by PCR amplification of the appropriate regions of rat NHE2 cDNA (31Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4243) Google Scholar). The PCR product encompassing the more N-terminal Pro-rich region, which contains amino acids 743PPSVTPAP750 (Pro-1) plus 19 and 16 flanking residues at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, was amplified using the primers 5′-ccggatcctcaccagcctac-3′ and 5′-ggaattcgggctgcctcag-3′. The primers used to amplify the more C-terminal proline-rich region containing amino acids786VPPKPPP792 (Pro-2) plus 12 and 21 flanking residues at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, were 5′-ccggatccggccggggcagg-3′ and 5′-ggaattcaccacaagtctgc-3′. The PCR products were purified following electrophoresis in 1.8% agarose (Nu-Sieve Agarose, Biocan) using the Qiaex DNA extraction kit, according to the manufacturer's directions. The Pro-1 and Pro-2 sequences were subsequently subcloned into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HB101E. coli transformed with the resulting plasmid were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin to log-phase, and then expression of the fusion protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were lysed in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 mm EDTA), and the fusion proteins were purified from the lysate using glutathione-agarose beads. GST fusion protein encompassing amino acids 560–690 of NHE3 and 667–717 of NHE4 were prepared similarly. A GST fusion protein containing the last 178 residues of the cytosolic tail of rabbit NHE-1 was the kind gift of Dr. L. Fliegel (University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). Fusion proteins of the SH3 domain of c-Abl, p85, Ras-GAP, N-Src, Src, and α-spectrin were obtained and generated as described previously (32Staub O. Dho S. Henry P. Correa J. Ishikawa T. McGlade J. Rotin D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). GST-SH3 domain fusions were subsequently biotinylated using NHS-LC biotin (Pierce), as described (19Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In Vitro Far Western Binding Assays—Fusion proteins (8 μg) of the indicated regions of the exchangers were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide), transferred to nitrocellulose, and incubated overnight in blocking buffer (0.25% gelatin, 10% ethanolamine, 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0) supplemented with 5% powdered milk. The blots were next incubated with 2 μg of the appropriate biotinylated SH3 fusion protein in 10 ml of blocking buffer for 2 h. The blots were then washed and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with streptavidin-peroxidase (12.5 μg/ml) in a buffer containing 0.25% gelatin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, followed by washing and detection using ECL. The rat NHE2 cDNA was engineered to contain a series of unique restriction endonuclease sites that did not alter the primary structure, but created convenient DNA cassettes for mutagenesis. The modified NHE2 cDNA was inserted into the pCMV mammalian expression vector (plasmid renamed pNHE2) as described previously (6Wang Z. Orlowski J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11925-11928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To allow for immunological detection of the protein, the influenza virus HA epitope YPYDVPDYAS, preceded by a single G amino acid linker (inserted to create peptide flexibility), was inserted at the very C terminus of NHE2 (after amino acid 813) using PCR amplification of a C-terminal cDNA fragment. Similarly, the NHE2Δ777HA and NHE2Δ731HA deletion mutants were engineered by inserting the HA epitope plus a stop codon immediately following positions 777 and 731 of the wild type transporter. The PCR fragments were sequenced prior to substitution into NHE2 to confirm the presence of the mutations and to ensure that other random mutations were not introduced. AP1 is a cell line devoid of endogenous Na+/H+ exchange activity that was derived from wild type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by the “H+-suicide” technique (34Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 267: C1158-C1165Crossref Google Scholar). These cells and the transfectants derived thereof were grown in α-minimal essential medium (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). HEK-T is a subclone of the transformed human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line containing the large T antigen. LLC-PK1 are epithelial cells derived from porcine kidney proximal tubule. HEK-T and LLC-PK1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, ON). Both α-minimal essential medium and Dulbecco's minimal essential medium contained 25 mm NaHCO3 and were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were incubated in a humidified environment containing 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cultures were re-established from frozen stocks regularly, and cells from passages 3–20 were used for the experiments. Where indicated, intracellular ATP was depleted by incubating the cells for 10 min in glucose-free medium with 5 mm2-deoxy-d-glucose and 1 μg/ml antimycin A, to inhibit both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. This protocol has previously been shown to deplete >90% of the ATP in CHO cells within 10 min (35Goss G.G. Woodside M. Wakabayashi S. Pouyssegur J. Waddell T. Downey G.P. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8741-8748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent fluorescence measurements were performed in glucose-free medium containing 5.5 mm2-deoxy-d-glucose. AP-1, LLC-PK1, and HEK-T cells were transfected with plasmids containing the epitope-tagged wild type or truncated NHE2 constructs by the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation technique of Chen and Okayama (36Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For selection of stable lines, the AP-1 cells were selected for survival by repeated acute acid loads (5–6 times over a 2-week period), in order to discriminate between Na+/H+exchanger-positive and negative-transfectants, starting 48 h after transfection (33Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Rotin D. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 267: C1158-C1165Crossref Google Scholar). For stable transfection of LLC-PK1cells, which express endogenous NHE, we subcloned NHE2HA, NHE2Δ777HA, and NHE2Δ731HA into the pBK vector (Stratagene), which contains the neomycin resistance gene. Stably expressing cells were selected by incubation with 500 μg/ml G418 and then screened by immunofluorescence for expression of the wild type or mutant NHEs. For immunoblot analysis, the cells were grown to confluence on 10-cm2 plastic dishes. The cells were washed three times in PBS, lysed in a hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes, 18 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, 50 mosm) and solubilized at 4 °C in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris HCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) containing 1 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The soluble fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blot was incubated overnight in blocking buffer (see above) and then incubated with anti-HA antibody (1:5000) for 1 h in 0.25% gelatin, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, supplemented with 5% milk, prior to labeling with peroxidase-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000). Chemiluminescence was then detected using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL detection kit. Cells were grown to subconfluence on sterile 18 mm glass coverslips (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ), washed with PBS, and fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the excess formaldehyde was quenched with 100 mm glycine for 15 min. Where indicated, the fixed cells were stained with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled lectins (peanut, orange, wheat germ, and pea, 2 μg/ml each) for 45 min at 4 °C. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin and incubated with anti-HA antibody (1:1000) at room temperature for 45 min. The cells were washed again with PBS and incubated with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:5000) for 45 min. The coverslips were mounted using Dako mounting reagent and visualized using a Leica fluorescence microscope. Images were obtained using the Winview program and processed using Adobe Photoshop. The pHi of small groups of cells was determined by microphotometry of the fluorescence emission of BCECF using dual wavelength excitation. Cells grown to confluence on 25-mm glass coverslips (Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ) were loaded with BCECF by incubation with 2 μg/ml of the precursor acetoxy-methylester form for 10 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were then mounted in a Leiden coverslip dish (Medical System Corp., Greenvale, NY) and placed into a thermostatted holding chamber heated to 37 °C (open perfusion microincubator, Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) attached to the stage of a Nikon Diaphot TMD inverted microscope (Nikon Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Cells were visualized using a Nikon Fluor × 40/1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective and a Hoffman modulation contrast video system with an angled condenser (Modulation Optics) through a CCD-72 video camera and control unit (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN) connected to a Panasonic monitor. Clusters of 6–12 cells from the confluent culture were selected for analysis with an adjustable diaphragm. The chamber was continuously perfused at ∼ 0.5 ml/min to allow for complete exchange of the bath solution once every minute using a gravity-driven system and a Leiden aspirator. When rapid solution changes were required, three aliquots of 1 ml of the new medium were quickly pipetted (<15 s) into the chamber and perfusion was continued using the new medium (37Chow C.W. Kapus A. Romanek R. Grinstein S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 185-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were made using an M Series dual wavelength illumination system from Photon Technologies, Inc. (South Brunswick, NJ) in a dual excitation/single emission configuration. Excitation light provided by a Xenon lamp was alternately selected using 495 ± 10 and 445 ± 10 nm filters (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) at a rate of 50 Hz and then reflected to the cells by a 510 nm dichroic mirror. Emitted light was first selected by a 520 nm long-pass filter and then separated from the red light used for Hoffman imaging by a 550 nm dichroic mirror and directed to the photometer through a 530 ± 30 nm band-pass filter. This optical system allowed for continuous visualization of cells without interfering with fluorescence measurements. Photometric data was acquired at 10 Hz using a 12 bit A/D board (Labmaster, National Instruments, Austin, TX) interfaced to a Dell 486 computer and analyzed with the Felix software (Photon Technologies Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). Calibration of the fluorescence intensity to pHi was performed in the presence of 5 mm nigericin in high potassium medium (140 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose) as detailed previously (38Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Each coverslip was calibrated at the end of the experiment using at least three pH values. Quantification of cell-associated fluorescence was performed using the Felix software package (Photon Technologies, Inc., South Brunswick, NJ). The rate of pHi change was derived by linear regression of the pHi versus time curve over 4 s intervals using the Origin software (MicroCal Software Inc., Northampton, MA). To assess whether SH3 domains are capable of binding specifically to the Pro-rich motifs of the cytosolic domain of NHE2 we initially tested the ability of the Src-SH3 domain to bind to this region in an in vitro overlay assay. A GST fusion protein encompassing residues 724–766 and including the Pro-1 region (743PPSVTPAP750) of NHE2 was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and overlaid with the biotinylated SH3 domain of Src, and binding was detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and ECL. In order to assess the specificity of the interaction, GST alone and GST fusion proteins prepared from the cytoplasmic segments of other NHE isoforms, which have no Pro-rich domains, were analyzed simultaneously. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Src SH3 domain bound to the GST-NHE2-Pro-1 fusion protein but failed to interact with either GST alone or with the cytoplasmic regions of NHE1, NHE3, or NHE4. This observation suggests that SH3 domains bind to the cytosolic segment of the exchangers only when Pro-rich sequences are present. We next compared the ability of the Pro-1 and Pro-2 regions of NHE2 to associate with a variety of SH3 domains, i.e. those of Abl, Ras-GAP, p85 of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, α-spectrin, Src, or the neuronal (N-Src). As before, GST alone was included as a measure of the specificity of the interaction. Our results show that none of the indicated SH3 domains interacted measurably with GST (Fig.2). By contrast, all of these bound to the Pro-1 fusion protein, with Ras-GAP interacting most strongly, whereas N-Src bound only marginally. The Pro-2 domain was less promiscuous, interacting strongly with the SH3 domains of p85 and Src, only moderately with N-Src and Abl, but not measurably with either Ras-GAP or α-spectrin. It therefore appears that both Pro-rich motifs of NHE2 can bind SH3 domains in vitro, albeit with different specificity. To assess the functional role of the Pro-rich regions of NHE2, we compared the"

TheRanBP1 gene, unlike other members of the network, is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner:RanBP1 transcription is activated at the G1/S transition and peaks in S cells (6Di Matteo G.

Up-regulation ofRanBP1 transcription during S phase is an important functional requirement for the Ran network activity: we have previously shown that replacing the RanBP1 endogenous promoter with cell cycle-independent regulatory sequences yielded deregulated production of the RanBP1 protein and caused abnormalities in further cell cycle progression, including inhibition or delay in S phase, impaired mitotic exit, and failure of chromatin decondensation at the mitosis-to-interphase transition (8Battistoni A. Guarguaglini G. Degrassi F. Pittoggi C. Palena A. Di Matteo G. Pisano C. Cundari E. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2345-2357PubMed Google Scholar).In previous work, we identified two RanBP1 promoter regions that control separate aspects of RanBP1 transcription (see map in Fig. 1 A). Basal transcription requires a proximal region encompassing the major transcription start site, TS-1 (9Di Matteo G. Salerno M. Guarguaglini G. Di Fiore B. Palitti F. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). That region harbors two prominent genomic footprints (10Stapleton G. Somma M.P. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), termed Sp1.2, acting as a bona fide Sp1-binding site (11Somma M.P. Pisano C. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and Htf9footprinted element (HFE), a basal control element that can interact either with retinoid X receptor family members in quiescent cells or with single-stranded DNA-binding proteins in cycling cells; the latter determines the assumption of an active conformation around the transcription start site (9Di Matteo G. Salerno M. Guarguaglini G. Di Fiore B. Palitti F. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The HFE is flanked by a recognition site for E2F/DP factors, termed E2F-c, which is not footprinted in proliferating cells (10Stapleton G. Somma M.P. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). G1/S up-regulation ofRanBP1 transcription is controlled by a region located from −150 to −90 relative to TS-1 (6Di Matteo G. Fuschi P. Zerfass K. Moretti S. Ricordy R. Cenciarelli C. Tripodi M. Jansen-Durr P. Lavia P. Cell Growth. Diff. 1995; 6: 1213-1224PubMed Google Scholar), henceforth referred to as the distal promoter region. That region includes target sites for E2F/DP (E2F-b site) and Sp1 (Sp1.3 site) factors, both of which are footprinted in vivo in cycling cells (10Stapleton G. Somma M.P. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the E2F sites in the RanBP1 promoter display different protein binding properties in vivo.E2F factors control expression of many cell cycle genes through responsive promoter elements that confer either positive or negative control; precise temporal regulation of these genes by E2F is a prerequisite for ordered cell cycle progression. The E2F DNA binding activity is shared by heterodimeric complexes, in which both subunits are encoded by gene families: one heterodimeric component is synthesized from one of five related E2F-encoding genes and dimerizes with one of three related DP dimerization partner proteins. Control of transcription by E2F/DP dimers is subjected to various levels of complexity (see Refs. 12Bernards R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M33-M40PubMed Google Scholar, 13Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 14Nevins J.R. Cell Growth. Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar for reviews). First, E2F-encoding genes are differentially induced during the cell cycle: E2F-1, -2, and -3 appear in mid- or late G1, whereas E2F-4 and -5 are expressed relatively constantly. Second, transcription of cell cycle genes is controlled by the molecular balance established at any given time between E2F/DP complexes and repressor pocket proteins. Transactivation by E2F/DP heterodimers can be differentially antagonized in the interaction with members of the pocket protein family: E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 preferentially interact with the pRb retinoblastoma gene product (15Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), whereas E2F-4 preferentially associates with p107 and p130, and E2F-5 with p130 only (15Moberg K. Starz M.A. Lees J.A. Mol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1436-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The loss of particular pocket proteins affects distinct sets of genes (19Hurford Jr., R.K. Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), thus pinpointing specific roles for particular E2F/DP/pocket complexes in transcriptional control. These interactions are themselves temporally regulated: the p130 protein is essentially active in G0cells (Refs. 18Vairo G. Livingston D. Ginsberg D.

The interactions of activating complexes with target genes is also dependent upon regulated nuclear transport of particular E2F (23Lindeman G.J. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Ginsberg D. Proc. Natl.

La Thangue N.B. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2819-2831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a further level of control resides in the promoter structure, within which E2F/DP/pocket complexes may productively interact with positive (29Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2905-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) factors; recent experiments with synthetic reporter constructs indicate that the repressing or activating function of E2F elements depends in part on their position relative to neighboring regulatory sequences (33Fry C.J.

We have induced site-directed mutagenesis of both E2F sites to assess their individual contribution to cell cycle regulation ofRanBP1 promoter activity. We have found that the distal E2F-b, together with the neighboring Sp1.3 site, controls up-regulation of transcription at the G1/S boundary. In contrast, the proximal E2F-c site is dispensable for expression in cycling cells, yet is absolutely required for transcriptional repression in G0cells. Thus, both E2F sites independently contribute to cell cycle-regulated activity of the RanBP1 promoter and mediate genetically distinct control mechanisms.DISCUSSIONIn the present work, we have addressed the mechanisms controlling cell cycle-regulated transcription of the RanBP1 gene. We have concentrated on two E2F-binding elements in two previously identified promoter regions that control G1/S up-regulation (6Di Matteo G. Fuschi P. Zerfass K. Moretti S. Ricordy R. Cenciarelli C.

We have found that each E2F site controls a distinct aspect of RanBP1transcription: the distal E2F-b site acts as an activating element and, together with the flanking Sp1.3 element, confers high levels of transcriptional activity during S phase. The proximal E2F-c site instead acts as a negative control element during quiescence. Conclusions drawn from the genetic dissection of the RanBP1promoter are schematized in Fig.12 A.Figure 12Growth control and cell cycle control elements in the RanBP1 promoter.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30483-30490Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), few promoters contain E2F sites in which the functions are clearly separated in genetic terms. Different functional properties were previously attributed to two E2F sites in the p107 gene promoter (45Zhu L. Zhu L. Xie E. Chang L.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar): mutagenesis of the proximal site affected promoter activity more dramatically than that of the distal site, indicating a functional hierarchy between the sites, and the amplified effect of simultaneous compared with single site mutations suggested cooperation. In the RanBP1 promoter, the E2F sites actually exert opposite functions; hence, we have asked which molecular mechanisms underlie these distinct roles.Both sites showed cell cycle-regulated interactions with factors, yet their protein binding specificity was different. G0complexes formed with both sites showed a similar reactivity to antibodies, particularly against E2F-4 and p130. Most E2F-4 DNA binding activity exited the nucleus of NIH/3T3 cells during S phase, as revealed by Western blot assays (Fig. 9), in agreement with studies in different cell lines (23Lindeman G.J.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2120-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). At that stage, a differential reactivity to E2F-1 was depicted for each site, because antibody interference in crude extracts and supershift in overexpressing extracts indicated that only E2F-b, but not E2F-c, interacted with E2F-1 (Figs. 7 and 8). Thus, E2F-1 shows some DNA sequence preference, in agreement with results of recent CASTing experiments that pinpointed a differential affinity of specific E2F/DP heterodimers for particular E2F sequences (46Tao Y. Kassatly R.F. Cress W.D. Horowitz J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6994-7007Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Preferences in E2F/DNA interaction are reflected by the composition of pocket-containing complexes: both sites showed a marked reactivity to the anti-p130 antibody with G0extracts; in S phase extracts, most p130-containing complexes had been disrupted as indicated by the weak antibody reactivity. Complexes assembled with site E2F-b, but not E2F-c, were now supershifted by anti-pRb, further supporting the idea that E2F-b is a target of E2F-1, which interacts with high affinity with pRb.The different protein binding abilities in vitro are paralleled by differences both in site occupancy in vivo and in the activity of mutagenized promoters. E2F-b falls in an extended genomic footprint also covering site Sp1.3 (10Stapleton G. Somma M.P. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of RanBP1 at the G1/S transition (7Guarguaglini G. Battistoni A. Pittoggi C. Di Matteo G. Di Fiore B. Lavia P. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) is concomitant with the synthesis of new E2F-1 (47Ginsberg D. Vairo G. Chittenden T. Xiao Z.X. Xu G. Wydner K. De Caprio J.

Biol. 1995; 13: 1610-1618Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The E2F-b site is a target of E2F-1 in vitro, and mutational inactivation of that site impairs transcriptional activation in S phase (Fig.2 B). Finally, overexpression of E2F-1, but not of other E2F factors, activates endogenous RanBP1 transcription (Fig.11). These data indicate that RanBP1 G1/S up-regulation is mainly controlled by E2F-1 via the E2F-b site.The DNA sequence preference is not sufficient, however, to determineper se the functional role of E2F elements. The position in the promoter context is also relevant. Insertion of the E2F-b site away from the Sp1.3 site, near the HFE, did not support G1/S up-regulation in the absence of a functional distal site (Fig. 10). In contrast, insertion of site E2F-b in the SV40, TATA-dependent promoter near an Sp1-binding site contributed to S phase activation (Fig. 3). Previous reports (29Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 30Lin S.-Y. Black A.R. Kostic D. Pajovic S. Hoover C.N. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1668-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) indicate that neighboring E2F and Sp1 elements cooperate in cell cycle-regulated transcription. Karlseder et al. (29Karlseder J. Rotheneder H. Wintersberger E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1659-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) showed physical interaction between Sp1 and E2F factors and demonstrated cooperation in DNA binding by genomic footprinting analysis of target promoter elements. In our experiments, mutation of the Sp1.3 site affected the RanBP1 promoter responsiveness to exogenous E2F factors, despite the integrity of the E2F-b site (Fig. 4), and inactivation of E2F-b (pmE), Sp1.3 (pmS), or both (pmES), similarly impaired transcriptional activity (Fig. 2 B). These findings suggest that full S phase activity requires the simultaneous interaction of Sp1 and E2F-1 with their target sites in the distal region.Site E2F-c acts instead as the target of repressing factors during growth arrest, because E2F-c mutation derepressed the RanBP1promoter and alleviated the requirements for exogenous activators in G0 cells. Other E2F sites acting as repressing elements include those of the genes encoding B-myb (49Lam E. Watson R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), cyclin A (50Schulze A. Zerfass K. Spitkovsky D. Middendorp S. Bergès J. Helin K. Jansen-Durr P. Henglein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11264-11268Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and E2F-1 itself (51Neuman E. Flemington E. Sellers W. Kaelin W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6607-6615Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and mutagenesis at those sites renders these promoters constitutively active. In these instances, E2F factors essentially act as vectors of repressor molecules to the promoter. In our experiments, E2F-4/DP complexes can activate or inhibitRanBP1 transcription depending on their ratio to pocket proteins: E2F-4/DP1 act as activating complexes when overexpression levels are such that endogenous pocket proteins are titrated (Fig. 4), yet exert an inhibitory role in the presence of co-expressed pocket proteins (Fig. 5 B), implying that they can indeed bridge repressing factors to the RanBP1 promoter.Together, the results support the model in Fig. 12 B: in the proposed model, E2F-4 would essentially act as a vector of repressors in G0 cells. Although both E2F sites can interact with E2F-4, site E2F-c is essential for effective repression. E2F-c is flanked by the HFE, encompassing the TS-1 site. Previous characterization of that element showed binding by retinoid X receptor members in quiescent cells, associated with promoter inactivity (9Di Matteo G. Salerno M. Guarguaglini G. Di Fiore B. Palitti F. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). During transcriptional commitment, retinoid X receptors are displaced by single-stranded binding proteins that expose the TS-1 site, as depicted by the appearance of sensitivity to nuclease S1 in vivo (9Di Matteo G. Salerno M. Guarguaglini G. Di Fiore B. Palitti F. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It is possible that pocket-bound E2F factor(s) interacting with site E2F-c and retinoid X receptors binding to the HFE stabilize each other and/or act in concert to determine promoter inactivity in G0 cells. During G1 progression, pocket protein phosphorylation and nuclear export of E2F-4 would free the promoter from repressing factors; at the same time, coordinated up-regulation of E2F-1 and Sp1 factors would yield a stable complex over the distal promoter elements and hence up-regulateRanBP1 transcription.These results contribute to identify two levels of control for the genes of the Ran signaling network. Examined members thus far are regulated by growth-dependent mechanisms: Ran is induced as an immediate-early responsive gene in the presence of serum (52Coutavas E. Hsieh C.M. Ren M. Drivas G.T. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P.D. Mamm. Genome. 1994; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and RCC1 is induced by the Myc protein through an E-box promoter element (53Tsuneoka M. Nakano F. Ohgusu H. Mekada E. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2301-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In RanBP1, the alternative binding either of retinoid receptors in quiescent cells or of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins in cycling cells to the HFE act as mutually exclusive signals from the proliferation apparatus to the transcription machinery. These mechanisms may converge to coordinately down-regulate the genes of the Ran network in quiescent and terminally differentiated cells. In cycling cells, the Ran network is active in cell cycle coordination (reviewed in Refs. 4Rush M.G. Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar and 5Sazer S. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the molecular balance between RanBP1 and RCC1 is crucial in this control (8Battistoni A. Guarguaglini G. Degrassi F. Pittoggi C. Palena A. Di Matteo G. Pisano C. Cundari E. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2345-2357PubMed Google Scholar, 54Pu R.T. Dasso M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1955-1970Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have shown here that this is essentially achieved by the binding of E2F-1 and Sp1 to upstream promoter sites, yielding high levels of RanBP1 transcription during S phase. These findings further support the view that RanBP1 may act as a pivotal gene linking cell cycle-regulated transcription by E2F factors and the coordination of cellular processes controlled by the Ran network. The murine Htf9-a/RanBP1 gene encodes Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1)1 (1Bressan A. Somma M.P. Lewis J. Santolamazza C. Copeland N. Gilbert D. Jenkins N. Lavia P. Gene. 1991; 103: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a major partner of the Ran GTPase (2Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 81-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). TheRanBP1 gene, unlike other members of the network, is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner:RanBP1 transcription is activated at the G1/S transition and peaks in S cells (6Di Matteo G.

Di Matteo G. Di Fiore B. Lavia P. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Up-regulation ofRanBP1 transcription during S phase is an important functional requirement for the Ran network activity: we have previously shown that replacing the RanBP1 endogenous promoter with cell cycle-independent regulatory sequences yielded deregulated production of the RanBP1 protein and caused abnormalities in further cell cycle progression, including inhibition or delay in S phase, impaired mitotic exit, and failure of chromatin decondensation at the mitosis-to-interphase transition (8Battistoni A.

In previous work, we identified two RanBP1 promoter regions that control separate aspects of RanBP1 transcription (see map in Fig. 1 A). Basal transcription requires a proximal region encompassing the major transcription start site, TS-1 (9Di Matteo G. Salerno M. Guarguaglini G. Di Fiore B. Palitti F. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). That region harbors two prominent genomic footprints (10Stapleton G. Somma M.P. Lavia P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and Htf9footprinted element (HFE), a basal control element that can interact either with retinoid X receptor family members in quiescent cells or with single-stranded DNA-binding proteins in cycling cells; the latter determines the assumption of an active conformation around the transcription start site (9Di Matteo G. Salerno M. Guarguaglini G. Di Fiore B. Palitti F. Lavia P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 495-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The HFE is flanked by a recognition site for E2F/DP factors, termed E2F-c, which is not footprinted in proliferating cells (10Stapleton G. Somma M.P. Lavia P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2465-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). G1/S up-regulation ofRanBP1 transcription is controlled by a region located from −150 to −90 relative to TS-1 (6Di Matteo G. Fuschi P. Zerfass K. Moretti S. Ricordy R. Cenciarelli C. Tripodi M.

Little is known concerning the interaction of these chaperonins with large multidomain polypeptides during folding. In the present study, we investigated chaperonin-dependent folding of a large 86-kDa fusion polypeptide, in which the mature maltose-binding protein (MBP) sequence was linked to the N terminus of the α subunit of the decarboxylase (E1) component of the human mitochondrial branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. The fusion polypeptide, MBP-α, when co-expressed with the β subunit of E1, produced a chimeric protein MBP-E1 with an (MBP-α)2β2 structure, similar to the α2β2 structure in native E1. Reactivation of MBP-E1 denatured in 8 m urea was absolutely dependent on GroEL/GroES and Mg2+-ATP, and exhibited strikingly slow kinetics with a rate constant of 376m−1 s−1, analogous to denatured untagged E1. Chaperonin-mediated refolding of the MBP-α fusion polypeptide showed that the folding of the MBP moiety was about 7-fold faster than that of the α moiety on the same chain with rate constants of 1.9 × 10−3 s−1 and 2.95 × 10−4 s−1, respectively. This explained the occurrence of an MBP-α·GroEL binary complex that was isolated with amylose resin from the refolding mixture and transformedEscherichia coli lysates. The data support the thesis that distinct functional sequences in a large polypeptide exhibit different folding characteristics on the same GroEL scaffold. Moreover, we show that when the α·GroEL complex (molar ratio 1:1) was incubated with GroES, the latter was capable of capping either the very ring that harbored the 48-kDa (His)6-α polypeptide (incis) or the opposite unoccupied cavity (intrans). In contrast, the MBP-α·GroEL (1:1) complex was capped by GroES exclusively in the trans configuration.

The results have established that fusion of a spontaneously refolded protein to the α sequence from E1 does not change chaperonin-dependent folding characteristics of the latter sequence. The native conformation of a large polypeptide is often folded into several compact regions or domains (20Wetlaufer D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Proteins. 1986; 1: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Blond-Elguindi S. Goldberg M.E.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1396-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), show that individual domains in the entire polypeptide chain refold differentially and can be expressed as soluble functional units, suggesting that the domain alone is a folding unit. Co-translational independent domain folding in eukaryotes has been recently demonstrated using a Ras-dihydrofolate reductase fusion polypeptide (26Netzer W.J. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1997; 388: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones do not contain information for specifying correct folding. The information for folding into the functional three-dimensional structure of a protein is solely present in its amino acid sequence (27Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5217) Google Scholar). Thus, one can reasonably expect that independent domain folding also occurs on the GroEL scaffold. The crystal structure of unliganded GroEL double-ring complex has indicated that, in the absence of GroES, a polypeptide of up to ∼35 kDa in size can be accommodated within a single ring of GroEL (28Braig K. Otwinowski Z. Hegde R. Boisvert D.C. Joachimiak A. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 371: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar, 29Chen S. Roseman A.M. Hunter A.S. Wood S.P. Burston S.G. Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. Saibil H.R. Nature. 1994; 371: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Binding of GroES, however, induces a large conformational change in GroEL, leading to an approximate doubling of the volume in the central cavity of that ring. This allows the accommodation of polypeptides of ∼70 kDa in size (30Xu Z. Horwich A.L. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1997; 388: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Because of the size constraint of the GroEL cavity, it has been proposed that GroES promotes the productive release of polypeptides larger than 70 kDa from a transconfiguration, in which GroES and the unfolded polypeptide bind to the opposite rings of GroEL (31Weissman J.S. Hohl C.M. Kovalenko O. Kashi Y. Chen S. Braig K. Saibil H.R. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1995; 83: 577-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, evidence for the productivetrans release of large polypeptides from GroEL is lacking. In the present study, we investigate GroEL/GroES-assisted refolding of the large 86-kDa MBP-α fusion polypeptide in vitro. The kinetic data show that the MBP moiety folds appreciably more rapidly than the α subunit. This explains the isolation of an MBP-α·GroEL binary complex from the MBP-E1 refolding mixture and E. colilysates with amylose resin. Moreover, we provide evidence that GroES can only cap the MBP-α·GroEL complex in trans in relation to the fusion polypeptide. This is in contrast to that observed in the α·GroEL complex where GroES binds to GroEL in bothcis and trans configurations. These findings provide a paradigm for independent domain folding during chaperonin-assisted folding of large multidomain polypeptides. CG712 (an E. coli EStsstrain) and the expression plasmid pGroESL overexpressing GroEL and GroES (32Goloubinoff P. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H.

The pH1 plasmid carrying MBP-α and -β sequences, the pHisT-hE1 plasmid harboring (His)6-α and -β sequences, and the pMAL-c-hE1α plasmid carrying MBP-α sequence were previously described (19Davie J.R.

The MBP or (His)6 tag was fused to the N terminus of the mature α sequence through a linker containing the factor Xa or tobacco etch virus protease-specific site, respectively. GroEL and GroES were overexpressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (14Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol.

CG-712 cells co-transformed with pGroESL and the pH1, pMAL-c-hE1α, or pHisT-hE1 plasmids were grown overnight at 37 °C in YTGK media containing 2 × YT medium (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 10 mmKCl, 1% glycerol, and antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol). The overnight culture was diluted 6:1000 into 1 liter of YTGK medium with added antibiotics. Cultures were grown on a shaker at 220 rpm and 37 °C to a measuredA 600 of 0.6, and expression was induced with 0.75 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactosidase. After induction, cultures were grown at 37 °C for 16 h. The extraction of MBP-E1 and MBP-α from the E. coli lysate with amylose resin was described previously (19Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Cox R.P. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16601-16606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified proteins were separated on a 10–30% sucrose density gradient. Purification of (His)6-E1 on the Ni-NTA column was also previously described (33Wynn R.M. Davie J.R. Chuang J.L. Cote C.D. Chuang D.T. J. Biol.

Undigested (His)6-E1 was removed by Ni-NTA extraction. MBP-E1, E1, or MBP was incubated for 1 h at 22 °C in a denaturing buffer (50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 8 m urea, 0.1% Tween 20, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Refolding was initiated at 22 °C by a 100-fold dilution of the denatured protein into a refolding buffer (50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2) containing GroEL/GroES (molar ratio of GroEL:GroES:monomeric substrate = 2:4:1). Unless otherwise specified, the final concentration of the denatured monomer was 0.5 μm. Rapid mixing was accomplished by vortexing of a denatured protein drop into the refolding buffer, which was immediately followed by an addition of 10 mm ATP. At indicated times, an aliquot of 50 μl was withdrawn and frozen at −20 °C until assays for E1 activity. E1 activity was assayed radiochemically in a reconstituted branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase system with the addition of excess recombinant E2 and E3 components as described elsewhere (14Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). An identical concentration of nondenatured E1 or MBP-E1 was also added into the separate refolding buffer and incubated at 22 °C to serve as the 100% activity control. The folding efficiency was defined as the percent recovery of activity compared with the 100% activity control at the final time point. Unless otherwise stated, at indicated times, aliquots (1 ml) of the refolding mixture was withdrawn, and the refolding reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 mmCDTA to chelate Mg2+ ions. The refolding mixture was incubated with 0.5 ml of amylose resin for 10 min. After a brief spinning, the supernatant was removed and the resin was washed three times with 1 ml of the refolding buffer. Proteins bound to the resin were eluted twice with 0.5 ml of the refolding buffer containing 20 mm maltose. The eluted protein sample was loaded on a 10–30% sucrose density gradient, and separated by centrifugation at 210,000 × g for 18 h. To determine rate constants for the folding of MBP and α moieties, the data were fit to the first-order rate equation: ln[A] = ln[A]0-kt, where [A] = molar concentration of the reactant,i.e. the MBP or the α moiety at a given time; [A]0 = initial concentration of the reactant;k = rate constant for the folding reaction, andt = the reaction time. To determine rate constants for the reconstitution of E1 activity from denatured E1 or MBP-E1, the data were fit to second-order rate equation kt = 1/[A] − 1/[A]0, where [A] = α, MBP-α or -β monomers at a given time. The percent of E1 activity recovered was used to calculate the amount of E1 or MBP-E1 tetramers formed. The same amount of E1 or MBP-E1 not treated with the denaturant was incubated in the refolding buffer for 24 h, and the enzyme activity served as a 100% refolding control. The percent of folded E1 or MBP-E1 tetramers at different time points was calculated. The concentration of remaining E1 monomers was derived by subtracting a 2-fold concentration of the E1 tetramer formed from the initial concentration of the monomer (α, MBP-α or -β). The assumption was that the α and β subunits participating in the E1 refolding reaction either stayed as monomers or complexed with each other to form heterodimers or heterotetramers according to the assembly pathway: 2 α + 2 β → 2 αβ → α2β2 (14Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The concentrations of α and β monomers were identical at any time during the refolding. Therefore, V = k [α][β] was treated as V = k[α]2 =k[β]2, where V = velocity. The second-order equation, kt = 1/[α] − 1/[α]0 = 1/[β] − 1/[β]0 was derived after integration. At indicated times of the refolding reaction, a 100-μl aliquot of the refolding mixture containing 0.5 μm MBP was removed. The sample was digested with 4 μg/ml PK for 10 min at 22 °C, and the digestion then quenched with 5 mm PMSF. The same amounts of native MBP-E1 and MBP were also treated with PK and served as a 100% refolding control. The protease-digested samples were precipitated with 7.5% trichloroacetic acid containing 125 μg/ml sodium deoxycholate, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. MBP-E1 (3 mg) was denatured in 400 μl of the denaturation buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and 8 m urea) for 15 min. The denatured protein was incubated with 200 μl of the carboxymethyl-Sepharose CL-6B resin (Pharmacia) equilibrated with the denaturation buffer for 15 min. The resin was washed with the denaturation buffer containing 60 mm KCl. Denatured MBP-α bound to the resin was eluted with the denaturation buffer containing 300 mm KCl. The eluted MBP-α was repeatedly diluted in 50 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl and 8m urea and concentrated in a Microcon-30 concentrator (Amicon). The denatured protein was diluted into 50 mmpotassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl and 1:1 molar ratio of GroEL to make 1:1 stoichiometric substrate-GroEL complexes. The mixture was separated on a 10–25% sucrose density gradient and the MBP-α·GroEL complex collected. The preparation of (His)6-α·GroEL and β·GroEL complexes was described (14Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The refolding of untagged E1 or MBP-E1 denatured in 8 m urea was initiated by dilution of the denatured protein into a refolding buffer at 22 °C containing GroEL/GroES and Mg2+-ATP. Fig. 1 shows the time course for reactivation of untagged E1. No E1 activity was recovered when GroEL, GroES, or Mg2+-ATP was omitted from the refolding mixture. The folding kinetics of E1 at concentrations of 0.125 μmand 0.0625 μm were fit to the second-order equation, with rate constants of 512 and 417 m−1s−1, respectively. The folding of MBP-E1 also showed an absolute requirement for GroEL/GroES and Mg2+-ATP (Fig.2). The kinetic data at 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 μm denatured MBP-E1 were fit to the second-order equation. This resulted in rate constants of 324, 397, and 407m−1 s−1, respectively, for the reactivation of E1 activity. The average rate constant for untagged E1 was 465 m−1 s−1 and for MBP-E1 was 376 m−1 s−1.Figure 2Time course for chaperonin-mediated reactivation of urea-denatured MBP-E1. The denaturation and reconstitution at 22 °C of the MBP-E1 fusion protein were as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The concentrations of the denatured MBP-E1 tetramer for refolding were 0.2 μm (■), 0.1 μm (⋄), and 0.05 μm (○). The data at all three protein concentrations were fit to the second-order function to produce folding rate constants. Folding efficiencies at 0.2, 0.1, and 0.05 μm denatured MBP-E1 were 67, 99, and 84%, respectively. Δ, GroEL, GroES, or Mg2+-ATP absent.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The urea-denatured MBP was refolded for 1 h at 22 °C in the absence or presence of GroEL·GroES·Mg2+-ATP. The refolded MBP was digested with PK (4 μg/ml) and separated on a sucrose density gradient, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The appearance of MBP on the top of the sucrose density gradient either without (panel A) or with (panel B) chaperonins indicated that the refolded MBP was soluble and resistant to PK digestion (Fig.3). The results showed that limited proteolysis with PK was a feasible approach to monitor MBP refolding. The GroEL 14-mer sedimented to the bottom of the gradient (panel B). The presence of GroEL monomers at the top of the gradient resulted from a partial dissociation of the GroEL 14-mer during centrifugation in the presence of Mg2+-ATP (38Mendoza J.A. Demeler B. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2447-2451Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The refolding kinetics of unfused and fused forms of MBP denatured in 8m urea was studied. Aliquots taken at different times during the refolding at 22 °C were treated with PK, followed by analysis by SDS-PAGE. To increase sensitivity of the folding assay, the PK-resistant MBP moiety was probed with the antibody to MBP by Western blotting. Radioactivity associated with the PK-resistant folded MBP moiety was compared with the intensity of the PK-treated native MBP or MBP-E1 control present at the same level as that used in the refolding reaction. Either control was expressed as 100% folded MBP. As shown in Fig. 4, refolding of unconjugated MBP reached 99.8 and 99.5% of the native MBP control in the absence or presence of GroEL·GroES·Mg2+-ATP, respectively. The plateau levels for refolding of the MBP moiety on the MBP-α fusion polypeptide from the denatured MBP-E1 were 68.3 and 27.2% in the presence or absence of GroEL·GroES·Mg2+-ATP, respectively (Fig. 4). The rate constants for the first-order reaction for MBP folding in the absence or presence of chaperonins were 0.020 and 0.036 s−1, respectively. They were in the same order of magnitude as previously reported value of 0.025 s−1 for spontaneous MBP refolding (39Sparrer H. Lilie H. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 74-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as determined by tryptophan fluorescence measurements. The rate constants for refolding of the MBP moiety on MBP-α in the absence or presence of chaperonins are 1.1 × 10−3 and 1.9 × 10−3s−1, respectively (Fig. 4). These values are an order of magnitude lower than those measured with unlinked MBP. Since the folded α subunit does not possess enzyme activity, the refolding of the α moiety on MBP-α was monitored by the release of MBP-α monomers from GroEL and subsequent assembly of the folded α moiety with β to form the (MBP-α)β dimer or the (MBP-α)2β2 tetramer (14Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Aliquots collected at different times during refolding were separated on a sucrose density gradient, and fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The reaction mixture was not extracted with amylose resin so that measurement of the released MBP-α fusion was not dependent on the prefolded MBP moiety. Fractions 3 to 8 corresponding to MBP-α monomers, (MBP-α)β dimers, and (MBP-α)2β2 tetramers were quantified by densitometry scanning (Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig.5 A, at the 0-min time point, all of MBP-α or -β was complexed with GroEL and sedimented close to the bottom of the gradient (fractions 13–15). The bands in fractions 3 and 4 were dissociated GroEL monomers. At the earlier time points (5 min to 1 h), the majority of MBP-α was present as unassembled MBP-α monomers (fractions 3 and 4) and assembled (MBP-α)β dimers (fractions 4–6). At later time points (2 to 24 h), the dimers were gradually converted to (MBP-α)2β2 tetramers, which peaked in fractions 6–8. The identities of these E1 folding intermediates as separated by the sucrose density gradient were confirmed by fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration (14Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The densities of all folded MBP-α species (fractions 3–8) were summed and the maximum at the 4-h time point was expressed as 100%. The percent of folded MBP-α species was plotted against the folding time to depict the refolding kinetics of the α moiety. The folding of the α moiety reached a plateau in about 4 h (Fig.5 B), which was much slower than the MBP (15 min) on the same fusion polypeptide (Fig. 4). The rate constant for folding of the α moiety fit to the first-order reaction was 2.95 × 10−4 s−1. This rate constant is independent of assembly with the β subunit, since both unassembled and assembled MBP-α species were counted. To measure the percent formation of dimers and tetramers during the refolding, subtotals of the normalized MBP-α signal in fractions 4–5 (in the dimeric state) and fractions 7–8 (in the tetrameric state) were expressed as percents of the maximal intensity and plotted against the folding time (Fig.5 C). No significant E1 activity was recovered (about 10%) until 2 h when an appreciable amount of tetramers accumulated. The time course for recovery of E1 activity was in approximate parallel with that for the formation of MBP-E1 tetramers (Fig. 5 C). The slight disconcordance between the two rates was the result of two separate experiments. The data show that the tetramer, but not the dimer, is the enzymatically active form, and confirm that the slow process in E1 refolding is the formation of tetramers from dimers (14Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Song J.-L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10395-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). During the overexpression of the MBP-α fusion polypeptide with GroEL·GroES in E. coli, a significant amount (10 mg/liter) of the MBP-α·GroEL complex (Fig.6, lanes 11–14) and aggregated MBP-α (Fig. 6, lane 15) were isolated with the amylose resin when analyzed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The data were consistent with the notion that the MBP moiety was folded and capable of binding to the resin. The α moiety on the MBP-α fusion was apparently unfolded and associated with GroEL, resulting in the formation of the MBP-α·GroEL complex. The MBP-α* polypeptide was a preterminated translation product. The MBP-α·GroEL complex isolated from the E. coli lysate produced enzymaticall"

The CD8-E19 protein is represented by a single form, initially O-glycosylated: only about half of it is located in the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas more than 30% of the total is present in the intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi complex. In the latter compartments, CD8-E19 colocalizes with β-coat protein (COP) (COPI component) and shows the higher density of labeling. Conversely, about 90% of the total CD8-KDEL protein is localized in clusters on the endoplasmic reticulum, where significant co-localization with Sec-23p (COPII component) is observed, and unglycosylated and initiallyO-glycosylated forms apparently constitute a single pool. Altogether, these results suggest that KKXX and KDEL retrieval motifs have different topological effects on theirs own at steady state: the first results in a specific enrichment in the intermediate compartment and cis-Golgi complex, and the latter dictates residency in the endoplasmic reticulum.

It has been clearly shown that both motifs are necessary and sufficient to dictate the recycling of reporter proteins from the Golgi complex to the ER (3Pelham H.R.

Key events in this process are the binding of the KKXX signal, exposed in the cytosol, to members of the COPI1 coatomer structure (5Cosson P. Letourneur F. Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 6Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7465-7468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Morphological evidence demonstrates that COPI coatomer and the KDELr are localized in the Golgi complex as well as in the IC (9Oprins A. Duden R. Kreis T.E. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 10Griffiths G. Ericsson M. Krijnse-Locker J. Nilsson T. Goud B. Soling H.D. Tang B.L. Hong S.H. Hong W. J.

The precise pathways of KKXX and KDEL based recyclings have not been unravelled yet, and it is not known whether they converge at some point. The residency in the ER of KKXX and KDEL bearing proteins does not depend only on the recycling pathway. Evidence in favor of a direct retention, mediated by weak protein-protein interactions in the lumen of the ER, has been presented (11Munro S. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar, 12Mazzarella R.A. Srinivasan M. Haugejorden S.M. Green M. J. Biol.

Therefore, due to the likely involvement of retention mechanisms in addition to retrieval mechanisms, proteins naturally resident in the ER are not the ideal model system to study the contribution to protein topology of the KKXX- and KDEL-dependent recycling processes. To overcome this problem, we decided to use a “neutral” reporter, the human CD8 glycoprotein (15Littman D.R. Thomas Y. Maddon P.J. Chess L. Axel R. Cell. 1985; 40: 237-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). CD8 is a type I membrane protein, uniquely O-glycosylated, which is rapidly transported to the PM in heterologous cells after transfection (16Nilsson T. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Anchorless versions of CD8, comprising only the luminal domain, are efficiently secreted (17Lehay D.J. Axel R. Hendrickson W.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1145-1162Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Thus, retention determinants, thought to reside in the luminal portion, should not be present in CD8. Two engineered forms of the reporter were used in our study: (a) the KKXXform, CD8-E19, formed by the ecto- and transmembrane domains of CD8 joined to the cytosolic tail of adenovirus E19 protein, which has a carboxyl-terminal KKMP sequence (18Jackson M.R. Nisson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), and (b) the KDEL form, CD8-K, formed by the ectodomain of CD8 elongated with the SEKDEL sequence (18Jackson M.R. Nisson T. Peterson P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). A striking difference was found in the fate of the two recombinant proteins stably expressed in transfected Fisher rat thyroid cells (19Martire G. Mottola G. Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Turrini I. Serafini-Cessi F. Jackson M.R. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments and oligosaccharide analysis showed that CD8-E19 spends its entire life span within the ER and cis-Golgi complex (where the O-glycosylation process starts), whereas newly synthesized CD8-K spends long time routing within the ER and cis-Golgi complex but eventually escapes from this routing, becomes terminally glycosylated, and is rapidly secreted. Although these results implied that in FRT cells the KDEL-based retrieval system is more leaky than the KKXX-based one, immunofluorescence observations of the steady-state distribution of the two CD8 forms suggested that CD8-E19 might have a relatively higher concentration in the Golgi complex and a correspondingly lower concentration in the ER than its soluble counterpart CD8-K, with important implications for the retrieval mechanisms operating between ER and cis-Golgi complex. In the present study, we have undertaken a quantitative analysis of the intracellular distribution at steady state of the two tagged reporters by immunoelectron microscopy and cell fractionation. We indeed found that CD8-E19 protein is much more present in the IC and cis-Golgi complex respect to CD8-K, which is largely accumulated in the ER. The possible relevance of these results for the understanding of the retrieval mechanisms responsible for the localization of endogenous protein within ER, IC, and cis-Golgi complex is discussed. The following antibodies were used: mouse mAb OKT8 (anti-CD8 protein), from Ortho (Raritan, NJ), mouse mAb N1 (anti-CD8 protein) (19Martire G. Mottola G. Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Turrini I.

Torrisi, and S. Bonatti, submitted for publication. All manipulations were done at 4 °C. Briefly, 7–10 × 107 cells were homogenized by 10 passages through a cell cracker (8.020-mm chamber, 8.008-mm sphere) in 20 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 120 mm sucrose. A postnuclear supernatant fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 5 min in a Eppendorf centrifuge and loaded on top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient made up in the same buffer (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, and 60%, w/v). The gradient was spun in a SW 50.1 rotor tube for 1 h at 43,000 rpm in a Beckman ultracentrifuge, and fractions were collected with a peristaltic pump. All cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 25 °C and processed for postembedding immunocytochemistry. In the case of HPL and KDELr immunolabeling, cells were first permeabilized with digitonin as described (23Tang B.L. Wong S.W. Low S.H. Nathan Subramaniam V. Hong W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 298-304PubMed Google Scholar) and then fixed. The cells were either partially dehydrated in ethanol and embedded in LR White resin at 50 °C or dehydrated in a graded ethanol series by progressively lowering the temperature, embedded in Lowicryl K4 m at −35 °C, and polymerized by UV irradiation at −35 °C. Ultrathin sections of LR White- or Lowicryl K4M-embedded cells were collected on nickel grids and immunolabeled with anti-CD8 followed by protein A-gold (18 nm; 24). In double labeling experiments, the sections were first incubated with anti-CD8 antibody followed by 10 nm of protein A-gold and then treated with the second set of antibodies followed by 18 nm of protein-A gold. Control experiments were performed by omission of the primary antibodies. For HPL labeling, thin sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with biotinylated-HPL at a concentration of 20 μg/ml. After extensive washing, thin sections were incubated with goat anti-biotin colloidal gold (10 nm) for 1 h at room temperature. The specificity of the staining was assessed in control experiments adding 50 mm N-acetylgalactosamine to the first incubation. For double labeling experiments, thin sections incubated with biotinylated-HPL and anti-biotin colloidal gold were successively immunolabeled with anti-CD8 followed by protein A-colloidal gold (18 nm). All sections were finally stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before examination with EM. Quantitative evaluation of immunolabeling was performed as described previously (25Lotti L.V. Torrisi M.R. Pascale M.C. Bonatti S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Detailed studies on the biosynthesis and glycosylation in FRT cells of CD8, CD8-E19, and CD8-K have been previously reported (19Martire G. Mottola G. Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Turrini I.

As shown in Fig.1, Western blotting analysis indicates that untagged CD8 accumulates mostly as the broad mature band of 32–34 kDa, in addition to the unglycosylated and initially glycosylated minor forms of 27 and 29 kDa, respectively (lane 1); CD8-K was represented by the unglycosylated 20 kDa form (70% of total) and the initially glycosylated 22–24 kDa forms (lane 2); and CD8-E19 accumulated mostly as the initially glycosylated 28 kDa form (lane 3), which has a half-life longer than 2 days (19Martire G.

Therefore, at steady state, almost all CD8-E19 and CD8-K proteins present in the cells consist of immature forms, no more than initially glycosylated. To ascertain the relative distribution of the two tagged reporters among ER and IC/cis-Golgi complex, we first performed double immunofluorescence microscopy using calnexin and ERGIC-p58 as marker proteins, respectively (28Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 24Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 90: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, both CD8-K and CD8-E19 appeared to overlap significantly with calnexin (compare panels a andb to panels e and f), whereas only CD8-E19 showed a pronounced co-localization with ERGIC-p58 protein (compare panels c and d to panels gand h), thus suggesting an enrichment in the IC/cis-Golgi area. It is noteworthy that the immunofluorescence labeling pattern of calnexin, ERGIC-p58, and of several other markers for ER and Golgi complex was undistinguishable among FRT cells and the clones isolated after transfection (data not shown), thus excluding alteration of the ER/Golgi area induced by the expression of the various CD8 forms. Next, we analyzed at the ultrastructural level the intracellular localization of CD8-E19 and CD8-K. As shown in Fig. 3, aand b, CD8-E19 is clearly present on the IC, on one side of the Golgi complex, and, more dispersed, on the ER; very little labeling was detectable on the PM (not shown). Conversely, most wild type CD8 is on the PM and the entire Golgi complex (Fig. 3 e), very little on the IC (not shown), and almost none on the ER (Fig.3 e). Double labeling with HPL demonstrated that CD8-E19 is present only in the cis-Golgi complex. HPL binds mostly to GalNAc-bearing glycoproteins, and the addition of GalNAC, the first step in the O-glycosylation process, takes place in the cis-Golgi (30Roth J. Wang Y. Eckhardt A.E. Hill R.L.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 45-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 d, HPL labels only one side of the Golgi complex and overlaps very well with CD8-E19. Interestingly, some HPL labeling was detectable on the IC (Fig.3 c). Because the same occurred in CD8-K expressing cells (see Fig. 4) but never in parental FRT and CD8 expressing cells, this observation suggests that labeling in the IC was due to recycling tagged CD8 forms. Finally, double labeling experiments with KDELr, used as marker of the IC/cis-Golgi area, fully confirmed the distribution of CD8 and CD8-E19 described above (data not shown).Figure 4Immunoelectron microscopical analysis of the intracellular localization of CD8-K protein. Thin sections of LR White-embedded cells (a and c–f) were immunogold-labeled with anti-CD8 polyclonal antibody and protein A-colloidal gold conjugates. Double labeling with anti-CD8 and HPL (d and f) was also performed. Immunolabeling appeared dense and clustered over ER (a) and NE (a, arrows). Parallel morphological analysis on conventional thin sections of cells expressing CD8-K showed several protrusions extending from the NE and clusters of vesicles facing the NE (b, arrows). Immunolabeling with anti-CD8 was also present on IC (c) and on cis-Golgi complex (e). PM was virtually unlabeled (a). Colocalization of CD8-K (large golds) and HPL (small golds) was observed on IC (d, arrow) and over cis-Golgi cisternae (f, arrows). Symbols are as in Fig. 3. Bars: a and b, 0.5 μm; c–f,0.1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A strikingly different distribution was instead observed for CD8-K protein. It was present in high amounts on the ER and NE and appeared frequently clustered (Fig. 4 a). Careful analysis of the immunolabeled regions of the ER and NE (see also Fig. 7, c, e–g) and parallel morphological observations of conventional thin sections (Figs. 4 b and 7 d) revealed the presence of several protrusions extending from the NE and of numerous labeled vesicles facing the NE. CD8-K was also clearly present in the cis-Golgi and IC (Fig. 4, c and e), as shown by the co-labeling with HPL (Fig. 4, d and f) and KDELr (not shown). Conversely, CD8-K was almost absent from the PM and barely detectable on the trans-side of the Golgi complex (Fig. 4, aand e). The untagged version of CD8-K, CD8-S, did not accumulate in the cell (19Martire G. Mottola G. Pascale M.C. Malagolini N. Turrini I. Serafini-Cessi F. Jackson M.R. Bonatti S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3541-3547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and gave only low labeling of the Golgi complex (data not shown). To better evaluate the distribution inside the cells of the different reporters, a quantitation of the immunogold labeling was performed. As shown in Table I, the absolute labeling density and its ratio respect to the ER within each cell clone, clearly indicates the enrichment of untagged CD8 in the Golgi complex and of CD8-K in the ER, whereas CD8-E19 is intermediate between the two reporters, with a relative higher density in the IC and cis-Golgi complex. In the absence of stereological measures of the organelles in FRT cells, we attempted to address the question of the quantitative distribution of the different reporters by a statistical approach, assuming that the compartments should be detectable proportionally to their abundance and size within the cell. TableII reports the result of this analysis: almost 75% of untagged CD8 is on the PM, with negligible amount on ER and IC; about 90% of CD8-K is in the ER and nuclear envelope; but only 50% of CD8-E19 is in the ER, because more than 30% is in the IC and cis-Golgi. Particularly striking appeared the amount of CD8-E19 located in the IC (about 17%), considering that this compartment is most likely the smallest of the three.Table IQuantitation of immunogold labelingCD8CD8-E19CD8-KLabeling densityaLabeling density represents the number of gold particles divided by the surface area, except for the plasma membrane, where the linear length of the membrane has been considered.

To evaluate with a different method the intracellular distribution of the two tagged reporters, we moved to an analytical cell fractionation approach. Postnuclear supernatant fractions from CD8-E19- and CD8-K-expressing cells were analyzed on a discontinuous sucrose gradient, and the distribution of the recombinant forms of the reporter in the separate fractions was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting, ECL detection and densitometric quantitation. As shown in Fig. 5, CD8-E19 was present in fractions enriched for ER derived elements as well as for Golgi stacks membranes, but most striking was the coincidence with the sedimentation of IC elements, as indicated by the sharp peak of ERGIC-p58. Conversely, CD8-K was enriched in the ER zone and less present in the Golgi/IC region of the gradient. Therefore, the results obtained by cell fractionation are consistent with the evidence obtained with immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy,i.e. that CD8-K is more present in the ER and CD8-E19 significantly enriched in the IC. To investigate whether the CD8-K protein molecules residing in the ER contain Golgi modifications, we compared the distribution on the gradient of the unglycosylated and initially glycosylated forms. A version of this experiment in which the CD8-K forms were immunoprecipitated and evidentiated by Coomassie Blue staining of the SDS-PAGE gel is shown in Fig. 6. Remarkably, there was no significant difference in the distribution of the unglycosylated form of CD8-K respect to its initially glycosylated forms, as expected for a protein quickly recycling from the Golgi complex. Strong evidence suggest that COPI and COPII coated vesicles fulfill different functions inside the cell. COPI is involved in the retrograde traffic from the Golgi to the ER, and perhaps also in anterograde intra-Golgi traffic (5Cosson P. Letourneur F.

https://openalex.org/W2090721016,"A library of Escherichia coli fnrmutants has been screened to identify FNR (regulator offumarate and nitrate reduction) variants that are defective repressors, but competent activators. All but one of seventeen variants had substitutions close to or within the face of FNR that contains activating region 1 (AR1). Activating region 1 is known to contact the α subunit of RNA polymerase to facilitate transcription activation. It is now evident that this face also has a role in FNR-mediated repression. Single amino acid substitutions at Lys54, Gly74, Ala95, Met147, Leu193, Arg197, or Leu239, and double substitutions at Ser13 and Ser145, Cys16 and Ile45, Tyr69 and Ser133, or Lys164 and Phe191, impaired FNR-mediated repression of ndhwithout greatly affecting activation from model Class I (FNR site at −71.5) and Class II (FNR site at −41.5) FNR-activated promoters. Although repression was impaired in a second group of FNR variants with substitutions at Leu34, Arg72 and Leu193, Phe92, or Ser178, transcription activation from the simple FNR-dependent promoters was severely reduced. However, expression from pyfiD (FNR sites at −40.5 and −93.5) and a derivative lacking the site at −93.5, pyfiD−/+, remained relatively high indicating that this second group have a context-dependent activation defect as well as a repression defect. The prediction that the substitutions affecting repression were likely to be in solvent exposed regions of FNR was supported by analysis of peptides produced by partial proteolysis of FNR. Thus, FNR-mediated repression at promoters with multiple FNR sites requires regions of FNR that are different from, but overlap, AR1.

Thus, FNR-mediated repression at promoters with multiple FNR sites requires regions of FNR that are different from, but overlap, AR1. The FNR protein of Escherichia coli is a global transcription regulator, controlling the expression of genes in response to oxygen starvation. FNR is predicted to be structurally related to the cAMP receptor protein and acts mainly as an activator of genes involved in anaerobic energy generation (1Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). Generally, FNR activates transcription by binding to a site centered at about −41 in target (Class II) promoters where it makes multiple direct activating contacts with RNA polymerase involving two discrete activating regions of FNR (Fig. 1 A, 2 and 3). Activating region 1 (AR1) appears to contact the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit, thereby preventing inhibition of transcription activation caused by an untethered α subunit. Activating region 3 (AR3) contacts the ς70 subunit of RNA polymerase to activate transcription (2Bell A. Busby S.J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). At promoters in which the FNR site is centered at −61 or beyond (Class I) activation depends on a different AR-α subunit contact (3Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As well as acting as an activator of anaerobic gene expression, FNR also acts as a repressor of some aerobic genes (1Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). Unlike the FNR-activated promoters, there is no discernible pattern of FNR site positioning among FNR-repressed promoters, although a common feature is the presence of multiple FNR sites upstream of the transcription start (1Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). The best characterized of the FNR-repressed genes isndh, which encodes a non-proton-translocating NADH dehydrogenase that is the major primary dehydrogenase of the aerobic respiratory chain (4Tran Q.H. Bongaerts J. Vlad D. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ndh promoter has two FNR sites centered at −50.5 and −94.5, and both contribute to FNR-mediated repression (5Sharrocks A.D. Green J. Guest J.R. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 245: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Green J. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Meng W. Green J. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanism of FNR-mediated repression appears not to be due to simple promoter occlusion, but rather displacement of the RNA polymerase α subunit leads to inhibition of transcription (7Meng W. Green J. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). FNR sites located beyond the region of DNA occupied by RNA polymerase have also been shown to be necessary for efficient repression of thefnr and narX promoters (8Takahashi K. Hattori T. Nakianishi T. Nohno T. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Taniguchi S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, FNR occupation of the far upstream FNR site of the yfiD promoter (FNR sites at −40.5 and −93.5) down-regulates yfiDexpression (9Green J. Baldwin M.L. Richardson J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These observations indicated that FNR-mediated repression of these promoters requires multiple FNR binding sites and thus repression may arise a consequence of interactions between two or more FNR dimers, or between FNR dimers (or tetramers) and RNA polymerase. Therefore a library of fnr mutants was screened for FNR variants defective in repression. Two types of variant were identified: type A was a poor repressor but good activator; type B was a poor repressor but failed to activate transcription from simple FNR-activated promoters. However, the type B variants did activate transcription from the complex yfiD promoter. All the variants isolated, except one, contained amino acid substitutions overlapping the face of FNR that contains AR1, indicating that this surface may have a role in repression as well as in activation and anti-inhibition. Random mutations in the fnr gene carried by pGS24 (a derivative of pBR322 containing the fnr gene in aHindIII-BamHI fragment) were introduced usingTaq DNA polymerase and the following synthetic primers, as described previously (2Bell A. Busby S.J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar): 5′-GCTTATCATCGATAAGCTTCGTGAATATTTTGCCGG (fnr coordinates 1–23) and 5′-CGTAGAGGATCCAGGCTGTACGC (1625–1641), where the uniqueHindIII and BamHI targets are underlined. Following digestion with HindIII and BamHI, the polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into the corresponding sites of pBR322. Plasmids were isolated by standard methods, and mutations in the fnr gene were defined by Applied Biosystems cycle sequencing with the aid of two primers: 5′-AAACATATGGTCCCGGAAAAGCG (520–536) and 5′-GGAAACCTCGATGGTAGCTGAAATCCCGTTCG (866–898). The library of mutagenized fnr genes in pBR322 was used to transform JRG3701, a derivative of JRG1728 [Δ(lacIPOZYA)X74 galU galK rpsLΔ(ara-leu) Δ(tyrR-fnr-rac-trg)17 zdd-230::Tn9] containing a compatibleyfiD-lac reporter plasmid, pGS1000 (10Green J. Baldwin M.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transformants were tested for enhanced yfiD-lacZ expression onL-agar containing: 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-galactoside (40 μg/ml), ampicillin (200 μg/ml), and tetracycline (35 μg/ml). The plates were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 °C for 16 h, after which they were exposed to air. The colonies were monitored and those that became blue first were noted and recovered. The levels of yfiD-lacZ expression were determined by measuring β-galactosidase activity (11Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) with cultures that had been grown anaerobically for 16 h at 37 °C in sealed bottles containing L broth supplemented with glucose (0.4% w/v), ampicillin (200 μg/ml), and tetracycline (35 μg/ml). The pBR322 derivatives containing the mutant fnr genes were isolated and were then used to transform JRG3917, a JRG1728 derivative containing a pRW2-based ndh-lacZ reporter, pndh(2Bell A. Busby S.J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the degree of repression conferred by the FNR variants was estimated by measuring β-galactosidase activity as above. As anaerobic ndh-lacZ expression of fnr strains is enhanced during growth on rich medium (6Green J. Guest J.R. Mol.

Similarly, two simple FNR-activated promoters, the Class I FF-71.5pmelR (FNR site at −71.5) and Class II FFpmelR (FNR site at −41.5), as well as pyfiD promoter mutants with impaired FNR sites at either −93.5 (pyfiD−/+; pGS1062) or −40.5 (pyfiD+/−; pGS1063) fused to lac in pRW50 were used to determine the effects of the selected amino acid substitutions on FNR-mediated activation (9Green J. Baldwin M.L. Richardson J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Wing H.J. Williams S.M. Busby S.J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6704-6710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting of the soluble fraction of sonic cell-free extracts with polyclonal anti-FNR serum has been described previously (14Spiro S. Guest J.R. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1987; 133: 3279-3288PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amount of each FNR variant was estimated by quantitative densitometry using a Vilber-Lourmat imaging system. The FNR protein was purified from a glutathione S-transferase-FNR fusion protein as described (15Green J. Irvine A.S. Meng W. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Aliquots (20 μl, 3.4 mg/ml) of the isolated FNR were incubated at 30 °C for up to 2 h in the presence of either 0.68 unit of trypsin (Sigma), 1 unit of chymotrypsin (Sigma), or 0.1 unit of V8 protease (Sigma). The peptides generated were then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Previous attempts to isolate repression defective FNR variants using the FNR-repressible ndh promoter as a screen were unsuccessful, yielding only FNR proteins with reduced affinity for their DNA target and therefore compromised in both activation and repression (16Williams S.M. Wing H.J. Busby S.J.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, recent analysis of the regulation of yfiDexpression in E. coli (9Green J. Baldwin M.L. Richardson J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) has provided an opportunity to develop a better screen. The yfiD gene has an unusual promoter architecture for an FNR-activated gene, with two FNR sites centered at −40.5 and −93.5 relative to the transcript start. Multiple FNR sites are usually found in FNR-repressed promoters; for example, the ndh gene has FNR sites centered at −50.5 and −94.5 (1Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). Expression of yfiD is dependent upon an activating FNR dimer centered at −40.5, but occupation of the upstream FNR site (−93.5) down-regulates expression (9Green J. Baldwin M.L. Richardson J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, screening a library of randomly mutagenized fnr genes for those that allow increased yfiD-lacZ expression (i.e. FNR variants that still activate from position −40.5, but fail to act as repressors at −93.5) should ensure that the FNR proteins selected are not compromised in DNA binding activity. Error-prone polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis was used to generate a library of randomly mutated fnr genes in pBR322. Transformants of JRG3701 (Δfnr Δlac, containing a compatible yfiD-lacZ reporter plasmid, pGS1000) were screened for elevated yfiD-lacZ expression on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-galactoside plates. Approximately 4000 colonies were screened, and 19 were found to contain plasmids that enhanced yfiD expression (TableI). Estimation of the β-galactosidase activities of anaerobic cultures indicated that all of the FNR variants encoded by the plasmids were defective in the down-regulation ofyfiD expression. Most of the FNR variants were produced in normal amounts, as judged by Western blotting (Table I). Expression offnr is autoregulated, partially by binding at a site overlapping the transcript start such that FNR acts as a molecular brick. Hence, the amount of each FNR variant may reflect their relative affinities for this site as well as any effects that the particular substitutions may have on protein stability. Even those produced at lower levels were expressed well enough for the screening protocol, because, although chromosomal expression yielded least FNR (<5% of that obtained with pGS24), it was still sufficient to allow regulation of yfiD expression comparable with that observed with multicopy fnr (Table I). This reflects the relative abundance of the reporter plasmid (2–5 copies per cell) compared with the fnr-encoding plasmid (15–20 copies per cell). Therefore, the failure to down-regulate yfiD is probably not due to a lack of FNR in the cell.Table ITranscription regulation of FNR-repressed and FNR-activated promoters by 17 FNR variantsFNR variantCodon changeExpressionAnaerobic β-galactosidase activitypyfiDpndhpndhdefined mediumpyfiD−/+FFpmelRFF-71.5pmelR%Miller unitsΔfnr704600240011070140fnr afnr expressed from the chromosome.<576042063002600FNR100680170510822062203160Type A:S13PTCT-CCT100675047902300671024401090S145NAGC-AACI45TbThis variant also contained the substitution C16S, which is known to be neutral for FNR activity.ATC-ACC1001430340800718057902830K54EAAA-GAA10034405101120816097904580Y69CTAT-TGT100562010401470702036001640S133PTCC-CCCG74CGGT-TGT3053004000140072405000650A95PGCA-CCA100220010001800507077004100M147T (2)ATG-ACG100184011201760788046202510K164EAAA-GAA100675027101840745027301000F191L (2)TTC-CTCL193PCTG-CCG50460030001800797576001770R197HCGT-CAT100210011301660811071603020L239PCTG-CCG30471013901820924042901960L239ECTG-CAG20457010802400859551402140Stop-14 C-terminal amino acidcThe additional 14 C-terminal amino acids are: RFFRITHYPFCHNH.TGA-CGA20647016801250945036801670Type B:L34PCTC-CCC303590472012903630340290R72LCGC-CTC56440435015405250880570L193PCTG-CCGF92STTC-TCC205300671025001740285290S178FTCC-TTC10056403900199059101110490Expression of β-galactosidase driven by the indicated FNR variants was measured in JRG1728 (Δlac Δfnr) transformed with pyfiD, pndh, FFpmelR, or FF-71.5pmelR fused to lac.

The figures in parentheses indicate the number of independent isolates. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that most of the FNR variants encoded by the plasmids contained substitutions in the face of FNR that contains AR1 (Table I, Fig.1 A). The only exception was the variant M147T (which was isolated twice) representing a replacement buried in the dimer interface (helix αC). There is no obvious reason why such a substitution should result in the properties observed; however, it should be noted that the M147T variant still retained significant repressing ability (Table I). Many of the substitutions (K54E, Y69C, R72L, G74C, F92S, A95P) were clustered in a series of loops that form the AR1 side of the FNR β-roll. A second cluster was evident in the region encompassing αD to αE (S178F, F191L, L193P, R197H). Four variants (G74C, F92S, A95P, and L193P) had been identified in a previous screen, and it was suggested that the defect in yfiD down-regulation was due to an altered AR1-containing surface in these variants (9Green J. Baldwin M.L. Richardson J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1113-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Five of the 17 variants identified contained two substitutions, but in each case at least one of the replacements was of a residue predicted to be close to or part of the AR1-containing surface. The pBR322 derivatives encoding FNR variants defective inyfiD down-regulation were transferred into JRG3917 (Δfnr Δlac, containing a compatible FNR-repressed ndh-lacZ reporter, pndh; Ref. 2Bell A. Busby S.J.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All the variants failed to repress ndh expression normally indicating that the yfiD and ndh promoters may share a common mechanism of FNR-mediated repression (Table I). As anaerobic expression of ndh is known to respond to nutrient quality in fnr strains (6Green J. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), ndh-lacZ expression was also determined for cultures grown in a defined minimal medium (Table I). The data obtained confirmed the FNR repression defects observed in rich medium. Tests with equivalent strains carrying the FNR-activated Class II FFpmelR-lacZ reporter plasmid, which should be substantially unaffected by substitutions in AR1, indicated that all but four of the seventeen variants were capable of activating transcription. It was expected that all the variants would be competent activators of Class II promoters, because the basis of the original screen depended on FNR activation from a site at −40.5 in theyfiD promoter. Therefore, the response of the simple Class II promoter FFpmelR defines two types of FNR variant: Type A, which fails to repress but activates normally, and Type B, which has both repression and activation defects. This assignment was confirmed using a pyfiD−/+ reporter (pGS1062) with an impaired FNR site at −93.5 (Table I). The Type B variants exhibited much reduced activity at this promoter compared with the Type A proteins. Studies with the Class I promoter FF-71.5pmelR, which requires an AR1-α contact for activation, indicated that the Type A substitutions could be neutral for (R197H), or improve (K54E, A95P) or impair (I45T, Y69C, S133P, G74C, M147T, L193P, L239P, L239E), the AR1 contact. However, any improvement in the AR1 contact was insufficient to allow activation from a yfiD reporter with an impaired FNR site at −40.5, pyfiD−/+ (not shown). Furthermore, the variants G74C and L193P, which activated the Class II promoter well, but were poor at Class I, indicated that the anti-inhibition contact made between the RNA polymerase α subunit and the AR1 face of FNR (required at Class II promoters) is different to the activating AR1 α subunit contact made at Class I promoters. There is no structure available for FNR, but there is evidence to indicate that the predicted similarity with the cAMP receptor protein is well founded (1Guest J.R. Green J. Irvine A.S. Spiro S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996: 317-342Crossref Google Scholar). An essential feature of any regions of FNR involved in contacting other components of the transcription machinery is that they must be solvent exposed. Partial proteolysis of isolated FNR with trypsin (28 possible cleavage sites, 406 possible peptides) or V8 protease (28 possible cleavage sites, 435 possible peptides) followed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the resulting peptides revealed that the substitutions affecting repression were within regions of FNR accessible to the proteases (TableII, Fig. 1 B). Following digestion with trypsin, separation of peptides by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and blotting, 10 Coomassie Blue-stained bands were detected. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the peptides present in each band were determined (Table IIa). Many of the bands contained the same N-terminal sequences, indicating preferential cleavage at a limited number of positions with subsequent C-terminal processing. The preferred tryptic/chymotryptic cleavage points were: Arg6, Lys77, Tyr79, Phe92, and Arg184 (Fig. 1 B). Treatment with V8 protease produced four bands with the N-terminal sequences in Table IIb. These data imply cleavage at positions Glu4, Glu38, Glu117, and Glu123. Therefore, the region encompassing the series of loops in the AR1 side of the β-roll was particularly susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. These results indicate that the regions identified as important for FNR-mediated repression are solvent exposed and also provide further evidence to support the cAMP receptor protein-based predicted FNR structure, because the equivalent positions are known to be surface exposed in the cAMP receptor protein.Table IIPartial proteolysis of FNRBand and apparentM rN-terminal sequencesCleavage position(a)1 37,000GSPGIS–2 36,000gsPGIsGG–3 32,000GSPGISGG–4 28,000GSPGISGG–SYTITEQGLys77tITEQGTyr795 25,000SYTITEQGDEQITGFLys77TITEQGDEQITgFHLTyr796 22,500SYTITEQGDEQITGFLys77TITEQGDEQITGFTyr797 21,000HLAGdLVGPhe92SYTITEQGLys77TITEQGdETyr798 17,000SYTITEQGDEQITGFLys77TITEEQGDEQITGFHLTyr799 14,500GSPGISGGGGGILDS–SYTITEQGDEQITGFLys77TITEQGdEQITGFHLTyr7910 13,000GSPGISGGGGGILDS–SYTITEQGDEQITgFHLys77TITEQGDEQITgFHTyr79IIRRiQsggcAiHArg6GFSPREFRLTMTRArg184(b)1 33,000KRIIRRIGlu42 28,000LDQLDNIIERKKPIQGlu383 17,000KRIIRRIOsGGlu4TSMVcEIPFEGlu117IPFETLDDSGlu1234 15,500KRIIRRIQSGGGlu4TSMVcEIPFETLGlu117Polypeptide products identified following digestion of FNR (68 μg) with trypsin (a) or V8 protease (b).

Transcription can be repressed either passively by promoter occlusion, i.e. when a regulator blocks access of RNA polymerase to the promoter, or actively, in which the regulator makes direct contact with RNA polymerase to inhibit transcription initiation (17Choy H. Adhya S. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1996Google Scholar). The observation that FNR and RNA polymerase can simultaneously interact with the FNR-repressible ndh promoter suggested that, in this case, repression is unlikely to be mediated simply by promoter occlusion (6Green J. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Meng W. Green J. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ndh promoter has two FNR sites centered at −50.5 and −94.5, and it has been proposed that FNR occupation of these sites prevents RNA polymerase α subunit from interacting with DNA (7Meng W. Green J. Guest J.R. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 1521-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Such a repression mechanism may require direct protein contacts between the two FNR dimers and/or FNR and RNA polymerase. Previous attempts to identify FNR variants compromised for repression of ndh-lacZ were unsuccessful, because the transformants recovered contained plasmids encoding FNR proteins with defects in DNA binding (16Williams S.M. Wing H.J. Busby S.J.W. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 163: 203-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However the yfiD-lacZ reporter provided an opportunity to screen out FNR variants defective in DNA-binding, because this promoter, although down-regulated by FNR occupation of a site centered at −93.5, requires an activating FNR dimer (at −40.5) for expression. Using yfiD-lacZ as an initial screen 17 FNR variants defective in repressing both yfiD and ndhpromoters were identified. All but one of the variants (M147T) had substitutions near or within the face of FNR that contains AR1 (Fig. 1,2), a region of the protein known to contact the α subunit of RNA polymerase and thereby facilitating transcription activation (3Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Two types of contact can be made depending on the architecture of the activated promoter. At Class I promoters (FNR site at or beyond −61) AR1 of the downstream FNR monomer makes an activating contact with the α subunit, whereas at Class II promoters (FNR site at or about −41) AR1 makes an anti-inhibition contact (3Williams S.M. Savery N.J. Busby S.J.W. Wing H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4028-4034Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). It is now apparent that the same face of FNR can be involved in repressing transcription at promoters that contain multiple FNR sites and that the regions involved are solvent exposed. This is supported by the observations that (i) the positions of two substitutions (Arg72 and Phe191, indicated inyellow on Fig. 2) are common to FNR variants with altered AR1 or repression properties; (ii) all the repression defective variants (with the exception of the M147T) contain a substitution in the AR1 side of the FNR monomer that forms two clusters overlapping the previously defined positions of AR1 (Fig. 2); (iii) most of the repression defective variants display altered activation from a model Class I (AR1-dependent) promoter (Table I); and (iv) that several amino acids close to those substituted in repression defective variants (Leu34, Gly74, Phe92, Ser178) are sufficiently exposed to allow proteolytic attack (Glu38, Lys77, Phe92, and Arg184). Thus, the simplest explanation for the repression defective phenotype displayed by the FNR variants is that they possess an altered surface that is different from but overlaps AR1 which has a role in repression of promoters with multiple FNR sites. It has been suggested recently that transcription regulators can be viewed as catalysts (20Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is envisaged that activators lower the activation energy associated with one or more steps in the reaction pathway leading to transcription initiation, whereas repressors could increase the energy barriers to be overcome in forming an open complex, thereby inhibiting transcription initiation (20Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the specific configurations of two FNR dimers at thendh and yfiD promoters effectively jam RNA polymerase in one of the intermediate states between the closed and open complex. Indeed, FNR-mediated inhibition of open complex formation at the ndh promoter has been observed previously (6Green J. Guest J.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The data presented here suggest that this could be achieved by direct protein-protein contacts involving the face of FNR containing AR1. The architecture of a promoter is clearly crucial in determining the effect of a particular regulator (or combination of regulators) on transcription (21Savery N. Rhodius V. Busby S.J.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It is not yet established if the repression specific components of the AR1 face participate in FNR-FNR or FNR-RNA polymerase interactions, but it is likely that the various contacts made by the AR1 containing face are subtly different. Indeed, there is good evidence to suggest that, for the cAMP receptor protein the anti-inhibition and activating contacts made by AR1 are different (22Zhou Y. Merkel T.J. Ebright R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The GalR protein is perhaps the best example of an “active” repressor (20Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Like FNR, GalR can act either as an activator (ofgal promoter 2, galP2) or as a repressor (ofgal promoter 1, galP1) and a characteristic GalR-RNA polymerase-gal ternary complex is formed at each promoter because of putative GalR-RNA polymerase interactions. Mutations in the region of the C-terminal domain of the α subunit of RNA polymerase thought to be involved in GalR-mediated activation also relieve GalR-mediated repression (20Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the activator complex at galP2 is an open complex, whereas the repressing complex at galP1 is a closed complex and thus the context of the GalR-RNA polymerase contacts are different. These context effects are proposed to be sufficient to allow a single regulatory protein to act as a both a repressor and an activator while maintaining similar regulator-polymerase contacts (20Roy S. Garges S. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14059-14062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is suggested that the context in which FNR finds itself at the yfiD andndh promoters favors the formation of a ternary complex incorporating FNR-polymerase contacts that render the complex incompetent for transcription activation. In conclusion, the FNR variants identified here provide the first indication that specific regions (amino acids) of FNR that overlap AR1 may be required for transcription repression at promoters with multiple FNR sites. Mutational analysis of the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase α subunit should determine whether FNR can repress transcription via direct contact between the AR1 containing face and RNA polymerase or whether FNR-FNR contacts are the key to FNR-mediated repression at promoters sharing the ndh architecture.

https://openalex.org/W2070088387,"1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7) has often been used in combination with protein kinase inhibitor (N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide) (HA1004) to assess the contribution of protein kinase C (PKC) to cellular processes, including the induction of gene expression. This use of H7 and HA1004 is based upon the fact that H7 inhibits PKC more potently than HA1004 in in vitro assays. Thus, although both compounds are broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitors, inhibition by H7, but not by HA1004, has often been interpreted as evidence for the involvement of PKC in the cellular process under study. Here we describe experiments that show that this interpretation is not correct with regard to the induction of two immediate-early genes,zif268 and c-fos, in PC12D cells. In these studies we confirmed that H7, but not HA1004, potently blocks the induction of zif268 and c-fos mRNA by nerve growth factor, carbachol, phorbol ester, Ca2+ionophore, or forskolin. Surprisingly, however, H7 has no effect on the ability of these agents to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), an upstream activator of zif268 and c-fos gene expression. H7 also does not inhibit preactivated MAPK in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that H7 blocks gene expression by acting at a site downstream from MAPK. H7 has previously been shown to block transcription in vitro by blocking the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Yankulov, K., Yamashita, K., Roy, R., Egly, J.-M., and Bentley, D. L.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23922–23925). In this study, we show that pretreating PC12D cells with H7, but not with HA1004, significantly reduces levels of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II in vivo. These results suggest that H7 blocks gene expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, a step required for progression from transcription initiation to mRNA chain elongation. 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7) has often been used in combination with protein kinase inhibitor (N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide) (HA1004) to assess the contribution of protein kinase C (PKC) to cellular processes, including the induction of gene expression.

In these studies we confirmed that H7, but not HA1004, potently blocks the induction of zif268 and c-fos mRNA by nerve growth factor, carbachol, phorbol ester, Ca2+ionophore, or forskolin. Surprisingly, however, H7 has no effect on the ability of these agents to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), an upstream activator of zif268 and c-fos gene expression. H7 also does not inhibit preactivated MAPK in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that H7 blocks gene expression by acting at a site downstream from MAPK. H7 has previously been shown to block transcription in vitro by blocking the phosphorylation of the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (Yankulov, K., Yamashita, K., Roy, R., Egly, J.-M., and Bentley, D. L.(1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 23922–23925). In this study, we show that pretreating PC12D cells with H7, but not with HA1004, significantly reduces levels of phosphorylated RNA polymerase II in vivo. These results suggest that H7 blocks gene expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, a step required for progression from transcription initiation to mRNA chain elongation. nerve growth factor phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate protein kinase C protein kinase A mitogen-activated protein kinase serum response element cAMP response element carboxyl-terminal domain (of RNA polymerase II) transcription factor IIH [1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine] N-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide N-[2-(p-bromocinnamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide 5, 6-dicholoro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzidazole 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid [N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide] chloramphenicol acetyltransferase Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium MAP kinase/ERK-activating kinase phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride The immediate-early genes zif268 (also termedNGFI-A, egr-1, krox24, TIS8; reviewed in Ref. 1Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Wilce P.A. Neurochem. Int. 1997; 31: 477-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 4Herrera D.G. Robertson H.A. Prog. Neurobiol. (New York). 1996; 50: 83-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that NGF1 (1Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and the carbachol (carbamylcholine) cause the rapid induction of zif268mRNA in PC12D cells (5Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Induction of zif268mRNA by NGF is mediated by the high affinity NGF receptor, TrkA, which activates the Ras/MAPK cascade (6Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Induction by carbachol is mediated by the m1 subtype of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which activates phospholipase C to produce the second messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (5Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate trigger the release of Ca2+ from internal stores, which in turn opens “capacitative influx” Ca2+ channels in the cell membrane, resulting in a sustained influx of extracellular Ca2+. 2F.-F. Guo, T. Ebihara, and D. Saffen, D., manuscript in preparation. Increased levels of diacylglycerol activate PKC. Both the sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of PKC contribute to the induction of zif268 mRNA (5Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), at least in part by activating the MAPK cascade (81Kumahara E. Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; (in press): 125Google Scholar). Activation of the MAPK cascade is therefore a common element in the intracellular signaling events leading to gene expression that are initiated by NGF and carbachol in PC12D cells. In the course of investigating the involvement of PKC in the induction of zif268 mRNA by NGF and carbachol, we compared the effects of pretreating PC12D cells with the protein kinase inhibitor H7 (7Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar) with pretreatment of the cells with the related compound HA1004 (8Asano T. Hidaka H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1984; 231: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar). Both H7 and HA1004 are broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitors, but H7 inhibits PKC more potently than HA1004 (K i values = 6 and 40 μm for H7 and HA1004, respectively) in in vitro assays (7Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Based upon this difference, many investigators have used these inhibitors in combination to evaluate the role of PKC in various cellular processes, including the induction of gene expression. In many of these studies, inhibition by H7 in the absence of inhibition by HA1004 was taken as evidence for a role for PKC in the process under investigation. The data presented in this paper, however, shows that inhibition of gene expression by H7 does not necessarily imply that PKC is involved. Rather, we found that although H7 potently inhibits the induction ofzif268 and c-fos mRNAs following activation of PKC with phorbol ester, it fails to prevent activation of MAPK by phorbol ester. This shows that H7 can block the induction of gene expression without blocking PKC. Examination of the literature indicates that H7 blocks the induction of a broad spectrum of rapidly inducible genes by a variety of stimuli, including stimuli not previously associated with the activation of PKC. These observations suggest that H7 may block a site, different from PKC, that is universally required for the induction of rapidly inducible genes. A previous report that H7 blocks transcriptionin vitro by inhibiting the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by a TFIIH-associated kinase (9Yankulov K. Yamashita K. Roy R. Egly J.-M. Bentley D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23922-23925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), led us to examine the effect of H7 on phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II in vivo. In the present study we show that pretreatment of PC12D cells with H7 significantly reduces levels of phosphorylated RNA polymerase IIin vivo, suggesting that H7 blocks gene expression by directly inhibiting transcription. H7 was purchased from Seikagaku Kogyo and Calbiochem. This H7 is the authentic compound originally described by Hidaka et al. (7Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar) and not the less potent iso-H7, which has sometimes been sold under the H7 label (10Quick J. Ware J.A. Driedger P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HA1004, H8, and H89 were from Seikagaku Kogyo. NGF, carbachol, ATP, chloramphenicol, Ca2+ ionophore A23187, thapsigargin, forskolin, dideoxyforskolin, and dimethyl sulfoxide were purchased from Wako Chemical Industries. K252a and staurosporin were from Kyowa Medex Co., Inc. GF109203x, PD098059, and 5,6-dicholoro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzidazole (DRB) were purchased from Calbiochem. PMA, 4-α-PMA, acetyl-CoA, andS-acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dCTP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and [3H]sodium acetate was from NEN Life Science Products. Anti-Erk-1 and anti-Erk-2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Restriction enzymes and other reagents for modification of DNA were obtained from Toyobo Corp., Takara Shuzo Co., and New England Biolabs. Murinezif268 cDNA (ATCC number 63027), murine c-fos genomic DNA (ATCC number 41041), and the expression vector pBLCAT2 were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection. Human cyclophilin cDNA was a gift from Toshio Watanabe (Tohoku University), and pEGF-BOS (11Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) was a gift from Shigeki Nagata (Osaka Bioscience Institute). PC12D cells (12Katoh-Semba R. Kitajima S. Yamazaki Y. Sano M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1987; 17: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), a rapidly differentiating subline of rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells (13Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar), were a gift from Mamoru Sano (Dept. of Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine). PC12D cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nissui) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% horse serum, 0.16% sodium bicarbonate, 3.6 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, 45 ng/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Non-differentiated PC12D cells were used in all of the experiments. Unless noted, drugs were added directly to the culture medium and were present until the time at which the cells were harvested. The corresponding vehicle (water, Me2SO, or ethanol) was added to control cells. MAPK assays were performed as described by Cook and McCormick (14Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, PC12D cells grown to 80–90% confluency in 3.5 cm in uncoated plastic culture dishes (Corning or Iwaki Glass Co.) were stimulated with various agents for 10 min and then lysed by addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 20 μm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After brief centrifugation to remove cellular debris, 0.1 μg of anti-Erk-1 and 0.1 μg of anti-Erk-2 antibodies were added to the supernatant fractions, and these were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation to provide gentle mixing. Protein A-agarose (10 μl of resin suspension, Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-2001) was subsequently added to each sample and the incubation continued with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. The resin in each sample was then collected by centrifugation (2500 rpm) and washed twice with 200 μl of lysis buffer and once with 200 μl of 2× reaction buffer. 1× reaction buffer contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 25 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 15 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm NaF, 4 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4. 22 μl of reaction mix containing 25 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 15 μm myelin basic protein in 1× reaction buffer was added to the resin, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reaction mixes were directly spotted on Whatman phosphocellulose filters, and filters were washed 6 times in 1% phosphoric acid for 5 min each wash. Radioactivity retained on the filters was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. During the course of this study, we determined that, unlike the anti-Erk-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz C-16), the anti-ErK-2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number C-14) were not very effective in immunoprecipitating Erk-2 from cell lysates. 3E. Kumahara and D. Saffen, unpublished observations. MAPK activities reported in this paper therefore reflect primarily Erk-1 activities. Qualitative assays of MAPK activation determined by measuring the activation-correlated shift-up in electrophoretic mobilities (15Howe L.R. Leevers S.J. Gomez N. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) showed, however, that Erk-1 and Erk-2 responded in the same manner to all treatments examined.3 RNA was isolated from PC12D cells grown to 80–90% confluency in 6-cm uncoated plastic dishes, and Northern analysis was carried out as described previously (5Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The amount of RNA in each sample was determined by optical spectroscopy, and the integrity of the RNA in each sample was assessed by examining the ethidium bromide-stained RNA in denaturing gel used for Northern blot analysis. Unless noted, 10 μg of total cellular RNA was electrophoresed in each lane. After blotting onto Pall Biodyne type B transfer membranes (0.45-μm pore size), hybridization was carried out simultaneously using DNA probes prepared fromzif268, c-fos (coding regions), and cyclophilin DNA fragments isolated from agarose gels and labeled using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Oligolabeling kit and [α-32P]dCTP. The intensities of bands in Northern blots were quantified using a Fuji Bioimaging analyzer BAS2000. An expression vector, pGLzif420, containing a firefly luciferase reporter gene linked to the ratzif268 promoter was constructed using pGL2 (Promega). Briefly, the zif268 promoter region (from −420 to 0 base pairs) containing 6 SRE sites and 2 CRE sites was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotide primers (forward primer corresponding to nucleic acid residues 121–149 of the rat zif268 promoter in the numbering system of Changelion et al. (Ref. 16Changelian P.S. Feng P. King T.C. Milbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number J04154), 5′-AACACCATATAAGGAGCAGGAAGGATCCC-3′; backward primer containing a synthetic EcoRI site followed by nucleic acid residues 941–920 (14Cook S.J. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 262: 1069-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) of the rat zif268gene, 5′-(GCGAATTC)TTGCTCAGCAGCATCATCTCCT-3′). This polymerase chain reaction product was blunt-ended, digested withNruI, and the fragment containing thezif268 promoter sequences cloned into the blunt-endedHindIII site of pGL2. An expression vector containing the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of the human elongation factor 1α promoter was constructed as follows: pBLCAT2 was digested with BamHI andBglII and then self-ligated. Digestion of the resulting plasmid with SalI and SmaI yielded a 1.5-kilobase pair fragment containing the CAT gene and a polyadenylation signal derived from SV40. This fragment was isolated, blunt-ended, and cloned into the XbaI site (after converting XbaI-cut ends to blunt ends) of pEF-BOS. The resulting vector, pEF-CAT, was used as an internal control in transfection experiments usingzif268-luciferase expression vectors. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) essentially as recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were seeded in 6-cm plastic culture dishes (Corning or Iwaki Glass) at a density of 4 × 106 cells/dish and cultured for 1 day prior to transfection. 0.92 μg of pEF-CAT DNA, 2.3 μg of luciferase expression vector DNA, 13.8 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent were added to each dish of cells and incubated for 4 h, prior to adding the medium containing twice the normal concentration of serum. After incubation overnight, the cells in each 6-cm dish were resuspended and distributed into 12 × 1.1-cm wells. The following day, the medium was replaced with normal DMEM, and the cells were cultured for 1 more day. Drugs were added directly to the culture medium, and cells were harvested after 4 h. Luciferase expression was carried out using the Promega Luciferase or Packard LucLite™, and luciferase activities were quantified using a Packard Tri-Carb or Top count scintillation counter as described in the manuals supplied by Promega and Packard. Background luciferase expression was determined using cells transfected with pGL2, which lacks a promoter for luciferase gene expression. Transfection efficiency was determined by cotransfection with pEF-CAT. CAT activities were measured as described by Nordeen et al. (17Nordeen S.K. Green P.P. Fowlkes D.M. DNA (N. Y.). 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and these values were used to calculate normalized luciferase activities for each sample. PC12D cells were labeled with 32P in vivo as described (18Cadena D.L. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12468-12474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12D cells grown to 80–90% confluency in 10-cm culture plates were washed twice with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.0)-buffered saline (TBS) and overlaid with 5 ml of phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 25 mmHEPES, 5% dialyzed horse serum, and 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. 50 μCi of [32P]orthophosphate was added to medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in the absence of CO2. H7 (Seikagaku Kogyo) or other inhibitors were added 30 min prior stimulation with 5 ng/ml NGF for 15 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2 mm PMSF, scraped into tubes, and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 5 min. Cells were resuspend in 1 ml of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 1 mmCaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25m sucrose, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.5% Triton X-100, homogenized with Dounce homogenizer, and centrifuged at 800 ×g for 5 min. Nuclei pellets were washed once with 1 ml of the above buffer lacking Triton X-100. Pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.2 mmPMSF, and 12.5% glycerol and treated with 10 μg of DNase and RNase on ice for 30 min. Nuclei were lysed by adding 100 μl of 2% SDS, boiled for 3 min, and centrifuged at 15,600 × g for 3 min to remove debri. Nuclei extracts (15 μl/lane) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (5% polyacrylamide stacking gel containing 125 mmTris-Cl (pH 6.8), 0.1% SDS; 5% polyacrylamide resolving gel (prepared from 29.5% acrylamide + 0.5% bisacrylamide stock solution) containing 375 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.8), 0.1% SDS; running buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS). Electrophoresis was carried out at 25 mA per gel until the tracking dye entered the resolving gel, after which the current was increased to 45 mA per gel. Proteins were then electrophoretically blotted (0.5 A, 45 min) onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ImmobilonTM transfer membrane, Millipore) using a Nihon Eido Western blotting apparatus (20 × 20 cm) in buffer containing 100 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol, and 0.02% SDS. Following transfer, the membranes were blocked by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% skim milk and 0.5% Tween 20 overnight at room temperature. Phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography using Fuji RX-U x-ray film. The membranes were then exposed to 0.02 μg/ml antibodies that recognize the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (C-21, catalog number sc-900, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% skim milk and 0.05% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature, washed 3 times (10 min each) with buffer, and incubated in buffer containing anti-rabbit IgG antibodies cross-linked with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, catalog number 111-035-003; 5000-fold final dilution) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing 3 times for 20 min/wash and 3 times for 10 min/wash with buffer, immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As shown in Fig. 1, levels of both zif268 and c-fos mRNAs are low or undetectable in unstimulated cells but increase rapidly following exposure to NGF or carbachol, reaching high levels after 45 min. The fact that NGF-stimulated increases in zif268and c-fos mRNA are blocked by the inhibitor K252a (19Knusel B. Hefti F. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar,20Berg M.M. Sternberg D.W. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that these inductions require the activation of the tyrosine kinase of the high affinity NGF receptor, TrkA. Likewise, the ability of atropine to block the inductions of zif268and c-fos mRNAs by carbachol indicates the involvement of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Pretreatment of the cells for 30 min with 100 μm H7 completely blocks the induction ofzif268 and c-fos mRNAs by NGF and carbachol. By contrast, pretreatment with 100 μm HA1004 has essentially no effect on these inductions. Neither H7 nor HA1004 affect background levels of zif268 and c-fos mRNAs.3 As shown in Fig.2, H7 blocks the induction ofzif268 and c-fos mRNAs in a dose-dependent manner, with complete inhibition observed at concentrations of 50 μm and greater.Figure 2H7 inhibits the induction ofzif268 and c-fos gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis of zif268 and c-fos mRNA in PC12D cells pretreated with water (W), HA1004, or H7. PC12D cells were preincubated with the indicated concentrations of HA1004 or H7 for 30 min prior to stimulation with 5 ng/ml NGF (left) or 100 μm carbachol (right) for 45 min. These data are representative of experiments performed 3 times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The complete inhibition of zif268 and c-fos mRNA inductions by H7 is surprising for two reasons. First, although NGF has previously been reported to activate PKC in PC12 cells (21Hama T. Huang K.P. Guroff G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8646-8652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the inductions of zif268and c-fos mRNAs were not expected to require the activation of PKC, since down-regulation of PKC by prolonged exposure to phorbol ester has only a small effect on the induction of these mRNAs by NGF. 4T. Ebihara and D. Saffen, unpublished observations. We have also previously observed (5Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that induction of zif268mRNA by NGF is not affected by the specific PKC inhibitor GF109203x (23Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9194-9197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Second, although we have previously shown that PKC contributes to m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated induction of zif268 mRNA in PC12D cells, this induction is only partially blocked by pretreatment with GF109203x (5Ebihara T. Saffen D. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1001-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, the total block of zif268and c-fos gene induction by H7 seems to be too large an effect. To understand better how H7 blocks gene expression, we examined its effect on the induction of zif268 and c-fos mRNAs by additional agents. Phorbol ester is expected to stimulate increases in immediate-early gene mRNA by activating PKC, and therefore this induction would be expected be inhibited by H7. By contrast, activation of immediate-early gene expression by elevated level of intracellular Ca2+ in PC12 cells has not previously been suggested to require PKC. Rather, activation of Ca2+/calmodulin kinases (25Enslen H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20872-20877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Johnson C.M. Hill C.S. Chawla S. Treisman R. Bading H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6189-6202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or activation of MAPK cascade (27Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is thought to be sufficient. Similarly, forskolin, which increases intracellular levels of cAMP by stimulating adenylate cyclase, is thought to activate gene expression via activation of PKA (29Meinkoth J.L. Alberts A.S. Went W. Fantozzi D. Taylor S.S. Hagiwara M. Montminy M. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1993; 127/128: 179-186Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and/or the MAPK cascade (30Frodin M. Peraldi P.

The experiment depicted in Fig.3, however, shows that H7 inhibits the induction of zif268 and c-fos mRNAs by each of these agents. These results strongly suggest that H7 blocks gene expression by acting at a site distinct from PKC. MAPK is likely to play a central role in the induction of zif268 and c-fos by NGF and carbachol in PC12 cells. MAPK functions as part of the Ras/MAPK cascade (Ras-Raf-MEK-MAPK), which transmits signals from tyrosine kinase- and G protein-linked membrane receptors to the nucleus (6Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 34Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar, 35Sugden P.H. Clerk A. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 337-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Activated MAPK enters the nucleus where it phosphorylates and activates “ternary complex” transcription factors, e.g. Elk-1 or SAP-1, which stimulate gene expression by forming a complex with serum response factor bound to the serum response element (SRE) (36Gille H.

It remained unclear, however, whether this represents the only or the optimal binding site for this receptor. Therefore, we performed a DNA binding site selection assay that allows the identification of novel DNA binding sites for OR1 in an unbiased manner. While OR1 alone was not able to select a specific sequence from the pool of oligonucleotides, the OR1/RXR heterodimer selected a highly conserved DR1 element, termed DR1s, with two AGGTCA motifs spaced by one adenosine. The functional activity of the consensus binding site was verified in transient transfection assays and corroborated byin vitro studies. Based on the sequence of the consensus DR1s, we located putative natural binding sites in the 5′-promoter flanking regions of the rat S14 gene and the rat cholecystokinin type A receptor gene. Furthermore, we could show that although the OR1/RXR heterodimer has a distinct binding orientation on a DR4 element, it is able to bind in both orientations to the DR1s element. The OR1 paralog LXRα does not bind as a heterodimer with RXR to the DR1s element, indicating that these receptors, despite their homology, are involved in the regulation of different sets of genes.

Important members of this family are the steroid hormone receptors, the thyroid hormone receptor (TR),1 the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), the retinoid X receptor (RXR), the vitamin D receptor (VDR), and an increasing number of orphan receptors for which a ligand has not yet been identified. All members of this family share a common modular structure consisting of four domains (5Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). A highly conserved DNA binding domain (DBD) forms a two zinc finger structure, which is involved in specific DNA binding and protein-protein interactions (6Glass C.K. Endocr.

The C-terminal ligand binding domain, which is moderately conserved among the members of the family, is involved in ligand binding and receptor dimerization and contains transactivation and/or repression functions (8Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 9Zhang X.K. Wills K.N. Graupner G. Tzuhman M. Hermann T. Pfahl M.

The N-terminal parts of these proteins vary highly both in length and sequence and often contain a transactivation domain (11Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29821-29828Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The function of the hinge region that separates the DNA binding and the ligand binding domain is not yet fully understood but might involve interactions with regulatory proteins (13Hörlein A.J. Näär A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Söderström M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Nuclear receptors control transcription of their target genes by interacting with specific DNA sequences termed hormone response elements (6Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1131-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). All nuclear receptors recognize a minimal 6-base pair sequence (AGGTCA or AGAACA) referred to as a consensus half site motif. The primary determinant to discriminate between these two motifs is the P-box (15Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), a 6-amino acid sequence at the C-terminal base of the first zinc finger. To achieve high affinity binding and specificity for target genes, most receptors bind as dimers to DNA. The steroid hormone receptors interact as homodimers with their cognate DNA binding sites, usually palindromic repeats spaced by 3 nucleotides. In contrast, members of the thyroid/retinoid receptor subgroup bind most efficiently as heterodimers with RXR to direct or inverted repeat elements of the AGGTCA type. Both spacing of the half sites and surrounding nucleotides are crucial determinants for the specificity of binding. Thus, elements spaced by 1–5 nucleotides are bound by different subsets of heterodimers (16Umesono K. Murakami K.K. Thompson C.C. Evans R.M.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5029-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Since direct repeats are asymmetric elements, binding of RXR heterodimers occurs in an asymmetric arrangement in which RXR usually occupies the 5′-half site (19Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 20Zechel C. Shen X.-Q. Chen J.-Y. Chen Z.-P. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this polarity of binding is reversed in heterodimers binding to DR1 elements (21DiRenzo J. Söderström M.

Some receptors that bind as monomers to DNA display an increased binding affinity for a single half site caused by an C-terminal extension, also referred to as A-box, at the end of the second conserved zinc finger. This motif contacts base pairs 5′ of the upstream half site, usually an A/T rich sequence, which thus can form part of the recognition sequence (23Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J. Science. 1992; 256: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 24Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Milbrandt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5794-5804Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Another subgroup of receptors is able to bind as homodimers to direct or inverted repeats (25Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O′Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Chem.

RXR binds to direct repeats spaced by 1 base pair utilizing a third helix, also known as the T-box, that is located immediately downstream of the second zinc finger (28Lee M.S. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Wright P.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Several receptors are able to bind to more than one DNA binding site and in variable configurations, often displaying differential activation properties with the differential binding behavior (18Mader S.

In contrast, LXRα shows a more restricted expression pattern, with the highest expression levels in metabolically active organs, such as liver, intestine, and adrenals (35Apfel R. Benbrook D.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1033-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). An important step toward the understanding of the physiological functions of OR1 and LXRα was the observation that both receptors are activated by various oxysterols (38Janowski B.A. Willy P.J.

These compounds have important functions in cholesterol homeostasis and constitute precursors in the biosynthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids (40Lund E. Björkhem I. Acc. Chem.

These findings led to the suggestion that at least LXRα acts as a sensor for cholesterol derivatives and directly connects cholesterol homeostasis and gene regulation (38Janowski B.A. Willy P.J.

This hypothesis has recently been corroborated in a study on LXRα-deficient mice, which were no longer able to dispose excess cholesterol from the diet via bile acid excretion (43Peet D.J.

The rationale given for these results was the failure of LXRα mediated induction of the 7α hydroxylase (CYP7A) gene, which encodes the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (39Lehmann J.M.

The P-box sequence of both OR1 and LXRα identifies them as members of the TR/RAR subgroup of nuclear receptors. The receptors have been shown to form heterodimers with RXR on AGGTCA half sites spaced by 4 nucleotides, but also by 2 or 5 nucleotides, in gel shift analysis (31Teboul M. Enmark E. Wikström A.C.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both OR1/RXR and LXRα/RXR heterodimers confer not only constitutive activation on a DR4 element but are also inducible by the respective ligands, oxysterols, and 9-cis-retinoic acid, the ligand for RXR, enabling these receptors to simultaneously respond to a whole subset of different signals (31Teboul M.

In an effort to identify new target genes for OR1, we decided to determine the optimal DNA binding site for OR1 without the bias introduced by known or consensus elements. Therefore we used a selection and amplification technique that allows identification of high affinity binding sites from a pool of random oligonucleotides. Interestingly, we found that the OR1/RXR heterodimer preferentially binds to a DR1 type element, termed DR1s, and provide evidence that the selected consensus sequence is able to mediate transactivation of a reporter gene upon coexpression of the respective receptors. A data base search based on the selected DNA sequence located putative response elements in the 5′-promoter flanking regions of several genes. Oligonucleotides containing these potential targets efficiently compete with binding of the OR1/RXR heterodimer to the selected DR1s. Moreover, we report the first example of an RXR-containing heterodimer that is able to bind in both orientations to a direct repeat. These results suggest that OR1 might play a central role in multiple hormonal signaling pathways by responding to various signals and binding to different subsets of genes. His6-tagged proteins were expressed in the pET3a vector (Novagen) modified as follows: pET3a-OR1 expresses full-length OR1 fused to the amino acid sequence MHHHHHHIEGR, including 6 histidines and a factor Xa cleavage site. The vector pET3a-ΔNOR1 is an analogous construct that lacks codons 7–74 of OR1. Full-length RXR (pET3a-RXR) is preceded by the same sequence as in pET3a-OR1, and the analogous construct pET3a-ΔNRXR was obtained by deleting codons 11–111 of RXR. Vector sequences obtained by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing or replaced by template material. The same plasmids were used for in vitro transcription/translation from the T7 promoter in the pET3a-vector. 2DR1s-thymidine kinase (TK)-LUC contains two copies of the sequence TAAAGGTCAAAGGTCAAGT spaced by 5 nucleotides in front of the TK-LUC vector. This reporter vector is a derivative of pGL3-Basic (Promega) in which aBglII/HindIII fragment of the TK promoter has been inserted. For expression of the receptors in CHO-K1 cells, cDNA fragments encoding full-length proteins were subcloned in the pCMX-vector (kindly provided by D. Mangelsdorf) under control of the CMV promoter. The empty vector was used as a control. pCMV5-SRC1 was derived from a gift of B. W. O'Malley and as described by Onateet al. (46Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O′Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar) but in vector pCMV5. E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS, freshly transformed with one of the expression vectors, was grown at 30 °C in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1% casamino acids, 0.002% thiamin B1, 300 μg/ml ampicillin and 72 μg/ml chloramphenicol to anA 600 of approximately 0.6, induced with 1 mm IPTG and harvested after 2–3 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and broken in a French press. Cell debris was sedimented by centrifugation at 16.000 × g for 15 min and the supernatant applied on a TALON affinity column (CLONTECH) that was run on a Biologic Chromatography System (Bio-Rad). The column was washed with 5–10 mm imidazole in Buffer A, and the proteins were eluted either in a linear or in a step gradient with a final concentration of 500 mm imidazole in Buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; pure fractions were combined, and the protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 50% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and stored at −80 °C. In vitro transcription and translation was performed with the TNT-T7 rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as recommended by the manufacturer. The integrity of all proteins was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using [35S]methionine in the protocol. The amplification and binding selection method was modified as described by Alex et al. (Ref. 47Alex R. Sözeri O. Meyer S. Dildrop R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2257-2263Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and references therein). The oligonucleotide pools N20 or 2N10 consist of the following sequences: GGCTCAGCGAATTCCGTTGACC(N)20GGTCTACGGGATCCGAGTGACC or GGCTCAGCGAATTCCGTTGACC(N)10AGGTCA(N)10GGTCTACGGGATCCGAGTGACC. The flanking sequences contain an EcoRI andBamHI restriction site used for subcloning and primer binding sites for PCR amplification. Single stranded oligonucleotides were made double strand by PCR. 2 ng of either pool of oligonucleotides was incubated with 200 ng of total protein in a binding reaction mix containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 100 ng poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction volume was increased to 100 μl, and the mixture was filtered through cellulose nitrate filters (0.45-μm pore size, Schleicher & Schuell). Filters were washed five times with 200 μl of binding buffer, dried, and boiled in 300 μl of water to elute bound oligonucleotides. 30 μl of this solution was used as a template for PCR amplification and approximately 2 ng of the amplified product was used for the next round of selection. After six rounds of filter binding and PCR amplification the selected oligonucleotides were labeled in a standard PCR containing 5 ng of template and [α-32P]dCTP and subsequently used as a probe in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). The observed retarded DNA-protein complexes were cut out of the dried gel, and the DNA was eluted overnight in elution buffer (300 mmNaCl, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The eluted DNA was reamplified by PCR and either subcloned directly in a T-vector (pCRTM 2.1, Invitrogen) or cut withEcoRI/BamHI prior to subcloning in pBluescript SK (Stratagene). The subcloned oligonucleotides were then sequenced with the dideoxy chain termination method using the T7 sequencing kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes for EMSAs were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by Klenow enzyme and purified from a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Approximately 0.5 ng (10–20.000 cpm) of the probe was used in a binding reaction with 2–5 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 100 ng poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) and 100 ng of single strand DNA as unspecific competitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and specific competitor or antibodies as indicated. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature and subsequently run on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (Tris-borate-EDTA) at 4 °C. CHO K1 cells were plated in 6-well dishes containing Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with l-glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After approximately 24 h, cells were transfected with a total of 500 ng of expression vector DNA and 1 μg of reporter plasmid DNA using DOTAP reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After 4–5 h, medium was exchanged, and inducer was added as indicated (9-cis-retinoic acid was used at a final concentration of 1 μm, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol at a final concentration of 5 μm). Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity. Each experiment was done in duplicates and was performed at least three times. To select specific binding sites for the nuclear receptor OR1 in an unbiased way, we chose a strategy that combined several rounds of selection via filter binding and subsequent amplification via PCR with a final selection step using EMSA (Fig. 1 and see under “Experimental Procedures”). It had already been established that OR1 binds as a heterodimer with RXR to DR4, like response elements that contain the consensus core motif AGGTCA. On this basis, we screened a mixture of oligonucleotides that contained one AGGTCA core motif flanked by 10 random nucleotides on each side (2N10), as well as a pool of oligonucleotides containing 20 random nucleotides (N20), giving room for two half sites spaced by, at most, 6 nucleotides. For the selection, we used modified proteins for the following reasons: full-length RXR expressed in E. coli is unstable and often results in specific degradation products due to degradation signals in the amino terminus of the protein (48Chen Z.-P. Shemshedini L. Durand B. Noy N. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar problems arose when we expressed full-length OR1 in E. coli. Therefore, we constructed expression vectors for both proteins that lack the corresponding sequences in the N terminus, resulting in more stable and soluble products (ΔNOR1 and ΔNRXR, Fig. 1 B). In EMSAs, we could detect a specific complex already after two rounds of subsequent filter binding and PCR amplification using the pool of 2N10 oligonucleotides that contain one AGGTCA motif (Fig.2, lanes 4–6). This complex increased in strength in the following selection cycles, whereas a second, unspecific complex diminished with every round of selection. A similar specific complex was also observed using the pool of N20 oligonucleotides bearing a random sequence, although its appearance was delayed by two rounds of selection (data not shown). After six rounds of selection, a strong complex was formed in EMSAs (Fig. 2, lanes 7–9) from which the DNA was recovered by elution and then subcloned and sequenced as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As it has not been established whether or not OR1 might bind as a monomer or homodimer to DNA, the same approach as described above was also performed with OR1 protein alone. After six rounds of selection, no specific complex was obtained in EMSAs, indicating that OR1 is not able to bind to DNA on its own under the conditions employed,i.e. without a ligand present in the binding reaction (data not shown). We sequenced 50 and 30 subcloned binding sites derived from the pool of AGGTCA-containing and random oligonucleotides, respectively. Only independent, unique clones, as judged by the unselected and thus random sequences surrounding the binding site, were further analyzed. About 20% of the sequenced 2N10 oligonucleotides did not contain any recognizable binding site, three contained a DR4-like element, and two contained three half sites spaced by 1 and 2 base pairs, respectively. The majority of these sequences, however, contained a well conserved direct repeat spaced by one nucleotide. Alignment of the DR1 like binding sites allowed us to derive a consensus OR1/RXR binding element, from the frequency of A, C, G, and T at each position (Fig. 3). Variation from the consensus occurred basically only in the first nucleotide of the 5′ binding site, where adenosine was replaced by guanosine in about 30% of the cases. The 1-nucleotide spacer is almost exclusively an adenosine, indicating the functional importance of this nucleotide. The surrounding sequences are less well conserved but predominantly characterized by a high A/T content. Basically the same result was obtained with the pool of N20 oligonucleotides, in which approximately 50% of the sequenced oligonucleotides contained recognizable binding sites. The same consensus was derived from these sequences, although with slightly higher variation in some positions (data not shown). As the selected binding site resembles the DR1 type response element of RXR homodimers, we examined whether the sequence was in fact selected by the OR1/RXR heterodimer and not by RXR homodimers. For that purpose, we used different size receptor constructs that allowed us to discriminate between the different dimers. As shown in Fig. 4, OR1 and RXR formed a strong complex with the selected oligonucleotides regardless of which protein combination was used: full-length (lane 2), ΔN constructs (lane 5), or a mixture of both types of proteins (lanes 3 and 4). Whereas OR1 alone was unable to bind to the selected sequences (lanes 6 and8), both RXR and ΔNRXR were able to form homodimers with these elements (lanes 7 and 9). Both complexes show a different migration behavior in the gel, distinguishing them unequivocally from the heterodimeric complexes. However, weak homodimeric complexes are also visible above and below the respective heterodimer complexes (la"

Overexpression of human RFT (RFT-A) reduces FGF-2 RNA and protein levels in both normal and tumor cell lines. Its splice variants, RFT-A′ and RFT-B, have deletions in the putative DNA binding domain and fail to bind FGF-2 promoter and repress FGF-2 gene expression. The ratios of RFT isoforms differ between normal and tumor cells, with the splice variants dominating in tumor cells. Overexpression of RFT-A induces glioma cell death. Our data suggest that regulation of FGF-2 by RFT is important for cellular functions and may be impaired in certain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1981190915,"DNA binding activity and nuclear transport of B-Myb in Xenopus oocytes are negatively regulated. Two distinct sequence elements in the C-terminal portion of the protein are responsible for these different inhibitory activities. A C-terminalXenopus B-Myb protein fragment inhibits the DNA binding activity of the N-terminal repeats in trans, indicating that intramolecular folding may result in masking of the DNA binding function. Xenopus B-Myb contains two separate nuclear localization signals (NLSs), which, in Xenopus oocytes, function only outside the context of the full-length protein. Fusion of an additional NLS to the full-length protein overcomes the inhibition of nuclear import, suggesting that masking of the NLS function rather than cytoplasmic anchoring is responsible for the negative regulation of Xenopus B-Myb nuclear transfer. DuringXenopus embryogenesis, when inhibition of nuclear import is relieved, Xenopus B-mybis preferentially expressed in the developing nervous system and neural crest cells. Within the developing neural tube, Xenopus B-mybgene transcription occurs preferentially in proliferating, non-differentiated cells.

Three members of this family, termed c-Myb, A-Myb, and B-Myb, have been described in vertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 1Lipsick J.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 223-235PubMed Google Scholar). Though structurally related, these three vertebrate Myb variants appear to fulfill very different biological functions. On the basis of their expression characteristics, it has been proposed that c-Myb and A-Myb exert cell type-specific activities, whereas B-Myb seems to serve a more general function. B-myb expression in Xenopus is maternal, and transcripts can be detected throughout embryogenesis as well as in several adult tissues (2Bouwmeester T. Guehmann S. el-Baradi T. Kalkbrenner F. van Wijk I. Moelling K. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1992; 37: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The human and murine B-mybencoding genes are also widely expressed in different tissues during embryogenesis, with differential expression during testis development (3Tashiro S. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar, 4Latham K.E. Litvin J. Orth J.M. Patel B. Mettus R. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1161-1168PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Kamano H. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, B-myb expression in mammals has been linked to proliferative activity (5Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Kamano H. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier B-Myb promoter studies have already identified a negative regulatory element that is responsible for repression of B-myb transcription in G0 via the activity of the E2F DNA-binding protein (6Lam E.W. Watson R.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2705-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). B-myb expression is induced at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle (7Golay J. Capucci A. Arsura M. Castellano M. Rizzo V. Introna M. Blood. 1991; 77: 149-158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lam E.W. Robinson C. Watson R.J. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1885-1890PubMed Google Scholar, 9Arsura M. Luchetti M.M. Erba E.

Furthermore, ectopic expression of B-myb can induce DNA synthesis in certain cell types (11Sala A. Casella I. Bellon T. Calabretta B. Watson R.J. Peschle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9363-9367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that B-Myb has a general function in cell division. Mapping of functional domains in human B-Myb identified a DNA-binding domain located at the N terminus, followed by a transcriptional activation domain; it has been reported that the carboxyl portion of the human protein contains two separate nuclear localization signals (12Nakagoshi H. Takemoto Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14161-14167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Takemoto Y. Tashiro S. Handa H. Ishii S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). B-Myb can activate transcription through two very different mechanisms. The first is independent from its DNA-binding domain and operates, probably indirectly, via the heat shock element (14Kamano H. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas the second depends on the B-Myb DNA-binding domain and works on promoters that contain B-Myb DNA-binding sites (15Mizuguchi G. Nakagoshi H. Nagase T. Nomura N. Date T. Ueno Y. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9280-9284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter mechanism has been found to depend on the cell-type utilized in transient transfection studies, and this has been suggested to reflect the requirement for a specific cofactor in transactivation (3Tashiro S. Takemoto Y. Handa H. Ishii S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1699-1707PubMed Google Scholar). The direct physical interaction of B-Myb with another protein may also negatively regulate its activity; inhibition of B-Myb-dependent transactivation correlates with specific binding of p107, an Rb-related protein (11Sala A. Casella I. Bellon T. Calabretta B. Watson R.J. Peschle C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9363-9367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been demonstrated that the transactivation function of B-Myb is subject to post-translational regulation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Phosphorylation by cdk2 in the C-terminal portion of the protein is required to activate the transactivation function of full-length B-Myb (16Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalili K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Ziebold U. Bartsch O. Marais R. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A similar effect in transient transfection can be reproduced by C-terminal truncations (17Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Ziebold U. Bartsch O. Marais R. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). It therefore appears that the B-Myb C terminus negatively regulates transactivation and that this repression is relieved by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation. However, the exact molecular events that are initiated by this modification remain to be solved. We have previously described that both DNA binding activity and nuclear transfer of the full-length B-Myb protein are repressed in stage V/VIXenopus oocytes and that DNA binding activity is relieved upon C-terminal truncation of the protein. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate that maternal B-Myb becomes phosphorylated upon meiotic maturation, but that these phosphorylation events were not sufficient to activate DNA binding of the full-length Xenopus B-Myb protein (2Bouwmeester T. Guehmann S. el-Baradi T. Kalkbrenner F. van Wijk I. Moelling K. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1992; 37: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Bouwmeester T. van Wijk I. Wedlich D. Pieler T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1029-1038PubMed Google Scholar). This study elucidates the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the negative regulation of DNA binding activity and nuclear transport of Xenopus B-Myb. Deletion mutagenesis identifies two distinct elements within the C terminus of Xenopus B-Myb that are responsible for repression of DNA binding and nuclear transport, respectively. Two independent, functional nuclear localization signals were mapped in the C-terminal portion of B-Myb. We also demonstrate that the C terminus of the Xenopus B-Myb protein can inhibit the DNA binding activity of the N-terminal portion in trans. These and other observations suggest that intramolecular folding may be involved in masking DNA binding and nuclear transport activities. Analysis of the spatial expression characteristics of B-myb during Xenopusembryogenesis reveals neural specific expression and links B-myb gene transcription to proliferative activity within the developing neural tube. The plasmid pSP64T XB-Myb (2Bouwmeester T. Guehmann S. el-Baradi T. Kalkbrenner F. van Wijk I. Moelling K. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1992; 37: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was used to generate XB-Myb C-terminal mutants with theExoIII/mung bean nuclease deletion system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The corresponding mutant proteins were generated byin vitro transcription/translation for use in the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. A BamHI site upstream of the XB-myb translation start ATG was generated by PCR1 using sense (5′ GTC CGG ATC CGC AGA ATG TCC CGG CGG 3′) and antisense (5′ TAT TTC AGC CCA TCG ATT TCC CAA TAC 3′) primers. The resulting PCR fragment spanning nucleotides 46–540 of XB-myb cDNA was cloned into the pGEM-T™ vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. From this plasmid a DNA fragment derived by cutting with BamHI and ClaI was generated. In parallel a DNA fragment was generated from full-length and truncated pSP64T XB-Myb by restriction digestion usingClaI and SalI. Both fragments (BamHI-ClaI and ClaI-SalI) were used for simultaneous ligation into pGEX-5X-1 vector (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). The resulting chimera of GST and full-length or truncated XB-Myb were sequenced to confirm the in-frame fusion. These constructs were expressed in XL-1 blue Escherichia coli, followed by purification of the fusion proteins according to the procedure of Kirov (20Kirov N. Childs S. O'Connor M. Rushlow C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 713-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to prepare proteins for oocyte microinjection, the full-length and truncated DNAs were transferred into the Myc-tag vector pCS2MT (21Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1434-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar) by cutting the GST clones with BamHI/SalI, performing a fill-in reaction, and cloning intoXhoI/filled-in pCS2MT vector. Site-directed mutation of the NLS1 was generated by PCR with the sense primer (5′ TCT GTG CTG AAA CAA CAC AAC AAC AGA AAC ATT ACC CTG TCA CCT GTT ACA G 3′) and the antisense primer (5′ CTG TAA CAG GTG ACA GGG TAA TGT TTC TGT TGT TGT GTT GTT TCA GCA CAG A 3′) using the Quick Change system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All the constructs were manually sequenced using either Sequenase (U. S. Biochemicals) or an Applied Biosystems sequencing system, usingTaq dye terminator cycle sequencing. 2During the cloning procedure, we noted an error in the published sequence. This change implies an addition of 26 amino acid residues at the C terminus. The corrected sequence has been submitted to GenBank (accession number M75870). A double-stranded DNA fragment containing the Myb-specific DNA-binding motif (2Bouwmeester T. Guehmann S. el-Baradi T. Kalkbrenner F. van Wijk I. Moelling K. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1992; 37: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) was labeled by fill-in reaction using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 6.25 fmol of labeled DNA were incubated with in vitro translated proteins in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol) in a 20-μl final volume for 20 min at 25 °C. Nonspecific DNA binding was diminished by competition with both 50 ng/ml poly(dI·dC) (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and 50 ng/ml M13 single-stranded DNA. DNA binding activity was competed specifically with an 800-fold molar excess of non-labeled, double-stranded DNA fragment containing the DNA-binding motif of Myb. The complex was resolved in 8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1) gels, 0.25[time] TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris borate, pH 8.4, 1 mm EDTA) and analyzed by use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld, Germany). The combined in vitro transcription/translation (TNT) system (Promega) was used to generate the 35S-labeled in vitro translated proteins. Reactions were performed according to the Promega TNT protocol, and [35S]methionine (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) was used for radiolabeling. In vitro translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld, Germany). Oocytes were removed from adult Xenopus laevis. Stage V/VI oocytes (23Dumont J.T. J. Morphol. 1972; 136: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar) were isolated manually or by collagenase treatment (Worthington, Freeholds, NJ) and kept in normal strength modified Barth saline, 1 × MBSH (24Gurdon J.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1977; 16: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Approximately 50 nl of each of the different 35S-labeled fusion protein solutions (in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate) were injected into the cytoplasm of oocytes. After injection, the oocytes were incubated for between 2 and 20 h in 1× MBSH at 18 °C. Nuclei and cytoplasmic fractions were manually dissected in ice-cold NET-2 buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin), collected on ice (20 cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions per sample), and homogenized. The homogenates were centrifuged 3–4 times in a microcentrifuge (14,000 × g, 3 min) and the supernatant used for immunoprecipitation analysis. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation using monoclonal antibody against the 9E10 epitope of human c-Myc protein (Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA). The myc antibody was bound to Protein G-GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Pharmacia), for 2 h at room temperature in NET-2 buffer. The PGS antibody pellets were washed three times with NET-2 buffer. Subsequently, supernatants of homogenized cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions of injected oocytes (see above) were added and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitate was washed four times with NET-2 buffer, dried, and dissolved in 40 μl of SDS sample buffer. The samples were heated to 100 °C, loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed using a PhosphorImager. Whole-mountin situ hybridization was carried out according to the procedure of Harland (25Harland R.M. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 685-695Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a digoxigenin-labeled antisense XB-myb RNA probe. RNA was generated usingBsp106I-linearized pT7T3 XB-Myb and T7 RNA polymerase. For sectioning, stained and postfixed embryos were gelatin-embedded and Vibratome-sectioned at 30 μm thickness and photographed under a phase-contrast microscope. The myc-tagged in vitrotranslated proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane, probed with the human c-myc monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech) and detected using the ECL chemiluminiscent detection system (Amersham). The x-ray films were quantified using a Bio-Rad densitometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Munich, Germany). B-myb is expressed duringXenopus embryogenesis, as revealed by Northern and Western blot analysis (2Bouwmeester T. Guehmann S. el-Baradi T. Kalkbrenner F. van Wijk I. Moelling K. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1992; 37: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Bouwmeester T. van Wijk I. Wedlich D. Pieler T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1029-1038PubMed Google Scholar). In order to characterize the spatial distribution of B-myb encoding transcripts, stagedXenopus embryos were subjected to whole-mount in situ hybridization with a B-myb-specific antisense RNA probe (Fig. 1). During neurula stages, B-myb is found to be exclusively expressed within the developing central nervous system. At the open neural plate stage, B-myb-specific signals are most prominent in the eye anlagen, as well as in the anterior portion of the neural plate (Fig.1 A). Upon closure of the neural tube, B-mybcontinues to be expressed in fore-, mid-, and hindbrain, as well as in the entire optic vesicle and in neural crest cells (Fig. 1,C and E). During further development up to the tadpole stage, this pattern is generally maintained (Fig. 1,B and D). In the embryonic eye, B-mybexpression becomes restricted to the ciliary margin (Fig.1 F), a group of undifferentiated, proliferative cells that give rise to all major cell types of the retina (Fig. 1 F) (26Wetts R. Fraser S.E. Science. 1988; 4: 1142-1145Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar). A transverse section at the level of the hindbrain reveals that, within the neural tube, B-myb is preferentially expressed in the ventricular zone, which also contains proliferating, non-differentiated cells (Fig. 1 G). In summary, B-myb expression in the developingXenopus embryo is specific to the developing central nervous system and to structures derived therefrom, such as the eye and neural crest/branchial arches. As development proceeds, B-myb in both the tadpole eye and the tadpole hindbrain is found to be preferentially expressed in proliferating, non-differentiated cells. We have previously reported that full-lengthXenopus B-Myb, either as a recombinant protein isolated from bacteria, or in its native form from Xenopus oocytes and embryos, is inhibited in its DNA binding capacity. Removal of the C-terminal portion of the protein relieves this inhibition (2Bouwmeester T. Guehmann S. el-Baradi T. Kalkbrenner F. van Wijk I. Moelling K. Pieler T. Mech. Dev. 1992; 37: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19Bouwmeester T. van Wijk I. Wedlich D. Pieler T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1029-1038PubMed Google Scholar). Extending these studies, we have now generated a more systematic set of C-terminal deletion mutants of B-Myb and have assayed for their DNA binding activity in order to map the inhibitory domain more precisely. Truncated versions of XB-Myb were produced by in vitrotranslation and analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the Myb DNA-binding site (Fig. 2). Assays were performed both in the presence and in the absence of a competitor oligonucleotide encompassing the B-Myb recognition site, in order to test for specificity of complex formation. C-terminal truncations of up to 275 amino acids do not relieve inhibition of DNA binding, but deletion of 308 amino acids recovers maximal DNA binding activity. Thus, a protein element located between the amino acids in position 425 and 458 is sufficient to fully inhibit the specific DNA binding capacity of the N-terminal XB-Myb repeats; we refer to this region as the DNA-binding regulatory domain. The fact that both full-length XB-Myb from Xenopusoocytes/embryos and the recombinant, bacterially expressed protein are inactive in DNA binding had already suggested that the inhibitory mechanism does not rely on a specific corepressor protein. Alternatively, inhibition of DNA binding could be a consequence of intramolecular folding and interaction between C- and N-terminal domains of XB-Myb. We therefore tested the possibility that a C-terminally derived fragment containing the entire DNA-binding regulatory domain inhibits the DNA binding activity of the N-terminal fragment in trans. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a constant amount of the N-terminal DNA-binding domain in the presence of increasing amounts of the C-terminal fragment containing the DNA-binding regulatory domain result in gradually reduction of DNA-complex formation (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that a sequence element in XB-Myb located between residues 425 and 458 negatively regulates the DNA binding activity of XB-Myb by intramolecular folding and mediates direct interaction between N- and C-terminal domains of XB-Myb. We previously reported that neither full-length XB-Myb nor the N-terminal half of the protein are translocated to the nucleus of Xenopus oocytes (19Bouwmeester T. van Wijk I. Wedlich D. Pieler T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1029-1038PubMed Google Scholar). For a more detailed analysis, a systematic series of progressive C-terminal deletion mutants of XB-Myb was produced by in vitrotranslation and injected into the cytoplasm of stage V/VIXenopus oocytes. After 18 h of incubation, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were manually separated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.4). As reported earlier, full-length XB-Myb was not found to be imported into the nucleus, and only background levels of the protein could be recovered from the nuclear fraction (19Bouwmeester T. van Wijk I. Wedlich D. Pieler T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1029-1038PubMed Google Scholar). Our work shows that a C-terminal deletion, spanning amino acids 655–733, partially activates nuclear transport. A bigger deletion of the C terminus, encompassing amino acids 543–733, enhances nuclear transfer activity. Further removal of sequence elements containing one of two putative basic NLSs strongly reduces nuclear transport, while additional deletion of the second putative NLS fully inhibits the same process. A protein fragment containing both of the putative NLSs but lacking the C-terminal negative regulatory domain, as well as the N-terminal half of XB-Myb, carries full nuclear import activity. The activity of the two putative NLSs was therefore analyzed in more detail. Kinetic analysis of the nuclear import with XB-Myb lacking the C-terminal inhibitory domain reveals a significant level of nuclear transfer even after 2 h (Fig. 5). Conversely, mutation of NLS1 or deletion of NLS2 results in significantly reduced import kinetics. Site-directed mutagenesis of NLS1 in a deletion mutant that already lacks NLS2 leads to a further reduction of import to background levels. Taken together, these observations define two physically separate, but functionally cooperative, nuclear localization signals in XB-Myb, which are negatively regulated by the C-terminal portion of the protein. The experiments on the regulation of B-Myb DNA binding activity described above argued for an intramolecular interaction of N- and C-terminal portions of the protein that might directly involve the DNA-binding N-terminal repeats. If such an interaction were to occur, it could also be responsible for the inhibition of nuclear transfer, for example by masking the NLS function. To test this possibility, the XB-Myb internal fragment sufficient for efficient nuclear transfer (residues 349–545, Fig. 4) was characterized in further detail. The molecular mass of the corresponding protein (roughly 46 kDa) is within the protein size range that is believed to allow passive nuclear import by diffusion. However, its import is strongly temperature-dependent (Fig.6 A), arguing for the existence of an active import mechanism. Fusion of the C-terminal transport regulatory domain completely ablates import in a manner similar to TFIIIA, which is used as a cytoplasmic retention control (Fig.6 B). This finding demonstrates that the N-terminal half of XB-Myb bearing the DNA-binding domains is not required for the inhibition of nuclear import and is therefore not likely to be involved in masking of the XB-Myb NLS function. We further investigated the molecular mechanism responsible for the negative regulation of Xenopus B-Myb nuclear transport. Two principal modes of inhibition were considered, one involving interaction of the nuclear transport regulatory domain with a cytoplasmic anchor, and a second one relying on either masking of the NLS function via interaction with a molecule that is physically distinct from B-Myb, or via intramolecular folding. If an anchoring mechanism is responsible for cytoplasmic retention of B-Myb, transfer of the nuclear transport regulatory domain to a different nuclear protein constitutively imported in Xenopusoocytes should result in its cytoplasmic retention. In order to test this possibility, ribosomal protein L5, which is constitutively transported to the nucleus in Xenopus oocytes (27Rudt F. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), was fused to either full-length or truncated versions of XenopusB-Myb. All of these constructs are imported into the nucleus after injection into the cytoplasm of Xenopus oocytes (Fig.7). These findings demonstrate the dominance of a functional NLS over the cytoplasmic retention domain. It is therefore unlikely that interaction of the nuclear transport regulatory domain with a cytoplasmic anchor is responsible for the cytoplasmic sequestration of full-length Xenopus B-Myb as observed in Xenopus oocytes. We report herein on the expression of B-myb duringXenopus embryogenesis and on the protein domains involved in DNA binding and nuclear transport, two aspects related to the regulation of XB-Myb function in transcription. The C-terminal portion of Xenopus B-Myb contains two distinct sequence elements responsible for the negative regulation of DNA binding and nuclear transport activities, respectively. The region between amino acid residues 425 and 458 is involved in the inhibition of DNA binding, presumably through intramolecular interaction between the N and C termini. The last 88 amino acid residues of the C terminus (TRD) negatively regulate nuclear transfer; this inhibition is likely to involve masking of the two separate NLSs, either by intra- or by intermolecular interactions. Expression of XB-myb is preferentially detected in proliferating, non-differentiated neural cells in the developingXenopus embryo. This correlates with the bona fide function of XB-Myb in cell division, as has been proposed for mammalian B-Myb (28Raschellà G. Negroni A. Sala A. Pucci S. Romeo A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8540-8545Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In mouse, B-myb is also mainly expressed in the developing central nervous system, especially in highly proliferating cells (5Sitzmann J. Noben-Trauth K. Kamano H. Klempnauer K.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1889-1894PubMed Google Scholar). XB-myb is expressed initially as a continuous unit in the anterior neural plate, later becoming more strongly expressed in the lateral regions of the anterior neural plate and fading from the median region. These two domains of expression will give raise to the eye primordia (29Li H. Tierney C. Wen L. Wu J. Rao Y. Development. 1997; 124: 603-615PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of XB-myb in the developing eye anlage correlates with those of Pax 6 (30Callaerts P. Halder G. Gehring W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 483-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and ET (29Li H. Tierney C. Wen L. Wu J. Rao Y. Development. 1997; 124: 603-615PubMed Google Scholar). Studies involving these genes have shown the existence of a single retina field, which splits into two distinct primordia (29Li H. Tierney C. Wen L. Wu J. Rao Y. Development. 1997; 124: 603-615PubMed Google Scholar). Sections of neurula-stage embryos show that XB-myb is initially detected in the whole retinal neuroepithelium. At later stages it becomes restricted to the cells of the retinal ciliary margin, the multipotent retinal progenitor cells (26Wetts R. Fraser S.E. Science. 1988; 4: 1142-1145Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar). It remains to be demonstrated whether XB-Myb also regulates retinal proliferation. We show that a serine/threonine-rich region (amino acids 369–545) that includes two NLSs is required for efficient nuclear import of XB-Myb and the negative regulation of DNA binding. This region is highly conserved among Myb family members, including human, mouse,Xenopus, and chicken B-Myb, implying that it has a conserved function. Such a domain is a potential target of phosphorylation, and it displays two ankyrin-like repeats (31Lux S.F. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). The ankyrin motif has been related to both cell cycle control and differentiation (31Lux S.F. John K.M. Bennett V. Nature. 1990; 344: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and these repeats have also been implicated in protein-protein interactions (32Kieran M. Blank V. Logeat F. Vandekerckhove J. Lottspeich F. Le Bail O. Urban M. Kourilsky P. Baeuerle P. Israël A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1007-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Such interactions have indeed been shown in mammalian cells in culture for c-Myb (33Favier D. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar), and in Xenopus oocytes for B-Myb. 3G. Humbert-Lan and T. Pieler, unpublished results. The region responsible for DNA binding inhibition lies at the C terminus of XB-Myb (amino acids 425–458). Several observations on the activation of B-Myb correlate with results obtained for the regulation of c-Myb activities. Deletion of the C terminus of c-Myb increases its transcriptional activation capacity (34Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 35Kalkbrenner F. Guehmann S. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 6657-6661Google Scholar, 36Dubendorff J.W. Whittaker L.J. Eltman J.T. Lipsick J.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2524-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, the suppressor activity of the negative regulatory domain in c-Myb functions in cis and in trans (36Dubendorff J.W. Whittaker L.J. Eltman J.T. Lipsick J.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2524-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The negative regulatory function of the C terminus in B-Myb has been detected at different levels of B-Myb activity. The transactivation potential of B-Myb in transient transfection assays has been found to be inhibited in several cell lines. The inhibition can be relieved either by introducing C-terminal truncations or by coactivation of the cell cycle-regulated protein kinase cdk2, which appears to use the C terminus of B-Myb as a direct substrate (16Sala A. Kundu M. Casella I. Engelhard A. Calabretta B. Grasso L. Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Watson R.J. Khalili K. Peschle C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 532-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Lane S. Farlie P. Watson R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 18Ziebold U. Bartsch O. Marais R. Ferrari S. Klempnauer K.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 253-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We previously reported that maternal Xenopus B-Myb became hyperphosphorylated upon meiotic maturation of oocytes, but that this did not affect binding to DNA (19Bouwmeester T. van Wijk I. Wedlich D. Pieler T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1029-1038PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that the C-terminal portion of Xenopus B-Myb inhibits the DNA binding activity of the N-terminal portion in trans supports a model whereby a direct intramolecular interaction is responsible for the negative regulation of DNA-complex formation observed. This mechanism would not require additional factors interacting with the DNA-binding regulatory domain, although some of the interacting factors observed for XB-Myb in oocytes3 might function in the relief of inhibition and promote transcriptional activation later on in embryogenesis. Intramolecular inhibition of DNA binding has been described for other proteins. An excellent example is the study of the Ets family of transcription factors. DNA binding by Ets-1 is prevented by intramolecular interactions involving the N terminus, the ETS domain, and nearby sequences. DNA-binding inhibition is relieved by conformational changes that occur in the presence of DNA. These changes are thought to promote cooperative binding of a stabilizing protein partner (37Jonsen M.D. Petersen J.M. Xu Q.P. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 38Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although intramolecular interactions participate in DNA-binding inhibition of XB-Myb, in contrast to Ets-1, the inhibition takes place even in presence of the DNA target. Our results open the way for further investigations about the nature of positive regulation of B-Myb mediated by a protein partner or by posttranslational modifications. In full-grown oocytes XB-Myb is cytoplasmic, and during embryogenesis XB-Myb localizes in the nucleus. We analyzed the mechanism of negative regulation of XB-Myb in oocytes that would prevent XB-Myb functioning as a transcription factor. We have shown that the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of XB-Myb involves at least two different protein elements: the TRD, responsible for the cytoplasmic retention of the protein, and two NLSs, which are necessary for efficient nuclear import of XB-Myb. Our data suggest that both NLSs are functionally cooperative and would be the bona fide domains involved in nuclear import in the embryo. According to our data, the molecular mechanism responsible for the negative regulation of XB-Myb nuclear targeting in oocytes is likely to involve masking of the NLS. We showed the dominance of an additional NLS over the TRD in the full-length protein, indicating that the extra signal promotes XB-Myb nuclear entry. This finding excludes the possibility of a cytoplasmic anchoring mechanism. Thus, the retention of XB-Myb in the oocyte cytoplasm could be mediated either by intra- or intermolecular interactions that mask the NLS. If the NLS function in Xenopus B-Myb is inhibited by interaction with other proteins that mask the B-Myb NLSs, such interacting proteins should be present in Xenopus oocyte extracts. As an initial step toward the identification of such interacting proteins, radiolabeled oocyte proteins were incubated with full-length and truncated versions of immobilized XenopusB-Myb. Putative inhibitors should bind to full-length or shortened versions of Xenopus B-Myb that were not able to travel to the nuclear compartment, as analyzed in the oocyte injection assays (see above). Such experiments do indeed detect proteins that interact with a recombinant Xenopus B-Myb/GST fusion, but not with the GST extension alone. However, there was no clear correlation between inhibition of nuclear transfer and binding of any of these proteins (data not shown). B-Myb phosphorylation could be part of the mechanism that regulates DNA binding and/or nuclear transfer, two activities that define prerequisites for transcription activation by B-Myb. However, phosphorylation of B-Myb during oocyte maturation was not found to be sufficient to activate the DNA binding activity of B-Myb (19Bouwmeester T. van Wijk I. Wedlich D. Pieler T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1029-1038PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the distribution of B-Myb between nucleus and cytoplasm does not correlate with cell cycle activities (39Robinson C. Light Y. Groves R. Mann D. Marais R. Watson R. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1855-1864PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of B-Myb as a transcriptional activator is not likely to be due to a simple, phosphorylation-mediated switch between binding and not binding to B-Myb-dependent promoters, or between cytoplasmic and nuclear localization, but seems to rely on a more complex mechanism. This mechanism might involve all three processes. Further investigation will elucidate the role of hyperphosphorylation in the regulation of XB-Myb activities.

https://openalex.org/W2089184383,"Abstract Expression of yeast genes involved in one-carbon metabolism is controlled by glycine, byl-methionine, and by nitrogen sources. Here we report a novel control element containing a core CTTCTT motif mediating the glycine response, demonstrating that a protein binds this element, that binding is modulated by tetrahydrofolate, and that folate is required for the in vivo glycine response. In an heterologousCYC1 promoter the region needed for the glycine response ofGCV2 (encoding the P-subunit of glycine decarboxylase) mediated repression that was relieved by glycine. It was also responsible for l-methionine control but not nitrogen repression. GCV1 and GCV3 have an homologous region in their promoters. The GCV1 region conferred a glycine response on an heterologous promoter acting as a repressor or activator depending on promoter context. A protein was identified that bound to the glycine regulatory regions of GCV1and GCV2 only if the CTTCTT motif was intact. This protein protected a 17-base pair CATCN7CTTCTT region of GCV2 that is conserved between GCV1 and GCV2. Protein binding was increased by tetrahydrofolate, and use of a fol1 deletion mutant indicated the involvement of a folate in the in vivoglycine response. Tetrahydrofolate or a derivative may act as a ligand for the transcription factor controlling expression of one-carbon metabolism genes."

These tumor antigens are potential therapeutical agents for cancer immunotherapy, and some of them, under different forms, are currently assayed in vivo (5Boon T. Int. J.

MHC class I-restricted antigenic peptides have been tested for in vivo vaccination trials in animal models and in humans (6Melief C.J. Offringa R. Toes R.E. Kast W.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The use of peptides offers a number of advantages, especially those of a highly specific response and a very low toxicity (7Jaeger E. Bernhard H. Romero P. Ringhoffer M. Arand M. Karbach J. Ilsemann C. Hagedorn M. Knuth A. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 66: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, the results obtained with such peptide vaccines have been variable, dependent on a number of factors (6Melief C.J. Offringa R. Toes R.E. Kast W.M. Curr. Opin.

Indeed, the major factor limiting the efficiency of peptide vaccinesin vivo is, in most cases, their rapid degradation in serum and other biological fluids (13Powell M.F. Grey H. Gaeta F. Sette A.

Peptides presented naturally by MHC class I molecules after intracellular processing of endogenous proteins were shown to be protected, by the MHC, against further protease degradation (15Ojcius D.M. Langlade-Demoyen P. Gachelin G. Kourilsky P. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2798-2810PubMed Google Scholar, 16Malarkannan S. Goth S. Buchholz D.R. Shastri N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 585-598PubMed Google Scholar). When exogenous peptides are used for vaccination, they may be degraded by extracellular proteases before reaching, and binding to, MHC molecules. Presentation of exogenous peptides by MHC molecules might be altered by the presence of serum proteases (14Falo L.D.J. Colarusso L.J. Benacerraf B. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A correlation was found between peptide stability in vitro in serum and peptide persistence in vivo, in ascitic fluid as well as on the surface of cells presenting the peptide (18Widmann C. Maryanski J.L. Romero P. Corradin G. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 3745-3751PubMed Google Scholar). The stability of peptides in biological media must therefore be taken into account in the design of synthetic peptide vaccines, and the development of non-natural peptide antigens may be of great interest. However, the major difficulty in the design of such modified peptides lies in the fact that the structural modifications introduced must not induce a loss in the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the peptide. Indeed, the activity of an antigenic peptide depends upon two critical steps: (i) its presentation by the MHC, determined by the anchor positions (19Barinaga M.

Encoded by the MAGE-1 gene expressed in 40% of melanomas but not in normal tissues (testis excepted) (2van der Bruggen P. Traversari C. Chomez P. Lurquin C. De Plaen E. Van den Eynde B. Knuth A.

Its anchor positions are Asp (D)3 and Tyr (Y)9 (31DiBrino M. Parker K.C. Shiloach J. Turner R.V. Tsuchida T. Garfield M. Biddison W.E. Coligan J.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 620-631PubMed Google Scholar). The residues of MAGE-1.A1 recognized by the different anti-MAGE-1.A1 CTL clones are located at P1 and in the P4–P8 domain (32Romero P. Pannetier C. Herman J. Jongeneel C.V. Cerottini J.C. Coulie P.G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1019-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Analysis of the structural parameters involved in the degradation mechanism in serum of MAGE-1.A1 and in its interactions with the MHC on one side and the TcR on the other allowed us to design stable and biologically active non natural MAGE-1.A1 analogues. Peptides were synthesized by the solid-phase method using FMOC chemistry. FMOC aa derivatives were purchased from Bachem, France. The non natural N- or α-methylated aa derivatives were coupled usingO-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate instead of 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate used for natural aa derivatives. Peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on reversed-phase columns (RP300-C8 Brownlee Lab and an Applied Biosystems 130 apparatus). The purity of all peptides was >98%. The identity of the purified peptides was confirmed by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. Stock solutions (2 × 10−3m in H2O) were prepared and stored at −20 °C. The TAP−BM36.1 (45Kelly A. Powis S.H. Kerr L.A. Mockridge I. Elliott T. Bastin J. Uchanska Z.B. Ziegler A. Trowsdale J. Townsend A. Nature. 1992; 355: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) and the TAP+ BM21 EBV-transformed lymphomas (HLA-A1, B35, Cw4), were used in MHC stabilization experiments and CTL assays, respectively. They were grown in RPMI medium supplemented with 8% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Melanoma cell line MZ2-MEL (derived from patient MZ2), LG2-EBV, and CTL clones 82/30, 253/47, and 258/8 were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 10% human serum. CTL clones were stimulated weekly with MZ2-MEL cell line in the presence of LG2-EBV as feeder cells and human interleukin-2 as described previously (46Traversari C. van der Bruggen P. Van den Eynde B. Hainaut P. Lemoine C. Ohta N. Old L. Boon T. Immunogenetics. 1992; 35: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Peptides were added to preheated (15 min at 37 °C before the assay) human serum to a final concentration of 10−3m and incubated at 37 °C. Human sera were obtained by centrifugation at 2000 ×g of blood samples of five healthy donors. MAGE-1.A1 degradation in individual sera was qualitatively and quantitatively identical. All sera were pooled, and subsequent degradation experiments were realized in the pool. At different incubation times, an aliquot (150 μl) was removed and the protease and peptidase activities were stopped by addition of 15 μl of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Precipitated serum proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were frozen and preserved at −20 °C until analysis by off-line HPLC and/or on-line HPLC/ESI-MS. In control experiments, MAGE-1.A1 and its substituted analogues did not precipitate in presence of 10% TFA and remained stable under these acidic conditions. Serum alone was precipitated by 10% TFA, and its HPLC profile was recorded to detect peaks corresponding to non-precipitated peptides present in the serum. Peptides and their degradation products were separated by reversed-phase HPLC and peaks corresponding to the different products were quantified. Samples analysis at different incubation times allowed the study of the degradation kinetics of the peptides, determination of their half-life as well as the formation of the different degradation products. The following HPLC conditions were used: (i) ultrasphere ODS column: 5-mm, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, C18 (Beckman); (ii) gradient: 4–20% CH3CN (0.08% TFA in H2O, 0.08% TFA in CH3CN), 0–30 min; (iii) UV detection: 200–300 nm using a Waters 996 photodiode array detector; (iv) chromatograms at 225 and 280 nm were derived. The sequences of degradation fragments were determined by on-line HPLC/ESI-MS. Chromatographic conditions were the same as above except for the gradient (4–15% instead of 4–20%). MS analysis was performed with a TSQ-700 Finnigan Mat mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA). The entire HPLC flow was introduced via an atmospheric pressure ionization interface operating in ESI. The interface conditions were such that the needle voltage was maintained at 5 kV, producing a current of 70 μA. The temperature of the heated capillary was 250 °C. Nitrogen was used as both nebulizing gas (80 p.s.i.) and auxiliary gas (20 p.s.i.). MS data (positive ions) were collected in the full scale mode (m/z 150–1200) at 2 ms per step. Peptide binding to HLA-A1 was assayed using the peptide-induced MHC stabilization procedure (47Hudrisier D. Mazarguil H. Oldstone M.B.A. Gairin J.E. Mol. Immunol. 1995; 32: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using the TAP-deficient BM36.1 cell line. Briefly, cells (2 × 105/sample) were incubated with or without increasing amounts of peptide (10−9m to 10−4m for 4 h in the presence of 20% inactivated fetal calf serum as a β2-microglobulin source and peptidase inhibitors (bestatin and captopril, 10−4m). HLA-A1 molecules were detected at the cell surface by using the monoclonal antibody W6.32, which reacts with all human MHC class I alleles. After one wash with ice-cold culture medium, cells were incubated on ice for 1 h with 100 μl of W6.32 culture supernatant or with medium alone for negative control. After one wash with ice-cold 1% bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma). Cells were then washed twice, fixed with 1% formaldehyde in bovine serum albumin-phosphate-buffered saline, and analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson FACScan). For each peptide, a SC50 value (stabilizing concentration 50: concentration of peptide giving half of the maximal stabilization effect) was defined, which reflects its affinity for the studied MHC allele. Lysis of target cells by CTL clones was measured by chromium release assay. Target cells were 51Cr-labeled for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of monoclonal anti-human MHC class I antibody W6.32 and washed three times. Target cells were then incubated in V-bottom microwells (103 cells in 50 μl) in the presence of different concentrations of peptide (50 μl) for 30 min at 37 °C. CTLs were then added at an effector:target ratio of 10:1 (104 cells in 100 μl), and 51Cr release was measured after 4 h at 37 °C. HLA-A1 (α1 and α2 domains) structure was obtained by modeling the crystallographic data of the HLA-A2 3D structure (48Madden D.R. Garboczi D.N. Wiley D.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 693-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY), both molecules sharing more than 85% sequence homology in their peptide binding grooves. The HLA-A2/Tax nonamer to HLA-A1/MAGE-1.A1 mutations were introduced manually using the program o. Side chain conformation was based on the most probable rotamer and the probable hydrogen bonds. The structure obtained was minimized by X-PLOR. Additional minimization, 1000 iterations without constraints using Steepest Descent minimization, was performed after transfer of HLA-A1/MAGE-1.A1 data to insightII (Biosym Technologies), and further studies were performed using insightII. MAGE-1.A1 residues at P2 and P8 were then substituted by their non-natural analogues using HOMOLOGY (for d-isomers and Aib) and BIOPOLYMER (for NMe-aa) modules of insightII (Biosym Technologies) followed by minimization using VA09A (500 iterations without constraints) and STEEPEST DESCENT (1000 iterations without constraints) algorithms. MAGE-1.A1 degradation fragments generated at 37 °C were analyzed by on-line HPLC/MS. UV analysis (Fig. 1, panel a) facilitated the quantification and determination of the kinetics for the appearance and disappearance of each peak (peaks A–F). In the experimental conditions used, the MAGE-1.A1 half-life (incubation time necessary for the degradation to half of the initial quantity of peptide) was less than 30 min (Fig. 2,panel a). MS analysis (Fig. 1, panel b) of each peak facilitated the determination of the corresponding MAGE-1.A1 degradation fragment. The mass spectrum of peak D (m/z = 269) is given as an example in Fig.1 b (inset). In the MAGE-1.A1 sequence, the only fragment corresponding to a m/z value of 269 is the dipeptide SY. Similar analysis of peaks A–F led to the identification of all MAGE-1.A1 degradation fragments (TableI). The kinetics studies (Fig. 2,panels a, e, and i) allowed us to establish the degradation pathway of MAGE-1.A1 (Fig.1 c); MAGE-1.A1 was sensitive to two exopeptidase activities, aminopeptidase and dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (or angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE). The major pathway was initiated by two successive aminopeptidase cleavages, leading to the heptapeptide DPTGHSY (peak E), then cleaved by ACE to give the pentapeptide DPTGH (peak A) and the dipeptide SY (peak D) (degraded itself to amino acids). Direct action of ACE on MAGE-1.A1 represented a minor degradation pathway.Figure 2Degradation kinetics of MAGE-1.A1, analogues 5 ([Aib2]), 8 ([NMeSer8]), and 10 ([Aib2, NMeSer8]). Amount of the parent peptide or its degradation fragments was determined at different incubation times in serum by measuring the surface of the corresponding HPLC peak. Peptide degradation kinetics are shown in upper panels (a–d). Fragments resulting from aminopeptidase and ACE degradation are presented in middle(e–h) and lower (i–l) panels, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IMAGE-1.A1 degradation product retention times, characteristic ions, and deduced sequencesPeakRetention timeMeasured massDeduced sequence[MH]+[M+2H]2+minA07.44526.3263.9DPTGHB11.37182.0YC11.58726.4363.9ADPTGHD14.22269.1—SYE21.12776.4388.8DPTGHSYF22.00847.5424.6ADPTGHSYMAGE-1.A123.30976.4488.9EADPTGHSYRetention times were deduced from the UV chromatogram (Fig.1 a) corresponding to a sample of MAGE-1.A1 incubated for 30 min in human serum.

Sequences of degradation fragments were deduced from masses measured by MS. Open table in a new tab Retention times were deduced from the UV chromatogram (Fig.1 a) corresponding to a sample of MAGE-1.A1 incubated for 30 min in human serum. Masses of MAGE-1.A1 and its degradation fragments (simply [MH]+ or doubly charged [M + 2H]2+) were measured by on-line HPLC-MS analysis of the same sample (Fig.1 b). Sequences of degradation fragments were deduced from masses measured by MS. A series of MAGE-1.A1 analogues modified at positions engaged in one or both of the peptidase-sensitive bonds Glu1-Ala2 and His7-Ser8was synthesized and then studied for their degradation properties (Table II). Peptides substituted at either position 1 or 2 (analogues 1 to 5) showed increased half-lives but this effect remained poorly effective since it varied from very weak (analogue 5) to moderate (analogue3) in a range of 5–25 min increase as compared with MAGE-1.A1 half-life. However, all these substitutions were efficient against aminopeptidases, since none of the fragments 2–9 and 3–9 expected from aminopeptidase cleavage of the nonamer were detectable by UV (see for example analogue 5 in Fig. 2, panel f) or on-line HPLC/MS (data not shown) analysis. In contrast, in all cases, the fragment 1–7, generated from ACE cleavage, was more intense than for unmodified MAGE-1.A1 degradation, showing that NH2-terminal protection of the peptide rendered its COOH terminus more sensitive (see analogue 5 in Fig. 2,panel j). This explains the poor overall gain in half-life for these analogues. At the COOH terminus, substitutions at positions 7 or 8 (analogues 6–8) did not significantly improve MAGE-1.A1 half-life, as expected, since ACE cleavage represents the minor degradation pathway. However, they efficiently protected MAGE-1.A1 against ACE, since fragments 1–7 and 8–9 were totally undetectable among the degradation products of the COOH terminus-protected analogues by UV (see analogue 8,Fig. 2, panel k) or by on-line HPLC/MS (data not shown) analysis. However, analogues were degraded by aminopeptidases giving fragments 2–9, 3–9 and 5–9 (see for example analogue8 in Fig. 2, panel g). As protection of one extremity sensitized the opposite one to peptidase activity, we synthesized four analogues (9–12) in which substitutions at NH2 and COOH terminus were combined. All four disubstituted peptides showed no detectable degradation even after a 24-h incubation in serum (Table II) (analogue 10 is shown in Fig. 2, panels d, h, andl). This shows that disubstitution conferred long term resistance to both aminopeptidase and ACE and, importantly, that MAGE-1.A1 was not sensitive to other peptidase activities in serum.Table IIBiochemical properties of MAGE-1.A1 and its substituted analoguesAnalogue no.Substituted position(s)SequenceStability (half-life)aBinding affinity123456789(SC50)bμmGluAlaAspProThrGlyHisSerTyr30 min0.2 ± 0.0211D--------45 min7 ± 321NMe--------45 min20 ± 232-D-------55 min55 ± 842-NMe-------40 min8 ± 252-Aib-------35 min1.2 ± 0.367------D--35 min3 ± 178-------D-30 min50 ± 588-------NMe-35 min1.1 ± 0.492, 7-Aib----D-->24 h9 ± 2102, 8-Aib-----NMe->24 h4 ± 1112, 8-NMe-----NMe->24 h20 ± 3122, 8-D-----D->24 h>100Part a, half-lives were determined as follows: after different incubation times in human serum, the parent peptide was separated from its degradation fragments by HPLC, and the corresponding peak was quantified (Fig. 2, upper panels).

Open table in a new tab Part a, half-lives were determined as follows: after different incubation times in human serum, the parent peptide was separated from its degradation fragments by HPLC, and the corresponding peak was quantified (Fig. 2, upper panels). Part b, binding affinities (MHC stabilization assay) are the mean of at least three independent experiments. Binding of the structurally modified analogues to HLA-A1 was then tested and compared with that of the parent peptide MAGE-1.A1 (examples are shown in Fig. 3, panels a, d, g, and j; results are presented in Table II, right column). The effect of a substitution on MHC binding depended on both the nature of the chemical modification and its position in the peptide sequence. Introduction of Aib at position 2 (analogue 5), a d-isomer at position 7 (analogue 6), or a NMe group at position 8 (analogue 8) did not alter dramatically HLA-A1 binding of MAGE-1.A1 (Table II). When two of these substitutions were introduced in the same sequence, their effects accumulated; the disubstituted analogues 9 and 10 bound to HLA-A1 with lowered but still good affinities (Fig. 3, panels a andd; Table II). Unlike the previous substitutions, D isomerization at position 2 (analogue 3) or 8 (analogue7) dramatically decreased HLA-A1 binding. Consequently, the disubstituted [d-Ala2,d-Ser8] peptide (analogue 12) did not bind to HLA-A1. Finally, the monosubstituted analogues 1 and 4 and disubstituted analogue 11 exhibited intermediate to weak (i.e. 30–100 times lower than that of MAGE-1.A1) binding to HLA-A1 (Fig. 3, panel g; Table II). Thus, out of the 12 non-natural MAGE-1.A1 analogues, 2 (analogues 9 and10) were peptidase-resistant with preserved HLA-A1 binding properties. MAGE-1.A1 mono- and disubstituted analogues were tested for their capacity to activate anti-melanoma MAGE-1.A1-specific CTL clones 82/30 and 258/8. Residues Gly5, Thr6, and His7 are recognized by both clones while residues Pro4 and Ser8 are selectively recognized by clones 82/30 and 258/8, respectively (32Romero P. Pannetier C. Herman J.

For example, keratins 5 and 14 are expressed in the proliferating basal layers. In the differentiated suprabasal layer, their expression is down-regulated, as the expression of early differentiation marker genes keratin 1 and 10 and involucrin are turned on. Loricrin, filaggrin, transglutaminase, localized in the upper spinous and granular layers of the epidermis and upper GI1 tract tissues, are predominant markers for late epithelial differentiation. Genes expressed in the squamous epithelium of the upper GI tract, despite limited research, have been shown to resemble the epidermis. In mouse forestomach, keratins 5 and 14 are expressed in the basal layers, while keratins 1 and 10 are expressed in the suprabasal layer where cells are terminally differentiated (24Schweizer J.

Moreover, while the majority of research has focused on keratin genes involved in basal cell proliferation or early differentiation, and the early differentiation marker involucrin gene, only a few of the several genes involved in the latest stages of epithelial differentiation have been studied, including transglutaminase 3, loricrin (20Lee J.H.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 113: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is ubiquitously distributed among vertebrate tissues, but the level of expression varies markedly among different tissues. In humans, high levels of ADA are found in the proximal small intestine and thymus. The upper GI tract tissues, especially the stomach, also express enhanced levels of ADA (31Aronow B. Lattier D. Silbiger R. Dusing M. Hutton J. Jones G. Stock J. McNeish J. Potter S. Witte D. Wiginton D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1384-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In adult mice, the highest levels of ADA also occur in the gastrointestinal tract, including the absorptive epithelium of the small intestine and the keratinized squamous epithelium that lines the tongue, esophagus, and forestomach. In fact, these mucosal layers are the richest naturally occurring sources of ADA where the enzyme accounts for as much as 20% of the total soluble protein (32Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knudsen T.B. Kellems R. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunostaining analysis showed that ADA is localized predominantly to the granular layer of keratinized epithelium (32Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knudsen T.B. Kellems R. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), rendering it another marker of the late stage of keratinocyte differentiation in the upper GI tract. Given the abundance of murine ADA and its cellular localization in the upper GI tract, utilizing the Ada gene as a model for studying gene expression in the GI tract will likely contribute to our knowledge of keratinocyte terminal differentiation, and enhance our appreciation for the function of the vast amount of ADA in the GI epithelium. The work presented in this paper focuses on defining thecis-regulatory elements and protein factors that direct this enhanced level of expression in the GI epithelium, especially the forestomach epithelium.Using transgenic mouse techniques, we have identified a 1.1-kbEagI-HindIII fragment from 5′-flanking region of the murine Ada gene that is able to direct chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression in the forestomach of transgenic mice. In situ hybridization shows that thecat expression directed by the forestomach regulatory element exhibits the same cellular localization as the endogenousAda gene. This cat expression also displays copy number dependence, shows the same developmental timing and comparable level as the endogenous Ada gene. Sequence analysis revealed both general and tissue-specific protein-binding sites within this 1.1-kb sequence. Deletions and site-specific mutations of some potential protein-binding sites resulted in decreased levels of reporter gene expression, suggesting the involvement of these factors in regulating Ada expression in the forestomach.DISCUSSUIONIn addition to its low level of ubiquitous expression in almost all tissues, the murine Ada gene is expressed at substantially elevated levels in a small collection of diverse tissues, especially in those of the gastrointestinal tract. The expression ofAda in the GI tract displays a cell type- and lineage-specificity, confined to the epithelial cells lining the mucosa of the tongue, esophagus, forestomach as well as small intestine (32Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knudsen T.B. Kellems R. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The relative level of ADA protein is extremely high, comprising approximately 20% of soluble protein in the mucosal layer (32Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knudsen T.B. Kellems R. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To facilitate a greater understanding of the physiological significance of ADA in the gastrointestinal tract and the regulation of gene expression in the upper GI tract, we wish to identify signaling pathways that govern the temporal and cellular expression of the murineAda gene during GI development using transgenic mouse assays. The data reported here represent the identification and detailed analysis of a 1.1-kb sequence located 3.4 kb upstream of the transcription initiation site of the murine Ada gene, which is sufficient to target cat reporter gene expression to the forestomach in transgenic mice. This expression is localized to the appropriate cell types, confers copy number dependence, and shows the same developmental regulation. These facts indicate that this forestomach-specific regulatory element contains all thecis-acting genetic information that is necessary to reproduce the endogenous pattern of murine Ada expression in the forestomach.Both immunofluorescence staining from previous work in our laboratory (32Chinsky J.M. Ramamurthy V. Fanslow W.C. Ingolia D.E. Blackburn M.R. Shaffer K.T. Higley H.R. Trentin J.J. Rudolph F.B. Knudsen T.B. Kellems R. Differentiation. 1990; 42: 172-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and in situ hybridization in the present study showed that murine Ada message is localized predominantly to the keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, especially to the late differentiated keratinocytes. Ada is undetectable in any non-squamous cells in the lamina propria or muscularis mucosae in the mucosa, submucosa, external muscularis mucosae, or serosa. The identified forestomach enhancer is capable of directing catreporter gene expression mainly to the terminally differentiated cells. Detailed analysis of this 1.1-kb regulatory element in the forestomach epithelium is therefore of importance, since it will give us insights into the molecular basis of gene regulation on the terminally differentiated cells in the upper GI epithelium.Although tongue and esophagus are histologically similar to forestomach, CAT assays as well as RNase protection assays showed that this forestomach regulatory element does not direct enhancedcat expression in those tissues, at least not at expected high levels as compared with those of the endogenous Adaexpression. These interesting observations, along with a number of previous studies both in human and mouse, indicate that the regulation of murine Ada in each tissue is complex and involves different regulatory elements for different or even closely related tissues or cell types, in this case, all the upper GI tract tissues. In fact, we and others have shown that distinct regulatory modules govern expression in both the murine thymus (37Winston J.H. Hong L. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and placenta (38Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as well as the human thymus (39Aronow B.J. Silbiger R.N. Dusing M.R. Stock J.L. Yager K.L. Potter S.S. Hutton J.J. Wiginton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4170-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and small intestine (40Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In addition, a locus control region has also been identified in intron 1 region of the human ADA gene (39Aronow B.J. Silbiger R.N. Dusing M.R. Stock J.L. Yager K.L. Potter S.S. Hutton J.J. Wiginton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4170-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Aronow B.J. Ebert C.A. Valerius M.T. Potter S.S. Wiginton D.A. Witte D.P. Hutton J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and similarly, an element responsible for ubiquitous expression in intron 1 of the murine Ada gene (37Winston J.H. Hong L. Datta S.K. Kellems R.E. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1996; 22: 261-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar).The position independence, copy number dependence associated with transgenes carrying the forestomach regulatory region, and the strong enhancer activity observed in the transgenic forestomach qualify this element as locus control region (LCR), a regulatory element acting as a dominant activator in establishing the transcriptional competency of a complete gene locus/chromatin domain (42Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 61-63Crossref Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Since their initial description in the human β-globin locus, LCR elements have been recognized in several other genes, including the human ADA T-cell enhancer/LCR and duodenal enhancer (40Dusing M.R. Brickner A.G. Thomas M.B. Wiginton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26634-26642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Aronow B.J. Ebert C.A. Valerius M.T. Potter S.S. Wiginton D.A. Witte D.P. Hutton J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1123-1135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike human T-cell/LCR and duodenal enhancer, the identified forestomach regulatory element neither drives ubiquitous low level expression, nor requires additional sequences for full activation. It, in fact, seems to contain all the information to ensure integration site independent, copy number dependent expression of transgenes. LCRs have been suggested to exert their functions by recruiting protein factors that lead to hyperacetylation of histones and subsequently to the unfolding of the chromatin (42Blackwood E.M. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1998; 281: 61-63Crossref Scopus (607) Google Scholar, 43Wade P.A. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 128-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 44Pennisi E. Science. 1997; 275: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The forestomach regulatory element presumably contains multiple binding sites for sequence-specific transcriptional activators for its function both as an enhancer and as an LCR, and it may exert its LCR function by recruiting histone acetyltransferase, such as CBP/p300 (45Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar), to the Ada promoter. The hyperacetylation of histones and subsequent unfolding of the chromatin may eventually result in activation of the Ada promoter. Further analysis of this element would give us more insight regarding how LCR elements function.To fully understand the molecular aspect of the regulation of this forestomach enhancer, we conducted mutational analysis of this enhancer to identify important transcription factor-binding sites. In the process of determining protein factors involved in regulating this forestomach enhancer using footprinting and gel mobility shift assays, we encountered some difficulties. Since the keratinized stratified squamous epithelium where Ada is highly expressed in the forestomach is terminally differentiated and enucleated, it is very difficult to prepare nuclear extract from the forestomach mucosa. However, sequence analysis of this enhancer revealed several potential transcription factor-binding sites that have been shown to be functionally important on other keratinocyte-specific promoters or enhancers, among which is an AP-2 factor-binding site located at the 3′ end of this regulatory element. AP-2 consensus binding motifs have been recognized in many keratin promoters and enhancers and other epidermis-specific or squamous epithelium-specific genes (46Eckert R.L. Welter J.F. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1996; 23: 59-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 47Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Despite this, it has been shown that AP-2 determines, in vitro, the level of transcription rather than functioning as a sole determinant of the epithelial specificity of gene expression (48Magnaldo T. Vidal R.G. Ohtsuki M. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 307-315PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to their findings, the cat reporter gene expression in our AP-2 mutant construct (AP2FCAT) decreased significantly, however, forestomach restricted expression remained (data not shown). This result indicates that the role of the AP-2-like factor in squamous epithelium gene expression is quantitative rather than qualitative. That is, rather than determining epithelial specificity, this AP-2-like factor modulates, in vivo, the level of expression of epithelial genes. AP-2 contains three isoforms AP-2α, AP-2β, and A-2γ, all of which have distinct but partially overlapping patterns of expression (49Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R.

Our RNase protection assays (data not shown) and data from other laboratories (51Oulad-Abdelghani M. Bouillet P. Chazaud C. Dolle P. Chambon P. Exp.

Dyn. 1997; 208: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) confirmed the presence of all three AP-2 isoforms in the upper GI tract tissues, which suggest that AP-2α, AP-2β, and A-2γ may all be involved in the regulation of this forestomach enhancer. Further transfection analysis is needed to delineate the definite role of each AP-2 gene in regulating this enhancer and, moreover, squamous epithelium genes in general.Within a 200-bp region at the 5′ end of the forestomach enhancer, there is a cluster of transcriptional binding motifs that have been shown to regulate the expression of other squamous epithelium-specific genes. These motifs include six AP-1 sites, two CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBP) binding sites and a CACCC-like motif. AP-1 binding motifs are found in the keratin promoters (11Huff C.A. Yuspa S.H.

C/EBP proteins, members of the bZIP family of DNA-binding proteins/transcription factors, play a fundamental role both in the differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes and in the regulation of the expression of many different genes encoding cytokines in several cell types (56Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar, 57Freytag S.O. Paielli D.L. Gilbert J.D.

A. 1993; 90: 2584-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). High level expression of C/EBP has recently been shown to be associated with squamous differentiation in epidermis, suggesting that it may play an important role in regulating one or more aspects of the squamous epithelium differentiation program (61Maytin E.V. Habener J.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 238-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 62Oh H.S. Smart R.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 110: 939-945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The importance of the CACCC-like element in the transactivation of genes expressed in the upper GI tract has been demonstrated in its interaction with gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor and activating the Epstein-Barr virus EL-2D promoter (26Nakagawa H. Inomoto T. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16688-16699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Jenkins T.D. Nakagawa H. Rustgi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24433-24442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor is localized to suprabasal cells in skin, tongue, esophageal, and intestinal squamous epithelial cells (63Shields J.M. Christy R.J. Yang V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20009-20017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), rendering it a good candidate for regulating the suprabasal-layer expressed Ada gene. Although the role of each possible transcription factor has not been assessed, the functional importance of this 200-bp region is evident since deletion of this sequence abolished reporter gene activity in the transgenic forestomach. Additional experiments are required to fully assess the importance of the above mentioned transcription factors.The evidence that the Ada forestomach enhancer consists of a collection of distinct genetic regulatory motifs suggests that a combination of multiple transcription factors are required for the forestomach epithelium-specific expression of murine Ada, even though many of these factors, such as AP1 and AP-2, also appear in nonepithelial cells. It is possible that appropriate combinations of these potential factors, including AP-2 factor, AP1 factors, C/EBP factors, gut-enriched Krüppel-like factor, and other ubiquitously as well as epithelium-specific factors, may provide a mechanism for the determination of epithelium specificity (64Ohtsuki M. Flanagan S. Freedberg I.M. Blumenberg M. Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 201-213PubMed Google Scholar). Future experiments will provide more insight into this aspect of the molecular mechanism of gene regulation in the squamous epithelium. The mucosa of murine upper gastrointestinal tract tissues,i.e. tongue, esophagus, and forestomach, like the epidermis, undergoes organized progressive differentiation to form a mature stratified squamous epithelium, which is comprised almost exclusively of keratinocytes (1Hummel K.P.

Keratinocyte differentiation is the process whereby a relatively undifferentiated keratinocyte in the basal layer is converted, via intermediate spinous and granular layers, into a terminally differentiated corneocyte in the cornified layer (4Green H. Fuchs E. Watt F. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 46: 293-301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Eckert R.L. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 1316-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Insights into transcriptional regulation of gene expression in keratinocytes have been gained mainly through analysis of the eukaryotic cytokeratin promoters (6Fuchs E. J. Cell Sci.

Endothelin-1 binding to the endothelin B receptor (ETB), a member of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors, was associated with catalytic activation of the extracellular-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) and stimulation of AP-1 transcriptional reporter activity. A panel of single point mutations in transmembrane helix 6 (TM6), intracellular loop 3, and transmembrane helix 7 (TM7) were developed to study the structural requirements for ETB activation. Point mutations within highly conserved regions of TM6 and intracellular loop 3 were without effect on agonist-stimulated ERK activation. However, mutations within TM7 of the ETB significantly impacted ligand-stimulated downstream signaling. For example, nine point mutations within TM7 of the ETB were identified that prevented endothelin-stimulated ERK activation. Interestingly, the TM7 mutants fell into two classes; several exhibited greatly decreased AP-1 activity, relative to wild type ETB, whereas others displayed augmented endothelin-stimulated AP-1 transcriptional activity relative to wild type ETB. Our results suggest that TM7 of the ETB is involved in its activation mechanism and regulates agonist-stimulated ERK activation.

The endothelin receptors are members of a superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors that are thought to activate downstream signaling networks through their dynamic interaction with heterotrimeric G-proteins. Mutational studies of the endothelin receptors have defined extracellular loop 2 as being critical for ligand contact and binding, whereas the cytoplasmic tail has been implicated as important for coupling to G-proteins (15Hashido K. Adachi M. Gamou T. Watanabe T. Furuichi Y. Miyamoto C. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 3-12PubMed Google Scholar, 16Adachi M. Hashido K. Trzeciak A. Watanabe T. Furuichi Y. Miyamoto C. J. Cardiovasc.

The relationship between ligand binding affinity and receptor-G-protein interaction is described by the ternary complex model of receptor activation (18De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely thought that a small fraction of receptors reside in the activated conformation and that agonist binding stabilizes this conformation, which results in activation of the associated G-protein. The dynamic interaction of ligand-receptor-G-protein is thought to result in high affinity agonist binding when the receptor is in the active, G-protein bound state. Therefore, mutations that diminish or prevent receptor-G-protein binding in some cases are associated with decreased agonist binding. In contrast, several constitutively active GPCR mutants have been identified that result in higher affinity ligand binding (17Aquilla E. Whelchel A. Knot H.J. Nelson M. Posada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31572-31579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although the molecular interactions that govern GPCR activation have not been completely defined, mutagenesis studies, biophysical analysis, and cryoelectron microscopy of rhodopsin, a well characterized GPCR, have provided a comprehensive model for GPCR activation (21Dratz E.A. Hargrave P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Unger V.M. Schertler Biophys.

Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Transmembrane helices 3 and 6 are thought to be packed into close proximity in three-dimensional space, and ligand binding results in rigid body movement of TM6 relative to TM3. This displacement of helix 6 relative to helix 3 is hypothesized to induce a conformational change in the loop connecting TM5 and TM6, which is where GT is associated with the receptor (24Franke R.R. Koenig B. Sakmar T.P. Khorana H.G. Hoffman K.P. Science. 1990; 250: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The importance of TM6 has been confirmed through mutagenesis studies of other GPCRs. For example, the α1B-adrenergic receptor can be constitutively activated by mutation of alanine 293, located on the intracellular side of TM6 (25Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the m5 muscarinic receptor can be constitutively activated by mutations at the extracellular side of TM6 (20Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taken together the data imply that TM6 is important in the activation mechanism of the adrenergic and muscarinic GPCRs. We have therefore examined the TM6 region of the ETB to define the importance of this domain in ERK activation and AP-1 transcriptional control. Our results indicate that the ETB is distinct from the muscarinic and adrenergic receptors in this regard, because mutation of several highly conserved amino acids within or near TM6 had little or no effect on activation of ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase. In contrast, we have observed that TM7 of the ETB is critical for proper signaling functions of the receptor. Point mutations within the TM7 region of the ETB interfered with ligand-stimulated ERK activation and had dual effects on AP-1 transcriptional activation. COS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For kinase assays cells approximately 50% confluent in 100-mm plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids (5 μl/μg DNA) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were exposed to the LipofectAMINE/DNA mixture for 6 h in DMEM, the medium was changed to DMEM/10% FBS, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Cells were serum starved by changing the medium to DMEM/0.1% FBS for 16 h, and the cells were treated with endothelin and harvested for immunoprecipitation. For immunofluorescence COS cells were grown and transfected in 0.2-μm glass slides. For AP-1 reporter assays the AP-1/luciferase plasmid was co-transfected with wild type and mutant ETB plasmids and pCMV-β-gal, which encodes β-galactosidase at a ratio of 5:1. ERK2 containing a 6-fold repeated Myc epitope fused in frame to the 5′ end was used as described previously (17Aquilla E. Whelchel A. Knot H.J. Nelson M. Posada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31572-31579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Wild type rat endothelin B receptor (GenBankTM accession number X57765) was subcloned into pCDNA3 containing a FLAG epitope fuse in frame at the 3′ end as described previously (17Aquilla E. Whelchel A. Knot H.J. Nelson M. Posada J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31572-31579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Single point mutations were made in TM6, TM7, and the third intracellular loop of the rat ETB using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH) following the manufacturer's instructions. All mutations were verified by sequencing. The AP-1/lucierase plasmid contains the AP-1 transcriptional promoter element cloned upstream of the luciferase gene (kindly provided by Dr. Mercedes Rincon, University of Vermont). Single point mutations were introduced into the wild type rat ETB using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit following the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). Briefly, a selection primer was engineered that changed a unique SmaI site in the pcDNA3 vector at nucleotide 2093 to a XhoI site that was also unique. Additional primers were designed that changed the desired amino acids in the ETB. After synthesizing the mutant strand in vitro the plasmids were transformed into amutS Escherichia coli strain. Parental plasmids were eliminated by digestion with SmaI, and the pool of plasmids was transformed again. Colonies were picked, and the mutations were confirmed by sequencing. COS cells were grown in 6-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. At 50% confluence, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of ETB DNA, 0.25 μg of AP-1/luciferase reporter plasmid, and 0.1 μg of β-gal using LipofectAMINE in serum-free DMEM. After 5 h the medium was changed to growth medium, and the cells were grown for 24 h. Cells were changed to 0.1% FBS serum, incubated overnight, and then stimulated with endothelin for 6 h. The receptors were transfected into three individual culture dishes, and the values are the means ± S.D. of the three independent measurements. Cell lysates were made, and luciferase activity was measured in a scintillation counter according to the manufacturer's specifications (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-gal activity. Cells were grown in 2-well Nunc chambered slides until approximately 50% confluent and transfected with 1 μg of ETB DNA and 3 μl of LipofectAMINE, and the medium was changed to 10% FBS 5 h later. Cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with MeOH. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the anti-flag antibody (M2, Kodak Corp. New Haven, CT) at 2 μg/ml. The cells were rinsed and blocked again for 30 min in 5% normal goat serum. Cells were washed five times over 30 min in TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20), incubated for 45 min in the dark at room temperature in a CY3-conjugated, affinity purified, goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and mounted with VECTASHIELD (Vector laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) containing DAPI. COS cells co-transfected with wild type or mutant ETBs and MT-ERK2 were treated with endothelin (100 nm) for 10 min. Cells were scraped into 600 μl of 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmHepes, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% aprotinin, 50 μm microcystin, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The Myc-tagged ERK2 was immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibody 9E10. The immunoprecipitates were washed and incubated in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol) in the presence of myelin basic protein (MBP) and [γ32P]ATP (5 μCi) for 15 min. The extent of phosphorylation of MBP was analyzed by running the immunoprecipitates on a 15% SDS gel and subsequent autoradiography. COS cells transfected with empty vector, wild type ETB, or ETB mutants were lysed in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and the post-nuclear supernatants were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to isolate the membrane fraction. COS cell membranes (10 μg) were incubated with 50 pm125I-endothelin-1 for 3 h. The membranes were applied to Whatman GF/B filters and washed extensively prior to counting. Nonspecific binding was estimated by incubating the125I-endothelin-1 in the presence of excess (1 μm) unlabeled endothelin. Nonspecific binding averaged 15–25% of specific binding. Binding of endothelin to ETB mutant receptors is expressed relative to the binding observed in the membranes expressing the wild type receptor. Cos cells were transfected with wild type or mutant ETBs and grown to approximately 80% confluency. Whole cells were washed in binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.25 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4) and incubated at 4 °C with 125I-ET at either 50 or 150 pm for 3 h. Nonspecific binding was estimated by incubation of vector transformed cells in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled ET. Following incubations, cells were washed three times in ice-cold binding buffer and lysed in 0.1 nNaOH. Lysates were collected, and 125I-ET content determined by liquid scintillation γ counting using a Packard B5005 γ counter. Because direct structural information is not available for GPCRs, models regarding the activation mechanism of this family of receptors have relied primarily on mutagenesis and biophysical studies. Secondary structure models have provided insight into the topology of rhodopsin, including the packing of the transmembrane helices (21Dratz E.A. Hargrave P.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 128-131Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 22Unger V.M. Schertler Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 1776-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Recent work on rhodopsin indicates that the activation mechanism involves rigid body movement of TM6 (23Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). The primary sequence of the GPCR superfamily reveals several highly conserved amino acids in this helix that are also present in the ETB (Fig.1). We wished to determine whether the activation mechanism of ETB involves TM6. Therefore, we made substitutions of several highly conserved residues in this region. Our results indicate that although several residues within TM6 are almost invariably conserved among the GPCR superfamily, mutation of these residues in the ETB appeared to be without effect on ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase activation (Fig.2). ETB mutants F331A, C334A, W335A, P337A, S341K, and K345A were co-transfected into COS cells with MT-ERK2. Endothelin stimulated ERK2 catalytic activation in the wild type ETB and mutant receptors at approximately similar levels. The basal level of ERK activity for unstimulated mutant receptors was also unchanged relative to wild type receptor (Fig. 2 B). Because TM6 of the ETB is not sensitive to structural changes introduced by mutagenesis, the data infer that this helix is not integrally involved in the activation mechanism of this receptor. Several studies have implicated the third intracellular loop of GPCRs, such as the adrenergic and muscarinic receptors, as playing a role in downstream effector function (20Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we also examined the third loop of the ETB by introducing amino acid substitutions into this area and expressing the mutant receptors in COS cells with MT-ERK2. The third loop of the ETB appeared to be relatively unaffected by mutation. ETB mutants M299A, T323A, M306A, and D312A had essentially wild type levels of ERK activation, whereas ETB mutants Q316A and K322A were slightly reduced in their ability to activate ERK (Fig.3) As with the TM6 region of the ETB, analysis of the basal activity of ERK in cells transfected with mutant receptors revealed levels of activity comparable with those of unstimulated wild type receptors (Fig. 2 B). Transmembrane helix 7 of the ETB shares relatively little homology with other GPCRs, and in fact the GPCR superfamily has little overall homology in this region (Fig. 1). However, TM7 of the ETB was very sensitive to mutation. A panel of TM7 mutants were engineered and co-expressed in COS cells with MT-ERK2. ETB mutants M373K, N377P, S378K, I380A, P382K, L385A, V388K, and K390A were all severely compromised in their ability to activate ERK, in comparison with wild type (Fig. 4). Western blotting of the COS cell lysates demonstrated that MT-ERK2 was expressed at similar levels across the experiment, confirming that the decrease in catalytic activity was due to decreased activation of MT-ERK2 and not lower expression of the kinase. Although several TM7 mutant receptors revealed slightly elevated levels of basal ERK activity relative to wild type receptor (Fig. 2 B), this was not reflected in an increase in ET-stimulated ERK activity relative to wild type receptors. This suggests that introduced mutations did not produce catalytically active mutants. Introducing nonconserved amino acid changes in the ETB could reduce its downstream signaling capabilities as a result of a gross alteration in the topology of the receptor. Therefore, we investigated the expression levels and localization of the ETB mutant receptors by immunofluorescence. Receptors bearing a FLAG tag on their carboxyl terminus were expressed in COS cells and processed for immunofluorescence using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Fig.5). The mutant receptors were expressed and localized in essentially the same manner as the wild type receptor. The data indicate that the inability of the TM7 mutations to activate ERK resulted from a defect in the activation mechanism, rather than a mutation-induced effect on expression or localization of the mutant receptors. Ligand binding to the ETB triggers a diverse spectrum of biological responses, depending on the target tissue in which the receptor is expressed. ETBs stimulate mitogenesis in selective cell types, and this response is thought to involve the activation of key transcriptional events, including AP-1 activity (14Simonson M.S. Jones J.M. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8643-8649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, catalytically activated ERK is known to phosphorylate transcription factors involved in AP-1 activity (26Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar) and stimulate transcription. Therefore, we wished to determine whether ERK activation is required for AP-1 transcriptional activation. To this end we have examined transcriptional activation of an AP-1 luciferase reporter construct by wild type and mutant ETBs (8Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1074-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mutants fell into two distinct classes based on their ability to stimulate AP-1 transcriptional activation. Several of the mutations in TM7 of the ETB significantly decreased endothelin-stimulated AP-1 transcriptional activation. For example, N377P, S378K, P382K, A384K, L385A, K390A, and F392A were compromised in their ability to stimulate AP-1 reporter activity when exposed to ligand. Interestingly, a second class of TM7 mutant was identified that displayed augmented endothelin-stimulated AP-1 transcriptional activity. TM7 mutants D367A, N372A, I383A, V388K, and I380A when stimulated with ligand demonstrated augmented AP-1 activity compared with wild type ETB (Fig. 6). The I380A TM7 mutant had the largest increase in ligand-stimulated AP-1 activity. These mutants were consistently observed to have increased endothelin-stimulated AP-1 activity; however, the basal AP-1 activity was essentially the same as wild type (data not shown). The results suggest that TM7 of the ETB is integrally involved in ligand-induced activation of AP-1 activity because mutations were identified that both prevented and augmented AP-1 responses. The ternary complex model defines the dynamic interactions between receptor-G-protein interactions and ligand binding (18De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7108-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High affinity agonist binding is thought to be dependent on efficient G-protein interactions with the receptor. Furthermore, several constitutively activated GPCRs are found to have increased affinity for agonist (19Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ternary complex model suggests that receptor mutations that decrease or interfere with proper receptor-G-protein physical interactions will result in altered agonist binding. We conducted binding studies on both purified membranes and transfected, whole cell preparations for each receptor mutant. Our results are consistent with this model. Several of the TM7 mutants displayed a range of 125I-endothelin binding, which was generally lower than the wild type receptor, suggesting that the mutant receptors were impaired in their ability to couple with G-protein (Table I and Fig.7). Other mutants displayed binding closer to wild type levels but were unable to efficiently activate ERK or stimulate AP-1 luciferase activity (N377P and S378K mutants; Figs. 6and 7 and Table I). Inefficient receptor-G-protein interactions may therefore account for the inability of ETB mutants to activate ERK. Furthermore, any decreased binding was not a result of a lack of receptor expression or localization, because the mutant ETBs were expressed and localized in a manner similar to that of the wild type receptor (Fig. 5).Table I125I-Endothelin binding to wild type and mutant ETB receptorsETB receptorPercentage of ControlWild type100D367A19N377P60S378K36I380A84P382K24A384K36L385A35F392A55V388K33K390A72 Open table in a new tab GPCRs form an important and diverse group of cell surface receptor proteins that have yet to be crystallized for structural studies. Mutagenesis experiments involving the major classes of GPCRs have provided a comprehensive picture regarding the molecular details of receptor-ligand interactions and receptor-G-proteins interactions. Studies with rhodopsin suggest a model of activation that involves interaction of TM3 and TM6. In the case of rhodopsin, rigid body movement of TM6 is thought to be induced by agonist binding and to alter the conformation of the binding site for transducin, the associated heterotrimeric G-protein (23Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). In our experiments we have introduced a series of point mutations in TM6, intracellular loop 3, and TM7 to define the regions of the ETB that are involved in downstream signaling. Our results provide insight into the activation mechanism of the ETB. The TM6 domain of the ETB has several residues that are highly conserved across a broad spectrum of GPCRs, and studies with rhodopsin implicate this region in the ligand-induced activation mechanism. Therefore, we postulated that these residues may be important in regulating the coupling of the ETB with downstream effectors, such as ERK activation. Surprisingly, systematic substitution of the highly conserved residues of TM6 had no effect on activation of ERK (Fig. 2). Although these residues are highly conserved, this area of the ETB does not appear to be sensitive to structural changes. The results argue against TM6 as being critically involved in ligand-induced ERK activation. The ETB appears to be distinct from at least two other GPCRs in which TM6 is involved in the activation mechanism. For example, in the case of the m5 muscarinic receptor, substitution of Ser465 at the extracellular junction of TM6 resulted in activation of the receptor (20Spalding T.A. Burstein E.S. Wells J.W. Brann M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10109-10116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Substitution of Ala293 of the α1B-adrenergic receptor, which is in loop 3 close to the junction of TM6, resulted in constitutive activation of the receptor (25Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid residues throughout TM6 and loop 3 of the ETB were mutated without effect on basal or ligand-induced ERK activation. Although these regions in the muscarinic and adrenergic receptors are involved in the activation mechanism of the receptors, this theme is not applicable to the ETB. The intracellular loops of GPCRs form a structure in the cytosol of the cell that may be important in mediating protein-protein interactions with heterotrimeric G-proteins. In fact, introducing mutations into this area can impair downstream signaling functions (25Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S. Ostrowski J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1430-1433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the ETB, the putative intracellular loops are very small, relative to other GPCRs. The intracellular loop 3 of the ETB is the largest and was therefore hypothesized as most likely to be involved in coupling to G-proteins and downstream signaling functions. We therefore systematically introduced point mutations into the ETB loop 3 area and evaluated the ability of the mutant receptors to activate the ERK pathway. Our results indicate that, similar to the TM6 region, loop 3 is not sensitive to the introduction of nonconserved amino acid substitutions. Several mutations were introduced into loop 3 of the ETB with no effect on ligand-stimulated ERK activation. In contrast, TM7 of the ETB proved to be very sensitive to mutation. Nine residues in TM7 were identified that, when substituted with a nonconserved residue, resulted in a significant decrease in ligand-stimulated ERK activation (Fig. 4). Our results differ from the rhodopsin model of GPCR activation to the extent that TM6 is postulated to be critically involved in ligand-induced activation of rhodopsin, whereas this region of the ETB does not appear to be important for ERK activation. In contrast, TM7 of the ETB was very sensitive to mutation, with respect to agonist-induced ERK activation. In the three-dimensional model of helix packing of rhodopsin, helix 7 is close to helix 6. Because helix 6 is thought to move during activation, it is possible that mutations of helix 7 sterically interfere with the ability of helix 6 to be displaced during ligand binding. However, if helix 6 of the ETB were critically involved in activation, a reasonable prediction would be that it should be sensitive to mutagenesis. Therefore, the data suggest the possibilities that the activation mechanism of the ETB is distinct from that of rhodopsin and that helix 7 of the ETB is involved in ligand-induced activation. Some of the biological effects of ETB activation are thought to involve activation of AP-1 mediated transcription (14Simonson M.S. Jones J.M. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8643-8649Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because ERK is known to phosphorylate transcription factors leading to increased AP-1 activity (26Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), we examined the relationship between ETB-stimulated ERK activation and AP-1 transcriptional activation. Seven of the residues in TM7 that were sensitive to mutation, with respect to ERK activation, demonstrated reduced AP-1/luciferase reporter activity, suggesting that AP-1 activation and ERK activity are positively correlated. Interestingly, there were five notable exceptions to this correlation. ETB TM7 mutants D367A, N372A, I383A, V388K, and I380A consistently demonstrated increased endothelin-stimulated AP-1 activity. The I380A TM7 mutant was especially notable because it consistently demonstrated augmented ligand-stimulated AP-1 activation. The basal ERK activity of the receptor mutants was similar to wild type levels with minor elevations in some TM7 mutants (F392A, S378K, p382K, and K390A). However, no positive correlation could be shown between increased basal ERK activity and increased AP-1 transcription (compare Fig.2 B with Fig. 6). With the exception of D367A, the mutants that had increased endothelin-stimulated AP-1 activity were unable to stimulate ERK kinase activity (Figs. 4 and 6). The results suggest that ERK activation and AP-1 activation are separable, and that ERK activity is not an absolute requirement for AP-1 activation. The mechanism whereby AP-1 is activated may involve one or more of the several signal transduction systems known to be activated by endothelin. Additional studies will be required to dissect the layers of interaction between the components of the endothelin signaling pathway. We thank Dr. Mercedes Rincon for providing plasmids."
