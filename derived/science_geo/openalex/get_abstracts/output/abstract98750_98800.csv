https://openalex.org/W1997208169,"Bcl-2 inhibits most types of apoptotic cell death, implying a common mechanism of lethality. Bcl-2 is localized to intracellular sites of oxygen free radical generation including mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula, and nuclear membranes. Antioxidants that scavenge peroxides, N-acetylcysteine and glutathione peroxidase, countered apoptotic death, while manganese superoxide dismutase did not. Bcl-2 protected cells from H2O2- and menadione-induced oxidative deaths. Bcl-2 did not prevent the cyanide-resistant oxidative burst generated by menadione. Two model systems of apoptosis showed no increment in cyanide-resistant respiration, and generation of endogenous peroxides continued at an inherent rate that was unaltered by Bcl-2. Following an apoptotic signal, cells sustained progressive lipid peroxidation. Overexpression of Bcl-2 functioned to suppress lipid peroxidation completely. We propose a model in which Bcl-2 regulates an antioxidant pathway at sites of free radical generation."

Inflammatory cells entering the anterior chamber of the eye in response to viral infection underwent apoptosis that was dependent on Fas (CD95)-Fas ligand (FasL) and produced no tissue damage. In contrast, viral infection in gld mice, which lack functional FasL, resulted in an inflammation and invasion of ocular tissue without apoptosis. Fas-positive but not Fas-negative tumor cells were killed by apoptosis when placed within isolated anterior segments of the eyes of normal but not FasL-negative mice. FasL messenger RNA and protein were detectable in the eye. Thus, Fas-FasL interactions appear to be an important mechanism for the maintenance of immune privilege."

The channel, called BIR (Kir6.2), was expressed in large amounts in rat pancreatic islets and glucose-responsive insulin-secreting cell lines. Coexpression with the sulfonylurea receptor SUR reconstituted an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance of 76 picosiemens that was sensitive to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (IKATP) and was inhibited by sulfonylureas and activated by diazoxide. The data indicate that these pancreatic beta cell potassium channels are a complex composed of at least two subunits--BIR, a member of the inward rectifier potassium channel family, and SUR, a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily. Gene mapping data show that these two potassium channel subunit genes are clustered on human chromosome 11 at position 11p15.1."

https://openalex.org/W2050674095,"Telomeres are multifunctional elements that shield chromosome ends from degradation and end-to-end fusions, prevent activation of DNA damage checkpoints, and modulate the maintenance of telomeric DNA by telomerase. A major protein component of human telomeres has been identified and cloned. This factor, TRF, contains one Myb-type DNA-binding repeat and an amino-terminal acidic domain. Immunofluorescent labeling shows that TRF specifically colocalizes with telomeric DNA in human interphase cells and is located at chromosome ends during metaphase. The presence of TRF along the telomeric TTAGGG repeat array demonstrates that human telomeres form a specialized nucleoprotein complex."

Embryonic stem cells were transfected with a dominant negative N-cadherin mutant (NCADΔ) under the control of promoters active in small intestinal epithelial cells and then introduced into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. Analysis of adult chimeric mice revealed that expression of NCADΔ along the entire crypt-villus axis, but not in the villus epithelium alone, produced an inflammatory bowel disease resembling Crohn's disease. NCADΔ perturbed proliferation, migration, and death programs in crypts, which lead to adenomas. This model provides insights about cadherin function in an adult organ and the factors underlying inflammatory bowel disease and intestinal neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2046200067,"Sodium (Na+) at high millimolar concentrations in soils is toxic to most higher plants and severely reduces agricultural production worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms for plant Na+ uptake remain unknown. Here, the wheat root high-affinity potassium (K+) uptake transporter HKT1 was shown to function as a high-affinity K(+)-Na+ cotransporter. High-affinity K+ uptake was activated by micromolar Na+ concentrations; moreover, high-affinity Na+ uptake was activated by K+ (half-activation constant, 2.8 microM K+). However, at physiologically detrimental concentrations of Na+, K+ accumulation mediated by HKT1 was blocked and low-affinity Na+ uptake occurred (Michaelis constant, approximately 16 mM Na+), which correlated to Na+ toxicity in plants. Point mutations in the sixth putative transmembrane domain of HKT1 that increase Na+ tolerance were isolated with the use of yeast as a screening system. Na+ uptake and Na+ inhibition of K+ accumulation indicate a possible role for HKT1 in physiological Na+ toxicity in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1972061284,"The force produced by a single molecule of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase during transcription was measured optically. Polymerase immobilized on a surface was used to transcribe a DNA template attached to a polystyrene bead 0.5 micrometer in diameter. The bead position was measured by interferometry while a force opposing translocation of the polymerase along the DNA was applied with an optical trap. At saturating nucleoside triphosphate concentrations, polymerase molecules stalled reversibly at a mean applied force estimated to be 14 piconewtons. This force is substantially larger than those measured for the cytoskeletal motors kinesin and myosin and exceeds mechanical loads that are estimated to oppose transcriptional elongation in vivo. The data are consistent with efficient conversion of the free energy liberated by RNA synthesis into mechanical work."
https://openalex.org/W2046348452,"The efficacy of pre- and postexposure treatment with the antiviral compound (R)-9-(2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine (PMPA) was tested against simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in macaques as a model for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). PMPA was administered subcutaneously once daily beginning either 48 hours before, 4 hours after, or 24 hours after virus inoculation. Treatment continued for 4 weeks and the virologic, immunologic, and clinical status of the macaques was monitored for up to 56 weeks. PMPA prevented SIV infection in all macaques without toxicity, whereas all control macaques became infected. These results suggest a potential role for PMPA prophylaxis against early HIV infection in cases of known exposure."

The codon for this arginine is introduced at the precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) stage by site-selective adenosine editing of a glutamine codon. Heterozygous mice engineered by gene targeting to harbor an editing-incompetent GluR-B allele synthesized unedited GluR-B subunits and, in principal neurons and interneurons, expressed AMPA receptors with increased calcium permeability. These mice developed seizures and died by 3 weeks of age, showing that GluR-B pre-mRNA editing is essential for brain function."

https://openalex.org/W2027091766,"The crystal structure of the aldehyde oxido-reductase (Mop) from the sulfate reducing anaerobic Gram-negative bacterium Desulfovibrio gigas has been determined at 2.25 A resolution by multiple isomorphous replacement and refined. The protein, a homodimer of 907 amino acid residues subunits, is a member of the xanthine oxidase family. The protein contains a molybdopterin cofactor (Mo-co) and two different [2Fe-2S] centers. It is folded into four domains of which the first two bind the iron sulfur centers and the last two are involved in Mo-co binding. Mo-co is a molybdenum molybdopterin cytosine dinucleotide. Molybdopterin forms a tricyclic system with the pterin bicycle annealed to a pyran ring. The molybdopterin dinucleotide is deeply buried in the protein. The cis-dithiolene group of the pyran ring binds the molybdenum, which is coordinated by three more (oxygen) ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2010640765,"To analyze the rules that govern communication between eye and brain, visual responses were recorded from an intact salamander retina. Parallel observation of many retinal ganglion cells with a microelectrode array showed that nearby neurons often fired synchronously, with spike delays of less than 10 milliseconds. The frequency of such synchronous spikes exceeded the correlation expected from a shared visual stimulus up to 20-fold. Synchronous firing persisted under a variety of visual stimuli and accounted for the majority of action potentials recorded. Analysis of receptive fields showed that concerted spikes encoded information not carried by individual cells; they may represent symbols in a multineuronal code for vision."
https://openalex.org/W2025563408,"The Tat protein of bovine immunodeficiency virus (BIV) binds to its target RNA, TAR, and activates transcription. A 14-amino acid arginine-rich peptide corresponding to the RNA-binding domain of BIV Tat binds specifically to BIV TAR, and biochemical and in vivo experiments have identified the amino acids and nucleotides required for binding. The solution structure of the RNA-peptide complex has now been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. TAR forms a virtually continuous A-form helix with two unstacked bulged nucleotides. The peptide adopts a beta-turn conformation and sits in the major groove of the RNA. Specific contacts are apparent between critical amino acids in the peptide and bases and phosphates in the RNA. The structure is consistent with all biochemical data and demonstrates ways in which proteins can recognize the major groove of RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2014660851,"DEVELOPMENT and maintenance of the mammalian nervous system is dependent upon neurotrophic cytokines. One class of neurotrophic factor acts through receptor complexes involving the low-affinity leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor subunit (LIF-R)1–3. Members of this family of cytokines, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), have profound effects on the survival and maintenance of motor neurons4–10. Recently it was reported that mice lacking LIF-R die shortly after birth11 unlike mice lacking CNTF or LIF which are viable. Here we describe histopathological analyses of lifr mutants that reveal a loss >35% of facial motor neurons, 40% of spinal motor neurons and 50% of neurons in the nucleus ambiguus. These findings point to the existence of a ligand for LIF-R that is required for the normal development of motor neurons in both brainstem nuclei and spinal cord."

Complementary DNA encoding ovine AA-NAT was cloned. The abundance of AA-NAT messenger RNA (mRNA) during the day was high in the ovine pineal gland and somewhat lower in retina. AA-NAT mRNA was found unexpectedly in the pituitary gland and in some brain regions. The night-to-day ratio of ovine pineal AA-NAT mRNA is less than 2. In contrast, the ratio exceeds 150 in rats. AA-NAT represents a family within a large superfamily of acetyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W2040422211,"Gene rearrangement during the ontogeny of T- and B-cells generates an enormous repertoire of T-cell receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. Because of the error-prone nature of this rearrangement process, two-thirds of rearranged TCR and Ig genes are expected to be out-of-frame and thus contain premature terminations codons (ptcs). We performed sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction products from fetal and adult thymus and found that newly transcribed TCR-β pre-mRNAs (intron-bearing) are frequently derived from ptc-bearing genes but such transcripts rarely accumulate as mature (fully spliced) TCR-β transcripts. Transfection studies in the SL12.4 T-cell line showed that the presence of a ptc in any of several TCR-β exons triggered a decrease in mRNA levels. Ptc-bearing TCR-β transcripts were selectively depressed in levels in a cell clone that contained both an in-frame and an out-of-frame gene, thus demonstrating the allelic specificity of this down-regulatory response. Protein synthesis inhibitors with different mechanism of action (anisomysin, cycloheximide, emetine, pactamycin, puromycin, and polio virus) all reversed the down-regulatory response. Ptc-bearing transcripts were induced within 0.5 h after cycloheximide treatment. The reversal by protein synthesis inhibitors was not restricted to lymphoid cells, as shown with TCR-β and β-globin constructs transfected in HeLa cells. Collectively, the data suggest that the ptc-mediated mRNA decay pathway requires an unstable protein, a ribosome, or a ribosome-like entity. Protein synthesis inhibitors may be useful tools toward elucidating the molecular mechanism of ptc-mediated mRNA decay, an enigmatic response that can occur in the nuclear fraction of mammalian cells.

T-cell receptor (TCR) ( 1The abbreviations used are: TCRT-cell receptorVvariableJjoiningDdiversityCHXcycloheximideIgimmunoglobulinptc(s)premature termination codon(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase.) and immunoglobulin (Ig) genes undergo programmed rearrangement events during lymphocyte ontogeny. During this process, variable (V) elements are juxtaposed to joining (J) elements to create functional genes(1Hood L. Kronenberg M. Hunkapiller T.

The tremendous combinatorial possibilities afforded by this rearrangement mechanism permit the generation of a wide variety of antigen receptors. Additional variability is provided by the enzyme terminal transferase which introduces random nucleotides at the junctions between V, D, and, J elements(1Hood L. Kronenberg M. Hunkapiller T.

Immunol. 1986; 4: 529-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Variability is also engendered by the low fidelity of the rearrangement event itself; the borders of each element are not fixed, sometimes leading to small deletions at the junctions between the V, D, and J elements. The collective result of these insertional and deletional events is that a large fraction of rearrangement events will generate out-of-frame (nonproductive) genes that contain premature termination codons (ptcs).

Since out-of-frame TCR and Ig genes are commonly generated during normal lymphocyte development, there may exist a mechanism that diminishes the expression of these nonfunctional ptc-containing genes.

One approach toward analyzing mechanisms responsible for ptc-mediated decay is to study this event in simpler eukaryotic organisms that are more amenable to genetic analysis. Toward this end, it has been shown that Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans down-regulate ptc-bearing mRNAs (28Leeds P. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Culbertson M.R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 29Pulak R. Anderson P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1885-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 30Peltz S.W. He F.

In S. cerevisiae, the decay of ptc-bearing mRNAs appears to be a cytoplasmic event. Several genes have been identified (the upf and smg series) that participate in ptc-mediated mRNA decay in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans(28Leeds P. Peltz S.W. Jacobson A. Culbertson M.R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 29Pulak R. Anderson P. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 1885-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 30Peltz S.W. He F.

Determination of the precise functional role of the upf and smg proteins may contribute greatly to our understanding of this novel regulatory process. Vertebrates may use a ptc-mediated decay mechanism that differs from the down-regulatory mechanism in lower eukaryotic cells. In vertebrates it has been shown that many ptc-bearing mRNAs are degraded in the nuclear fraction, rather than the cytoplasmic fraction. Preferential nuclear degradation has been demonstrated for ptc-bearing triosephosphate isomerase, dihydrofolate reductase, β-globin, v-src, major urinary protein (MUP), and Ig transcripts (9, 12, 14-17, 20, 23, 24, 26). This is an unexpected observation, since termination codons are generally considered to be recognized only by ribosomes in the cytoplasm. Several models have been put forward to explain how ptcs could affect nuclear events (see “Discussion”). In order to elucidate the novel mechanism that is responsible for the recognition and decay of ptc-bearing mRNAs in vertebrates, it is necessary to identify a system that efficiently down-regulates such aberrant mRNAs. In addition, the identification of an approach to reverse the down-regulatory response would be a useful tool toward understanding the underlying mechanism and its associated components. In our previous work (33Wilkinson M.F. MacLeod C.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 34Qian L. Theodor L. Carter M. Vu M.N. Sasaki A.W. Wilkinson M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1686-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) we showed that mature mRNA derived from a transcriptionally active TCR-β gene in the SL12.4 T-lymphoma cell clone failed to accumulate in the cytoplasm, although TCR splicing intermediates were easily detectable in the nucleus. We showed that incubation of SL12.4 cells with several different protein synthesis inhibitors dramatically induced the accumulation of mature TCR transcripts in the cytoplasm(35Qian L. Vu M.N. Carter M.S. Doskow J. Wilkinson M.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6801-6814PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the rearranged TCR-β gene in the SL12.4 T cell clone is out-of-frame and therefore contains ptcs. We then demonstrate in transfection experiments that the inducibility by protein synthesis inhibitors is exclusively restricted to ptc-bearing TCR-β transcripts. Protein synthesis inhibitors efficiently reversed the down-regulatory effect of ptcs in any of a number of TCR exons. The reversal of ptc-mediated mRNA decay by protein synthesis inhibitors was a general response that was not restricted to particular stages of T-cells, nor was it restricted to lymphoid cells. The ability to reverse this response may be useful toward studying the molecular mechanism of nonsense codon-mediated decay in the nucleus of vertebrate cells. Since nonfunctional ptc-bearing TCR genes are generated as a part of normal thymic ontogeny, we then asked if this down-regulatory mechanism operates in normal T-cells in vivo. We show that although ptc-bearing TCR-β genes are transcribed normally and give rise to normal levels of pre-mRNA in the thymus, that the levels of mature mRNA derived from these nonfunctional genes is selectively depressed. This constitutes the first in vivo evidence in higher eukaryotes that the ptc-mediated mRNA decay pathway selectively depresses mature mRNA levels, not pre-mRNA levels. Our findings reveal new insights into the ptc-induced down-regulatory mechanism and serve to further generalize the importance of this mechanism. The SL12.4, RS4.2, and AKR1 murine T-lymphoma cell clones were cultured as described previously(33Wilkinson M.F. MacLeod C.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Wilkinson M.F. MacLeod C.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for 2 h at a concentration (100 μg/ml) that we have previously shown is sufficient to inhibit protein synthesis (as assessed by [35S]methionine incorporation) by >95%(33Wilkinson M.F. MacLeod C.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Wilkinson M.F. MacLeod C.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Stable transfections of the T-lymphoma cell clones were performed by electroporating 5-20 μg of DNA in 1 × HBS buffer (280 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.05) with a Moonlight Cat Door electroporator (Seattle, WA) at 2900-3200 V. After transfection, the cells were split at different dilutions (1:5 to 1:100) among the wells in a 24-well plate. The antibiotic G418 (800 μg/ml) was added the following day, and after 12-20 days of selection in the presence of the antibiotic, all wells with viable cells were tested for expression of the constructs by Northern blot analysis. For any given construct, at least two independent wells were shown to express the construct and display the regulatory response to CHX shown in the figures. Cytoplasmic RNA from the T-lymphoma cell lines was prepared as described(33Wilkinson M.F. MacLeod C.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were stably transfected with 5-20 μg of DNA by calcium phosphate precipitation(37Kriegler M.P. Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual. Stockon, New York1990: 96-98Crossref Google Scholar), and individual stably transfected clones were isolated for Northern blot analysis. Transient transfections were performed by electroporation with an Invitrogen Electroporator II according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego). Total cellular RNA was harvested 2 days after transfection. For polio virus infection, near confluent HeLa cells were infected with polio virus type I (Mahoney strain) at a concentration of 75 plaque-forming unit/cell. The virus was incubated with the HeLa cells for 30 min at room temperature, followed by addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum (designated time point 0 of the infection). Total RNA from HeLa cells was prepared as described(33Wilkinson M.F. MacLeod C.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic RNA was prepared by lysis in 0.6% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 8), 0.1 mM EDTA. RNA was electrophoresed, blotted, and probed as described(34Qian L. Theodor L. Carter M. Vu M.N. Sasaki A.W. Wilkinson M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1686-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The relative amount of RNA loaded per lane was assessed by methylene blue staining of the rRNA content (38Wilkinson M. Doskow J. Lindsey S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 19: 679Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) as well as hybridization with the housekeeping genes cyclophillin and CHO-A(39Harpold M.M. Evans R.M. Salditt-Georgleff M.

The following oligonucleotides were used: Vβ5, sense orientation (ends at the -9 position with respect to the initiator ATG of Vβ5.1), CAAGAGACAGTATCTGA; Vβ8-A, sense (Vβ8.1 exon, corresponds to amino acids G42-Y48), GGGCTGAGGCTGATCCATTA; Vβ8-B, sense (corresponds to amino acids G58-G63), AGGAGATATCCCTGATGG; Vβ8-C, sense (begins 7 nucleotides downstream of the TATA box), CAGGGCTGGAACATACG; Vβ8-D, antisense (begins at amino acid 59), ATCTCCTTTCTCCGTGC; Vβ8-E, antisense (corresponds to amino acids D53-H47), GTCAGCGAC(C/G/T)TATGAGTAATG (the underlined nucleotide(s) denotes the site of mutagenesis); I-Jβ-A, antisense (intron sequence 13-32 nucleotides upstream of Jβ1.3 exon), CTGCAACCTAGGCACCTCAGAGAG; I-Jβ-B, antisense (intron sequence 40-63 nucleotides upstream of Jβ1.3, includes KpnI site at 5′ end), ACAGGTACCCAGTACCCAGCCATTTG; E1-A, antisense (Cβ1 exon 1, nucleotides 2-23, includes SacII site at 5′ end), ACACCGCGGTGGAGTCACATTTCTCAGAT; E1-B, antisense (Cβ1 exon 1, nucleotides 25-47, 2 nucleotide mismatch to generate SacI site), GAGAGCTCAAACAAGGAGACCTT; E2, antisense (Cβ1 exon 2, nucleotides 1-17), TGAGGTAATCCCACAGT; glob, antisense (corresponds to amino acids F42-P36 of human β-globin), AAGAACCTCTAGGTCCAAGG. The sequence information used to design the oligonucleotides was obtained from the following sources: Vβ8.1, Vβ8.2, and Vβ8.3(40Chou H.S. Anderson S.J. Louie M.C. Godambe S.A. Pozzi M.R. Behlke M.A. Huppi K. Loh D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1992-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), Cβ1 and Jβ1(41Gascoigne N.R.J. Chien Y. Becker D.M. Kavaler J. Davis M.M.

Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The Vβ5 oligonucleotide was designed on the basis of our own sequence analysis of cloned Vβ5.1 genomic DNA. Total cellular RNA (1 μg) from fetal (day 16 post-coitum) or adult thymus from BALB/c mice was used to prepare cDNA. To analyze Vβ8 mRNAs, reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed as described (35Qian L. Vu M.N. Carter M.S. Doskow J. Wilkinson M.F. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6801-6814PubMed Google Scholar) using oligo(dT) as a primer for cDNA synthesis and the following oligonucleotides for the PCR reaction (40 cycles). Mature Vβ8.1, Vβ8.2, and Vβ8.3 transcripts were amplified using oligonucleotides Vβ8-A + E1-A. Pre-mRNA transcripts were amplified using either oligonucleotide Vβ8-A + I-Jβ-A, oligonucleotide Vβ8-A + I-Jβ-B, or by nested PCR using Vβ8-A + I-Jβ-B (10 cycles), followed with Vβ8-B + I-Jβ-B (30 cycles). Anchored PCR was performed according the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends. In brief, cDNA was generated using a primer complementary to TCR-β sequences, the cDNA was dC-tailed with terminal transferase, then PCR was performed using an “anchor primer” (complementary to the C-tail) and an oligonucleotide complementary with TCR-β mRNA. For TCR-β mature mRNA, the E1-A oligonucleotide was used for cDNA synthesis and the E1-B oligonucleotide was used for PCR. For TCR-β pre-mRNA, the I-Jβ-B oligonucleotide was used to generate cDNA, and the I-Jβ-A was used for PCR. The PCR products were subcloned into Bluescript KS (Strategene Inc.), followed by dideoxy sequencing analysis. The sequences obtained were compared with known Vβ, Dβ, Jβ, and Cβ sequences (40Chou H.S. Anderson S.J. Louie M.C. Godambe S.A. Pozzi M.R. Behlke M.A. Huppi K. Loh D.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1984; 310: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) to determine whether the V(D)Jβ exon was in-frame with respect to the Cβ first exon. N-region diversity was observed at the V, D, and J junctions of most PCR products. The sequence of the V, D, and J elements was as reported in the literature, except that polymorphisms were sometimes noted for Jβ1.2 (nucleotide 14 (C) was deleted) and Jβ1.5 (a G was inserted after the T residue at position 9). When several identical sequences were obtained from a given PCR reaction, only one sequence was considered in the results shown in Table 1.TABLE I Open table in a new tab To obtain the sequence of the VJ junctional region in the Vβ5.1Cβ1 transcript in the SL12.4 cell clone, cDNA was prepared using 1 μg of RNA from SL12.4 cells treated for 6 h with CHX (100 μg/ml). Oligo(dT) was used as a primer for cDNA synthesis, and the oligonucleotides Vβ5 and E2 were used for PCR. A productively rearranged Vβ8.1Dβ2Jβ2.3Cβ2 genomic fragment was subcloned into pUC13 (obtained from M. Blackman, P. Marrack, and J. Kappler). The β-actin promoter region of pHβAPr-1 (43Gunning P. Leavitt J. Muscat G. Ng S. Kedes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4831-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) was removed by EcoRI/BamHI digestion and replaced with the multiple cloning site of Bluescript KS present on a 0.5-kb PvuII fragment. An 18-kb KpnI/SalI fragment, derived from pVβ8Cβ2, that contains Vβ8.1Dβ2Jβ2.3Cβ2 and the downstream enhancer, was subcloned into pNEO. A 3.2-kb KpnI/ClaI fragment, containing the Vβ8.1Dβ2Jβ2.3 region, subcloned into a modified version of Bluescript KS that lacked sequences between the EcoRV and SmaI sites. 10-nucleotide XhoI linkers were introduced into the unique EcoRV site within the Vβ8.1 exon of pVDJ. The number of XhoI linkers inserted into individual recombinant clones was determined by DNA sequence analysis. A 3.2-kb KpnI/ClaI fragment that contains the Vβ8.1Dβ2Jβ2.3 region was released from pRV and used to replace the analogous region of pVβ8Cβ2. An 18-kb KpnI/SalI fragment that contains the entire gene was then excised and subcloned into pNEO. pStu was generated analogously to pRV except that a single XhoI linker was introduced into the unique StuI site. A 2-kb PstI Cβ2 fragment subcloned into the PstI site of pKS. The Vβ8.1Dβ2Jβ2.3 region of pStu was subcloned into pCβ2 cut with KpnI and ClaI. A 0.8-kb BamHI fragment containing the TCR-β enhancer was then subcloned into the unique BamHI site downstream of Cβ2. The Vβ8.1Dβ2Jβ2.3Cβ2 region was then excised with XbaI and KpnI, and this 6-kb fragment was subcloned into pNEO. A fragment containing Cβ2 exons 1 and 2 was released from pCβ2 by linearizing with BglII, followed by S1 nuclease treatment and digestion with XhoI. This 1.25-kb blunt-end/XhoI fragment was subcloned into Bluescript KS at the XhoI and EcoRV sites. To introduce a frameshift, the plasmid was then linearized with NcoI, made blunt with Klenow enzyme, and religated to create a four nucleotide insertion at the NcoI site (confirmed by sequence analysis). A promoterless Vβ8.1 fragment was generated by PCR using pVDJ as a template and oligonucleotides Vβ8-C and -D. The PCR fragment was blunt-ended and inserted into Bluescript KS at the StuI and EcoRV sites. pVDJ was digested with NdeI and BamHI and the 2.8-kb fragment inserted into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pΔPrVβ8. pΔPrStu was created analogous to pΔPrVDJ except that a pStu NdeI/BamHI fragment was used. pΔPrVDJ was digested with SalI and BamHI, and the 3.2-kb fragment was inserted into the SalI and BamHI sites of pHβApr-1. pAc/FS2 was created analagous to pAC/IF except that a pΔPrStu SalI/BamHI fragment was used. pAc/IFΔ is identical to pAc/IF except that it contains a deletion between the PmlI site in Cβ2 exon 1 and the BsaBI site in Cβ2 exon 4. The human β-globin gene was isolated from pβglobin/pSP64 (42Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Ruskin B. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 993-1005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) with HindIII and PstI, subcloned into pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI), then released with HindIII and BglII and subcloned into pNEO. A β-globin gene fragment containing exons 1 and 2 was released from pβglobin/pSP64 with HindIII and DraI, the ends were filled in by Klenow, and the 1.1-kb fragment was subcloned into Bluescript KS at the EcoRV site. A nonsense mutation (UAG) was created at codon 39 using the Bio-Rad mutagenesis kit (Hercules, CA) with the oligonucleotide glob, the 1.1-kb insert was released with HindIII and BamHI and subcloned into pNEO. This construct was then linearized with BamHI and a 1.6-kb fragment containing the 3′ end of β-globin was subcloned into the BamHI site. Codon 50 in pVDJ was mutated using the oligonucleotide Vβ8-E by the approach described for pGLOB39. A 3.2-kb KpnI-ClaI fragment containing this mutation was used to replace the equivalent region in pFS2. pUAC was generated in the same manner as pUAA. The TCR-β gene undergoes programmed rearrangement events as T-lymphocytes migrate through the thymic environment(2Kronenberg M. Siu G. Hood L.E. Shastri N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 529-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). First, Dβ and Jβ elements are joined, followed by juxtaposition of the fused DJβ element with any one of several Vβ gene elements (in some cases, Jβ elements are fused directly to Vβ elements). As a result of the sequence variation at the V-D, D-J, or V-J junctions, out-of-frame TCR-β genes are commonly generated containing a ptc in either the V(D)Jβ exon or the first Cβ exon. To determine if a down-regulatory mechanism depresses the expression of such out-of-frame TCR-β transcripts in vivo, we assessed the relative levels of in-frame and out-of-frame TCR-β mRNA by sequence analysis of reverse transcriptase-PCR products from fetal and adult thymus. TCR-β pre-mRNA and mature mRNA molecules were independently assessed using a 3′ primer complementary to either exon or intron sequences, respectively. The 5′ primers included a pan-Vβ8 primer used to amplify Vβ8.1, Vβ8.2, and Vβ8.3 transcripts or an anchor primer used to amplify random Vβ transcripts. Sequence analysis of the reverse transcriptase-PCR products from adult thymus showed that 43% of Vβ pre-mRNAs were out-of-frame (Table 1). This proportion of out-of-frame pre-mRNAs is similar to the percentage of TCR-β genes known to be out-of-frame in thymocytes. Mallick et al.(44Mallick C.A. Dudley E.C. Viney J.L. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 513-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) showed that the average frequency of out-of-frame Vβ2, Vβ4, Vβ5, Vβ10, and Vβ16 genes in the adult mouse thymus is 25%. The reason that the percentage of out-of-frame TCR-β genes was not the theoretically expected value of 67% may be because T-cells which have generated nonproductive rearrangements on both chromosomes do not survive and thus do not contribute to the gene pool (44Mallick C.A. Dudley E.C. Viney J.L. Owen M.J. Hayday A.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 513-519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The proportion of out-of-frame pre-mRNA TCR-β transcripts that we found in the adult thymus differed strikingly from the value we determined for TCR-β mature mRNA. Of 28 independent mature cDNAs sequenced, none were out-of-frame (Table 1). The samples sequenced included Vβ8.1, Vβ8.2, and Vβ8.3 transcripts, as well as random Vβ transcripts detected by anchored PCR. The proportion of in-frame and out-of-frame TCR transcripts was also determined in day 16 fetal thymus. At day 16 of gestation, the thymus is dominated by immature double-negative (CD4-CD8-) and double-positive (CD4+CD8+) thymocytes that might be subject to different regulation than more mature thymocytes. Our analysis revealed that TCR-β pre-mRNAs were commonly out-of-frame (38%), but mature mRNAs rarely were (4%; Table 1). Collectively, the results show that both fetal and adult thymus actively transcribe in-frame and out-of-frame TCR-β genes but selectively depresss the levels of mature out-of-frame transcripts. To study the mechanism responsible for the decreased abundance of out-of-frame TCR-β mRNAs, we assessed the expression of TCR-β constructs in stably transfected T-cell lines. First, the expression of several frameshifted versions of a Vβ8.1Dβ2Jβ2.3Cβ2 (Vβ8) gene were compared with the in-frame version of this gene. These frameshifted genes possessed ptcs in either the VDJβ exon, the Cβ2.1 e"

M., Kedishvili, N. Y., Zhao, Y., Gudi, R., and Harris, R. A.(1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29720-29724). The present study was undertaken to further explore the diversity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase gene family. Here we report the deduced amino acid sequences of three isoenzymic forms of PDK found in humans. In terms of their primary structures, two isoenzymes identified in humans correspond to rat PDK1 and PDK2, whereas a third gene (PDK3) encodes for a new isoenzyme that shares 68% and 67% of amino acid identities with PDK1 and PDK2, respectively. PDK3 cDNA expressed in Escherichia coli directs the synthesis of a polypeptide with a molecular mass of approximately 45,000 Da that possesses catalytic activity toward kinase-depleted pyruvate dehydrogenase. PDK3 appears to have the highest specific activity among the three isoenzymes tested as recombinant proteins.Tissue distribution of all three isoenzymes of human PDK was characterized by Northern blot analysis. The highest amount of PDK2 mRNA was found in heart and skeletal muscle, the lowest amount in placenta and lung. Brain, kidney, pancreas, and liver expressed an intermediate amount of PDK2 (brain > kidney = pancreas > liver). The tissue distribution of PDK1 mRNA differs markedly from PDK2. The message for PDK1 was expressed predominantly in heart with only modest levels of expression in other tissues (skeletal muscle > liver > pancreas > brain > placenta = lung > kidney). In contrast to PDK1 and PDK2, which are expressed in all tissues tested, the message for PDK3 was found almost exclusively in heart and skeletal muscle, indicating that PDK3 may serve specialized functions characteristic of muscle tissues. In all tissues tested thus far, the level of expression of PDK2 mRNA was essentially higher than that of PDK1 and PDK3, consistent with the idea that PDK2 is a major isoenzyme responsible for regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in human tissues. Recent evidence from this laboratory indicates that at least two isoenzymic forms of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK1 and PDK2) may be involved in the regulation of enzymatic activity of mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by phosphorylation (Popov, K.

Buxton D.B. Robertson J.G. Olson M.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 497-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). The enzymatic activity of PDH is controlled by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle(2Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 62: 227-233Crossref Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 3Linn T.C. Pettit F.H. Hucho F. Reed L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Roche T.E. Burgett M.W. Pelley J.W. Reed L.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 328-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of PDH that leads to the complete inactivation of its enzymatic activity is catalyzed by a highly specific pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)(6Stepp L.R. Pettit F.H. Yeaman S.J. Reed L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9454-9458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Popov K.M. Shimomura Y. Harris R.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation with concomitant reactivation is catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase(8Teague W.W. Pettit F.H. Wu T.-L. Silberman S.R. Reed L.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5585-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Denton R.M. Randle P.J. Martin B.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that the phosphorylation state of PDH in mitochondria is determined by the activity of its intrinsic kinase, which itself is regulated by the products and substrates of the dehydrogenase reaction(10Hansford R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5483-5489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cate R.L. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 496-503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kerbey A.L. Randle P.J. Cooper R.H. Whitehouse S. Pask H.T. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 327-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The products stimulate the kinase activity, whereas the substrates are inhibitory. The kinase activity is also inhibited by ADP (competitive with ATP) that acts synergistically with pyruvate(13Pratt M.L. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7191-7196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in mitochondria, the steady state activity of the kinase should depend on intramitochondrial ratios of CoA/acetyl-CoA, NAD+/NADH, and ADP/ATP, as well as on the intramitochondrial concentration of pyruvate.Recent evidence from this laboratory indicates that, at least in rodents, there are two isoenzymic forms of PDK sharing up to 70% of amino acid identity(14Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These isoenzymes of PDK have been designated as PDK1 and PDK2. Both isoenzymes, obtained as the recombinant proteins, were found able to catalyze the phosphorylation and inactivation of PDH(14Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of isoenzymes appeared to be quite different. By Northern blot analysis, the isoenzyme PDK1 was found to be expressed predominantly in cardiac muscle. The isoenzyme PDK2, in contrast, is highly expressed in all tissues tested thus far, therefore suggesting that PDK2 may be responsible for regulation of the enzymatic activity of PDH complex in most of the tissues(14Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, some recent immunological evidence indicates that PDK2 corresponds to one of the subunits of PDK from bovine kidney mitochondria (16Priestman D.A. Mistry S.C. Halsall A. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and also corresponds to the free catalytic subunit of PDK identified by Randle's laboratory in rat liver mitochondria(14Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Priestman D.A. Mistry S.C. Kerbey A.L. Randle P.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).The physiological significance for existence of isoenzymes of PDK has not been established. Moreover, to date, it has not been shown whether isoenzymes of PDK exist in other mammalian species besides rodents. In the present study, we further explored the diversity of the PDK gene family. Here we report the data on the primary structures of three isoenzymic forms of PDK found in humans, one of which is a new isoenzyme of PDK, along with data on their tissue distribution and catalytic activities.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPolymerase Chain ReactionThe gene-specific oligonucleotide primers (AA(A/G) AA(C/T) GCN ATG CGN (or AG(A/G)) GCN AC) and (GGN CGN GTN GA(A/G) (or CT(A/G)) TAC AT(A/G) TA) for PCR were designed according to the amino acid sequences corresponding to the conserved subdomains II (-KNAMRAT-) and IV (-YMYSTAP-) of mitochondrial protein kinases. These primers were used to amplify human liver QUICK-Clone cDNA obtained from Clontech Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Each reaction mixture contained 50 pmol of each gene-specific primer, 1 ng of double-stranded cDNA along with deoxyribonucleic triphosphates, buffer, and 0.5 unit of Taq polymerase added according to the manufacturer's instructions (Perkin-Elmer). Forty cycles of PCR were performed using 1 min at 94°C for denaturation, 1 min at 52°C for annealing, and 1 min at 72°C for extension. The PCR products of approximately 180 bp were purified and subcloned in M13mp18 for sequencing.5′-Stretch λgt10 Human Liver cDNA Library ScreeningHuman liver cDNA library obtained from Clontech was screened with random-primed 32P-labeled cDNAs of rat PDK1, PDK2, or with partial cDNA of human PDK3 corresponding to PCR product obtained during amplification. Approximately 0.3-1.0 × 106 plaque-forming units of cDNA library were screened essentially as described by Sambrook et al.(18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 8.46-8.47Google Scholar). Hybridization conditions were as follows: 5 × SSPE (1 × SSPE = 180 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.7), 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% (w/v) Ficoll 400), 50% (v/v) formamide, 1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and the radiolabeled probe (2 × 106 cpm/ml) at 37°C for 17 h. The filters were washed with 6 × SSC (1 × SSC = 150 mM NaCl, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.5) containing 0.1% SDS four times at room temperature, two times with 2 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature, and two times with 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 42°C for 5 min. Positive plaques were purified through four more cycles of plating and screening. Respective cDNAs were cut out of λgt10 with EcoRI and religated in EcoRI-digested M13mp18 for sequencing.Rapid Amplification of 5′-End of PDK3 cDNA (5′-RACE)5′-RACE protocol was used in order to clone the 5′-end of human PDK3 cDNA. Human 5′-RACE-ready cDNA for this purpose was obtained from Clontech. The first round of amplification was performed following the manufacturer's instructions with gene-specific primer 1 (CTT AAT GGA TAA GTC TTC TTT ACC) corresponding to bases 850-871 of the PDK3 cDNA and the anchor primer (CTG GTT CGG CCC ACC TCT GAA GGT TCC AGA ATC GAT AG) obtained from Clontech. Gene-specific primer 2 corresponding to the positions 794-821 of PDK3 cDNA (CTC TTT TCT GTC TTC ATA GAG TTC) was used for the second round of amplification. PCR product of 821 bp was purified and subcloned in M13mp18 for sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of PCR products obtained from three independent amplifications were analyzed.Expression and Purification of PDK1, PDK2, and PDK3 cDNAs in E. coliPDK1, PDK2, and PDK3 cDNAs were expressed as described elsewhere. ( 2M. M. Bowker-Kinley and K. M. Popov, manuscript in preparation.) Briefly, SacI and XhoI restriction sites flanking the coding regions of rat PDK1 and PDK2 cDNAs, as well as the cDNA for human PDK3, were constructed by PCR. Resulting SacI/XhoI fragments were ligated in pET-28a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), cut with SacI and XhoI. In order to facilitate the purification of the recombinant isoenzymes of PDK, the stretches of six consecutive histidine residues (His•Tag) were constructed at the amino termini of the respective proteins. The resulting plasmids pPDK1, pPDK2, and pPDK3 were expressed in Escherichia coli HMS 174 (DE3) (Novagen) as described(14Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant proteins was achieved by chromatography on His•Bind resin (Novagen)(19Hochuli E. Bannwarth W.

Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1321-1325Crossref Scopus (957) Google Scholar).PDK Activity AssayATP-dependent inactivation of the kinase-depleted PDH complex in the presence of recombinant PDK1, PDK2, or PDK3 was assayed essentially as described previously(7Popov K.M. Shimomura Y. Harris R.A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).DNA SequencingSingle-stranded M13 DNA was prepared and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52357) Google Scholar) with Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.).Northern Blot AnalysisHuman multiple tissue Northern blots were obtained from Clontech. Blots were probed with random-primed 32P-labeled cDNAs of PDK1, PDK2, and PDK3, respectively. Hybridization conditions were as follows: 5 × SSPE, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1.0% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.1 mg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA, and radiolabeled probe (1.0-1.5 × 106 cpm/ml) at 42°C for 12 h. Blots were washed four times in 2 × SSC with 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature and two times in 0.1 × SSC with 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 55°C for 5 min and then exposed to x-ray film overnight at -70°C.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMolecular Cloning of Human PDK1, PDK2, and PDK3 cDNAsAmplification of the human liver cDNA with primers designed according to the sequences of conserved subdomains II and IV of mitochondrial protein kinases gave rise to a PCR product of the expected size of approximately 180 bp. Sequence analysis revealed that the obtained PCR product is a mixture of three cDNAs (data not shown). Two of them appeared to be almost identical with the cDNAs of PDK1 and PDK2 previously identified in rat tissues. The third cDNA, in spite of the high resemblance to cDNAs for PDK1 and PDK2, encoded for a different protein, indicating that multiple isoenzymes of PDK found previously in rodents (14Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) do exist in humans as well. Moreover, these experiments yielded a new isoenzyme of PDK that has not been identified in rat tissues.In order to obtain the full-length cDNAs encoding for human isoenzymes homologous to rat PDK1 and PDK2, human liver cDNA library was screened with corresponding rat cDNAs. Two positive clones were obtained during screening with PDK1 cDNA. One of the clones contained a cDNA of 1,593 bp that encodes for the full-length protein product with a molecular mass of 49,244 Da corresponding to the human PDK1. Screening of human liver cDNA library with cDNA of rat PDK2 yielded eight positive clones. Six of them appeared to be partial clones, whereas two contained cDNAs of 1,330 and 1,422 bp that encode a full-length protein with a molecular mass of 46,181 Da homologous to the rat PDK2.In order to clone a full-length cDNA of PDK3, human liver cDNA library was screened with the unique partial cDNA obtained by PCR as discussed above. Only one positive clone was found after screening of approximately 1.0 × 106 plaque-forming units, indicating that this cDNA is under-represented in the liver library. The analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the respective cDNA (914 bp long) revealed that it encodes for the carboxyl terminus of PDK3. The 5′-end of PDK3 cDNA was obtained by using a 5′-RACE protocol. Amplification of human heart templates with primers described under “Experimental Procedures” gave rise to an 821-bp-long PCR product that encodes for the complete 5′-coding region of PDK3 cDNA, as well as for the 5′-noncoding region. Further attempts to amplify the 5′-noncoding region of PDK3 cDNA with primers located near the 5′-end failed to produce products longer than expected from the sequence of 821-bp cDNA, suggesting that it covers almost the entire 5′-noncoding region. The resulting 1599-bp-long composite cDNA for PDK3 was constructed by aligning the 821-bp 5′-RACE product with the 914-bp cDNA obtained during library screening. It encodes for a protein with molecular mass of 46,938 Da.Primary Structures of Human PDK1, PDK2, and PDK3Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of human PDK1 and PDK2 revealed an extremely high resemblance to their rat counterparts. The identity between human and rat PDK2 is as great as 96% (Fig. 1). For human isoenzyme PDK1 the percent identity with the homologous rat isoenzyme was found to be somewhat lower, approximately 93%, due to the differences within the sequences of leader peptide. PDK3 shares 68% and 67% identity with PDK1 and PDK2, respectively. The same range of similarity was found previously between rat PDK1 and PDK2, clearly indicating that PDK3 is a new isoenzyme of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.Five regions of an extremely high conservation that presumably define the putative catalytic domain of mitochondrial protein kinases were identified in previous studies(14Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Gudi R. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29720-29724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13129-13130Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar): subdomain I defined by an invariant histidine residue (His155, numbering here and below is in accord with the mature sequence of rat PDK2); subdomain II defined by an invariant asparagine residue (Asn247); subdomain III corresponding to the first glycine rich loop Asp282-X-Gly284-X-Gly286; subdomain IV defined by aromatic residue (Tyr298); and subdomain V corresponding to the second glycine rich loop Gly317-X-Gly319-X-Gly321-Lys322-Pro323. As expected from these observations, the sequences corresponding to subdomains I, IV, and V are perfectly conserved among all isoenzymes of human PDK (Fig. 1). The minor differences were found within the sequences of subdomains II and III. It appeared that the alanine of subdomain II (-KNAMRAT-), as well as the arginine of subdomain III (-DRGGG-) of PDK3, are substituted to serine (-KNSMRAT-) and leucine (-DLGGG-), respectively. The lower level of conservation was observed only in rather short stretches of spacers connecting subdomains II and III, as well as subdomains IV and V (positions 263-276 and 315-321 of human PDK2, respectively). Surprisingly, an extremely high degree of conservation (up to 81%) was found within the amino termini of human isoenzymes of PDK (positions 26-73 of human PDK2), in spite of the fact that the overall level of conservation within this region of mitochondrial protein kinases is fairly low(15Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Presumably, it indicates that the amino terminus serves some specialized function characteristic of PDK, such as docking of the kinase to the complex. The greatest degree of divergency between the isoenzymes was found within the sequences immediately flanking subdomain I (positions 74-119 of PDK2). Taking into account that the invariant histidine residue of subdomain I (His123 of PDK2) may serve as a catalyst of the phosphotransfer reaction(21Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13129-13130Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), it seems reasonable to suggest that the differences within sequences flanking subdomain I may be directly responsible for the unique catalytic properties of the isoenzymes of PDK.2The structural motifs of mitochondrial protein kinases were identified based on the analysis of the amino acid sequences deduced from the nucleotide sequences of five genes available at that time: rat PDK1 and PDK2, rat branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase, hypothetical phosphoprotein 3 (HPP3) from Trypanosoma brucei and ZK370.5 from Caenorhabditis elegans (22, 23). However, with four more sequences available now for comparison (human isoenzymes of PDK and ORF of hypothetical protein YIL042C from yeast, GenBank™ accession number Z47047), additional structural motifs of the mitochondrial protein kinases become apparent (Fig. 1). The first motif defined by consensus sequence Ala123-X-Gly125-(Val/Lys)-X-Glu128 is localized immediately downstream from subdomain I. The second motif, corresponding to consensus Arg154-(Ile/Leu)-X-(Ile/Met)-(Arg/Lys)-(Met/Lys)-Leu160, is positioned in the middle of the spacer connecting the subdomains I and II. Two other consensus sequences Tyr328-(Ala/Leu)-X-(Tyr/Leu)-(Phe/Leu)-X-Gly334 and Gly343-X-Gly345-Thr346-Asp347, are situated within the carboxyl terminus of the kinase molecule and flank the catalytic domain on its carboxyl terminus. It is generally believed that regions of high conservation are important for catalytic function, either directly as components of the active site or indirectly by contributing structurally to the formation of the active site. The functional significance of subdomains of mitochondrial protein kinases identified through the comparison of their primary structures will be determined during future structure-functional analysis.The Catalytic Activity of the Recombinant Isoenzymes of PDKMost of the studies on the regulation of PDH activity have been performed on purified preparations of the PDH complex or on the mitochondria prepared from different tissues with unspecified isoenzymic composition of PDK. Thus, the question about the contribution of individual isoenzymes of PDK to the observed regulatory properties of the kinase has never been addressed. Since the cDNAs of individual isoenzymes of PDK are now available, it is possible to determine the contribution of each isoenzyme to the regulation of the PDH complex by characterizing the respective recombinant enzymes. In the present study we expressed the cDNAs of PDK1, PDK2, and the newly discovered PDK3 in E. coli, purified the recombinant proteins, and characterized their activities toward the kinase-depleted PDH complex.To facilitate the purification of recombinant PDK1, PDK2, and PDK3, stretches of six consecutive histidine residues (His•Tag) were constructed at the amino termini of the respective proteins. Corresponding His•Tagged kinases were purified from E. coli extracts in one step by using metal chelate chromatography. The recombinant kinases, purified in this way, were found to be more than 90% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 2). The electrophoretic mobility of purified PDK1 was found to be somewhat slower than that of PDK2, whereas PDK3 had electrophoretic mobility comparable to that of PDK2 in good agreement with previous estimates of the molecular weights of the respective isoenzymes based on the deduced amino acid sequences (in this manuscript and in (14Popov K.M.

Preparations of isoenzyme PDK1 appear to consist of several closely positioned bands on SDS gel (Fig. 2). This microheterogeneity was found to be due to phosphorylation occurring during expression.

Based on an ATP-dependent inactivation assay that measures the rate of ATP-dependent inactivation of PDH activity due to phosphorylation, PDK3 was found to be the most active isoenzyme. The enzymatic activity of PDK1 was approximately 30-50% lower than that of PDK3 in three independent experiments. The second isoform of PDK had the lowest basal activity of all three isoenzymes. However, it is generally believed that in mitochondria the rate of kinase activity depends upon the relative concentrations of products and substrates of the dehydrogenase reaction. The products, NADH and acetyl-CoA, activate PDK, whereas the substrates, pyruvate, NAD+, and CoA inhibit the kinase(1Behal R.H. Buxton D.B. Robertson J.G. Olson M.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 497-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, direct comparison of the basal activities of isoenzymes of PDK may be somewhat misleading. Accordingly, it was found that the enzymatic activity of isoenzyme PDK2, when it is tested in the presence of high ratios of NADH/NAD+ and acetyl-CoA/CoA, increases almost five times and approaches the activity of isoenzyme PDK1,2 thus indicating that isoenzymes of PDK are different not only in terms of their basal activities, but also in terms of regulation of their enzymatic activities by the compounds known to affect kinase activity in vivo.Figure 3:Time courses of the ATP-dependent inactivation of kinase-depleted PDH complex reconstituted with different isoenzymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase. 40 milliunits of kinase-depleted PDH was reconstituted with 0.5 μg of the recombinant PDK1 (○), PDK2 (□), or PDK3 (•), respectively, in 570 μl of the phosphorylation mixture containing 20 mM Tris•HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylation reactions were initiated with ATP (final concentration 100 μM) after a 5-min preincubation at room temperature. Aliquots of the phosphorylation mixture were withdrawn at indicated times for determination of the PDH residual activity. Each point represents an average from three independent expression experiments. Under comparable conditions of incubation, the kinase-depleted PDH complex itself did not show any inactivation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Tissue Distribution of Human PDK1, PDK2, and PDK3Tissue distribution of all three isoforms of human PDK was characterized by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4).

This β chain loss also occurred in IFN-γ-treated TH2 cells and thus represents a specific response of CD4+ T cells to IFN-γ rather than a TH1-specific differentiation event.

However, the biochemical events underlying these processes are not fully understood, and their contributions to the loss of signaling remain correlative. In addition, the nature of the kinases and the receptor domains which are involved in modulation of activity have only begun to be investigated. In order to directly measure the role of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) in the desensitization of the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (m2 mAChR), a dominant-negative allele of GRK2 was used to inhibit receptor phosphorylation by endogenous GRK activity in a human embryonic kidney cell line. The dominant-negative GRK2K220R reduced agonist-dependent phosphorylation of the m2 mAChR by ~50% and prevented acute desensitization of the receptor as measured by the ability of the m2 mAChR to attenuate adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast, the agonist-induced internalization of the m2 mAChR was unaffected by the GRK2K220R construct. Further evidence linking receptor phosphorylation to acute receptor desensitization was obtained when two deletions of the third intracellular loop were made which created m2 mAChRs that did not become phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner and did not desensitize. However, the mutant mAChRs retained the ability to internalize. These data provide the first direct evidence that GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation is necessary for m2 mAChR desensitization; the likely sites of in vivo phosphorylation are in the central portion of the third intracellular loop (amino acids 282-323).

High affinity was subsequently restored by optimizing the remaining noncritical residues by means of phage display. Residues that flanked the mini-ring structure were then deleted in stages, and affinity losses were rectified by additional phage-sorting experiments. Thus, structural and functional data on hormones, coupled with phage display methods, can be used to shrink the hormones to moieties more amendable to small-molecule design."
https://openalex.org/W1591741075,"Abstract Rapamycin is a potent immunosuppressant that binds to the cytosolic protein, FKBP12, and blocks T cell activation. Here we report that rapamycin also blocks myogenic proliferation and induces differentiation, associated with a decrease in p34cdc2 activity and cyclin A levels. In yeast and mammals, rapamycin blocks cell cycle progression by causing G1 arrest, arguing for a conserved signaling pathway governing the G1 to S transition. p34cdc2 has been shown to play a role in both the transition from G1 to S and from G2 to M in yeast. In higher eukaryotes the role of p34cdc2 in G1 to S transition is less clear. Rapamycin and the structurally related macrolide antibiotic FK506 both bind to a cytosolic protein, the FK506-binding protein (FKBP12). We show that inhibition of myogenic proliferation is achieved at low doses of rapamycin (< 1 ng/ml) and is competed by a molar excess of FK506, indicating specificity for FKBP12. The distinct FK506-calcineurin pathway did not affect myogenic proliferation, differentiation, or p34cdc2 kinase activity. Thus, the rapamycin-FKBP12 signaling pathway involves a specific and direct effect on p34cdc2 kinase activity at the G1 to S transition and identifies a regulatory step during myogenic differentiation."

Here we have studied human TN, and confirmed that the small variant binds preferentially to purified fibronectin and to fibronectin-containing extracellular matrix. Thus this differential binding appears to be conserved across vertebrate species. Using bacterial expression proteins, we mapped the major binding site to the third FN3 domain of TN. Consistent with this mapping, a monoclonal antibody against an epitope in this domain did not stain TN segments bound to cell culture matrix fibrils. The enhanced binding of the small TN variant suggests the existence of another, weak binding site probably in FN3 domains 6-8, which is only positioned to bind fibronectin in the small splice variant. This binding of domains 6-8 may involve a third molecule present in matrix fibrils, as the enhanced binding of small TN was much more prominent to matrix fibrils than to purified fibronectin."

In this report, we demonstrate that SIII stimulates promoter-specific transcription by increasing the overall rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II. Results of pulse-chase experiments indicate that SIII does not need to be present during preinitiation complex formation or transcription initiation in order to stimulate promoter-specific transcription. In addition, SIII is able to stimulate the rate of RNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II during transcription of double stranded oligo(dC)-tailed templates. Taken together, these findings indicate that the factor exerts its activity directly on the elongation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1496733957,"Abstract Obstacles incurred by RNA polymerase II during primary transcript synthesis have been identified in vivo and in vitro. Transcription past these impediments requires SII, an RNA polymerase II-binding protein. SII also activates a nuclease in arrested elongation complexes and this nascent RNA shortening precedes transcriptional readthrough. Here we show that in the presence of SII and nucleotides, transcript cleavage is detected during SII-dependent elongation but not during SII-independent transcription. Thus, under typical transcription conditions, SII is necessary but insufficient to activate RNA cleavage. RNA cleavage could serve to move RNA polymerase II away from the transcriptional impediment and/or permit RNA polymerase II multiple attempts at RNA elongation. By mapping the positions of the 3'-ends of RNAs and the elongation complex on DNA, we demonstrate that upstream movement of RNA polymerase II is not required for limited RNA shortening (seven to nine nucleotides) and reactivation of an arrested complex. Arrested complexes become elongation competent after removal of no more than nine nucleotides from the nascent RNA's 3'-end. Further cleavage of nascent RNA, however, does result in backward translocation of the enzyme. We also show that one round of RNA cleavage is insufficient for full readthrough at an arrest site, consistent with a previously suggested mechanism of SII action."

Furthermore, the simultaneous disruption of RAS1, RAS2, and the RAS-related gene RSR1 was lethal at any temperature. The triple-disrupted cells were arrested late in the mitotic (M) phase, which was accompanied by an accumulation of cells with divided chromosomes and sustained histone H1 kinase activity. The lethality of the triple disruption was suppressed by the multicopies of CDC5, CDC15, DBF2, SPO12, and TEM1, all of which function in the completion of the M phase. Mammalian ras also suppressed the lethality, which suggests that a similar signaling pathway exists in higher eukaryotes. These results demonstrate that S. cerevisiae Ras functions in the completion of the M phase in a manner independent of the Ras-cAMP pathway."

In the current report, we studied the expression of MHC class I proteins in BW wild type thymoma cells (BW WT) and glucosidase II-deficient BW PHAR2.7 cells. Consistent with a requirement for glucose (Glc) trimming for interaction of class I proteins with calnexin, we found that nascent H-2Kk proteins associated with calnexin in untreated BW WT cells, but not in BW WT cells treated with the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine (cas), or in untreated glucosidase II-deficient BW PHAR2.7 cells. Suprisingly, we found that H-2Kk expression occurred with similar efficiency in BW PHAR2.7 cells as in BW WT cells and that formation of nascent H-2Kk complexes was perturbed by cas treatment in BW WT cells but not in BW PHAR2.7 cells. Finally, it was noted that expression of the molecular chaperone Bip was markedly increased in BW PHAR2.7 cells relative to BW WT cells, which is suggested to play a role in regulating the expression of H-2Kk complexes in BW PHAR2.7 cells. The current study demonstrates that Glc trimming is required for efficient interaction of nascent H-2Kk proteins with calnexin; that expression of MHC class I proteins can, under certain conditions, proceed effectively in the absence of Glc trimming and calnexin association; and that Bip expression is markedly increased under conditions where diglucosylated glycans persist on nascent glycoproteins within the ER. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that alternative oligomerization pathways exist for class I proteins within the quality control system of the ER that have differential requirements for removal of Glc residues from nascent glycan chains.

https://openalex.org/W2062662915,"Transcriptional silencing at the HMRa locus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the function of the origin recognition complex (ORC), the replication initiator of yeast. Expression of a Drosophila melanogaster Orc2 complementary DNA in the yeast orc2-1 strain, which is defective for replication and silencing, complemented the silencing defect but not the replication defect; this result indicated that the replication and silencing functions of ORC were separable. The orc2-1 mutation mapped to the region of greatest homology between the Drosophila and yeast proteins. The silent state mediated by DmOrc2 was epigenetic; it was propagated during mitotic divisions in a relatively stable way, whereas the nonsilent state was metastable. In contrast, the silent state was erased during meiosis."
https://openalex.org/W1577064811,"The interaction of high density lipoprotein with its putative receptor stimulates translocation and efflux of intracellular sterols by a process involving activation of protein kinase C. This study shows that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase also stimulates efflux of intracellular sterols. When intracellular sterol pools of cholesterol-loaded cultured human skin fibroblasts and bovine aortic endothelial cells were radiolabeled with the biosynthetic precursor [3H]mevalonolactone, high density lipoprotein3 (HDL3)-mediated 3H-sterol efflux was enhanced by addition of the adenylylcyclase activator forskolin, the phosphodiesterase inhibitors theophylline and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and the cAMP analogues N6-benzoyl-cAMP (N6-cAMP) and 8-thiomethyl-cAMP. The effect of N6-cAMP was abolished by an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (H8). The enhanced sterol efflux was independent of receptor binding of HDL3, as similar effects were observed in the presence of tetranitromethane-modified HDL3, which lacks receptor binding activity. N6-cAMP stimulated efflux of several subspecies of newly synthesized sterols, including cholesterol. Elevation of cAMP levels increased the proportion of radiosterols that were accessible to treatment of cells with the enzyme cholesterol oxidase, suggesting that activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase stimulates translocation of sterols from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane where they desorb from the cell surface. Thus, at least two distinct protein kinase signalling pathways modulate transport of intracellular sterols in cholesterol-loaded cells."

We have studied the effects of different agents on the expression of the PLP gene in C6 glioma cells. Retinoic acid (RA), but not dexamethasone, estradiol, insulin, growth hormone, or vitamin D3, had a drastic effect, increasing 10-20-fold the level of PLP mRNA. Concomitantly, RA also induced the appearance of the corresponding immunoreactive protein. The increase in PLP RNA level showed a slow kinetics and was blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting a posttranscriptional regulation by RA. Nuclear run-on assays confirmed that the rate of PLP gene transcription was unchanged by RA. In contrast, we found that retinoic acid augmented PLP mRNA stability, causing a substantial increase in its half-life. RA action was independent of cell density, serum, or PDGF but was partially inhibited by bFGF. On the other hand, thyroid hormone caused a moderate increase in PLP mRNA levels in C6 cells but only when the low numbers of thyroid receptors in these cells were increased by retrovirally mediated expression of an exogenous c-erbA/TR alpha-1 gene. Our results indicate that RA specifically up-regulates PLP expression in glioma C6 cells at a posttranscriptional level by increasing PLP RNA half-life."
https://openalex.org/W1589704078,"The pancreatic zymogen granule membrane protein GP-2 was introduced into cells of exocrine or endocrine origin by transfection of its cDNA in order to investigate the mechanisms by which proteins are specifically incorporated into the membranes of secretory granules. Permanent transformants expressing GP-2 were isolated from exocrine pancreatic-derived AR42J cells as well as AtT20 cells of anterior pituitary origin and insulinoma-derived Rin5F cells. In AR42J cells, GP-2 was localized by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy to the endogenous zymogen-like granules as well as to the plasma membrane. In experiments supporting the localization data, incubation of the AR42J transformants with the secretagogue cholecystokinin (CCK8) resulted in enhanced release of a shed form of GP-2 into the medium in parallel with amylase, suggesting that the two proteins were secreted from the same compartment. By contrast, when expressed in AtT20 cells, the protein was found by immunofluorescence microscopy on the plasma membrane as well as in intracellular vesicles that differed in size and location from the endogenous secretory vesicles. By electron microscopy, large (approximately 0.5 micron) multivesicular structures were observed. Single- and double-label immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated that these large organelles labeled with anti-GP-2 antibodies, whereas the smaller adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-containing secretory vesicles did not. In permanent transformants of Rin5F cells, GP-2 was also excluded from the insulin-containing granules and found in multivesicular bodies similar to those in the AtT20 cells and containing the endosomal/lysosomal marker endolyn-78. Despite the apparent accumulation of GP-2 in lysosome-like structures, it turned over slowly and did not undergo rapid endocytosis from the cell surface. We conclude that GP-2 is targeted to secretory granule membranes by cell type-specific mechanisms that likely involve its interaction with other membrane or content proteins expressed only in the exocrine cells."

In this report, we further characterize the biochemical and functional properties of this newt KGFR. A stable Chinese hamster ovary transfectant overexpressing the newt KGFR was capable of binding both 125I-fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) and 125I-FGF-7 but not 125I-FGF-2, indistinguishable from the human KGFR. Scatchard analysis and cross-linking studies further support the conclusion that FGF-1 and FGF-7 are the ligands for the newt KGFR. In addition to their ability to bind to FGFs, both the human and the newt KGFR are also capable of repressing differentiation in mouse MM14 myoblasts. MM14 cells express FGFR1 and are repressed from differentiation by FGF-1, FGF-2, and FGF-4 but not FGF-7. Co-transfection of MM14 cells with either a human or newt KGFR expression construct conferred a response to FGF-7 as determined by a human α-cardiac actin/luciferase reporter construct. The response to FGF-7 was similar to the endogenous FGF response as FGF-7 prevented MM14 myoblasts from undergoing terminal differentiation. Thus, both the human and the newt KGFRs transduce signals similar to those transduced via the endogenous mouse FGFR1. Together these data indicate that this newly isolated newt KGFR is a functional receptor as it binds two FGF family members with high affinity and mediates signaling in skeletal muscle myoblasts.

The four receptors constitute a subclass of receptor tyrosine kinases that is characterized by three (or two) extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig domains), a membrane spanning region, and a cytoplasmic portion that contains a tyrosine kinase domain(10Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4593) Google Scholar). FGFRs 1-3, but not FGFR4, are subject to a high degree of alternative splicing of their primary transcripts that results in a multitude of combinatorial splice variants (reviewed in (11Johnson D.E. Williams L.T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar)). Alternative splicing within the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 can result in a kinase-defective molecule. Upon ligand binding this kinase-defective variant oligomerizes with a kinase-containing FGFR resulting in a heterodimer complex incapable of phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase Cγ(12Shi E. Kan M. Xu J. Wang F. Hou J. McKeehan W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the majority of alternative splicing events occur in the extracellular portion of the receptor.

In addition, the targeted expression of a dominant negative FGFR1 in the epidermis (36Werner S. Weinberg W. Liao X. Peters K.G. Blessing M. Yuspa S.H. Weiner R.L. Williams L.T.

FGFs and their receptors have been implicated in amphibian limb regeneration, a process which closely parallels normal limb development. Infusion of FGF into the distal stump of denervated newt limbs stimulates cell cycling over the depressed level normally observed after denervation(38Gospodarowicz D. Mescher A.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

We further showed that KGFR is the FGFR2 variant that is expressed in the basal layer of the wound epithelium(40Poulin M.L. Chiu I.-M. Dev. Dynamics. 1995; 202: 378-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to explore the functionality of the newt homolog of KGFR and its potential relevance in amphibian limb regeneration. Here we present data showing that the newt KGFR possesses the ability to bind specific members of the FGF family in a manner indistinguishable from its human counterpart. Moreover, the expression of this receptor in mouse MM14 myoblast cells represses terminal differentiation mediated by FGF-7. The isolation of overlapping, partial cDNAs encoding newt homologs of two FGFR2 splice variants bek and KGFR have been described elsewhere(22Poulin M.L. Patrie K.M. Botelho M.J. Tassava R.A.

These overlapping cDNAs were used to construct the full-length newt KGFR cDNA in pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene) by conventional DNA cloning techniques(41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The entire nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the newt KGFR have been determined(42Poulin M.L. Chiu I.-M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1220: 209-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The full-length receptor cDNA construct was excised from pBluescript with XhoI and NotI and directionally cloned into the XhoI-NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pBJ5 (43Lin A.Y. Devaux B. Green A. Sagerström C. Elliott J.F. Davis M.M. Science. 1990; 249: 677-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) to make the newt KGFR expression plasmid pNKGFR. Expression of cDNAs cloned into this vector are driven by the strong SRα hybrid promoter(44Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHKGFR is a human KGFR expression plasmid that contains a three Ig domain form of the human KGFR cDNA (18Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P.

The EcoRI site of a 245-base pair EcoRI/HindIII fragment of pHCA177CAT (45Minty A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell.

The resultant plasmid is designated α-cardiac actin/luciferase reporter. CHO-K1 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were maintained in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. CHO cells were cotransfected with 10 μg of pBJ5 or pNKGFR and 1 μg of pSV2neo using the modified calcium-phosphate precipitation method(46Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4815) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were placed under G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) selection (400 μg/ml) and colonies isolated 2 weeks later. Stable transfectants were maintained in media supplemented with G418 (400 μg/ml) and tested for the expression of newt KGFR by binding analysis. A pBJ5 transfectant (CHO/Control) and a newt KGFR expressing cell line (CHO/NKGFR) were selected for further study. NIH/3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. A transformed NIH/3T3 cell line, NIH/HKGFR(18Miki T. Bottaro D.P.

Mouse MM14 cells (47Linkhart T.A. Clegg C.H. Hauschka S.D. J. Supramol. Struct. 1980; 14: 483-498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cultured on gelatin-coated plates in growth medium consisting of Ham's F-10 supplemented with 0.8 mM CaCl2, 100 units/ml penicillin, 5 μg/ml streptomycin, and 15% horse serum. The concentration of FGF-2 was increased from 5 to 40 ng/ml with increasing cell density. Bovine brain FGF-1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis MN), human recombinant FGF-2(48Rapraeger A.C. Guimond D. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and human recombinant FGF-7 (Promega, Madison, WI) were iodinated using the chloramine-T method. Briefly, 2 μg of FGF were incubated together with 10 μl of 1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1 mCi of Na125I (Amersham), and 30 μl of 100 μg/ml chloramine T in a final volume of 70 μl for 90 s at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 20 mM dithiothreitol and further incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The iodination reaction was placed over a heparin-agarose column and washed with wash buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.4 M NaCl) to remove unincorporated 125I and biologically inactive 125I-FGF. Bound 125I-FGF was eluted off the column with elution buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, NaCl; the NaCl concentration varied depending on the 125I-FGF that was being eluted off the column: for FGF-1, 2.0 M; FGF-7, 1.0 M; FGF-2, 3.0 M). The biological activity of the labeled FGFs was ascertained by DNA synthesis assays on responsive cell lines. Specific activities ranged from 1 to 5 × 105 cpm/ng for 125I-FGF-1 and 125I-FGF-2 and 4 to 8 × 104 cpm/ng for 125I-FGF-7. Murine EGF (Promega) was used as a nonspecific competitor in the competition assays. The FGF-1 protein used in the skeletal muscle reporter gene activity assay was obtained from bovine brain as described elsewhere(48Rapraeger A.C. Guimond D. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 219-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NIH/3T3, NIH/HKGFR, CHO/NKGFR, and CHO/Control were seeded at a density of 7 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate. Twenty-four hours later the cells were washed twice with cold (4°C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with 125I-FGF in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (Ham's F-12 with 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.3, 0.15% gelatin, and 10 μg/ml heparin) for 2 h at 4°C. Cells were then washed twice with PBS and once with either PBS, 1.0 M NaCl (125I-FGF-1); PBS, 0.5 M NaCl (125I-FGF-7); or PBS, 2.0 M NaCl (125I-FGF-2). Cells were then solubilized in 0.5 ml of 0.3 N NaOH and bound radioactivity counted on a Beckman γ-counter. The addition of a brief salt wash along with the presence of heparin in the binding buffer minimized low affinity binding of the tracers. For the qualitative binding assays, protein assays were then performed on the solubilized cells as described by the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Incubation of the cells with the labeled FGFs was carried out in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled FGF. Mean cpm bound per μg of total cell protein (±S.D.) was determined from triplicate samples. Specific binding is defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding. In the competition assays 125I-FGF-1 (2.3 ng/ml) or 125I-FGF-7 (3.4 ng/ml) was added to the wells in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled competitor. Duplicate wells were used for each concentration of unlabeled competitor. For the Scatchard analysis increasing amounts of 125I-FGF were added to duplicate wells with nonspecific binding counts obtained in parallel assays using 100-fold excess of unlabeled FGF. CHO/Control and CHO/NKGFR were seeded in 60-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 105 cells/dish. Twenty-four hours later cells were washed once with cold PBS and incubated with 1 × 106 cpm of labeled FGFs (in the absence or presence of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled FGFs) in 5.0 ml of binding buffer for 1 h at 4°C. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and labeled FGF was cross-linked to cell surface receptors by incubation with 5.0 ml of 0.3 mM disuccinimidyl suberate (diluted in PBS from a 30 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide) for 30 min at 4°C. Cells were then washed twice with cold PBS, scraped in 1.5 ml of PBS, and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g. The cell pellet was resuspended in 45 μl of lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Solubilized cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 × g and 40 μl of the clarified cell lysate transferred to 40 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE after which the gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film. MM14 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells per 100-mm dishes 6-8 h before transfection. A calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate containing 1 μg of α-cardiac actin/luciferase reporter construct (a gift from Dr. Stephen Konieczny, Purdue University) and 0.5 μg of CMV-LacZ (Centre Commercil de Gros (Toulouse, France)) with 15 μg of pBJ5, pNKGFR, or pHKGFR was prepared in 0.55 ml of HBS (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.05, 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 0.75 mM Na2HPO4, 6 mM dextrose) containing 0.11 M CaCl2. The cells were incubated with 0.5 ml of the precipitate for 20 min before addition of growth medium containing FGF-2. After 4 h, the cells were osmotically shocked for 2.5 min with 15% glycerol in HBS. Growth medium containing 1 μM insulin and 20 ng/ml FGF-1, FGF-2, or FGF-7 were added as indicated. Additional FGF-1, FGF-2, or FGF-7 was added every 12 h. The cells were harvested for assay of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities 36 h following the osmotic shock. Luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions except for the addition of 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 μg/ml leupeptin to the cell solubilization buffer. β-Galactosidase activity was determined in aliquots of the same lysates using the Galacto-Light chemiluminescent reporter assay system (TROPIX). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were quantitated in a Berthold Lumat luminometer. Reporter gene activity was calculated by dividing the values obtained for α-cardiac actin/luciferase activity by the CMV/β-galactosidase activity determined in each extract. The activity of the CMV promoter determined by the β-galactosidase assay in proliferating and differentiated MM14 cells varies less than 2-fold. ( 2K. Hannon, A. J. Kudla, M. J. McAvoy, K. L. Clase, and B. B. Olwin, manuscript submitted.) We have previously reported the isolation from the newt, Notophthalamus viridescens, of overlapping cDNAs which encode the amphibian homologs of two FGFR2 splice variants, bek and KGFR(22Poulin M.L. Patrie K.M. Botelho M.J. Tassava R.A. Chiu I.-M. Development. 1993; 119: 353-361PubMed Google Scholar). To address the question of whether the potential receptors are functional molecules, the overlapping cDNAs were used to construct the full-length receptors shown in Fig. 1A. The full-length newt KGFR cDNA was originally constructed in pBluescript and was subsequently cloned into the mammalian expression vector pBJ5. Cotransfection of CHO-K1 cells with pSV2neo and either the pBJ5 expression vector or the newt KGFR expression construct, pNKGFR, resulted in the isolation of stable G418-resistant transfectants CHO/Control and CHO/NKGFR, respectively. To evaluate the ability of the newt KGFR to bind to FGF-1 and FGF-7, a series of binding assays were performed on the CHO/Control and CHO/NKGFR cell lines using 125I-FGFs as tracers. As a comparison, a cell line overexpressing the human KGFR, NIH/HKGFR, and its parental NIH/3T3 cell line were used in these assays. The NIH/HKGFR cell line has been previously shown to bind to FGF-7 with high affinity(18Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M.-L. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In a qualitative binding assay the human KGFR showed a significant increase in binding to 125I-FGF-1 and 125I-FGF-7 relative to NIH/3T3 cells but was not capable of binding 125I-FGF-2 over that which was observed in the parental cell line (data not shown). These results confirmed the previously published results of this human FGFR2 splice variant(18Miki T. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Smith C.L. Burgess W.H. Chan A.M.-L. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Likewise, the newt KGFR expressing cell line, CHO/NKGFR, shows an increase in binding to 125I-FGF-1 and 125I-FGF-7 but not 125I-FGF-2 when compared to the expression vector transfected cell line, CHO/Control (Fig. 1B). Thus, the newt KGFR exhibits an FGF binding profile that is similar to its human counterpart. To determine the size of the newt KGFR expressed in the CHO/NKGFR cell line, a cross-linking analysis was performed. The predicted size of the newt KGFR based on the primary amino acid sequence of the cDNA is 82 kDa. When either 125I-FGF-1 or 125I-FGF-7 was cross-linked to the newt KGFR and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, a predominant cross-linked product with an apparent molecular mass of 165-170 kDa was detected (lanes 2, Fig. 2, A and B, respectively). Subtraction of the molecular mass of the ligands yields an estimated molecular mass of 150 kDa for the expressed receptor. The difference between the apparent and predicted molecular weights for newt KGFR is most likely due to an extensive degree of N-linked glycosylation in the extracellular domain. A cross-linked product is not observed in the CHO/Control cell line with either of the labeled FGFs (lanes 1, Fig. 2, A and B). Cross-linkings carried out in the presence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled FGFs indicate that the receptor is specific for FGF-1 and FGF-7 as both of the"

A number of distinct properties of VP16 have been implicated in the assembly of the VP16-induced complex (VIC). These include its independent association with VCAF-1 and, under appropriate conditions, its ability to bind to DNA or to DNA-bound Oct-1 in the absence of VCAF-1. In order to probe the requirements of these individual interactions in the functional asembly of VIC, we mutated selected charged amino acids in two subdomains of VP16 previously shown to be important in protein-DNA complex formation. Purified VP16 proteins were analyzed for their ability to direct protein-DNA complex formation and to interact directly with VCAF-1. Several classes of mutants that were differentially compromised in VCAF-1 interaction, direct DNA binding, and/or association with DNA-bound Oct-1 were obtained. Interestingly, all of the derivatives were still capable of generating the VIC complex in vitro and activating transcription in vivo. Our findings indicate that the cooperative assembly of functional VP16-containing complexes can occur by pathways that do not necessarily require the prior interaction of VP16 with VCAF-1 or the ability of VP16 to bind directly to DNA or associate with DNA-bound Oct-1.

VP16 is an abundant 490-amino acid-long structural phosphoprotein which, when delivered into the host cell by the infecting virus particle, strongly stimulates the transcription of the viral IE genes through recognition of cis-regulatory TAATGARAT (R = purine) target elements that are present in one or more copies in the upstream regions of responsive genes. VP16, however, has only weak intrinsic DNA binding activity and efficient binding to target sites requires the assembly of VP16 into a multicomponent complex along with at least two cellular factors, the ubiquitously expressed POU homeodomain protein Oct-1, and an additional cellular factor variously called VCAF-1, HCF, C1, or CCF ((4Gerster T.

The prior binding of Oct-1 to TAATGARAT elements is a prerequisite to the formation of VIC; however, the efficient incorporation of VP16 into the complex requires the auxiliary component VCAF-1, a large cellular factor which can interact directly with VP16 in the absence of Oct-1 and DNA(5Katan M.

There is no evidence for the formation of Oct-1-VP16 or Oct-1-VCAF-1-VP16 heteromeric complexes in the absence of DNA; however, it has been demonstrated that VP16 is able to bind directly to DNA or to generate a complex with DNA-bound Oct-1 in the absence of VCAF-1 when high concentrations of VP16 are used in binding assays(17Kristie T.M.

The carboxyl-terminal acidic activation domain is essential for transcriptional activation but not for complex assembly. The residual 400 amino-terminal amino acids are necessary and sufficient for VIC formation as well as for interaction with VCAF-1 and binding to DNA (14Xiao P. Capone J.P. Mol. Cell.

Both subregions are involved in VIC formation, binding to VCAF-1, interaction with DNA-bound Oct-1, and contribute to the weak DNA binding activity associated with VP16(19Stern S. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2555-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Greaves R. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1642-1650Crossref Google Scholar, 27Werstuck G. Capone J.P. J.

J. Virol. 1993; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wu T.-J. Monokian G. Mark D.F. Wobbe C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3484-3493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite a large number of mutational studies, it is not known whether the individual interactions attributed to VP16 are essential for the assembly of transcriptionally active complexes. For instance, while VCAF-1 is essential for VIC formation, it is not known whether the intrinsic ability of VP16 to bind independently to VCAF-1 is a prerequisite for multicomponent complex assembly. Also, the weak DNA binding activity associated with VP16, or VCAF-1-independent interaction with DNA-bound Oct-1, is only observed when very high concentrations of VP16 are used in binding assays(17Kristie T.M. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 19Stern S. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2555-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); thus, the physiological significance of these interactions is not clear. Most mutational studies of VP16 have been carried out using large deletions or linker insertions and these might be expected to cause conformational changes in VP16 that could have secondary effects on complex assembly and protein-protein interactions. The only point mutational analysis so far described assessed the overall effects of specific point mutants on VIC formation and transactivation(25Greaves R. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to determine if individual protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions involving VP16 can be uncoupled from VP16-induced complex formation and transactivation, we converted selected charged residues in regions 1 and 2 into alanine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant proteins were analyzed in vitro for protein-DNA complex formation with Oct-1 and interaction with VCAF-1 and in vivo for transactivation of a VP16-responsive reporter gene. Among the mutants generated were those that were defective in direct VCAF-1 interaction and DNA binding but were still capable of generating the VIC complex and directing transcriptional activation in vivo. Our findings indicate that the assembly of functional VP16-containing multicomponent complexes does not necessarily require the prior interaction of VP16 with VCAF-1 or the capability of VP16 to bind directly to DNA or associate with DNA-bound Oct-1, suggesting that the cooperative assembly of VP16-dependent complexes can occur by different pathways. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the Kunkle method (34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1990Google Scholar) using a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Single-stranded M13mp19 containing the antisense strand of the VP16 open reading frame was used as the template for mutagenesis. The following mutagenic oligonucleotides, designed to convert the indicated wild type amino acids into alanine residues, were used.

The notation refers to the type and position of the wild type amino acid (single letter code) targeted for alteration to an alanine residue. Purified phage DNA containing the desired mutations were screened by DNA sequence analysis and the replicative form DNA was prepared(34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1990Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing the various mutant derivatives of VP16 as fusion proteins to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) were constructed by subcloning the SalI fragment (corresponding to amino acids 4-411 of VP16) from the respective M13 replicative form plasmids into the SalI site of pMal-C (New England Biolabs). The MBP expression plasmid MBP-VP16, containing the wild type VP16 SalI fragment, has been described(31Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified from induced cultures of Escherichia coli DH5α by affinity chromatography on amylose resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Bound protein was eluted with column buffer (CB; 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) supplemented with 10 mM maltose. Peak fractions were pooled and exchanged into buffer D (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20%, v/v, glycerol) using PD10 gel filtration columns (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Fusion proteins were judged to be 60-70% pure by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. GST-Oct-1 (Oct-1 POU homeodomain fused to glutathione S-transferase) and PA-VP16 (amino acids 4-411 of VP16 fused to Staphylococcus aureus protein A) were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose and IgG-Sepharose, respectively, as described previously(27Werstuck G. Capone J.P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5509-5513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). VCAF-1 was purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by affinity chromatography on columns containing covalently coupled PA-VP16 fusion protein and suspended in buffer D as described previously(14Xiao P. Capone J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4974-4977Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 30Smibert C.A. Popova B. Xiao P. Capone J.P. Smiley J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2239-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA mobility shift assays were carried out as before(31Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, standard 20-μl reactions contained 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EDTA, 25 mM KCl, 4 μg of nonspecific competitor DNA (a 1:2 mixture of salmon sperm DNA:poly(dI-dC)) and combinations of 0.05 μg of purified GST-Oct-1, 2-4 μl of affinity-purified VCAF-1, and various amounts of MBP-VP16 fusion proteins as described in the figure legends. Protein concentration in each reaction was normalized to 20 μg with BSA. Reactions were preincubated for 5 min prior to the addition of 32P-end-labeled probe DNA corresponding to the promoter proximal TAATGARAT element from the HSV-1 ICP0 gene, 5′ GATCCCGTGCATGCTAATGATATTCTTT. Reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30°C and resolved on 3.5% polyacrylamide gels run at 4°C in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA(34Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1990Google Scholar). VCAF-1 binding assays were carried out essentially as described using purified MBP or MBP-VP16 fusion proteins adsorbed onto amylose resin(31Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of settled beads coupled with the various fusion proteins (2.5 mg of protein/ml of settled beads) were incubated for 2 h at 4°C with an equal volume of affinity-purified VCAF-1 with constant rotation. After low speed centrifugation, the supernatant containing the nonbound material was collected, and the beads were washed three times with 10 volumes of buffer D containing 100 μg/ml BSA and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by three washes with buffer D alone. Bound material was eluted from the settled beads with 20 μl of buffer D containing 0.6 M KCl. Equivalent volumes of bound and nonbound material (6 μl) were assayed for VCAF-1 activity by mobility shift analysis with GST-Oct-1 and wild type MBP-VP16. Buffer components and protein concentration in the binding assays were normalized as appropriate. Full-length [35S]methionine-labeled HSV-1 vhs protein was prepared by transcription and translation of the in vitro expression plasmid pSPUTKvhs using rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega) as described previously(30Smibert C.A. Popova B. Xiao P. Capone J.P. Smiley J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2239-2246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For binding assays, amylose beads adsorbed with equivalent amounts of MBP or the various MBP-VP16 fusion proteins were washed sequentially with 10 volumes of CB, CB + 0.2% BSA, and CB + 0.2% BSA + 0.05% Nonidet P-40. 50 μl of settled beads were recovered by low speed centrifugation and incubated with radiolabeled Vhs protein (200 μl of a 1:100 dilution of programmed reticulocyte lysate). The beads were incubated for 1 h at 4°C with continuous rotation and recovered by centrifugation. Beads were washed once with 10 volumes of CB, three times with 10 volumes of CB + 0.2% BSA, and 3 times with 10 volumes of CB + 0.2% BSA + 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Bound material was eluted by boiling with an equal volume of twice concentrated sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mammalian expression vector pEVRF65 contains the full-length VP16 open reading frame under transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus IE promoter. Expression vectors containing the various VP16 point mutants were constructed by replacing the wild type SalI fragment in pEVRF65 with the corresponding mutant fragments. Transfections were carried out in duplicate using 6-cm dishes of subconfluent Vero cells by the CaPO4 procedure as described previously(28Werstuck G. Capone J.P. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 75: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transfections contained 5 μg of the p175cat reporter gene (contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene under the transcriptional control of the promoter/regulatory region from HSV-1 ICP4 gene) along with 0.2-2.5 μg of the VP16 effector plasmids as indicated in the figure legend. Promoter dosage was normalized with appropriate amounts of empty vector and total DNA was kept constant (20 μg of DNA/dish) with sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h post-transfection, and CAT activity was measured using the liquid scintillation method as described(35Eastman A. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 730-732Google Scholar). Results were normalized to the value obtained with the reporter plasmid co-transfected with the empty expression vector and represent the average from at least three independent transfections carried out in duplicate. Previous studies have shown that amino acids 140-250 and 335-390 of VP16 contain determinants that are important for VIC formation and VCAF-1 interaction(19Stern S. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2555-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Greaves R. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1642-1650Crossref Google Scholar, 25Greaves R. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2716-2724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Werstuck G. Capone J.P. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5509-5513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Popova B. Bilan P. Xiao P. Faught M. Capone J.P. Virology. 1995; 209: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Both regions 1 and 2 are enriched in positively charged residues, in particular arginine residues, relative to the whole protein. Since positively charged amino acids are important in both protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, we decided to alter selected arginine residues to alanine residues by site-directed mutagenesis. Alanine residues were chosen, since these would not be expected to alter the conformation of the polypeptide backbone(36Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2339) Google Scholar). The introduced mutations are shown in Fig. 1A. These include alanine substitutions of arginines at positions 155, 162, 164, 169, 360, 366, and 368. Cys-176 was also mutated to examine the role of this sulfhydryl group. Also, Lys-379 was mutated, since the region surrounding this amino acid has been shown to be surface exposed and to be involved in protein-DNA complex formation(32Hayes S. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 852-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VP16 and the various mutant derivatives were cloned into an MBP expression vector, and the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on amylose resin (Fig. 1B; all MBP-VP16 derivatives encoded residues 4-411 and are thus missing the acidic activation domain). The purified proteins were used to monitor the following properties of VP16: direct DNA binding to the TAATGARAT elements, interaction with DNA-bound Oct-1, direct interaction with VCAF-1, VIC formation, and association with Vhs. Kristie and Sharp (17Kristie T.M. Sharp P.A. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 2383-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) first showed that if sufficiently large amounts of VP16 are used in DNA binding assays, VP16 can bind independently and sequence specifically to TAATGARAT elements. Fig. 2A shows the results of DNA binding assays with VP16 carried out in the absence of Oct-1 and VCAF-1 using the labeled ICP0 octa+ TAATGARAT element. A 10-20-fold excess of VP16, compared with the amount sufficient to form VIC in the presence of Oct-1 and VCAF-1 (see below), was used in this case in order to observe direct DNA binding. As can be seen, MBP-VP16 (referred to as wild type protein unless noted otherwise), forms a distinct protein DNA complex with the probe (lane b). This interaction is sequence-specific, since it was not observed with mutant oligonucleotides that contained alterations in the GARAT portion (17, 37; data not presented). By way of comparison, a protein A-VP16 fusion protein (PA-VP16), which is larger than MBP-VP16, generates a slower migrating complex as expected (lane a). Mutant derivatives R155A, R164A, R169A, C176A, R368A, and K370A bound to DNA with efficiencies comparable with MBP-VP16 (compare lanes b with lanes c, e, f, g, j, and k, respectively). In contrast, R162A, R366A, and R368A were unable to bind to the probe (lanes d, h, and i, respectively), even when 3-fold higher concentrations of protein were used in the assays (not presented). Oct-1 does not interact with VP16 in solution; however, under appropriate conditions, VP16 can interact weakly with DNA-bound Oct-1 in the absence of VCAF-1 (19Stern S. Herr W. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2555-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Walker S. Hayes S. O'Hare P. Cell. 1994; 79: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In order to examine the effect of the introduced mutations on this interaction, mobility shift assays were carried out in the presence of purified GST-Oct-1 and the various VP16 derivatives. As shown in Fig. 2B, incubation of MBP-VP16 with GST-Oct-1 results in the formation of a weak Oct-1-MBP-VP16 complex that migrates slightly faster than the complex formed with MBP-VP16, which is also generated under these conditions with comparable efficiency (lane b). The reason this complex migrates slightly faster than the VP16-DNA complex is not clear; however, it may be due to conformation of the ternary complex that results in faster electrophoretic mobility compared with the VP16-DNA complex alone. A complex with similar mobility to wild type MBP-VP16-Oct-1 was observed with all the region 1 mutants (R155A, R162A, R164A, R169A, C176A; lanes c-g) but not with any of the region 2 mutants (R360A, R366A, R368A, K370A; lanes h-k). The findings that R368A and K320A were still able to bind independently to DNA but did not form the Oct-1/VP16 complex, whereas R162A was unable to bind to DNA (Fig. 2A, lane d) but could generate the Oct-1/VP16 complex (Fig. 2B, lane d), indicates that interaction of VP16 with DNA-bound Oct-1 does not require its intrinsic DNA binding activity. Assembly of the full multicomponent VIC complex requires the presence of VCAF-1 in addition to Oct-1 and VP16 (Fig. 3, compare lanes 2, 3, and 6, respectively). All of the mutant VP16 derivatives were capable of directing the formation of VIC when reactions were supplemented with VCAF-1 and Oct-1, although there was some variation in the amount of VIC formed with different mutants. Under the experimental conditions used in this experiment, an excess of VP16 was used in order to visualize both its independent DNA binding and interaction with Oct-1 in the same experiment (under standard conditions, only the VIC complex is observed; see Fig. 4). The findings indicate that neither the intrinsic DNA binding activity of VP16 nor its ability to directly associate with DNA-bound Oct-1 is required for higher order complex assembly directed by VCAF-1.Figure 4:Interaction of VP16 mutant derivatives with VCAF-1. VCAF-1 was incubated with MBP or the different MBP-VP16 fusion proteins immobilized on amylose resin as indicated in the figure. Equivalent amounts of nonbound (A) and bound (B) fractions recovered from the supernatant and beads, respectively, were assayed for VCAF-1 activity in the presence of 0.05 μg of GST-Oct-1 and 0.5 μg"
