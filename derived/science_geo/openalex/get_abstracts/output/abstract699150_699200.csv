https://openalex.org/W4289528079,"In vitro cultured stem cells with distinct developmental capacities can contribute to embryonic or extraembryonic tissues after microinjection into pre-implantation mammalian embryos. However, whether cultured stem cells can independently give rise to entire gastrulating embryo-like structures with embryonic and extraembryonic compartments remains unknown. Here, we adapt a recently established platform for prolonged ex utero growth of natural embryos to generate mouse post-gastrulation synthetic whole embryo models (sEmbryos), with both embryonic and extraembryonic compartments, starting solely from naive ESCs. This was achieved by co-aggregating non-transduced ESCs, with naive ESCs transiently expressing Cdx2 or Gata4 to promote their priming toward trophectoderm and primitive endoderm lineages, respectively. sEmbryos adequately accomplish gastrulation, advance through key developmental milestones, and develop organ progenitors within complex extraembryonic compartments similar to E8.5 stage mouse embryos. Our findings highlight the plastic potential of naive pluripotent cells to self-organize and functionally reconstitute and model the entire mammalian embryo beyond gastrulation."

However, details about the mechanism of exosome biogenesis are unclear. Here, we carried out a cargo-based analysis of exosome cargo protein biogenesis in which we identified the most highly enriched exosomal cargo proteins and then followed their biogenesis, trafficking, and exosomal secretion to test different hypotheses for how cells make exosomes. We show that exosome cargo proteins bud from cells (i) in exosome-sized vesicles regardless of whether they are localized to plasma or endosome membranes, (ii) ∼5-fold more efficiently when localized to the plasma membrane, (iii) ∼5-fold less efficiently when targeted to the endosome membrane, (iv) by a stochastic process that leads to ∼100-fold differences in their abundance from one exosome to another, and (v) independently of small GTPase Rab27a, the ESCRT complex–associated protein Alix, or the cargo protein CD63. Taken together, our results demonstrate that cells use a shared, stochastic mechanism to bud exosome cargoes along the spectrum of plasma and endosome membranes and far more efficiently from the plasma membrane than the endosome. Our observations also indicate that the pronounced variation in content between different exosome-sized vesicles is an inevitable consequence of a stochastic mechanism of small vesicle biogenesis, that the origin membrane of exosome-sized extracellular vesicles simply cannot be determined, and that most of what we currently know about exosomes has likely come from studies of plasma membrane-derived vesicles.

Exosomes are secreted, single membrane–bound vesicles that have the same topology as the cell and a diameter of ∼30 to 150 nm (1Pegtel D.M. Gould S.J. Exosomes.Annu. Rev.

Immunol. 2002; 2: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Exosomes are enriched in specific subsets of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, whereas the larger microvesicles (>0.2 nm diameter) show little evidence for macromolecular enrichment (1Pegtel D.M.

Together, exosomes and microvesicles represent the two major classes of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that are released by normal, uninfected cells, as most other types of EVs are released by damaged, dying, dead, and/or infected cells (e.g., microsomes generated by physical tears in the plasma membrane (PM), apoptotic blebs, oncosomes, enveloped viruses, virus-like particles, etc.) (1Pegtel D.M. Gould S.J. Exosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88: 487-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). It should be noted that some investigators use the term ‘exosome’ only for vesicles shown definitively to have arisen from endosomes (6Mathieu M. Nevo N. Jouve M. Valenzuela J.I. Maurin M.

On primacy, precision, and popularity influencing a choice of nomenclature.J. Extracell. Vesicles. 2019; 81648167Crossref Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, we do not see the logic of such a definition (1Pegtel D.M. Gould S.J. Exosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88: 487-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), in part because there is no way to ever know where any individual exosome arose once it has left the cell, and in part because the data of this paper show there is no substantive difference between small EVs that bud from plasma or endosome membranes. Exosomes are made by all cells and are present in all biofluids, including blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, amniotic fluid, milk, sweat, bile, vitreous, synovial fluid, bronchial lavage fluid, pleural effusions, and ascites (8Zhou B.

Given their broad biomedical relevance, elucidating the molecular mechanisms of exosome biogenesis is likely to have significant impacts on human health and disease. In light of the broad biomedical importance of exosomes, it is unfortunate that we still do not know how cells (i) recognize exosome cargoes, (ii) direct them to and into nascent, budding vesicles, and (iii) release the resulting exosome-sized vesicles into the extracellular milieu. Our dearth of understanding in these areas reflects a complex biology that simply does not conform to the core principles that characterize other organelle biogenesis pathways. For example, exosomal cargo proteins do not share a common peptide motif that targets them into exosomes (1Pegtel D.M. Gould S.J. Exosomes.Annu. Rev.

This study constructs the coupling coordination mechanism and the aggregated evaluation index system to measure the mutual coordination relations between them, assesses the performances and the coupling coordination degrees between them in the case of western provincial regions in China, and proposes countermeasures based on the prediction results. It is found that the performances of higher education are relatively more stable than those of environmental governance, and the distributions of the average performance grades exist noticeable geographical differences. Besides, the coupling coordination degrees increase with mild fluctuations with relatively small spatial variations, demonstrating the balanced and similar coordinated development status among regions; furthermore, in the future, the gaps in the coordination status among regions will gradually decline. This study highlights the mutual coordination mechanism between the two subsystems, compares the coupling coordination status among regions both temporally and spatially, and proposes specific, generalizable development suggestions that contribute to the academic sector, policymakers, ecology, and sustainability."

The cell division cycle protein 20 homolog (Cdc20) is a positive regulator of cell division, but how its dysregulation may relate to senescence is unclear. Here, we find that Cdc20 mRNA and protein expression are downregulated in stress-induced premature senescent lung fibroblasts in a p53-dependent manner. Either Cdc20 downregulation or inhibition of anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is sufficient to induce premature senescence in lung fibroblasts, while APC/C activation inhibits stress-induced premature senescence. Mechanistically, we show both Cdc20 downregulation and APC/C inhibition induce premature senescence through glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β–mediated phosphorylation and downregulation of securin expression. Interestingly, we determined Cdc20 expression is upregulated in human lung adenocarcinoma. We find that downregulation of Cdc20 in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells is sufficient to inhibit cell proliferation and growth in soft agar and to promote apoptosis, but not senescence, in a manner dependent on downregulation of securin following GSK-3β-mediated securin phosphorylation. Similarly, we demonstrate securin expression is downregulated and cell viability is inhibited in NSCLC cells following inhibition of APC/C. Furthermore, we show chemotherapeutic drugs downregulate both Cdc20 and securin protein expression in NSCLC cells. Either Cdc20 downregulation by siRNA or APC/C inhibition sensitize, while securin overexpression inhibits, chemotherapeutic drug-induced NSCLC cell death. Together, our findings provide evidence that Cdc20/APC/C/securin-dependent signaling is a key regulator of cell survival, and its disruption promotes premature senescence in normal lung cells and induces apoptosis in lung cancer cells that have bypassed the senescence barrier.

Cellular senescence can be divided into two main categories: replicative senescence and stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS). Replicative senescence is dependent on the number of divisions the cell has completed.

Senescent cells have antagonistic pleiotropic roles in cancer. Since senescent cells are unable to proliferate, cellular senescence is a powerful tumor suppressor mechanism. Consistent with an anti-tumorigenic role of senescence, senescent cells accumulate at sites of premalignant lesions in mice and humans and are absent or rare in malignant tumors (8Serrano M. Lin A.W.

However, accumulation of senescent cells during aging can promote cancer cell growth given their ability to release factors that stimulate cell proliferation. The signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that regulate the acquisition of a senescent phenotype are therefore of upmost importance in cancer biology. Cdc20 is a key positive regulator of cell division. Proper chromosome attachment to the mitotic spindle is guaranteed by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which prevents anaphase onset (31Kapanidou M. Curtis N.L. Bolanos-Garcia V.M. Cdc20: at the crossroads between chromosome segregation and mitotic exit.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2017; 42: 193-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The SAC inhibits Cdc20. Once proper chromosome alignment has been achieved (32Lawrence K.S. Chau T. Engebrecht J.

APC/C is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that triggers anaphase and mitotic exit by promoting the degradation of securin and cyclin B1 (35Delgado-Esteban M. Garcia-Higuera I. Maestre C. Moreno S. Almeida A.

Cell Biol. 2015; 16: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Degradation of securin releases the protease separase, which promotes degradation of the cohesion complex allowing sister chromatids to move to opposite spindle poles. Degradation of cyclin B1 inactivates mitotic cyclic–dependent kinase (Cdk1) complexes, which promotes the exit from mitosis. Impaired Cdc20-APC/C function delays mitotic exit and induces a chronic DDR signaling. Whether dysregulation of Cdc20 and APC/C is functionally linked to the development of senescence is largely unknown. Evidence indicates that Cdc20 plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Overexpression of Cdc20 has been observed in a variety of human tumors, including lung, gastric, and breast cancer, where its activity has been associated with tumor initiation, maintenance, and growth (39Gayyed M.F.

Tumor cells need to escape apoptosis in order to generate a relevant tumor mass. Most chemotherapeutic drugs inhibit cancer growth by promoting apoptosis of cancer cells. Although chemotherapeutic drugs are effective means in cancer therapy, their use can be limited by undesirable toxicity. Moreover, defective apoptotic programs may contribute to treatment failure. Thus, studies are warrant to better understand the molecular mechanisms through which chemotherapeutic drugs induce apoptotic cell death of cancer cells in order to develop improved therapeutic options for cancer patients. In the present study, we find that loss of Cdc20-APC/C–mediated signaling has different functional outcomes in normal and cancer cells. We provide evidence that either loss of Cdc20 expression or inhibition of APC/C activity promotes senescence in normal human lung fibroblasts while it causes apoptosis in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through a mechanism that requires loss of securin expression. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the signaling mechanisms that control the development of senescence and apoptosis, two cellular events that are relevant to the fields of aging, age-related disease, and cancer. To begin investigating the role of Cdc20 in cellular senescence, we determined how Cdc20 protein expression changed in cells that were induced to premature senesce by external stressors. To this end, we exposed WI-38 human diploid lung fibroblasts to oxidative stress by treating the cells to sublethal levels of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). We find that sublethal oxidative stress induced senescence in WI-38 cells, as shown by immunoblotting analysis using antibodies specific for the senescence markers phospho-p53 and γ-H2A.X (Fig. 1A) and by quantification of cells that are positive for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity (Fig. 1, B and C) and senescence-associated cell morphology (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, while Cdc20 protein expression was detectible in growing WI-38 cells, Cdc20 protein expression was reduced to almost undetectable levels in senescent WI-38 cells (Fig. 1A). Consistent with these data, we find that treatment with either UV-C light or cigarette smoke extracts (CSEs) also induced premature senescence (Fig. S1A-D and S2A-D, respectively) and drastically reduced Cdc20 protein expression in WI-38 cells, as compared with nonsenescent control cells (Figs. S1A and S2A). Thus, Cdc20 is downregulated in premature senescent fibroblasts. To determine whether the severe downregulation of Cdc20 protein expression observed in premature senescent WI-38 fibroblasts occurred at the transcriptional or translational level, we assessed Cdc20 mRNA expression by RT-PCR in WI-38 cells before and after induction of premature senescence with oxidative stress, UV-C light, and CSEs. We find that, similarly to Cdc20 protein expression, these senescence-inducing stimuli blunted Cdc20 mRNA expression to virtually undetectable levels (Fig. 2, A–C). In addition, we find that treatment with the proteosomal inhibitors MG-132, chloroquine, or ammonium chloride did not prevent Cdc20 protein downregulation induced by oxidative stress in senescent WI-38 fibroblasts (Fig. S3A). These results indicate that downregulation of Cdc20 in premature senescent human diploid fibroblasts occurs through a mechanism that inhibits Cdc20 gene transcription. Importantly, downregulation of Cdc20 was not limited to premature senescent cells but occurred also during replicative senescence. In fact, similarly to stress-induced premature senescent WI-38 cells, Cdc20 protein (Fig. 2D) and mRNA (Fig. 2E) expression was dramatically reduced in replicative senescent WI-38 fibroblasts, as compared to their nonsenescent counterparts. The transcription factor p53 can induce cellular senescence. Interestingly, p53 has been shown to negatively regulate Cdc20 expression in human cells (50Banerjee T. Nath S. Roychoudhury S. DNA damage induced p53 downregulates Cdc20 by direct binding to its promoter causing chromatin remodeling.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2688-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 51Kidokoro T. Tanikawa C. Furukawa Y. Katagiri T. Nakamura Y. Matsuda K. CDC20, a potential cancer therapeutic target, is negatively regulated by p53.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1562-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether p53 plays a role in the downregulation of Cdc20 expression that we observed in senescent cells. To directly answer this question, we induced premature senescence in p53 WT and p53 KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by exposing the cells to sublethal oxidative stress. We find that oxidative stress induced premature senescence in p53 WT but not p53 KO MEFs (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, sublethal oxidative stress downregulated both Cdc20 mRNA (Fig. 3C) and protein (Fig. 3D) expression in WT MEFs but not p53 KO MEFs. We conclude that p53 transcriptionally downregulates Cdc20 expression in senescent fibroblasts. To determine whether the downregulation of Cdc20 expression that we described in senescent human fibroblasts is correlative or causal in nature, we downregulated Cdc20 expression by siRNA in WI-38 fibroblasts that were not subjected to any extracellular stress (Fig. 4A). We show that downregulation of Cdc20 protein expression induced the upregulation of markers of cellular senescence such as p16, p21, phospho-p53, and γ-H2A.X after 10 days (Fig. 4A). We also find that most Cdc20 siRNA-expressing cells became positive for SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 4, B and C) and displayed senescence-associated (SA) cell morphology (Fig. 4D). Moreover, downregulation of Cdc20 by siRNA significantly inhibited cell proliferation, as shown by cell count analysis (Fig. S3B) and BrdU incorporation assays (Fig. S3C). Downregulation of Cdc20 expression for less than 10 days did not induce a maximal senescence response (not shown). Thus, downregulation of Cdc20 expression in human fibroblasts is causally linked to the development of premature senescence. Cdc20 is an activator of APC/C. To independently confirm the causal relationship between loss of Cdc20 expression and development of a senescent phenotype, we tested the functional consequence of inhibiting APC/C by treating WI-38 cells with Apcin and pro-TAME, known specific inhibitors of APC/C. We find that inhibition of APC/C by Apcin plus TAME was sufficient to induce premature senescence in WI-38 fibroblasts, as shown by the upregulation of p16, p21, phospho-p53, and γ-H2A.X (Fig. 5A), the expression of SA-β-gal activity (Fig. 5, B and C), and the acquisition of SA cell morphology (Fig. S4A). Mps1 kinase is critical for APC/C inhibition and inhibition of Mps1 activates APC/C. In support of our data, treatment of WI-38 cells with the selective Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 inhibited premature senescence induced by oxidative stress in WI-38 cells (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, since oxidative stress downregulated Cdc20 expression, our result of Fig. 5D suggests that APC/C can be activated by Mps1 inhibition even in the absence of Cdc20 and that such activation is sufficient to partially rescue SIPS. In support of this conclusion, data show that APC/C has basal activity even in the absence of Cdc20, that is, APC/C can bind substrates at low affinity in the absence of Cdc20 (52Eytan E. Moshe Y. Braunstein I. Hershko A. Roles of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome and of its activator Cdc20 in functional substrate binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U S A. 2006; 103: 2081-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Alternatively, one can speculate that APC/C is activated in a Cdc20-independent manner following inhibition of Mps1 by AZ3146 or that inhibition of Mps1 promotes SIPS in an APC/C-independent manner. The Cullin subunit Apc2 is part of the catalytic core of APC/C. To determine whether oxidative stress also changed APC/C expression, we quantified the expression levels of Apc2 in WI-38 cells treated with sublethal H2O2. We find that H2O2 treatment induced a partial loss of Apc2 expression in WI-38 cells and only after 10 days (Fig. S4B), suggesting that oxidative stress inhibits the APC/C complex mostly by inducing the downregulation of the APC/C activator Cdc20. Together, our findings indicate that downregulation of Cdc20 protein expression is causally linked to the development of a premature senescent phenotype through inactivation of APC/C. Activation of APC/C promotes the degradation of securin and triggers anaphase and mitotic exit (35Delgado-Esteban M. Garcia-Higuera I. Maestre C. Moreno S. Almeida A.

https://openalex.org/W4292636025,"Carcasses of common pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) killed by hunters using shotguns are widely used or sold in the United Kingdom and elsewhere for human consumption. Almost all of the birds are shot using shotgun pellets composed principally of lead (Pb). Lead shotgun pellets often fragment on impact within the bodies of gamebirds, leaving small lead particles in the meat that are difficult for consumers to detect and remove and from which a greater proportion of lead is likely to be absorbed. Chronic exposure to even low levels of lead is associated with negative health effects in humans and especially in groups particularly vulnerable to the effects of lead, which include young children and pregnant women. Our study used a high-resolution computerised tomography X-ray scanner to locate, in three dimensions, metal fragments embedded within carcasses of eight pheasants sold for human consumption in the UK. Small radio-dense fragments (<2 mm diameter), assumed to be metallic lead, were present in all of the pheasant carcasses examined (mean number: 39 per carcass) and many were too small (<0.1 mm diameter) and too distant from the nearest large shotgun pellet for it to be practical for consumers to detect and remove them without discarding a large proportion of otherwise usable meat. Consumers of carcasses of pheasants killed using lead shotgun ammunition are likely to be exposed to elevated levels of dietary lead, even if careful food preparation is practiced to remove shotgun pellets and the most damaged tissue."

This study recruited non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients from a general population to study prevalence of late cognitive impairment and associations with initial symptoms. We invited patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19. A postal questionnaire addressed basic demographics, initial COVID-19 symptoms and co-morbidity about 4 months after diagnosis. About 7 months later, we conducted cognitive tests using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery, comprising four tests for short-term memory, attention and executive function. We present descriptive statistics using z-scores relative to UK population norms and defined impairment as z-score <-1.5. We used multivariable logistic regression with impairment as outcome. Continuous domain scores were analysed by multiple linear regression. Of the initial 458 participants; 305 were invited, and 234 (77%) completed cognitive testing. At median 11 (range 8-13) months after PCR positivity, cognitive scores for short term memory, visuospatial processing, learning and attention were lower than norms (p≤0.001). In each domain, 4-14% were cognitively impaired; 68/232 (29%) were impaired in ≥ 1 of 4 tests. There was no association between initial symptom severity and impairment. Multivariable linear regression showed association between spatial working memory and initial symptom load (6-9 symptoms vs. 0-5, coef. 4.26, 95% CI: 0.65; 7.86). No other dimension scores were associated with symptom load. At median 11 months after out-of-hospital SARS-Cov-2 infection, minor cognitive impairment was seen with little association between COVID-19 symptom severity and outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4292636384,"Substantial genetic correlations have been reported across psychiatric disorders and numerous cross-disorder genetic variants have been detected. To identify the genetic variants underlying general psychopathology in childhood, we performed a genome-wide association study using a total psychiatric problem score. We analyzed 6,844,199 common SNPs in 38,418 school-aged children from 20 population-based cohorts participating in the EAGLE consortium. The SNP heritability of total psychiatric problems was 5.4% (SE = 0.01) and two loci reached genome-wide significance: rs10767094 and rs202005905. We also observed an association of SBF2, a gene associated with neuroticism in previous GWAS, with total psychiatric problems. The genetic effects underlying the total score were shared with common psychiatric disorders only (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, insomnia) (rG > 0.49), but not with autism or the less common adult disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or eating disorders) (rG < 0.01). Importantly, the total psychiatric problem score also showed at least a moderate genetic correlation with intelligence, educational attainment, wellbeing, smoking, and body fat (rG > 0.29). The results suggest that many common genetic variants are associated with childhood psychiatric symptoms and related phenotypes in general instead of with specific symptoms. Further research is needed to establish causality and pleiotropic mechanisms between related traits."
https://openalex.org/W4292239248,"Endothelial cells (ECs) are the primary cellular constituent of blood vessels that are in direct contact with hemodynamic forces over their lifetime. Throughout the body, vessels experience different blood flow patterns and rates that alter vascular architecture and cellular behavior. Because of the complexities of studying blood flow in an intact organism, particularly during development, the field has increasingly relied on in vitro modeling of blood flow as a powerful technique for studying hemodynamic-dependent signaling mechanisms in ECs. While commercial flow systems that recirculate fluids exist, many commercially available pumps are peristaltic and best model pulsatile flow conditions. However, there are many important situations in which ECs experience laminar flow conditions in vivo, such as along long straight stretches of the vasculature. To understand EC function under these contexts, it is important to be able to reproducibly model laminar flow conditions in vitro. Here, we outline a method to reliably adapt commercially available peristaltic pumps to study laminar flow conditions. Our proof-of-concept study focuses on 2D models but could be further adapted to 3D environments to better model in vivo scenarios, such as organ development. Our studies make significant inroads into solving technical challenges associated with flow modeling and allow us to conduct functional studies toward understanding the mechanistic role of shear forces on vascular architecture, cellular behavior, and remodeling in diverse physiological contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4292240262,"Hepatic steatosis associated with high-fat diet, obesity, and type 2 diabetes is thought to be the major driver of severe liver inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Cytosolic acetyl CoA (AcCoA), a central metabolite and substrate for de novo lipogenesis (DNL), is produced from citrate by ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) and from acetate through AcCoA synthase short chain family member 2 (ACSS2). However, the relative contributions of these two enzymes to hepatic AcCoA pools and DNL rates in response to high-fat feeding are unknown. We report here that hepatocyte-selective depletion of either ACSS2 or ACLY caused similar 50% decreases in liver AcCoA levels in obese mice, showing that both pathways contribute to the generation of this DNL substrate. Unexpectedly however, the hepatocyte ACLY depletion in obese mice paradoxically increased total DNL flux measured by D2O incorporation into palmitate, whereas in contrast, ACSS2 depletion had no effect. The increase in liver DNL upon ACLY depletion was associated with increased expression of nuclear sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and of its target DNL enzymes. This upregulated DNL enzyme expression explains the increased rate of palmitate synthesis in ACLY-depleted livers. Furthermore, this increased flux through DNL may also contribute to the observed depletion of AcCoA levels because of its increased conversion to malonyl CoA and palmitate. Together, these data indicate that in fat diet-fed obese mice, hepatic DNL is not limited by its immediate substrates AcCoA or malonyl CoA but rather by activities of DNL enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W4292240717,"Amyloid protein aggregation is commonly associated with progressive neurodegenerative diseases, however not all amyloid fibrils are pathogenic. The neuronal cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein is a regulator of synaptic mRNA translation and has been shown to form functional amyloid aggregates that stabilize long-term memory. In adult Drosophila neurons, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding homolog Orb2 is expressed as 2 isoforms, of which the Orb2B isoform is far more abundant, but the rarer Orb2A isoform is required to initiate Orb2 aggregation. The N terminus is a distinctive feature of the Orb2A isoform and is critical for its aggregation. Intriguingly, replacement of phenylalanine in the fifth position of Orb2A with tyrosine (F5Y) in Drosophila impairs stabilization of long-term memory. The structure of endogenous Orb2B fibers was recently determined by cryo-EM, but the structure adopted by fibrillar Orb2A is less certain. Here we use micro-electron diffraction to determine the structure of the first 9 N-terminal residues of Orb2A, at a resolution of 1.05 Å. We find that this segment (which we term M9I) forms an amyloid-like array of parallel in-register β-sheets, which interact through side chain interdigitation of aromatic and hydrophobic residues. Our structure provides an explanation for the decreased aggregation observed for the F5Y mutant and offers a hypothesis for how the addition of a single atom (the tyrosyl oxygen) affects long-term memory. We also propose a structural model of Orb2A that integrates our structure of the M9I segment with the published Orb2B cryo-EM structure."
https://openalex.org/W4292636103,"Introduction Currently, sub-second monitoring of neurotransmitter release in humans can only be performed during standard of care invasive procedures like DBS electrode implantation. The procedure requires acute insertion of a research probe and additional time in surgery, which may increase infection risk. We sought to determine the impact of our research procedure, particularly the extended time in surgery, on infection risk. Methods We screened 602 patients who had one or more procedure codes documented for DBS electrode implantation, generator placement, programming, or revision for any reason performed at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center between January 2011 through October 2020 using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes for infection. During this period, 116 patients included an IRB approved 30-minute research protocol, during the Phase 1 DBS electrode implantation surgery, to monitor sub-second neurotransmitter release. We used Fisher’s Exact test (FET) to determine if there was a significant change in the infection rate following DBS electrode implantation procedures that included, versus those that did not include, the neurotransmitter monitoring research protocol. Results Within 30-days following DBS electrode implantation, infection was observed in 1 (0.21%) out of 486 patients that did not participate in the research procedure and 2 (1.72%) of the 116 patients that did participate in the research procedure. Notably, all types of infection observed were typical of those expected for DBS electrode implantation. Conclusion Infection rates are not statistically different across research and non-research groups within 30-days following the research procedure (1.72% vs. 0.21%; p = 0.0966, FET). Our results demonstrate that the research procedures used for sub-second monitoring of neurotransmitter release in humans can be performed without increasing the rate of infection."

https://openalex.org/W4292236943,"The NtrC family of proteins senses external stimuli and accordingly stimulates stress and virulence pathways via activation of associated σ54-dependent RNA polymerases. However, the structural determinants that mediate this activation are not well understood. Here, we establish using computational, structural, biochemical, and biophysical studies that MopR, an NtrC protein, harbors a dynamic bidirectional electrostatic network that connects the phenol pocket to two distal regions, namely the ""G-hinge"" and the ""allosteric linker."" While the G-hinge influences the entry of phenol into the pocket, the allosteric linker passes the signal to the downstream ATPase domain. We show that phenol binding induces a rewiring of the electrostatic connections by eliciting dynamic allostery and demonstrates that perturbation of the core relay residues results in a complete loss of ATPase stimulation. Furthermore, we found a mutation of the G-hinge, ∼20 Å from the phenol pocket, promotes altered flexibility by shifting the pattern of conformational states accessed, leading to a protein with 7-fold enhanced phenol binding ability and enhanced transcriptional activation. Finally, we conducted a global analysis that illustrates that dynamic allostery-driven conserved community networks are universal and evolutionarily conserved across species. Taken together, these results provide insights into the mechanisms of dynamic allostery-mediated conformational changes in NtrC sensor proteins."

The prospective cohort, the Oslo II-study from 2000, the second screening of the Oslo study of 1972/73, has been followed for 17 ½ years with regard to cancer incidence and mortality. A random sample of 697 elderly men comprised the study cohort. The antibody results measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used in the Cox proportional hazards analyses, and quartile risk on cancer incidence in a 17 ½ years follow-up. Among the 621 participants with no prior cancer diagnoses, 221 men developed cancer. The incidence trend was inverse, and the results are shown as 1st quartile of highest value and 4th as lowest of antibody levels. The results of the Cox proportional regression analyses showed that TF inversely predicts bladder cancer (n = 22) by Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.71 (95% CI: 1.12, 2.61). TD inversely predicts colon cancer (n = 26) by HR = 1.52 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.19) and bladder cancer (n = 22) by HR = 1.60 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.43). Antibodies to two oral bacteria, TF and TD, showed an inverse risk relationship with incidence of specific cancers: TF bladder cancer, TD bladder and colon cancer. Lowered immunological response to the oral infection, periodontitis, is shown to be a risk factor in terms of cancer aetiology."

A scientific understanding of their shrinkage and driving mechanism is conducive to the transformation and development of traditional industrial bases in China. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution and driving mechanism of regional shrinkage at the county scale in the three provinces. The main findings are as follows: (1) 40.86% of counties in the three provinces shrank, forming three concentrated shrinking regions. However, comprehensively shrinking regions were narrowed and lessened with the introduction of the Northeast Area Revitalization Plan. (2) The population-related shrinking regions accounted for more than 90% and continued to expand. Such shrinkage was higher in the north than in the south. The degree of economy-related shrinkage was the most serious, and the hotspots were mainly concentrated in Liaoning Province. The scope of space-related shrinkage was most minor, and such shrinkage was relatively mild. (3) When it came to influencing factors, the shrinkage index was positively correlated with the proportion of the secondary industry, the output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, the number of industrial enterprises above the designated size, fiscal expenditure, and the balance of resident deposits, and negatively correlated with the altitude, the proportion of the tertiary industry, and population aging. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) produced similar regression results. The spatial pattern of influencing factors was consistent with the hotspot areas of population-related shrinkage or economy-related shrinkage, with significant spatial differences."

However, none of these roles have been clearly linked to its function as a polyamine deacetylase. Polyamine homeostasis is dysregulated in nearly all cancer types, and targeting polyamine metabolism for cancer prevention and treatment has been a longstanding therapeutic strategy that has achieved some success (11Casero Jr., R.A.

Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is an irreversible inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, the first rate-limiting step in polyamine biosynthesis (Fig. 1). Approved for the treatment of African trypanosomiasis, DFMO has a proven safety record and is a promising chemopreventive agent (12Bassiri H. Benavides A. Haber M. Gilmour S.K.

However, compensatory mechanisms exist through which tumor cells respond to reduced intracellular polyamine biosynthesis by increasing import of polyamines from the extracellular environment. Extracellular polyamines, including those in the tumor microenvironment (TME), derive from sources including diet, metabolic products of the microbiota, and sloughed or damaged cells, particularly in the intestinal lumen (14Holbert C.E.

Cancer. 2022; 22: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). N8-AcSpd is rarely detected to accumulate intracellularly but has been detected in extracellular fluids in association with certain pathological states (15Saiki S. Sasazawa Y. Fujimaki M. Kamagata K.

Additionally, it is a metabolite of certain types of bacteria (19Yoshimoto S. Mitsuyama E. Yoshida K. Odamaki T. Xiao J.Z. Enriched metabolites that potentially promote age-associated diseases in subjects with an elderly-type gut microbiota.Gut Microbes. 2021; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although generally regarded as an excretory metabolite, we considered that N8-AcSpd, via HDAC10-mediated deacetylation to spermidine, may serve as a source of polyamines to proliferating cells with increased polyamine requirements, particularly in the context of polyamine-limiting anticancer therapies. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of HDAC10 in HCT116 cells was evidenced by Western blotting (Fig. S1) followed by Sanger sequencing to confirm biallelic generation of indels. HeLa cell clones lacking HDAC10 were previously reported (20Steimbach R.R. Herbst-Gervasoni C.J. Lechner S. Stewart T.M. Klinke G. Ridinger J. et al.Aza-SAHA derivatives are selective histone deacetylase 10 chemical probes that inhibit polyamine deacetylation and phenocopy HDAC10 knockout.ChemRxiv. 2022; (https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-37shs-v2)Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry analyses verified significantly increased levels of N8-AcSpd in both HDAC10-KO cell lines (Fig. 2). HCT116 cells had greater concentrations of this derivative in both WT and KO lines than did HeLa cells. Both cell lines also had significant increases in N1,N8-diacetylspermidine (diAcSpd), and the extent of this increase tended to correlate with reduction of N1-acetylspermidine (N1-AcSpd). No significant differences were detected in spermidine concentrations with HDAC10 knockout in either cell line. These results are consistent with those observed in a neuroblastoma cell line with HDAC10-targeting siRNA (20Steimbach R.R. Herbst-Gervasoni C.J. Lechner S. Stewart T.M. Klinke G. Ridinger J. et al.Aza-SAHA derivatives are selective histone deacetylase 10 chemical probes that inhibit polyamine deacetylation and phenocopy HDAC10 knockout.ChemRxiv. 2022; (https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-37shs-v2)Google Scholar) and confirm an association of N8-AcSpd with HDAC10 in cell lines derived from multiple tissues. Treatment of tumor cells with DFMO generally leads to a cytostatic response resulting from the depletion of intracellular polyamines. The import of extracellular polyamines can rescue this growth inhibition; however, whether N8-AcSpd maintains this ability was unknown. Cotreatment of HDAC10WT HCT116 cells with DFMO and N8-AcSpd, in the presence of aminoguanidine to inhibit extracellular amine oxidation (21Murray Stewart T. Dunston T.T. Woster P.M. Casero Jr., R.A. Polyamine catabolism and oxidative damage.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 18736-18745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), demonstrated that this metabolite could rescue growth, while no rescue occurred in HDAC10KO cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting a role for HDAC10 in allowing N8-AcSpd to re-enter the polyamine metabolic pathway in support of proliferation (Fig. 1). HDAC10 status had no effect on rescue by either N1-AcSpd or unmodified Spd, consistent with its high specificity for the N8 modification. These results are consistent with those obtained using HDAC10WT and HDAC10KO HeLa cells (Fig. 3B). Although providing monoacetylated spermidine rescued growth in WT cells regardless of which end of spermidine was modified, N1,N8-diAcSpd failed to support proliferation in the presence of DFMO (Fig. S2). Studies with recombinant HDAC10 also indicated deacetylase activity for N-acetylputrescine (N-AcPut) (1Hai Y. Shinsky S.A. Porter N.J. Christianson D.W. Histone deacetylase 10 structure and molecular function as a polyamine deacetylase.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15368Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, substituting N-AcPut for N8-AcSpd in our growth assays provided rescue regardless of the presence of HDAC10 (Fig. S2), consistent with alternative pathways for N-AcPut metabolism beyond HDAC10. As with Spd, unmodified putrescine (Put) also rescued DFMO-induced growth inhibition in both WT and KO cell lines. The growth rescue provided by N8-AcSpd in the presence of HDAC10 suggested its deacetylation into Spd, which can then enter the polyamine metabolic pathway to re-establish polyamine homeostasis (Fig. 1). We therefore analyzed intracellular polyamine concentrations following the combination treatments in HDAC10 WT and KO cell lines (Fig. 4). Treatment with DFMO similarly depleted Spd in all cell lines. In cell lines with WT HDAC10, treatment with N8-AcSpd led to a dose-dependent restoration of both Spd and spermine (Spm) levels, with very little accumulation of the acetylated metabolite below the highest dose level (50 μM). In contrast, N8-AcSpd markedly accumulated in HDAC10KO cells at all concentrations tested, and no significant conversion to Spd was evident, supporting HDAC10 as the sole enzyme responsible for the deacetylation of N8-AcSpd. These data indicate that HDAC10 is an essential component in the metabolism of N8-AcSpd into Spd, allowing its subsequent interconversion within the polyamine metabolic pathway to restore growth-promoting polyamine homeostasis. N8-AcSpd is a metabolite present in feces and the intestinal lumen (19Yoshimoto S. Mitsuyama E. Yoshida K. Odamaki T. Xiao J.Z. Enriched metabolites that potentially promote age-associated diseases in subjects with an elderly-type gut microbiota.Gut Microbes. 2021; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We therefore extended our recent studies using HDAC10-selective inhibitors (20Steimbach R.R. Herbst-Gervasoni C.J. Lechner S. Stewart T.M. Klinke G. Ridinger J. et al.Aza-SAHA derivatives are selective histone deacetylase 10 chemical probes that inhibit polyamine deacetylation and phenocopy HDAC10 knockout.ChemRxiv. 2022; (https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-37shs-v2)Google Scholar) to determine if inhibiting deacetylase activity was sufficient to prevent polyamine restoration and growth rescue by N8-AcSpd in HCT116 colon cancer cells. DKFZ-728 and DKFZ-748 (Fig. 5A) are newly described aza-SAHA derivatives with high biochemical and cellular specificity for HDAC10 over other HDAC isozymes. Incorporating these HDAC10 inhibitors into our growth rescue assays indicated dose-dependent reductions in the ability of N8-AcSpd to allow proliferation in HCT116 cells (Fig. 5B). DKFZ-748 was more effective at preventing rescue than DKFZ-728, consistent with previous biochemical studies indicating greater inhibition of HDAC10 activity by DKFZ-748 (20Steimbach R.R. Herbst-Gervasoni C.J. Lechner S. Stewart T.M. Klinke G. Ridinger J. et al.Aza-SAHA derivatives are selective histone deacetylase 10 chemical probes that inhibit polyamine deacetylation and phenocopy HDAC10 knockout.ChemRxiv. 2022; (https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2021-37shs-v2)Google Scholar). Indeed, at doses of 5 and 10 μM DKFZ-748, the number of cells proliferating in the presence of N8-AcSpd did not significantly differ from those with genetic knockout of HDAC10, suggesting that inhibition of HDAC10 enzymatic activity phenocopies genetic knockout. The structurally related, negative control compound DKFZ-828, which does not have an inhibitory effect on HDAC10 activity, similarly had no inhibitory effect on the rescue of cell growth by N8-AcSpd (Fig. S3). To confirm that the inability of N8-AcSpd to rescue DFMO-mediated growth suppression in the presence of HDAC10 inhibitors is due to continued polyamine depletion, we analyzed intracellular polyamine concentrations following treatment in HCT116 cells (Fig. 5C). Both DKFZ-728 and DKFZ-748 effectively prevented the conversion of N8-AcSpd into Spd, as seen by the intracellular accumulation of the acetylated metabolite, with little increase in Spd or Spm levels. Although DKFZ-748 was again slightly more effective than DKFZ-728, the results with both inhibitors were comparable to those of HDAC10KO cells, further confirming that pharmacologically inhibiting HDAC10 activity reproduces the phenotype observed with its genetic elimination in colorectal cancer cells and that HDAC10 is the sole enzyme responsible for deacetylating N8-AcSpd. Cells were also treated with Trimer44NMe, a polyamine transport inhibitor (PTI) often used in conjunction with DFMO in polyamine-blocking strategies (22Alexander E.T. El Naggar O. Fahey E. Mariner K.

Polyamine transport inhibitors: Design, synthesis, and combination therapies with difluoromethylornithine.J. Med. Chem. 2014; 57: 348-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), to determine its ability to block the import of acetylated spermidine. In both HCT116 and HeLa cells, adding the PTI prevented the uptake of N8-AcSpd, as evidenced by the lack of its conversion to spermidine as well as the absence of N8-AcSpd accumulation in the presence of the HDAC10 inhibitor (Figs. 5C and S4). Furthermore, no rescue of DFMO-mediated growth arrest by N8-AcSpd was evident in the presence of the PTI, which tended to exacerbate the growth inhibitory effects. These results demonstrate that the polyamine-blocking strategy of combining DFMO and Trimer44NMe sufficiently blocks uptake of N8-AcSpd, in addition to the unmodified polyamines. Under normal conditions, N8-AcSpd exists at low levels in cells and tissues and is believed to be rapidly converted to spermidine by a cytosolic polyamine deacetylase that is now known to be HDAC10 (1Hai Y. Shinsky S.A. Porter N.J. Christianson D.W. Histone deacetylase 10 structure and molecular function as a polyamine deacetylase.Nat.

Generally regarded as excretory metabolites, acetylated polyamines such as N8-AcSpd are normal components of urine and feces (19Yoshimoto S. Mitsuyama E. Yoshida K. Odamaki T. Xiao J.Z.

As they have been found to be elevated in association with certain pathologies, they have also been proposed as potential biomarkers, particularly for cancer (30Nakajima T. Katsumata K. Kuwabara H. Soya R. Enomoto M. Ishizaki T. et al.Urinary polyamine biomarker panels with machine-learning differentiated colorectal cancers, benign disease, and healthy controls.Int. J. Mol.

Sunamura M. et al.Urinary charged metabolite profiling of colorectal cancer using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry.Sci. Rep. 2020; 10: 21057Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Enrichment of intracellular N8-AcSpd has been reported in tumor tissue of colorectal cancer patients, while it was undetectable in adjacent normal tissue (32Löser C. Fölsch U.R. Paprotny C. Creutzfeldt W. Polyamines in colorectal cancer. Evaluation of polyamine concentrations in the colon tissue, serum, and urine of 50 patients with colorectal cancer.Cancer. 1990; 65: 958-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Similarly, urinary concentrations of N8-AcSpd in colorectal cancer patients was significantly greater than in healthy volunteers but did not significantly differ from that of patients with benign gastrointestinal disease, most of which were chronic inflammatory conditions associated with malignant potential (32Löser C. Fölsch U.R. Paprotny C. Creutzfeldt W. Polyamines in colorectal cancer. Evaluation of polyamine concentrations in the colon tissue, serum, and urine of 50 patients with colorectal cancer.Cancer. 1990; 65: 958-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Increased intracellular levels of N8-AcSpd have also been measured in colonic intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) taken from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients at the most severely inflamed mucosal areas (33Weiss T.S. Herfarth H. Obermeier F. Ouart J. Vogl D. Scholmerich J. et al.Intracellular polyamine levels of intestinal epithelial cells in inflammatory bowel disease.Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2004; 10: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting increased uptake. Breakdown of the mucosal barrier during IBD pathogenesis allows increased exposure of IECs to microbiota and metabolites, including endogenous polyamines released by necrotic or damaged cells. As colonic epithelial cells must proliferate and migrate to repair the epithelial barrier, their requirement for polyamines is increased, likely stimulating both biosynthesis and uptake (34Rao J.N. Xiao L. Wang J.Y. Polyamines in gut epithelial renewal and barrier function.Physiology (Bethesda). 2020; 35: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A recent study directly demonstrated that microbiota-derived polyamines can be incorporated into host colonocytes to accelerate epithelial renewal (35Nakamura A. Kurihara S. Takahashi D. Ohashi W. Nakamura Y. Kimura S. et al.Symbiotic polyamine metabolism regulates epithelial proliferation and macrophage differentiation in the colon.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Our studies indicate the important potential that extracellular acetylated polyamines, specifically N8-AcSpd, may serve as a source of polyamines for rapidly proliferating cells with increased requirements for polyamines – a nearly ubiquitous characteristic of tumor cells. Age-related changes in the composition of the microbiota are especially apparent in elderly populations and are associated with chronic low levels of inflammation. A comparison of fecal metabolites in elderly patients found elevated levels of N8-AcSpd in a patient population with an “elderly” type gut microbiota versus those with an age-mismatched, “adult” type microbiota generally associated with a younger population (11.6 nmol/g feces v. 7.4 nmol/g feces, respectively) (19Yoshimoto S. Mitsuyama E. Yoshida K. Odamaki T. Xiao J.Z. Enriched metabolites that potentially promote age-associated diseases in subjects with an elderly-type gut microbiota.Gut Microbes. 2021; 13: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Notably, these authors also showed that treatment of HCT116 colon cancer cells with N8-AcSpd induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prevented oxaliplatin-mediated cytotoxicity. It is not currently known if a role exists for HDAC10 in these gene expression changes. N8-AcSpd has also been shown to increase with age in the rat kidney, alongside an increase in spermidine acetyltransferase activities (36Ferioli M.E. Sessa A. Tunici P. Pinotti O. Perin A. Aging and polyamine acetylation in rat kidney.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As de novo polyamine biosynthesis decreases with age in many tissues (37Minois N. Carmona-Gutierrez D. Madeo F. Polyamines in aging and disease.Aging. 2011; 3: 716-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), it has been suggested that maintaining acetylated spermidine pools, including N8-AcSpd, might compensate by increasing polyamine interconversion (36Ferioli M.E. Sessa A. Tunici P. Pinotti O. Perin A. Aging and polyamine acetylation in rat kidney.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1317: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In fact, HDAC10 is highly expressed in the kidney, as well as the spleen and liver (38Tong J.J. Liu J. Bertos N.R. Yang X.J. Identification of HDAC10, a novel class II human histone deacetylase containing a leucine-rich domain.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1114-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Similarly, analyses of plasma metabolites in the long-lived naked mole rat revealed elevated N8-AcSpd levels, compared to mice of similar developmental stage, in the absence of the age-related decline in spermidine observed in other mammals (39Viltard M. Durand S. Perez-Lanzon M. Aprahamian F. Lefevre D. Leroy C. et al.The metabolomic signature of extreme longevity: Naked mole rats versus mice.Aging. 2019; 11: 4783-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The role of HDAC10 in supporting malignancy appears to be context dependent and may relate to the availability of N8-AcSpd in the TME. Expression levels of HDAC10 in cancer patients are seen to correlate both favorably and unfavorably with patient prognosis, depending on tumor origin (40Uhlen M. Zhang C. Lee S. Sjostedt E. Fagerberg L. Bidkhori G. et al.A pathology atlas of the human cancer transcriptome.Science. 2017; 357https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Kaplan-Meier curves available at the Human Protein Atlas (proteinatlas.org) (40Uhlen M. Zhang C. Lee S. Sjostedt E. Fagerberg L. Bidkhori G. et al.A pathology atlas of the human cancer transcriptome.Science. 2017; 357https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar) demonstrate that cancers in which high HDAC10 expression is associated with poor prognosis include those that are associated with TMEs enriched in excretory products, including renal cancer and colon adenocarcinoma. A recent analysis of TCGA data reported HDAC10 copy number gains as a risk factor for colorectal and pancreatic cancers (41Zhang T. Wang B. Gu B. Su F. Xiang L. Liu L. et al.Genetic and molecular characterization revealed the prognosis efficiency of histone acetylation in pan-digestive cancers.J. Oncol. 2022; 2022: 3938652PubMed Google Scholar). A study of colon cancer patients in China reported constitutively elevated expression of HDAC10 protein in tumor tissues compared to paired adjacent tissue in the majority of patients (9Tao X. Yan Y.

https://openalex.org/W4292212553,"The N-glycans attached to proteins contain various GlcNAc branches, the aberrant formation of which correlates with various diseases. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase-IVa (GnT-IVa or MGAT4A) and Gnt-IVb (or MGAT4B) are isoenzymes that catalyze the formation of the β1,4-GlcNAc branch in N-glycans. However, the functional differences between these isozymes remain unresolved. Here, using cellular and UDP-Glo enzyme assays, we discovered that GnT-IVa and GnT-IVb have distinct glycoprotein preferences both in cells and in vitro. Notably, we show that GnT-IVb acted efficiently on glycoproteins bearing an N-glycan premodified by GnT-IV. To further understand the mechanism of this reaction, we focused on the noncatalytic C-terminal lectin domain, which selectively recognizes the product glycans. Replacement of a nonconserved amino acid in the GnT-IVb lectin domain with the corresponding residue in GnT-IVa altered the glycoprotein preference of GnT-IVb to resemble that of GnT-IVa. Our findings demonstrate that the C-terminal lectin domain regulates differential substrate selectivity of GnT-IVa and GnT-IVb, highlighting a new mechanism by which N-glycan branches are formed on glycoproteins."

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) approaches are increasingly being used to generate multi-locus data for genetic structure determination. This study presents the genetic structure of a fodder species -Trema orientalis based on two genome-wide high-throughput diversity array technology (DArT) markers; silicoDArT and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genotyping of 119 individuals generated 40,650 silicoDArT and 4767 SNP markers. Both marker types had a high average scoring reproducibility (>99%). Genetic relationships explored by principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) showed that the first principal coordinate axis explained most of the variation in both the SilicoDArT (34.2%) and SNP (89.6%) marker data. The average polymorphic information content did not highly differ between silicoDArT (0.22) and SNPs (0.17) suggesting minimal differences in informativeness in the two groups of markers. The, mean observed (Ho) and expected (He) heterozygosity were low and differed between the silicoDArT and SNPs respectively, estimated at Ho = 0.08 and He = 0.05 for silicoDArT and Ho = 0.23 and He = 0.19 for SNPs. The population of T. orientalis was moderately differentiated (FST = 0.20-0.53) and formed 2 distinct clusters based on maximum likelihood and principal coordinates analysis. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that clusters contributed more to the variation (46.3-60.8%) than individuals (32.9-31.2%). Overall, the results suggest a high relatedness of the individuals sampled and a threatened genetic potential of T. orientalis in the wild. Therefore, genetic management activities such as ex-situ germplasm management are required for the sustainability of the species. Ex-situ conservation efforts should involve core collection of individuals from different populations to capture efficient diversity. This study demonstrates the importance of silicoDArT and SNP makers in population structure and genetic diversity analysis of Trema orientalis, useful for future genome wide studies in the species."

Trust and trusting relationships in nursing education form the foundation of safety, acknowledging vulnerabilities and allowing reciprocal expectations and beliefs to rely on each other during the teaching and learning process. The purpose of this article is to explore the views of nurse educators in facilitating trust and trusting relationships during teaching and learning.This article focuses on the role of educators in facilitating the development of trust. A qualitative approach with a grounded theory design was used. The fourteen nurse educators included to address the first objective of the study, were purposively sampled, and the requisite data was collected by conducting individual in-depth face-to-face interviews. Initial, focus and theoretical coding were used to analyse the data until saturation was evident. The following themes emerged: competencies of the educator; setting of standards and the maintaining of consistency; and professional credibility and the value of trusting relationships. The outcome of the findings indicated that the educator plays a key role in establishing trust in nursing education. The study did not include professional nurses in practice as role-players in the nursing education environment. This could be regarded as a limitation, as the professional nurse in practice also has a teaching role, thus, indirectly, forming part of the nursing education environment. A recommendation was made that further research on trust should include professional nurses.The study highlights that trust is dependent on, and facilitated by, professional conduct, ethical behaviour, competencies, knowledge and skills of the role-players in the teaching and learning environment. The recommendations made have a bearing on developing trust and trusting relationships in nursing education."
https://openalex.org/W4292636174,"In this article, we investigate the chronological change of settlements of the Lower Xiajiadian (LXJD) culture in northeast China. On the basis of excavation data, two types of settlements can be identified based on the methods of site construction: earthen (rammed earth/mudbrick) settlements and stone-constructed settlements. After integrating and reanalyzing all published 14 C radiocarbon data of different LXJD sites, we argue that there is a clear chronological difference between these two types of settlements. It is revealed by the OxCal model that settlements built with earthen structures are generally earlier than those constructed with stones, and the changes in settlement spatial distribution and constructive material largely happened after 1500 BC. By means of correlation analysis with other related archaeological evidence, we suggest that the underlying social dynamics that contributed to LXJD settlement changes can be explored through multiple prospects."
https://openalex.org/W4292675889,"The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an ATP-dependent proton pump that governs the pH of various intracellular compartments and also functions at the plasma membrane in certain cell types, including cancer cells. Membrane targeting of the V-ATPase is controlled by isoforms of subunit a, and we have previously shown that isoforms a3 and a4 are important for the migration and invasion of several breast cancer cell lines in vitro. Using CRISPR-mediated genome editing to selectively disrupt each of the four a subunit isoforms, we also recently showed that a4 is critical to plasma membrane V-ATPase localization, as well as in vitro migration and invasion of 4T1-12B murine breast cancer cells. We now report that a4 is important for the growth of 4T1-12B tumors in vivo. We found that BALB/c mice bearing a4-/- 4T1-12B allografts had significantly smaller tumors than mice in the control group. In addition, we determined that a4-/- allografts showed dramatically reduced metastases to the lung and reduced luminescence intensity of metastases to bone relative to the control group. Taken together, these results suggest that the a4 isoform of the V-ATPase represents a novel potential therapeutic target to limit breast cancer growth and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W4292239891,"Preproinsulin entry into the endoplasmic reticulum yields proinsulin, and its subsequent delivery to the distal secretory pathway leads to processing, storage, and secretion of mature insulin. Multiple groups have reported that treatment of pancreatic beta cell lines, rodent pancreatic islets, or human islets with proteasome inhibitors leads to diminished proinsulin and insulin protein levels, diminished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and changes in beta-cell gene expression that ultimately lead to beta-cell death. However, these studies have mostly examined treatment times far beyond that needed to achieve acute proteasomal inhibition. Here, we report that although proteasomal inhibition immediately downregulates new proinsulin biosynthesis, it nevertheless acutely increases beta-cell proinsulin levels in pancreatic beta cell lines, rodent pancreatic islets, and human islets, indicating rescue of a pool of recently synthesized WT INS gene product that would otherwise be routed to proteasomal disposal. Our pharmacological evidence suggests that this disposal most likely reflects ongoing endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation. However, we found that within 60 min after proteasomal inhibition, intracellular proinsulin levels begin to fall in conjunction with increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha, which can be inhibited by blocking the general control nonderepressible 2 kinase. Together, these data demonstrate that a meaningful subfraction of newly synthesized INS gene product undergoes rapid proteasomal disposal. We propose that free amino acids derived from proteasomal proteolysis may potentially participate in suppressing general control nonderepressible 2 kinase activity to maintain ongoing proinsulin biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4292416883,"Unusual nucleic acid structures play vital roles as intermediates in many cellular processes and, in the case of peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-mediated triplexes, are leveraged as tools for therapeutic gene editing. However, due to their transient nature, an understanding of the factors that interact with and process dynamic nucleic acid structures remains limited. Here, we developed snapELISA (structure-specific nucleic acid-binding protein ELISA), a rapid high-throughput platform to interrogate and compare up to 2688 parallel nucleic acid structure-protein interactions in vitro. We applied this system to both triplex-forming oligonucleotide-induced DNA triplexes and DNA-bound PNA heterotriplexes to describe the identification of previously known and novel interactors for both structures. For PNA heterotriplex recognition analyses, snapELISA identified factors implicated in nucleotide excision repair (XPA, XPC), single-strand annealing repair (RAD52), and recombination intermediate structure binding (TOP3A, BLM, MUS81). We went on to validate selected factor localization to genome-targeted PNA structures within clinically relevant loci in human cells. Surprisingly, these results demonstrated XRCC5 localization to PNA triplex-forming sites in the genome, suggesting the presence of a double-strand break intermediate. These results describe a powerful comparative approach for identifying structure-specific nucleic acid interactions and expand our understanding of the mechanisms of triplex structure recognition and repair."

Improper management of infusion bottle waste can have an impact on disease transmission. The medical waste treatment used high technology and high costs will be a financial burden, so simple and effective treatment innovations is needed. This study uses an experimental method of removing bacteria from infusion bottles using a mixture of water and Andoso soil as a solution for washing infusion bottle waste. The soil solution concentration used in washing was 45% with a contact time of 2 minutes. The experiment was carried out with two repetitions. The treatment effect on decreasing the number of bacteria using a multiple linear regression mathematical model. The results showed that the disinfection process of bacterial-contaminated infusion bottles using water required rinsing up to six times, whereas using 45% andosol soil solution only rinsed once. The effectiveness of the disinfection of infusion bottles contaminated with bacteria using soil solution reduces the number of bacteria by 98%."
https://openalex.org/W4292636143,"Cryptoassets flow among players as recorded in the ledger of blockchain for all the transactions, comprising a network of players as nodes and flows as edges. The last decade, on the other hand, has witnessed repeating bubbles and crashes of the price of cryptoassets in exchange markets with fiat currencies and other cryptos. We study the relationship between these two important aspects of dynamics, one in the bubble/crash of price and the other in the daily network of crypto, by investigating Bitcoin and XRP. We focus on “regular players” who frequently appear on a weekly basis during a period of time including bubble/crash, and quantify each player’s role with respect to outgoing and incoming flows by defining flow-weighted frequency. During the most significant period of one-year starting from the winter of 2017, we discovered the structure of three groups of players in the diagram of flow-weighted frequency, which is common to Bitcoin and XRP in spite of the different nature of the two cryptos. By examining the identity and business activity of some regular players in the case of Bitcoin, we can observe different roles of them, namely the players balancing surplus and deficit of cryptoassets (Bal-branch), those accumulating the cryptoassets (In-branch), and those reducing it (Out-branch). Using this information, we found that the regime switching among Bal-, In-, Out-branches was presumably brought about by the regular players who are not necessarily dominant and stable in the case of Bitcoin, while such players are simply absent in the case of XRP. We further discuss how one can understand the temporal transitions among the three branches."
https://openalex.org/W4292636159,"As a sequential modulation of conflict, congruency sequence effect indexes a conflict-induced performance improvement, which is observed as reduced congruency effects for trials after the incongruent trials than for trials after the congruent trials. Although congruency sequence effect has been investigated widely in healthy humans, the studies of distributional characteristics across prototypical congruency tasks are scarce. To investigate this issue, the present study adopts the between-subjects design to carry out three experiments, where subjects were separately informed to perform the Stroop, word Flanker, and letter Flanker tasks. The results showed that congruency sequence effect occurred in the congruent and incongruent trials in the Stroop and word Flanker tasks, respectively, and absented in the letter Flanker task, which is interpreted as the differences in the nature and difficulty of the tasks. The distributional properties of congruency sequence effect did not significantly differ from the Gaussian distribution in the Stroop and word Flanker tasks, but not in the letter Flanker task, suggesting the inter-individual variability of congruency sequence effect depends on the nature of tasks. Importantly, the delta plot analyses showed pronouncedly increased congruency sequence effect over the slowest percentile bines in both the Stroop and word Flanker tasks, verifying the activation suppression hypothesis. Altogether, the present study enriches the literature on the distributional characteristics of congruency sequence effect."
https://openalex.org/W4292636190,"Background Snakebite is possibly the most neglected of the NTDs (Neglected Tropical Diseases). Half of the global deaths due to venomous snakebites, estimated at 100,000 per year, occur in India. The only representative data on snakebite available from India is the mortality data from the RGI-MDS study (Registrar General of India- 1 Million Death Study) and another study on mortality from the state of Bihar. Incidence data on snakebite is available for 2 districts of the state of West Bengal only. Hospital-based data on snakebite admissions and use of ASV are gross underestimates as most snakebite victims in rural India depend more on alternate treatment methods which do not get represented in National registries. The proposed study is a multi-centric study to determine the incidence, morbidity, mortality and economic burden of snakebites in India covering all 5 geographical zones of the country. Protocol A community level surveillance for snakebite covering 31 districts in 13 states of India in order to obtain annual incidence of snakebites from the community. Frontline health workers will be trained to gather information on new cases of snakebite over the study period of 1-year, from “wards “(smallest administrative subunit of a village or town) that they represent in the study districts. Dedicated field officers would collect data on snakebites, victim characteristics, outcomes, utilization of health facilities on a questionnaire sheet designed for this purpose. The study duration is for 18 months from April 2022 to October 2023. Discussion The study would be the first of its kind in India looking prospectively at the incidence of snakebite covering 13 states in 5 zones of India and a population of 84 million. Our study covers 6.12% of the total population of the country as compared to the incidence study conducted in Sri Lanka which covered 1% of the total population."
https://openalex.org/W4292636204,"Introduction Since Friedman’s seminal publication on laboring women, numerous publications have sought to define normal labor progress. However, there is paucity of data on contemporary labor cervicometry incorporating both maternal and neonatal outcomes. The objective of this study is to establish intrapartum prediction models of unfavorable labor outcomes using machine-learning algorithms. Materials and methods Consortium on Safe Labor is a large database consisting of pregnancy and labor characteristics from 12 medical centers in the United States. Outcomes, including maternal and neonatal outcomes, were retrospectively collected. We defined primary outcome as the composite of following unfavorable outcomes: cesarean delivery in active labor, postpartum hemorrhage, intra-amniotic infection, shoulder dystocia, neonatal morbidity, and mortality. Clinical and obstetric parameters at admission and during labor progression were used to build machine-learning risk-prediction models based on the gradient boosting algorithm. Results Of 228,438 delivery episodes, 66,586 were eligible for this study. Mean maternal age was 26.95 ± 6.48 years, mean parity was 0.92 ± 1.23, and mean gestational age was 39.35 ± 1.13 weeks. Unfavorable labor outcome was reported in 14,439 (21.68%) deliveries. Starting at a cervical dilation of 4 cm, the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) of prediction models increased from 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.75) to 0.89 (95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.90) at a dilation of 10 cm. Baseline labor risk score was above 35% in patients with unfavorable outcomes compared to women with favorable outcomes, whose score was below 25%. Conclusion Labor risk score is a machine-learning–based score that provides individualized and dynamic alternatives to conventional labor charts. It predicts composite of adverse birth, maternal, and neonatal outcomes as labor progresses. Therefore, it can be deployed in clinical practice to monitor labor progress in real time and support clinical decisions."
https://openalex.org/W4292636206,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a human pathogen that colonizes the naso and/or oropharynx and can cause otitis, pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis. To broaden the protection against pneumococcus, several pneumococcal proteins have been investigated as vaccine candidates. In this study we analyzed the immunological response induced by mouse subcutaneous immunization with a fusion of the Polyamine transport protein D (PotD) and a pneumolysin derivative (PdT), resulting in a hybrid rPotD-PdT protein. Immunization of mice with rPotD-PdT induced increased production of nitric oxide, indicating a higher innate immune response. In agreement, immunization of mice with the hybrid protein was more immunogenic than the individual proteins or their combination, eliciting higher antibody levels. The anti-rPotD-PdT IgG displayed increased binding onto the pneumococcal surface. Furthermore, the anti-rPotD-PdT antisera promoted superior opsonophagocytosis as compared with the other tested formulations. However, despite that the encouraging results in vitro, immunization with the hybrid was not sufficient to induce protection against sepsis with a highly virulent pneumococcal strain. taken together, the results suggest that hybrid proteins are an interesting strategy, able to promote improved immune responses, but the inclusion of other antigens may be necessary to promote protection against invasive infections caused by this bacterium."

Population-based cross-sectional multidisciplinary study in design. Data from structured questionnaires, geriatric tests, and scales were obtained from all study participants who underwent anthropometric and blood pressure measurements during three home visits. Assessment of thyroid function was based on TSH serum measurements.The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the Polish population aged 60 years or above was estimated at 15.5% (21.5% in women and 7.2% in men), with 3.2% of undiagnosed individuals among them. The prevalence of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism in the studied group was 13.9% (19.4% in women and 6.3% in men) and 1.6% (2.1% in women and 0.9% in men) respectively, untreated hypothyroidism was revealed in 21.9% (in 160 out of 732 subjects) and untreated hyperthyroidism in 34.2% of subjects (in 41 out of 120 participants). In multiple regression analysis independent risk factors for thyroid disorders being untreated were older age (> 75 years), male sex, a low education level (primary or lower), and low utilization of medical services.One-fifth of Polish Caucasian seniors with hypothyroidism and one-third with hyperthyroidism are untreated. Older, poorly educated and rarely utilizing medical services seniors, especially men, are more frequently untreated for thyroid dysfunction and some of them do not benefit from contemporary achievements in medicine."

Taiwan is a small country with a high-density population. It particularly has a considerable number of locomotives. Furthermore, Taiwan's traffic accident fatality rate increased by 23.84% in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily because of human factors. Road safety has long been a challenging problem in Taiwanese cities. This study collected public data pertaining to traffic accidents from the Taoyuan city government in Taiwan and generated six datasets based on the various accident frequencies at the same location. To find key attributes, this study proposes a three-stage dimension reduction to filter attributes, which includes removing multicollinear attributes, the integrated attribute selection method, and statistical factor analysis. We applied five rule-based classifiers to classify six different frequency datasets and generate the rules of accident severity. The order of top ten key attributes was hit vehicle > certificate type > vehicle > action type > drive quality > escape > accident type > gender > job > trip purposes in the maximum accident frequency CF ≥ 10 dataset. When locomotives, bicycles, and people collide with other locomotives or trucks, injury or death can easily occur, and the motorcycle riders are at the highest risk. The findings of this study provide a reference for governments and stakeholders to reduce the road accident risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W4292636240,"Background Historically, high levels of morbidity and mortality have been associated with cardiovascular disease in the Northern Ireland population. Previously reported associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and cardiovascular disease within other populations have not always been consistent. Objective To investigate associations between 33 SNPs with fatal or non-fatal incident coronary heart disease (CHD) events and all-cause mortality in the Northern Irish participants of the Prospective Epidemiological Study of Myocardial Infarction (PRIME). Method Phase 2 of the PRIME study prospectively evaluated 2,010 men aged 58–74 years in Northern Ireland for more than 10 years for incident CHD events (myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass, and cardiac death) and more than 15 years for all-cause mortality. SNPs previously reported in association with cardiovascular outcomes were evaluated against incident CHD events and all-cause mortality using Cox’s proportional hazards models adjusted for established cardiovascular disease risk factors. Results During the follow-up period, 177 incident CHD events were recorded, and 821 men died. Both BCMO1 rs6564851 (Hazard ratio [HR] = 0.76; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.60–0.96; P = 0.02) and TGFB1 rs1800469 (HR = 1.30; CI: 1.02–1.65; P = 0.04) were significantly associated with incident CHD events in adjusted models. Only IL1B rs16944 was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (HR = 1.18; CI: 1.05–1.33; P = 0.005). No associations remained significant following Bonferonni correction for multiple testing. Conclusion We report a novel association between BCMO1 rs6564851 and risk of incident CHD events. In addition, TGFB1 rs1800469 and IL1B rs16944 were associated with the risk of incident CHD events and all-cause mortality outcomes respectively, supporting previously reported associations."
https://openalex.org/W4292656976,"Introduction The use of portable gait measurement systems in research is appealing to collect real-world data at low-cost, low participant burden, and without requirement for dedicated lab space. Most commercially available inertial measurement units (IMU’s) designed for running only capture temporospatial data, the ability to capture biomechanics data such as shock and motion metrics with the RunScribe IMU makes it the closest to a lab alternative. The RunScribe system has been validated in running, however, is yet to be validated for walking. Method Qualisys motion capture, AMTI force plates, and Delsys Trigno accelerometers were used as gold standard lab measures for comparison against the RunScribe IMU. Twenty participants completed 10 footsteps per foot (20 total) measured by both systems simultaneously. Variables for validation included: Vertical Ground reaction force (GRF), instantaneous GRF rate, pronation excursion, pronation velocity, total shock, impact force, braking force. Interclass correlation (ICC) was used to determine agreement between the measurement systems, mean differences were used to evaluate group level accuracy. Results ICC results showed moderate agreement between measurement systems when both limbs were averaged. The greatest agreement was seen for GRF rate, pronation excursion, and pronation velocity (ICC = 0.627, 0.616, 0.539), low agreement was seen for GRF, total shock, impact shock, braking shock (ICC = 0.269, 0.351, 0.244, 0.180). However mean differences show the greatest level of accuracy for GRF, GRF rate, and impact shock. Discussion Results show mixed agreement between the RunScribe and gold standard lab measures, and varied agreement across left and right limbs. Kinematic variables showed the greatest agreement, however GRF had the lowest relative mean difference for group results. The results show acceptable levels of agreement for most variables, however further work must be done to assess the repeatability and sensitivity of the RunScribe to be applied within areas such as footwear testing and gait retraining protocols."
https://openalex.org/W4292657361,"Background Segment-specific variations of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) have not been assessed in South Asian populations. The purpose of this study was to determine if segment-specific CIMTs or a composite-CIMT score is a better risk predictor of coronary heart disease in South Asian populations. Methods A comparative prospective study was conducted from November 2019 to October 2020 in a hospital in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, cases (having a diagnosis of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), n = 338) and controls (non-CHD group, n = 356) were recruited. Ultrasound examination of the common carotid (CCA), the carotid bulb (CB) and the internal carotid segments (ICA) of the carotid vessels was conducted by a radiologist, and CIMTs were measured. A composite-CIMT score defined as the average value of all six segments of the left and right sides was derived. Results 694 participants were enrolled (male n = 399, 57.5%). The mean (±SD) age of the study sample was 60.2 (±9.86) years. There were variations in segment-specific values between the left and right vessels. The mean composite-CIMT value of the CHD group was significantly higher than that of the non-CHD group. A composite-CIMT score of 0.758 had a sensitivity of 98.4% and a specificity of 64.6% in distinguishing CHD from non-CHD groups (Area under the curve (AUC): 0.926). Conclusions Carotid artery segment-specific CIMT variations were present in this population. The composite CIMT score is better than segment-specific CIMTs in predicting CHD and may be used to predict CHD in this population."

Globally, computer user adults experience a surge in the prevalence of dry eye. Data is insufficient on the prevalence of dry eye disease among postgraduate students in Ethiopia. Therefore, the present was aimed to assess the prevalence of dry eye and its associated factors among postgraduate students at the University of Gondar, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 423 postgraduate students who were selected based on a simple random sampling technique. Data was collected through online symptom-based ocular surface disease index questionnaire. Binary logistic regression was used to test the association and p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered to determine the significance of the association. Results From the total postgraduate students, 404 completed the study with a response rate of 95.5%. The prevalence of symptomatic dry eye disease was 50.5% (95% CI, 45.1%-54.9%). Average continuous visual display unit use for 2-4hours per day[AOR = 2.57 (95% CI, 1.27–5.21)] and for&gt; 4hours per day[AOR = 3.77 (95% CI 1.87–7.59)], duration of visual display unit use for 3–5 years [AOR = 2.24 (95% CI, 1.17–4.31)], 6–8 years [AOR = 2.46 (95% CI,1.31–4.62)] and &gt; 8 years [AOR = 3.25 (95% CI, 1.63–6.48)], average sleeping hour &lt; 7 hours/day within last week [AOR = 2.17 (95% CI, 1.35–3.49)] and current known allergic conjunctivitis [AOR = 5.42 (95% CI, 2.43–12.10)] were significantly associated with symptomatic dry eye disease. Conclusion and recommendation In this study, about half of postgraduate students faced symptomatic dry eye disease. Significant association was observed between symptomatic dry eye disease and average continuous hours of visual display unit use, duration of visual display unit use in years, shortage of sleep and current known allergic conjunctivitis. It is advisable for postgraduate students to limit screen exposure hour and establish regular breaking time along their exposure. It is also advisable to have optimum sleep as possible. It is also important to explore dry eye disease on a large sample incorporating clinical tests."

Based on the simulation results of wind flow velocity contour, pressure contour and isochronous flow vector distribution, the influence mechanism of wind flow and coal dust characteristics on the distribution of wind flow and coal dust diffusion in the roadway is analysed, and a dust control and reduction system and treatment scheme with new pneumatic screw spray technology as the core is proposed to suppress coal dust pollution at the reloading point. The results of the study show that the wind flow distribution is mainly influenced by the intersection of tape traction and cross-roadway wind flow, showing a complex multi-layer distribution along the roadway and in the normal direction; the diffusion of coal dust of different particle sizes is influenced by the roadway wind flow, and coal dust with particle sizes in the range of 10μm~20μm is more easily diffused, and the dust with particle sizes in the range of 20μm~45μm is mainly collected and suspended near the vortex wind flow at the cross-roadway. The coal dust in the range of 20 μm~45 μm is more likely to gather in the vortex; the treatment system effectively controls the coal dust inside the dust cover, and the spiral-shaped transported droplet particle group formed by the pneumatic spiral spray combines with it efficiently, which verifies the dust control and reduction effect of the pneumatic spiral spray system at the transfer point, and the dust removal efficiency reaches 89.35%~93.06%, which provides relevant theoretical support for the treatment of dust pollution at the coal transfer point in underground coal mines It provides the theoretical support and means to control dust pollution at underground coal transfer points."

Vaccines' use may change the epidemiological characters of HFMD. Spatial autocorrelation analysis and space-time scan statistics analysis were used to explore the spatiotemporal distribution pattern of this disease at the provincial level in mainland China. The effects of meteorological factors, socio-economic factors, and health resources on HFMD incidence were analyzed using Geodetector. Interrupted time series (ITS) was used to analyze the impact of the EV-A71 vaccine on the incidence of HFMD. This study found that the median annual incidence of HFMD was 153.78 per 100,000 (ranging from 120.79 to 205.06) in mainland China from 2011 to 2018. Two peaks of infections were observed per year. Children 5 years and under were the main morbid population. The spatial distribution of HFMD was presented a significant clustering pattern in each year (P<0.001). The distribution of HFMD cases was clustered in time and space. The range of cluster time was between April and October. The most likely cluster appeared in the southern coastal provinces (Guangxi, Guangdong, Hainan) from 2011 to 2017 and in the eastern coastal provinces (Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang) in 2018. The spatial heterogeneity of HFMD incidence could be attributed to meteorological factors, socioeconomic factors, and health resource. After introducing the EV-A71 vaccine, the instantaneous level of HFMD incidence decreased at the national level, and HFMD incidence trended downward in the southern coastal provinces and increased in the eastern coastal provinces. The prevention and control policies of HFMD should be adapted to local conditions in different provinces. It is necessary to advance the EV-A71 vaccination plan, expand the vaccine coverage and develop multivalent HFMD vaccines as soon as possible."
https://openalex.org/W4292676243,"Enzymes involved in Staphylococcus aureus amino acid metabolism have recently gained traction as promising targets for the development of new antibiotics, however, not all aspects of this process are understood. The ATP-grasp superfamily includes enzymes that predominantly catalyze the ATP-dependent ligation of various carboxylate and amine substrates. One subset, ʟ-amino acid ligases (LALs), primarily catalyze the formation of dipeptide products in Gram-positive bacteria, however, their involvement in S. aureus amino acid metabolism has not been investigated. Here, we present the characterization of the putative ATP-grasp enzyme (SAOUHSC_02373) from S. aureus NCTC 8325 and its identification as a novel LAL. First, we interrogated the activity of SAOUHSC_02373 against a panel of ʟ-amino acid substrates. As a result, we identified SAOUHSC_02373 as an LAL with high selectivity for ʟ-aspartate and ʟ-methionine substrates, specifically forming an ʟ-aspartyl-ʟ-methionine dipeptide. Thus, we propose that SAOUHSC_02373 be assigned as ʟ-aspartate-ʟ-methionine ligase (LdmS). To further understand this unique activity, we investigated the mechanism of LdmS by X-ray crystallography, molecular modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis. Our results suggest that LdmS shares a similar mechanism to other ATP-grasp enzymes but possesses a distinctive active site architecture that confers selectivity for the ʟ-Asp and ʟ-Met substrates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed LdmS homologs are highly conserved in Staphylococcus and closely related Gram-positive Firmicutes. Subsequent genetic analysis upstream of the ldmS operon revealed several trans-acting regulatory elements associated with control of Met and Cys metabolism. Together, these findings support a role for LdmS in Staphylococcal sulfur amino acid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4292136256,"Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) is an important neuronal target of extracellular signal–regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) involved in Raf signaling pathways, but mechanistic details of MAP2 phosphorylation are unclear. Here, we used NMR spectroscopy to quantitatively describe the kinetics of phosphorylation of individual serines and threonines in the embryonic MAP2 variant MAP2c. We carried out real-time monitoring of phosphorylation to discover major phosphorylation sites that were not identified in previous studies relying on specific antibodies. Our comparison with the phosphorylation of MAP2c by a model cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 and with phosphorylation of the MAP2c homolog Tau revealed differences in phosphorylation profiles that explain specificity of regulation of biological functions of MAP2c and Tau. To probe the molecular basis of the regulatory effect of ERK2, we investigated the interactions of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated MAP2c by NMR with single-residue resolution. As ERK2 phosphorylates mostly outside the regions binding microtubules, we studied the binding of proteins other than tubulin, namely regulatory subunit RIIα of cAMP-dependent PKA, adapter protein Grb2, Src homology domain 3 of tyrosine kinases Fyn and Abl, and ERK2 itself. We found ERK2 phosphorylation interfered mostly with binding to proline-rich regions of MAP2c. Furthermore, our NMR experiments in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell lysates showed that the kinetics of dephosphorylation are compatible with in-cell NMR studies and that residues targeted by ERK2 and PKA are efficiently phosphorylated in the cell lysates. Taken together, our results provide a deeper characterization of MAP2c phosphorylation and its effects on interactions with other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4292212576,"Sterols in eukaryotic cells play important roles in modulating membrane fluidity and in cell signaling and trafficking. During evolution, a combination of gene losses and acquisitions gave rise to an extraordinary diversity of sterols in different organisms. The sterol C-22 desaturase identified in plants and fungi as a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase evolved from the first eukaryotic cytochrome P450 and was lost in many lineages. Although the ciliate <i>Tetrahymena thermophila</i> desaturates sterols at the C-22 position, no cytochrome P-450 orthologs are present in the genome. Here, we aim to identify the genes responsible for the desaturation as well as their probable origin. We used gene knockout and yeast heterologous expression approaches to identify two putative genes, retrieved from a previous transcriptomic analysis, as sterol C-22 desaturases. Furthermore, we demonstrate using bioinformatics and evolutionary analyses that both genes encode a novel type of sterol C-22 desaturase that belongs to the large fatty acid hydroxylase/desaturase superfamily and the genes originated by genetic duplication prior to functional diversification. These results stress the widespread existence of nonhomologous isofunctional enzymes among different lineages of the tree of life as well as the suitability for the use of <i>T. thermophila</i> as a valuable model to investigate the evolutionary process of large enzyme families."
https://openalex.org/W4292635869,"Online surveys are becoming the dominant form for survey data collection. This presents a problem for the measurement of political knowledge, because, according to recent scholarship, unsupervised measurement of political knowledge in web-based surveys suffers from respondent dishonesty. This study examines the validity of five possible survey proxies for political knowledge: self-assessed sophistication, political interest, internal political efficacy, accuracy of party placements on a left-right dimension and political participation. The analysis draws on a 2020 survey data (n = 1,097) and partial replications with identical measures from a 2008 survey data (n = 1,021) from Finland. Through several tests, the five proxies are assessed in terms of convergent validity, criterion validity and predictive validity. Across all tests, political interest performs best on all dimensions of validity and demonstrates largely identical relationships with political knowledge. Although the survey measurement of political interest and political knowledge may partly tap into slightly different constructs, the analysis supports the conclusion that political interest is the most suitable survey proxy for political knowledge from among the five proxy candidates included in the analysis."

Whether type of treatment modifies outcome with or without CSP is also analysed.A secondary post hoc subgroup analysis of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial.Brief or standard short psychotherapy.Based on baseline assessment, the sample was subdivided into a subgroup with and a subgroup without CSP. Work participation and clinical remission of depression and anxiety were assessed as treatment outcome at two-year follow-up. Simple and multivariate logistic regression analyses, across the intervention arms, were applied to evaluate the impact of CSP on treatment outcome. Selected baseline variables were considered as potential confounders and included as variates if relevant. The modifying effect of CSP on treatment outcome was evaluated by including intervention modality as an interaction term.Among the 236 participants with depressive symptoms, 83 participants (35%) were identified with CSP. In simple logistic regression analysis, CSP reduced improvements on both work participation and clinical remission rate. In the multivariate analysis however, the impact of CSP on work participation and on clinical remission were not significant after adjusting for confounding variables. Reduction of work participation was mainly explained by the higher age of the CSP participants and the reduced clinical remission by the additional co-occurrence of anxiety symptoms at baseline. The occurrence of CSP at baseline did not modify long term outcome of brief compared to short psychotherapy.CSP at baseline reduced work participation and worsened remission of mental health symptoms two-year following psychotherapy. Older age and more severe baseline anxiety are associated to reduced effectiveness. Type of psychotherapy received did not contribute to differences."

Prescriptions dispensed between the last menstrual period (LMP) and the first antenatal care visit (mean 10.7 weeks) (2010-2016) were extracted from the Enhanced Prescribing Database (EPD) which records all prescriptions dispensed by pharmacists in NI. EPD data were linked to NIMATS using the mother's Health and Care Number. Maternal deprivation based on the NI Multiple Deprivation Measure 2017 was linked using the mother's postcode.The cohort included 139,687 pregnancies resulting in live or stillbirths to 106,206 women. A medication was dispensed in 63.5% of pregnancies, and in 48.7% of pregnancies excluding supplements (vitamins, iron, and folic acid). Folic acid was the most commonly dispensed medication (33.1%). Excluding supplements, the mean number of medications was 1.1, with 4.2% having ≥5 medications. The most common non-supplement medications were antibiotics (13.1%), antiemetics (8.7%), analgesics (6.9%), hormonal medications (6.9%) and antidepressants (6.1%). Younger women (<20 years) had more antibiotics while older women (40+ years) had more antidepressants, cardiovascular, antihypertensives, anticoagulant medications and thyroxine. The proportion of women living in the most deprived areas with prescriptions for antidepressants, sedatives, tranquilisers, analgesics, and anti-epileptic medications was double the proportion of women with these medications in the least deprived areas.Half of all pregnant women in NI were dispensed a non-supplement medication between LMP and the first antenatal care visit. Younger and older mothers and those living in the most deprived areas were more likely to have medications dispensed. More antidepressants were dispensed in areas of social deprivation."
https://openalex.org/W4292636092,"Introduction HIV-1 viral Load (VL) testing is recommended for the monitoring of antiretroviral treatment. Dried Blood Spots (DBS) are an effective sample type in resource limited settings, where safe phlebotomy and reliable shipping are hard to guarantee. In HIV high burden countries, high throughput assays can improve access to testing services. The Hologic Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx Assay (Aptima Assay) is a high throughput assay that runs on the CE-IVD approved Panther platform. The objectives of this study were to assess the performance characteristics of Aptima for VL monitoring using plasma and venous DBS specimens and to determine the stability of HIV-1 RNA in DBS. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study of 2227 HIV infected adults visiting health facilities in Nairobi and Busia, Kenya. Each provided a venous blood sample; plasma was prepared from 1312 samples while paired DBS samples and plasma were prepared from the remaining 915 samples. The agreement between the Aptima assay and the Abbott RealTime HIV-1 Assay (Abbott RT) was analysed by comparing the HIV-1 VL in both assays at the medical decision point of 1000 copies/mL. To assess stability of HIV-1 RNA in DBS, VL in DBS spotted on day 0 were compared with that from the same DBS card after 21 days of storage at room temperature. Results Overall, 436 plasma samples had quantifiable results in both Aptima and Abbott RT. The agreement between the two assays at 1000 copies/mL was 97.48% with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient ( r ) of 0.9589 and gave a mean bias of 0.33 log copies/mL on Bland-Altman analysis. For fresh DBS, the agreement in both assays was 94.64% at 1000 copies/mL, with an r of 0.8692 and a mean bias of 0.35 log copies/mL. The overall agreement between DBS tested in Aptima on day 0 versus day 21 was 95.71%, with a mean bias of -0.154. Conclusion The Aptima HIV-1 Quant Dx assay is an accurate test for VL monitoring of HIV-1 using DBS and plasma sample types in Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W4292636319,"Background Individuals experiencing homelessness may be at a disproportionately high risk for hepatitis C (HCV) because they may be more likely to engage in HCV risk behaviors. Community organizations that provide services to these vulnerable individuals can effectively screen, diagnose, and navigate them into HCV care. However, screening people experiencing homelessness for HCV at such organizations is limited by various challenges that remain understudied, including budgetary considerations and strategies to improve teamwork and communication. Accordingly, this study investigated the organizational challenges and facilitators to HCV screening of individuals experiencing homelessness as reported by homeless services providers. Methods Staff (N = 21) at two community organizations in Houston, Texas, completed an interviewer-administered survey and a semi-structured interview in August 2020 to assess the challenges and facilitators to screening people experiencing homelessness for HCV. Interviews were coded, and a thematic analysis was conducted to identify challenges as well as facilitators to HCV screening among individuals experiencing homelessness. Results Almost half of participants were employed in social services (42.86%; n = 9), while the remainder were employed in management/administration and health services. Barriers to HCV screening included funding, logistics, and resource-related challenges; and limited communication and collaboration around HCV screening. Facilitators to HCV screening included providing HCV education and training for all staff; and incentivizing, formalizing, and funding HCV screening. Conclusions Community organizations can help minimize barriers to HCV screening among individuals experiencing homelessness by providing staff with training specific to HCV, client education around HCV and the screening process, and providing clients with incentives for participation, as well as by maximizing community and clinic partnerships to provide linkage to care and services to this high-risk population."
https://openalex.org/W4292656979,"This paper describes two experiments aimed at establishing the orange head cockroach (Eublaberus posticus) as a model organism for behavioral research. While many invertebrate models are available, cockroaches have several benefits over others that show impressive behavioral abilities. Most notably, cockroaches are long-lived generalists that can be maintained in controlled indoor laboratory conditions. While the most popular cockroaches in behavioral research, Periplaneta americana and Blattella germanica, have the potential to become domestic pests, our E. posticus is extremely unlikely to escape or infest a human environment, making it a very practical species. In our first experiment, we investigated the ability of E. posticus to associate novel odors with appetitive and aversive solutions. They quickly learned to approach odors associated with a dog food sucrose solution and learned to avoid odors associated with salt water. The second experiment repeated the methods of the first experiment, while also testing retained preferences for conditioned odors, from 15 to 1,215 minutes after the conditioning procedure ended. We found that preferences for odors associated with food were strongest 45 minutes after training, then decreased as a function of time. Our work is the first to show associative learning and memory in the orange head cockroach. Findings are discussed in comparison to other invertebrate models as well as to other cockroach research."

However, there is a need to identify people with T2DM’s understanding of LCDs, their reasons for engaging in such a diet, how they sustain it and any challenges they face. This study aimed to assess the experience of adhering to a LCD within a sample of individuals with T2DM. Ten participants with T2DM were recruited using a self-selecting sampling method from an online diabetes community that promotes LCDs. Participants completed one-to-one digitally recorded semi-structured interviews, which were later transcribed verbatim and data subjected to Thematic Analysis. Five core themes and twelve subthemes were developed during the analysis: (1) Lack of professional guidance; (2) Fear of complications &amp; long-term medication use; (3) Dietary control as motivation; (4) Positive health outcomes; and (5) Social support. The findings are discussed with reference to a psychological model of behaviour, COM -B. Participants reported gaining knowledge and skills to increase their C apability to engage in LCDs, M otivation to manage diabetes outcomes influenced adherence. However, challenges were reported with the O pportunity to engage in behaviour, mainly influenced by social support.

https://openalex.org/W4292681666,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is produced endogenously by several enzymatic pathways and modulates physiological functions in mammals. Quantification of H2S in biochemical systems remains challenging because of the presence of interferents with similar reactivity, particularly thiols. Herein, we present a new quantification method based on the formation of pyrene excimers in solution. We synthesized the probe 2-(maleimido)ethyl 4-pyrenylbutanoate (MEPB) and determined that MEPB reacted with H2S in a two-step reaction to yield the thioether-linked dimer (MEPB)2S, which formed excimers upon excitation, with a broad peak of fluorescence emission centered at 480 nm. In contrast, we found that the products formed with thiols showed peaks at 378 and 398 nm. The difference in emission between the products prevented the interference. Furthermore, we showed that the excimer fluorescence signal yielded a linear response to H2S, with a limit of detection of 54 nM in a fluorometer. Our quantification method with MEPB was successfully applied to follow the reaction of H2S with glutathione disulfide and to quantify the production of H2S from cysteine by Escherichia coli. In conclusion, this method represents an addition to the toolkit of biochemists to quantify H2S specifically and sensitively in biochemical systems."

Using cell lines and primary neuron cultures, we demonstrate here that the CRY–BAR optogenetic tool evokes membrane dynamic changes associated with cellular activity. Moreover, we provide evidence that ezrin, an actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate–binding protein, acts as a relay between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton and therefore is an important mediator of switch function.

Membrane-bound architectures, including filopodia, lamellipodia, and dendritic spines in neurons, are critical for a cell’s ability to transmit and respond to extracellular cues. As such, chemists and biologists have developed numerous optogenetic and chemo-optogenetic tools to control cellular architectures via manipulation of plasma membrane dynamics (1Kichuk T.C.

In a recent work, Jones et al. (20Jones 4th, T. Liu A. Cui B. Light-inducible generation of membrane curvature in live cells with engineered BAR domain proteins.ACS Synth. Biol. 2020; 9: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) used a two-component approach (iLID/SspB) to design a light-activated switch enabling recruitment of the extended Fes–CIP4 homology BAR domain from FBP17 to the plasma membrane and a hybrid two-component approach (iLID/SspB/pdDronpa1) enabling recruitment of the inverse BAR (I-BAR) domain from IRSp53 to the plasma membrane. These switches, designed to have minimal interaction with the cell membrane in the absence of light, promoted either positive (Fes–CIP4 homology BAR; FBP17) or negative (I-BAR; IRSp53) membrane curvature in response to light activation. The MTSS1 (Missing in Metastasis 1) protein is considered the prototype of I-BAR proteins (21Li L. Liu H. Baxter S.S. Gu N. Ji M. Zhan X.

In this work, we investigated the potential of the MTSS1 I-BAR domain to serve as an actuator of membrane architecture and plasma membrane dynamics. We demonstrate that the I-BAR domain from MTSS1, in conjunction with the Cry2 photoreceptor protein (22Che D.L. Duan L. Zhang K. Cui B.

In contrast to previous approaches, we have not sought to minimize the interaction between our constructs and the plasma membrane. Instead, CRY–BAR combines the intrinsic membrane-binding affinity of the I-BAR domain (26Saarikangas J. Zhao H. Pykäläinen A. Laurinmäki P. Mattila P.K. Kinnunen P.K.J. et al.Molecular mechanisms of membrane deformation by I-BAR domain proteins.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 95-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) with the homo-oligomerizing capability of Cry2 (22Che D.L. Duan L. Zhang K. Cui B. The dual characteristics of light-induced Cryptochrome 2, homo-oligomerization and heterodimerization, for optogenetic manipulation in mammalian cells.ACS Synth. Biol. 2015; 4: 1124-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), resulting in a membrane-localized switch that induces membrane remodeling in response to blue light. We also provide insight into the mode of action of CRY–BAR by showing that ezrin, a membrane- and cytoskeletal-relay protein, is linked to the ability of CRY–BAR to induce light-activated membrane remodeling and restriction of cellular dynamics by acting as a relay between CRY–BAR activation and the actin cytoskeleton. Increased MTSS1 activity has been associated with exercise-induced enhancement of synaptic function (27Chatzi C. Zhang Y. Hendricks W.D. Chen Y. Schnell E. Goodman R.H. et al.Exercise-induced enhancement of synaptic function triggered by the inverse BAR protein, Mtss1L.Elife. 2019; 8e45920Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This prosynaptic plasticity effect of MTSS1 is attributed to the presence of an I-BAR domain within its structure. Moreover, I-BAR domains have also been shown to promote formation and stabilization of dendritic spines (Fig. 1A), leading to improved synaptic function and resilience against neurodegeneration (16Saarikangas J. Kourdougli N. Senju Y. Chazal G. Segerstråle M. Minkeviciene R. et al.MIM-induced membrane bending promotes dendritic spine initiation.Dev. Cell. 2015; 33: 644-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that control membrane expansion associated with cell morphology changes, we fused the I-BAR domain of MTSS1 with a blue light–sensing domain (Cry2PHR; Fig. 1, B and C), creating a light-activatable I-BAR protein (CRY–BAR). For this investigation, we engineered four permutations of the CRY–BAR switch: I-BAR–Cry2–mCh, I-BAR–Cry2–mCh–WH2, Cry2–mCh–I-BAR, and Cry2–mCh–MTSS1 (Fig. 1C), where I-BAR = residues 1 to 250 of MTSS1, WH2 = residues 601 to 759 of MTSS1, and MTSS1 = the intact 759 residue protein. Each construct was confirmed by Sanger and NextGen sequencing and expressed predominantly at the expected molecular weight (Fig. S1). CRY–BAR constructs were initially probed for their response to blue light in the presence of CIBN–CAAX, a membrane-localized binding partner to Cry2, in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. As anticipated, light activation of the Cry2–mCh control resulted in rapid recruitment to the plasma membrane (Figs. 2A and 3A). Light-activated recruitment to CIBN–CAAX was also observed for all the I-BAR-containing constructs (Figs. 2 and 3, B and C). Interestingly, the I-BAR domain–containing constructs I-BAR–Cry2–mCh and Cry2–mCh–I-BAR, while exhibiting light-activated recruitment to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A and C), had significant prelocalization to the plasma membrane in the dark. We attributed this to the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)–binding propensity of the I-BAR domain (readily observed in the preillumination images in Fig. 2, A and C). Because of the significant prelocalization of these constructs to the plasma membrane, we then investigated whether they might exhibit light-activated recruitment, via Cry2 homo-oligomerization, in the absence of CIBN–CAAX. These experiments revealed significant light-activated clustering/membrane recruitment (Fig. 2, B and D) in the absence of CIBN–CAAX. By contrast, Cry2–mCh–MTSS1, which also accumulated in nonlight responsive clusters, did not exhibit light-activated membrane recruitment in the absence of CIBN–CAAX (50 of 50 cells pooled from six replicates; Fig. 2D). As a result, this construct was not pursued further.Figure 3Analysis of light-activated responses of CRY–BAR constructs.

B, Cry2–mCh–I-BAR construct shows a decrease in cytosolic fluorescence intensity in both the presence and absence of plasma membrane–anchored CIB, indicative of significant homo-oligomerization at the plasma membrane.

These effects are reversible in the dark. To demonstrate this using Cry2–mCh–I-BAR, we conducted a 10 min light activation sequence, followed by a 30 min observation period in the absence of blue light. Rapid restriction of membrane dynamics was observed during the 10 min blue light activation period, with full reversibility of membrane rounding achieved after 30 min in the absence of blue light (Fig. 4 and Movie S2). We subsequently demonstrated that this effect can be selectively induced using localized illumination of the cell on a confocal microscope (Fig. 5 and Movie S3). We also investigated whether the presence of a WH2 domain (present in I-BAR–Cry2–mCh–WH2 but not in I-BAR–Cry2–mCh and Cry2–mCh–I-BAR) impacted the membrane remodeling capabilities of the optogenetic switch. Light activation of an N-terminal I-BAR domain without a C-terminal WH2 domain (I-BAR–Cry2–mCh) promoted its accumulation in numerous filopodia-like protrusions that rapidly coalesced with continued light exposure (Fig. 6A). By contrast, a construct that paired an N-terminal I-BAR domain with a C-terminal WH2-containing domain (I-BAR–Cry2–mCh–WH2) did not accumulate in filopodia-like protrusions (Fig. 6). The interaction between WH2 and monomeric actin and associated complexes (28Paunola E. Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. WH2 domain: a small, versatile adapter for actin monomers.FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 92-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), which would disfavor the preassociation of I-BAR and PIP2 required for CRY–BAR function, is likely responsible for the observed failure to accumulate at the plasma membrane. Analogously, a recent investigation of the I-BAR protein IRSp53 revealed that the I-BAR domain of IRSp53, expressed as a fusion to GFP, localized to filopodia, whereas the C terminus of IRSp53 was entirely cytosolic (29Pipathsouk A. Brunetti R.M. Town J.P. Graziano B.R. Breuer A. Pellett P.A. et al.The WAVE complex associates with sites of saddle membrane curvature.J. Cell Biol. 2021; 220e202003086Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results illustrate the modular nature of I-BAR proteins, where the N-terminal I-BAR-containing domain is required for membrane binding and localization, and the WH2 domain is required for recruitment of actin-polymerizing components that promote protrusion formation and elongation (17Saarikangas J. Mattila P.K. Varjosalo M. Bovellan M. Hakanen J. Calzada-Wack J. et al.Missing-in-metastasis MIM/MTSS1 promotes actin assembly at intercellular junctions and is required for integrity of kidney epithelia.J. Cell Sci. 2011; 124: 1245-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Only upon expression as isolated entities are the competing contributions of these domains to subcellular localization apparent. Finally, a side-by-side comparison of light activation of I-BAR–Cry2–mCh, I-BAR–Cry2–mCh–WH2, and Cry2–mCh–I-BAR demonstrated that while robust membrane recruitment is associated with light activation of Cry2–mCh–I-BAR and I-BAR–Cry2–mCh (Movie S4), Cry2–mCh–I-BAR induces a more robust effect on cell membranes, as evidenced by impact on total cell area (Fig. 4B). We attribute this to enhanced PIP2 binding and clustering capability of the I-BAR domain when in the C-terminal position of the optogenetic fusion protein.Figure 5Localized light activation of membrane remodeling with CRY–BAR.

Ezrin is one such protein that has both lipid-binding and cytoskeleton-binding domains (30Tsai F.-C. Bertin A. Bousquet H. Manzi J. Senju Y. Tsai M.-C. et al.Ezrin enrichment on curved membranes requires a specific conformation or interaction with a curvature-sensitive partner.Elife. 2018; 7e37262Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that clustering of the PIP2-bound CRY–BARs might impact dynamics by also clustering ezrin, resulting in restriction of cytoskeletal-associated phenomenon such as membrane ruffling. To investigate this, we cotransfected Cry2–mCh–I-BAR with an ezrin–GFP fusion. In the presence of light, we observed colocalization of ezrin–GFP with Cry2–mCh–I-BAR clusters at the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). This effect was pronounced in the light, and absent in the dark, indicating that CRY–BAR activation actively restricts ezrin dynamics. CRY–BAR activation accompanied by ezrin sequestration also resulted in increased cell thickness (Fig. 8), with no such effect being observed in cells expressing the Cry2–mCh control. Accompanying live-cell experiments demonstrate that, while not exclusively so, the accumulation of ezrin near the cell membrane largely followed that of CRY–BAR during light activation and exhibits a close temporal relationship with CRY–BAR activation (Fig. S2). The CRY–BAR–ezrin link implies that CRY–BAR impacts actin dynamics as well. To explore this, we performed live-cell imaging of CRY–BAR light activation in the presence of a GFP-labeled actin (Fig. 9). Actin-rich protrusions were observed to coalesce upon CRY–BAR activation (Fig. 9A) but were not generally colocalized with CRY–BAR. Interestingly, in the dark, CRY–BAR is present in filopodia tips and at lamellipodial edges and interspersed with actin (Fig. 9A). However, upon light activation, their spatial relationship changes, as rounded CRY–BAR clusters and actin-rich regions at the cell membrane become distinct (Fig. 9A, inset and Movie S5).Figure 8CRY–BAR activation and cell thickness.

Individual images of channels for mCherry (top row) and GFP (second row) in addition to an overlay (mCherry in red; GFP in green; inset in white box) showed a coalescence of actin-enriched protrusions in conjunction with CRY–BAR-induced membrane rounding after 10 min light exposure (arrow in left cell inset). Cry2–mCh–I-BAR is also enriched at the tips of actin-enriched protrusions in images before light illumination (arrows in right cell inset). After 10 min of light exposure, Cry2–mCh–I-BAR is retracted into the cell and no longer observed in protrusions (right cell inset, fourth column). Full cell image scale bar represents 10 microns.

For this, dissociated postnatal cortical neuron cultures prepared from newborn mice were transfected with Cry2–mCh–I-BAR, or cotransfected with CIBN–GFP–CAAX, according to protocol we developed for expressing optogenetic sensors in primary cultures (31Bunner W.P. Dodson R. Szatmari E.M. Hughes R.M. Transfection and activation of CofActor, a light and stress gated optogenetic tool, in primary hippocampal neuron cultures.Bio Protoc. 2021; 11e3990Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Light activation of Cry2–mCh–I-BAR, but not Cry2–mCh, resulted in elongation of neuronal processes that might indicate early stage spinogenesis (Fig. 10, Movies S6 and S7). There was no apparent benefit to activation of Cry2–mCh–I-BAR in the presence of CIBN–GFP–CAAX, providing additional evidence that activation of Cry2–mCh–I-BAR alone is sufficient for effecting membrane dynamics (Fig. 10C). Accordingly, whole-cell illumination of neurons transfected with only Cry2–mCh–I-BAR results in abundant membranous cluster formation throughout neuronal processes (Fig. S3A). Notably, oligomerization of I-BAR domain proteins is essential for their membrane-remodeling activities (32Nepal B. Sepehri A. Lazaridis T. Mechanism of negative membrane curvature generation by I-BAR domains.Structure. 2021; 29: 1440-1452.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In the context of CRY–BAR, optimal membrane remodeling is achieved via the homo-oligomerization of Cry2. By contrast, recruitment of CRY–BAR to CIBN–GFP–CAAX, while not completely detrimental to CRY–BAR activity, results in less membrane activity than activation of CRY–BAR alone (Fig. 10C). This is presumably because of a combination of reduced CRY2 homo-oligomerization in the presence of CIB, a phenomenon that has been previously described (22Che D.L. Duan L. Zhang K. Cui B. The dual characteristics of light-induced Cryptochrome 2, homo-oligomerization and heterodimerization, for optogenetic manipulation in mammalian cells.ACS Synth. Biol. 2015; 4: 1124-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and possible orientation effects of the Cry2–CIB interaction on the I-BAR domain. CIBN–GFP–CAAX has a similar membrane distribution to CRY–BAR and could interfere with CRY–BAR activity at the cell membrane (Fig. S4). Finally, using localized illumination conditions, we demonstrated that Cry2–mCh–I-BAR can be selectively activated in neuronal processes (Fig. 11 and Movie S8). Taken together, this work provides evidence that the Cry2–mCh–I-BAR molecular optogenetic tool is suitable for the targeted manipulation of cytoskeletal structures and dynamics at the plasma membrane. To our knowledge, this switch represents the first application of the I-BAR domain from MTSS1 in an optogenetic switch. In comparison to prior work in this area, CRY–BAR has the advantage of being a single-component switch, which can reduce experimental complexity and facilitate its implementation into transgenic model organisms. We note that the mechanisms of I-BAR domain proteins are not completely understood, and there are structural and mechanistic differences in the I-BAR domains across different proteins (26Saarikangas J. Zhao H. Pykäläinen A. Laurinmäki P. Mattila P.K. Kinnunen P.K.J. et al.Molecular mechanisms of membrane deformation by I-BAR domain proteins.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 95-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). As a result, one can reasonably anticipate that the incorporation of I-BAR domains from different I-BAR-containing proteins and their orthologs could produce different experimental phenotypes within the same optogenetic background. This intriguing possibility illustrates the value of pursuing multiple optogenetic variations of BAR domain proteins. Potential applications of CRY–BARs include site-directed mutagenesis of the I-BAR domain, which could provide valuable structure–function information regarding the mechanism of the I-BAR–plasma membrane interaction, and investigation of membrane deformation–dependent cell signaling pathways, such as calcium signaling (33Tu M.K. Levin J.B. Hamilton A.M. Borodinsky L.N. Calcium signaling in skeletal muscle development, maintenance and regeneration.Cell Calcium. 2016; 59: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the development of a family of optogenetic switches, collectively named CRY–BAR, that comprise a versatile platform for controlling membrane dynamics in live cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. These switches combine homo- and hetero-oligomerization of the Cry2–CIB photoreceptor system with the innate PIP2-binding affinity of the I-BAR domain. As their function varies depending on the presence of various functional elements, such as WH2-binding domains, we anticipate that a modular approach can be undertaken to adapt these optogenetic switches for other applications, including the recruitment of enzyme and receptor-activating and -inhibitory domains. Finally, CRY–BARs are suitable tools to study membrane dynamics not only in immortalized cells but also in sensitive and difficult to transfect primary cultures, such as neurons. Therefore, the CRY–BAR optogenetic switches we report here are expected to have wide applicability for investigating cellular processes associated with membrane dynamics in a variety of experimental paradigms."
