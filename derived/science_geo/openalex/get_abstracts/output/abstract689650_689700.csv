https://openalex.org/W4220886953,"Abstract The identification of the Omicron (B.1.1.529.1 or BA.1) variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Botswana in November 2021 1 immediately caused concern owing to the number of alterations in the spike glycoprotein that could lead to antibody evasion. We 2 and others 3–6 recently reported results confirming such a concern. Continuing surveillance of the evolution of Omicron has since revealed the rise in prevalence of two sublineages, BA.1 with an R346K alteration (BA.1+R346K, also known as BA.1.1) and B.1.1.529.2 (BA.2), with the latter containing 8 unique spike alterations and lacking 13 spike alterations found in BA.1. Here we extended our studies to include antigenic characterization of these new sublineages. Polyclonal sera from patients infected by wild-type SARS-CoV-2 or recipients of current mRNA vaccines showed a substantial loss in neutralizing activity against both BA.1+R346K and BA.2, with drops comparable to that already reported for BA.1 (refs. 2,3,5,6 ). These findings indicate that these three sublineages of Omicron are antigenically equidistant from the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and thus similarly threaten the efficacies of current vaccines. BA.2 also exhibited marked resistance to 17 of 19 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies tested, including S309 (sotrovimab) 7 , which had retained appreciable activity against BA.1 and BA.1+R346K (refs. 2–4,6 ). This finding shows that no authorized monoclonal antibody therapy could adequately cover all sublineages of the Omicron variant, except for the recently authorized LY-CoV1404 (bebtelovimab)."

The paper empirically examines the incentive effect and impact mechanism of digital finance on SME innovation through the two-way fixed-effects model and mediated-effects model by matching the data of China GEM-listed companies from 2011 to 2020 with the digital financial inclusion index data. The findings show that the digital development and promotion of digital finance play a significantly positive impact in helping SMEs innovate and stimulate innovation. The effect is realized by alleviating corporate financing constraints. Further, digital finance has different incentive effects on enterprises with varying rights of property nature, as well as on other regions."
https://openalex.org/W4214908457,"In low-income countries, vaccination campaigns are lagging, and evidence on vaccine acceptance, a crucial public health planning input, remains scant. This is the first study that reports willingness to take COVID-19 vaccines and its socio-demographic correlates in Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous country.The analysis is based on a nationally representative survey data of 2,317 households conducted in the informal economy in November 2020. It employs two logistic regression models where the two outcome variables are (i) a household head's willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine or not, and (ii) if yes if they would also hypothetically pay (an unspecified amount) for it or not. Predictors include age, gender, education, marital status, income category, health insurance coverage, sickness due to COVID-19, chronic illness, trust in government, prior participation in voluntary activities, urban residence.Willingness to take the vaccine was high (88%) and significantly associated with COVID-19 cases in the family, trust in government and pro-social behavior. All other predictors such as gender, education, income, health insurance, chronic illness, urban residence did not significantly predict vaccine willingness at the 5% level. Among those willing to take the vaccine, 33% also answered that they would hypothetically pay (an unspecified amount) for it, an answer that is significantly associated with trust in government, health insurance coverage and income.The results highlight both opportunities and challenges. There is little evidence of vaccine hesitancy in Ethiopia among household heads operating in the informal economy. The role played by trust in government and pro-social behavior in motivating this outcome suggests that policy makers need to consider these factors in the planning of COVID-19 vaccine campaigns in order to foster vaccine uptake. At the same time, as the willingness to hypothetically pay for a COVID-19 vaccine seems to be small, fairly-priced vaccines along with financial support are also needed to ensure further uptake of COVID-19 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4214876621,"This highly contagious zoonotic corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) spread to most parts of the world (200 countries) and created a public health emergency. Due to its novel nature and indistinctness, different sources of information and suggestions were developed to guide the individuals about its transmission and prevent its infection. Responses to the active intervention efforts have posed some relevant questions on population understanding and attitudes toward COVID-19. The present study is aims to assess the COVID-19 related knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) in a heterogeneous Indian population.501 respondents across India participated in a questionnaire-based online survey from April 2020 to May 2020. The questionnaire incorporated 56 questions about demographic characteristics and KAP dimensions. The mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods were employed to evaluate KAP dimensions. Descriptive analysis was estimated as means, SD, and proportion. The bivariate (χ2), correlation, and regression analysis were utilized for the response analysis. In addition, qualitative analysis, including content and thematic analysis were done for open-ended questions.High knowledge and positive attitude were reported in more than half of the study population, with a proportion of 58.6% and 62.1%, respectively. Education shows a significant difference in the knowledge and attitude dimensions. The good practice (50.5% of the total population) reported a significant difference in age and gender categories with the test of independence (χ2). Prevention (56.89%) in knowledge domain and risk (17.56%), information-seeking (45.51%), prevention (51.50%), and treatment-seeking (54.29%) in attitude domains recorded low proportion. KAP variables were found in association in Pearson correlation analysis. In logistic regression analysis, knowledge was the strongest predictor for the positive attitude, whereas attitude was reported as the best predictor for good practice outcome.The study presents a moderate level of covid related knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices in Indian population."
https://openalex.org/W4214822125,"Introduction Unlike previous pandemics, COVID-19 has sustained over a relatively longer period with cyclical infection waves and numerous variants. Public transport ridership has been hit particularly hard. To restore travellers’ confidence it is critical to assess their risk determinants and trade-offs. Methods To this end, we survey train travellers in the Netherlands in order to: (i) quantify the impact of trip-specific, policy-based, and pandemic-related attributes on travellers’ COVID-19 risk perceptions; and (ii) evaluate the trade-off between this risk perception and other travel attributes. Adopting the hierarchical information integration approach, in a two-stage stated preference experiment, respondents are asked to first rate how risky they perceive different travel situations to be, and then to choose between different travel options that include their own perceived risk rating as an attribute. Perceived risk ratings and choices between travel options are modelled using a linear regression and a mixed multinomial logit model, respectively. Results We find that on-board crowding and infection rates are the most important factors for risk perception. Amongst personal characteristics, the vulnerability of family and friends has the largest impact—nearly twice that of personal health risk. The bridging choice experiment reveals that while values of time have remained similar to pre-pandemic estimates, travellers are significantly more likely to choose routes with less COVID-19 risk (e.g., due to lower crowding). Respondents making longer trips by train value risk four times as much as their shorter trip counterparts. By combining the two models, we also report willingness to pay for mitigating factors: reduced crowding, mask mandates, and increased sanitization. Conclusion Since we evaluate the impact of a large number of variables on route choice behaviour, we can use the estimated models to predict behaviour under detailed pandemic scenarios. Moreover, in addition to highlighting the importance of COVID-19 risk perceptions in public transport route choices, the results from this study provide valuable information regarding the mitigating impacts of various policies on perceived risk."
https://openalex.org/W4214848820,"In folklore, Heritiera fomes (H. fomes) has been extensively used in treatment of various ailments such as diabetes, cardiac and hepatic disorders. The present study aimed to elucidate the antidiabetic actions of hot water extract of H. fomes (HWHF), including effects on insulin release from BRIN BD11 cells and isolated mouse islets as well as glucose homeostasis in high-fat-fed rats. Molecular mechanisms underlying anti-diabetic activity along with isolation of active compounds were also evaluated. Non-toxic concentrations of HWHF stimulated concentration-dependent insulin release from isolated mouse islets and clonal pancreatic β-cells. The stimulatory effect was potentiated by glucose and isobutyl methylxanthine (IBMX), persisted in presence of tolbutamide or a depolarizing concentration of KCl but was attenuated by established inhibitors of insulin release such as diazoxide, verapamil, and Ca2+ chelation. HWHF caused depolarization of the β-cell membrane and increased intracellular Ca2+. The extract also enhanced glucose uptake and insulin action in 3T3-L1 differentiated adipocytes cells and significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner starch digestion, protein glycation, DPP-IV enzyme activity, and glucose diffusion in vitro. Oral administration of HWHF (250 mg/5ml/kg b.w.) to high-fat fed rats significantly improved glucose tolerance and plasma insulin responses and it inhibited plasma DPP-IV activity. HWHF also decreased in vivo glucose absorption and intestinal disaccharidase activity while increasing gastrointestinal motility and unabsorbed sucrose transit. Compounds were isolated from HWHF with similar molecular weights to quercitrin (C21 H20 O11) ranging from 447.9 to 449.9 Da which stimulated the insulin release in vitro and improved both glucose tolerance and plasma insulin responses in mice. In conclusion, H. fomes and its water-soluble phytochemicals such as quercitrin may exert antidiabetic actions mediated through a variety of mechanisms which might be useful as dietary adjunct in the management of type 2 diabetes."

In order to study the interaction of logistics industry on the development of manufacturing industry and the development of two-industry-linkage, it first calculates the high-quality development level of logistics industry and manufacturing industry, then uses the coupling coordination model to theoretically analyze and empirically test the coupling and coordinated development level of high-quality development of logistics industry and manufacturing industry from three aspects: coupling degree, coordination degree and coupling coordination degree, and based on the perspective of integration field theory, it takes the three basic synthetic fields of logistics integrator, logistics base-nuclear and logistics connection-key as the analysis dimension, PVAR model was introduced for in-depth analysis the impact of logistics industry on manufacturing industry and the level of the two-industry-linkage. It was found that the high-quality development of China’s logistics industry and manufacturing industry is close on the whole, and the development trend is consistent, the high-quality development of them is mainly caused by the change of scale, but there is no obvious change in technical efficiency, which also provides a way for the high-quality development of the two-industry-linkage in the future. The two-industry-linkage mostly belongs to the situation of low-level mutual restriction, which has not yet reached a high level of mutual promotion, resulting in the overall coupling coordination degree basically in a state of barely coordination. The development of logistics industry and manufacturing industry need to go through certain practice and running in, when there is an error matching between the two, the logistics industry will inhibit the two-industry-linkage. When the economy develops to a certain extent, the expansion of the logistics system scale to the level of the two-industry-linkage is not necessarily beneficial, blindly exceeding the demand for logistics investment will cause a waste of resources, which is not conducive to the high-quality development of the logistics industry and the coupling and coordinated development of the two industries. In the long run, the change of the logistics basic-nuclear capacity, the logistics integrator scale and logistics connection-key level will have a positive impact on the change of green total factor productivity in manufacturing industry."
https://openalex.org/W4214901794,"Most studies of abortion access have recruited participants from abortion clinics, thereby missing people for whom barriers to care were insurmountable. Consequently, research may underestimate the nature and scope of barriers that exist. We aimed to recruit participants who had considered, but failed to obtain, an abortion using three online platforms, and to evaluate the feasibility of collecting data on their abortion-seeking experiences in a multi-modal online study. In 2018, we recruited participants for this feasibility study from Facebook, Google Ads, and Reddit for an online survey about experiences seeking abortion care in the United States; we additionally conducted in-depth interviews among a subset of survey participants. We completed descriptive analyses of survey data, and thematic analyses of interview data. Recruitment results have been previously published. For the primary outcomes of this analysis, over one month, we succeeded in capturing data on abortion-seeking experiences from 66 individuals who were not currently pregnant and reported not having obtained an abortion, nor visited an abortion facility, despite feeling that abortion could have been the best option for a recent pregnancy. A subset of survey respondents (n = 14) completed in-depth interviews. Results highlighted multiple, reinforcing barriers to abortion care, including legal restrictions such as gestational limits and waiting periods that exacerbated financial and other burdens, logistical and informational barriers, as well as barriers to abortion care less frequently reported in the literature, such as a preference for medication abortion. These findings support the use of online recruitment to identify and survey an understudied population about their abortion-seeking experiences. Further, findings contribute to a more complete understanding of the full range of barriers to abortion care that people experience in the United States, and how these barriers intersect to not just delay, but to prevent people from obtaining abortion."
https://openalex.org/W4214857365,"The assigned work was aimed to examine the capability of phytoconstituents of an aqueous seed extract of Acacia senegal (L.) Willd to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and regression of the atherosclerotic plaque. The chemical fingerprinting of the test extract was assessed by LC-MS/MS. Consequently, the analyses of in-vitro, in-vivo, and in-silico were executed by using the standard protocols. The in-vitro assessment of the test extract revealed 74.1% inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. In-vivo assessments of the test extract indicated that treated hypercholesterolemic rabbits exhibited a significant (P≤0.001) amelioration in the biomarker indices of the dyslipidaemia i.e., atherogenic index, Castelli risk index(I&II), atherogenic coefficient along with lipid profile. Subsequently, significant reductions were observed in the atherosclerotic plaque and antioxidant levels. The in-silico study of molecular docking shown interactions capabilities of the leading phytoconstituents of the test extract i.e., eicosanoic acid, linoleic acid, and flavan-3-ol with target protein of HMG-CoA reductase. The values of RSMF and potential energy of top docked complexes were show significant interactions. Accordingly, the free energy of solvation, interaction angle, radius of gyration and SASA were shown significant stabilities of top docked complex. The cumulative data of results indicate phytoconstituents of an aqueous seed extract of Acacia senegal have capabilities to inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase and improve the levels of antioxidants."
https://openalex.org/W4214879562,"The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Logistics Performance Index (LPI) on international trade of nations across each continent and worldwide. Secondary data collected on 142 countries-37 Asian, 41 European, 41 African, 3 Oceania, 14 Middle East, 11 North American and 9 South American-were analysed across the years 2007, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. Panel regression technique was applied and the random effect (RE) model was chosen based on the results of the Hausman tests and Breusch-Pagan Lagrange Multiplier test. The findings revealed that the LPI has a positive relationship with net exports globally and specifically within the continents of Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Moreover, while the GDP appears to have a significant negative impact on net exports, specifically within Asia, in contrast, countries in Oceania and the Middle East present a positive relationship. Also on the African continent, GDP has a significant negative impact on the net exports. Findings provide a holistic picture of the impact of LPI & GDP on net exports, which will assist governments in the formulation and revision of its strategies and policies to expedite the growth of exports and in turn, the economy. This study was the first of its kind to explore the impact of GDP and LPI on international trade of nations across worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W4214892246,"Caregivers of individuals with ASD can experience various practical, psychological, and social demands and need effective ways of coping to ameliorate the negative effects of caregiving. Numerous coping strategies are available, but the literature shows that caregivers can still struggle to cope, suggesting that interventions to support coping efforts could be beneficial. The MRC framework advocates the systematic development and evaluation of interventions, and this study was conducted to inform the future development of a self-help Positive Reappraisal Coping Intervention (PRCI) for these caregivers. The aim was to establish whether positive reappraisal coping strategies were used and associated with greater psychological wellbeing, prior to developing such an intervention.Caregivers of individuals with ASD (N = 112) responded to items from an existing PRCI (Lancastle, 2006; Lancastle & Boivin, 2008), by writing about aspects of caregiving that reflected the meaning of each item. They also completed questionnaires assessing resilience, caregiving burden, and positive and negative emotions.Participants provided significantly more positive responses than negative responses to PRCI items, demonstrating their use of positive reappraisal coping. Thematic analyses showed that positive responses focused on factors such as their loved one's personality and achievements, the contributions caregivers had made to this person's progress, the support received, and their own personal development. Positive reappraisal coping was associated with greater resilience, more positive and less negative emotions, and a lesser sense of caregiver burden.This modelling study suggests that positive reappraisal strategies were used by caregivers and associated with greater psychological wellbeing. The findings will inform the development of a self-help PRCI for the caregivers of those with ASD. Future studies will systematically evaluate that PRCI to determine the nature of intervention effects and mediators and moderators of effects."
https://openalex.org/W4214910488,"High yield HIV testing strategies are critical to reach epidemic control in high prevalence and low-resource settings such as East and Southern Africa. In this study, we aimed to predict the HIV status of individuals living in Angola, Burundi, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe with the highest precision and sensitivity for different policy targets and constraints based on a minimal set of socio-behavioural characteristics.We analysed the most recent Demographic and Health Survey from these 10 countries to predict individual's HIV status using four different algorithms (a penalized logistic regression, a generalized additive model, a support vector machine, and a gradient boosting trees). The algorithms were trained and validated on 80% of the data, and tested on the remaining 20%. We compared the predictions based on the F1 score, the harmonic mean of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV), and we assessed the generalization of our models by testing them against an independent left-out country. The best performing algorithm was trained on a minimal subset of variables which were identified as the most predictive, and used to 1) identify 95% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) while maximising precision and 2) identify groups of individuals by adjusting the probability threshold of being HIV positive (90% in our scenario) for achieving specific testing strategies.Overall 55,151 males and 69,626 females were included in the analysis. The gradient boosting trees algorithm performed best in predicting HIV status with a mean F1 score of 76.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 76.0%-77.6%] for males (vs [CI 67.8%-70.6%] for SVM) and 78.8% [CI 78.2%-79.4%] for females (vs [CI 73.4%-75.8%] for SVM). Among the ten most predictive variables for each sex, nine were identical: longitude, latitude and, altitude of place of residence, current age, age of most recent partner, total lifetime number of sexual partners, years lived in current place of residence, condom use during last intercourse and, wealth index. Only age at first sex for male (ranked 10th) and Rohrer's index for female (ranked 6th) were not similar for both sexes. Our large-scale scenario, which consisted in identifying 95% of all PLHIV, would have required testing 49.4% of males and 48.1% of females while achieving a precision of 15.4% for males and 22.7% for females. For the second scenario, only 4.6% of males and 6.0% of females would have had to be tested to find 55.7% of all males and 50.5% of all females living with HIV.We trained a gradient boosting trees algorithm to find 95% of PLHIV with a precision twice higher than with general population testing by using only a limited number of socio-behavioural characteristics. We also successfully identified people at high risk of infection who may be offered pre-exposure prophylaxis or voluntary medical male circumcision. These findings can inform the implementation of new high-yield HIV tests and help develop very precise strategies based on low-resource settings constraints."
https://openalex.org/W4214825164,"Measurement of oxygen consumption of cultured cells is widely used for diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases, drug testing, biotechnology, and toxicology. Fibroblasts are cultured in monolayers, but physiological measurements are carried out in suspended or attached cells. We address the question whether respiration differs in attached versus suspended cells using multiwell respirometry (Agilent Seahorse XF24) and high-resolution respirometry (Oroboros O2k), respectively. Respiration of human dermal fibroblasts measured in culture medium was baseline-corrected for residual oxygen consumption and expressed as oxygen flow per cell. No differences were observed between attached and suspended cells in ROUTINE respiration of living cells and LEAK respiration obtained after inhibition of ATP synthase by oligomycin. The electron transfer capacity was higher in the O2k than in the XF24. This could be explained by a limitation to two uncoupler titrations in the XF24 which led to an underestimation compared to multiple titration steps in the O2k. A quantitative evaluation of respiration measured via different platforms revealed that short-term suspension of fibroblasts did not affect respiratory activity and coupling control. Evaluation of results obtained by different platforms provides a test for reproducibility beyond repeatability. Repeatability and reproducibility are required for building a validated respirometric database."
https://openalex.org/W4214892337,"This study was conducted with an objective to analyze prevalence and risk factors associated with co-infection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV-positive patients with reference to their CD4+ T cell status.HIV-positive patients visiting the HIV clinic for CD4+ T cells testing at B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences were tested for Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Data regarding age, gender, mode of HIV transmission, duration of HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral therapy status, antiretroviral therapy duration, hepatitis B or C status, and CD4+ T cells count were collected via face-to-face interview, and hospital records. The data were entered in Microsoft Excel 2019 v16.0 (Microsoft, WA, USA) and statistical analysis was performed by using statistical package for social sciences, IBM SPSS® v21 (IBM, Armonk, New York).Out of 474 HIV-positive patients, HIV-HBV, HIV-HCV, and HIV-HBV-HCV co-infections were seen in 2.95% (14/474), 18.14% (86/474), and 2.53% (12/474) respectively. The primary route of infection was intra-venous drug use (IVDU) in those co-infected with HBV only (8, 57.14%), HCV only (46, 53.49%), and both HBV and HCV (8, 66.67%). HIV patients infected via IVDU were 2.40 times more likely to have HIV-HCV co-infection as compared to those infected via sexual route (AOR 2.40, 95% CI: 1.49,3.86). Similarly, HIV patients with CD4+ T cells count less than 350 cells/mm3 were more likely to have HIV-HBV-HCV co-infection as compared to those with CD4 count equal to and more than 350 cells/mm3 (AOR 13.84, 95% CI: 2.90,66.10).HIV-positive patients are at high risk of hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C co-infection. Intravenous drug use, and lower CD4+T cells count are the most important risk predictors of co-infection. All HIV-positive patients should be carefully screened with hepatitis B and hepatitis C tests during their follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W4214839781,"The concept of frailty extends beyond chronological age. Identifying frailty using a two-step approach, starting with the use of a screening tool (G8) followed by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), may be useful in guiding treatment decisions and follow-up. This study evaluated the association between G8 and CGA, and the risk of 90-day postoperative complications risk, in oncogeriatric patients.Data on geriatric patients with major oncological abdominal surgery was retrospectively collected from our hospital records between 2016 and 2019. Patients with an impaired G8 screening score, who subsequently underwent CGA geriatric screening, were included. Postoperative complications were classified using the Clavien-Dindo classification (CD), and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). The association between the individual components of the geriatric assessment tools and the 90-day postoperative complications risk was analyzed.One hundred and twelve patients, aged ≥ 70 years, operated for an intra-abdominal tumor with curative intent, were included. Seventy-six patients (67.9%) presented with an impaired G8, out of whom sixty-six (58.9%) had a CGA performed. On univariate analysis, altered nutritional status assessed by the Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form was the only variable associated with higher postoperative total complication rate (p = 0.01). Patients with an impaired G8 had significantly more postoperative complications and higher 1-year mortality rates than patients with normal G8. Fifteen patients (13.4%) had grade III-IVb complications. A CCI > 50 was recorded in 16 patients (14.3%). All-cause 90-day postoperative mortality was 10.7%.Identifying an altered preoperative nutritional status, as part of the CGA, in patients screening positive for frailty, is a potentially modifiable risk factor that can enhance preoperative management and optimize treatment decision making. G8 may be a predictive factor for postoperative complications in oncogeriatric patients."
https://openalex.org/W4214851536,"Neonatal jaundice (NNJ) is a major cause of preventable childhood mortality and long-term impairment especially in countries with significant prevalence of the inherited condition, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defect. In Ghana, routine screening of pregnant women for G6PD defect is standard care. Prevention of poor health outcomes from NNJ is contingent on population health literacy and early diagnosis. As part of a project to evaluate a screening tool for NNJ, we assessed the knowledge, attitude, and perceptions of Ghanaian mothers on NNJ at baseline.Using a cross-sectional design, mothers attending antenatal and postnatal clinics at 3 selected health facilities in 2 geographical regions of Ghana were interviewed. Data on mothers' understanding, perceptions, beliefs, and actions towards NNJ were evaluated. Chi-square test was used to determine the association between selected maternal characteristics and knowledge, attitude, and perception to NNJ.Of the 504 mothers interviewed, 428(85.4%) had heard about NNJ, 346 (68.7%) said the earliest signs are seen in the eyes, 384(76.2%) knew NNJ may be harmful and 467(92.7%) recommended seeking healthcare for the jaundiced newborn. None of the women knew about G6PD or their G6PD status following antenatal screening. Most did not know the signs/symptoms of severe NNJ. Of the 15 mothers who had had a jaundiced neonate, cost was the most perceived (8 out of 15) barrier to accessing health care. There were significant associations (p-value ≤ 0.05) between maternal age, educational level, and knowledge of NNJ.Despite the high level of awareness of NNJ, gaps still exit in the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of mothers concerning NNJ. Improving education of women about the causes, symptoms/signs, and the role of G6PD in severe NNJ is recommended. Addressing barriers to accessing healthcare for the jaundiced infant may enhance timely management of NNJ and reduce the associated complications and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4214892694,"The application of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) of MgFe and its composites with biochar of Eucalyptus camdulensis (Eb) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was explored in a batch study to mitigate toxic lead ions (Pb2+) from synthetic wastewater solutions. SEM images revealed that MgFe/LDH composites with Eb were successfully formed, while FTIR spectra confirmed the successful adsorption of Pb2+ onto the MgFe/LDH and composite adsorbents. Batch equilibrium was attained after 60 min, then the adsorption capacity gradually increased. An increase in adsorption capacity (and a 60% decrease in the percentage removal) was observed by increasing the initial Pb2+ concentration, and the highest value was 136 mg g-1 for MgFe/LDH-Eb_EDTA. A 50-60% increase in both the adsorption capacities and percent removal was seen in the pH range of 2-6. The second-order kinetic model had a nearly perfect fitting, suggesting that chemisorption was the mechanism controlling adsorption. The Langmuir isotherm model best presented the adsorption data, suggesting that the Pb2+ adsorption was monolayer, and predicted a better affinity between the adsorbent surface and absorbed Pb2+ for MgFe/LDH-Eb_EDTA in comparison to the other two adsorbents. The D-R isotherm suggested that the adsorption system was physical based on E values for all three adsorbents, while the Temkin isotherm model suggested that Pb2+ adsorption was heterogeneous. Finally, the Sips and R-P isotherms predicted that the adsorption of Pb2+ on the surface of the adsorbents was homogeneous and heterogeneous."
https://openalex.org/W4214937703,"Background and objectives Anemia remains a major public health problem worldwide. This study examined the relationship between anemia and the nutritional status of non-pregnant women aged 19–49 years in Indonesia. Methods and study design The data were derived from the 2018 Basic Health Research Data of Indonesia. We used information from 11,471 non-pregnant women aged 19–49 years. The dependent variable was anemia (hemoglobin level &lt;12 g/dL). The independent variable was women’s nutritional status, a combined indicator of body mass index (BMI) and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC). Our analysis controlled for women’s age, education, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, and the presence of communicable or non-communicable diseases. We performed logistic regression analyses. Results The prevalence of anemia in non-pregnant women aged 19–49 years was 22.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 21.4–23.3). Women with overweight and obesity were less likely to develop anemia than those with a normal BMI, regardless of their MUAC score. The highest odds for developing anemia were observed in underweight women with low MUAC scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.83, 95%CI: 2.19–3.68). Higher odds ratios were also observed in women with insufficient physical activity, despite their sufficient consumption of fruits or vegetables (aOR = 1.87, 95%CI: 1.06–3.28). However, women who had been diagnosed with a non-communicable disease had a reduced likelihood of developing anemia (aOR = 0.75, 95%CI: 0.67–0.83). Conclusions Strengthening health promotion activities to improve nutritional status and healthy behaviors, particularly a healthy diet, remains important for women in Indonesia to reduce the prevalence of anemia and improve their overall health status."
https://openalex.org/W4214826063,"Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is an antigen-triggered inflammatory condition of the esophageal lining characterized by eosinophilic infiltration. EoE is associated with significant remodeling, and although this remodeling is reversed by current treatment regimens, symptoms of EoE and associated remodeling reappear upon cessation of therapies. We hypothesized that structural remodeling of cell-cell adhesion is a key factor in the pathogenesis of EoE and that epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) was a viable molecular process to lead to this remodeling. Endoscopically obtained biopsy samples from 18 EoE and 18 control pediatric patients were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy to measure intercellular spaces (IS) between cells. Biopsy samples from all groups were analyzed for cellular levels of cell-cell adhesion proteins: E-cadherin, zonula occludens associated protein-1 (ZO-1), and N-cadherin. We also analyzed for cellular levels and localization two of transcription factors, Twist1 and β-catenin, that are associated with promoting EMT. The IS was significantly increased in the EoE group compared to the control. We observed a significant decrease in E-cadherin and ZO-1 levels and a concomitant increase in N-cadherin levels in EoE samples compared to control. Further, while there was no significant change in cellular levels of β-catenin, we observed an altered localization of the protein from the cell membrane in control tissue to a nuclear/perinuclear localization in EoE. We observed higher levels of the transcription factor Twist1 in the EoE group compared to normal which was localized mainly at the nucleus. Our results suggest that the integrity of normally sealed esophageal epithelia is compromised in the EoE patients compared to control subjects, and this is due to alterations in the expression of cell adhesion molecules at the esophageal epithelium. Our data also suggest that EMT, potentially regulated by transcription factors β-catenin and Twist1, may be responsible for the molecular alteration which leads to the remodeling of esophageal epithelia in EoE."
https://openalex.org/W4214849871,"Apoptotic cell death within the brain represents a significant contributing factor to impaired post-traumatic tissue function and poor clinical outcome after traumatic brain injury. After irradiation with light in the wavelength range of 600-1200 nm (photobiomodulation), previous investigations have reported a reduction in apoptosis in various tissues. This study investigates the effect of 660 nm photobiomodulation on organotypic slice cultured hippocampal tissue of rats, examining the effect on apoptotic cell loss. Tissue optical Raman spectroscopic changes were evaluated. A significantly higher proportion of apoptotic cells 62.8±12.2% vs 48.6±13.7% (P<0.0001) per region were observed in the control group compared with the photobiomodulation group. After photobiomodulation, Raman spectroscopic observations demonstrated 1440/1660 cm-1 spectral shift. Photobiomodulation has the potential for therapeutic utility, reducing cell loss to apoptosis in injured neurological tissue, as demonstrated in this in vitro model. A clear Raman spectroscopic signal was observed after apparent optimal irradiation, potentially integrable into therapeutic light delivery apparatus for real-time dose metering."
https://openalex.org/W4214876200,"Background Apraxia and action disorganization syndrome (AADS) after stroke can disrupt activities of daily living (ADL). Occupational therapy has been effective in improving ADL performance, however, inclusion of multiple tasks means it is unclear which therapy elements contribute to improvement. We evaluated the efficacy of a task model approach to ADL rehabilitation, comparing training in making a cup of tea with a stepping training control condition. Methods Of the 29 stroke survivors with AADS who participated in this cross-over randomized controlled feasibility trial, 25 were included in analysis [44% females; mean(SD) age = 71.1(7.8) years; years post-stroke = 4.6(3.3)]. Participants attended five 1-hour weekly tea making training sessions in which progress was monitored and feedback given using a computer-based system which implemented a Markov Decision Process (MDP) task model. In a control condition, participants received five 1-hour weekly stepping sessions. Results Compared to stepping training, tea making training reduced errors across 4 different tea types. The time taken to make a cup of tea was reduced so the improvement in accuracy was not due to a speed-accuracy trade-off. No improvement linked to tea making training was evident in a complex tea preparation task (making two different cups of tea simultaneously), indicating a lack of generalisation in the training. Conclusions The clearly specified but flexible training protocol, together with information on the distribution of errors, provide pointers for further refinement of task model approaches to ADL rehabilitation. It is recommended that the approach be tested under errorless learning conditions with more impaired patients in future research.

https://openalex.org/W4214893444,"Background Hantaviruses (HVs) are major zoonotic pathogens in China that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) posing a major threat to people’s health. Hainan Province, an island located in Southeast China, is an ideal region for sea ports. The unique tropical monsoon climate in Hainan provides sufficient living conditions for rodents, which help spread HVs and other rodent-borne diseases. In the routine monitoring of hantavirus, there was no evidence that rodents in Hainan carried hantavirus. No patients infected with hantavirus were found in the past. However, the surveillance of HVs-carrying rodents covering the whole territory of Hainan has not stopped. Methodology/principal findings For the monitoring of the prevalence of HVs in rodents and the search for theoretical reference for rodent control and HFRS prevention, a total of 60 rodents from 6 monitoring spots were trapped around main ports in Hainan between 2016 and 2019. HV positive samples were identified by a specific kit and sequenced. The data indicated that seven rodents ( Rattus norvegicus ) were positive for hantavirus with a positivity rate of 11.67%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the two complete sequence strains HN1 and HN4 in this research were highly similar to the sequence strains GZRn36 and GZRn148 isolated in Guangdong Province, and they located in the same phylogenetic tree branch which belongs to S2 subtype. Although the two partial sequences HT1 and HT2 isolated in Xisha Islands belong to S2 subtype according to the phylogenetic tree of L segment, they showed a great nucleotide difference with HN1 and HN4. We also found 13 amino acid variations compared with SEOV 80–39 and 6 amino acid mutations related to epitope, and the variations may reduce the effectiveness of the current HFRS vaccines used in humans. Conclusions/significance The study indicated HVs carried by rodents found in Hainan Province may be transmitted from Guangdong Province through trading ports and carriage of goods by sea. So it is of great significance to strengthen the surveillance of rodents in port areas especially capture and eliminate rodents on ship. Timely elimination of host animals of hantavirus in port areas is necessary to prevent an outbreak of HVs disease."
https://openalex.org/W4214910828,"This research aimed to qualitatively explore whether the determinants of handwashing behaviour change according to the duration of displacement or the type of setting that people are displaced to. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study in three different post-conflict settings in Northern Iraq-a long-term displacement camp, a short-term displacement camp, and villages where people were returning to post the conflict. We identified 33 determinants of handwashing in these settings and, of these, 21 appeared to be altered by the conflict and displacement. Determinants of handwashing behaviour in the post-conflict period were predominantly explained by disruptions to the physical, psychological, social and economic circumstances of displaced populations. Future hygiene programmes in post-conflict displacement settings should adopt a holistic way of assessing determinants and design programmes which promote agency, build on adaptive norms, create an enabling environment and which are integrated with other aspects of humanitarian response."
https://openalex.org/W4214915124,"Parsers are used in different software development scenarios such as compiler construction, data format processing, machine-level translation, and natural language processing. Due to the widespread usage of parsers, there exist different tools aimed at automizing their generation. Two of the most common parser generation tools are the classic Lex/Yacc and ANTLR. Even though ANTLR provides more advanced features, Lex/Yacc is still the preferred choice in many university courses. There exist different qualitative comparisons of the features provided by both approaches, but no study evaluates empirical features such as language implementor productivity and tool simplicity, intuitiveness, and maintainability. In this article, we present such an empirical study by conducting an experiment with undergraduate students of a Software Engineering degree. Two random groups of students implement the same language using a different parser generator, and we statistically compare their performance with different measures. Under the context of the academic study conducted, ANTLR has shown significant differences for most of the empirical features measured."
https://openalex.org/W4214937086,"Common geometrical layouts could potentially be bottlenecks, particularly during emergency and high density situations. When pedestrians are interacting with such complex geometrical settings, the congestion effect might not be uniform over the bottleneck area. This study uses the trajectory data collected through a controlled laboratory experiment to explore the spatial variation of speeds when a group of people navigates through bends. Four turning angles, i.e., 45°, 90°, 135° and 180°, with a straight corridor and two speed levels, i.e., normal speed walking and slow running (jogging), were considered in these experiments. Results explained that the speeds are significantly different over the space within the bend for all angles (except 0°) under both speed levels. In particular, average walking speeds are significantly lower near the inner corner of the bend as compared to the outer corner. Further, such speed variations are magnified when the angle of the bend and desired speed increase. These outcomes indicate that even smaller turning angles, e.g., 45° could create bottlenecks near the inner corner of the bend, particularly when the walking speeds are high. The findings of this study could be useful in understanding the congestion and bottleneck effects associated with complex geometrical settings, and calibrating microscopic simulation tools to accurately reproduce such effects."
https://openalex.org/W4214951024,"Internet Addiction (IA) is often shown to be associated with health issues, but no study explicitly examined a possible gradient in the association between different levels of IA and health. This study aimed to examine if the levels of IA had a graded relationship with poor sleep quality, psychological distress, and self-rated health among university students in Bangladesh.In this cross-sectional study, a sample of 625 students from six universities/colleges responded to an online survey that contained measures of internet addiction test (IAT), general health questionnaire (GHQ-12), sleep quality, and self-rated health. Modified Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate the adjusted risk ratios (RR) and confidence intervals (CI) of the associations between IA and health outcomes.The IA levels were associated with each of the three health outcomes in a linear fashion. Compared to the lowest IA quintile, the highest quintile remained associated with an increased risk of poor-quality sleeping (RR: 1.77; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.48), psychological distress (RR: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.55, 2.82), and worse self-rated health (RR: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.96) after adjusting for socio-demographic covariates. There were also dose-response associations between IAT z-scores and health outcomes. The association between IAT z-scores and psychological distress was significantly stronger in males compared to females (p-value for interaction<0.05).The study found strong gradients between levels of addiction to internet and health outcomes, suggesting that increased health risks may exist even at lower levels of internet addiction. The findings highlight the need for departure of current research from a focus on the classic dichotomy of problematic versus not problematic internet use and a move toward recognizing the potential hierarchical effects of IA on health."
https://openalex.org/W4220980803,"Objective We assessed trends and identified individual- and county-level factors associated with individual linkage to HIV care in Tennessee (TN). Methods TN residents diagnosed with HIV from 2012–2016 were included in the analysis (n = 3,751). Individuals were assigned county-level factors based on county of residence at the time of diagnosis. Linkage was defined by the first CD4 or HIV RNA test date after HIV diagnosis. We used modified Poisson regression to estimate probability of 30-day linkage to care at the individual-level and the contribution of individual and county-level factors to this outcome. Results Both MSM (aRR 1.23, 95%CI 0.98–1.55) and women who reported heterosexual sex risk factors (aRR 1.39, 95%CI 1.18–1.65) were more likely to link to care within 30-days than heterosexual males. Non-Hispanic Black individuals had poorer linkage than White individuals (aRR 0.77, 95%CI 0.71–0.83). County-level mentally unhealthy days were negatively associated with linkage (aRR 0.63, 95%CI: 0.40–0.99). Conclusions Racial disparities in linkage to care persist at both individual and county levels, even when adjusting for county-level social determinants of health. These findings suggest a need for structural interventions to address both structural racism and mental health needs to improve linkage to care and minimize racial disparities in HIV outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4214830391,"Background Unintended pregnancy leads to unsafe abortion, which is one of the commonest causes of maternal deaths in developing countries including Ghana. Lots of unintended pregnancies can be avoided using emergency contraceptives (EC). Emergency contraceptives are mostly used after unprotected sexual intercourse and have a ninety-nine percent chance of preventing unintended pregnancy when taken correctly. However, unlike other modern contraceptives such as condoms, emergency contraceptives cannot prevent sexually transmitted infections. Objectives This study aimed at assessing the factors influencing the use of emergency contraceptives among reproductive-age women in the Kwadaso Municipality, Ghana. Methods A community-based descriptive cross-sectional study design was conducted in three sub-municipalities of the Kwadaso Municipality. A multistage sampling method was used to select 312 women in their reproductive age within households. A simple random sampling method was first used to select the sub-municipalities (Kwadaso Central, Asuoyeboah, and Agric-Nzema). Participants were selected from households through a systematic sampling procedure and responses were solicited from women who consented to participate in the study. The selection was strictly dependent on the number of eligible women in a household, that is, in an event where more than one woman was found in a household, a simple random sampling method was used to select only one woman from that household. STATA 15.0 was used to analyse the data. Binary logistic regression was used to find the adjusted estimates and associations between EC use and the exposure variables. P-values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant at 95% Confidence Interval (CI). Results The findings showed that 79.67% of the women had ever used EC. Amongst them, 59.83% used EC following unexpected unprotected sex, and 24.69% used EC following failed coitus interruptus. Women’s attitude towards EC (AOR = 8.52, p&lt;0 . 001 ), religion (AOR = 4.56, p = 0 . 004 ), and monthly income (AOR = 0.29, p = 0 . 030 ) were found to have significant influence on their use of EC. Conclusion The level of EC use among the women was high. Women’s attitude towards EC, religion, and monthly income were the major factors influencing the use of EC. Thus, strategies to promote EC use should emphasize on addressing the attitude of women towards EC through sex education in schools, various religious institutions, and the community at large with the services of health authorities and support from governmental and non-governmental organizations whose focus is to address the need for reproductive health services in order to reduce the misconception regarding the use of EC."
https://openalex.org/W4214837735,"The aim of this study was to provide a sensitive model animal for studying hyperuricemia. Male uricase-deficient rats, named Kunming-DY rats, were raised for 130 days, or orally administered with purines and other chemicals. Serum uric acid (SUA) in the animals was assayed, and the UA level in their organs and their 24-h excretion was determined. Genes in the jejunum, ileum, kidney and liver related to UA synthesis and transportation were detected by quantitative RNA sequencing. Uricase-deficient rats have a high level of SUA and are sensitive to xanthine, adenosine, inosine, allopurinol, and alcohol. Besides, the high level of SUA in male uricase-deficient rats was stable, much higher than that in wild-type rats but similar to that in men. The distribution pattern of UA in uricase-deficient rats’ organs was different from that in wild-type rats. The kidney, liver, and small intestine were the top three organs where UA distributed, but the UA in the small intestine, colon, lung, thymus, and brain was less affected by uricase deficiency, indicating that these organs are constitutive distribution organs in UA. The 24-h UA excreted by a uricase-deficient rat was about five times higher than that excreted by a wild-type rat. However, the 24-h UA excreted through feces was not significantly changed. Both the urine volume and UA in uricase-deficient rats significantly increased, and more than 90% of UA was excreted via urine. The expression of xanthine dehydrogenase was not upregulated. Some genes of transporter associated with uric acid excretion in the kidney were significantly regulated, though not sufficient to explain the increase in SUA. In conclusion, male uricase-deficient rats’ UA metabolism is similar to that of men. The elevation of SUA in uricase-deficient rats is caused by uricase deficiency, and uricase-deficient rats are a sensitive model for studying hyperuricemia."
https://openalex.org/W4214848642,"Introduction Dental caries is a major public health problem. In Ethiopia, prevention and treatment of oral health-related illness had given little attention and there is limited data on the extent and factors associated with oral health-related illnesses and oral care practices. Objective This study was aimed to investigate the prevalence of dental caries and associated factors among patients visiting Shashamane Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (SCSH). Methods A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 288 patients who visited SCSH dental clinic from March 1, 2021, to April 15, 2021. A questionnaire was employed to collect the background characteristics of the participants. Dental caries was confirmed as per World Health Organization guidelines. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 24. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine predictors of dental caries. A p -value less than 0.05 was taken as a cut point to determine a significant association. Results The overall prevalence of dental caries was 64.6% with 95% CI (58.8‒70.1). The mean of Decayed, Missing, and Filled Teeth was 1.33. Dental caries was significantly higher among respondents who did not brush their teeth (AOR = 3.589, 95% CI:1.756‒7.334), who consumed sugary food (AOR = 3.650, 95% CI: 1.747‒7.628), those with monthly a income of less than 5000.00 Ethiopian Birr (AOR = 2.452, 95% CI (1.193‒5.042), and those who had poor oral hygiene status (AOR = 1.826, 95% CI: 0.901‒3.700). Conclusions This study revealed a high prevalence of dental caries among patients visiting the dental clinic. Tooth brushing habits, consumption of sugary food, and poor oral hygiene were significantly associated with dental caries."
https://openalex.org/W4214849210,"In 2006, Japan introduced the Revised Medical Care Act aimed to shift end-of-life care from hospitals to communities. For patients and families, dying in hospital can be highly distressing. Persons with dementia are especially susceptible to negative hospital-related outcomes. This study aims to evaluate whether the Revised Medical Care Act is associated with a decrease in the proportion of hospital deaths for older adults and persons with dementia over a 20-year period covering the reform.This is a population-level, repeated cross-sectional study using mortality data from Vital Statistics Japan. Participants were Japanese older adults 65 years or older with and without dementia who died between 1996 and 2016. The policy intervention was the 2006 Revised Medical Care Act that increased community care infrastructure. The primary outcome was location of death in hospital, nursing home, home, or elsewhere. The trend in the proportion of location of death, before and after the reforms was estimated using an interrupted time-series analysis. All analyses were adjusted for sex and seasonality. Of the 19,307,104 older adult decedents, 216,442 had dementia identified on their death certificate. Death in nursing home (1.10, 95% CI 1.10-1.10), home (1.08, 95% CI 1.08-1.08), and elsewhere (1.07, 95% CI 1.07-1.07) increased over time compared to hospital deaths for the total population after reform implementation. Nursing home (1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05) and home death (1.11, 95% CI 1.10-1.12) increased after reform implementation for persons with dementia.This study provides evidence that the 2006 Revised Medical Care Act was associated with decreased older adults dying in hospital regardless of dementia status; however, hospital continues as the primary location of death."

Substituting the channel material of a field-effect transistors (FET) with silicene is foreseen as a viable approach for future transistor applications. In this study, we proposed a SPICE-compatible model for p-type (Aluminium) uniformly doped silicene FET for digital switching applications. The performance of the proposed device is benchmarked with various low-dimensional FETs in terms of their on-to-off current ratio, subthreshold swing and drain-induced barrier lowering. The results show that the proposed p-type silicene FET is comparable to most of the selected low-dimensional FET models. With its decent performance, the proposed SPICE-compatible model should be extended to the circuit-level simulation and beyond in future work."
https://openalex.org/W4214861217,"Background Reviewing the epidemiological profile of medication errors (MEs) reported by African countries and the systems put in place to report such errors is crucial because reporting plays an important role in improving patient safety. The objectives of this study were to characterize the profile of spontaneously reported MEs submitted by African countries to VigiBase; the World Health Organization (WHO) global database of individual case safety reports, describe systems in place for reporting these errors, and explore the challenges and facilitators for spontaneous reporting and understand the potential role of patients. Methods In the present study, we used, a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design involving a quantitative review of ME reports over a 21-year period (1997–2018) and qualitative interviews with employees from African countries that are members of the WHO Program for International Drug Monitoring (WHO PIDM). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize key variables of interest. Results A total of 4,205 ME reports were submitted by African countries to VigiBase representing 0.4% of all reports in the database. Only 15 countries out of the 37 WHO PIDM members from Africa contributed ME to reports, with 99% (3,874) of them reports originating from Egypt, Morocco, and South Africa. The reasons given for low reporting of MEs were weak healthcare and pharmacovigilance systems, lack of staff capacity at the national centers, illiteracy, language difficulties, and socio-cultural and religious beliefs. Some facilitators suggested by the participants to promote reporting included proactive engagement of patients regarding issues relating to MEs, leveraging on increased technology, benchmarking and mentoring by more experienced national centers. Sixteen of the twenty countries interviewed had systems for reporting MEs integrated into adverse drug reaction reporting with minimal patient involvement in seven of these countries. Patients were not involved in directly reporting MEs in the remaining 13 countries. Conclusions MEs are rarely reported through pharmacovigilance systems in African countries with limited patient involvement. The systems are influenced by multifactorial issues some of which are not directly related to healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W4214884583,"Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is a disease where progressive visual impairment occurs by the thickening of the Descemet's membrane and the gradual degeneration and loss of corneal endothelial cells. This study aimed to investigate the key changes in gene expression associated with FECD and explore potential biomarkers and new therapeutic strategies for FECD. To explore the potential therapeutic targets of FECD, we downloaded the gene expression dataset GSE171830 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 303 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the limma package. The enriched Gene Ontology (GO) annotations and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways of DEGs mostly included the extracellular matrix organization, collagen-containing extracellular matrix, and the structural constituents of the extracellular matrix. Fifteen hub genes from the most significant module were ascertained by Cytoscape. Both collagen-containing extracellular matrix and extracellular matrix hit to ANXA1, VCAN, GPC3, TNC, IGFBP7, MATN3, and SPARCL1 genes in the GO cellular components. Among these genes, the expression of SPARCL1 was down-regulated in the FECD samples, whereas the expression of GPC3, MATN3, IGFBP7, TNC, VCAN, and ANXA1 was up-regulated in the FECD samples. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) plots showed that among the 20,937 genes, SPARCL1 played an important role in three pathways, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the TGF-beta signaling pathway, and antigen processing and presentation. The top three pathways enriched by the GPC3, MATN3, IGFBP7, TNC, VCAN, and ANXA1 genes were those for cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, TGF-beta signaling, and RIG-I-like receptor signaling. In conclusion, the DEGs identified here might assist clinicians in understanding the pathogenesis of FECD. Furthermore, these identified biomarkers might serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of FECD."
https://openalex.org/W4214907193,"Mixed Gaussian and Random-valued impulse noise (RVIN) removal is still a big challenge in the field of image denoising. Existing denoising algorithms have defects in denoising performance and computational complexity. Based on the improved “detecting then filtering” strategy and the idea of inpainting, this paper proposes an efficient method to remove mixed Gaussian and RVIN. The proposed algorithm contains two phases: noise classification and noise removal. The noise classifier is based on Adaptive center-weighted median filter (ACWMF), three-sigma rule and extreme value processing. Different from the traditional “detecting then filtering” strategy, a preliminary RVIN removal step is added to the noise removal phase, which leads to three steps in this phase: preliminary RVIN removal, Gaussian noise removal and final RVIN removal. Firstly, RVIN is processed to obtain a noisy image approximately corrupted by Gaussian noise only. Subsequently, Gaussian noise is re-estimated and then denoised by Block Matching and 3D filtering method (BM3D). At last, the idea of inpainting is introduced to further remove RVIN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms quantitatively and visually to the state-of-the-art mixed Gaussian and RVIN removal methods. In addition, it greatly shortens the computation time."
https://openalex.org/W4214939640,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) in deceased donors is not associated with graft failure (GF). We hypothesize that hemodynamic AKI (hAKI) comprises the majority of donor AKI and may explain this lack of association.In this ancillary analysis of the Deceased Donor Study, 428 donors with available charts were selected to identify those with and without AKI. AKI cases were classified as hAKI, intrinsic (iAKI), or mixed (mAKI) based on majority adjudication by three nephrologists. We evaluated the associations between AKI phenotypes and delayed graft function (DGF), 1-year eGFR and GF. We also evaluated differences in urine biomarkers among AKI phenotypes.Of the 291 (68%) donors with AKI, 106 (36%) were adjudicated as hAKI, 84 (29%) as iAKI and 101 (35%) as mAKI. Of the 856 potential kidneys, 669 were transplanted with 32% developing DGF and 5% experiencing GF. Median 1-year eGFR was 53 (IQR: 41-70) ml/min/1.73m2. Compared to non-AKI, donors with iAKI had higher odds DGF [aOR (95%CI); 4.83 (2.29, 10.22)] and had lower 1-year eGFR [adjusted B coefficient (95% CI): -11 (-19, -3) mL/min/1.73 m2]. hAKI and mAKI were not associated with DGF or 1-year eGFR. Rates of GF were not different among AKI phenotypes and non-AKI. Urine biomarkers such as NGAL, LFABP, MCP-1, YKL-40, cystatin-C and albumin were higher in iAKI.iAKI was associated with higher DGF and lower 1-year eGFR but not with GF. Clinically phenotyped donor AKI is biologically different based on biomarkers and may help inform decisions regarding organ utilization."
https://openalex.org/W4214814302,"Topic models extract latent concepts from texts in the form of topics. Lifelong topic models extend topic models by learning topics continuously based on accumulated knowledge from the past which is updated continuously as new information becomes available. Hierarchical topic modeling extends topic modeling by extracting topics and organizing them into a hierarchical structure. In this study, we combine the two and introduce hierarchical lifelong topic models. Hierarchical lifelong topic models not only allow to examine the topics at different levels of granularity but also allows to continuously adjust the granularity of the topics as more information becomes available. A fundamental issue in hierarchical lifelong topic modeling is the extraction of rules that are used to preserve the hierarchical structural information among the rules and will continuously update based on new information. To address this issue, we introduce a network communities based rule mining approach for hierarchical lifelong topic models (NHLTM). The proposed approach extracts hierarchical structural information among the rules by representing textual documents as graphs and analyzing the underlying communities in the graph. Experimental results indicate improvement of the hierarchical topic structures in terms of topic coherence that increases from general to specific topics."

This study examined effectiveness of a personalised video story and text-based message on GP and health professional visitations and health behaviours, of individuals assessed as 'high risk' following completion of the online Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool (AUSDRISK).A Randomised Controlled Trial (conducted between October 2018 and April 2019) included 477 participants with a high score (≥12). The control group received a text-based message (TM) and the intervention group received both the text-based message and a personalised video story (TM+VS) encouraging them to take follow-up action. Participants reported follow-up actions (one- and three months), and physical activity (PA), dietary behaviours and body weight (baseline, one and three months). Generalized Linear Mixed Models and chi-squared tests were used to test differences in outcomes between groups over time.The intervention was not more effective for the TM+VS group compared to the TM only group (p-values>0.05 for all outcomes). More participants in the TM only group (49.8% compared to 40.0% in the VS+TM group) visited either a GP or health professional (p = 0.18). During the 3-month follow-up: 44.9% of all participants visited a GP (36.7%) and/or other health professional (31.0%). Significant improvements were found between baseline and three months, in both groups for weekly physical activity, daily fruit and vegetable intake and weight status.Messages provided with online diabetes risk assessment tools to those with high-risk, positively influence GP and health professional visitations and promote short-term improvements in health behaviours that may contribute to an overall reduction in the development of type 2 diabetes.Australia New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry; ACTRN12619000809134."
https://openalex.org/W4214835856,"The close relationship between histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) and immunity has attracted attention. We constructed an immune signature for HDAC9, a vital epigenetic modification, to predict the survival status and treatment benefits in bladder cancer (BC).An exhaustive analysis of HDAC9 and immunology via the tumor and immune system interaction database (TISIDB) was performed, and an immune prognostic risk signature was developed based on genes enriched in the top five immune-related pathways under high HDAC9 status. Comprehensive analysis of survival curves and Cox regression were used to estimate the effectiveness of the risk signature. The relationship between immunological characteristics and the risk score was evaluated, and the mechanisms were also explored.In the TISIDB, HDAC9 was closely related to various immunological characteristics. The risk signature was obtained based on genes related to prognosis enriched in the top five immune-related pathways under high HDAC9 status. The survival rate of the high-risk BC patients was poor. The risk score was closely related to multiple immunological characteristics, drug sensitivity, immunotherapy benefits and biofunctions.An immune-related prognostic signature established for HDAC9 expression status could independently predict the prognosis of BC patients. The use of this signature could help clinicians make personalized treatment decisions."

To provide more transport services, it is necessary to add as many trains as possible in a section to increase capacity. To solve this problem, a compressed multilayer space-time network model is constructed with the maximum number of trains that can be scheduled in the train timetable as the objective. The combination of the train stop plan and speed level is represented by the layer of network where the train is located, and constraints such as train selection, train safety, train overtake and cross-line trains are considered. A method based on timing-cycle iterative optimization is designed to decompose the original problem into multiple subproblems, and the solving order of the subproblems is determined by a heuristic greedy rule. Taking the Beijing-Jinan section of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway as an example, the maximum number of trains was increased by 12.5% compared with the timetable before optimization. The saturated timetables provide detailed schedules, which helps decision-makers better adjust the timetable to run more trains."
https://openalex.org/W4214881256,"In Ethiopia, data on the burden and determinants of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the general population is limited. This community-based study was conducted to assess the burden and associated factors of CKD among adults in Southwest Ethiopia. The study was conducted from August 23, 2018-October 16, 2018. Study participants were selected using a random sampling method. A structured questionnaire was used to collect relevant data. Blood pressure and anthropometric indices were measured following standard procedures. About 5 ml of urine sample was collected and the dipstick test was performed immediately. A blood sample of 3-5ml was collected for serum creatinine and blood glucose level determination. The three commonest estimators of glomerular filtration rate and the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative were used to define and stage CKD. Data were analyzed using SPSS 21. Multivariable logistic regression was employed and p-value &lt;0.05 was used to indicate statistically significant results. A total of 326 participants with a mean age of 39.9(SD±11.2) years were enrolled in the study. The proportions of female participants (59.8%) were relatively higher than male participants (40.2%). The mean eGFR using CKD-EPI, CG and MDRD was 124.34 (SD±23.8) mL/min/1.73m 2 , 110.67(SD±33.0) mL/min/1.73m 2 and 131.29 (SD±32.5) mL/min/1.73m 2 respectively. The prevalence of CKD was 7.4% using CKD-EPI &amp; MDRD and 8% using CG. Similar finding using CKD-EPI &amp; MDRD may indicate that either CKD-EPI or MDRD can be used to estimate GFR in this study area. In the age and sex-adjusted logistic regression model, hypertension was significantly associated with CKD using CKD-EPI &amp; MDRD and age ≥40 years old was significantly associated with CKD using CG. Behavioral characteristics and other traditional risk factors were not significantly associated with CKD in the current study. The prevalence of CKD was high in the study area. Only hypertension and age ≥40 years old were significantly associated with CKD. More of the increased prevalence of CKD in the current study remained unexplained and deserves further study."
https://openalex.org/W4214890728,"Objectives Continuity of care (COC) is considered an important determinant of medication adherence based on measures such as the usual provider continuity index (UPCI) that are derived exclusively from physician visit claims. This study aimed to: a) determine if high UPCI values predict physicians who deliver different clinical services; and b) compare UPCI with an integrated COC measure capturing physician visits, prescribing, and a complete medical examination in a multivariable model of patients receiving statin medications. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of new statin users between 2012 and 2017 in Saskatchewan, Canada. We calculated sensitivity/specificity of a high UPCI value for predicting physicians who were prescribers of statins and/or providers of complete medical examinations. Next, we used logistic regression models to test two measures of COC (high UPCI value or an integrated COC measure) on the outcome of optimal statin adherence (proportion of days covered ≥80%). The DeLong test was used to compare predictive performance of the two models. Results Among 55,144 new statin users, a high UPCI was neither a sensitive or specific marker of physicians who prescribed statins or performed a complete medical examination. The integrated COC measure had a stronger association with optimal adherence [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50 to 1.63] than UPCI (adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.28), and improved predictive performance of the adherence model. Conclusion The number of physician visits alone appears to be insufficient to represent COC. An integrated measure improves predictive performance for optimal medication adherence in patients initiating statins."
https://openalex.org/W4214897644,"As high blood pressure (HBP) is often considered an adult disease in Africa, studies on and services for HBP focus on adults to the near-exclusion of adolescents. The dearth of information about the burden of HBP does not favour much attention being paid to it. We, therefore, prepared this protocol to estimate the prevalence and awareness of HBP in adolescents in Africa through a systematic review and meta-analysis.We will search several major databases for published and unpublished articles on population-based studies on adolescents living in Africa, aged 10-19 years produced from the year 2000 to date. The included articles will be those that define HBP according to international guidelines using the blood pressure cut-offs of the 95th percentile for age, sex and height or of 130/90 mmHg, depending on the age of the subjects. The study selection as well as the evaluation of the quality of the included articles will be done independently by two reviewers, in line with best practices. We will pool together the prevalence across studies using random effects analysis and assess heterogeneity using meta-regression analysis and sub-group analysis. Sensitivity analysis using a leave-one-out analysis and an evaluation of reporting bias will also be performed. Reporting of our findings will conform to the recommended reporting guidelines.The findings from our comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis will provide an up-to-date information on the prevalence of HBP and its awareness among adolescents in Africa and its sub-regions. They could be used to advocate for increased priority to life course approach to the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.PROSPERO CRD42020197946."
https://openalex.org/W4214926644,"The timing of science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy initiatives is critical to the outcomes that they produce. This study examines the advantages and disadvantages of enacting STI policy investments early in a nascent domain of activity. Building on work across multiple disciplines, we propose a framework to better understand the temporal dynamics of STI policy. An examination of data on nanotechnology STI policy around the world shows that the timing and funding size is related to entrepreneurship and innovation in different ways. The findings reveal that countries that started funding national STI programs in nanotechnology later had a lower proportion of the total nanotechnology firms, patents, and publications in the world, which suggests some first-mover advantages to STI policy. However, this is only part of the story. Countries that had large programs after the technology had gained legitimacy had the opposite situation such that there was a higher proportion of the total nanotechnology firms, patents, and publication in the world and more nanotechnology-related patents per capita and firms relative to other firms in the country explicating some of the complexity of policy timing. We discuss how temporal considerations influence both the theory and practice of building systems of innovation."
https://openalex.org/W4221089829,"Thymidine Kinase 1 (TK1) is primarily known as a cancer biomarker with good prognostic capabilities for both hematological and solid malignancies. However, recent studies targeting TK1 at protein and mRNA levels have shown that TK1 may be useful as a therapeutic target. In order to examine the use of TK1 as a therapeutic target, it is necessary to develop therapeutics specific for it. Single domain antibodies (sdAbs), represent an exciting approach for the development of immunotherapeutics due to their cost-effective production and higher tumor penetration than conventional antibodies. In this study, we isolated sdAb fragments specific to human TK1 from a human sdAb library. A total of 400 sdAbs were screened through 5 rounds of selection by monoclonal phage ELISA. The most sensitive sdAb fragments were selected as candidates for preclinical testing. The sdAb fragments showed specificity for human TK1 in phage ELISA, Western blot analysis and had an estimated limit of detection of 3.9 ng/ml for the antibody fragments 4-H-TK1_A1 and 4-H-TK1_D1. The antibody fragments were successfully expressed and used for detection of membrane associated TK1 (mTK1) through flow cytometry on cancer cells [lung (~95%), colon (~87%), breast (~53%)] and healthy human mononuclear cells (MNC). The most sensitive antibody fragments, 4-H-TK1_A1 and 4-H-TK1_D1 were fused to an engineered IgG1 Fc fragment. When added to cancer cells expressing mTK1 co-cultured with human MNCs, the anti-TK1-sdAb-IgG1_A1 and D1 were able to elicit a significant antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) response against lung cancer cells compared to isotype controls (P<0.0267 and P<0.0265, respectively). To our knowledge this is the first time that the isolation and evaluation of human anti-TK1 single domain antibodies using phage display technology has been reported. The antibody fragments isolated here may represent a valuable resource for the detection and the targeting of TK1 on tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W4214808890,"Objective The vast majority of known proteins have not been experimentally tested even at the level of measuring their expression, and the function of many proteins remains unknown. In order to decipher protein function and examine functional associations, we developed ""Cliquely"", a software tool based on the exploration of co-occurrence patterns. Computational model Using a set of more than 23 million proteins divided into 404,947 orthologous clusters, we explored the co-occurrence graph of 4,742 fully sequenced genomes from the three domains of life. Edge weights in this graph represent co-occurrence probabilities. We use the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm to detect maximal cliques in this graph, fully-connected subgraphs that represent meaningful biological networks from different functional categories. Main results We demonstrate that Cliquely can successfully identify known networks from various pathways, including nitrogen fixation, glycolysis, methanogenesis, mevalonate and ribosome proteins. Identifying the virulence-associated type III secretion system (T3SS) network, Cliquely also added 13 previously uncharacterized novel proteins to the T3SS network, demonstrating the strength of this approach. Cliquely is freely available and open source. Users can employ the tool to explore co-occurrence networks using a protein of interest and a customizable level of stringency, either for the entire dataset or for a one of the three domains—Archaea, Bacteria, or Eukarya."
https://openalex.org/W4214826356,"Q fever is a zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii. In Germany, the common sources of human infections include small ruminants that excrete the pathogen. Q fever in humans can be asymptomatic or nonspecific. However, severe disease progression is also possible, which can lead to death. Q fever in small ruminants is usually asymptomatic, although reproductive disorders may occur. To protect humans from Q fever, it is important that human and veterinary health professionals (practitioners/health authority employees) have comprehensive knowledge of the diagnosis, control and prevention of Q fever, and its zoonotic potential. To ensure and enhance this understanding, this stakeholder analysis assessed Q fever expertise in human and veterinary health professionals in Germany and investigated how these knowledge gaps can best be resolved. For this purpose, an online survey and two focus group discussions were conducted with 836 and 18 participants, respectively. Knowledge gaps are due to a lack of awareness of Q fever, especially among human health practitioners. Moreover, colleagues who have heard about Q fever still lack the necessary cross-species knowledge to successfully diagnose, control and prevent this zoonosis. Additionally, differences exist between stakeholders regarding their work context and the region in which they work. In this study, stakeholders in southwestern Germany had slightly better Q fever knowledge than their colleagues in northeastern Germany. In addition, information sources aimed at resolving knowledge gaps involve direct conversations between the stakeholders, as well as reading materials and seminars. Each of these information sources should focus on interdisciplinary resources to strengthen the cooperation between human and veterinary health professionals and to raise awareness of the strengths of each stakeholder group. These results have already been implemented by the Q-GAPS project, with goals of raising awareness of Q fever and filling knowledge gaps."
https://openalex.org/W4214831244,"In this study we merged methods from machine learning and human neuroimaging to test the role of self-induced affect processing states in biasing the affect processing of subsequent image stimuli. To test this relationship we developed a novel paradigm in which (n = 40) healthy adult participants observed affective neural decodings of their real-time functional magnetic resonance image (rtfMRI) responses as feedback to guide explicit regulation of their brain (and corollary affect processing) state towards a positive valence goal state. By this method individual differences in affect regulation ability were controlled. Attaining this brain-affect goal state triggered the presentation of pseudo-randomly selected affectively congruent (positive valence) or incongruent (negative valence) image stimuli drawn from the International Affective Picture Set. Separately, subjects passively viewed randomly triggered positively and negatively valent image stimuli during fMRI acquisition. Multivariate neural decodings of the affect processing induced by these stimuli were modeled using the task trial type (state- versus randomly-triggered) as the fixed-effect of a general linear mixed-effects model. Random effects were modeled subject-wise. We found that self-induction of a positive valence brain state significantly positively biased valence processing of subsequent stimuli. As a manipulation check, we validated affect processing state induction achieved by the image stimuli using independent psychophysiological response measures of hedonic valence and autonomic arousal. We also validated the predictive fidelity of the trained neural decoding models using brain states induced by an out-of-sample set of image stimuli. Beyond its contribution to our understanding of the neural mechanisms that bias affect processing, this work demonstrated the viability of novel experimental paradigms triggered by pre-defined cognitive states. This line of individual differences research potentially provides neuroimaging scientists with a valuable tool for exploring the roles and identities of intrinsic cognitive processing mechanisms that shape our perceptual processing of sensory stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W4214840655,"This paper reports the results of a qualitative study regarding the main attitudes and concerns of Swiss psychiatrists related to the utility, usability and acceptability of EHR and how they address the pitfalls of sharing sensitive information with other parties. A total of 20 semi-structured interviews were carried out. Applied thematic analysis was used to identify themes with regard to participation. Three main themes were identified: 1) strengths of the use of EHR in the clinical context; 2) limitations of EHR; and 3) recommendations on preserving confidentiality in health records. The study shows variable practices of EHR use in psychiatric hospitals in Switzerland and a lack of standards on how to document sensitive information in EHR."
https://openalex.org/W4214907861,"In real-time strategy games, players collect resources, control various units, and create strategies to win. The creation of winning strategies requires accurately analyzing previous games; therefore, it is important to be able to identify the key situations that determined the outcomes of those games. However, previous studies have mainly focused on predicting game results. In this study, we propose a methodology to predict outcomes and to identify information about the turning points that determine outcomes in StarCraft Ⅱ, one of the most popular real-time strategy games. We used replay data from StarCraft Ⅱ that is similar to video data providing continuous multiple images. First, we trained a result prediction model using 3D-residual networks (3D-ResNet) and replay data to improve prediction performance by utilizing in-game spatiotemporal information. Second, we used gradient-weighted class activation mapping to extract information defining the key situations that significantly influenced the outcomes of the game. We then proved that the proposed method outperforms by comparing 2D-residual networks (2D-ResNet) using only one time-point information and 3D-ResNet with multiple time-point information. We verified the usefulness of our methodology on a 3D-ResNet with a gradient class activation map linked to a StarCraft Ⅱ replay dataset."
