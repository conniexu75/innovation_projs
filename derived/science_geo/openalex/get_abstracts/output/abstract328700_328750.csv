https://openalex.org/W2070838110,"Breakdown of organic matter, an important step in the ecological circulation of chemical elements, was measured in Great Smoky Mountain and Oak Ridge forests. Greatest variation in first-year weight loss of leaves in nylon net bags was due to species (Fagus grandifolia 21 percent, Acer saccharum 32 percent, Quercus shumardii 34 percent, Quercus alba 39 percent, Morus rubra 64 percent). At elevations of 5200, 3400, and 850 ft, losses for all five species averaged, respectively, 29, 34, and 40 percent for leaves placed in spruce, hemlock, and pine stands, and 35, 40, and 46 percent for leaves placed in beech, cove hardwood, and whiteoak stands."

Elevated concentration of sodium and chloride ions were found for the winter samples of sera, but NaCl explained only a fraction of the seasonal increase in osmolarity."
https://openalex.org/W2037226150,"A surface-active aqueous solution was foamed up a glass column, removed, collapsed, and returned as down-coming liquid to drain countercurrently against the rising foam. This deliberate refluxing action greatly increased the degree of separation of the surfactant over that obtainable without reflux. The effects of altering the gas rate and the solute concentration were also studied."
https://openalex.org/W2085605678,"Black lacustrine and marine sediments occur in the McMurdo Sound region of Antarctica. The black color is due to the presence of iron sulfide, precipitated by sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrio) in the presence of decaying organic matter of algal origin. Viability of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the sediments was demonstrated in the laboratory by culturing in anaerobic liquid media. It is probable that sulfate-reducing bacteria are widely distributed in Antarctica."

https://openalex.org/W2044881459,"Studies of tumor cell cultures with antiviral antibody showed that most of the cell-associated virus and viral antigen were found at the cell membrane and were thus accessible to the effect of neutralizing antibody. Humoral antibody present in tumor tissue neutralized cell-associated virus in vivo and thus rendered the tumor cells temporarily noninfectious. When these cells were grown in vitro in the absence of antibody, virus eventually reappeared. However, the time of reappearance, amount of virus produced, and persistence of virus in such cultures depended upon the amount of virus used to produce the tumor."

For the three types, it appears that research is conducted on the average by groups and not by individuals. These conclusions are at variance with premises assumed recently by R. S. Uhrbrock (1)."
