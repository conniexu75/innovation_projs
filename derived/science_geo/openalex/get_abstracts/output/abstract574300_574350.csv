https://openalex.org/W2559440361,"While there is broad agreement that early hominins practiced some form of terrestrial bipedality, there is also evidence that arboreal behavior remained a part of the locomotor repertoire in some taxa, and that bipedal locomotion may not have been identical to that of modern humans. It has been difficult to evaluate such evidence, however, because of the possibility that early hominins retained primitive traits (such as relatively long upper limbs) of little contemporaneous adaptive significance. Here we examine bone structural properties of the femur and humerus in the Australopithecus afarensis A.L. 288-1 (""Lucy"", 3.2 Myr) that are known to be developmentally plastic, and compare them with other early hominins, modern humans, and modern chimpanzees. Cross-sectional images were obtained from micro-CT scans of the original specimens and used to derive section properties of the diaphyses, as well as superior and inferior cortical thicknesses of the femoral neck. A.L. 288-1 shows femoral/humeral diaphyseal strength proportions that are intermediate between those of modern humans and chimpanzees, indicating more mechanical loading of the forelimb than in modern humans, and by implication, a significant arboreal locomotor component. Several features of the proximal femur in A.L. 288-1 and other australopiths, including relative femoral head size, distribution of cortical bone in the femoral neck, and cross-sectional shape of the proximal shaft, support the inference of a bipedal gait pattern that differed slightly from that of modern humans, involving more lateral deviation of the body center of mass over the support limb, which would have entailed increased cost of terrestrial locomotion. There is also evidence consistent with increased muscular strength among australopiths in both the forelimb and hind limb, possibly reflecting metabolic trade-offs between muscle and brain development during hominin evolution. Together these findings imply significant differences in both locomotor behavior and ecology between australopiths and later Homo."
https://openalex.org/W2559176699,"Acyl-CoA binding domain-containing 5 (ACBD5) is a peroxisomal protein that carries an acyl-CoA binding domain (ACBD) at its N-terminal region. The recent identification of a mutation in the ACBD5 gene in patients with a syndromic form of retinal dystrophy highlights the physiological importance of ACBD5 in humans. However, the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and the precise function of ACBD5 remain unclear. We herein report that ACBD5 is a peroxisomal tail-anchored membrane protein exposing its ACBD to the cytosol. Using patient-derived fibroblasts and ACBD5 knock-out HeLa cells generated via genome editing, we demonstrate that ACBD5 deficiency causes a moderate but significant defect in peroxisomal β-oxidation of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and elevates the level of cellular phospholipids containing VLCFAs without affecting peroxisome biogenesis, including the import of membrane and matrix proteins. Both the N-terminal ACBD and peroxisomal localization of ACBD5 are prerequisite for efficient VLCFA β-oxidation in peroxisomes. Furthermore, ACBD5 preferentially binds very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (VLC-CoAs). Together, these results suggest a direct role of ACBD5 in peroxisomal VLCFA β-oxidation. Based on our findings, we propose that ACBD5 captures VLC-CoAs on the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane so that the transport of VLC-CoAs into peroxisomes and subsequent β-oxidation thereof can proceed efficiently. Our study reclassifies ACBD5-related phenotype as a novel peroxisomal disorder.

The functional significance of peroxisomes for human health is manifested by the fact that mutations in human genes encoding peroxisomal proteins lead to a spectrum of inherited peroxisomal disorders (2Wanders R.J. Metabolic functions of peroxisomes in health and disease.Biochimie. 2014; 98: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Patients with peroxisomal disorders typically develop neurological abnormalities, and the clinical severity ranges from a fatal developmental disorder to a mild degenerative disorder with symptoms such as blindness, hearing impairment, and ataxia, depending on the gene responsible and the nature of the mutation (3Berger J.

Peroxisomal disorders can be classified into peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) and single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies (SEDs). PBDs, including Zellweger syndrome, are caused by defects in the formation and/or maintenance of functional peroxisomes, and consequently patients with PBDs usually lack the entire peroxisomal metabolic functions (4Waterham H.R.

Valle D. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2003; 4: 165-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The vast majority of PBDs are associated with mutations in PEX genes encoding peroxins, most of which are involved in the import of peroxisomal proteins (5Weller S. Gould S.J. Valle D.

Peroxisome biogenesis in mammalian cells.Front. Physiol. 2014; 5: 307Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Conversely, the primary defect in SEDs resides in the peroxisomal matrix enzymes or peroxisomal membrane proteins that mediate metabolite transport. Therefore, specific peroxisome-dependent metabolic pathways are affected in patients with each of the SEDs. Well known SEDs affecting peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation pathway include X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene (7Kemp S. Pujol A. Waterham H.R. van Geel B.M.

Recently, a homozygous truncating mutation in the ACBD5 gene encoding acyl-CoA binding domain-containing 5 (ACBD5) was reported in a family with retinal dystrophy and severe neurological involvement (Ref. 14Abu-Safieh L. Alrashed M. Anazi S. Alkuraya H. Khan A.O. Al-Owain M. Al-Zahrani J. Al-Abdi L. Hashem M. Al-Tarimi S. Sebai M.-A. Shamia A. Ray-Zack M.D. Nassan M.

ACBD5 is one of the seven members of the mammalian acyl-CoA binding domain-containing protein (ACBP) family characterized by an N-terminal acyl-CoA binding domain (ACBD) (15Fan J. Liu J. Culty M. Papadopoulos V. Acyl-coenzyme A binding domain containing 3 (ACBD3; PAP7; GCP60): an emerging signaling molecule.Prog. Lipid Res. 2010; 49: 218-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Previous proteomic studies using isolated mammalian peroxisomes have identified ACBD5 as a peroxisomal protein (16Kikuchi M. Hatano N. Yokota S. Shimozawa N. Imanaka T. Taniguchi H.

Proteomics. 2007; 6: 2045-2057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, the newly described ACBD5 deficiency could be considered as a novel peroxisomal disease. Indeed, the three siblings with ACBD5 deficiency also developed white matter disease and spastic paraparesis (14Abu-Safieh L. Alrashed M. Anazi S. Alkuraya H. Khan A.O. Al-Owain M. Al-Zahrani J. Al-Abdi L. Hashem M. Al-Tarimi S. Sebai M.-A. Shamia A. Ray-Zack M.D. Nassan M.

However, the mechanisms that link ACBD5 deficiency to such a syndromic form of retinal dystrophy remain undefined. ACBD5 was recently suggested to be involved in basal autophagic degradation of peroxisome, namely pexophagy, in mammalian cell culture (18Nazarko T.Y. Ozeki K. Till A. Ramakrishnan G. Lotfi P. Yan M. Subramani S. Peroxisomal Atg37 binds Atg30 or palmitoyl-CoA to regulate phagophore formation during pexophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 204: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); however, the precise function of ACBD5 is not fully defined. Because ACBD5 harbors a conserved ACBD at the N terminus, it can be anticipated that ACBD5 exerts its function(s) through binding to acyl-CoAs and that ACBD5 functions in a peroxisome-dependent lipid metabolic pathway. Here, we demonstrate that ACBD5 is a peroxisomal tail-anchored protein exposing its N-terminal ACBD to the cytosol. ACBD5 is required for achieving efficient very-long-chain fatty acid (VLCFA) β-oxidation, and ACBD5 deficiency leads to accumulation of cellular phospholipids containing VLCFAs. Importantly, the N-terminal ACBD and peroxisomal localization of ACBD5 are prerequisite for its function. Moreover, ACBD5 likely binds preferentially very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs (VLC-CoAs). Based on our data, we propose that ACBD5 captures VLC-CoAs on the cytosolic side of the peroxisomal membrane to secure efficient transport of VLC-CoAs into peroxisomes for subsequent VLCFA β-oxidation. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation of how ACBD5 deficiency results in the pathogenesis of retinal dystrophy and associated neurological deficits in patients with ACBD5-related phenotype. Previous proteomic studies of isolated mammalian peroxisomes identified ACBD5 as a peroxisomal protein (16Kikuchi M. Hatano N. Yokota S. Shimozawa N. Imanaka T. Taniguchi H.

Proteomics. 2007; 6: 2045-2057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and immunofluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells confirmed the peroxisomal localization of endogenous ACBD5 (Fig. 1A and Ref. 18Nazarko T.Y. Ozeki K. Till A. Ramakrishnan G. Lotfi P. Yan M. Subramani S. Peroxisomal Atg37 binds Atg30 or palmitoyl-CoA to regulate phagophore formation during pexophagy.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 204: 541-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). On the basis of its primary sequence, ACBD5 is predicted to possess a transmembrane domain (TMD) close to the C terminus (Fig. 1B). Therefore, we first investigated whether ACBD5 is an integral membrane protein by subcellular fractionation followed by an alkaline extraction method (19Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. Isolation of intracellular membranes by means of sodium carbonate treatment: application to endoplasmic reticulum.J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Consistent with its peroxisomal localization, endogenous ACBD5 was recovered exclusively in the organelle-containing fraction of HeLa cells (Fig. 2A). Upon alkaline extraction, ACBD5 behaved in the same manner as PEX14, a peroxisomal membrane protein, but not AOx, a peroxisomal matrix protein (Fig. 2B), indicating that ACBD5 is a bona fide peroxisomal membrane protein.FIGURE 2.ACBD5 is a peroxisomal tail-anchored protein. A, HeLa cells were fractionated into total (T; lane 1), cytosolic (C; lane 2), and organelle-containing (O; lane 3) fractions, and equal aliquots of the fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the indicated antibodies. B, the organelle fraction of HeLa cells (A, lane 3) was treated with 0.1 m Na2CO3 and then separated into soluble (S; lane 2) and membrane (P, pellet; lane 3) fractions. Equal aliquots of each fraction, including total (T; lane 1), were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. C, HeLa cells expressing FLAG-ACBD5-HA were fixed and immunostained with the indicated antibodies after permeabilization with 1% Triton X-100 (panels a–c) or 50 μg/ml digitonin (panels d–f).

EGFP-fused proteins and peroxisomes were detected by EGFP fluorescence and immunostaining with the anti-PTS1 antibody, respectively. Merged views are also shown. F, HeLa cells expressing (lanes 1–3) or not expressing (lanes 4–6) EGFP-ACBD5C40 were fractionated and analyzed as in A.

Scale bars in C and E, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we analyzed the membrane topology of ACBD5 by means of a differential permeabilization technique. HeLa cells transiently expressing N-terminally FLAG-tagged and C-terminally HA-tagged ACBD5 (FLAG-ACBD5-HA) were immunostained with antibodies against FLAG tag, HA tag, and catalase after full permeabilization of cellular membranes with Triton X-100 or selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with digitonin. A punctate staining pattern of intraperoxisomal catalase was detected in Triton X-100-permeabilized cells but not in digitonin-permeabilized cells, thereby showing that the peroxisomal membrane remained intact in digitonin-permeabilized cells (Fig. 2C, panels c and f). In Triton X-100-permeabilizaed cells, both the N-terminal FLAG tag and the C-terminal HA tag were detected in a similar punctate pattern that coincided with catalase (Fig. 2C, panels a–c). In contrast, in digitonin-permeabilized cells where antibodies could not access intraperoxisomal epitopes, only the N-terminal FLAG tag was detectable (Fig. 2C, panels d and e). These results strongly suggest that the N-terminal region of ACBD5 is exposed to the cytosol whereas the C-terminal tail is translocated and faces the peroxisomal matrix. Based on its membrane topology, we predicted that ACBD5 would belong to the tail-anchored protein family, which is characterized by a cytosol-facing N-terminal domain and a single C-terminal TMD (20Kutay U. Hartmann E. Rapoport T.A. A class of membrane proteins with a C-terminal anchor.Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 72-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In general, the targeting information of tail-anchored proteins resides solely within their C-terminal membrane-anchoring region (21Borgese N. Brambillasca S. Colombo S. How tails guide tail-anchored proteins to their destinations.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2007; 19: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To test whether the C-terminal region of ACBD5 mediates both peroxisomal targeting and membrane anchoring, we generated several EGFP-fused ACBD5 variants (Fig. 2D) and determined their localization in HeLa cells. As expected, wild-type (WT) EGFP-ACBD5 colocalized with intraperoxisomal proteins harboring peroxisomal targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) (Fig. 2E, panels a–c). EGFP-ACBD5C40 consisting of the C-terminal 40 amino acids (aa) exhibited a similar peroxisomal localization, whereas EGFP-ACBD5ΔC lacking the C-terminal 33 aa did not localize to peroxisomes and rather was detected in cytoplasmic reticular and/or tubular structures (Fig. 2E, panels d–i). The observed localization of EGFP-ACBD5ΔC was unexpected because similar C-terminal deletion mutants of tail-anchored proteins generally show a typical cytosolic localization. Apparently, the localization of EGFP-ACBD5ΔC to cytoplasmic structures was dependent on the coiled coil domain (CCD); a further deletion of the CCD gave rise to a cytosolic localization (ΔCΔCCD; Fig. 2E, panels j–l). Although the physiological significance of this observation was unclear, our data implied that EGFP-ACBD5ΔC failed to reach peroxisomes but associated with cytoplasmic structures via the CCD region. Notably, in subcellular fractionation and alkaline extraction analyses, EGFP-ACBD5C40 showed the same behavior as a peroxisomal membrane protein, PEX13 (Fig. 2, F and G). Therefore, these results demonstrate that the C-terminal TMD-containing region of ACBD5 functions as the signal-anchor sequence for peroxisomal localization. Taken together, we concluded that ACBD5 is a peroxisomal tail-anchored membrane protein and exposes its ACBD to the cytosol. We next determined whether ACBD5 plays a role in peroxisome biogenesis using human skin fibroblasts derived from a patient with ACBD5 deficiency (ΔACBD5; Ref. 14Abu-Safieh L. Alrashed M. Anazi S. Alkuraya H. Khan A.O. Al-Owain M. Al-Zahrani J. Al-Abdi L. Hashem M. Al-Tarimi S. Sebai M.-A. Shamia A. Ray-Zack M.D. Nassan M. Al-Hassnan Z.N. et al.Autozygome-guided exome sequencing in retinal dystrophy patients reveals pathogenetic mutations and novel candidate disease genes.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 236-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that endogenous ACBD5 colocalized with PEX14 in control fibroblasts (derived from a healthy donor), but it was completely absent in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts, thus confirming the complete inactivation of the gene by the previously reported homozygous truncating mutation (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, PEX14-positive punctate structures were observed in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts (Fig. 3A, panel d), implying that the biogenesis of peroxisomal membranes is not affected in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts. To further assess the biogenesis of peroxisomes, the fibroblasts were immunostained for other peroxisomal proteins, including a membrane protein, PMP70; PTS1-harboring matrix enzymes AOx and catalase; and a PTS2-horboring matrix enzyme, alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate synthase (ADAPS). Here, fibroblasts derived from a PEX10-defective patient with Zellweger syndrome (ΔPEX10) in which peroxisomal matrix protein import is abrogated were also used as an additional control. Results showed that all the peroxisomal proteins tested were imported to punctate structures in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts (Fig. 3B), suggesting that peroxisomal membrane and matrix protein import machineries are not affected in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts. Consistently, the AOx-B chain and the mature form of ADAPS, both of which are proteolytically processed after the import into peroxisomes (22Tsukamoto T. Yokota S. Fujiki Y. Isolation and characterization of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants defective in assembly of peroxisomes.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Honsho M. Yagita Y. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y. Isolation and characterization of mutant animal cell line defective in alkyl-dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase: localization and transport of plasmalogens to post-Golgi compartments.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), were detected by immunoblotting analysis in cell lysates of control and ΔACBD5 fibroblasts but not in that of ΔPEX10 fibroblasts (Fig. 3C). Thus, our results indicate that the import of peroxisomal membrane and matrix proteins operates normally in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts and thereby that ACBD5 is dispensable for the biogenesis of peroxisomes. Given that ACBD5 possess a conserved ACBD and that peroxisomes play a prominent role in multiple anabolic and catabolic processes of lipid metabolism, we anticipated that ACBD5 deficiency might influence cellular lipid metabolism. To verify this notion, we performed lipidomic analysis (24Abe Y. Honsho M. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Fujiki Y. Very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulate in phosphatidylcholine of fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome and acyl-CoA oxidase1 deficiency.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1841: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and compared the phospholipid composition of ΔACBD5 fibroblasts with those of fibroblasts derived from a healthy donor (control), a PEX10-deficient patient (ΔPEX10), and patients with two types of peroxisomal β-oxidation deficiency, AOx deficiency (ΔAOx) and X-ALD (ΔABCD1), respectively. The β-oxidation of VLCFAs is one of the major functions of peroxisomes (2Wanders R.J. Metabolic functions of peroxisomes in health and disease.Biochimie. 2014; 98: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Notably, laboratory investigations on the ACBD5-deficient patient revealed a slight but distinct perturbation of VLCFA ratios in plasma (Table 1). We therefore focused on the total amount of phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) species containing VLCFAs with total carbon numbers of 42–48 (VLC-PtdCho). Consistent with our previous report (24Abe Y. Honsho M. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Fujiki Y. Very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulate in phosphatidylcholine of fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome and acyl-CoA oxidase1 deficiency.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1841: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the total amount of VLC-PtdCho was markedly elevated in ΔPEX10 and ΔAOx fibroblasts and was subtly increased in ΔABCD1 fibroblasts (Fig. 4A). Similar to ΔABCD1 fibroblasts, ΔACBD5 fibroblasts exhibited a slight but significant elevation in the total amount of VLC-PtdCho species (Fig. 4A). By contrast, the total amounts of PtdCho species containing medium- and long-chain fatty acids with total carbon numbers of 30–40 were comparable among all the fibroblasts analyzed (Fig. 4B). We have previously shown that almost all VLC-PtdCho species are elevated in peroxisome-deficient and ΔAOx fibroblasts, whereas only the VLC-PtdCho species containing unsaturated, monosaturated, and disaturated VLCFAs accumulate in ΔABCD1 fibroblasts (24Abe Y. Honsho M. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Fujiki Y. Very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids accumulate in phosphatidylcholine of fibroblasts from patients with Zellweger syndrome and acyl-CoA oxidase1 deficiency.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1841: 610-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this context, ΔACBD5 fibroblasts showed accumulation of broad VLC-PtdCho species irrespective of the number of double bonds (Fig. 4, C and D). To understand the mechanism underlying the accumulation of VLC-PtdCho species in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts, we then measured the peroxisomal VLCFA β-oxidation activity and found that the β-oxidation activity toward lignoceric acid (C24:0) in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts was reduced to ∼65% of control fibroblasts (Fig. 4E). Notably, the extent of reduction in the C24:0 β-oxidation activity was milder in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts as compared with that in ΔAOx fibroblasts (Fig. 4E), suggesting that the extent of deficiency in the peroxisomal VLCFA β-oxidation mirrors the level of accumulation of VLC-PtdCho species in these patient-derived fibroblasts.TABLE 1Peroxisomal metabolism in this ACBD5-deficient patientValueRef. valuePhytanic acid0.34 μm<12.01 μmPristanic acid0.25 μm<2.98 μmC2220.5 μm40–119 μmC2420 μm33–84 μmC260.65 μm0.45–1.32 μmC24/220.976<1.2C26/220.032<0.028 Open table in a new tab Thus, it is most likely that ACBD5 deficiency causes a moderate defect in the peroxisomal β-oxidation of a wide variety of VLCFAs. To examine whether ACBD5 deficiency influences other lipid metabolic processes involving peroxisomal enzymes, we also analyzed the levels of plasmenylethanolamine (PlsEtn), which harbors a vinyl ether-linked long-chain fatty alcohol at its sn-1 position, and phospholipids containing DHA (C22:6n-3). The biosynthesis of PlsEtn is initiated in peroxisomes (25Braverman N.E. Moser A.B. Functions of plasmalogen lipids in health and disease.Biochim. Biophys.

Apparently, neither the level of PlsEtn nor that of DHA-containing phospholipids was affected in ΔACBD5 fibroblasts (Fig. 4, F and G). Collectively, our results suggest that ACBD5 deficiency has no impact on either the biosynthesis of PlsEtn or the biosynthesis of DHA and that ACBD5 is involved in the β-oxidation of VLCFAs. The phenotype of human skin fibroblasts derived from an ACBD5-defective patient suggested a role of ACBD5 as a mediator of peroxisomal VLCFA β-oxidation (Fig. 4). To further assess the importance of ACBD5 in the peroxisomal VLCFA β-oxidation by making use of cells derived from the same genetic b"

Reports have shown that 68,600 people die of HBV infection and more than 300,000 deaths due to liver cancer secondary to hepatitis B every year globally. Women who are infected with HBV can vertically transmit the infection to their infants. This study aims to determine the prevalence of HBV infection and associated factors among pregnant women. Methods and Findings A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women who attended antenatal care clinic (ANC) for routine pregnancy check-up between 18 March 2015 and 15 May 2015. Data were collected by face to face interview using a pre-tested questionnaire. Serum was withdrawn for each study subject and used to test for Hepatitis B Surface Antigen (HBsAg) by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test kit. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between explanatory variables and outcome variable. The prevalence of HBV infection was found to be 6.9%. Interestingly, the history of abortion (AOR 10.9; 95% CI: 2.2–53.9), nose piercing (AOR 9.1; 95% CI: 1.34–61.79), surgical procedure (AOR 12.8; 95% CI: 1.68–97.06) and history of multiple sexual partners (AOR 16.8; 95% CI: 3.18–89.06) were significant predictors of HBV infection. Conclusions This study determined that the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women was 6.9%, implying that it is high-intermediate endemic area, which is important public health issue needs to be addressed. History of abortion, nose piercing, surgical procedures and multiple sexual partners were significantly associated with this viral infection. Accordingly we advocate that health education programs on the mode of HBV transmission, high-risk behaviors and methods of preventions should be instituted at antenatal care clinics to raise the awareness of mothers and limit the spread of infection. It is also advisable to implement nosocomial infection prevention strategies to prevent the transmissions of HBV through health care related activities such as surgical procedures. Furthermore, all pregnant women should be screened for HBV, treated if necessary to reduce their viral loads and their children vaccinated at birth with the single-dose hepatitis B vaccine to break the cycle of mother-to-child transmission."

https://openalex.org/W2557774280,"In the present study, the phenological and quantitative changes in the pollen seasons between 1973 and 2013 in the Stockholm region of Sweden were studied for nine types of pollen (hazel, alder, elm, birch, oak, grass, mugwort, willow and pine). Linear regression models were used to estimate the long term trends in duration, start- and end-dates, peak-values and the yearly accumulated pollen sums of the pollen seasons. The pollen seasons of several arboreal plant species (e.g. birch, oak and pine) were found to start significantly earlier today compared to 41 years earlier, and have an earlier peak-date, while the season of other species seemed largely unaffected. However, the long term trends in the end-dates of pollen seasons differed between arboreal and herbaceous species. For herbaceous species (grass and mugwort), a significant change towards later end-dates was observed and the duration of season was found to have increased. A significant trend towards an earlier end-date was found in the majority of the arboreal plant species (i.e. elm, oak, pine and birch), but the length of the season seemed unaffected. A trend towards an increase in yearly concentrations of pollen was observed for several species; however the reasons for this phenomenon cannot be explained unambiguously by the present study design. The trend of increasing yearly mean air temperatures in the Stockholm area may be the reason to changed phenological patterns of pollen seasons."
https://openalex.org/W2557669294,"Background Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an indicator of widespread atherosclerosis. However, most individuals with PAD, in spite of being at high cardiovascular risk, are asymptomatic. This fact, together with the limitations of the Doppler ankle-brachial index (ABI), contributes to PAD underdiagnose. The aim of this study was to compare oscillometric ABI and Doppler ABI to diagnose peripheral arterial disease, and also to examine the influence of oscillometric errors and calcified legs on the PAD diagnoses. Methods and Findings We measured the ankle-brachial indexes of 90 volunteers (n = 180 legs, age 70 ± 14 years, 43% diabetics) using both oscillometer OMRON-M3 and Doppler. For concordance analyses we used the Bland and Altman method, and also estimated the intraclass correlation coefficient. Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves were used to examine the diagnostic performance of both methods. The ABI means were 1.06 ± 0.14 and 1.04 ± 0.16 (p = 0.034) measured by oscillometer and Doppler ABIs respectively, with limits of agreement of ± 0.20 and intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.769. Oscillometer yielded 23 “error” measurements, and also overestimated the measurements in low ankle pressures. Using Doppler as gold standard, oscillometer performance for diagnosis of PAD showed an Area Under Curve = 0.944 (sensitivity: 66.7%, specificity: 96.8%). Moreover, when considered calcified legs and oscillometric “error” readings as arteriopathy equivalents, sensitivity rose to 78.2%, maintaining specificity in 96%. The best oscillometer cut-off point was 0.96 (sensitivity: 87%, specificity: 91%, positive likelihood ratio: 9.66 and negative likelihood ratio: 0.14). Conclusion Despite its limitations, oscillometric ABI could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of PAD, particularly when considering calcified legs and oscillometric “errors” readings as peripheral arterial disease equivalents."

In a clinically feasible scan time, both conventional imaging sequences as well as microstructural MRI parameters were assessed in order to quantitatively characterise WM regions that are known to differ in the thickness of their myelin sheaths, and in the presence of crossing or parallel fibre organisation.We found that diffusion imaging, MR spectroscopy (MRS), myelin water fraction (MWF), Magnetization Transfer Imaging, and Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping were myelin-sensitive in different ways, giving complementary information for characterising WM microstructure with different underlying fibre architecture. From the diffusion parameters, neurite density (NODDI) was found to be more sensitive than fractional anisotropy (FA), underlining the limitation of FA in WM crossing fibre regions. In terms of sensitivity to different myelin content, we found that MWF, the mean diffusivity and chemical-shift imaging based MRS yielded the best discrimination between areas.Multimodal assessment of WM microstructure was possible within clinically feasible scan times using a broad combination of quantitative microstructural MRI sequences. By assessing new microstructural WM parameters we were able to provide normative data and discuss their interpretation in regions with different myelin architecture, as well as their possible application as biomarker for WM disorders."

In the new scheme the attribute revocation and grant processes of users are delegated to proxy server. Our scheme supports multi attribute are revoked and granted simultaneously. Moreover, the keyword searchable function is achieved in our proposed scheme. The security of our proposed scheme is reduced to the bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption.

https://openalex.org/W2559648601,"Bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a dynamic intracellular signaling molecule that plays a central role in the biofilm life cycle. Current methodologies for the quantification of c-di-GMP are typically based on chemical extraction, representing end point measurements. Chemical methodologies also fail to take into consideration the physiological heterogeneity of the biofilm and thus represent an average c-di-GMP concentration across the entire biofilm. To address these problems, a ratiometric, image-based quantification method has been developed based on expression of the green fluorescence protein (GFP) under the control of the c-di-GMP-responsive cdrA promoter (Rybtke, M. T., Borlee, B. R., Murakami, K., Irie, Y., Hentzer, M., Nielsen, T. E., Givskov, M., Parsek, M. R., and Tolker-Nielsen, T. (2012) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 78, 5060–5069). The methodology uses the cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) as a biomass indicator and the GFP as a c-di-GMP reporter. Thus, the CFP/GFP ratio gives the effective c-di-GMP per biomass. A binary mask was applied to alleviate background fluorescence, and fluorescence was calibrated against known c-di-GMP concentrations. Using flow cells for biofilm formation, c-di-GMP showed a non-uniform distribution across the biofilm, with concentrated hot spots of c-di-GMP. Additionally, c-di-GMP was found to be localized at the outer boundary of mature colonies in contrast to a uniform distribution in early stage, small colonies. These data demonstrate the application of a method for the in situ, real time quantification of c-di-GMP and show that the amount of this biofilm-regulating second messenger was dynamic with time and colony size, reflecting the extent of biofilm heterogeneity in real time."
https://openalex.org/W2558117556,"Human serum amyloid A (SAA) has been demonstrated as a chemoattractant and proinflammatory mediator of lethal systemic inflammatory diseases. In the circulation, it can be sequestered by a high-density lipoprotein, HDL, which carries cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and apolipoproteins (Apo-AI). The capture of SAA by HDL results in the displacement of Apo-AI, and the consequent inhibition of SAA's chemoattractant activities. It was previously unknown whether HDL similarly inhibits SAA-induced sPLA2 expression, as well as the resultant HMGB1 release, nitric oxide (NO) production and autophagy activation. Here we provided compelling evidence that human SAA effectively upregulated the expression and secretion of both sPLA2-IIE and sPLA2-V in murine macrophages, which were attenuated by HDL in a dose-dependent fashion. Similarly, HDL dose-dependently suppressed SAA-induced HMGB1 release, NO production, and autophagy activation. In both RAW 264.7 cells and primary macrophages, HDL inhibited SAA-induced secretion of several cytokines (e.g., IL-6) and chemokines (e.g., MCP-1 and RANTES) that were likely dependent on functional TLR4 signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that HDL counter-regulates SAA-induced upregulation and secretion of sPLA2-IIE/V in addition to other TLR4-dependent cytokines and chemokines in macrophage cultures."

Here, we evaluated how different microbial species commonly associated with laboratory-reared Drosophila melanogaster impact host biology at the level of gene expression in the dissected adult gut and in the entire adult organism. We observed that guts from animals associated from the embryonic stage with either zero, one or three bacterial species demonstrated indistinguishable transcriptional profiles. Additionally, we found that the gut transcriptional profiles of animals reared in the presence of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae alone or in combination with bacteria could recapitulate those of conventionally-reared animals. In contrast, we found whole body transcriptional profiles of conventionally-reared animals were distinct from all of the treatments tested. Our data suggest that adult flies are insensitive to the ingestion of the bacteria found in their gut, but that prior to adulthood, different microbes impact the host in ways that lead to global transcriptional differences observable across the whole adult body."

The aim of this study was to identify socio-demographic characteristics and circumstances of death associated with age among individuals who died by suicide. Methods The study examined 121 consecutive suicides (2007–2012) occurring in the southern eastern part of Ireland (Cork city and county). Data were obtained from coroners, family informants, and health care professionals. A comparison was made between 15-24-year-old and 25-34-year-old individuals. Socio-demographic characteristics of the deceased, methods of suicide, history of alcohol and drug abuse, and findings from toxicological analysis of blood and urine samples taken at post mortem were included. Pearson’s χ2 tests and binary logistic regression analysis were performed. Results Alcohol and/or drugs were detected through toxicological analysis for the majority of the total sample (79.5%), which did not differentiate between 15-24-year-old and 25-34-year-old individuals (74.1% and 86.2% respectively). Compared to 25-34-year-old individuals, 15-24-year-old individuals were more likely to engage in suicide by hanging (88.5%). Younger individuals were less likely to die by intentional drug overdose and carbon monoxide poisoning compared to older individuals. Younger individuals who died between Saturday and Monday were more likely to have had alcohol before dying. Substance abuse histories were similar in the two age groups. Conclusion Based on this research it is recommended that strategies to reduce substance abuse be applied among 25-34-year-old individuals at risk of suicide. The wide use of hanging in young people should be taken into consideration for future means restriction strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2557249759,"Glucan synthases synthesize glucans, complex polysaccharides that are the major components in fungal cell walls and division septa. Studying regulation of glucan synthases is important as they are essential for fungal cell survival and thus popular targets for anti-fungal drugs. Linear 1,3-β-glucan is the main component of primary septum and is synthesized by the conserved β-glucan synthase Bgs1 in fission yeast cytokinesis. It is known that Rho1 GTPase regulates Bgs1 catalytic activity and the F-BAR protein Cdc15 plays a role in Bgs1 delivery to the plasma membrane. Here we characterize a novel protein Sbg1 that is present in a complex with Bgs1 and regulates its protein levels and localization. Sbg1 is essential for contractile-ring constriction and septum formation during cytokinesis. Sbg1 and Bgs1 physically interact and are interdependent for localization to the plasma membrane. Bgs1 is less stable and/or mis-targeted to vacuoles in sbg1 mutants. Moreover, Sbg1 plays an earlier and more important role in Bgs1 trafficking and localization than Cdc15. Together, our data reveal a new mode of regulation for the essential β-glucan synthase Bgs1 by the novel protein Sbg1."
https://openalex.org/W2557973207,"Early detection and intervention for dysphagia is important in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). However, previous studies have focused on how many patients with dysphagia develop CHF. Studies focusing on the comorbidity of dysphagia in patients with CHF are rare. Additionally, risk factors for dysphagia in patients with CHF are unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to clarify risk factors for dysphagia in patients with acute exacerbation of CHF. A total of 105 patients, who were admitted with acute exacerbation of CHF, were enrolled. Clinical interviews, blood chemistry analysis, electrocardiography, echocardiography, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), exercise tolerance tests, phonatory function tests, and evaluation of activities of daily living (ADL) and nutrition were conducted on admission. After attending physicians permitted the drinking of water, swallowing screening tests were performed. Patients were divided into a dysphagia group (DG) or a non-dysphagia group (non-DG) based on Functional Oral Intake Scale level. Among the 105 patients, 38 had dysphagia. A greater number of patients had history of aspiration pneumonia and dementia, and there was a higher age, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level in the DG compared with the non-DG. MMSE scores, exercise tolerance, phonatory function, status of ADL, nutrition, albumin, and transthyretin were lower in the DG compared with the non-DG. In multivariate analysis, after adjusting for age and sex, MMSE, BI score, and transthyretin was independently associated with dysphagia. Comorbidity of dysphagia was 36.1% in patients with acute exacerbation of CHF, and cognitive dysfunction and malnutrition may be an independent predictor of dysphagia."

The aim of the present study was to characterize the immune modulating properties of the food-related yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus in terms of adaptive immune responses indicating inflammation versus tolerance and to explore the mechanisms behind the observed responses. Benchmarking against a Saccharomyces boulardii strain with probiotic effects documented in clinical trials, we evaluated the ability of K. marxianus to modulate human dendritic cell (DC) function in vitro. Further, we assessed yeast induced DC modulation of naive T cells toward effector responses dominated by secretion of IFNγ and IL-17 versus induction of a Treg response characterized by robust IL-10 secretion. In addition, we blocked relevant DC surface receptors and investigated the stimulating properties of β-glucan containing yeast cell wall extracts. K. marxianus and S. boulardii induced distinct levels of DC cytokine secretion, primarily driven by Dectin-1 recognition of β-glucan components in their cell walls. Upon co-incubation of yeast exposed DCs and naive T cells, S. boulardii induced a potent IFNγ response indicating TH1 mobilization. In contrast, K. marxianus induced a response dominated by Foxp3+ Treg cells, a characteristic that may benefit human health in conditions characterized by excessive inflammation and positions K. marxianus as a strong candidate for further development as a novel yeast probiotic."

Diverse expression between CSF-1 and IL-34, suggest that IL-34 may signal via an alternate receptor. Receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase ζ (PTPRZ1, RPTP-ζ), an additional IL-34 receptor, was recently identified. Here, we aimed to assess PTPRZ1 expression in IBD and non-IBD intestinal biopsies. Further, we aimed to investigate cellular PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R expression, and cytokine- and chemokine responses by IL-34 and CSF-1. The expression of PTPRZ1 was higher in non-IBD colon compared to ileum. PTPRZ1 expression was not altered with inflammation in IBD, however, correlated to IL34, CSF1, and CSF1R. The expression patterns of PTPRZ1 and CSF-1R differed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, macrophages, and intestinal epithelial cell line. PBMCs and monocytes of the same donors responded differently to IL-34 and CSF-1 with altered expression of tumor-necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, interferon γ (IFN-γ), IL-13, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) levels. This study shows that PTPRZ1 was expressed in bowel tissue. Furthermore, CSF-1R protein was detected in an intestinal epithelial cell line and donor dependently in primary PBMCs, monocytes, and macrophages, and first hints also suggest an expression in these cells for PTPRZ1, which may mediate IL-34 and CSF-1 actions."
https://openalex.org/W2559179736,"Background Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) is currently recommended for children under five in areas where malaria transmission is highly seasonal. We explored children’s caregivers’ and community health workers’ (CHWs) responses to an extended 5-month SMC programme. Methods Thirteen in-depth interviews and eight focus group discussions explored optimal and suboptimal ‘uptake’ of SMC to examine facilitators and barriers to caregivers’ uptake. Results There did not appear to be major differences between caregivers of children with optimal and sub-optimal SMC uptake in terms of their knowledge of malaria, their perceptions of the effect of SMC on a child’s health, nor their understanding of chemoprevention. Caregivers experienced difficulty in prioritising SMC for well children, perceiving medication being for treatment rather than prevention. Prior to the study, caregivers had become accustomed to rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) for malaria, and therefore blood testing for malaria during the baseline survey at the start of the SMC programme may have positively influenced uptake. Facilitators of uptake included caregivers’ trust in and respect for administrators of SMC (including CHWs), access to medication and supportive (family) networks. Barriers to uptake related to poor communication of timings of community gatherings, travel distances, absence during SMC home deliveries, and limited demand for SMC due to lack of previous experience. Future delivery of SMC by trained CHWs would be acceptable to caregivers. Conclusion A combination of caregivers’ physical access to SMC medication, the drug regimen, trust in the medical profession and perceived norms around malaria prevention all likely influenced caregivers’ level of uptake. SMC programmes need to consider: 1) developing supportive, accessible and flexible modes of drug administration including home delivery and village community kiosks; 2) improving demand for preventive medication including the harnessing of learnt trust; and 3) developing community-based networks for users to support optimal uptake of SMC."
https://openalex.org/W2557804371,"Aim Primary failure of tooth eruption (PFE) is causally linked to heterozygous mutations of the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1R) gene. The mutants described so far lead to exchange of amino acids or truncation of the protein that may result in structural changes of the expressed PTH1R. However, functional effects of these mutations have not been investigated yet. Materials and Methods In HEK293 cells, PTH1R wild type was co-transfected with selected PTH1R mutants identified in patients with PFE. The effects on activation of PTH-regulated intracellular signaling pathways were analyzed by ELISA and Western immunoblotting. Differential effects of wild type and mutated PTH1R on TRESK ion channel regulation were analyzed by electrophysiological recordings in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Results In HEK293 cells, activation of PTH1R wild type increases cAMP and in response activates cAMP-stimulated protein kinase as detected by phosphorylation of the vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). In contrast, the PTH1R mutants are functionally inactive and mutant PTH1R/Gly452Glu has a dominant negative effect on the signaling of PTH1R wild type. Confocal imaging revealed that wild type PTH1R is expressed on the cell surface, whereas PTH1R/Gly452Glu mutant is mostly retained inside the cell. Furthermore, in contrast to wild type PTH1R which substantially augmented K+ currents of TRESK channels, coupling of mutated PTH1R to TRESK channels was completely abolished. Conclusions PTH1R mutations affect intracellular PTH-regulated signaling in vitro. In patients with primary failure of tooth eruption defective signaling of PTH1R mutations is suggested to occur in dento-alveolar cells and thus may lead to impaired tooth movement."
https://openalex.org/W2558315860,"For social species such as primates, the recognition of conspecifics is crucial for their survival. As demonstrated by the ‘face inversion effect’, humans are experts in recognizing faces and unlike objects, recognize their identity by processing it configurally. The human face, with its distinct features such as eye-whites, eyebrows, red lips and cheeks signals emotions, intentions, health and sexual attraction and, as we will show here, shares important features with the primate behind. Chimpanzee females show a swelling and reddening of the anogenital region around the time of ovulation. This provides an important socio-sexual signal for group members, who can identify individuals by their behinds. We hypothesized that chimpanzees process behinds configurally in a way humans process faces. In four different delayed matching-to-sample tasks with upright and inverted body parts, we show that humans demonstrate a face, but not a behind inversion effect and that chimpanzees show a behind, but no clear face inversion effect. The findings suggest an evolutionary shift in socio-sexual signalling function from behinds to faces, two hairless, symmetrical and attractive body parts, which might have attuned the human brain to process faces, and the human face to become more behind-like."
https://openalex.org/W2558663065,"To determine the long-term changes in the intraocular pressure (IOP) following vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD), epiretinal membrane (ERM), and macular hole (MH), and to investigate the relationship between the retinal disease and the incidence of late-onset IOP elevation.This was a retrospective, observational, comparative study. We reviewed the medical records of 54 eyes of 54 RRD patients, 117 eyes of 117 ERM patients, and 75 eyes of 75 MH patients who underwent 20-, 23- or 25-gauge vitrectomy. The IOPs before surgery and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following vitrectomy, and also at the final visit (average, 23.95 months) were evaluated. We defined a significant increase in the IOP as an increase of ≥4 mmHg from the preoperative IOP, and this increase was taken to be a 'death' event for the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.The mean follow-up period was not significantly different among the groups. The mean IOP at 3 (P = 0.001) and 12 (P = 0.011) months following the vitrectomy and at the final visit (P = 0.002) were significantly higher than that before the vitrectomy in the RRD group. The mean IOP in the RRD group was significant higher than that in the ERM group at 1 (P = 0.005), 3 (P = 0.009), and 12 (P = 0.013) months following vitrectomy, and at the final visit (P = 0.032). Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed that the RRD group had a significantly higher risk of an IOP increase following vitrectomy than the other groups (P<0.001 by log-rank test). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that a preoperative diagnosis of RRD was the only risk factor that was significantly associated with a postoperative IOP elevation after excluding eyes with a low preoperative IOP (odds ratio, 3.208; P = 0.003).A late-onset IOP elevation following vitrectomy was observed only in eyes that underwent RRD surgery. The elevation was probably caused by the specific characteristics and surgical procedures of RRD. Clinicians should pay more attention to the IOP elevation for long times after vitrectomy especially in eyes with RRD."
https://openalex.org/W2559096265,"Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is an arising public health problem in Asia, including China. Epidemiological data is necessary to enable judicious public health responses and interventions. We analyzed the epidemiological and laboratory data of 759,301 HFMD cases reported to the Hunan Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2014. Univariate and multivariable conditional logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors of fatality in HFMD. The incidence of HFMD was highest among children aged 1-3 years, compared with other age groups. Of the total HFMD cases, 7,222 (0.95%) were considered severe and 338 (0.04%) were fatal. Enterovirus-A71 was the major cause of severe and fatal cases (65.75% and 88.78%, respectively). For severe cases, the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 0.5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 0-1.5 days); the median time from diagnosis to severe illness was 2 days (IQR 1-3 days). For fatal cases, the median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 0.5 days (IQR 0-1.5 days); the median time from diagnosis to death was 1.5 days (IQR 0.5-2.5 days). In multivariable analysis, the abuse of antibiotic, glucocorticoid and pyrazolone in village clinics at basic medical institutions were identified as independent risk factors for HFMD fatal cases. In conclusion, our results suggest that the future direction to control and respond to HFMD is intensive surveillance of enterovirus-A71 and improving the ability to diagnose disease and treat patients, especially in basic medical institutions."
https://openalex.org/W2559262574,"The greatest obstacle for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients infected with the Burkholderia species is their intrinsic antibiotic resistance. For this reason, there is a need to develop new effective compounds. Glutamate racemase, an essential enzyme for the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall, is an excellent candidate target for the design of new antibacterial drugs. To this aim, we recombinantly produced and characterized glutamate racemase from Burkholderia cenocepacia J2315. From the screening of an in-house library of compounds, two Zn (II) and Mn (III) 1,3,5-triazapentadienate complexes were found to efficiently inhibit the glutamate racemase activity with IC50 values of 35.3 and 10.0 μM, respectively. Using multiple biochemical approaches, the metal complexes have been shown to affect the enzyme activity by binding to the enzyme-substrate complex and promoting the formation of an inhibited dimeric form of the enzyme. Our results corroborate the value of glutamate racemase as a good target for the development of novel inhibitors against Burkholderia."

https://openalex.org/W2558771857,"Skeletal muscle differentiation is a precisely coordinated process, and the molecular mechanism regulating the process remains incompletely understood. Here we report the identification of serine/threonine kinase 40 (Stk40) as a novel positive regulator of skeletal myoblast differentiation in culture and fetal skeletal muscle formation in vivo. We show that the expression level of Stk40 increases during skeletal muscle differentiation. Down-regulation and overexpression of Stk40 significantly decreases and increases myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts, respectively. In vivo, the number of myofibers and expression levels of myogenic markers are reduced in the fetal muscle of Stk40 knockout mice, indicating impaired fetal skeletal muscle formation. Mechanistically, Stk40 controls the protein level of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) to maintain transcriptional activities of myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2), a family of transcription factor important for skeletal myogenesis. Silencing of HDAC5 expression rescues the reduced myogenic gene expression caused by Stk40 deficiency. Together, our study reveals that Stk40 is required for fetal skeletal muscle development and provides molecular insights into the control of the HDAC5-MEF2 axis in skeletal myogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2559009752,"Presence of Burkholderia pseudomallei in soil and water is correlated with endemicity of melioidosis in Southeast Asia and northern Australia. Several biological and physico-chemical factors have been shown to influence persistence of B. pseudomallei in the environment of endemic areas. This study was the first to evaluate the interaction of B. pseudomallei with soil amoebae isolated from B. pseudomallei-positive soil site in Khon Kaen, Thailand. Four species of amoebae, Paravahlkampfia ustiana, Acanthamoeba sp., Naegleria pagei, and isolate A-ST39-E1, were isolated, cultured and identified based on morphology, movement and 18S rRNA gene sequence. Co-cultivation combined with a kanamycin-protection assay of B. pseudomallei with these amoebae at MOI 20 at 30°C were evaluated during 0-6 h using the plate count technique on Ashdown's agar. The fate of intracellular B. pseudomallei in these amoebae was also monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) observation of the CellTracker™ Orange-B. pseudomallei stained cells. The results demonstrated the ability of P. ustiana, Acanthamoeba sp. and isolate A-ST39-E1 to graze B. pseudomallei. However, the number of internalized B. pseudomallei substantially decreased and the bacterial cells disappeared during the observation period, suggesting they had been digested. We found that B. pseudomallei promoted the growth of Acanthamoeba sp. and isolate A-ST39-E1 in co-cultures at MOI 100 at 30°C, 24 h. These findings indicated that P. ustiana, Acanthamoeba sp. and isolate A-ST39-E1 may prey upon B. pseudomallei rather than representing potential environmental reservoirs in which the bacteria can persist."
https://openalex.org/W2559459041,"Human forensic STRs used for individual identification have been reported to have little power for inter-population analyses. Several methods have been developed which incorporate information on the spatial distribution of individuals to arrive at a description of the arrangement of diversity. We genotyped at 16 forensic STRs a large population sample obtained from many locations in Italy, Greece and Turkey, i.e. three countries crucial to the understanding of discontinuities at the European/Asian junction and the genetic legacy of ancient migrations, but seldom represented together in previous studies. Using spatial PCA on the full dataset, we detected patterns of population affinities in the area. Additionally, we devised objective criteria to reduce the overall complexity into reduced datasets. Independent spatially explicit methods applied to these latter datasets converged in showing that the extraction of information on long- to medium-range geographical trends and structuring from the overall diversity is possible. All analyses returned the picture of a background clinal variation, with regional discontinuities captured by each of the reduced datasets. Several aspects of our results are confirmed on external STR datasets and replicate those of genome-wide SNP typings. High levels of gene flow were inferred within the main continental areas by coalescent simulations. These results are promising from a microevolutionary perspective, in view of the fast pace at which forensic data are being accumulated for many locales. It is foreseeable that this will allow the exploitation of an invaluable genotypic resource, assembled for other (forensic) purposes, to clarify important aspects in the formation of local gene pools."
https://openalex.org/W2557265399,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are linear negatively charged polysaccharides and important components of extracellular matrices and cell surface glycan layers such as the endothelial glycocalyx. The GAG family includes sulfated heparin, heparan sulfate (HS), dermatan sulfate (DS), chondroitin sulfate (CS), keratan sulfate, and non-sulfated hyaluronan. Because relative expression of GAGs is dependent on cell-type and niche, isolating GAGs from cell cultures and tissues may provide insight into cell- and tissue-specific GAG structure and functions. In our objective to obtain structural information about the GAGs expressed on a specialized mouse glomerular endothelial cell culture (mGEnC-1) we adapted a recently published GAG isolation protocol, based on cell lysis, proteinase K and DNase I digestion. Analysis of the GAGs contributing to the mGEnC-1 glycocalyx indicated a large HS and a minor CS content on barium acetate gel. However, isolated GAGs appeared resistant to enzymatic digestion by heparinases. We found that these GAG extracts were heavily contaminated with RNA, which co-migrated with HS in barium acetate gel electrophoresis and interfered with 1,9-dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assays, resulting in an overestimation of GAG yields. We hypothesized that RNA may be contaminating GAG extracts from other cell cultures and possibly tissue, and therefore investigated potential RNA contaminations in GAG extracts from two additional cell lines, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and retinal pigmental epithelial cells, and mouse kidney, liver, spleen and heart tissue. GAG extracts from all examined cell lines and tissues contained varying amounts of contaminating RNA, which interfered with GAG quantification using DMMB assays and characterization of GAGs by barium acetate gel electrophoresis. We therefore recommend routinely evaluating the RNA content of GAG extracts and propose a robust protocol for GAG isolation that includes an RNA digestion step."
https://openalex.org/W2558953355,"High rates of mental health problems have been described in young refugees, but few studies have been conducted on substance misuse. This study aimed to investigate the patterns of hospital care and criminality associated with substance misuse in refugees who settled in Sweden as teenagers.Gender stratified Cox regression models were used to estimate the risks of criminal convictions and hospital care associated with substance misuse from national Swedish data for 2005-2012. We focused on 22,992 accompanied and 5,686 unaccompanied refugees who were aged 13-19 years when they settled in Sweden and compared them with 1 million native Swedish youths from the same birth cohort.The risks of criminal conviction associated with substance misuse increased with the length of residency in male refugees, after adjustment for age and domicile. The hazard ratios (HRs) were 5.21 (4.39-6.19) for unaccompanied and 3.85 (3.42-4.18) for accompanied refugees after more than 10 years of residency, compared with the native population. The risks were slightly lower for hospital care, at 2.88 (2.18-3.79) and 2.52(2.01-3.01) respectively. Risks were particularly pronounced for male refugees from the Horn of Africa and Iran. The risks for all male refugees decreased substantially when income was adjusted for. Young female refugees had similar risks to the general population.The risks of criminality and hospital care associated with substance misuse in young male refugees increased with time of residency in Sweden and were associated with a low level of income compared with the native Swedish population. Risks were similar in accompanied and unaccompanied refugees."
https://openalex.org/W2559074484,"Declines in honeybee populations have been a recent concern. Although causes of the declines remain unclear, environmental factors may be responsible. We focused on the potential environmental determinants of local populations of wild honeybees, Apis cerana japonica, in Japan. This subspecies has little genetic variation in terms of its mitochondrial DNA sequences, and genetic variations at nuclear loci are as yet unknown. We estimated the genetic structure and environmental determinants of local genetic diversity in nuclear microsatellite genotypes of fathers and mothers, inferred from workers collected at 139 sites. The genotypes of fathers and mothers showed weak isolation by distance and negligible genetic structure. The local genetic diversity was high in central Japan, decreasing toward the peripheries, and depended on the climate and land use characteristics of the sites. The local genetic diversity decreased as the annual precipitation increased, and increased as the proportion of urban and paddy field areas increased. Positive effects of natural forest area, which have also been observed in terms of forager abundance in farms, were not detected with respect to the local genetic diversity. The findings suggest that A. cerana japonica forms a single population connected by gene flow in its main distributional range, and that climate and landscape properties potentially affect its local genetic diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2558974023,"Training in front of mirrors is common, yet little is known about how the use of mirrors effects muscle force production. Accordingly, we investigated how performing in front of a mirror influences performance in single and multi-joint tasks, and compared the mirror condition to the established performance effects of internal focus (IF) and external focus (EF) instructions in a two part experiment. In the single-joint experiment 28 resistance-trained participants (14 males and 14 females) completed two elbow flexion maximal voluntary isometric contractions under four conditions: mirror, IF, EF and neutral instructions. During these trials, surface EMG activity of the biceps and triceps were recorded. In the multi-joint experiment the same participants performed counter-movement jumps on a force plate under the same four conditions. Single-joint experiment: EF led to greater normalized force production compared to all conditions (P≤0.02, effect-size range [ES] = 0.46-1.31). No differences were observed between neutral and mirror conditions (P = 0.15, ES = 0.15), but both were greater than IF (P<0.01, ES = 0.79-1.84). Surface EMG activity was comparable across conditions (P≥0.1, ES = 0.10-0.21). Multi-joint experiment: Despite no statistical difference (P = 0.10), a moderate effect size was observed for jump height whereby EF was greater than IF (ES = 0.51). No differences were observed between neutral and mirror conditions (ES = 0.01), but both were greater than IF (ES = 0.20-22). The mirror condition led to superior performance compared to IF, inferior performance compared to EF, and was equal to a neutral condition in both tasks. These results provide novel and practical evidence concerning mirror training during resistance type training."
https://openalex.org/W2557325859,"Peg3 (Paternally Expressed Gene 3) is an imprinted gene that encodes a zinc finger DNA-binding protein. Peg3 itself is localized in the middle of a KRAB-A (Kruppel-Associated Box) zinc finger gene cluster. The amino acid sequence encoded by its exon 7 also shows sequence similarity to that of KRAB-A, suggesting Peg3 as a KRAB-containing zinc finger gene. As predicted, the PEG3 protein was co-immunoprecipitated with KAP1, a co-repressor that interacts with KRAB-A. A series of follow-up experiments further demonstrated that the exon 7 of PEG3 is indeed responsible for its physical interaction with KAP1. ChIP and promoter assays also indicated that PEG3 likely controls its downstream genes through the KAP1-mediated repression mechanism. Overall, the current study identifies PEG3 as a KRAB-containing zinc finger protein that interacts with the co-repressor protein KAP1."

https://openalex.org/W2558681209,"In the present study, we report the discovery of a novel allosteric inhibitory site for p38α, a subclass of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) family. The putative site was discovered after inspection of the crystallographic structure of the p38α-MK2 complex. MK2 (MAPK-activated protein kinase 2) is an interesting protein playing a dual role as modulator and substrate of p38α. This intriguing behavior is due to the ability of the two proteins to form distinctive heterodimers when p38α is phosphorylated or not. We hypothesized that the regulatory action of MK2 is due to its capability to keep p38α in an inactive conformation and consequently, we investigated the atomic structure of the p38α-MK2 complex to understand such regulatory behavior at the molecular level. After inspection of the complex structure, two peptides designed from the MK2 regulatory loop in contact with p38α with sequences Tyr1-Ser2-Asn3-His4-Gly5-Leu6 (peptide-1) and [Phe0]-peptide-1 (peptide-2) in their zwitterionic form were investigated for their phosphorylation inhibitory capability in vitro. Since both peptides exhibited inhibitory capability of the p38α kinase mediated phosphorylation of MEF2A, in a subsequent step we pursued the discovery of small molecule peptidomimetics. For this purpose we characterized in detail the peptide-p38α interaction using molecular dynamics simulations, leading to the definition of a pharmacophore for the peptide-protein interaction. This hypothesis was used as query for a in silico screening, leading to the discovery of a fused ring compound with micromolar inhibitory activity. Site-directed mutagenesis studies support that the compound binds to the putative novel allosteric site in p38α."
https://openalex.org/W2558956167,"Background The usefulness of aspirin to defend against cardiovascular disease in both primary and secondary settings is well recognized by the medical profession. Multiple studies also have found that daily aspirin significantly reduces cancer incidence and mortality. Despite these proven health benefits, aspirin use remains low among populations targeted by cardiovascular prevention guidelines. This article seeks to determine the long-term economic and population-health impact of broader use of aspirin by older Americans at higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Methods and Findings We employ the Future Elderly Model, a dynamic microsimulation that follows Americans aged 50 and older, to project their lifetime health and spending under the status quo and in various scenarios of expanded aspirin use. The model is based primarily on data from the Health and Retirement Study, a large, representative, national survey that has been ongoing for more than two decades. Outcomes are chosen to provide a broad perspective of the individual and societal impacts of the interventions and include: heart disease, stroke, cancer, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, disability-free life expectancy, and medical costs. Eligibility for increased aspirin use in simulations is based on the 2011–2012 questionnaire on preventive aspirin use of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. These data reveal a large unmet need for daily aspirin, with over 40% of men and 10% of women aged 50 to 79 presenting high cardiovascular risk but not taking aspirin. We estimate that increased use by high-risk older Americans would improve national life expectancy at age 50 by 0.28 years (95% CI 0.08–0.50) and would add 900,000 people (95% CI 300,000–1,400,000) to the American population by 2036. After valuing the quality-adjusted life-years appropriately, Americans could expect $692 billion (95% CI 345–975) in net health benefits over that period. Conclusions Expanded use of aspirin by older Americans with elevated risk of cardiovascular disease could generate substantial population health benefits over the next twenty years and do so very cost-effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2559667987,"Objective To compare alternative models for the imputation of BMIM (measured weight in kilograms/measured height in meters squared) in a longitudinal study. Methods We used data from 11,008 adults examined at wave III (2001–2002) and wave IV (2007–2008) in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. Participants were asked their height and weight before being measured. Equations to predict wave IV BMIM were developed in an 80% random subsample and evaluated in the remaining participants. The validity of models that included BMI constructed from previously measured height and weight (BMIPM) was compared to the validity of models that used BMI calculated from concurrently self-reported height and weight (BMISR). The usefulness of including demographics and perceived weight category in those models was also examined. Results The model that used BMISR, compared to BMIPM, as the only variable produced a larger R2 (0.913 vs. 0.693), a smaller root mean square error (2.07 vs. 3.90 kg/m2) and a lower bias between normal-weight participants and those with obesity (0.98 vs. 4.24 kg/m2). The performance of the model containing BMISR alone was not substantially improved by the addition of demographics, perceived weight category or BMIPM. Conclusions Our work is the first to show that concurrent self-reports of height and weight may be more useful than previously measured height and weight for imputation of missing BMIM when the time interval between measures is relatively long. Other time frames and alternatives to in-person collection of self-reported data need to be examined."

Designed to improve reproducibility and sensitivity, commercial kits are commonly used for the critical step of cDNA synthesis. The present study was designed to determine the impact of these kits. mRNA from mouse brains were pooled to create serial dilutions ranging from 0.0625 μg to 2 μg, which were transcribed into cDNA using four different commercial reverse-transcription kits. Next, we transcribed mRNA from brain tissue after acute brain injury and naïve mice into cDNA for qPCR. Depending on tested genes, some kits failed to show linear results in dilution series and revealed strong variations in cDNA yield. Absolute expression data in naïve and trauma settings varied substantially between these kits. Normalization with a housekeeping gene failed to reduce kit-dependent variations, whereas normalization eliminated differences when naïve samples from the same region were used. The study shows strong evidence that choice of commercial cDNA synthesis kit has a major impact on PCR results and, consequently, on comparability between studies. Additionally, it provides a solution to overcome this limitation by normalization with data from naïve samples. This simple step helps to compare mRNA expression data between different studies and groups."

Whether intense pre-exercise hyperpnea offers similar protection and whether this might negatively affect exercise performance is unknown. Nine subjects with EIB (25±5 yrs; forced expiratory volume in 1s [FEV1], 104±15% predicted) performed an exercise challenge (ECh) followed—after 30min—by a constant-load cycling test to exhaustion. The ECh was preceded by one of four conditions: by i) control warm-up (CON) or by 10min of normocapnic hyperpnea with partial rebreathing at either ii) 50% (WU50) or iii) variable intensity (8x 30s-80%/45s-30%; WU80/30), or at iv) 70% (WU70) of maximal voluntary ventilation. FEV1 was measured at baseline and in 5-min intervals until 15min after CON/warm-up and 30min after ECh. None of the warm-up conditions induced EIB. The maximal post-ECh decrease in FEV1 was -13.8±3.1% after CON, −9.3±5.0% after WU50 (p = 0.081 vs. CON), −8.6±7.5% after WU80/30 (p = 0.081 vs. CON) and −7.2±5.0% after WU70 (p = 0.006 vs. CON), and perception of respiratory exertion was significantly attenuated (all p≤0.048), with no difference between warm-up conditions. Only after CON, FEV1 remained significantly reduced up to the start of the cycling endurance test (−8.0±4.3%, p = 0.004). Cycling performance did not differ significantly between test days (CON: 13±7min; WU50: 14±9min; WU80/30: 13±9min; WU70: 14±7min; p = 0.582). These data indicate that intense hyperpnea warm-up is effective in attenuating EIB severity and accelerating lung function recovery while none of the warm-up condition do compromise cycling performance."

Experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel rainfall simulator facility with water sprayed through sprinkler nozzles and free-flowing wind at different velocities to simulate the WDR conditions. Not only for vertical sediment distribution, but a series of experimental tests for horizontal distribution of sediments was also performed using BEST® collectors to obtain the actual total sediment mass flow by the splash-saltation in the center of the wind tunnel test section. Total mass transport (kg m-2) were estimated by analytically integrating the exponential functional relationship using the measured sediment amounts at the set trap heights for every run.

https://openalex.org/W2559362970,"Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and its severe variant, toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), are drug-induced acute inflammatory vesiculobullous reactions of the skin and mucous membranes, including the ocular surface. Even after recovery from skin symptoms, some SJS/TEN patients continue to suffer with severe ocular complications (SOCs). Therefore, this study aims to understand the pathophysiology of chronic SOCs. Because plasma lipid profiling has emerged as a useful tool to understand pathophysiological alterations in the body, we performed plasma lipid profiling of 17 patients who suffered from SJS/TEN-associated chronic SOCs. A lipidomics approach yielded 386 lipid molecules and demonstrated that plasma levels of inflammatory oxylipins increased in patients with SJS/TEN-associated chronic SOCs. In addition, oxidized phosphatidylcholines and ether-type diacylglycerols increased in the patients with chronic SOCs, while phosphoglycerolipids decreased. When we compared these lipidomic profiles with those of patients with atopic dermatitis, we found that patients with chronic SOCs, specifically, had decreased levels of ether-type phosphatidylcholines (ePCs) containing arachidonic acid (AA), such as PC(18:0e/20:4) and PC(20:0e/20:4). To confirm our finding, we recruited additional patients, who suffered from SOC associated with SJS/TEN (up to 51 patients), and validated the decreased plasma levels of AA-containing ePCs. Our study provides insight into the alterations of plasma lipidomic profiles in chronic SOCs and into the pathophysiology of SJS/TEN-associated chronic SOCs."
https://openalex.org/W2559661033,"In this paper, we propose a modified dynamic decode-and-forward (MoDDF) relaying protocol to meet the critical requirements for user equipment (UE) relays in next-generation cellular systems (e.g., LTE-Advanced and beyond). The proposed MoDDF realizes the fast jump-in relaying and the sequential decoding with an application of random codeset to encoding and re-encoding process at the source and the multiple UE relays, respectively. A subframe-by-subframe decoding based on the accumulated (or buffered) messages is employed to achieve energy, information, or mixed combining. Finally, possible early termination of decoding at the end user can lead to the higher spectral efficiency and more energy saving by reducing the frequency of redundant subframe transmission and decoding. These attractive features eliminate the need of directly exchanging control messages between multiple UE relays and the end user, which is an important prerequisite for the practical UE relay deployment."
https://openalex.org/W2558970144,Exponential Smooth Transition Autoregressive (ESTAR) models can capture non-linear adjustment of the deviations from equilibrium conditions which may explain the economic behavior of many variables that appear non stationary from a linear viewpoint. Many researchers employ the Kapetanios test which has a unit root as the null and a stationary nonlinear model as the alternative. However this test statistics is based on the assumption of normally distributed errors in the DGP. Cook has analyzed the size of the nonlinear unit root of this test in the presence of heavy-tailed innovation process and obtained the critical values for both finite variance and infinite variance cases. However the test statistics of Cook are oversized. It has been found by researchers that using conventional tests is dangerous though the best performance among these is a HCCME. The over sizing for LM tests can be reduced by employing fixed design wild bootstrap remedies which provide a valuable alternative to the conventional tests. In this paper the size of the Kapetanios test statistic employing hetroscedastic consistent covariance matrices has been derived and the results are reported for various sample sizes in which size distortion is reduced. The properties for estimates of ESTAR models have been investigated when errors are assumed non-normal. We compare the results obtained through the fitting of nonlinear least square with that of the quantile regression fitting in the presence of outliers and the error distribution was considered to be from t-distribution for various sample sizes.
https://openalex.org/W2557385056,"Neurons exhibit strong coupling of electrochemical and metabolic activity. Increases in intrinsic fluorescence from either oxidized flavoproteins or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) [NAD(P)H] in the mitochondria have been used as an indicator of neuronal activity for the functional mapping of neural circuits. However, this technique has not been used to investigate the flow of olfactory information within the circuitry of the main olfactory bulb (MOB). We found that intrinsic flavoprotein fluorescence signals induced by electrical stimulation of single glomeruli displayed biphasic responses within both the glomerular (GL) and external plexiform layers (EPL) of the MOB. Pharmacological blockers of mitochondrial activity, voltage-gated Na+ channels, or ionotropic glutamate receptors abolished stimulus-dependent flavoprotein responses. Blockade of GABAA receptors enhanced the amplitude and spatiotemporal spread of the flavoprotein signals, indicating an important role for inhibitory neurotransmission in shaping the spread of neural activity in the MOB. Stimulus-dependent spread of fluorescence across the GL and EPL displayed a spatial distribution consistent with that of individual glomerular microcircuits mapped by neuroanatomic tract tracing. These findings demonstrated the feasibility of intrinsic fluorescence imaging in the olfactory systems and provided a new tool to examine the functional circuitry of the MOB."
