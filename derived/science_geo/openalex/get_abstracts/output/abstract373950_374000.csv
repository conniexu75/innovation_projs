However, a strong and universally responding system to express genes under Cre control is still lacking. We have generated a set of Cre reporter mice with strong, ubiquitous expression of fluorescent proteins of different spectra. The robust native fluorescence of these reporters enables direct visualization of fine dendritic structures and axonal projections of the labeled neurons, which is useful in mapping neuronal circuitry, imaging and tracking specific cell populations in vivo. Using these reporters and a high-throughput in situ hybridization platform, we are systematically profiling Cre-directed gene expression throughout the mouse brain in several Cre-driver lines, including new Cre lines targeting different cell types in the cortex. Our expression data are displayed in a public online database to help researchers assess the utility of various Cre-driver lines for cell-type-specific genetic manipulation."

https://openalex.org/W2160007553,"The circadian clock controls many aspects of human physiology, and disturbances in circadian rhythms have been linked to cardiovascular disease. Masao Doi et al. now delineate a new pathway by which the circadian clock influences hormone production and blood pressure in mice—clock genes control expression of an aldosterone biosynthetic enzyme, such that increased activity of this enzyme in mice with a disrupted circadian clock may account for the increased aldosterone levels and salt-sensitive hypertension seen in these mice. Malfunction of the circadian clock has been linked to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases. We show that mice lacking the core clock components Cryptochrome-1 (Cry1) and Cryptochrome-2 (Cry2) (Cry-null mice) show salt-sensitive hypertension due to abnormally high synthesis of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone by the adrenal gland. An extensive search for the underlying cause led us to identify type VI 3β-hydroxyl-steroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b6) as a new hypertension risk factor in mice. Hsd3b6 is expressed exclusively in aldosterone-producing cells and is under transcriptional control of the circadian clock. In Cry-null mice, Hsd3b6 messenger RNA and protein levels are constitutively high, leading to a marked increase in 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-isomerase (3β-HSD) enzymatic activity and, as a consequence, enhanced aldosterone production. These data place Hsd3b6 in a pivotal position through which circadian clock malfunction is coupled to the development of hypertension. Translation of these findings to humans will require clinical examination of human HSD3B1 gene, which we found to be functionally similar to mouse Hsd3b6."

https://openalex.org/W2143262939,"Primates base perceptual judgments on some sensory inputs while ignoring others. The covert selection of sensory information for perception is often thought to be accomplished mostly by the cerebral cortex, whereas the overt orienting toward relevant stimuli involves various additional structures such as the superior colliculus, a subcortical region involved in the control of eye movements. Contrary to this view, we show that the superior colliculus is necessary for determining which stimuli will inform perceptual judgments, even in the absence of orienting movements. Reversible inactivation of the superior colliculus in monkeys performing a motion discrimination task caused profound inattention for stimuli in the affected visual field, but only when distracters containing counterinformative signals appeared in the unaffected field. When distracting stimuli contained no information, discrimination performance was largely unaffected. Thus, the superior colliculus is a bottleneck in the covert selection of signals for perceptual judgments."

https://openalex.org/W1976643149,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) Ser/Thr kinase signals in at least two multiprotein complexes distinguished by their different partners and sensitivities to rapamycin. Acute rapamycin inhibits signaling by mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) but not mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), which both promote cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Although mTORC2 regulation remains poorly defined, diverse cellular mitogens activate mTORC1 signaling in a manner that requires sufficient levels of amino acids and cellular energy. Before the identification of distinct mTOR complexes, mTOR was reported to autophosphorylate on Ser-2481 in vivo in a rapamycin- and amino acid-insensitive manner. These results suggested that modulation of mTOR intrinsic catalytic activity does not universally underlie mTOR regulation. Here we re-examine the regulation of mTOR Ser-2481 autophosphorylation (Ser(P)-2481) in vivo by studying mTORC-specific Ser(P)-2481 in mTORC1 and mTORC2, with a primary focus on mTORC1. In contrast to previous work, we find that acute rapamycin and amino acid withdrawal markedly attenuate mTORC1-associated mTOR Ser(P)-2481 in cycling cells. Although insulin stimulates both mTORC1- and mTORC2-associated mTOR Ser(P)-2481 in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner, rapamycin acutely inhibits insulin-stimulated mTOR Ser(P)-2481 in mTORC1 but not mTORC2. By interrogating diverse mTORC1 regulatory input, we find that without exception mTORC1-activating signals promote, whereas mTORC1-inhibitory signals decrease mTORC1-associated mTOR Ser(P)-2481. These data suggest that mTORC1- and likely mTORC2-associated mTOR Ser-2481 autophosphorylation directly monitors intrinsic mTORC-specific catalytic activity and reveal that rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 signaling in vivo by reducing mTORC1 catalytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2048916500,"Several members of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) family are involved in the response to DNA double-strand breaks. One of these, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), is comprised of three subunits, with the kinase activity residing in the catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs. In this study, Tom Blundell and colleagues have solved the structure of human DNA-PKcs, at a resolution sufficient to see the overall folds. The structure reveals that the many HEAT repeats bend the protein into a circular structure. The kinase domain, encoded in the C-terminal domain, sits on one side of the structure. While the overall architecture of the catalytic subunit allows speculation about regions where conformational changes may occur, confirmation of such interactions awaits higher resolution data. If broken chromosomes arising from DNA double-strand breaks are left unrepaired or incorrectly repaired, they can lead to genomic changes that may result in cell death or cancer. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which comprises the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and the heterodimer Ku70/Ku80, has a major role in the repair of double-strand breaks. The crystal structure of human DNA-PKcs is now presented, in which the overall fold is clearly visible. Broken chromosomes arising from DNA double-strand breaks result from endogenous events such as the production of reactive oxygen species during cellular metabolism, as well as from exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation1,2,3. Left unrepaired or incorrectly repaired they can lead to genomic changes that may result in cell death or cancer. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), a holoenzyme that comprises the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)4,5 and the heterodimer Ku70/Ku80, has a major role in non-homologous end joining—the main pathway in mammals used to repair double-strand breaks6,7,8. DNA-PKcs is a serine/threonine protein kinase comprising a single polypeptide chain of 4,128 amino acids and belonging to the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-related protein family9. DNA-PKcs is involved in the sensing and transmission of DNA damage signals to proteins such as p53, setting off events that lead to cell cycle arrest10,11. It phosphorylates a wide range of substrates in vitro, including Ku70/Ku80, which is translocated along DNA12. Here we present the crystal structure of human DNA-PKcs at 6.6 Å resolution, in which the overall fold is clearly visible, to our knowledge, for the first time. The many α-helical HEAT repeats (helix–turn–helix motifs) facilitate bending and allow the polypeptide chain to fold into a hollow circular structure. The carboxy-terminal kinase domain is located on top of this structure, and a small HEAT repeat domain that probably binds DNA is inside. The structure provides a flexible cradle to promote DNA double-strand-break repair."
https://openalex.org/W2074872905,"Comparative gene identification-58 (CGI-58), also designated as α/β-hydrolase domain containing-5 (ABHD-5), is a lipid droplet-associated protein that activates adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and acylates lysophosphatidic acid. Activation of ATGL initiates the hydrolytic catabolism of cellular triacylglycerol (TG) stores to glycerol and nonesterified fatty acids. Mutations in both ATGL and CGI-58 cause “neutral lipid storage disease” characterized by massive accumulation of TG in various tissues. The analysis of CGI-58-deficient (Cgi-58−/−) mice, presented in this study, reveals a dual function of CGI-58 in lipid metabolism. First, systemic TG accumulation and severe hepatic steatosis in newborn Cgi-58−/− mice establish a limiting role for CGI-58 in ATGL-mediated TG hydrolysis and supply of nonesterified fatty acids as energy substrate. Second, a severe skin permeability barrier defect uncovers an essential ATGL-independent role of CGI-58 in skin lipid metabolism. The neonatal lethal skin barrier defect is linked to an impaired hydrolysis of epidermal TG.

Because excessive cellular concentrations of nonesterified FA are toxic, eukaryotic cells detoxify them by esterification to triacylglycerols (TG), which are subsequently stored in cellular lipid droplets (LD). Adipose tissue is the major storage organ for TG. However, some LD are found in essentially all cell types and tissues. Depending on the nutritional status and the energy demand of an organism, TG are synthesized (lipogenesis) or catabolized (lipolysis). Defects in the control of the finely regulated balance between lipogenesis and lipolysis result in the development of metabolic disorders such as obesity, type II diabetes, lipodystrophy, and neutral lipid storage disease (NLSD) (1.Dorfman M.L.

Hormonal stimulation leads to dissociation of CGI-58 from these binding partners and its translocation to the proximity of ATGL (23.Granneman J.G. Moore H.P. Granneman R.L. Greenberg A.S. Obin M.S.

The physiological role of this reaction in vivo is currently unknown. The importance of CGI-58 for TG catabolism in humans is evident from clinical observations in patients affected with mutations in the gene encoding CGI-58. Mutant versions of CGI-58 fail to stimulate ATGL (17.Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R.

However, the symptoms exhibited by the two groups of patients differ in two important ways. In contrast to patients with dysfunctional ATGL, CGI-58 mutations in humans are always associated with lamellar ichthyosis, a rare skin disorder, whereas myopathy, a hallmark of patients with NLSD associated with skeletal and cardiac myopathy, is less commonly observed. Accordingly, the disorder caused by defective CGI-58 was designated “neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis (NLSDI)” (15.Fischer J. Lefèvre C. Morava E. Mussini J.M. Laforêt P.

To address the potential rate-limiting role of CGI-58 in the regulation of cellular TG catabolism and to uncover currently unknown molecular mechanisms leading to disease development, we generated a CGI-58-deficient mouse model by disruption of exon 4–7 (coding for amino acids 172–351 of the mature protein), a gene region that has been linked to NLSDI development in humans (17.Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G. Gorkiewicz G. Zechner R.

The observed phenotype of CGI-58-deficient mice included the following: (i) growth retardation, (ii) systemic TG accumulation in multiple tissues, and (iii) an impaired development of the skin permeability barrier. A 3.5-kb CGI-58 intron 3 sequence was amplified by PCR using HM-1 genomic embryonic stem (ES) cell DNA as template and cloned into pBlueKS(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate the 5′ part of the long arm of the targeting vector. The 3′ part of the long arm of the targeting vector, a 6.0-kb genomic sequence encompassing CGI-58 exon 4–7, was amplified by PCR and cloned into pBlueKS(−). The 5′ and 3′ parts of the targeting vector were cloned upstream and downstream of a single loxP sequence flanked by compatible restriction sites. To generate the short arm, a 2.0-kb CGI-58 DNA fragment downstream to exon 7 was amplified and cloned into pBK-CMV harboring a loxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette. Subsequently, the 3.2-kb DNA fragment encompassing the selection cassette and the short arm was cloned into the plasmid containing the long arm of the targeting vector. A diphtheria toxin A cassette was introduced 5′ to the long arm to generate the final targeting vector. The linearized targeting vector was transfected into HM-1 ES cells by electroporation. G418-resistant clones were picked and expanded. Clones that underwent homologous recombination were transfected with a plasmid encoding Cre-recombinase (28.Taniguchi M. Sanbo M. Watanabe S. Naruse I. Mishina M. Yagi T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 679-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to generate ES cell clones harboring a null CGI-58 allele. Four independent clones were injected into 3.5-day-old C57Bl/6 blastocysts and transferred into pseudo-pregnant recipient mice. Chimeric animals with a high degree of coat color chimerism were bred with C57Bl/6 mice. Germ line transmission of the CGI-58 manipulated allele was observed by coat color and verified by Southern and Northern blotting. Genotyping of mice was routinely performed by PCR analysis of tail tip DNA using FIREPol® DNA polymerase (Solis BioDyne, Tartu, Estonia) and three primers in a single reaction as follows: forward, 5′-GTC ATG GTT GTG GGG AAA TC-3′; reverse I, 5′-AGG AAG GGG TAT TCT GCA GG-3′; and reverse II, 5′-CTT CTT CCA GCT GCT TCT GC-3′. Atgl−/− mice (ATGL knock-out mice) were generated as described previously (14.Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Animals were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility (12-h light/dark cycle) and fed a standard laboratory chow. Genomic DNA was prepared with the DNeasy® blood and tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For restriction fragment analysis, 10 μg of genomic DNA were digested with EcoRI restriction enzymes. DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by depurination with 0.2 n HCl and denaturation with 0.5 n NaOH. After neutralization with Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, DNA was transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (GE Healthcare) and hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe. The external probe for DNA analysis was generated by PCR from HM-1 genomic ES cell DNA using the following primer pair: forward, 5′-GGAATTCCC AGA CGC CAG TGA CTA AGG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGAATTCAA CTC CTG CCT ATC TCT GTG G-3′. The PCR primers introduced the EcoRI restriction enzyme sites (underlined). The PCR product was ligated into the respective restriction enzyme site of pBlueKS(−) plasmid. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was isolated from mouse tissue using the TRI Reagent® procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Ten μg of total RNA were resolved by formaldehyde/agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane. Murine CGI-58 mRNA was hybridized with a 32P-labeled murine CGI-58 cDNA probe generated by PCR from epididymal adipose tissue as described previously (17.Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G.

Gene-specific probes for both Southern and Northern blot analysis were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (GE Healthcare) using the Prime-a-Gene® DNA labeling kit according to manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). After hybridization and washing, signals were visualized by exposure to PhosphorImager Screen (GE Healthcare). 15 μg of LD protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE according to standard protocols (29.Ausubel F.M.

Brasaemle). Specifically bound immunoglobulins were detected in a second reaction using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:10,000 dilution) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection (ECL, GE Healthcare). MEF were derived from E12.5-day-old Cgi-58−/− (CGI-58 knock-out mice), Atgl−/−, and wild-type mouse embryos and cultured on gelatinized plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To investigate TG synthesis in MEF, confluent cell layers of MEF (passage 4) were incubated in the presence of oleic acid (200 and 400 μm, respectively) bound to defatted BSA at a molar FA/BSA ratio of 3:1. After 24 h, the medium was removed; cells were washed twice with PBS, and the cellular TG content was measured as outlined below. For in vivo radiolabeling of MEF TG stores, confluent cell layers were incubated for 24 h with 400 μm oleate (containing 2.5 μCi of [9,10-3H]oleic acid/μmol of oleate) bound to BSA at a molar FA/BSA ratio of 3:1. LD were isolated and purified by density gradient centrifugation as described previously (17.Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P. Strauss J.G.

For determining LD TG and protein concentrations, aliquots of LD preparations were adjusted to a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. TG and protein concentrations were measured using commercial kits (Thermotrace triglycerides reagent, Thermo Electron Corp., Victoria, Australia, and Bradford protein assay, Bio-Rad) and were found to be comparable in all preparations (typically 80 μg of protein/μmol of TG). The LD TG hydrolase activities were determined by self-digestion of purified LD as described previously (17.Lass A. Zimmermann R. Haemmerle G. Riederer M. Schoiswohl G. Schweiger M. Kienesberger P.

Full thickness skin and liver were surgically prepared; subcutaneous tissue was scraped off, and skin and liver tissue were washed in ice-cold PBS supplemented with 100 units/ml heparin and 1 mm EDTA. Epidermis was separated from dermis by incubating skin tissue in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA and 1 g/liter glucose at 37 °C for 45 min. Homogenization of tissues was performed on ice in buffer A (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, pH 7.0) using an Ultra Turax (IKAR, Janke & Kunkel, Germany). After centrifugation at 20,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min, the infranatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g and 4 °C for 90 min. The TG-free infranatant was assayed using a phospholipid-emulsified triolein (330 μm) substrate containing [9,10-3H]triolein (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with or without addition of 200 ng of GST-tagged CGI-58 (GST-CGI-58) as described previously (17.Lass A.

Total lipids were extracted twice from murine total carcass or tissue homogenates with chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (66:33:1, v/v), and phase separation was achieved by the addition of water. Total lipids from MEF were extracted three times in hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v). After lipid extraction, tissue homogenates or MEF were solubilized in 0.3 n NaOH, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for several hours, and the protein content was determined using BCA reagent (Pierce) and BSA as standard. For the extraction of covalently bound lipids, the alkaline-hydrolyzed samples were extracted with chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (66:33:1, v/v). After centrifugation (1,400 × g, 15 min), the lower organic phase was collected, and lipids were analyzed as described below. Lipids were dried, reconstituted in chloroform, and spotted onto a Silica Gel 60 plate (Merck). Neutral lipids were resolved in hexane/diethyl ether/glacial acetic acid (70:29:1, v/v) with authentic standards. Epidermal ceramide species were separated twice using chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (190:9:1 v/v/v) as solvent system (30.Wertz P.W. Miethke M.C. Long S.A. Strauss J.S. Downing D.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 410-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Spots were visualized by established carbonization method or with iodine vapor, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Dried lipids of murine tissues or MEF were redissolved in 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and TG content was measured using Infinity triglycerides reagent (Thermo Electron Corp., Victoria, Australia). ω-Hydroxyceramides (ω-OH-ceramides), acylceramides, and phospholipids were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MSMS) using a Quantum TSQ (Thermo), coupled to an Accela ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system (Thermo). The column was a Thermo Hypersil GOLD, 100 × 1 mm (1.9 μm), and operated at 50 °C. Water (solvent A) and acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol (5:2, v/v, solvent B), both containing 1% of NH4Ac (1 m aqueous solution) and 0.1% formic acid, were used as solvent system. The gradient started with 35% solvent B, increased to 70% within 4 min, then to 100% within 16.5 min, and remained at 100% for 9.5 min. After the analysis, the column was equilibrated at starting conditions for 5 min. The flow rate was 0.250 ml/min. Ionization was performed by a heated electrospray ionization operating in the positive ion mode with a spray voltage of 4,000 V. Ceramide species were identified by a precursor ion scan for the characteristic fragment at m/z 264.3. Argon was used as collision gas. The collision energy was set to 30 V for analyses of ω-OH-ceramides and to 50 V for acylceramides. Collision gas pressure was 0.7 millitorr. Samples were diluted with solvent B, and N-(dodecanoyl) sphing-4-enine (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL) was added as an internal standard. Phosphatidylcholine species were measured by a precursor ion scan for the characteristic fragment at m/z 184.1 and 30 V collision energy. Phosphatidylethanolamine species were measured by a neutral loss scan for m/z 141.0 and 25 V collision energy. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine 24:0 (12:0/12:0, Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.) were added as internal standard, respectively. Radiolabeling of lipid species in the epidermis was performed as described for cultured skin fibroblasts (31.Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In brief, dorsal 3 × 3-mm sized epidermal sheets were incubated in DMEM containing 1% (w/v) delipidated BSA and 400 μm oleate (12.5 μCi/μmol oleate) bound to delipidated BSA at a molar FA/BSA ratio of 3:1. After 5 h, epidermal sheets were washed with PBS and chased in the presence or absence of 20 μm orlistat in DMEM containing 1% (w/v) delipidated BSA. At various time points, epidermal sheets were washed, and lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol/glacial acetic acid (66:33:1, v/v), separated by TLC, and measured as described above. Anesthetized newborn mice were sacrificed by decapitation. Blood samples were collected using a Microvette® CB 300 (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Plasma FA and TG concentrations were determined using commercial kits (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany; Thermo Electron Corp., Victoria, Australia). Blood glucose levels were measured using blood glucose strips and the Accu-Check glucometer (Roche Diagnostics). Skin pieces were fixed overnight in 4% neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin, cut into 4–6-μm-thick sections, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin using established protocols. For visualization of vacuoles within granulocytes, blood smears from newborn mice were stained by combined May-Grünwald-Giemsa according to established protocols. To visualize neutral lipids in liver tissue, tissue samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, sectioned, and stained with Sudan III following a standard protocol. For determination of keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation, antibodies against cytokeratin 14 (CK14, Novocastra Laboratories, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK), cytokeratin 6 (CK6, Covance Inc., Emeryville, CA), fillagrin (Fila, Covance), and Ki67 (Novocastra) were evaluated for use on formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens using different methods of pretreatment. Tissue sections were deparaffinized by xylene, rehydrated in graded alcohols, and submitted to microwave epitope retrieval (40 min at 150 watts in 0.01 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0). After treatment in 1% H2O2 for 10 min, sections were incubated for 1 h using Dako antibody-diluent (Dako, Vienna, Austria). Final dilutions were as follows: cytokeratin 14 (1:50), cytokeratin 6 (1:500), fillagrin (1:500), and Ki67 (1:500). After enhancement using MultiLink Dako (E0453) diluted 1:100 and StreptABComplex/horseradish peroxidase Dako (K0377) diluted 1:100 for 30 min each, detection was performed using AEC Substrate Chromogen Ready-to-Use (Dako K3464) under microscopic control. For electron microscopy, tissue was fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.01 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.3, dehydrated, and embedded in resin (AGAR-100, Agar Scientific, Essex, UK). 50-nm-thick sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate/lead citrate and studied in a Philips CM 100 electron microscope. Newborn mice were euthanized, immersed in PBS containing 0.1% toluidine blue (Sigma) for 4 h, and photographed (32.McMahon A. Butovich I.A. Mata N.L. Klein M. Ritter 3rd, R. Richardson J. Birch D.G. Edwards A.O. Kedzierski W. Mol. Vis. 2007; 13: 258-272PubMed Google Scholar). Full-thickness skin pieces (∼1 cm2) from newborn wild-type and Cgi-58−/− mice were grafted onto the left and right sides of athymic nude mice (Charles River Laboratories, Sulzfeld, Germany). Wound edges were sutured. After 3 weeks, the grafted skin was investigated for hair growth, and sections were stained for differentiation markers as described above. Statistical significance was determined by the Student's unpaired t test (two-tailed). Group differences considered significant for p < 0.05 (*), p < 0.01 (**), and p < 0.001 (***). To investigate the physiological role of CGI-58 in vivo, we generated mice lacking functional CGI-58. For that purpose, we designed a targeting vector harboring a loxP-flanked neomycin resistance gene cassette (neo) downstream to the polyadenylation sequence and an additional loxP recombination site in intron 3 of the murine cgi-58 gene (Fig. 1A). This vector was electroporated into ES cells. Cells that underwent homologous recombination were selected and subsequently transfected with a plasmid encoding Cre-recombinase. ES cell clones harboring a CGI-58 null allele were used for blastocyst injection to generate CGI-58-deficient mice. Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA confirmed the disruption of the Cgi-58 gene (Fig. 1B). Cgi-58−/− mice showed no expression of CGI-58 mRNA analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 1C). Mice heterozygous for the targeted allele exhibited ∼50% reduced CGI-58 mRNA expression levels compared with wild-type mice. CGI-58 protein levels in Cgi-58−/− mice were analyzed by Western blot analysis of LD proteins isolated from newborn mice (Fig. 1D). Using a polyclonal rabbit anti-CGI-58 antiserum, wild-typ"

This suggests that these personality differences are more likely to be due to automatic emotional processing. 'Social value orientation' characterizes individual differences in anchoring attitudes toward the division of resources. Here, by contrasting people with prosocial and individualistic orientations using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we demonstrate that degree of inequity aversion in prosocials is predictable from amygdala activity and unaffected by cognitive load. This result suggests that automatic emotional processing in the amygdala lies at the core of prosocial value orientation."

Methodology/Principal Findings KRAS mutations were retrospectively studied using polymerase chain reactions and subsequent sequencing of codons 12 and 13 (exon 2) in 110 patients with metastatic colorectal tumors. These studies were performed using tissue samples from both the primary tumor and their related metastases (93 liver, 84%; 17 lung, 16%). All patients received adjuvant 5-Fluorouracil-based polychemotherapy after resection of metastases. None received anti-EGFR therapy. Mutations in KRAS were observed in 37 (34%) of primary tumors and in 40 (36%) of related metastases, yielding a 94% level of concordance (kappa index 0.86). Patients with primary tumors possessing KRAS mutations had a shorter disease-free survival period after metastasis resection (12.0 vs 18.0 months; P = 0.035) than those who did not. A higher percentage of KRAS mutations was detected in primary tumors of patiens with lung metastases than in patients with liver metastases (59% vs 32%; p = 0.054). To further evaluate this finding we analyzed 120 additional patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer who previously had their primary tumors evaluated for KRAS mutational status for clinical purposes. Separately, the analysis of these 120 patients showed a tendency towards a higher degree of KRAS mutations in primary tumors of patients with lung metastases, although it did not reach statistical significance. Taken together the group of 230 patients showed that KRAS was mutated significantly more often in the primary tumors of patients with lung metastases (57% vs 35%; P = 0.006). Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest a role for KRAS mutations in the propensity of primary colorectal tumors to metastasize to the lung."

The chemotherapeutic agents fenretinide and bortezomib induce apoptosis through endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in these tumor types. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the early events of ER stress signaling and response pathways induced by fenretinide and bortezomib are mediated by the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α)-ATF4 signaling pathway. Treatment of neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines with fenretinide, bortezomib, or thapsigargin resulted in induction of eIF2α signaling, characterized by increased expression of phosphorylated eIF2α, ATF4, ATF3, and GADD34. These events correlated with induction of the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa. The cytotoxic response, characterized by up-regulation of Noxa and cell death, was dependent on ATF4, but not the ER-related pro-death signaling pathways involving GADD153 or IRE1. Although PERK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α enhanced ATF4 protein levels during ER stress, cell death in response to fenretinide, bortezomib, or thapsigargin was not abrogated by inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation through PERK knockdown or overexpression of wild-type eIF2α. Furthermore, ATF4 induction in response to ER stress was dependent primarily on transcriptional activation, which occurred in a PERK- and phosphorylated eIF2α-independent manner. These results demonstrate that ATF4 mediates ER stress-induced cell death of neuroectodermal tumor cells in response to fenretinide or bortezomib. Understanding the complex regulation of cell death pathways in response to ER stress-inducing drugs has the potential to reveal novel therapeutic targets, thus allowing the development of improved treatment strategies to overcome chemoresistance.

https://openalex.org/W2044233897,"One of the major characteristics of chloroplast membranes is their enrichment in galactoglycerolipids, monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG), whereas phospholipids are poorly represented, mainly as phosphatidylglycerol (PG). All these lipids are synthesized in the chloroplast envelope, but galactolipid synthesis is also partially dependent on phospholipid synthesis localized in non-plastidial membranes.

In this report, we analyze the regulation of MGDG synthesis by phosphatidic acid (PA), which is a general precursor in the synthesis of all glycerolipids and is also a signaling molecule in plants.

In contrast, PA activates the enzyme when supplied. This is shown in leaf homogenates, in the chloroplast envelope, as well as on the recombinant MGDG synthase, MGD1. PG can also activate the enzyme, but comparison of PA and PG effects on MGD1 activity indicates that PA and PG proceed through different mechanisms, which are further differentiated by enzymatic analysis of point-mutated recombinant MGD1s.

IntroductionChloroplast membrane lipids are mostly composed of non-phosphorous galactoglycerolipids i.e. monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) 2The abbreviations used are: MGDGmonogalactosyldiacylglycerolMGDMGDG synthaseCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidPAphosphatidic acidDGDGdigalactosyldiacylglycerolPGphosphatidylglycerolDAGdiacylglycerolAEBSF4-2-aminoethyl benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloridePLDphospholipase DDTTdithiothreitolTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) that represent more than 50 and 30% of thylakoid lipids, respectively. Phosphatidylglycerol is the main phospholipid in plastids, representing about 10% of thylakoid lipids. Each of those glycerolipid classes is represented by a range of molecular species differing in the acyl composition at sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the glycerol backbone. Based on the model of cyanobacterial lipids, the prokaryotic type of glycerolipids contains a 16-carbon fatty acid at the sn-2 position of glycerol. The eukaryotic type contains an 18-carbon fatty acid at the sn-2 position. Some plants, such as Arabidopsis or spinach, have both prokaryotic- and eukaryotic-type MGDG, whereas other plants, such as pea or cucumber, have only eukaryotic-type MGDG. DGDG is mostly of eukaryotic type in all plants. Chloroplast PG contains exclusively a prokaryotic-type DAG moiety in contrast to non-plastidial PG. These different chloroplast lipids are assembled in the chloroplast envelope (1.Block M.A. Douce R. Joyard J. Rolland N. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 92: 225-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Most enzymes have now been identified, but their functioning and regulation remain largely unknown.MGDG is synthesized by MGDG synthase (MGD), which transfers galactose from UDP-gal to DAG. In Arabidopsis, there are three MGDG synthases, and among them, MGD1, is necessary for synthesis of galactolipids and for development of photosynthetic membranes (2.Jarvis P. Dörmann P. Peto C.A. Lutes J. Benning C. Chory J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 8175-8179Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 3.Kobayashi K. Kondo M. Fukuda H. Nishimura M. Ohta H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17216-17221Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). MGD1 utilizes DAG derived from two main sources, either from a DAG de novo synthesized in plastid envelope by double acylation of glycerol-3 phosphate and PA dephosphorylation (prokaryotic DAG) or from a DAG derived from endoplasmic reticulum phosphatidylcholine (PC) possibly through a phospholipase D enzymatic step (eukaryotic DAG) (1.Block M.A. Douce R. Joyard J. Rolland N. Photosynth. Res. 2007; 92: 225-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). MGD1 can produce prokaryotic- and eukaryotic-type MGDG with the same efficiency (4.Maréchal E. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5788-5798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MGD1 localizes at the inner envelope membrane (IEM). The protein anchors to the membrane as a monotopic protein through protein-lipid interaction to the external monolayer of the IEM (5.Miege C. Marechal E. Shimojima M. Awai K. Block M.A. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Douce R. Joyard J. Eur J Biochem. 1999; 265: 990-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 6.Awai K. Marechal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Native and recombinant MGD1 are known to be active as homodimers (5.Miege C. Marechal E. Shimojima M. Awai K. Block M.A. Ohta H. Takamiya K. Douce R. Joyard J. Eur J Biochem. 1999; 265: 990-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Each MGD1 monomer is likely to be organized in two Rossmann folds (N- and C-domains) (7.Botte C. Jeanneau C. Snajdrova L. Bastien O. Imberty A. Breton C. Marechal E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34691-34701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Visualization of surface hydrophobic regions suggested that MGD1 interacts with the membrane surface by its N-domain, whereas the C-domain protrudes above the membrane. Although MGD1 is a membrane protein and synthesizes MGDG using a lipid substrate (DAG), its mechanisms of interaction with hosting membrane, lipid substrate, and product remain unclear. Moreover, the enzyme activity might potentially be regulated by anionic lipids: PG, SQDG, or PA (8.Covés J. Joyard J. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Ohta H. Shimojima M. Arai T. Masuda T. Shioi Y. Takamiya K. Kader J.C. Mazliak P. Plant Lipid Metabolism.

Aardvark Global Publishing Company, Salt Lake City2007Google Scholar). Because (i) PA is a general precursor in the glycerolipid synthesis pathway and a signaling molecule in plants, and (ii) MGD1 is essential for chloroplast development, regulation by PA potentially represents a way of controlling chloroplast biogenesis during plant development. Using both native and recombinant MGD1 protein, we therefore analyzed in this report the enzymatic characteristics of regulation of MGD1 by PA. We also compared the regulation effects of PA and PG on the enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicalsLipids were purchased as follows, DAG (Sigma D0138), PA (Sigma P9511), 18:1/18:1-PA (Sigma P2767), 16:0/18:1-PA (Avanti Polar lipids 840857c), 16:0/16:0-PA (Sigma P4013), PG (Sigma P0514), and PC (Sigma P3017). 18:1/16:0-PA was purified by two-dimensional TLC after hydrolysis of 18:1/16:0-PC (Sigma P4142) by PLD activity (Sigma L4384) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Expression was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 18 °C. The protein was recovered in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 12% (w/v) glycerol, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, subjected to chromatography on a Ni2+-charged resin (Ni-NTA-agarose, Qiagen GmbH, Germany), from which it was eluted with 50–100 mm imidazole. Imidazole was removed from the protein fraction by gel filtration on BiogelP6DG (Bio-Rad). In this buffer, the recombinant protein was soluble, and its purity was estimated to be more than 95% after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.

The powder was resuspended in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 6 mm CHAPS, 25 mm KCL, 25 mm KH2PO4, 2% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, and immediately used for measurement of MGDG synthase activity. The measurement was monitored at 23 °C with 7 mol% DAG, 350 μm [14C]UDP-gal (22.9 GBq·mol−1) and 1.5 to 4 μg·μl−1 protein. As lipid concentration, the surface concentration of the relevant lipid relative to all mixed micelle components ([lipid]/([detergent]+Σ[lipids]) expressed in mol%) was used as a rough representation of the lipid concentration in the vicinity of the enzyme. Labeled galactolipids were analyzed, and radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation.Measurement on Chloroplast EnvelopeAn envelope fraction purified from thermolysin-treated spinach chloroplasts was incubated in 10 mm Tricine-NaOH, pH 9, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT for 15 min at 23 °C. One volume was then added to 1 volume of 100 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 12 mm CHAPS, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm KH2PO4 with 7 mol% DAG, and 750 μm UDP-[14C]gal (22.9 GBq·mol−1) for a protein concentration of 0.9–1.3 μg·μl−1.Measurement on Recombinant MGD1Wild-type or mutant MGD1 proteins were usually incubated in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.8, 6 mm CHAPS, 150 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 25 mm KCl, 25 mm KH2PO4 with 7 mol% DAG and 750 μm UDP-[14C]gal (22.9 GBq·mol−1) for a protein concentration of 11 ng·μl−1 or as indicated. Kinetic data were fitted with the Hill equation (Equation 1), V=Vmax×[S]n/(K05∩+[S]∩)(Eq. 1) where V is the enzyme velocity, S the PA or PG or UDP-gal concentration, K0.5 the concentration of S where V = ½Vmax, and n the Hill coefficient using the nonlinear least squares method (17.Bates D.M.

The membrane was blocked in 5% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin in TTBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl with 0.1%, v/v, Tween 20) for 1 h. The membrane was then incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle stirring in the same solution containing about 0.5–1.5 μg·μl−1 of MGD1 protein. The membrane was washed four times for 5 min in TTBS and then incubated for 1 h with anti-His monoclonal antibody 1/5000 (Sigma) or anti-spinach MGD1 (1/500) in TTBS with 3% skimmed milk. The membrane was washed as before, incubated with anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate 1/5000 (Jackson Immunoresearch) in TTBS with 3% skimmed milk, washed four times in TTBS, followed by once in TBS before ECL detection.Liposome Binding AssayDried lipids were resuspended at 2 μg·μl−1 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C. Liposomes were then vigorously vortexed for 5 min before centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Purified recombinant MGD1 was diluted in the same medium at 0.1 μg·μl−1 and collected as a supernatant after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Protein and liposomes were incubated together for 30 min at 30 °C. Liposomes were finally harvested as a pellet by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE with silver nitrate staining.RESULTSActivation of the MGDG Synthase Activity of Leaf Homogenates by PAIn a first evaluation of galactolipid synthesis tuning by specific lipids, MGDG synthase activity was measured in leaf homogenates of 2-week-old Arabidopsis plants. The level of activity was quantified following transfer of radioactive galactose from UDP-gal onto DAG added to the homogenate. We observed a moderate MGDG synthase activity that was stimulated 5 times by addition of 1.5 mol% of PA (Fig. 1A). Stimulation by PA was not due to conversion of PA into DAG, because in the absence of exogenous DAG, no activity was detected. PLDs are highly active in ground leaves and could generate enough PA to maintain a basal level of MGDG synthase activity in leaf homogenates. We therefore considered inhibiting the presumed formation of PA by phospholipases D using AEBSF. AEBSF has been previously reported as an inhibitor of PLD activity in leaf extracts (19.Andrews B. Bond K. Lehman J.A. Horn J.M. Dugan A. Gomez-Cambronero J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 20.Andersson M.X. Kjellberg J.M. Sandelius A.S. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2004; 1684: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), a property we confirmed in our system (supplemental Fig. S1). We verified that pure recombinant atMGD1, expected as the most active MGDG synthase in leaf homogenates (see below), was not inhibited by AEBSF (Fig. 1B). We observed that the MGDG synthase activity of leaf homogenates was lower in the presence of AEBSF and that, upon addition of PA, some MGDG synthase activity was restored (Fig. 1A). DGDG synthase activity in leaf homogenates was low and independent of DAG and PA (Fig. 1C). Our conclusion was therefore that PA was an activator of the MGDG synthase of leaf homogenates.PA in leaf homogenates is likely to be very transient dependent on both anabolism and catabolism. This may dynamically regulate MGDG synthase activity. Kinetics analysis of the MGDG synthase activity of leaf homogenates showed that the incorporation of galactose into MGDG was linear with time and stimulated by addition of PA (Fig. 1D). When AEBSF was added at the beginning of the kinetics, no activity was detected in the absence of additional PA. Interestingly, the addition of AEBSF after 15 min of incorporation very rapidly stopped MGDG synthase activity (Fig. 1D). These results were consistent with the following: (i) the MGDG synthase activity of leaf homogenates was dependent on the constant presence of PA, (ii) decrease of PA production led to a decrease of the MGDG synthase activity, and (iii) PLDs were able to produce PA necessary for MGDG synthase activation.However, the AEBSF effect was only partially restored by PA addition (Fig. 1A). To confirm that PA issued from PLDs had an impact on the level of MGDG synthase activity in leaf homogenates, we assayed the MGDG synthase activity of leaf homogenates in a mutant deleted of PLD. Twelve PLDs have already been reported in Arabidopsis (21.Qin C. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1057-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Most of them are expected to be active only in the presence of Ca2+ except the 2 PLDζ proteins. Because no Ca2+ was added in our assay and PLDζ2 had been previously shown to be involved in the phosphate deprivation-induced synthesis of galactolipids in roots (12.Li M. Qin C. Welti R. Wang X. Plant Physiol. 2006; 140: 761-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 22.Cruz-Ramírez A. Oropeza-Aburto A. Razo-Hernández F. Ramirez-Chávez E. Herrera-Estrella L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 6765-6770Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we chose to assay a mutant deleted of PLDζ2. We observed that the mutant exhibited a little less MGDG synthase activity compared with the wild type (Fig. 1E). When PA was added, MGDG synthase activity was more highly increased in the mutant than in the wild type. No activity was detected in the mutant as in the wild type with the addition of PA alone (no addition of DAG). As a result, the ratio of MGDG synthase activity obtained in the absence to presence of exogenous PA was 2-fold lower in pldζ2 than in the wild type. The DGDG synthase activity was a little higher in the mutant than in the wild type but still insensitive to addition of DAG or PA (Fig. 1F). These data therefore (i) confirmed that PA was important for activation of the MGDG synthase, and (ii) indicated that PLDζ2 was a potent source of PA for activation of the MGDG synthase in leaf homogenates.Effect of PA on the MGDG Synthase Activity of Chloroplast EnvelopeIn leaves, the MGDG synthase enzyme is located in the chloroplast envelope (6.Awai K. Marechal E. Block M.A. Brun D. Masuda T. Shimada H. Takamiya K. Ohta H. Joyard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 10960-10965Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). To date, the MGDG synthase activity has been classically measured in chloroplast envelope fractions isolated from leaves. A sufficient amount of DAG is present in the purified envelope to sustain the activity except when the envelope is isolated from thermolysin-treated chloroplasts (15.Dorne A.J. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. FEBS Letters. 1982; 145: 30-34Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed thermolysin hydrolyzes the galactolipid-galactolipid galactosyltransferase, which is present on the surface of chloroplasts and responsible for DAG formation during isolation of the chloroplast envelope. The supply of exogenous DAG is therefore required for measurement of MGDG synthase activity in the envelope isolated from thermolysin-treated chloroplasts. In contrast, PA addition was never reported to be required to detect MGDG synthase activity in the envelope from either thermolysin-treated or non-treated chloroplasts. The PA level in the isolated chloroplast envelope is low and undetectable by conventional techniques. However, our data suggested that a low concentration of PA could be sufficient to activate MGDG synthase. We questioned whether PA was necessary for activation of the chloroplast envelope MGDG synthase and was present in sufficient amounts in the isolated envelope to allow MGDG synthase activity.To decrease endogenous PA, a chloroplast envelope fraction was prepared from thermolysin-treated spinach chloroplasts and preincubated to favor envelope-associated PA phosphatase activity. High pH and absence of DAG during pretreatment were expected to allow PA phosphatase activity (23.Malherbe A. Block M.A. Joyard J. Douce R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23546-23553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Then, the envelope fraction was supplemented with DAG and incubated in MGDG synthase activity buffer. We thus observed a barely detectable MGDG synthase activity (Fig. 2A). When exogenous PA was added, the MGDG synthase activity was high in contrast. Only radiolabeled MGDG was formed indicating the absence of DGDG synthase and galactolipid-galactolipid galactosyltransferase activities (Fig. 2B). Several molecular species of PA, either of eukaryotic- or prokaryotic-type, were able to stimulate the MGDG synthase activity, although the 16:0/16:0 molecular species was less active than the 16:0/18:1 (Fig. 2C). PG had only a slight effect, whereas PC was not active. The MGDG synthase activity was dependent on the PA concentration and a range of about 0.5 mol% PA (16:0/18:1-PA) was sufficient to reach half-maximal activity of the enzyme (Fig. 2D). Our conclusion was that PA had a regulatory effect on the native MGDG synthase present in chloroplast envelope.FIGURE 2Effect of PA on MGDG synthase measured in isolated spinach chloroplast envelope.

Using this form of the enzyme, the effect of PA was analyzed. In the absence of PA, the enzyme alone had no activity (Fig. 3A). In contrast, several acyl species of PA were able to activate the enzyme although less efficiently for the 16:0/16:0 molecular species. PG was partially effective but not PC. A conversion of PA into DAG was excluded because almost no activity was found with PA when exogenous DAG was absent. These results suggested that the MGDG synthase was allosterically activated by PA and that PG could play a similar role as PA.FIGURE 3Effect of PA on the MGDG synthase activity of atΔ1–137MGD1.

In contrast, APOBEC2 (which, along with AID, is likely the oldest member of the AID/APOBEC family (1.Conticello S.G. Thomas C.J. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2005; 22: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar)) is exclusively expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscle (4.Liao W. Hong S.H. Chan B.H. Rudolph F.B. Clark S.C. Chan L. Biochem.

Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: C1904-C1916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure of APOBEC2 was the first structure of an AID/APOBEC protein to have been determined and indeed has been used as a paradigm on which to model the structures of the other polynucleotide deaminase family members (6.Prochnow C. Bransteitter R. Klein M.G. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2007; 445: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The function of APOBEC2 is, however, wholly unknown. On the basis of its homology to APOBEC1, it has widely been speculated to be an RNA-editing enzyme, although it has not yet been demonstrated to exhibit any biochemical or physiological activity. Here, to gain insight into the biology of APOBEC2, we have analyzed its pattern of expression within skeletal muscle and have also identified phenotypic consequences of APOBEC2 deficiency. Skeletal muscle comprises several fiber types that exhibit different metabolic features for energy production (7.Berchtold M.W. Brinkmeier H. Müntener M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1215-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Fast-twitch fibers have a high potential for producing ATP by anaerobic pathways and high enzymatic activities of glycolytic enzymes, whereas slow-twitch fibers have higher aerobic potential and higher activities of enzymes related to oxidative metabolism (8.Takekura H. Yoshioka T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1987; 8: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We found that APOBEC2 is especially associated with slow-twitch fibers and is particularly abundant in soleus muscle (which has a high proportion of slow fibers) but that APOBEC2 deficiency actually causes a shift from fast to slow fibers in soleus muscle, which is evident even in young mice. Once the mice age to >6 months, a mild myopathy develops. Thus, APOBEC2 is required for normal muscle development, affecting the ratio of slow to fast myofibers, although our investigations into the biochemical properties of the protein do not provide especial support to the idea that it fulfills its function through RNA editing. APOBEC2-deficient mice (9.Mikl M.C. Watt I.N. Lu M. Reik W. Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S. Rada C. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1275-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar) were established by digesting minced limb muscles from 2–5-day-old mice with Liberase Blendzyme 3 (0.14 units/ml; Roche Diagnostics, West Sussex, UK) in Ham's F-10 medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) without FBS for 30–45 min. After passing through a nylon mesh and washing in Ham's F-10 + 20% FBS, cells were resuspended in growth medium (Ham's F-10 and 20% FBS containing 2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Roche Diagnostics)). Myoblasts were enriched as the cells that did not adhere to plastic dishes during two rounds of preplating for 45 min each and cultured on collagen-coated dishes for at least 2 weeks, repeating the preplating procedure twice weekly. To induce myoblast differentiation, the growth medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% horse serum. Cell fusion index was determined as the ratio of the number of nuclei in myotubes (cells with two or more nuclei) to the number of nuclei in solitary cells. Six randomly chosen fields from each dish were counted at a magnification of ×100. For histology, serial transverse 5-μm sections of frozen or paraffin-embedded muscle were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. For immunohistochemistry, freshly prepared tissue samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, and sections (5–8 μm) were cut and mounted. After blocking for 30 min with 10% FBS and 2% goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST), myosin HC isoform expression was determined by incubating sections with mAb (Sigma) MY-32 or A4.951, specific for slow myosin HC, and mAb NOQ7.5.4D, specific for fast myosin, and developing with biotinylated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG), followed by streptavidin/peroxidase reagents (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To stain for APOBEC2, sections were subjected to antigen retrieval in which deparaffinized and rehydrated slides were boiled (2× 5 min in 0.1 m Tris (pH 9) for APOBEC2 staining and in 0.1 m citrate (pH 6) for myosin HC staining) and, after cooling, treated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 10 min, followed by two 5-min washes with phosphate-buffered saline and blocking for 30 min with 2% goat serum in PBST. Detection of APOBEC2 was performed using an affinity-purified anti-APOBEC2 polyclonal antiserum (diluted 1:1000 in PBST) prepared from rabbits that had been hyperimmunized with a fusion of MBP to mouse APOBEC2. The serum was absorbed against boiled MBP-expressing Escherichia coli, and APOBEC2-specific antibodies were then purified by binding to MBP-APOBEC2 fusion protein that had been coupled to a HiTrap-NHS-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and elution (after extensive washing) with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.8). The staining was developed using biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antiserum and a streptavidin/peroxidase/substrate kit (VECTASTAIN, Vector Laboratories). For Western blots, myosin HC was detected using mAb A4.1025 (1:200 dilution; Alexis, London, UK), whereas histone H3 was detected using mAb 6002 (1:10,000 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). APOBEC2 was detected either with a polyclonal antiserum (either generated from rabbits immunized with MBP-APOBEC2 or obtained commercially (Abcam)) or with anti-APOBEC2 mAb hA2-33-1 (IgG2bκ; 0.5 μg/ml). This mAb was generated by fusion of spleen cells from A/J mice that had been hyperimmunized with an MBP-human APOBEC2 fusion protein with cells of the mouse NS0 plasmacytoma. mAb hA2-33-1 was obtained following screening of hybridoma supernatants for antibodies recognizing both mouse and human APOBEC2. 6M. Lu and M. S. Neuberger, unpublished data. Western blots were developed using goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Suffolk, UK, or Vector Laboratories), and bands were visualized using ECL. Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was generated from aliquots (3 μg) of total RNA that had been extracted from muscle samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed in triplicate using the LightCycler system (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The expression levels of APOBEC2 mRNA were determined by normalizing relative to hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase expression. The forward and reverse primers were 5′-GACCGGTTCTGTCATGTCG and 5′-ACCTGGTTCATCATCACTAATCAC for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase and 5′-TCCTGAAGTAGGCAACAGAGC and 5′-GCCATCCTGGTCATTGCT for APOBEC2, respectively. Northern blot analyses were performed on total RNA purified and DNase I-treated using an RNeasy® fibrous tissue kit (Qiagen GmbH) and probed with APOBEC2 and β-actin cDNAs labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. To determine the native molecular mass of APOBEC2, extracts of mouse gastrocnemius muscle were prepared by disruption under liquid N2 and homogenization in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 15 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics), and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). They were then clarified by centrifugation (twice at 350 × g for 5 min), treated (or not) with RNase A (100 μg/ml; Sigma), adjusted to 150 mm in NaCl, and subjected to gel filtration on a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) that had been calibrated using a calibration kit for molecular weights of 12,000–200,000 (Sigma). Fractions containing APOBEC2 were identified by Western blotting. Myosin HC isoforms in extracts of snap-frozen muscle samples were also distinguished by virtue of their differential mobility in high resolution, low cross-linked 8% acrylamide/glycerol gels as described previously (12.Mizunoya W. Wakamatsu J. Tatsumi R. Ikeuchi Y. Anal. Biochem. 2008; 377: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies were performed to screen for possible RNA binding essentially as described (14.Navaratnam N. Shah R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The binding site for APOBEC1 in apoB mRNA (A-I in Ref. 14.Navaratnam N. Shah R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), as well as a sequence of 32 tandem AU repeats, was transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase from PCR products in the presence of 80 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Labeled RNA (5 ng, ∼2 × 108 cpm/μg) was incubated with 1 μg of MBP-APOBEC1 or MBP-APOBEC2 fusion protein that had been purified from E. coli in 15 μl of buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm NaCl) for 30 min at room temperature in microtiter plates. The plates were put on ice and irradiated with 250 mJ/cm2 UV light in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Samples were treated with 0.5 mg/ml RNase A for 15 min at 37 °C, separated on a 12% BisTris gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and analyzed by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager. Previous studies (4.Liao W. Hong S.H. Chan B.H. Rudolph F.B. Clark S.C. Chan L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 5.Anant S.

Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S. Rada C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7270-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) have revealed that APOBEC2 expression is largely restricted to striated muscle. To ascertain whether APOBEC2 is present in similar abundance in all myofibers, we developed conditions that allowed an immunohistochemical analysis. Although APOBEC2 was readily detected in all hind limb muscle fibers examined, the intensity of staining differed between individual fibers (Fig. 1A). Analysis of both serial and longitudinal sections revealed that the observed variation in staining intensity reflected a difference between individual fibers rather than simply variation in intensity along the fiber length. Staining of serial sections with antibodies against different myosin HC isoforms revealed that stronger APOBEC2 staining was much more frequently observed in slow rather than fast myofibers (Fig. 1, B and C). To determine whether APOBEC2 expression levels change during myoblast differentiation, we used Western blot analysis to monitor APOBEC2 abundance during in vitro differentiation of neonatal mouse myoblasts. Expression of APOBEC2 (like that of myosin HC) dramatically increased during late differentiation, in contrast to the relatively constant level of histone H3 expression (Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained during in vitro differentiation of the mouse C2C12 myoblast cell line (data not shown). However, APOBEC2 levels do not appear to be significantly different in newly formed (as opposed to well established) myofibers. In mice lacking dystrophin (mdx mice), significant muscle pathology develops with age and is manifested by an increased proportion of regenerating fibers (small fibers and fibers with centrally located nuclei) (15.Spencer M.J. Mellgren R.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2645-2655Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We did not detect evidence of differential APOBEC2 staining of such newly formed fibers (Fig. 1D). If APOBEC2 is generally more highly expressed in slow as opposed to fast fibers, one would expect higher abundance of APOBEC2 in soleus compared with gastrocnemius muscle. Using both Northern and Western blot analyses (because these provide more quantitative information on abundance than immunohistochemistry), it is evident that (in both young and old mice) APOBEC2 is indeed much more highly expressed in soleus muscle than in other muscles examined (Fig. 3). Thus, APOBEC2 expression increases late during myoblast differentiation and, although widely expressed in striated muscle, is much more abundant in soleus compared with gastrocnemius muscle and in slow as opposed to fast myofibers. Previous studies revealed that APOBEC2-deficient mice are viable and fertile and reach adulthood (9.Mikl M.C. Watt I.N. Lu M. Reik W. Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S. Rada C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7270-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, to screen for the possibility of more subtle developmental defects, we compared overall body mass in a cohort of APOBEC2-deficient and control littermates that had been generated by interbreeding APOBEC2+/− heterozygotes. The results revealed that, at the time of weaning, APOBEC2-deficient mice of both genders had a total body mass that was significantly (15–20%) lower than that of control wild-type or heterozygous littermates (Fig. 4A). The reduction in body weight persisted as the mice grew older, with there still being a substantial body weight reduction in 6-month-old mice. The overall body mass difference appeared to broadly correlate with a general reduction of the mass of individually dissected skeletal muscles (Fig. 4B), although we could not exclude the possibility that reduced mass of other body components might not contribute disproportionately to the overall reduction in body weight of APOBEC2-deficient mice. A body mass difference was in fact evident from birth: APOBEC2-deficient pups born to male APOBEC2-deficient fathers and heterozygous mothers were 14% lighter at 24 h than their heterozygous littermates (Fig. 4C). The weight reduction was not a result of competition between APOBEC2-deficient and wild-type littermates because it was also observed when comparing offspring of homozygous APOBEC2−/− breedings with control inbreedings (data not shown). Given the differential abundance of APOBEC2 in fast and slow muscle fibers, we wondered whether APOBEC2 deficiency would affect the development of these fiber forms. Immunohistochemical analysis did indeed reveal a significant change in the ratio of fiber forms in soleus muscle of APOBEC2−/− mice: the proportion of fibers staining with an antibody against slow myosin HC increased from 31% in 15-week-old wild-type mice to 40% in knock-out mice (Fig. 5A). Comparison of soleus muscle extracts from 3-month-old APOBEC2-deficient and control mice by SDS-PAGE revealed that APOBEC2 deficiency was indeed accompanied by an increase in the ratio of slow to fast myosin HC isoforms as demonstrated by an increase in the proportion of type I (slow) and concomitant disappearance of type IIb isoforms. This change was already evident at 3 weeks of age (Fig. 5, B and C). We were somewhat surprised that, although APOBEC2 was preferentially expressed in slow muscle, APOBEC2 deficiency actually led to an increase in the proportion of slow fibers in soleus muscle. However, a similar correlation between reduced APOBEC2 expression and a fast-to-slow fiber-type switch was seen following muscle denervation. Thus, removal of a section of the sciatic nerve provides an experimentally useful model for muscle atrophy and fiber-type shift because it yields a quick and pronounced change in skeletal muscle (16.Nwoye L. Mommaerts W.F. Simpson D.R. Seraydarian K. Marusich M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: 401-408PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Midrio M. Danieli-Betto D. Megighian A. Velussi C. Catani C. Carraro U. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 420: 446-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Denervation of both mouse and rat soleus muscle has recently been found to be associated with a switch from fast to slow fiber type (18.Agbulut O. Vignaud A. Hourde C. Mouisel E. Fougerousse F. Butler-Browne G.S. Ferry A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2009; 296: C205-C214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 19.Sato Y. Shimizu M. Mizunoya W. Wariishi H. Tatsumi R. Buchman V.L. Ikeuchi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2009; 73: 1749-1756Google Scholar), and at least in the case of rat, a proteomic analysis suggested an accompanying reduction in APOBEC2 (19.Sato Y. Shimizu M. Mizunoya W. Wariishi H. Tatsumi R. Buchman V.L. Ikeuchi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2009; 73: 1749-1756Google Scholar). We therefore performed a denervation analysis in mouse and found that, in both soleus and EDL muscle, this led to a substantial decrease in APOBEC2 expression, as judged by both Western and Northern blotting, as well as an increase in the ratio of slow to fast myosin HC isoforms (Fig. 6). Although APOBEC2-deficient mice are smaller than controls and exhibit an increased proportion of slow fibers in soleus muscle, they appear healthy and do not have a significantly reduced life span. We nevertheless examined muscle from both 8-week-old and 8–10-month-old APOBEC2-deficient mice to see whether there was any histological evidence of myopathy. Whereas the younger mice showed no increase in the proportion of regenerating fibers, myopathic changes were evident in all muscle types examined from the older animals. Not only was there increased variability in the size of myofibers in all muscles examined, but there was also an increased proportion of myofibers harboring centrally (as opposed to peripherally) located nuclei (Fig. 7 and Table 1), classic signs of regenerating muscle and postnatal myofibers associated with myopathy. Although striking, the myopathy evident in 8–10-month-old APOBEC2-deficient mice was significantly milder than that evident in 6-month-old mdx mice, which carry a mutated dystrophin gene (see Fig. 1D). Furthermore, no change was observed in the localization of laminin or dystrophin in the muscle tissue of APOBEC2-deficient mice (data not shown).TABLE 1Quantification of central nucleated myofibers in hematoxylin/eosin sections of control and APOBEC2-deficient hind limb musclesVastus and rectus femorisControlA2−/−No. fibers in sectionNo. central nuclei%No. fibers in sectionNo. central nuclei%22983.4924252.0710500.0014874.7325020.801561610.2612721.571602213.7521200.001742614.9417942.2312653.97214177.94212219.91183168.74Total: 11181.35 (±1.37)aMean ± S.D. as in Fig. 6C.17508.48 (±4.34)aMean ± S.D. as in Fig. 6C.Gastrocnemius17242.333333911.7113410.75389307.7123231.29266155.6427020.742072411.5929351.711621911.7326310.3825272.78Total: 13801.2 (±0.72)aMean ± S.D. as in Fig. 6C.Total 17438.53 (±3.79)aMean ± S.D. as in Fig. 6C.EDL32420.62289279.3433510.302703011.1114610.681563623.0824120.832365724.1533820.592983511.7430530.98404379.1633430.902373213.502343615.38Total: 20370.70 (±0.23)aMean ± S.D. as in Fig. 6C.14.68 (±5.89)aMean ± S.D. as in Fig. 6C.a Mean ± S.D. as in Fig. 6C. Open table in a new tab Thus, APOBEC2 deficiency does yield an evident myopathy, but it is not especially severe, and unlike the reduction in muscle mass and fiber-type switch, the myopathy develops only in older mice. Interestingly, whereas APOBEC2-deficient mice already show a marked reduction in body mass without evident myopathy at the time of weaning, a similar early body mass reduction is not as evident in mdx mice despite the fact that mdx mice go on to develop much more severe pathology. This presumably reflects a compensatory hypertrophy that develops in the mdx mice. Thus, mdx mice that are also deficient in APOBEC2 exhibit the early body mass reduction characteristic of APOBEC2 deficiency along with the severe pathology attributable to the mdx mutation (supplemental Table S1). The molecular function of APOBEC2 is not known, but based on sequence homology to other members of the AID/APOBEC family, it has been proposed to be a nucleic acid-editing enzyme. The AID and APOBEC3 proteins function physiologically as DNA editors, and their DNA deaminase activity can be sensitively monitored in a bacterial mutation assay (20.Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Harris R.S. Neuberger M.S. Nature. 2002; 418: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 21.Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Previous studies have failed to identify any DNA mutator or deaminase activity associated with APOBEC2 (9.Mikl M.C. Watt I.N. Lu M. Reik W. Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S. Rada C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7270-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21.Harris R.S. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Neuberger M.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1247-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar); it is unlikely therefore to be a DNA-editing enzyme. Testing for a possible RNA-editing activity is more difficult, especially in the absence of any informed speculation concerning the possible target RNA. However, all RNA-editing enzymes identified to date either bind RNA or associate with an RNA-binding partner; we therefore asked whether APOBEC2 shares either of these attributes. Analysis of APOBEC2 that had been modified by the addition of a One-STrEP peptide tag (13.Junttila M.R. Saarinen S. Schmidt T. Kast J. Westermarck J. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1199-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and pulled down from transfected mouse C2C12 myoblast cells did not reveal any high stoichiometry-associated protein: the most abundantly co-purified protein (present at 5% of the APOBEC2 band) was revealed by mass spectrometric analysis to be actin, which was also found in the pulldown from the untransfected control (data not shown). Western blot analysis of extracts prepared from mouse gastrocnemius muscle revealed that APOBEC2 was present in the soluble fraction; gel filtration of the extract on a calibrated fast protein liquid chromatography column yielded a single peak of APOBEC2 protein, eluting with a molecular mass of 100–124 kDa (Fig. 8A). Extensive pretreatment with RNase A did not affect the APOBEC2 gel filtration profile. Thus, it appears most likely that APOBEC2 is present in muscle as a soluble homotetramer without any tightly high stoichiometry-associated protein. This is consistent with the fact that N-terminally truncated recombinant APOBEC2 purified from E. coli crystallizes as a homotetramer (6.Prochnow C. Bransteitter R. Klein M.G. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2007; 445: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We were interested in determining whether APOBEC2, like APOBEC1 and APOBEC3 family members (14.Navaratnam N. Shah R. Patel D. Fay V. Scott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22.Jarmuz A. Chester A. Bayliss J. Gisbourne J. Dunham I. Scott J. Navaratnam N. Genomics. 2002; 79: 285-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), could bind to RNA. Recombinant MBP-APOBEC1 and MBP-APOBEC2 were compared in their ability to bind radiolabeled oligonucleotide RNA substrates (both the minimal APOBEC1-binding sequence of apoB RNA and AU repeat RNA) in UV cross-linking experiments. Although strong cross-linking of both the AU repeat sequence and the apoB sequence could be detected with MBP-APOBEC1, no such strong binding could be detected with MBP-APOBEC2 (Fig. 8B). The APOBEC2 gene is found in all vertebrates so far investigated, with its expression being largely restricted to striated muscle. Here, we have shown that, although found in all skeletal muscle types and myofibers examined, high levels of APOBEC2 are especially associated with slow muscle and, within soleus muscle, with slow as opposed to fast muscle myofibers. Curiously, however, we found that a deficiency in APOBEC2 actually results in an increase (rather than a decrease) in the proportion of slow fibers in soleus muscle, an observation that is consistent with the finding that denervation (which causes a fast-to-slow myosin HC shift) is also accompanied by a reduction in APOBEC2 expression. These results suggest that, although APOBEC2 is likely to largely function in slow muscle (because that is where it is predominantly expressed), it cannot be essential for the specification of slow fibers (because the proportion of slow fibers is actually increased in the soleus muscle of APOBEC2-deficient mice). An obvious conundrum presented by our findings is why, if APOBEC2 is largely expressed in slow muscle, should APOBEC2 deficiency then result in a fast-to-slow fiber-type shift in soleus muscle. Several possible explanations can be envisioned. One is that APOBEC2 deficiency leads to an inadequacy/defect in slow muscle and that the fiber-type shift is then triggered to achieve some form of compensation. Another possibility is that APOBEC2 is somehow implicated in the turnover of slow myofibers. Indeed, skeletal muscle mass is determined by dynamic balance of synthesis and degradation of muscle proteins, with muscle mass, fiber size, and fiber composition being normally regulated in response to changes in physical stimuli, nutrition, and pathological conditions (19.Sato Y. Shimizu M. Mizunoya W. Wariishi H. Tatsumi R. Buchman V.L. Ikeuchi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2009; 73: 1749-1756Google Scholar, 23.Arany Z. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although reduced muscle mass and a fiber-type switch are already evident in young mice, histological evidence of myopathy (an increased proportion of newly generated fibers as judged by fiber size and the presence of centrally located nuclei) only becomes evident in older mice. Interestingly, others have noted increased APOBEC2 abundance in the muscles of aging rats (24.Piec I. Listrat A. Alliot J. Chambon C. Taylor R.G. Bechet D. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1143-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Maybe this increase in APOBEC2 expression with age could reflect other changes in muscle characteristics such as turnover of muscle proteins or shift in fiber type, although this remains to be determined. Based on it structural homology to APOBEC1, APOBEC2 has widely been presumed to be an RNA-editing enzyme. Similar considerations led others to assume that the lymphocyte-specific AID protein (another member of the AID/APOBEC family) would also prove to be an RNA-editing enzyme (25.Muramatsu M. Kinoshita K. Fagarasan S. Yamada S. Shinkai Y. Honjo T. Cell. 2000; 102: 553-563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2642) Google Scholar). However, the discovery that AID instead functions as a DNA deaminase (26.Neuberger M.S. Harris R.S. Di Noia J. Petersen-Mahrt S.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 305-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) contributed to more recent speculation that APOBEC2 might act on DNA (27.Rai K. Huggins I.J. James S.R. Karpf A.R. Jones D.A. Cairns B.R. Cell. 2008; 135: 1201-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). However, we remain somewhat skeptical as to whether APOBEC2 functions as a polynucleotide deaminase at all. We have previously demonstrated that a cytidine deaminase activity that was previously assigned to recombinant APOBEC2 is most likely attributable to bacterial deaminases contaminating the recombinant APOBEC2 preparation (9.Mikl M.C. Watt I.N. Lu M. Reik W. Davies S.L. Neuberger M.S. Rada C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 7270-7277Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Not only did we find no mutator activity associated with APOBEC2 (such activity might be expected for a DNA deaminase), we also found no evidence of an affinity for RNA or high stoichiometry association with a partner, either of which is usually associated with RNA-editing enzymes. The proposition that APOBEC2 does not function as a polynucleotide deaminase is consistent with the APOBEC2 amino acid sequence because it lacks conserved regions that have been shown to be important for deaminase activity in other APOBEC family members, e.g. the tryptophan residue adjacent to the zinc coordination motif (28.Chen K.M. Martemyanova N. Lu Y. Shindo K. Matsuo H. Harris R.S. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4761-4766Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 29.Holden L.G. Prochnow C. Chang Y.P. Bransteitter R. Chelico L.

Matsuo H. Nature. 2008; 452: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Furthermore, comparison of the fragment crystal structures of APOBEC2 and APOBEC3G highlights differences surrounding the active site that may account for differences in substrate interactions (29.Holden L.G. Prochnow C. Chang Y.P. Bransteitter R. Chelico L. Sen U. Stevens R.C. Goodman M.F. Chen X.S. Nature. 2008; 456: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, APOBEC2 may deaminate a substrate other than a polynucleotide, or the possibility even remains that it might fulfill some structural role without displaying any deaminase activity at all. Such a structural role has indeed been proposed for some of the individual APOBEC domains found within multidomain APOBEC3 deaminases (reviewed in Ref. 3.Conticello S.G. Genome Biol. 2008; 9: 229Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1986510342,"Methylation of the arginine residues of histones by methyltransferases has important consequences for chromatin structure and gene regulation; however, the molecular mechanism(s) of methyltransferase regulation is still unclear, as is the biological significance of methylation at particular arginine residues. Here, we report a novel specific inhibitor of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1; also known as PRMT4) that selectively inhibits methylation at arginine 17 of histone H3 (H3R17). Remarkably, this plant-derived inhibitor, called TBBD (ellagic acid), binds to the substrate (histone) preferentially at the signature motif, ""KAPRK,"" where the proline residue (Pro-16) plays a critical role for interaction and subsequent enzyme inhibition. In a promoter-specific context, inhibition of H3R17 methylation represses expression of p21, a p53-responsive gene, thus implicating a possible role for H3 Arg-17 methylation in tumor suppressor function. These data establish TBBD as a novel specific inhibitor of arginine methylation and demonstrate substrate sequence-directed inhibition of enzyme activity by a small molecule and its physiological consequence."
https://openalex.org/W2130615340,"There is a body of evidence suggesting that Ca(2+) handling proteins assemble into signaling complexes required for a fine regulation of Ca(2+) signals, events that regulate a variety of critical cellular processes. Canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) and Orai proteins have both been proposed to form Ca(2+)-permeable channels mediating Ca(2+) entry upon agonist stimulation. A number of studies have demonstrated that inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP(3)Rs) interact with plasma membrane TRPC channels; however, at present there is no evidence supporting the interaction between Orai proteins and IP(3)Rs. Here we report that treatment with thapsigargin or cellular agonists results in association of Orai1 with types I and II IP(3)Rs. In addition, we have found that TRPC3, RACK1 (receptor for activated protein kinase C-1), and STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) interact with Orai1 upon stimulation with agonists. TRPC3 expression silencing prevented both the interaction of Orai1 with TRPC3 and, more interestingly, the association of Orai1 with the type I IP(3)R, but not with the type II IP(3)R, thus suggesting that TRPC3 selectively mediates interaction between Orai1 and type I IP(3)R. In addition, TRPC3 expression silencing attenuated ATP- and CCh-stimulated interaction between RACK1 and the type I IP(3)R, as well as Ca(2+) release and entry. In conclusion, our results indicate that agonist stimulation results in the formation of an Orai1-STIM1-TRPC3-RACK1-type I IP(3)R complex, where TRPC3 plays a central role. This Ca(2+) signaling complex might be important for both agonist-induced Ca(2+) release and entry."

The authors report that lesions of the this region do not immediately disrupt vocal behavior but do prevent the development of stable vocal sequences and the ability to imitate vocal sounds. The cortical nucleus LMAN (lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium) provides the output of a basal ganglia pathway that is necessary for vocal learning in juvenile songbirds. The shell subregion of LMAN (LMANshell) gives rise to recurrent loops that may subserve specific learning-related functions. We found that lesions in the LMANshell pathway caused no immediate disruption of vocal behavior, but prevented the development of stable vocal sequences and the ability to imitate vocal sounds."
https://openalex.org/W2101901224,"After the initial discovery of human telomerase deficiency in the X-linked form of the bone marrow failure syndrome dyskeratosis congenita, mutations in genes encoding telomerase subunits have been identified in patients with a wide spectrum of disorders. Structure/function studies of disease-linked variants of human telomerase RNA (hTR) or telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) have exploited in vitro reconstitution of the enzyme catalytic core and/or a PCR-amplified activity assay readout that would not reflect alterations of cellular RNP assembly efficiency, telomeric primer recognition, and/or repeat addition processivity. Here we used telomerase reconstitution in vivo and direct telomeric-repeat primer extension activity assays to compare the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) assembly and activity properties of disease-linked subunit variants in holoenzyme context. Analysis of a large panel of hTR variants revealed numerous biochemical mechanisms for telomerase loss of function, including reduced association of hTR with TERT, reduced RNP catalytic activity, or loss in fidelity of telomeric repeat synthesis. An absolute correlation exists between hTR loss of function and hematopoietic deficiency, but there is no readily apparent telomerase deficiency imposed by an hTR variant linked to pulmonary fibrosis. Some disease-linked TERT variants have altered properties of holoenzyme assembly or repeat addition processivity, but other TERT variants linked to either pulmonary fibrosis or hematopoietic deficiency retained normal hTR interaction and RNP catalytic activity. Combined with additional hTR structure/function studies, our results establish a new resolution of insight into hTR structural requirements for hTR-TERT interaction and for the catalytic cycle of human telomerase holoenzyme.

Telomerase accomplishes de novo telomeric repeat synthesis using an active site constituted by telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA (TER). Association of human TER (hTR) and human TERT in vitro requires chaperone activities (5Holt S.E. Aisner D.L. Baur J. Tesmer V.M. Dy M. Ouellette M. Trager J.B. Morin G.B. Toft D.O. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. White M.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), as first shown for reconstitution of the minimal RNP by subunit expression in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL). In vivo assembly of a stable RNP containing hTR and regulated association of this RNP with TERT to form the biologically active telomerase holoenzyme involve cascades of hTR processing and modification, RNP maturation, nuclear trafficking, and other events that are only partially understood (6Collins K. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2008; 129: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar).Motifs within the mature 451-nucleotide hTR have been defined as required for in vivo accumulation of biologically stable RNP or for association of this catalytically inactive RNP with TERT. Accumulation of hTR depends on a hairpin-hinge-hairpin-ACA (H/ACA) motif in the 3′ half of hTR (Fig. 1A), a motif shared by hTR and a family of RNAs that guide pseudouridine formation by small nucleolar and small Cajal body RNPs (7Mitchell J.R.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The H/ACA motif recruits the interacting protein complex of dyskerin, NHP2, NOP10, and GAR1, all of which are protein components of purified telomerase holoenzyme (9Fu D. Collins K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 773-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). All known vertebrate TERs possess an H/ACA motif (10Chen J.L. Blasco M.A. Greider C.W.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Beyond the H/ACA motif, interaction of a human telomerase RNP with TERT involves two other hTR regions (Fig. 1A); that is, the 5′ half of the RNA (containing the template and pseudoknot) and vertebrate TER conserved region (CR) 4/5 (an extension of the H/ACA motif 5′ stem). These two regions of hTR independently have specific interaction with TERT in vivo and, if combined with TERT in heterologous extract such as RRL, reconstitute a minimal catalytic core of human telomerase (13Mitchell J.R. Collins K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 361-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar).The connection between telomerase deficiency and human disease was established in studies of X-linked dyskeratosis congenita (DC), in which amino acid substitutions of the telomerase holoenzyme H/ACA motif-binding protein dyskerin impose a reduced accumulation of telomerase RNP (7Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 14Collins K. Mitchell J.R. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 564-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). X-linked DC symptoms include a fatal loss of hematopoietic renewal and, with varying penetrance, other hallmarks of proliferative deficiency such as reticulated skin pigmentation and nail dystrophy (15Dokal I. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). X-linked DC patient fibroblasts, lymphoblasts, and lymphocytes monoallelically express variant dyskerin and show steady-state levels of hTR that are ∼20–40% that of the level of hTR accumulation in family-matched control cells (7Mitchell J.R. Cheng J. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 16Wong J.M. Kyasa M.J. Hutchins L. Collins K. Hum. Genet. 2004; 115: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies of autosomal dominant (AD) DC revealed that in several families, disease phenotypes co-segregate with heterozygous inheritance of a chromosome region including a variant allele of hTR (17Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Goldman F. Dearlove A. Bessler M. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Nature. 2001; 413: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). For several hTR substitution or deletion variants linked to AD DC by co-inheritance of allele and disease across an extended family, hTR loss of function is predicted to be ∼50%, based on assays of hTR accumulation and the lack of dominant-negative impact of AD DC hTR on function of the co-expressed wild-type hTR in telomere maintenance (18Westin E.R. Chavez E. Lee K.M. Gourronc F.A. Riley S. Lansdorp P.M. Goldman F.D. Klingelhutz A.J. Aging Cell. 2007; 6: 383-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Errington T.M. Fu D. Wong J.M. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6510-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A less severe loss of hTR function in AD versus X-linked DC is consistent with the later age of disease onset, although disease anticipation in successive generations of AD DC families can erase this distinction (20Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Szydlo R. Walne A. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). For DC patients it is a combination of inherited telomere length deficiency, telomerase deficiency, and individual tissue proliferative history that together would give rise to the critical telomere shortening tightly correlated with clinical presentation of disease (21Wong J.M. Collins K. Lancet. 2003; 362: 983-988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Savage S.A. Alter B.P. Mech.

Genet. 2009; 10: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Recent studies have used a candidate sequencing approach to broaden the potential connection between human telomerase deficiency and disease (22Savage S.A. Alter B.P. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2008; 129: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Armanios M. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 24Calado R.T. Young N.S. Blood. 2008; 111: 4446-4455Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 25Vulliamy T.J. Dokal I. Biochimie. 2008; 90: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Beyond DC, mutations that change the sequence of hTR have been detected in patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia (AA) or myelodysplasia (MDS) and also in a patient diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) without a hematopoietic deficit. This spectrum of clinical defects may be linked (23Armanios M. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Indeed, DC patients are at increased risk for pulmonary disease (15Dokal I. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, because patients presenting with PF or AA or other hallmarks of proliferative deficiency may not be screened for the full complement of potentially telomere-linked disorders, it is difficult to gauge the extent of clinical overlap between syndromes. TERT gene mutations have been detected primarily in patients with PF, autosomal recessive DC, or AD DC (diagnosis typically based on the criteria of bone marrow failure), or mixed PF and anemia (individual members of an extended family show either pulmonary disease or anemia). Apparently less frequent mutations have been reported in genes encoding the H/ACA motif-binding proteins NHP2 and NOP10 or the telomere-binding protein TIN2 (22Savage S.A. Alter B.P. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2008; 129: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Armanios M. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Despite the appeal of a broad connection between telomerase holoenzyme subunit mutations and clinically severe proliferative deficiencies, for TERT mutations in particular, there is often not a strict linkage of the inherited mutation and disease. Many TERT gene mutations linked to PF or autosomal recessive DC may be more accurately viewed as associated with risk of disease rather than disease outright, because they do not strictly co-segregate with disease among family members (26Armanios M.Y. Chen J.J. Cogan J.D. Alder J.K. Ingersoll R.G. Markin C. Lawson W.E. Xie M. Vulto I. Phillips 3rd, J.A. Lansdorp P.M. Greider C.W. Loyd J.E. N. Engl. J.

Dis. 2005; 34: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast to the case for these TERT gene mutations, hTR gene mutations show apparently robust linkage of mutation and disease in the families analyzed to date. However, across the spectrum of hTR gene mutations, the relationship (if any) between genotype and phenotype is unclear. Apart from mutations that compromise accumulation of properly matured hTR in vivo (18Westin E.R. Chavez E. Lee K.M. Gourronc F.A. Riley S. Lansdorp P.M. Goldman F.D. Klingelhutz A.J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), with resulting haploinsufficiency, little is known about how disease-linked hTR variants impose a loss of function for telomerase catalytic activation. To date, most structure/function studies of disease-linked hTR or TERT variants have exploited in vitro reconstitution of the minimal telomerase catalytic core and/or a PCR-amplified readout of telomerase activity (the TRAP assay) that are not intended to detect potential changes in cellular RNP assembly efficiency, telomeric primer recognition, and/or repeat addition processivity. Telomere maintenance activity has been examined for only three hTR variants accumulated at levels comparable with wild-type hTR; a DC-linked pseudoknot disruption variant (107G→A/108C→G) and template deletion variant (Δ52–55) were both incapable of telomere elongation, whereas an AA-linked variant (72C→G) increased telomere length less than the extent accomplished by wild-type hTR (19Errington T.M. Fu D. Wong J.M. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6510-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Here, using a large set of patient-isolated hTR variants not compromised for accumulation in vivo, we address whether there are mechanisms of telomerase loss of function that correlate specifically to an initial disease diagnosis of DC, AA, MDS, or PF. For comparison, we examined a sampling of TERT variants identified in association with DC, PF, or mixed PF and anemia. Because in vitro reconstitution of hTR and TERT alone does not produce the biologically functional state of telomerase holoenzyme harboring a monomer of hTR, a monomer of TERT, and several H/ACA motif-associated proteins (9Fu D. Collins K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 773-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Errington T.M. Fu D. Wong J.M. Collins K. Mol. Cell.

We used tag-based affinity purification to quantify hTR-TERT interaction and used telomeric-repeat primer extension assays to monitor the catalytic activity of purified RNPs. These unprecedented studies of disease-linked telomerase subunit variants uncover several mechanisms by which variants of hTR impose telomerase deficiency and strengthen the relationship between hTR loss of function and hematopoietic disease. Combined with additional mutagenesis of a functionally critical region of hTR region with ambiguous secondary structure, we refine an overall map of hTR and TERT structural requirements for holoenzyme assembly and catalytic activity.

Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6510-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A less severe loss of hTR function in AD versus X-linked DC is consistent with the later age of disease onset, although disease anticipation in successive generations of AD DC families can erase this distinction (20Vulliamy T. Marrone A. Szydlo R. Walne A. Mason P.J. Dokal I. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 447-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). For DC patients it is a combination of inherited telomere length deficiency, telomerase deficiency, and individual tissue proliferative history that together would give rise to the critical telomere shortening tightly correlated with clinical presentation of disease (21Wong J.M.

Genet. 2009; 10: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Recent studies have used a candidate sequencing approach to broaden the potential connection between human telomerase deficiency and disease (22Savage S.A. Alter B.P. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2008; 129: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Armanios M. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum.

Biochimie. 2008; 90: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Beyond DC, mutations that change the sequence of hTR have been detected in patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia (AA) or myelodysplasia (MDS) and also in a patient diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) without a hematopoietic deficit. This spectrum of clinical defects may be linked (23Armanios M. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Indeed, DC patients are at increased risk for pulmonary disease (15Dokal I. Br. J. Haematol. 2000; 110: 768-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). However, because patients presenting with PF or AA or other hallmarks of proliferative deficiency may not be screened for the full complement of potentially telomere-linked disorders, it is difficult to gauge the extent of clinical overlap between syndromes. TERT gene mutations have been detected primarily in patients with PF, autosomal recessive DC, or AD DC (diagnosis typically based on the criteria of bone marrow failure), or mixed PF and anemia (individual members of an extended family show either pulmonary disease or anemia). Apparently less frequent mutations have been reported in genes encoding the H/ACA motif-binding proteins NHP2 and NOP10 or the telomere-binding protein TIN2 (22Savage S.A. Alter B.P. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2008; 129: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Armanios M. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10: 45-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar).Despite the appeal of a broad connection between telomerase holoenzyme subunit mutations and clinically severe proliferative deficiencies, for TERT mutations in particular, there is often not a strict linkage of the inherited mutation and disease. Many TERT gene mutations linked to PF or autosomal recessive DC may be more accurately viewed as associated with risk of disease rather than disease outright, because they do not strictly co-segregate with disease among family members (26Armanios M.Y. Chen J.J. Cogan J.D. Alder J.K. Ingersoll R.G. Markin C. Lawson W.E. Xie M. Vulto I. Phillips 3rd, J.A. Lansdorp P.M. Greider C.W. Loyd J.E. N. Engl. J.

Dis. 2005; 34: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast to the case for these TERT gene mutations, hTR gene mutations show apparently robust linkage of mutation and disease in the families analyzed to date. However, across the spectrum of hTR gene mutations, the relationship (if any) between genotype and phenotype is unclear. Apart from mutations that compromise accumulation of properly matured hTR in vivo (18Westin E.R. Chavez E. Lee K.M. Gourronc F.A. Riley S. Lansdorp P.M. Goldman F.D. Klingelhutz A.J.

Cell. 2003; 11: 1361-1372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), with resulting haploinsufficiency, little is known about how disease-linked hTR variants impose a loss of function for telomerase catalytic activation. To date, most structure/function studies of disease-linked hTR or TERT variants have exploited in vitro reconstitution of the minimal telomerase catalytic core and/or a PCR-amplified readout of telomerase activity (the TRAP assay) that are not intended to detect potential changes in cellular RNP assembly efficiency, telomeric primer recognition, and/or repeat addition processivity. Telomere maintenance activity has been examined for only three hTR variants accumulated at levels comparable with wild-type hTR; a DC-linked pseudoknot disruption variant (107G→A/108C→G) and template deletion variant (Δ52–55) were both incapable of telomere elongation, whereas an AA-linked variant (72C→G) increased telomere length less than the extent accomplished by wild-type hTR (19Errington T.M. Fu D. Wong J.M. Collins K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 6510-6520Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Here, using a large set of patient-isolated hTR variants not compromised for accumulation in vivo, we address whether there are mechanisms of telomerase loss of function that correlate specifically to an initial disease diagnosis of DC, AA, MDS, or PF. For comparison, we examined a sampling of TERT variants identified in association with DC, PF, or mixed PF and anemia. Because in vitro reconstitution of hTR and TERT alone does not produce the biologically functional state of telomerase holoenzyme harboring a monomer of hTR, a monomer of TERT, and several H/ACA motif-associated proteins (9Fu D. Collins K. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 773-785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 19Errington T.M. Fu D. Wong J.M. Collins K. Mol. Cell.

We used tag-based affinity purification to quantify hTR-TERT interaction and used telomeric-repeat primer extension assays to monitor the catalytic activity of purified RNPs. These unprecedented studies of disease-linked telomerase subunit variants uncover several mechanisms by which variants of hTR impose telomerase deficiency and strengthen the relationship between hTR loss of function and hematopoietic disease. Combined with additional mutagenesis of a functionally critical region of hTR region with ambiguous secondary structure, we refine an overall map of hTR and TERT structural requirements for holoenzyme assembly and catalytic activity."

These neuronal treatments induce the dephosphorylation (activation) of ADF/cofilin in neurons in which rods form. Neuronal rods failed to stain with fluorescent derivatives of phalloidin, a mushroom toxin widely used to identify filamentous actin (F-actin) structures (4.Wulf E. Deboben A. Bautz F.A. Faulstich H.

Significantly, brains from perfusion-fixed transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein with familial AD mutations also contain rods (2.Maloney M.T. Minamide L.S. Kinley A.W. Boyle J.A.

Mature rods can completely occlude the neurite, blocking transport and causing distal atrophy and synaptic dysfunction (1.Minamide L.S. Striegl A.M. Boyle J.A. Meberg P.J. Bamburg J.R. Nat.

They were first identified in the nucleus of cultured Dictyostelium and HeLa cells treated with high concentrations of DMSO (10.Fukui Y. Katsumaru H. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 120: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); DMSO-induced rods were later shown to contain cofilin (11.Nishida E. Iida K. Yonezawa N. Koyasu S. Yahara I. Sakai H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 5262-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Actin-containing rods also have been identified in the nucleus of muscle cells of patients with nemaline myopathy (12.Goebel H.H. Warlo I. Neuromuscul. Disord. 1997; 7: 13-19Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Expression in cultured cells of human skeletal muscle actin containing a nemaline myopathy mutation results in formation of nuclear rods, only some of which stain for cofilin (13.Domazetovska A. Ilkovski B. Cooper S.T. Ghoddusi M. Hardeman E.C. Minamide L.S. Gunning P.W. Bamburg J.R. North K.N. Brain. 2007; 130: 3275-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are multiple ways to form rod-shaped actin inclusions with different compositions. Thus, knowing the components of rods is an important step in understanding the mechanism of their formation and in finding ways to inhibit or reverse their formation in neurons before permanent damage ensues. Because actin rod formation in response to a decline in cellular ATP is a general phenomenon that affects a high percentage of many different types of cells (14.Bershadsky A.D. Gelfand V.I. Svitkina T.M. Tint I.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 127: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), including neurons (1.Minamide L.S. Striegl A.M. Boyle J.A. Meberg P.J. Bamburg J.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we utilized ATP depletion to generate large numbers of rods in non-neuronal cells expressing fluorescent ADF/cofilins. Live cell time lapse imaging showed that rods formed rapidly as short needle-like aggregates, which could be blocked from forming with cytochalasin D or jasplakinolide. Electron microscopic tomographic reconstruction of a mature rod demonstrated that it was composed of variable length filaments. We developed an isolation protocol for rods formed from fluorescent proteins and applied it to lysates of cells, including cortical neurons, in which rods were induced without exogenous protein expression. We developed a quantitative sedimentation method to assess stability of rods in response to different agents and applied this to rods made from cofilin-GFP or endogenous proteins. Rod-associated proteins were identified through mass spectrometric analysis of their peptides and quantified by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence methods were used to determine if these proteins were components of rods formed in neurons. Whereas some of these proteins were found associated with mature rods, none other than ADF/cofilin and actin appeared to be necessary to initiate rod formation, a finding confirmed by the in vitro assembly of rods from these purified proteins at physiological concentrations. Porcine proximal tubule LLCPK A4.8 cells (a kind gift of Dr. Bruce Molitoris) were maintained in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 12.5 mm Hepes. Human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. HeLa cells transfected with human cofilin-GFP (15.Huang T.Y. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. Bokoch G.M. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, G418 (500 μg/ml), and penicillin/streptomycin. Drug treatment of cells included latrunculin B (BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), cytochalasin D (Sigma), and jasplakinolide (Invitrogen), each of which was dissolved in DMSO and used at a 1 μg/ml final concentration (1:1000 dilution). Dissociated E18 rat cortical neurons were plated at a density of 2 × 107 neurons on poly-d-lysine-coated 10-cm plastic tissue culture dishes or 15–25,000 neurons on 1.5-cm coated coverslips in neurobasal medium containing B27 supplements, Glutamax (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Two hours after plating, the medium was replaced with serum-free neurobasal medium. All primary cultures and cell lines were maintained at 37 °C at 5% CO2. Four 10-cm dishes of A4.8 cells at 10–15% confluence were each infected 3–4 days prior to harvest with adenovirus expressing Xenopus ADF/cofilin (XAC1) (wild type)-GFP (approximate multiplicity of infection of 200) (16.Meberg P.J. Bamburg J.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 2459-2469Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Minamide L.S. Shaw A.E. Sarmiere P.D. Wiggan O. Maloney M.T. Bernstein B.W. Sneider J.M. Gonzalez J.A. Bamburg J.R. Methods Cell Biol. 2003; 71: 367-394Google Scholar). The cells were washed with 3 × 10 ml of calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then ATP-depleted in 10 mm sodium azide, 6 mm 2-deoxyglucose in PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. Preparations of rods from neurons, A431 cells, and HeLa cells were performed in the presence of nocodazole (supplemental Fig. S1) as described under “Results.” The cells from each dish were scraped into 200 μl of 20 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA (Pipes buffer) at 4 °C and transferred to separate microcentrifuge tubes. Cell lysis and all subsequent steps as described under “Results” were performed at 4 °C. Rods were separated by two gradient centrifugation steps on OptiPrep (Axis-Shield PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) in polyallomer tubes (11 × 34 mm; Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) in a swinging bucket rotor (TLS55) in a TL-100 ultracentrifuge. Samples (10 μl) of rods from the OptiPrep gradients were fixed on ice by the addition of an equal volume of 2% glutaraldehyde in MOPS buffer for 10 min (18.Davis R.C. Furukawa R. Fechheimer M. Acta Neuropathol. 2008; 115: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The fixed rods (5 μl) were applied to a Formvar-coated grid (kept on Parafilm-covered glass on ice) for 10 min, and the excess liquid was wicked off, followed by the addition of a drop of aqueous 1% phosphotungstic acid for 5 min. The phosphotungstic acid was wicked off, and after a quick rinse with a drop of water, the grid was wicked dry and stored at room temperature. Negatively stained samples were viewed on a JEOL 2000 transmission electron microscope operating at 80 keV. A4.8 cells infected with adenovirus for expressing XAC-GFP were grown at 37 °C on 0.7% Formvar-coated 75-mesh gold grids in 95% air, 5% CO2. The cells were ATP-depleted for 30 min in PBS containing 10 mm sodium azide and 6 mm 2-deoxyglucose, fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 45 min, rinsed briefly in PBS, placed in 8% sucrose in PBS, and plunge-frozen and freeze-substituted as previously described (19.Ladinsky M.S. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. Howell K.E. Staehelin L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1135-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells on grids were wicked free of most liquid and plunge-frozen in liquid ethane (−174 °C). Cells on grids were quickly transferred to liquid nitrogen and freeze-substituted into 1% glutaraldehyde in acetone and maintained at −90 °C for 2 days, after which the solution was replaced with a −90 °C solution of 1% osmium tetroxide and 0.1% uranyl acetate. After warming to 4 °C over 24 h, grids with cells were infiltrated with increasing concentrations of Epon-Araldite resin, which was polymerized at 60 °C for 2 days. Areas of well preserved cells identified by phase microscopy were excised and remounted on resin stubs with epoxy adhesive MS-907 (Miller-Stephenson, Morton Grove, IL), and 200-nm sections were collected on 0.7% Formvar-coated copper slot grids, poststained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and imaged in a Tecnai F30 electron microscope operating at 300 kV. Dual axis tomography (20.Mastronarde D.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1997; 120: 343-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar) was used to generate a three-dimensional image from a section of a rod, and computer visualization of the three-dimensional image data was accomplished using the software program IMOD (21.Kremer J.R. Mastronarde D.N. McIntosh J.R. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (3582) Google Scholar). Rod proteins from A431 cells were dissolved in 8 m urea, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, reduced by adding Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine to 5 mm, incubated at 20 °C for 30 min, and then carboxamidomethylated by adding iodoacetamide to 10 mm and incubating at 20 °C for 30 min in the dark. Samples were diluted to 2 m urea with 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, brought to 1 mm CaCl2, and further digested with trypsin by using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:20 overnight at 37 °C. The digestion reaction was quenched by the addition of formic acid to 5%. Rod proteins from neurons were treated similarly, except reduction was with dithiothreitol (DTT), and trypsin digestion was in ammonium bicarbonate buffer. Peptides from the A431 rods were analyzed as follows. A 100-μm inner diameter capillary with a 5-μm pulled tip was packed with 10 cm of 5-μm Aqua C18 material (Phenomenex, Ventura, CA). The desalting column was then equilibrated for 30 min with Buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid), and the protein digest was pressure-loaded onto it. The column was placed inline with an Agilent 1100 quaternary high pressure liquid chromatograph (Palo Alto, CA) and analyzed by using a one-step separation, which consisted of a 120-min gradient from 0 to 100% Buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). As peptides eluted from the microcapillary column, they were electrosprayed directly onto an LTQ mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, Palo Alto, CA) with the application of a distal 2.4-kV spray voltage. A cycle of one full-scan mass spectrum (400–1,400 m/z) was followed by three data-dependent MS/MS spectra at a 35% normalized collision energy. Applications of MS scan functions and high pressure liquid chromatography solvent gradients were controlled by the XCalibur data system. Peptides from the neuronal rods were analyzed similarly by the Proteomics and Metabolomics Facility at Colorado State University. They were purified and concentrated using an on-line enrichment column (Agilent Zorbax C18, 5 μm × 5 μm × 0.3 mm). Subsequent chromatographic separation was performed on a reverse phase nanospray column (Agilent 1100 nanoHPLC, Zorbax C18, 5 μm × 75 μm inner diameter × 150-mm column) using a 42-min linear gradient from 25 to 55% Buffer C (90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Peptides were eluted directly into the Thermo Scientific LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer, and spectra were collected over an m/z range of 200–2000 Da using a dynamic exclusion limit of two MS/MS spectra of a given peptide mass for 30 s (exclusion duration of 90 s). Compound lists of the resulting spectra were generated using Bioworks version 3.0 software (Thermo Scientific) with an intensity threshold of 5,000 and 1 scan/group. Tandem MS spectra of A431 peptides were analyzed by using the following software analysis protocol. Poor quality spectra were removed from the data set by using an automated spectral quality assessment algorithm. Tandem MS spectra remaining after filtering were searched with the SEQUEST algorithm against a human database that was concatenated to a decoy data base in which the sequence for each entry in the original data base was reversed. No enzyme specificity was considered for any search. SEQUEST results were assembled and filtered by using the DTASelect (version 2.0) program. DTASelect 2.0 uses a linear discriminant analysis to dynamically set XCorr and DeltaCN thresholds for the entire data set to achieve a user-specified false positive rate (5% in this analysis). The false positive rates are estimated by the program from the number and quality of spectral matches to the decoy data base. The acquired MS/MS spectra for the neuronal rod peptides were searched against a protein sequence data base (NCBI) using the Mascot (version 2.2.03; Matrix Science (London, UK)) data base search engine. The searches were performed with the following parameters: fragment ion mass tolerance of 1 Da, parent ion tolerance of 2.0 Da, full tryptic digestion, fixed modification of carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. Peptide identification score thresholds were utilized for identification (Mascot ion scores of >30). Protein identifications were accepted if they contained at least one identified peptide; however, all single peptide protein identifications were subjected to additional manual validation, which included identification by immunoblotting of isolated rods. Proteins in the isolated rod fractions were concentrated by precipitation (22.Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3163) Google Scholar) and then solubilized in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Protein samples in 0.25 m Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and bromphenol blue were loaded onto SDS-containing polyacrylamide slab gels (7.5, 10, 12.5, or 15% isocratic) (23.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Western blots (nitrocellulose membrane) were probed with antibodies specific for total ADF and cofilin (rabbit 1439) (24.Shaw A.E. Minamide L.S. Bill C.L. Funk J.D. Maiti S. Bamburg J.R. Electrophoresis. 2004; 25: 2611-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), cofilin (ACFL02, Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO)), actin (clone C4, MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA)), 14-3-3ζ (which also recognizes β and σ isoforms), tropomyosin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), Hsp60 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA), and annexin A2 (ProteinTech Group, Chicago, IL). Bound fluorescent secondary antibodies were detected with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Quantitative measurements from Western blots were performed with Total Lab one-dimensional gel software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Durham, NC). To be within the linear range of the standard curves (supplemental Fig. S2C), different amounts of the same samples were used to quantify actin and the ADF/cofilin or its chimera with GFP. Actin was quantified using the actin monoclonal C4 antibody with purified muscle actin as a standard, whereas different antibodies and standards (see below) were used for the different ADF/cofilin proteins. We tested three different antibodies against human cofilin-GFP: a mouse monoclonal antibody (MAb22) (25.Abe H. Ohshima S. Obinata T. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the rabbit 1439 pan-ADF/cofilin antibody, and a commercial anti-cofilin antibody (ACFL01, Cytoskeleton Inc.), but none of them gave adequate sensitivity to both the cofilin-GFP and the human cofilin standard. Thus, we quantified the human cofilin-GFP/actin ratio in HeLa cell rods from silver-stained gels by comparison with actin and XAC-GST standards (see supplemental Fig. S2C). Cells were fixed for 45 min at room temperature with prewarmed (37 °C) 4% paraformaldehyde with or without 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with methanol (prechilled at −20 °C) for 3 min at room temperature, and blocked in 2% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline before immunostaining. Primary antibodies were the same as used for immunoblotting plus peroxiredoxin 1 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). ProLong Gold Antifade (Invitrogen) was used for the mounting medium. Initially, isolated and fixed rods were allowed to settle on glass coverslips coated with nitrocellulose (10 mg/ml in amyl acetate) and immunostained (see below) but were later sedimented onto ACLAR™ (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) embedding film. ACLAR™ circles (4-mm diameter) were coated with 5 μl of nitrocellulose, allowed to air-dry, and then placed on top of a 70-μl 10% polyacrylamide cushion in microcentrifuge tubes. Isolated rods were diluted 1:1 with Pipes buffer, and then electron microscopy grade formaldehyde (20%; Tousimis (Rockville, MD)) and glutaraldehyde (25%) were added to 2 and 0.1%, respectively. Immediately after the addition of fixative, the rods were overlaid onto the coated ACLAR™ discs and centrifuged in a Beckman Microfuge B at 8,000 × g for 2.5 min at room temperature. Supernatants were discarded, and the discs were transferred to glass slides (rod side up) with each disc encircled with a hydrophobic ring made with a PAP pen (Research Products International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL). The discs were rinsed three times with Pipes buffer, treated with cold 80% methanol, 20% Pipes buffer for 30–60 s, and rinsed three times with Pipes buffer. The discs were blocked with 5% goat serum in 1% bovine serum albumin plus Tris-buffered saline to prevent nonspecific binding of antibodies to the nitrocellulose. Rods were then immunostained with rabbit 1439 antibody to ADF/cofilin, washed, incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody, washed, and mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade onto glass coverslips. Phase-contrast and fluorescence images were obtained on a Nikon Diaphot epifluorescence microscope using ×20 air or ×40 (1.3 numerical aperture) or ×60 (1.40 numerical aperture) oil objectives. Images were captured with a CoolSnap cs chilled CCD camera driven by Metamorph (Molecular Devices, Downingtown, PA) software. Single labeled cells were used to check for bleed-through in all double label immunofluorescence studies, and when necessary, exposure times were adjusted to eliminate any crossover contribution from the fluors. Pseudocolored fluorescence images were overlaid using Metamorph software. Time lapse imaging was performed on cofilin-GFP-expressing HeLa cells in a glass bottom T25 flask mounted on an Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope with a stage incubator maintained at 37 °C. Imaging was performed with a 473 laser line using a spinning disc confocal attachment (CSU22 head) at seven different stage positions in a single focal plane (ASI stage) acquiring images with a ×60 DIC objective (1.45 numerical aperture) at 1-min intervals at each stage position. Images were captured on a Cascade II EMCCD camera with a 1Kx1K chip (Roper Scientific). SlideBook software (3I (Denver, CO)) was used for automated image collection. Chicken muscle actin was purified from muscle acetone powder according to Pardee and Spudich (26.Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar), gel-filtered over Sephadex G-150 in G-buffer, reassembled, and pelleted. The F-actin pellet was resuspended in 2 mm Tris, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 mm ADP; sonicated several times on ice to generate short fragments; and then dialyzed for 48 h at 4 °C against the same buffer. After removing the remaining actin polymer by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h, the supernatant was filter-sterilized and dialyzed against an ADP-Pipes buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 0.2 mm ADP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) overnight. The actin was concentrated to about 3.4 mg/ml (80 μm) on sterile Ultrafree-0.5 centrifugal filters (5 kDa cut-off) (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Recombinant chick ADF (27.Adams M.E. Minamide L.S. Duester G. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7414-7420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and human cofilin (5.McGough A. Pope B. Chiu W. Weeds A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) were purified from bacterial lysates as described by Chen et al. (28.Chen H. Bernstein B.W. Sneider J.M. Boyle J.A. Minamide L.S. Bamburg J.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7127-7142Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The proteins were sterile filtered and aseptically dialyzed overnight in the same ADP-Pipes buffer as actin. The ADF and cofilin were concentrated on Millipore Ultrafree centrifugal filters to a final concentration of about 1.5 mg/ml (80 μm). For some experiments, an equal volume of ADF and actin was mixed, and 5 μl was mixed with the ADP-Pipes buffer containing 20% polyethylene glycol 400, and the drop was suspended over a 24-well crystallization dish containing the ADP-Pipes buffer with 20% polyethylene glycol and 1% sodium azide. The drops were examined every 2 days by dark field microscopy. When fibrous material was observed (about 48 h), the protein from the hanging drop was transferred to a Formvar-coated electron microscopy grid, and material was allowed to adhere for 30 s before wicking off the solution, negatively staining the rods with filtered 1% uranyl acetate, air drying, and observing by transmission electron microscopy on a JEOL 2000 as described above. For other experiments, the actin was supplemented with 1% Alexa 488 actin or 1% Alexa 594 actin (Invitrogen), and an equal volume of actin and either ADF or cofilin were mixed with an assembly buffer containing 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and KCl amounts between 0 and 100 mm. For long term studies, the mixture was suspended as a drop over a well containing ADP-Pipes buffer, and the dish was maintained at room temperature for hours or days before the drop was transferred to a glass slide, covered with a coverslip, and observed by epifluorescence microscopy. For short term studies, the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15–30 min and centrifuged through 5% OptiPrep onto nitrocellulose-coated ACLAR™. Whi"

Crystal structures of EGFR and Her4 kinase domains demonstrate kinase dimerization and activation through an allosteric mechanism. The kinase domains form an asymmetric dimer, where the C-lobe surface of one monomer contacts the N-lobe of the other monomer. EGFR kinase dimerization and activation in vitro was previously reported using a nickel-chelating lipid-liposome system, and we now apply this system to all other members of the EGFR family. Polyhistidine-tagged Her4, Her2/neu, and Her3 kinase domains are bound to these nickel-liposomes and are brought to high local concentration, mimicking what happens to full-length receptors in vivo following ligand binding. Addition of nickel-liposomes to Her4 kinase domain results in 40-fold activation in kinase activity and marked enhancement of C-terminal tail autophosphorylation. Activation of Her4 shows a sigmoidal dependence on kinase concentration, consistent with a cooperative process requiring kinase dimerization. Her2/neu kinase activity is also activated by nickel-liposomes, and is increased further by heterodimerization with Her3 or Her4. The ability of Her3 and Her4 to heterodimerize and activate other family members is studied in vitro. Her3 kinase domain readily activates Her2/neu but is a poor activator of Her4, which differs from the prediction made by the asymmetric dimer model. Mutation of Her3 residues 952ENI954 to the corresponding sequence in Her4 enhanced the ability of Her3 to activate Her4, demonstrating that sequence differences on the C-lobe surface influence the heterodimerization and activation of ErbB kinase domains.

Like amyloid precursor protein and Notch, γ-secretase cleavage of the p75 receptor releases an intracellular domain (ICD). However, it has been experimentally challenging to determine the precise subcellular localization and functional consequences of the p75 ICD. Here, we utilized a nuclear translocation assay and biochemical fractionation approaches to follow the fate of the ICD. We found that the p75 ICD can translocate to the nucleus to activate a green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Furthermore, the p75 ICD was localized in nuclear fractions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that nerve growth factor induced the association of endogenous p75 with the cyclin E1 promoter. Expression of the p75 ICD resulted in modulation of gene expression from this locus. These results suggest that the p75 ICD generated by γ-secretase cleavage is capable of modulating transcriptional events in the nucleus.

These results suggest that the p75 ICD generated by γ-secretase cleavage is capable of modulating transcriptional events in the nucleus. The p75 neurotrophin receptor is the founding member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily that includes the Fas antigen, DR6, CD30, and CD40. This family of receptors is distinguished with multiple cysteine-rich domains for ligand binding, a single transmembrane sequence, and a noncatalytic cytoplasmic domain (1.Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2936) Google Scholar). The intracellular region of the p55 tumor necrosis factor receptor, Fas receptor, and p75 contains a death domain sequence (2.Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The death domain serves as a protein-protein docking site and is required for initiating tumor necrosis factor- and Fas-mediated apoptosis (3.Haase G. Pettmann B. Raoul C. Henderson C.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2008; 18: 284-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The p75 receptor is recognized by all the neurotrophins (NGF, 3The abbreviations used are: NGFnerve growth factorICDintracellular domainPBSphosphate-buffered salineFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterGFPgreen fluorescent proteinCycE1cyclin E1FasRFas receptor. brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4), which promote differentiation, growth, and survival of diverse cell types in the nervous system (4.Huang E.J.

Neurotrophins also initiate signaling through Trk tyrosine kinase receptors, which are capable of forming high affinity binding sites with p75 to potentiate responses at low concentrations of neurotrophins (7.Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. Nature. 1991; 350: 678-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). The precursor form of neurotrophins (proneurotrophins) binds more avidly to p75 than the mature form (8.Lee R. Kermani P. Teng K.K. Hempstead B.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1945-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 9.Chao M.V. Bothwell M. Neuron. 2002; 33: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the absence of Trk receptors, p75 is capable of independent signaling that activates NF-κB, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and the sphingomyelin cycle (10.Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In selected cell types, p75 can initiate cell death (11.Rabizadeh S. Oh J. Zhong L.T.

Alternatively, p75 can serve as a co-receptor for several proteins that modulate axon outgrowth, such as Nogo, neuropilin-1, and plexin-A4 (14.Wang K.C. Kim J.A. Sivasankaran R. Segal R. He Z.

Proteolysis through presenilin-dependent γ-secretase activity has emerged as a highly conserved and prevalent mechanism in receptor signaling responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of important proteins, such as Notch, ErbB4 tyrosine kinase receptors, CD44, low density lipoprotein, and β-amyloid precursor protein (20.Ebinu J.O. Yankner B.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 499-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Inhibition of γ-secretase cleavage of p75 has been shown to prevent apoptosis (21.Kenchappa R.S. Zampieri N. Chao M.V. Barker P.A. Teng H.K. Hempstead B.L. Carter B.D. Neuron. 2006; 50: 219-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The receptor proteolysis was observed in vivo during naturally occurring cell death in the superior cervical ganglia. Moreover, overexpression of the p75 ICD resulted in apoptosis (22.Majdan M.

These results indicate that p75-mediated apoptosis requires γ-secretase-dependent release of its ICD. Also, cleavage of p75 is required for inhibition of neurite outgrowth by myelin-associated glycoprotein with its receptor, Nogo receptor (23.Domeniconi M. Cao Z. Spencer T. Sivasankaran R. Wang K.

A complex between p75 and the Nogo receptor has been proposed to account for the ability of p75 to inhibit axonal regeneration through the action of the p75-interacting protein RhoA. Furthermore, myelin-associated glycoprotein binding to primary neurons induces proteolytic processing of p75 to produce the p75 ICD. Release of RhoA from p75 is involved in its activation, suggesting that the state of the p75 cytoplasmic domain is an important regulatory element. Whether the p75 ICD is directed to the nucleus has been very difficult to determine due to the instability and the exceedingly low levels of the ICD fragment (19.Jung K.M. Tan S. Landman N. Petrova K. Murray S. Lewis R. Kim P.K. Kim D.S. Ryu S.H. Chao M.V. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42161-42169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Although several reports have indicated that the ICD of p75 can be found in the nucleus (25.Frade J.M. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1407-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26.Podlesniy P.

Pathol. 2006; 169: 119-131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it is unclear what biological activities are displayed by the ICD. In this study, we have employed several biochemical approaches and a reporter gene assay to monitor the fate and potential role of the p75 ICD fragment. Compound E, the γ-secretase inhibitor XVIII (catalog no. 565771), leptomycin B, and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone were obtained from Calbiochem. Thymidine was obtained from Sigma, and nocodazole from Tocris. Antibodies against acetylated histone H3K9 and RhoGDI were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. A rabbit polyclonal antibody against the ICD of p75 (antiserum 9992) and its preimmune fraction were generated as described previously (27.Huber L.J. Chao M.V. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Normal rabbit IgG (sc-2027) used as a negative control was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-TAF135 antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences. The LexA-d1EGFP reporter gene was described previously (28.Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A PCR strategy was used to fuse the LexA DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–87)-Gal4 transactivation domain (amino acids 768–881) cassette to the C terminus of the p75 and Fas receptors. The resulting constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) using the KpnI and NotI sites. The plasmid encoding the rat p75 ICD was generated as described previously (35.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I. Cell. 1997; 90: 1052-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing. HEK293 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum or 5% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. HEK293 cells were transfected with the LexA-d1EGFP plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably transfected clones were selected for 3 weeks in the presence of 500 μg/ml of Geneticin (Invitrogen). Resistant clones were expanded and tested for proper responses in the nuclear translocation assay with a Smad3 fusion protein in the presence of human transforming growth factor-β1 (R&D Systems). For transient transfection, HEK293 and HeLa cells were transferred to antibiotic-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum 12 h prior to transfection and then transfected with Lipofectamine 2000. Approximately 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and/or processed as described below. PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 10% horse serum supplemented with 2 mm glutamine. For experiments utilizing PC12-615 (29.Hempstead B.L. Rabin S.J. Kaplan L. Reid S. Parada L.F. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1992; 9: 883-896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), cells were changed to serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 μmclasto-lactacystin β-lactone ∼16 h prior to NGF stimulation. NGF stimulation was performed by the addition of 50 ng of NGF/ml of medium (Harlan Bioproducts) for 3 h prior to harvesting. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed once with cold PBS on ice, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 25 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay. The LexA-d1EGFP-transfected HEK293 subclone R3 was used for these studies. An equal number of 293-R3 cells (4 × 105) were seeded in 6-well plates 1 day before transfection. Cells were transiently transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 using 4 μg of total DNA. A red fluorescent protein construct was cotransfected at a 1:50 ratio to normalize for transfection efficiency. Two days after transfection, cells were trypsinized and resuspended in 800 μl of FACS buffer (0.5% fetal bovine serum in 1× PBS) and stored on ice for FACS analysis. Transfected cells were analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis were performed following electrophoresis on 4–20 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), primary antibodies against specific proteins were used. They included rabbit polyclonal antiserum 9992 against the ICD of p75 (1:2000), the M20 antibody against the ICD of the Fas antigen (1:500; sc-716, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and GFP (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fractionation of PC12-615 cells into cytoplasmic or nuclear fractions was carried out using a well established protocol. Briefly, cells were collected and washed with PBS prior to resuspension in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were allowed to swell on ice for 5 min before Dounce homogenization. The homogenate was centrifuged at 218 × g to separate the cytoplasm from the nuclei. Nuclei were further purified on a 0.25–0.8 m discontinuous sucrose gradient. Nuclei were lysed, and nuclear proteins were released by sonication (6 × 10-s pulses with a Branson Model S-450D Sonifier, output of 30%) on ice. The total protein concentration of each fraction was determined by the Bradford assay, and equal amounts of protein were analyzed by Western blotting. Fractionation of HEK293 cells was carried out in accordance with the protocol published by Méndez and Stillman (30.Méndez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and washed once with ice-cold PBS before resuspension in ice-cold buffer B (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 340 mm sucrose, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Following an 8-min incubation on ice, nuclei were collected by centrifugation (P1) at 1300 × g for 5 min. A clarified supernatant fraction (S2) was obtained by centrifugation of the supernatant fraction (S1) at 16,000 rpm at for 15 min 4 °C. The P1 fraction was washed with buffer B, resuspended in buffer C (3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as listed above), and incubated on an orbital shaker at 4 °C for 30 min. Soluble (S3) and insoluble (P3) fractions were obtained by centrifugation at 1700 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and P3 was resuspended in buffer C and sonicated with a Branson Model S-450D Sonifier fitted with a microtip to solubilize the chromatin fraction. Equal proportions of each fraction based on volume were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by immunoblotting. Densitometry was performed by high resolution scanning of autoradiography film, followed by quantification with ImageJ. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously (31.Takahashi Y. Rayman J.B. Dynlacht B.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 804-816PubMed Google Scholar) with further modifications. A formaldehyde solution (11% formaldehyde, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Hepes, pH 8) was added directly to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1%, and cells were incubated with gentle agitation at room temperature for 5 min. Cross-linking was inhibited by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m and incubation at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation, and the pellet was resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer 1 (1 ml/10-cm plate; 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors), followed by a 10-min incubation at 4 °C. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation, and the nuclear pellet was resuspended in 8 ml of lysis buffer 2 (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and protease inhibitors) and rocked at room temperature for 10 min. Following centrifugation, chromatin pellets were resuspended in 3 ml of lysis buffer 3 (1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8) and sonicated with a Branson Model S-450D Sonifier fitted with a microtip continuously for 10 min in a dry ice/ethanol bath to an average length of 500 bp. Sheared chromatin (25 μg/immunoprecipitation) was precleared with a 50% slurry of a 1:1 mixture of protein A/G beads (Roche Applied Science) that had been blocked in 1 mg/ml IgG-free bovine serum albumin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 3 h at 4 °C. Specific immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C overnight with rocking. Immune complexes were collected by the addition of 20 μl of protein A/G beads for 3 h. The beads were then washed three times with 140 mm NaCl, twice with 500 mm NaCl, twice with 250 mm LiCl, and three times with 1 mm Tris and 10 mm EDTA. After the addition of Tris/EDTA containing 0.5% SDS, 200 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma), and 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Applied Science), samples were incubated at 55 °C for 3 h, followed by an overnight incubation at 65 °C. The samples were then extracted with phenol/chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 20 μg of glycogen (Roche Applied Science). The precipitated DNA was resuspended in Tris/EDTA buffer for analysis by PCR. PCR was performed using standard reactions with 5 μl of immunoprecipitated material as a template. PCR conditions (40 total cycles) were used, which allowed products to remain within a linear range for comparison. Following amplification, PCR products were run on a 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. For rat (PC12) amplicons, the following sequences were used: CycE1 upstream control region, 5′-TGGGAAGGCATTCTGAAGCAC-3′ and 5′-GGTTGGGAGAGGATTGAGATTGC-3′ (T = 57 °C); and CycE1 promoter, 5′-GCAGGACACGCCCATATTAG-3′ and 5′-CTACACCGCGCTAGCTGTC-3′ (T = 61 °C). HeLa cells transfected with either control or p75 ICD-expressing plasmids were allowed to recover for 4 h after transfection, followed by the addition of 2 mm thymidine. Cells were incubated with thymidine for 16 h, washed extensively with PBS, and allowed to cycle for 4 h in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium before the addition of nocodazole (10 μg/ml). After 12 h of additional incubation, mitotic cells were collected and extensively washed before replating. Samples were collected at 0, 3, and 6 h after cell cycle block release, and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The total RNA was treated to remove contaminating DNA (Turbo DNase removal kit, Ambion) before reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA (Transcriptor cDNA synthesis kit, Roche Applied Science). Quantitative PCR was performed using the Opticon 2 quantitative thermal cycler (MJ Research) and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The following primers were used for PCR amplification: human CycE1, 5′-GTGGTGCGACATAGAGAACTG-3′ and 5′-CGCTGCTCTGCTTCTTACC-3′; and human β-actin, 5′-GAGGCCCAGAGCAAGAGAGG-3′ and 5′- GTACTTGCGCTCAGGAGGAGC-3′. Cleavage of the full-length p75 neurotrophin receptor releases the extracellular domain from a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment. The C-terminal fragment is subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase to give rise to the soluble p75 ICD (18.Kanning K.C. Hudson M. Amieux P.S. Wiley J.C. Bothwell M. Schecterson L.C. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Jung K.M. Tan S. Landman N. Petrova K. Murray S. Lewis R. Kim P.K. Kim D.S. Ryu S.H. Chao M.V. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42161-42169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine whether p75 is directly involved in nuclear signaling, we used a reporter gene assay to detect nuclear translocation events. A protein sequence containing the LexA DNA-binding domain with a Gal4 transactivation domain (referred to as LG) was fused to the p75 C-terminal domain. The LG sequences are capable of directly activating a GFP reporter gene controlled by eight LexA operator sequences (28.Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32.Hoshino A. Fujii H. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2007; 12: 186-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Nuclear translocation is required to transactivate the LexA operator sites of the reporter gene. The translocation and transactivation events were documented previously for several nuclear proteins (28.Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33.Hoshino A. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17706-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Activation of the GFP reporter gene can be monitored by FACS analysis, fluorescent microscopy, and Western blot analysis. We constructed LG fusion proteins for the p75 receptor (p75-LG) and also the Fas receptor (FasR-LG). A HEK293 cell line stably transfected with the GFP reporter gene was generated (293-R3) and used to analyze these proteins (Fig. 1A). Previous studies indicated that this assay can efficiently detect the nuclear translocation of Smad3 after transforming growth factor-β stimulation (28.Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Accordingly, when we transiently transfected a Smad3-LG fusion protein in 293-R3 cells, we found a significant increase in the number of GFP-expressing cells after treatment with transforming growth factor-β (data not shown). Moreover, transfection of the LG cassette did not induce GFP expression. Nuclear translocation of the LG fusion protein is therefore necessary for activation of the reporter gene in this system (28.Hoshino A. Matsumura S. Kondo K. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 153-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33.Hoshino A. Hirst J.A. Fujii H. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17706-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The p75-LG fusion protein was transiently transfected in 293-R3 cells to detect nuclear translocation events. The FasR-LG construct was used as a negative control because FasR is structurally related to p75 but does not undergo proteolytic processing, such as α- and γ-secretase cleavages (34.Zampieri N. Xu C.F. Neubert T.A. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14563-14571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After transfection of p75-LG, GFP expression was induced in a significant population of cells detected by FACS analysis. In contrast, transfection of FasR-LG did not promote GFP expression (Fig. 1, B and C). Western blot analysis indicated that both the FasR-LG and p75-LG proteins were appropriately expressed in 293-R3 cells (Fig. 2A). Fusion with the LG sequences did not interfere with p75 biosynthesis and proteolytic processing. In fact, generation of the p75 ICD from full-length p75-LG was sensitive to the γ-secretase inhibitor compound E. Upon γ-secretase inhibition, we promptly observed the accumulation of an ∼50-kDa band corresponding to the membrane-bound C-terminal fragment-LG fusion protein (Fig. 2A). No cleavage product was observed for the FasR-LG construct (Fig. 2A). Analysis of GFP protein expression by Western blot analysis confirmed that p75-LG induced high levels of GFP expression in 293-R3 cells (Fig. 2B), whereas FasR-LG-transfected cells did not express GFP. The nuclear translocation assay provides evidence that p75 sequences can be directed to the nuclear compartment. To confirm these findings, we analyzed the localization of endogenous p75 in PC12 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Under control conditions, we found, as expected, that p75 was localized to the cell surface and in the cytosol (Fig. 3). Upon treatment with leptomycin B, a potent nuclear protein export inhibitor (35.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I. Cell. 1997; 90: 1052-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), a detectable amount of p75 could be observed in the nucleus. Interestingly, nuclear accumulation could be blocked by treatment with inhibitor X, a γ-secretase inhibitor, suggesting that p75 proteolytic processing and subsequent p75 ICD production are necessary for nuclear translocation. To further investigate p75 ICD nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, we conducted cell fractionation experiments in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a p75 ICD construct. The p75 ICD was found in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions as assessed by the localization of the nuclear specific protein TAF135 and the cytoplasmic restricted protein RhoGDI (36.Chittka A. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 10705-10710Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we observed a significant proportion of the nuclear p75 ICD to be located with a chromatin-enriched fraction (Fig. 4, A and B). Cell fractionation experiments performed in PC12 cells confirmed these results for the endogenous p75 ICD protein. Endogenously generated p75 ICD was present in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions (Fig. 4C). Localization of a nuclear protein (H3K9) and a cytoplasmic protein (RhoGDI) was assessed to control for the specificity of the fractionation procedure. The results of this set of experiments show that the p75 ICD can translocate into the nucleus, specifically within a chromatin-enriched fraction, and that nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling is dependent upon p75 cleavage by γ-secretase. A number of proteins have been found to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of p75. They include SC-1 (36.Chittka A. Chao M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 10705-10710Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), RhoA (37.Yamashita T. Tucker K.L. Barde Y.A. Neuron. 1999; 24: 585-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and TRAF6 (38.Khursigara G. Orlinick J.R. Chao M.V. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2009; 108: 216-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, several p75-interacting proteins, such as NRIF (neurotrophin receptor-interacting factor) (21.Kenchappa R.S. Zampieri N. Chao M.V. Barker P.A. Teng H.K. Hempstead B.L. Carter B.D. Neuron. 2006; 50: 219-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), NADE (p75NTR-associated cell death executor) (40.Mukai J. Hachiya T. Shoji-Hoshino S. Kimura M.T. Nadano D. Suvanto P. Hanaoka T. Li Y. Ire S. Greene L.A. Sato T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17566-17570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and NRAGE (neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE homolog) (41.Salehi A.H. Xanthoudakis S. Barker P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48043-48050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), contribute to apoptosis in immortalized cell lines. Each protein binds to separate domains in the cytoplasmic domain of the p75 receptor. Of particular interest is SC-1, a zinc finger protein that has been localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. A principal function of SC-1 is to regulate growth arrest though modulation of cyclin E gene expression (42.Chittka A. Arevalo J.C. Rodriguez-Guzman M. Pérez P. Chao M.V. Sendtner M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To determine whether endogenously expressed p75 can also be detected at the CycE1 promoter region, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments in PC12 cells. After treatment with NGF for 3 h and immunoprecipitation with an antibody (9992) against the ICD of p75 (27.Huber L.J. Chao M.V. Dev. Biol. 1995; 167: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), we could detect p75 bound to the CycE1 promoter region (−213 to +23 of the transcriptional start site). In contrast, we were unable to detect p75 either in untreated cells or at an upstream control region (−6058 to −5855 from the transcriptional start site of CycE1) (Fig. 5). In addition, no signal could be detected from material precipitated with a preimmune fraction of the anti-p75 antibody (9992), rabbit IgG, or protein A/G beads alone, showing that the detected signal was specific to the anti-p75 antibody. Taken together, these results and the biochemical fractionation (Fig. 4) indicate that p75 can be found in a nuclear fraction and specifically interacts with a known transcriptional target of a p75-interacting protein (42.Chittka A. Arevalo J.C. Rodriguez-Guzman M. Pérez P. Chao M.V. Sendtner M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because we were able to detect p75 at the CycE1 promoter, we next asked whether the p75 ICD might have any effect on CycE1 gene expression. We used HeLa cells for these experiments because they can be easily and reproducibly synchronized by thymidine/nocodazole block. HeLa cells were transfected either with empty vector or with a plasmid expressing the p75 ICD and synchronized by thymidine/nocodazole-induced cell cycle arrest. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis of total RNA indicated that the levels of CycE1 mRNA were significantly decreased in p75 ICD-expressing cells 6 h after cell cycle block release (Fig. 6). This finding is consistent with a previous study showing that expression of the p75 interaction partner SC-1 represses transcription of CycE1 in serum withdrawal-synchronized 3T3 cells (42.Chittka A. Arevalo J.C. Rodriguez-Guzman M. Pérez P. Chao M.V. Sendtner M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is a conserved mechanism that has been proposed to regulate intracellular signaling events. Because many transmembrane proteins undergo γ-secretase cleavage, one prevailing explanation is that these proteolytic events are designed to remove and degrade proteins from the cell surface. An alternative view is that the ICD sequences, once released from the plasma membrane, may have important functions in a different subcellular compartment, such as the cytoplasm and/or the nucleus. In this work, we have demonstrated that the p75 ICD is capable of translocating into the nucleus, where it can activate gene expression of a heterologous gene encoding GFP. Moreover, the p75 ICD can be detected in nuclear fractions and is capable of interacting with the CycE1 promoter and modulating its gene expression. Our data suggest that the p75 receptor may employ regulated intramembrane proteolysis to transmit an intracellular signal. Similar to the cleavage of Notch, the p75 ICD may function as a nuclear transcriptional modulator. The ICDs that result from γ-secretase cleavage of Notch appear to act as nuclear signaling proteins (43.Fortini M.E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 44.Weinmaster G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For example, the p75 ICD may activate a set of genes that are involved in cell death or alternatively modulate genes that are associated with neuronal differentiation. Cleavage of p75 by regulated intramembrane proteolysis is of particular importance for a number of reasons. The ICD of p75 has the potential of binding many intracellular proteins, including TRAF6, SC-1, NADE, NRAGE, and RhoA (6.Barker P.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 529-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The p75 cytoplasmic domain may bring these proteins to function in different cellular compartments. Alternatively, p75 may interact with proteins possessing defined nuclear localization signals, such as importin-β, that might act to shuttle the p75 ICD into the nucleus (45.Hanz S. Perlson E. Willis D. Zheng J.Q. Massarwa R. Huerta J.J. Koltzenburg M. Kohler M. van Minnen J. Twiss J.L. Fainzilber M. Neuron. 2003; 40: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the C-terminal fragment also gives rise to a small peptide whose significance is unknown, but it is analogous to the amyloid-β peptides generated from amyloid precursor protein. Another compelling reason that p75 cleavage is important is that many cell types up-regulate p75 receptors under pathological or inflammatory conditions. For example, after seizures of adult rats, there is prominent expression of p75 in cortical neurons (46.Roux P. Colicos M.A. Barker P.A. Kennedy T.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6887-6896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which normally do not express this receptor. Moreover, induction of p75 has been observed in many cell types, including oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, microglia, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells (5.Chao M.V. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1671) Google Scholar, 6.Barker P.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 529-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here, we have used immortalized cell lines rather than primary neurons because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient materials for analysis and the inherent problems in detecting the fate of the cleaved ICD fragment. Despite these reservations, the results indicate that the p75 receptor is capable of nuclear localization and modulation of transcriptional activity. The increase in binding of endogenous p75 to the CycE1 promoter after NGF treatment (Fig. 5) implies that other target genes may also be affected by p75. A number of experiments point to potentially important biological implications of p75 cleavage. Recent studies of malignant gliomas found that inhibition of γ-secretase cleavage of p75 results in a decrease in glioma invasion and an increase in survival (47.Wang L. Rahn J.J. Lun X. Sun B. Kelly J.J. Weiss S. Robbins S.M. Forsyth P.A. Senger D.L. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e289Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In this case, generation of the ICD in glioma cells produces a more invasive phenotype, suggesting that there are changes in gene expression as a result of p75 cleavage. The p75 receptor has also been implicated in amyloid-β-induced neurodegeneration (48.Bengoechea T.G. Chen Z. O'Leary D. Masliah E. Lee K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 7870-7875Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The involvement of p75 cleavage has not yet been assessed in this case or in the interaction with ephrin A reverse signaling (17.Lim Y.S. McLaughlin T. Sung T.C. Santiago A. Lee K.F. O'Leary D.D. Neuron. 2008; 59: 746-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is notable that the induction and cleavage of p75 occur in selective neurons that are destined to undergo intramembranous γ-secretase cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (49.Müller T. Meyer H.E. Egensperger R. Marcus K. Prog. Neurobiol. 2008; 85: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), which suggests that p75 cleavage may also represent an important early event during neurodegeneration. Further experiments to investigate the downstream effects of p75 cleavage will yield insight into these and other diverse possibilities. We thank Naoko Tanese, Hodaka Fujii, Jeffrey N. Savas, Lauren M. Young, and Sophie Restituito for kindly providing regents and advice during the course of this work."

This study describes the rPemK as a potent ribonuclease with a preference for pyrimidines (C/U), which is consistent with our previous study that demonstrated it as a translational attenuator. The in silico structural modeling of the PemK in conjunction with the site-directed mutagenesis confirmed the role of His-59 and Glu-78 as an acid-base couple in mediating the ribonuclease activity. The rPemK is shown to form a complex with the rPemI, which is in line with its function as a TA module. This rPemI-rPemK complex becomes catalytically inactive when both the proteins interact in a molar stoichiometry of 1. The rPemI displays vulnerability to proteolysis but attains conformational stability only upon rPemK interaction. The pemI-pemK transcript is shown to be up-regulated upon stress induction with a concomitant increase in the amount of PemK and a decline in the PemI levels, establishing the role of these modules in stress. The artificial perturbation of TA interaction could unleash the toxin, executing bacterial cell death. Toward this end, synthetic peptides are designed to disrupt the TA interaction. The peptides are shown to be effective in abrogating TA interaction in micromolar range in vitro. This approach can be harnessed as a potential antibacterial strategy against anthrax in the future.

It has been envisaged that these modules respond to intracellular stress facilitating phenotypic switching of the bacterial cell to a quasidormant stage amenable to survival under extreme conditions (8.Mittenhuber G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 295-302PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Fu Z. Donegan N.P. Memmi G. Cheung A. L J.

Lett. 2005; 253: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, a recent study demonstrates that TA loci do not impart selective advantage to the cells grown in stress, indicating that these genes can innocuously be deleted from the genome (13.Tsilibaris V. Maenhaut-Michel G. Mine N. Van Melderen L. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 6101-6108Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). toxin-antitoxin recombinant His6-tagged toxin recombinant His6-tagged antitoxin relative fluorescence intensity in arbitrary units 1-amino-2-naphthol-4-sulfonic acid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight red edge excitation spectroscopy polyacrylamide gel. Several families of two component TA loci have been identified on bacterial chromosomes, namely relBE, higBA, mazEF, ccdAB, vapBC, parDE, phd-doc, and yoeB-yefM. The toxins of these families share sequence and structural similarity to some extent, but the corresponding antidotes do not, thus indicating their distinct evolutionary origin (2.Buts L. Lah J. Dao-Thi M.H. Wyns L. Loris R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 672-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). However, despite their structural similarity and common ancestral origin, their downstream targets are quite different. CcdB and ParE function as gyrase poison, whereas MazF, Kid, YdcE, and YoeB are potent ribonucleases (14.Kedzierska B. Lian L.Y. Hayes F.

VapC toxins represent a structurally distinct family of ribonucleases having an α-helical pilT N-terminal domain (PIN domain) (23.Daines D.A. Wu M.H. Yuan S.Y. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 5041-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Our previous study had identified and characterized a pemIK TA module from Bacillus anthracis (4.Agarwal S. Agarwal S. Bhatnagar R. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This study was conducted to further delineate its mechanism of action. PemK is identified as a ribonuclease, and the probable catalytic residues essential for its activity are also proposed. Our study illustrates the cardinal significance of this TA module in stress. We also present evidence that peptide inhibitors can disrupt TA interaction, which can be exploited as a potential antibacterial strategy. The ubiquity of TA systems in other prokaryotes and their absolute absence from eukaryotes make them attractive targets for developing novel antibacterial therapeutics. Plasmid pET-28a(+) from Novagen (Madison, WI) was used for heterogeneous gene expression. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and BL21 (λDE3) (Novagen) were used as hosts for cloning and expression, respectively. Avirulent strain of B. anthracis (Sterne 34F2, pXO1+, pXO2−) was used in this study. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma. The function of PemK of B. anthracis was inferred by performing a BLAST search against the nonredundant data base at NCBI with the proteins possessing high similarity with PemK of B. anthracis. Total RNA was isolated from E. coli and B. anthracis using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Ten μg of cellular RNA was incubated with 2 μg of the rPemK at 25 °C for 15 min. The ability of the rPemI to neutralize the toxicity of rPemK was examined. A fixed concentration of rPemI (20 μm) was co-incubated with rPemK in varying molar stoichiometric ratios at 4 °C for 16–18 h prior to the addition of RNA. Samples were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis, and RNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The heat-denatured rPemK (boiled for 30 min) was also checked for its ability to cleave RNA. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis of the rPemK was carried out using a Bruker Daltonic Ultraflex TOF/TOF system, which was calibrated using calibration standard II (Bruker Daltonik GmbH, Germany) at the Centre for Genomic Application, New Delhi, India. Protein identification was carried out using the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, London, UK), and the NCBI nonredundant data base was used for peptide search. Chimeric oligonucleotides with a specific ribonucleotide (rA, rG, rU, and rC) dually labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein and black hole quencher 1 on the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) (24.Wang N.R. Hergenrother P.J. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 371: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured using a spectrofluorimeter (Cary Eclipse, Varian, Australia) at an excitation of 485 nm and emission at 530 nm in a 0.5-min time interval for 3 h. The slit width was set as 10 nm for both the excitation and emission filters. Each fluorescent-tagged oligonucleotide substrate (20 μm) was added in a 96-well microtiter plate in the absence or presence of 500 ng of the rPemK, and an increase in the fluorescence, if any, was monitored after every 0.5-min interval. Autodegradation of the substrates was subtracted from the experimental readings. RNase A (20 units) and bovine serum albumin (500 ng), included as positive and negative controls, respectively, were incubated with 20 μm of the rC. The exact molar stoichiometric ratio of the rPemI-rPemK interaction was assessed. For this, the rPemK (10 μm) was incubated with varying molar concentrations of the rPemI (0–50 μm) at 4 °C for 16–18 h prior to the addition of 30 μm rC, and the fluorescence quenching was recorded. Initial slopes were monitored for each case (RFI/min). The percent fluorescence quenching was calculated from the control containing 30 μm rC and 10 μm rPemK, whose fluorescence was considered as 100%. Similarly, the rPemI (50 μm) was titrated with increasing rPemK (0–500 μm) followed by the addition of 30 μm rC. The fluorescence obtained with the rPemI (50 μm)-rPemK (500 μm) complex with 30 μm rC was taken as 100%. Plasmids (1 μg) representing circular double-stranded DNA of different sizes (ranging from 3 to 10 kb) and a linear double-stranded DNA (600 bp) were incubated with 2 μg of the rPemK for 15 min at 25 °C. The samples were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Ribosomes were prepared essentially as described previously (25.Galvani C. Terry J. Ishiguro E.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2700-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Prior to use, the protein samples (rPemK and rAlr) were centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 3 h to remove any insoluble material. The ribosome-binding assay mixture containing ribosomes (500 μg) and rPemK was incubated at 4 °C for 60 min and centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 3 h to pellet the ribosomes and any associated proteins. The rPemI and rPemK were preincubated at 4 °C overnight to facilitate the reconstitution of the rPemI-rPemK complex. The pellets were resuspended, and an equal amount of protein was fractionated on SDS-PAG. The electrophoresed proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using specific antibodies directed against the protein and His6 monoclonal antibody. The rAlr (alanine racemase, ∼45-kDa purified recombinant protein of B. anthracis) was taken as a negative control. Multiple sequence alignment of the toxins (B. subtilis, YdcE; E. coli, Kid) was constructed using ClustalW (26.Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The final multiple sequence alignment was viewed using BioEdit (27.Tippmann H.F. Brief. Bioinform. 2004; 5: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and the similarity with the well characterized Kid toxin was used to predict the catalytic base of B. anthracis PemK. Initial fold recognition was done using the SVM-Fold server (28.Melvin I. Ie E. Kuang R. Weston J. Stafford W.N. Leslie C. BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: S2Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) followed by structural modeling using the Swiss-Model Workspace (29.Arnold K. Bordoli L. Koop J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6071) Google Scholar). The structure validation of the designed PemK model was done using Procheck (30.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar, 31.Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). The Verify3D program was also used for quality assessment of the model (32.Luthy R. Bowie J.W. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 356: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2616) Google Scholar). By exploiting the designed model of PemK, the favorably positioned residue in the structure was proposed as the probable catalytic acid. Additional conserved stabilizing residues were also proposed from this analysis. Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, the pETSAT plasmid harboring the wild type pemK (4.Agarwal S. Agarwal S. Bhatnagar R. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was used as a template for DpnI-based mutagenesis. The transformants obtained were subjected to dideoxy sequencing to confirm the incorporation of the specific mutations only at the desired positions and absence of any other random mutation(s) elsewhere. The oligonucleotides used for specific Q21A, H59A, H59K, E78A, E78D, and Q79A mutations are shown in the Table 1. All the mutant proteins were purified under native conditions using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as described previously (4.Agarwal S. Agarwal S. Bhatnagar R. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Equal proteins (2 μg) were tested for their potential to function as ribonuclease as described. The catalytic coefficients, Km and Vmax, of the mutants were calculated using double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot and were compared with the wild type rPemK employing increasing concentrations of the fluorigenic substrates (rC and rU).TABLE 1The sequences of the oligonucleotides employed in this studyPrimers usedSequence (5′–3′)Study purposeQ21A (F)TGGTTCTGAGGCCGGAGGTGTTCSite-directed mutagenesisQ21A (R)GAACACCTCCGGCCTCAGAACCASite-directed mutagenesisH59A (F)GAAATTACCCACTGCCGTGGAAATTGSite-directed mutagenesisH59A (R)CAATTTCCACGGCAGTGGGTAATTTCSite-directed mutagenesisE78A (F)TTATTTTACTTGCCCAGATTCGAACSite-directed mutagenesisE78A (R)GTTCGAATCTGGGCAAGTAAAATAASite-directed mutagenesisQ79A (F)ATTTTACTTGAGGCCATTCGAACAATCSite-directed mutagenesisQ79A (R)GATTGTTCGAATGGCCTCAAGTAAAATSite-directed mutagenesisH59K (F)AAATTACCCACTAAGGTGGAAATTSite-directed mutagenesisH59K (R)AATTTCCACCTTAGTGGGTAATTTSite-directed mutagenesisE78D (F)GTTATTTTACTTGATCAGATTCGASite-directed mutagenesisE78D (R)TCGAATCTGATCAAGTAAAATAACSite-directed mutagenesisΔ1–17 (F)GCCGGATCCATGGTAACGGAATTGGACGGAATTGGAConing of PemI deletion, ELISA17/30/50 (R)GCCGTCGACTTACCCCCCGCTAACTAAGCGTTCCloning of PemI deletion, ELISAΔ1–30 (F)GCCGGATCCAAGAATCGCCATGAACTAATTTGCCloning of PemI deletion, ELISAΔ1–50 (F)GCCGGATCCAAGAAACGCTACCAACATGAATCAATGCloning of PemI deletion, ELISA1–70 (F)GCCGGATCCGTGTCCGAATCAAGTGTAACTACTGCloning of PemI deletion, ELISA1–70 (R)GCCGTCGACATTAATTTTTCCCATTTCAATGTACCCloning of PemI deletion, ELISApemK (F)TGCAGACCTTTCCCCAGTTReal time PCRpemK (R)TGACAAGAACCGGACGAACAReal time PCRpemI (F)TGCCAGGCAACACAACTGTTReal time PCRpemI (R)TGATTCATGTTGGTAGCGTTTCTTReal time PCRdna gyr (F)GATGAGCAAGAGGTAGCGACAGTReal time PCRdna gyr (R)TCGCTCGTTTCTTCCTCATCAReal time PCR Open table in a new tab ELISA was performed by coating 500 ng of the rPemK (wild type) and its mutants in 0.1 m sodium carbonate coating buffer, pH 9.6, and incubating for 16 h at 4 °C in a 96-well plate as described. 500 ng of the rPemI was then added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The bound protein was captured by anti-rPemI antiserum raised in mouse (1:8000). Subsequent incubation with anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) was carried out for 1 h at 37 °C. The color was developed by the addition of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate, and the absorbance was read at 630 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The absorbance of the rPemI-rPemK complex was taken as 100%, and the extent of binding of the rPemK mutants to the rPemI was calculated. The influence of alanine substitution on the tertiary structure of the mutant proteins in comparison with the wild type rPemK was assessed. For this, the rPemK and mutants were analyzed for their fluorescence emission maxima at 25 °C in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Emission spectrum was obtained by exciting the samples at 280 nm and monitoring emissions from 295 to 350 nm. The slit widths were kept as 20 nm for both the filters. To study the effect of mutations on the secondary structure of the rPemK mutants in comparison with the wild type protein, CD spectroscopy was employed as described using 100 μg/ml of the proteins (4.Agarwal S. Agarwal S. Bhatnagar R. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The CD signals were converted to molar ellipticity by the following relationship: θm = θo × 100/lc, where θm is molar ellipticity (in degrees per cm2 per dmol); θo is the observed ellipticity (in degrees); l is the path length (in centimeters), and c is the molar concentration. For proteinase K-sensitive assay, 1 mg/ml of the rPemK and rPemI were mixed with proteinase K (10 μg/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl with 10% glycerol. Also, the rPemI-rPemK complex mixed in an equimolar ratio was also subjected to the proteinase K digestion. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for different time intervals. Reaction was terminated with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride before subjecting the samples to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The effect of proteinase K digestion on the functionality of the rPemK and rPemI individually and in a complex was assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively. For this, 10 μg of the total bacilli RNA was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min with the proteinase K-treated (10 μg/ml for 45 min) rPemK, rPemI, and rPemI-rPemK complex. Also, the proteinase K (10 μg/ml for 45 min)-treated rPemI was allowed to form a complex with the rPemK to generate rPemI(proteinase K)-rPemK complex, which was further incubated with the RNA as described above. The samples were electrophoresed on agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The samples were also incubated with 20 μm of the rC fluorigenic substrate, and the extent of cleavage was monitored and plotted in each case. Appropriate experimental controls were taken in both the cases as indicated under the “Results.” A Sephacryl-200 HiPrep16/60 FPLC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was calibrated with standard proteins (1 mg/ml), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45.0 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31.0 kDa), and lysozyme (14.4 kDa). 1 mg of the purified proteins (rPemK and rPemI) individually and as a complex were loaded onto the column. The flow rate was maintained at 0.5 ml/min, and the elution volumes were recorded. The rPemK (25 and 50 μm) was mixed with the rPemI (50 μm) in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) at 4 °C for 1 h and subjected to native PAGE. The bands were further sliced from the gel, processed, and subjected to second dimension electrophoresis on a 16% SDS-PAG. The protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The rPemI (14 kDa) was separated on 15% SDS-PAG and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane followed by renaturation by incubating the blot at 4 °C for 12 h in renaturation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). The blot was overlaid with an equimolar amount of the rPemK in renaturation buffer for 1 h. The rPemI was detected with the anti-rPemK antiserum (1:10,000) followed by the addition of a 1:10,000 dilution of sheep anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium dye substrate. Fresh ANS stock (1 mm, Sigma) was prepared in analytical grade ethanol. The rPemI and rPemK (25 μm) were titrated by increasing the ANS (0–200 μm) until the fluorescence intensity no longer changed. The fluorescence of bound ANS was determined by exciting the sample at 340 nm, and emission was recorded in the range of 400–600 nm. The saturating ANS concentration (140 μm) was used for further experiments. ANS (140 μm) was added to an equimolar complex of the rPemI-rPemK, and the change in the ANS fluorescence was compared with the ANS fluorescence observed with either of the proteins. Fluorescence polarization was carried out using a spectrofluorimeter equipped externally with a polarizing accessory. Excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission spectrum ranged from 310 to 450 nm. The change in the polarization of the rPemK (10 μm) and the rPemI-rPemK complex (10 μm each) was recorded. The G factor (grating correction factor) for each sample was also analyzed, and the polarization values were normalized by using the following equations: G factor = IHV/IHH·polarization = IVV − GIVH/IVV + G IVH. To determine the stoichiometry of the rPemI-rPemK interaction, 20 μm of the rPemI was titrated with increasing concentrations of the rPemK (0–50 μm), and the changes in the polarization signal were calculated. Acrylamide quenching experiment was performed at 25 °C. Fresh stock of 6 m acrylamide was prepared, and the rPemK was titrated by adding 2 μl of acrylamide each time with continuous stirring. Emission of the fluorophore was monitored at 315 nm by exciting the samples at 280 nm. Intensity data after quencher addition were averaged and corrected for the background emission. The Stern-Volmer (KSV) constant for measuring the accessibility of the fluorophore was calculated using the Stern-Volmer equation, F0/F = 1 + KSV [Q], where F and F0 are the emission intensities of the protein in the presence and absence of quencher, respectively; [Q] is the concentration of quencher (acrylamide), and KSV is the slope when data are plotted as F0/F versus [Q]. Similarly, for assessing the interaction of the rPemK with the rPemI, the recombinant proteins were preincubated for 16–18 h at 4 °C prior to the titration with 6 m acrylamide. The slopes obtained for the rPemK and the rPemI-rPemK complex were compared. CD spectra of the rPemK, rPemI, and their complex (rPemI-rPemK) (0.1 mg in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4) were obtained using Jasco J-815 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C using a 1-mm cell and wavelengths between 200 and 250 nm at a scanning speed of 20 nm/min. Ten successive spectra were accumulated in each case and averaged, followed by the base-line correction using the buffer. The fraction of the secondary structure in each protein was deconvoluted using the K2d software. CD spectrum was acquired in the near-UV range (250–300 nm) to assess the stoichiometry of protein interaction. Titration of the rPemK (20 μm) was performed with increasing concentrations of the rPemI (5–35 μm). The antitoxin spectrum was taken as the control, and base-line corrections were performed with buffer and the rPemK. Three successive spectra were recorded in a 1-cm cell and wavelengths between 250 and 330 nm at a scan speed of 20 nm/min. The CD values (millidegrees) were plotted on the y axis versus the calculated stoichiometry ([rPemK]/[rPemI]) on the x axis. To determine the stoichiometry of the rPemI-rPemK interaction, change in the REES upon interaction of the rPemK with rPemI was calculated by exciting the samples at 270 nm and recording the emission maximum ranging from 310 to 400 nm with an excitation increment of 5 nm and excitation and emission slit widths being 2.5 nm. The data were accumulated in a three-dimensional mode, and the excitation stop was set at 305 nm. The rPemI (20 μm) with buffer was considered as control and was subtracted from the REES obtained with experimental sample containing the rPemK. Similarly, change in the REES was analyzed upon interaction of the rPemI (20 μm) with the rPemK (0–50 μm) to determine the stoichiometry. Overnight-grown B. anthracis cultures were diluted to an absorbance (A600) of 0.1 in LB medium and grown at 37 °C until exponential phase (A600 of 0.6). An aliquot of the untreated cells was taken as control before stress exposure. Nutritional stress was induced by the addition of serine hydroxamate, a competitive inhibitor of seryl-tRNA synthetase (1 mg/ml). For heat shock and UV stress, cultures were either transferred to a water bath preset at 40 °C with gentle shaking for 1 h or kept under UV radiation for 1 h. Antibiotic stress was induced by adding chloramphenicol to a final concentration of 30 μg/ml. Mitomycin C (1 μg/ml), a DNA-damaging agent, was added in the culture medium. Cells harvested from each condition were analyzed for changes in the levels of specific pemI and pemK transcript/protein(s). The first cDNA strand was reverse-transcribed from 5 μg of DNase-treated RNA isolated from B. anthracis under normal and stress conditions using high capacity cDNA Protein Data Bank code kit (Applied Biosystems) employing random hexamers. Gene-specific primers were designed using the Primer Express software, version 2.0. The reaction was performed in a 20-μl volume containing 10 μl of 2× SYBR Green Mastermix (Applied Biosystems), 300 nm of primers, and 4 μl of 10-fold diluted reverse transcription products. The PCRs were run in ABI 7500 using the following program: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Following PCR amplification, the reactions were subjected to a temperature ramp to create the dissociation curve, which measures the changes in fluorescence as a function of temperature, by which the nonspecific products can be detected. The dissociation program was 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 15 s followed by 20 min of slow ramp from 60 to 95 °C. For each gene, cDNA dilution curves were generated to calculate the individual real time PCR efficiencies that were determined by measuring the values of the slopes obtained. Three technical replicates of each reaction were run and dna gyrase, as the constitutively expressed gene, was used as internal control for data normalization (33.Vetter S.M. Schlievert P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 1302-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Quantification of the relative changes in gene expression was performed using the 2−ΔΔCT method. The data were tabulated as fold change in gene expression normalized to a housekeeping gene and relative to the control. To assess the effect of stress on the expression profile of PemK and PemI, the cells were harvested post stress induction. Equal amount of protein was loaded on 12% SDS-PAG, and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blots were probed with anti-rPemK (1:10,000), anti-rPemI (1:8000), and anti-DNA gyrase antisera (1:10,000). The captured antibody was detected by incubation of a 1:10,000 dilution of sheep anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphate-conjugated antibody. The blot was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro"
https://openalex.org/W2035102492,"Neuronal migration is essential for proper cortical layer formation and brain function, because migration defects result in neurological disorders such as mental retardation and epilepsy. Neuronal migration is divided into several contiguous steps: early phase (multipolar mode), locomotion mode, and terminal translocation mode. The locomotion mode covers most of the migration route and thereby is the main contributor to cortical layer formation. However, analysis of the molecular mechanisms regulating this mode is difficult due to the secondary effects of defects at the early phase of migration. In this study, we established an ex vivo chemical inhibitor screening, allowing us to directly analyze the locomotion mode of migration. Roscovitine and PP2, inhibitors for Cdk5 and Src family kinases, respectively, suppressed the locomotion mode of migration. In line with this, a small percentage of Cdk5- or Src family kinase (Fyn)-knockdown cells exhibited locomoting morphology but retarded migration, although the majority of cells were stalled at the early phase of migration. We also showed that rottlerin, widely used as a specific inhibitor for protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta), suppressed the locomotion mode. Unexpectedly, however, the dominant-negative form as well as RNA interference for PKCdelta hardly affected the locomotion, whereas they may disturb terminal translocation. In addition, we found JNK to be a potential downstream target of rottlerin. Taken together, our novel chemical inhibitor screening provides evidence that Cdk5 and Src family kinases regulate the locomotion mode of neuronal migration. It also uncovered roles for Fyn and PKCdelta in the early and final phases of migration, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2169723296,"Background Influenza viruses cause serious infections that can be prevented or treated using vaccines or antiviral agents, respectively. While vaccines are effective, they have a number of limitations, and influenza strains resistant to currently available anti-influenza drugs are increasingly isolated. This necessitates the exploration of novel anti-influenza therapies. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the potential of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), a potent inhibitor of nucleic acid processing enzymes, to protect Madin-Darby canine kidney cells from influenza infection. We found, by neutral red assay, that ATA was protective, and by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively, confirmed that ATA reduced viral replication and release. Furthermore, while pre-treating cells with ATA failed to inhibit viral replication, pre-incubation of virus with ATA effectively reduced viral titers, suggesting that ATA may elicit its inhibitory effects by directly interacting with the virus. Electron microscopy revealed that ATA induced viral aggregation at the cell surface, prompting us to determine if ATA could inhibit neuraminidase. ATA was found to compromise the activities of virus-derived and recombinant neuraminidase. Moreover, an oseltamivir-resistant H1N1 strain with H274Y was also found to be sensitive to ATA. Finally, we observed additive protective value when infected cells were simultaneously treated with ATA and amantadine hydrochloride, an anti-influenza drug that inhibits M2-ion channels of influenza A virus. Conclusions/Significance Collectively, these data suggest that ATA is a potent anti-influenza agent by directly inhibiting the neuraminidase and could be a more effective antiviral compound when used in combination with amantadine hydrochloride."
https://openalex.org/W2051495919,"AAA(+) chaperone ClpX has been suggested to be a modulator of prokaryotic cytoskeletal protein FtsZ, but the details of recognition and remodeling of FtsZ by ClpX are largely unknown. In this study, we have extensively investigated the nature of FtsZ polymers and mechanisms of ClpX-regulated FtsZ polymer dynamics. We found that FtsZ polymerization is inhibited by ClpX in an ATP-independent manner and that the N-terminal domain of ClpX plays a crucial role for the inhibition of FtsZ polymerization. Single molecule analysis with high speed atomic force microscopy directly revealed that FtsZ polymer is in a dynamic equilibrium between polymerization and depolymerization on a time scale of several seconds. ClpX disassembles FtsZ polymers presumably by blocking reassembly of FtsZ. Furthermore, Escherichia coli cells overproducing ClpX and N-terminal domain of ClpX show filamentous morphology with abnormal localization of FtsZ. These data together suggest that ClpX modulates FtsZ polymer dynamics in an ATP-independent fashion, which is achieved by interaction between the N-terminal domain of ClpX and FtsZ monomers or oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W2077040278,"The interaction of factor Xa with factor Va on membranes to form prothrombinase profoundly increases the rate of the proteolytic conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. We present the characterization of an RNA aptamer (RNA11F7t) selected from a combinatorial library based on its ability to bind factor Xa. We show that RNA11F7t inhibits thrombin formation catalyzed by prothrombinase without obscuring the active site of Xa within the enzyme complex. Selective inhibition of protein substrate cleavage arises from the ability of the aptamer to bind to factor Xa and exclude interactions between the proteinase and cofactor within prothrombinase. Competition for enzyme complex assembly results from the binding of RNA11F7t to factor Xa with nanomolar affinity in a Ca2+-dependent interaction. RNA11F7t binds equivalently to the zymogen factor X as well as derivatives lacking γ-carboxyglutamic acid residues. We suggest that the ability of RNA11F7t to compete for the Xa-Va interaction with surprisingly high affinity likely reflects a significant contribution from its ability to indirectly impact regions of Xa that participate in the proteinase-cofactor interaction. Thus, despite the complexity of the macromolecular interactions that underlie the assembly of prothrombinase, efficient inhibition of enzyme complex assembly and thrombin formation can be achieved by tight binding ligands that target factor Xa in a discrete manner.

https://openalex.org/W2070375600,"Cellular migration is an essential prerequisite for metastatic dissemination of cancer cells. This study demonstrates that the neuron/testis-specific F-actin-targeted inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase-A (ITPKA) is ectopically expressed in different human tumor cell lines and during tumor progression in the metastatic tumor model Balb-neuT. High expression of ITPKA increases invasive migration in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft SCID mouse model. Mechanistic studies show that ITPKA promotes migration of tumor cells by two different mechanisms as follows: growth factor independently high levels of ITPKA induce the formation of large cellular protrusions by directly modulating the actin cytoskeleton. The F-actin binding activity of ITPKA stabilizes and bundles actin filaments and thus increases the levels of cellular F-actin. In growth factor-stimulated cells, the catalytically active domain enhances basal ITPKA-induced migration by activating store-operated calcium entry through production of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and subsequent inhibition of inositol phosphate 5-phosphatase. These two functional activities of ITPKA stimulating tumor cell migration place the enzyme among the potential targets of anti-metastatic therapy.

These two functional activities of ITPKA stimulating tumor cell migration place the enzyme among the potential targets of anti-metastatic therapy. The formation of distant metastases is a complex process involving escape of cancer cells from the primary tumor, dissemination to distant organs, and finally re-colonization and expansion (1.Comoglio P.M. Trusolino L. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 857-862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For metastatic dissemination, the cancer cell must acquire the ability to migrate, which is associated with cytoskeletal re-arrangements. Migrating cells extend actin-based filopodia and lamellipodia at the leading edge. To initiate this process, a local formation of F-actin is required, which can be mediated by actin nucleating (e.g. Arp2/3 and formins (2.Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2007; 36: 451-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar)), F-actin bundling (e.g. fascin (3.Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 5: 993-1006Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar)), and by F-actin cross-linking proteins (e.g. filamins (4.Popowicz G.M. Schleicher M. Noegel A.A. Holak T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 7: 411-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (235) Google Scholar)). The actin-severing proteins ADF/cofilin and gelsolin depolymerize F-actin and thus increase actin turnover (5.Stossel T.P. Chaponnier C. Ezzell R.M. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lind S.E. Smith D.B. Southwick F.S. Yin H.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 353-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The balance between stimulation of actin-polymerizing proteins and actin-depolymerizing proteins is tightly regulated by distinct signaling pathways (e.g. phospholipase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (6.Feldner J.C. Brandt B.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 272: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 7.Welch H.C. Coadwell W.J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T.

As activation of these pathways can also result in induction of proliferation, “fine-tuning” of continuous signal inputs determines the cellular response. This fine-tuning is mediated by various small molecules, including calcium, cyclic AMP, phosphatidylinositol phosphates, and inositol phosphates. Among the inositides, membranous phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate plays a central role in the control of migration as it regulates the activity of cofilin, gelsolin, and profilin (9.DesMarais V. Ghosh M. Eddy R. Condeelis J. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 10.Gremm D. Wegner A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4339-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and serves as a substrate for the production of the calcium-mobilizing second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3). 2The abbreviations used are: Ins(1,4,5)P3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphateITPKAinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase-AHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatographyFCSfetal calf serumPBSphosphate-buffered salineEGFepidermal growth factorSOCEstore-operated Ca2+ entryCaMcalmodulinGFPgreen fluorescent proteinITPK1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferase5-PPTinositol phosphate 5-phosphataseIPMKinositol polyphosphate multikinaseABDactin binding domainIns(1,3,4,5)P4inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphateshRNAshort hairpin RNAkdknockdown.

Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase isoenzymes (ITPKA, ITPKB, and ITPKC) metabolize Ins(1,4,5)P3 to inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4), and thus regulate Ins(1,4,5)P3-induced calcium signals (11.Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The ITPK isoenzymes are highly conserved in their catalytically active C-terminal domains but show large differences in their N-terminal regulatory domains mediating mainly cellular targeting. The isoenzymes differ in subcellular localization and tissue expression patterns. ITPKB and ITPKC mRNAs are ubiquitously expressed, whereas mRNA of ITPKA was only identified in neurons and testis (12.Vanweyenberg V. Communi D. D'Santos C.S. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In neurons, ITPKA was shown to be targeted to F-actin via an N-terminal actin binding domain (amino acids 1–66 (13.Schell M.J. Erneux C. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37537-37546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)) and was suggested to be relevant for long term potentiation and spatial learning (14.Jun K. Choi G.

Remarkably, in some malignant transformed cells, ectopic expression of the neuronal/testicular ITPK isoform has been found. ITPKA expression levels are increased in two different MDA mammary carcinoma cell lines overexpressing ErbB2 (16.Benz C.C. Scott G.K. Sarup J.C. Johnson R.M. Tripathy D. Coronado E. Shepard H.M.

J. 1996; 319: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), ITPKA activity is increased 7-fold, and enhanced protein levels of ITPKA were detected in the center of cutaneous malignant melanoma (19.Roesch A. Vogt T. Stolz W. Dugas M. Landthaler M. Becker B. Melanoma Res. 2003; 13: 503-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ITPKA in the lung carcinoma cell line H1299 induces the formation of actin-based cell protrusions and increases migration (20.Windhorst S. Blechner C. Lin H.Y. Elling C. Nalaskowski M. Kirchberger T. Guse A.H. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), indicating a role of ITPKA in actin remodeling and cell motility. In this study, we examined the mechanistic role of ITPKA in tumor cell migration and metastasis. NCI-H1299 (H1299) cells were kindly provided by Cagatay Günes (Hamburg, Germany); A549 and skin fibroblasts cells were a gift from Ulla Kasten-Pisula (Hamburg, Germany), and Mevo and T47D cells were provided by Udo Schumacher (Hamburg, Germany). For characteristics of these cells, see American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cell lines HepG2, MDA-MB-231 (MDA231), and SKBR-3 were purchased from ATCC, and normal lung (IMR-90) and mammary epithelial cells (HmEpc) were obtained from Cell Culture Service (Hamburg, Germany). The cell lines HepG2, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, NCI-H1299, A549, and SKBR-3 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Mevo and T47D were grown in RPMI 1640 medium; both media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS), 4 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. IMR-90 cells were cultivated in α-minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS. These media were purchased from Invitrogen. HmEpc were grown in mammary epithelial cell media supplemented with 10% FCS (Cell Applications, San Diego). The Balb-neuT tissue samples (21.Muller W.J. Sinn E. Pattengale P.K. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1988; 54: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar) were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde solution and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of all samples were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. Microwave antigen retrieval was performed for 20 min using 20 mm citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Consecutive incubation steps with peroxidase-blocking solution (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) and 2.5% normal horse serum were performed to block endogenous peroxidase activity and nonspecific antibody binding, respectively. The primary antibody, affinity-purified goat anti-ITPKA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), was used at a concentration of 1.3 μg/ml and incubated with the tissue section overnight at 4 °C. As a negative control, duplicate sections were incubated with normal goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at the same dilution. The secondary antibody polymer (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and the diaminobenzidine chromogen system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated, and coverslipped with permanent mounting medium. To evaluate the specificity of the anti-ITPKA antibody, paraffin-embedded samples of H1299 control, H1299 kd cells, and of H299 cells overexpressing ITPKA were used for comparative stainings. For the preparation of lysates, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested in MPER buffer (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The resulting suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen, thawed, and then centrifuged (15 min, 15,000 × g, 4 °C). Protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined using the Bradford assay, and the remaining supernatant was immediately added to Laemmli sample buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.3% mercaptoethanol, 0.032% bromphenol blue). 20 μg of protein were analyzed by Western blot using a standard protocol. For detection of expression of ITPKA, the same antibody as used in the immunohistochemistry experiments was employed in a dilution of 1:2000. The secondary anti-goat antibody (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) was diluted 1:5000. Specific immune complexes were visualized by employing the ECL™ Advance Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Signal intensities were analyzed by a luminescent image analyzer (model LAS-3000 Plus, Fuji Film). For immunocytology, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were treated with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 3 min and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at room temperature. Between each step, the cells were washed three times with PBS. The cells were then treated with the anti-ITPKA antibody (see above) diluted 1:200 in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-goat antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in a dilution of 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature and were finally washed three times with PBS. Cells were transfected with Lipofectamine™ LTX and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. This experiment was performed as described previously (20.Windhorst S. Blechner C. Lin H.Y. Elling C. Nalaskowski M. Kirchberger T. Guse A.H. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For establishment of A549 or H1299 cells overexpressing ITPKA, the cDNA fragment encoding for ITPKA was cloned into the retroviral vector MigRI. For virus production, this construct (or the original vector as control) was co-transfected with SVgp (M57) and pHCMV-VSV-G (M75) into HEK293 phoenix ampho cells. Vectors were kindly provided by Manfred Jücker (from our laboratory). After 48 h of incubation, the supernatant containing the viruses was filtered and transferred to A549 or H1299 cells, respectively. After 1 week of cultivation, the virus-transduced cells were sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorter based on their GFP fluorescence. For stable knockdown of ITPKA expression in MDA231 and H1299 cells, a lentiviral transduction approach was employed. Five different vectors (pLKO.1 shRNA) from Sigma expressing shRNA against ITPKA were tested. An almost complete down-regulation of ITPKA was achieved with one of them, and this vector was used for all further experiments. As a control, cells were transduced with the control vectors (expressing GFP or scrambled shRNA). For producing lentiviral particles, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with pLKO.1 shRNA plasmid, psPAX2 packaging plasmid, and pMD2.G envelope plasmid (both Addgene, Cambridge, MA). After 24 h of incubation, the supernatant containing the viruses was mixed with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) and transferred to MDA231 or H1299 cells, respectively. After 96 h of incubation, the cells were changed to fresh medium containing 1.5 μg/ml puromycin to select for infected cells over a period of 8 days. H1299 control and kd cells were plated at low density on glass bottom culture dishes (35 mm, MatTek, Ashland, MA). After 16 h of incubation, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. Thee Ca2+ indicator Fura 2/AM (Calbiochem) was then added to the medium at a final concentration of 4 μm. After 30 min (37 °C), the cells were washed twice, and medium was replaced with buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). Imaging of cells was performed using a Leica DM-IRBE fluorescence microscope with a ×40 objective (1.3 numerical aperture). Alternating excitation at 340 and 380 nm was achieved using a monochromator system (Polychrome II; TILL Photonics, Graefelfing, Germany). Two images were acquired every 2 s with a grayscale CCD camera (type C4742-95-12NRB; Hamamatsu, Enfield, UK) in 8 bit-mode. Raw data were stored on a hard disk, and ratio images (340:380 nm) were calculated from median filtered (3 × 3 pixels) raw images using Openlab software (version 3.09; Improvision, Tübingen, Germany). For the determination of the duration of the signal, cells were selected as regions of interest, and the mean ratio of the regions of interest over time was used for further analysis. 96-Well plates were coated with 15% gelatin (diluted 1:2 in PBS/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. 1 × 104 cells (in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) were then seeded per well and cultivated for 48 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The transwell assay was performed as described previously (20.Windhorst S. Blechner C. Lin H.Y. Elling C. Nalaskowski M. Kirchberger T. Guse A.H. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). See supplemental Fig. S1. H1299 control and H1299 cells overexpressing ITPKA (H1299-ITPKA) cells were injected subcutaneously in BALB/c severe combined immunodeficient SCID/SCID (SCID) mice (n = 9–10) as described previously (22.Jojovic M. Schumacher U. Cancer Lett. 2000; 152: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mice were sacrificed when solid tumors were about the same size; the tumor weight was about 4 g, and the diameter was about 1 cm. The lungs were dissected and treated as described previously (22.Jojovic M. Schumacher U. Cancer Lett. 2000; 152: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In brief, the lungs were fixed en bloc in formalin and then embedded in agar, which was processed to wax. The blocks were cut in 5-μm sections, and every 10th section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. To evaluate the presence of spontaneous lung metastases, the stained sections of each lung were examined at a 1 × 200 magnification. Irrespective of the size, all distant lung metastases found in one section were counted, and then the results of all sections were summed to calculate the total number of metastases per lung according to an established formula (22.Jojovic M. Schumacher U. Cancer Lett. 2000; 152: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The cDNA of GFP-ITPKA cloned into the vector pEGFP-C1 (20.Windhorst S. Blechner C. Lin H.Y. Elling C. Nalaskowski M. Kirchberger T. Guse A.H. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was mutated by QuikChange PCR to generate a silent mutation causing resistance to anti-ITPKA-shRNA. Transfection of this modified vector for stable expression of GFP-ITPKA was performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. H1299 kd cells were transfected with GFP-ITPKA, GFP-ITPKA-D416N, or GFP, and lines were then selected using G418. Expression of GFP-ITPKA fusion proteins was examined by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP or anti-ITPKA antibodies. A cDNA fragment encoding the full-length form of ITPKA was inserted into the vector pGEX-4T-3 encoding an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. From transformed E. coli cell lysates (BL21 DE3, the fusion protein was purified utilizing a glutathione matrix. The purified GST or GST-ITPKA proteins were dialyzed against polymerization or G-buffer (see below) and centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min, and protein concentrations of supernatants were determined by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as standard. Polymerization assays were performed essentially according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) using rabbit muscle actin and pyrene-labeled rabbit muscle actin (Cytoskeleton) in a ratio of 1:10. For depolymerization of F-actin, actin solutions (40 μm actin in G-buffer: 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP) were incubated on ice for 4 h and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g in a Beckmann Optima™ TL ultracentrifuge. The G-actin concentration of the supernatant was determined by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE using bovine serum albumin as standard. To measure polymerization, 10 μm G-actin and 1 μm pyrene-labeled G-actin were mixed. The G-buffer and GST or GST-ITPKA proteins (diluted in G-buffer) were then added to a final volume of 180 μl. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, the basal fluorescence was measured in an F-2000 fluorescence spectrometer (HITACHI; excitation 365 nm, emission 407 nm) for ≥2 min. Polymerization was started by adding 20 μl of ×10 polymerization buffer (end concentration in 200 μl: 1 μm G-actin, 0.1 μm pyrene-labeled G-actin, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP). For determination of dilution-induced F-actin depolymerization, 40 μm rabbit muscle actin, 8 μm pyrene-labeled rabbit muscle actin dissolved in G-buffer were diluted in 1× polymerization buffer to 1 μm actin, 0.2 μm pyrene actin. This solution was incubated at room temperature for 4 h in the presence or absence of GST or GST-ITPKA proteins (diluted in polymerization buffer). Spontaneous depolymerization of F-actin was initiated by performing a 10-fold dilution (0.1 μm actin, 0.02 μm pyrene actin) in polymerization buffer, and pyrene-actin fluorescence was continuously measured. To measure gelsolin induced F-actin depolymerization, 1 μm actin, 0.1 μm pyrene actin diluted in polymerization buffer was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence of GST-ITPKA, GST, or GST-ITPKA L34P. Gelsolin-induced depolymerization was measured after addition of 0.05 μm gelsolin by decrease of actin pyrene fluorescence. 2 μm rabbit muscle actin (Cytoskeleton) diluted in polymerization buffer was incubated with 0.6 μm GST, 0.6 μm GST-ITPKA L34P, or different concentrations of GST-ITPKA (0.0375, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 μm) for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation for 15 min at 7000 × g, the supernatants and the pellets were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. 2 μg of actin were used as standard. To visualize actin, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. To quantify the amount of actin, the signal intensity of the actin bands derived from pellets and supernatants were determined with an image analyzer. The G/total actin ratio in cells was measured according to Katsantonis et al. (23.Katsantonis J. Tosca A. Koukouritaki S.B. Theodoropoulos P.A. Gravanis A. Stournaras C. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1994; 12: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The principle of this assay is that only G-actin and not F-actin inhibits the activity of DNase I. The cellular G-actin content is directly determined from cell lysates by measuring inhibition of DNase I. For determination of total cellular actin, cell lysates are treated with guanidine HCl to depolymerize F-actin. The F-actin content can be calculated by subtracting the G-actin amount from the total cellular actin (F = T − G). 5 × 106 cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm K2HPO4, 100 mm NaF, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 m sucrose, pH 7.0). For determination of the G-actin content, the suspension was diluted 1:10 in lysis buffer, and 10 μl were added to 10 μl of DNase I solution (0.1 mg/ml DNase I in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5). 980 μl of DNA solution (40 μg of DNA in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 4 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5) were pipetted into a quartz cuvette (Suprasil), and basal absorption was monitored for 5 min at 30 °C at 260 nm in a Lambda 20 UV-visible spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The DNase I/cell suspension mixture (20 μl) was than added, and DNase I activity was monitored continuously. The concentration of cellular G-actin was determined by reference to a G-actin standard curve for inhibition of DNase I activity. To measure total actin, 10 μl of the 1:10 dilution of the cell suspension was treated with 10 μl of guanidine HCl buffer (1.5 m guanidine HCl, 1 m sodium acetate, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) to depolymerize F-actin. After 20 min of incubation at room temperature, 10 μl of DNase I solution was added, and the sample (30 μl) was mixed with 970 μl of DNA solution to measure DNase I inhibition (see above). Finally, the G-actin content was related to total protein concentration, which was determined by using the Bradford assay. The metabolism of Ins(1,4,5)P3 by total cytosolic Ins(1,4,5)P3-3-kinase (ITPK) and Ins(1,4,5)P3-5-phosphatase (5-PPT) activity was analyzed by using an ammonium sulfate-precipitated and thoroughly dialyzed cell extract. For that, four culture dishes with 2 × 107 cells each were washed three times with PBS at room temperature in their culture dishes, and after complete removal of PBS, the cells were lysed by adding 3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer per dish (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 100 mm NaF, 12 mm mercaptoethanol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, phosphatase-stop and proteinase inhibitor mixture, Roche Diagnostics) and freezing in liquid nitrogen and re-thawing three times. After 20 min of centrifugation at 13,000 × g and at 4 °C, the supernatant was diluted to 17 ml with ice-cold buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5, and extracted protein was precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 50% saturation for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g and at 4 °C, the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of buffer A and dialyzed against this buffer for 4 h at 4 °C, whereby the dialysis buffer was changed every 30 min. After dialysis, the solution was centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C, and protein concentration of the supernatant was determined by using the Bradford assay. To analyze Ins(1,4,5)P3 metabolism, about 420 μg of protein extract was assayed in a total volume of 800 μl. 160 μl of dialyzed protein was diluted into 600 μl of assay buffer composed of (final concentrations) 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 7 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 10 μg/ml pyruvate kinase and preincubated to 30 °C, and the assay was started with 40 μl of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (Alexis, San Diego) giving an initial concentration of 10.6 μm. Five aliquots of 150 μl were withdrawn between 0 and 40 min of incubation at 30 °C. For activation of ITPK by Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM), 2.15 μg/ml calmodulin and 10–20 μm free CaCl2 were in the assay mixture. Samples were treated for HPLC analysis as described previously (20.Windhorst S. Blechner C. Lin H.Y. Elling C. Nalaskowski M. Kirchberger T. Guse A.H. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and Ins(1,4,5)P3 and its metabolites Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,3,4)P3, and Ins(1,3,4,6)P4 were analyzed by Micro MDD-HPLC as described previously (24.Sauer K. Huang Y.H. Lin H. Sandberg M. Mayr G.W. Current Protocols in Immunology. Wiley Interscience, New York2009: 11.1.1-11.1.46Google Scholar). Total ITPK activity was determined for individual intervals as the sum of the rates of formation of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, Ins(1,3,4)P3, and Ins(1,3,4,6)P4. 5-PPT activity over time of incubation was defined as the rate of decrease of Ins(1,4,5)P3 minus the actual rate of ITPK. Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was averaged for each interval. Specific activities were determined by referring to cellular extract protein concentration. To measure 5-PPT activity under kinase-inactive conditions, ATP, phosphoenolpyruvate, and protein kinase were omitted from the assay buffer, and total MgCl2 was reduced to 4 mm. Due to rapid further dephosphorylation, only the Ins(1,4,5)P3 decrease was used to determine specific activity. Total cellular activity of the ITPKA isoforms was determined after immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from cell lysates prepared as described previously (20.Windhorst S. Blechner C. Lin H.Y. Elling C. Nalaskowski M. Kirchberger T. Guse A.H. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2008; 414: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ITPKA assays in the absence and presence of Ca2+/CaM were performed as described above. In contrast to the assays with total extracted protein, an Ins(1,4,5)P3 decrease precisely corresponding to the Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 formation was found in assays, indicating that no 5-PPT activity was co-immunoprecipitated. The activity found was referred to cellular extract protein concentration. Kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting corresponding kinetic functions to the data sets with GraphPad PRISM. If not stated explicitly, statistical comparisons of normalized values were made using Student's t test for unpaired samples. p values ≤0.05 were taken to indicate significant differences between groups. ITPKA (GenBank™ accession number X54938, Swiss-Prot entry P23677) was reported to be up-regulated in four malignant cell types (16.Benz C.C. Scott G.K. Sarup J.C. Johnson R.M. Tripathy D. Coronado E.

https://openalex.org/W2074500442,"Apoptosis plays important roles in host defense, including the elimination of virus-infected cells. The executioners of apoptosis are caspase family proteases. We report that vaccinia virus-encoded F1L protein, previously recognized as anti-apoptotic viral Bcl-2 family protein, is a caspase-9 inhibitor. F1L binds to and specifically inhibits caspase-9, the apical protease in the mitochondrial cell death pathway while failing to inhibit other caspases. In cells, F1L inhibits apoptosis and proteolytic processing of caspases induced by overexpression of caspase-9 but not caspase-8. An N-terminal region of F1L preceding the Bcl-2-like fold accounts for caspase-9 inhibition and significantly contributes to the anti-apoptotic activity of F1L. Viral F1L thus provides the first example of caspase inhibition by a Bcl-2 family member; it functions both as a suppressor of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and as an inhibitor of caspase-9, thereby neutralizing two sequential steps in the mitochondrial cell death pathway."

We evaluated the MODS assay for diagnosis of TB in children in Viet Nam. 217 consecutive samples including sputum (n = 132), gastric fluid (n = 50), CSF (n = 32) and pleural fluid (n = 3) collected from 96 children with suspected TB, were tested by smear, MODS and MGIT. When test results were aggregated by patient, the sensitivity and specificity of smear, MGIT and MODS against “clinical diagnosis” (confirmed and probable groups) as the gold standard were 28.2% and 100%, 42.3% and 100%, 39.7% and 94.4%, respectively. The sensitivity of MGIT and MODS was not significantly different in this analysis (P = 0.5), but MGIT was more sensitive than MODS when analysed on the sample level using a marginal model (P = 0.03). The median time to detection of MODS and MGIT were 8 days and 13 days, respectively, and the time to detection was significantly shorter for MODS in samples where both tests were positive (P<0.001). An analysis of time-dependent sensitivity showed that the detection rates were significantly higher for MODS than for MGIT by day 7 or day 14 (P<0.001 and P = 0.04), respectively. MODS is a rapid and sensitive alternative method for the isolation of M.tuberculosis from children."

Structures of the ISP from Rhodobacter sphaeroides show that serine 154 and tyrosine 156 form H-bonds to S-1 of the [2Fe-2S] cluster and to the sulfur atom of the cysteine liganding Fe-1 of the cluster, respectively. These are responsible in part for the high potential (Em,7 ∼300 mV) and low pKa (7.6) of the ISP, which determine the overall reaction rate of the bc1 complex. We have made site-directed mutations at these residues, measured thermodynamic properties using protein film voltammetry to evaluate the Em and pKa values of ISPs, explored the local proton environment through two-dimensional electron spin echo envelope modulation, and characterized function in strains S154T, S154C, S154A, Y156F, and Y156W. Alterations in reaction rate were investigated under conditions in which concentration of one substrate (ubiquinol or ISPox) was saturating and the other was varied, allowing calculation of kinetic terms and relative affinities.

In Rhodobacter sphaeroides, the bc1 complex, together with the reaction center (RC) and cytochrome (cyt) c2, forms the photosynthetic chain. The complex catalyzes oxidation of substrate ubiquinol (QH2) by a water-soluble ferricytochrome c2 in the periplasmic space and generates a proton-motive force for ATP synthesis through a Q-cycle mechanism (1.Mitchell P.

Proteins of the bc1 complex family form homodimers inserted in the cellular or mitochondrial membrane, each monomer containing minimally the three subunits (cyt b with two b-type hemes (bH and bL), cyt c1 with heme c1, and Rieske-type iron-sulfur protein (ISP)) that form the catalytic core of the complex. The α-proteobacterial ancestors of mitochondria were likely derived from photosynthetic progenitors, accounting for the high degree of homology in sequence, structure, and mechanism. The bacterial structures are much simpler than the 8–11 subunit complexes in mitochondria. The isolated complex has four subunits in each monomer (cyt b, cyt c1, ISP, and subunit IV) (9.Andrews K.M.

The R. sphaeroides system provides a convenient model for mitochondrial systems because flash activation through the RC initiates turnover, and kinetics can then be measured spectrophotometrically. In addition, the catalytic core (ISP, cyt b, and cyt c1) is encoded on an operon expressed from a single promoter, which allows for easy genetic manipulation (11.Yun C.H. Beci R. Crofts A.R.

It is driven by the work available from the redox difference between QH2 (Em,7 ∼90 mV) and the high potential chain (Em,7 ∼300 mV for ISP). The oxidized ISP acts as the acceptor on QH2 oxidation, in a proton-coupled electron transfer, and this step was shown to include the high activation barrier for QH2 oxidation.

After the first electron and proton transfer, the second electron is transferred from the intermediate semiquinone to a low potential chain composed of two b-type hemes (bL and bH), which reduce the quinone (Q) at the Qi-site by electrogenic electron transfer across the membrane. The second proton exits the Qo-site, probably via Glu-295 and a water chain to the P-phase (19.Crofts A.R. Hong S. Ugulava N. Barquera B. Gennis R. Guergova-Kuras M. Berry E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 10021-10026Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The redox reactions at the Qo- and Qi-sites release protons to the periplasmic space or take them up from the cytoplasm, respectively, so that, overall, two protons per QH2 oxidized are pumped across the membrane to generate a proton-motive force that drives ATP synthesis. All Rieske-type iron-sulfur clusters consist of a [2Fe-2S] core with two histidines as ligands to one iron and two cysteines as ligands to the other (Fig. 1) (20.Rieske J.S. Maclennan D.H. Coleman R.

The [2Fe-2S] cluster of the ISP has a net charge of 0 or −1 for the oxidized and reduced forms, respectively.

Structure. 1996; 4: 567-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) showed that the cluster is surrounded by additional electron-withdrawing residues, among them Ser-154 and Tyr-156 (as numbered in the R. sphaeroides enzyme). Ser-154 forms an H-bond to the S-1 atom of the cluster, whereas Tyr-156 H-bonds to the Sγ of the side chain of Cys-129, a cysteine ligand (Fig. 1). These two residues thus contribute substantially to the electronegativity responsible for the high potential (Em ∼300 mV in mitochondria and α-proteobacteria (30.Prince R.G. Dutton P.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7436-7444Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the work of Klingen and Ullmann (21.Klingen A.R. Ullmann G.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12383-12389Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the pKa values of Rieske iron-sulfur clusters of bc-type and ferredoxin-type were calculated using density functional theory/electrostatic approaches based on the protein environment, and they suggested that the high Em and low pKa values in the former were largely determined by hydrogen bonding from these and other groups around the cluster. In this study, we describe construction of mutant strains in R. sphaeroides altered in these hydrogen-bonding residues, including S154C as a functional mutant that has not been previously reported. We evaluate electrochemical parameters and analyze the driving forces that determine the rate of the first electron transfer reaction in the bc1 complex. The redox midpoint potentials (Em values) of the mutant ISPs were measured in the intact complex using CD spectroscopy at pH 7.4 and, over a pH range from 4 to 14, using protein film voltammetry of the isolated subunit (33.Zu Y. Couture M.M. Kolling D.R. Crofts A.R. Eltis L.D. Fee J.A. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12400-12408Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) to identify pK values. The proton environment was explored by ESEEM spectroscopy to identify H-bonds lost in two mutant strains. Dependence of the rate of QH2 oxidation on pre-steady state conditions at the Qo-site was determined in chromatophores, using kinetic spectrophotometry after flash excitation. Redox poising was used to control the degree of reduction of the quinone pool (12.Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 34.Snozzi M. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or variation of the pH in the physiological pH range (pH 5.5–10) to change the concentration of the imidazolate (substrate) form of oxidized ISP [ISPox] while keeping [QH2] constant (14.Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This manipulation of the driving force of the reaction provided results allowing analysis of the “proton-first-then-electron” (PT/ET) mechanism proposed in the context of a Marcus-Brønsted (16.Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1655: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) model and a deeper understanding of the dependence of electron transfer on these characteristics. Plasmid vectors, growth conditions, and site-directed mutagenesis protocols were conventional and are describe in detail in the supplemental material. Chromatophores were prepared essentially as described previously (12.Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 14.Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol.

They were also used as an enriched source of the bc1 complex protein, which was purified essentially as described by Guergova-Kuras et al. (10.Guergova-Kuras M. Salcedo-Hernandez R. Bechmann G. Kuras R. Gennis R.B. Crofts A.R. Protein Expr. Purif. 1999; 15: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column chromatography (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) of the complex with a His6 tag at the C terminus of the cyt b subunit. The final eluant from the column was concentrated and redissolved in 50 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.01% n-decyl-β-d-maltoside, 15 μg/ml phosphatidylcholine (pH 7.0). The purified mutant proteins were stored for future use at −80 °C after adding glycerol to a final concentration of 20% (w/v). Two different preparations of the ISP were used, a proteolyzed iron-sulfur protein fragment, used in spectroscopic (35.Dikanov S.A. Kolling D.R. Endeward B. Samoilova R.I. Prisner T.F. Nair S.K.

Nair S.K. Structure. 2007; 15: 29-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and an intact subunit, used for protein film voltammetry because it adhered better to the graphite electrode (33.Zu Y. Couture M.M. Kolling D.R. Crofts A.R. Eltis L.D. Fee J.A. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12400-12408Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The subunit from the mutant bc1 complexes was extracted using a modification of the alkaline extraction protocol, because the stability at high pH of mutant ISP was lower than that of wild type. To separate subunits of the bc1 complex, the concentrated protein sample was diluted in a solution containing 2.5 mm TAPS and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside at pH 9.5. The diluted sample was filtered in a Centriplus® centrifugal concentrator with a cutoff of 100 kDa and, after dilution in ⅓ volume of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer with 2 m NaCl, the ISP-containing filtrate was then concentrated in a Centriplus® concentrator with a cutoff of 30 kDa. All fractions were checked by gel electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide for purity (data not shown). CD spectroscopic data were obtained using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter as described previously (32.Ugulava N.B. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The purified bc1 protein was diluted at 2 μm in the 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.8 m sucrose, 0.01% dodecyl maltoside, and appropriate redox mediators (32.Ugulava N.B. Crofts A.R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The poised potential in the measuring chamber was controlled by adding sodium hydrosulfite or potassium ferricyanide. The CD difference spectra obtained were fitted to a Gaussian curve with the peak at 500 nm and a width at the half-height of 30 nm. The relative concentration of reduced ISP was calculated by the difference in the fitted plot at 500 and 470 nm. The Em value of the ISP was estimated from plots of relative concentration as a function of the ambient potential (Eh) and fitted to a Nernst equation with z = 1 (Fig. 2). The redox midpoint potentials of the isolated mutant ISPs were estimated by protein film voltammetry (33.Zu Y. Couture M.M. Kolling D.R. Crofts A.R. Eltis L.D. Fee J.A. Hirst J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12400-12408Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The protein samples were spread on the polished surface of a pyrolytic graphite electrode, which was then placed in an all-glass cell containing appropriate medium, saturated with nitrogen gas to maintain anaerobic conditions. The reversible cyclic voltammograms were recorded via a CV27 voltammeter (Bioanalytical Systems Inc., West Lafayette, IN) in buffers of various pH values in the range 4 to 14, and the peak positions obtained in both directions were averaged to obtain Em values. The position of each peak was determined with the help of the algorithm of the “peak fitting module” in OriginPro® 7.5 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). The activities of the bc1 complex of wild type and mutant strains were measured by flash-induced kinetics of cytochromes, RC, and electrochromic absorbance changes in chromatophores (14.Hong S. Ugulava N. Guergova-Kuras M. Crofts A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33931-33944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36.Crofts A.R. Shinkarev V.P. Kolling D.R. Hong S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36191-36201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). For most experiments, the reactions were triggered by a single ∼90% saturating actinic flash that activated the RC to generate the substrates of the bc1 complex, and the subsequent turnover of the Qo-site in the presence of 10 μm antimycin A was measured from initial rates of reduction of the cyt bH through the difference kinetics at ΔA561–569. Reactant concentrations were varied by changing the pH or redox poise in a closed anaerobic reaction cuvette, flushed with water-saturated argon gas. The chromatophores were diluted to give a RC concentration of ∼0.5 μm in a reaction medium (usually 100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, buffered at pH 7.0) containing appropriate redox mediators (5 μm each of phenazine ethosulfate, N-ethylphenazonium ethosulfate, phenazine methosulfate, N-ethylphenazonium methosulfate, and diaminodurene, 2,3,5,6-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine), ionophores to collapse the proton gradient (2 μm each of nigericin and valinomycin), and 0.5 mm FeNa(EDTA)2 as redox buffer. In some experiments, 2 mm KCN was included as a control for initial experiments in which ascorbate and KCN were added under aerobic conditions to give an approximate Eh for the Q-pool at ∼140 mV. The KCN served to inhibit oxidation of cyt c2 through oxidase activities. However, the added KCN affected neither redox poise nor the measured kinetic under the anaerobic conditions of the redox poised experiments. The ambient redox potential was monitored, and potentials were adjusted by adding potassium ferricyanide or sodium hydrosulfite (dithionite). The pH dependence of the pre-steady state kinetics was determined essentially as described above, but with the following modifications. Chromatophores were diluted in buffers at different pH (100 mm KCl with one of the following: 50 mm MES for pH 5.5–6.5; MOPS for pH 7; EPPS for pH 7.5–8.5; CHES for pH 9–10), and the ambient potential was adjusted to take account of the pH dependence of the Q/QH2 couple so as to keep the quinone pool poised at the same ratio. Values over a range between ∼30% reduced (equivalent to Eh ∼100 mV at pH 7.0) and ∼85% reduced (equivalent to Eh ∼70 mV at pH 7.0) were tested in preliminary experiments (see supplemental Fig. S1). For comparison between mutant strains, we used conditions under which the Q-pool was 83% reduced. Under these conditions, the rate of QH2 oxidation was near maximal, and heme bH was mostly oxidized (∼76%). This protocol allowed for control of QH2 concentration while varying [ISPox], which changed with pH. The kinetic activities in the pH range below 8.5 were measured via the absorbance change due to cyt bH (as above). In higher pH ranges (≥8.5), because the Em of heme bH and the Q-pool overlap more (37.Dutton P.L. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 30: 495-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the kinetics were determined through electrochromic changes of carotenoids at 503 nm and were monitored in the absence of ionophores and antimycin A (12.Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 36.Crofts A.R. Shinkarev V.P. Kolling D.R. Hong S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36191-36201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The titration curve for stigmatellin inhibition of the bc1 complex was determined by measuring cyt bH reduction with the suspension at Eh ∼100 mV as above, by following the change in amplitude with increasing concentrations of the inhibitor on flash activation in the presence of antimycin A. Michaelis-Menten treatment of the dependence of the Qo-site reaction on [QH2] was based on the known Em value for the Q/QH2 couple, the total [Q + QH2], the Q/QH2 value calculated at each experimental Eh, and allowance for ∼1 QH2/2 RC generated in the flash. Values used in this analysis were an Em,7 for the Q/QH2 couple of 90 mV in R. sphaeroides (38.Takamiya K.I. Dutton P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 546: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and a ratio between the quinone pool and the RC of ∼30 Q/RC determined through quinone extraction and kinetic approaches (12.Crofts A.R. Meinhardt S.W. Jones K.R. Snozzi M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 723: 202-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 34.Snozzi M. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It was assumed that this ratio would be constant for all the mutant strains because there is no genetic interference in the expression of the RC and quinone synthesis in the strains used in this work. However, because all the bc1 complexes in this work were expressed trans-allelically, and cells were grown under tetracycline selection, the stoichiometries of redox components varied somewhat. To control for this, ratios of bc1 complex to RC were determined from the absorbance change of RC, and hemes bH, bL, and (c1 + c2) in kinetic experiments following excitation by 8 closely spaced flashes in the presence of 1 mm ascorbic acid (as reductant for the high potential chain), 2 mm KCN to inhibit cyt c2 oxidation through oxidase activities, and 10 μm antimycin to block reoxidation of the b-hemes. The concentrations of reduced QH2 and the bc1 complex in the membrane before flash activation were obtained assuming [RC]membrane of ∼2 mm (34.Snozzi M. Crofts A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 766: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and by substituting values for reactants into the Nernst equation. We then used values for [QH2] at different ambient potentials in Hanes-Woolf plots to estimate Km and Vmax values. The Km values reported ignore possible competitive effects from changes in [Q] (39.Covián R. Pardo J.P. Moreno-Sánchez R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48449-48455Abstract Full T"

We hypothesized that the activity of DDX5 in regulating fibrogenic gene transcription in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is altered by the S480A SNP. To test this, we employed two approaches: 1) transient overexpression of DDX5 cDNA or siRNA knockdown of endogenous DDX5, with replacement by either DDX5 wild type (WT) or SNP cDNA, or 2) stable expression of exogenous DDX5 WT and SNP in HSC lines. WT DDX5 mRNA in HSCs was inversely correlated with gene expression for α2(I) collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and transforming growth factor-β1. Stable DDX5 SNP-expressing cells had higher basal and transforming growth factor-β1-stimulated expression and enhanced promoter activities of fibrogenic genes. DDX5 variant-expressing cells also had higher Smad3 and AP-1-responsive reporter activities. In a one-hybrid GAL4 system, co-expression of the DDX5 SNP variant with chimeras of GAL4 DNA binding domain linked to JunD or Sp1 displayed higher transactivation of a GAL4-responsive reporter than that of DDX5 WT. Increased fibrogenic gene expression in DDX5 SNP-expressing cells was associated with reduced recruitment of DDX5 homodimers to responsive promoters, but there was no difference in the recruitment of the co-repressor HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1). These data suggest that DDX5 is a repressor of fibrogenic genes in HSCs through interaction with transcriptional complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2016610805,"Linoleate diol synthases (LDS) are heme enzymes, which oxygenate 18:2n-6 sequentially to (8R)-hydroperoxylinoleic acid ((8R)-HPODE) and to (5S,8R)-dihydroxy-, (7S,8S)-dihydroxy-, or (8R,11S)-dihydroxylinoleic acids (DiHODE). The genome of the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, contains two genes with homology to LDS. M. oryzae oxidized 18:2n-6 to (8R)-HPODE and to (7S,8S)-DiHODE, (6S,8R)-DiHODE, and (8R,11S)-HODE. Small amounts of 10-hydroxy-(8E,12Z)-octadecadienoic acid and traces of 5,8-DiHODE were also detected by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The contribution of the 7,8-LDS gene to M. oryzae pathogenicity was evaluated by replacement of the catalytic domain with hygromycin and green fluorescent protein variant (SGFP) cassettes. This genetically modified strain Delta7,8-LDS infected rice leaves and roots and formed appressoria and conidia as the native fungus. The Delta7,8-LDS mutant had lost the capacity to biosynthesize all the metabolites except small amounts of 8-hydroxylinoleic acid. Studies with stereospecifically deuterated linoleic acids showed that (8R)-HPODE was formed by abstraction of the pro-S hydrogen at C-8 and antarafacial oxygenation, whereas (7S,8S)-DiHODE and (8R,11S)-DiHODE were formed from (8R)-HPODE by suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation at C-7 and C-11, respectively. A mac1 suppressor mutant (Delta mac1 sum1-99) of M. oryzae, which shows cAMP-independent protein kinase A activity, oxygenated 18:2n-6 to increased amounts of (10R)-HPODE and (5S,8R)-DiHODE. Expression of the 7,8-LDS gene but not of the second homologue was detected in the suppressor mutant. This suggests that PKA-mediated signaling pathway regulates the dioxygenase and hydroperoxide isomerase activities of M. oryzae."
https://openalex.org/W1983251003,"Under normal conditions, the regeneration of mouse beta cells is mainly dependent on their own duplication. Although there is evidence that pancreatic progenitor cells exist around duct, whether non-beta cells in the islet could also potentially contribute to beta cell regeneration in vivo is still controversial. Here, we developed a novel transgenic mouse model to study the pancreatic beta cell regeneration, which could specifically inhibit beta cell proliferation by overexpressing p21(cip) in beta cells via regulation of the Tet-on system. We discovered that p21 overexpression could inhibit beta-cell duplication in the transgenic mice and these mice would gradually suffer from hyperglycemia. Importantly, the recovery efficiency of the p21-overexpressing mice from streptozotocin-induced diabetes was significantly higher than control mice, which is embodied by better physiological quality and earlier emergence of insulin expressing cells. Furthermore, in the islets of these streptozotocin-treated transgenic mice, we found a large population of proliferating cells which expressed pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) but not markers of terminally differentiated cells. Transcription factors characteristic of early pancreatic development, such as Nkx2.2 and NeuroD1, and pancreatic progenitor markers, such as Ngn3 and c-Met, could also be detected in these islets. Thus, our work showed for the first time that when beta cell self-duplication is repressed by p21 overexpression, the markers for embryonic pancreatic progenitor cells could be detected in islets, which might contribute to the recovery of these transgenic mice from streptozotocin-induced diabetes. These discoveries could be important for exploring new diabetes therapies that directly promote the regeneration of pancreatic progenitors to differentiate into islet beta cells in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2011431877,"The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes the extracellular formation of angiotensin II, and degradation of bradykinin, thus regulating blood pressure and renal handling of electrolytes. We have previously shown that exogenously added ACE elicited transcriptional regulation independent of its enzymatic activity. Because transcriptional regulation generates from protein-DNA interactions within the cell nucleus we have investigated the initial cellular response to exogenous ACE and the putative internalization of the enzyme in smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells (EC). The following phenomena were observed when ACE was added to cells in culture: 1) it bound to SMC and EC with high affinity (Kd = 361.5 ± 60.5 pm) and with a low binding occupancy (Bmax = 335.0 ± 14.0 molecules/cell); 2) it triggered cellular signaling resulting in late activation of focal adhesion kinase and SHP2; 3) it modulated platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β signaling; 4) it was endocytosed by SMC and EC; and 5) it transited through the early endosome, partially occupied the late endosome and the lysosome, and was localized to the nuclei. The incorporation of ACE or a fragment of it into the nuclei reached saturation at 120 min, and was preceded by a lag time of 40 min. Internalized ACE was partially cleaved into small fragments.

These enzymes are both type I transmembrane proteins consisting of an extended N-terminal extracellular domain and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (1.Wei L. Alhenc-Gelas F. Soubrier F.

Among the various peptide substrates of ACE in the extracellular space are angiotensin I leading to formation of angiotensin II, the effector hormone of the renin-angiotensin system, and bradykinin, which is degraded to inactive metabolites. As both are major contributors to cardiovascular regulation, inhibition of ACE has become the standard therapy for hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and heart failure (6.Gavras H. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 813-818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The classical peptidyl dipeptidase-dependent role of ACE proteins in the renin-angiotensin system has been recently broadened to areas of cell surface activity and transcriptional regulation. Thus, ACE has been shown to manifest a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein releasing activity (GPIase activity), which is independent of its peptidase activity and sheds various GPI-anchored proteins from the cell surface by cleavage within the GPI moiety, and is associated with its role in fertilization (7.Kondoh G. Tojo H. Nakatani Y. Komazawa N. Murata C. Yamagata K. Maeda Y. Kinoshita T. Okabe M. Taguchi R. Takeda J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It is not known if ACE acts directly on GPI-anchored proteins, or indirectly through another protein(s) (8.Leisle L. Parkin E.T. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Nat.

Hypertension. 2005; 45: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that exogenous ACE added to smooth muscle cells (SMC) resulted in transcriptional stimulation of the genes of bradykinin receptors B1 and B2 after 3–4 h (14.Ignjacev-Lazich I. Kintsurashvili E. Johns C. Vitseva O. Duka A. Shenouda S. Gavras I. Gavras H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H1814-H1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this transcriptional regulation by exogenous ACE may involve its nuclear localization. An early immunohistochemistry study showed that when the ACE cDNA was transfected into intact rat carotid arteries, ACE protein was localized in the SMC as well as in the intima endothelial cells (EC) (15.Morishita R. Gibbons G.H. Ellison K.E. Lee W. Zhang L. Yu H. Kaneda Y. Ogihara T. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A fact not mentioned in this report was that ACE appeared to be localized in the nuclei of SMC and EC. 4H. A. Lucero, E. Kintsurashvili, M. E. Marketou, and H. Gavras, unpublished data. In another early report an elevated endogenous expression of ACE in the abdominal aorta neointima SMC was observed in response to experimentally induced vascular injury (16.Rakugi H. Kim D.K. Krieger J.E. Wang D.S. Dzau V.J. Pratt R.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Remarkably, this injury-induced increment in ACE protein and activity was restricted to injured tissue and was not detected in serum or lung ACE levels. Thus, it is possible that SMC and EC can be exposed to locally produced exogenous ACE under certain pathophysiological conditions such as vascular injury. In a more recent report (17.Camargo de Andrade M. C Di Marco G.S. de Paulo Castro Teixeira V. Mortara R.A. Sabatini R.A. Pesquero J.B. Boim M.A. Carmona A.K. Schor N. Casarini D.E. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2006; 290: F364-F375Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using the 9B9 monoclonal antibody, ACE was detected inside cell nuclei of mesangial cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats where it colocalized with angiotensin II and angiotensin III. However, these previous reports neither enquire on the origin of the nuclear ACE, nor did they focus on the molecular mechanisms involved. Here we present characterization of the initial, intermediate, and late events of the interaction of exogenous ACE with SMC and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The binding of ACE to the cell surface was succeeded by its endocytosis to the early and late endosomes, the lysosome, and the nuclei. Nuclear localization of exogenous ACE coincided with changes in cell signaling response manifested as late activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and SHP2, as well as modulation of PDGFR-β signaling. 125I-Monoiodo Bolton-Hunter reagent was from Amersham Biosciences. ACE was purified from pig kidney cortex as described elsewhere (18.Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 625-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). BSA (≥98.0% pure) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against phosphoproteins of the PDGFR-β signal transduction pathway are described in the text. The source of other reagents are as indicated. Rat aorta SMC were isolated and expanded as described (14.Ignjacev-Lazich I. Kintsurashvili E. Johns C. Vitseva O. Duka A. Shenouda S. Gavras I. Gavras H. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2005; 289: H1814-H1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 7.5 × 104 cell/ml in 2 ml of medium per well of a 6-well plate. Freshly isolated cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modifies Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The normal rat lung fetal fibroblast cell line RFL-6 (American Type Culture Collection) was cultured and propagated as described above for SMC. Pooled HUVEC (Lonza Walkersville Inc.) were cultured and propagated as described above for SMC in complete endothelial basal medium 2. Cell counting was carried out by hemocytometry in triplicate cultures using the trypan blue exclusion method. ACE was iodinated using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (19.Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of freeze-dried, affinity purified ACE was resuspended in 50 μl of 100 mm sodium borate, pH 8.5, and added to [125I]monoiodo-Bolton-Hunter reagent (1000 μCi), which had been dried under nitrogen and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. 200 μl of quenching solution (0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, and 0.2 m glycine) was added and the mixture incubated for an additional 10 min at 4 °C followed by addition of 50 μl of 100 mm sodium borate containing 5 mg/ml of BSA. Two 5-μl aliquots of the mixture were used to assess the efficiency of iodination and the remaining 295 μl was loaded onto a 5-ml d-salt polyacrylamide desalting column (6 kDa cut-off, Pierce) that had been equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mg/ml of BSA. Fractions of 500 μl were collected and 125I-ACE was eluted in the first peak of radioactivity (fractions 4th to 6th) with 25,000 cpm/ng of specific radioactivity. 125I-ACE retained around 70% of its enzymatic activity. BSA (50 μg/50 μl of 100 mm borate buffer, pH 8.5) was iodinated under similar conditions, except that BSA was not included in the buffers used after addition of the quenching solution. Binding of 125I-ACE was measured in monolayers of cells grown in 24-well cluster culture plates. Cells were seeded on the plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well, grown to near confluence, starved in serum-free medium for 48 h, washed three times with cold binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm CaCl2, containing 2 mg/ml of BSA), and incubated in 1 ml of binding buffer for 30 min at 4 °C. The binding buffer was aspirated and 1 ml of fresh binding buffer containing the indicated concentrations of 125I-ACE at a specific radioactivity of 88,000 cpm/ng was added and further incubated at 4 °C for 4 h. After washing four times with 1 ml of binding buffer at 4 °C, cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml of BSA. Radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of unlabeled ACE at 500 ng/ml. Specific binding was obtained by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. The dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum binding capacity (Bmax) for 125I-ACE were determined by least squares non-linear regression fitting of the hyperbolic function for ligand binding to one-site saturation. Cell numbers were determined in triplicate parallel cultures by trypsinization and counting the detached cells in a hemocytometer. To assess if iodination of ACE induced polymerization (aggregation), the native molecule (0.5 μg) and its iodinated form (125I-ACE containing 105 cpm) were subjected to gel filtration chromatography in a HiPrep Sephacryl S-300 using aprotinin (6.5 kDa), cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (28 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and apoferritin (481 kDa) as molecular mass markers. The column was equilibrated and resolved in PBS, pH 7.4. The elution patterns of native ACE and 125I-ACE were monitored by determining ACE activity and radioactivity, respectively. ACE activity was assayed in medium (50 μl) containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, and the quenched fluorogenic substrate Abz-XXK(Dnp)P (10 μm). The activity was monitored continuously in a fluorescence microplate reader at 320/420 nm. The activation of SHP2, AKT, FAK, PDGFR-β, and ERK1/ERK2 (p44/42 MAPK) by exogenously added ACE to cell monolayers was assessed by monitoring their phosphorylated state using specific anti-phosphoprotein. Cells grown to confluence on 6-well plates were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium and preincubated without or with 10 nm ACE for 120 min. Then cells were stimulated with: 10 nm ACE, 2 nm PDGF-BB, or 2 nm PDGF-BB in the presence of 10 nm ACE, for the indicated times at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. The reaction was stopped by aspirating the medium, and cells were immediately lysed with 200 μl/well of extraction buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μl/ml of protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell extracts were sonicated to break down genomic DNA, clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were saved. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using BSA as the standard. Total protein extracts (30 μg/lane) were resolved by 4.0–20.0% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol using a Mini Trans-Blot blotter (Bio-Rad) at 30 V overnight and under continuous cooling at 4 °C. Blots were blocked in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight with gentle agitation at 4 °C with a mixture of the anti-phosphoprotein antibodies, anti-P-SHP2, anti-P-AKT, anti-P-ERK1/ERK2 (p44/42 MAPK), anti-P-FAK, and anti-P-PDGFR-β, each diluted 1:1000 in PBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS/T) and 5% (w/v) BSA. Membranes were washed three times for 5 min each with PBS/T buffer and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000) in PBS/T, 5% (w/v) BSA. After washing four times for 10 min each with PBS/T, membranes were developed with a chemiluminescence substrate for detection of horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and images were captured in a Chemi Doc XRS imager (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One version 4.6 imaging software. ACE and BSA (90 μg/200 μl) were diluted in 200 mm sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.0, and reacted with 0.5 mg of TRITC for 1 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1.5 m hydroxylamine, with further incubation for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, TRITC-ACE and TRITC-BSA were separated from unreacted TRITC by two passages through a 5-ml d-salt polyacrylamide desalting column as described above. The resulting TRITCT-ACE retained around 80% of its enzymatic activity. Cells were grown in the wells of the Nunc Lab-Tek II CC2 Chamber Slide System to ∼80% confluence under the conditions as described herein, including starvation in serum-free medium and washing steps. Cells were fixed in PBS containing 3% formaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, incubated for 10 min at room temperature in PBS containing 10 mm ammonium chloride to quench the excess of formaldehyde, and then washed twice with PBS. For detection of late endosome and lysosome, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 1:200 dilution of the commercially available primary antibodies indicated in the corresponding figures. Then slides were incubated with 1:1000 dilution of FITC-labeled commercially available secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature and rinsed three times with PBS solution. Slides were mounted on Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting solution containing DAPI and fluorescent images were captured using a ×60 NA 0.5–1.25 oil objective on an inverted Nikon TE-2000 microscope with a Photometrics Cool SNAP HQ camera. Images were captured using NIS-Elements software (Nikon) and processed with a three-dimensional deconvolution plug-in (Media Cybernetics) in ImageJ. Time lapse live cell imaging was performed using the Live Cell device (Pathology Devices) adapted to the Nikon TE-2000 microscope for feedback control of temperature, CO2, and humidity. Images presented in the figures are representative of 15 fields observed by scanning the entire slide area. Imaging was done in the BUMC Cellular Imaging Core Facility. SMC were grown to 80% confluence, serum starved for 24 h in serum-free DMEM, and incubated in the same medium with 100 μCi of [3H]thymidine at 37 °C or with 10 nm (100 μCi) 125I-ACE for 120 min at 37 and 4 °C. In some experiments cells were preincubated for 30 min with inhibitors of endocytosis before incubation with 125I-ACE. The inhibitors used were: 3 μm phenylarsine oxide, 100 μg/ml of concanavalin A, 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin, 200 μm monodansyl cadaverin, 10.0 μm amiloride, 10.0 μg/ml of dextran sulfate, 2.0 μg/ml of polyinosine, and 20.0 μg/ml of fucoidan. Cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) and disrupted mechanically by homogenization in a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes on ice) in an isotonic grinding medium (0.5 ml/60-mm plate) containing 250 mm sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (50 μl/20 ml), 200 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in dimethyl sulfoxide (50 μl/20 ml), and 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent. Nuclei and cell debris were recovered by centrifugation for 10 min at 1,000 × g. The supernatant, referred to as the cytoplasmic fraction, was saved at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was gently re-suspended in 500 μl of isotonic grinding medium and loaded on top of a discontinuous Opti-Prep gradient by diluting the original 60% solution in medium containing 150 mm KCl, 30 mm MgCl2, and 120 mm Tricine, pH 7.8. The gradient was composed of three layers of 15 (2 ml), 20 (5 ml), and 35% (2 ml) loaded on a 14-ml Sorvall SH80 rotor tube. Samples were spun down for 60 min at 10,000 × g and purified nuclei were recovered from the 20/35% interface. Finally, purified nuclei were diluted 10 times with grinding buffer without detergent and recovered by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was suspended in a minimal volume of grinding medium without detergent and the number of nuclei was determined in 10 μl of this suspension after adding 10 μm DAPI. Nuclei were counted in a hemocytometer chamber using a fluorescent Nikon Eclipse E400 microscope. Alternatively protein content of the purified nuclei was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method (Pierce). This method was also applied to the study of subcellular distribution of internalized 125I-ACE and the effect of 3 nm leptomycin B (LMB) on nuclear localization of 125I-ACE presented in Fig. 8. In those studies cells were incubated with 10 nm ACE containing 6.0 × 105 cpm. SMC were incubated with 10 nm (100 μCi) 125I-BSA for 120 min at 37 °C, in the absence (control) or presence of the indicated inhibitors, as described above for internalization of 125I-ACE. Non-internalized 125I-BSA was eliminated by three washes with HBSS medium at 4 °C. Cell were solubilized with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml of BSA, and radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. Nuclei from SMC cells were prepared as described above. The nuclei (500 μg of protein) were suspended in 1.0 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, Sigma protease inhibitor mixture (50 μl/20 ml), 200 μg/ml of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in dimethyl sulfoxide (50 μl/20 ml), 250 μg/ml of heparin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 400 units of Benzon Nuclease (Merck). After mild stirring for 90 min at 4 °C, nuclear envelopes were sedimented by centrifugation (10,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended in a buffer containing 0.25 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Na3VO4, and the protease inhibitors indicated above). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). SMC were grown in 60-mm plates to ∼80% confluence, rinsed twice with HBSS, and starved for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. After addition of fresh serum-free DMEM, ACE was added at a final concentration of 10 nm containing 2.0 × 106 cpm of 125I-ACE and incubated for the indicated times (see Fig. 11) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Nuclei were isolated and counted as described above. The radioactivity in samples containing 105 nuclei was measured in a γ-counter. For in vitro analysis of ACE degradation by cathepsin D, 125I-ACE (10 ng, containing 25,000 cpm/ng) was incubated with 0.1 units of cathepsin D (R&D Systems) in 25 μl of 100 mm glycine HCl, pH 4.5, at 37 °C for the indicated time intervals (see Fig. 12). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2 μl of 100 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in dimethyl sulfoxide and 10 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. Samples (35 μl) were resolved in a 4.0–20.0% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. The analysis of intracellular degradation of ACE was carried out as follows: SMC were grown to 80% confluence in 10-mm plates, serum-starved for 24 h, and rinsed three times with HBSS buffer and serum starved as indicated above. Cells were preincubated with pepstatin A (10 μg/ml) in serum-free DMEM or DMEM alone (control) for 2 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Then 125I-ACE (400 ng/ml, containing 2,000 cpm/ng) was added to the cells and further incubated for an additional 120 h. Cell plates were placed at 4 °C and rinsed four times with cold HBSS medium to eliminate the bulk of the extracellular 125I-ACE. Finally, cell monolayers were dispersed and their total protein content determined as indicated above. Samples (30 μg) in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol were resolved in 4.0–20.0% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography at −80 °C using a Bio-Max TranScreen HE (Kodak). The binding of 125I-ACE to SMC monolayers was studied in the absence and presence of excess non-labeled ACE, to determine the characteristics of total binding and nonspecific binding, respectively. The nonspecific binding of 125I-ACE displayed a linear increment, reaching around 25% of the total binding at 3000 pm125I-ACE (Fig. 1A). The specific binding, obtained by subtraction of nonspecific binding from total binding, displayed the characteristics of a saturable, single binding site process, with affinity (Kd) of 361.5 ± 60.5 pm in the occupancy (Bmax) of 335.0 ± 14.2 molecules/cell (Fig. 1B). These binding parameters are characteristics of a high affinity (picomolar range), low-abundance receptor involved in binding. Scatchard plot analysis revealed a linear correlation (Fig. 1B, inset), suggesting the lack of cooperativity for binding of ACE to the cells. Iodinated ACE was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography to assess a putative acquisition of a quaternary structure induced by iodination, a phenomenon that would have a significant effect on the Kd value. Both ACE and 125I-ACE eluted as a single peak of 191.0 kDa, close to the predicted value of 180 kDa (Fig. 1C). This result suggests that iodination of ACE does not alter its monomeric structure in solution. We next studied the possibility that ACE may trigger a signal within the cell by monitoring the putative activation of ubiquitous early responders to various growth factors, hormones, or cytokines. The experiments were designed to examine the effect of exogenous ACE on cells that were preincubated in the presence or absence of ACE for 120 min. We specifically focused on monitoring the putative activation of ubiquitous early responders to various growth factors, hormones, or cytokines. Signaling enzymes SHP2 and FAK were selected. SHP2 is a ubiquitous protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing Src homology 2 (SH2). It is a unique protein-tyrosine phosphatase that promotes activation, rather than down-regulation, of intracellular signaling pathways. SHP2 is considered a key signaling relay of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases, including the PDGF-R, fibroblast growth factor receptor, and epidermal growth factor receptor (20.Dance M. Montagner A. Salles J.P. Yart A. Raynal P. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). FAK is activated by a variety of cell surface receptors and participates in growth factor receptor-mediated signaling pathways, playing key roles in cell survival, proliferation, migration, and invasion (21.Schlaepfer D.D. Mitra S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). SMC that were not preincubated with ACE were then either treated with medium without ACE (control) or with exogenous ACE (+ACE) for the indicated time intervals. The time intervals were chosen to monitor early (5–60 min) and late (120–240 min) stages of activation. In general, background activation of FAK and SHP2 in the absence of added inducer is variable, depending on the cells and treatment preceding the induction assay. We have consistently observed that aorta smooth muscle cells are resilient to reach quiescence under serum deprivation. This reflects on the background level of activation of certain signaling molecules including SHP2 and FAK (Fig. 2A"

Previously, it has been shown that the Gis1 transcription factor is responsible for regulating the expression of postdiauxic shift genes in response to nutrient starvation, and this transcription regulation is dependent upon the Rim15 kinase. Here we demonstrate that the activity of Gis1 is negatively modulated by proteasome-mediated limited proteolysis. Limited degradation of Gis1 by the proteasome leads to the production of smaller variants, which have weaker transcription activities than the full-length protein. The coiled-coil domain, absent from the smaller variants, is part of the second transcription activation domain in Gis1 and is essential for both the limited proteolysis of Gis1 and its full activity. Endogenous Gis1 and its variants, regardless of their transcription capabilities, activate transcription in a Rim15-dependent manner. However, when the full-length Gis1 accumulates in cells due to overexpression or inhibition of the proteasome function, transcription activation by Gis1 is no longer solely controlled by Rim15. Together, these data strongly indicate that the function of the limited degradation is to ensure that Gis1-dependent transcription is strictly regulated by the Rim15 kinase. Furthermore, we have revealed that the kinase activity of Rim15 is essential for this regulation. The transcriptional response to environmental changes has to be prompt but appropriate.

Yeast cells, when starved for any of the core macronutrients (including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) cease growth, arrest cell cycle progression prior to “start,” and enter a poorly defined G0 state. In order to survive an extended period of starvation, during the transition to the stationary phase, cells also acquire a set of characteristics typical of the stationary phase. These include accumulation of storage carbohydrates (glycogen and trehalose), increased resistance to a variety of environmental stresses, and thickening of the cell wall (1.Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2.Gray J.V. Petsko G.A. Johnston G.C. Ringe D. Singer R.A. Werner-Washburne M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, when cells are subject to starvation for non-core nutrients, such as auxotrophic supplements, they fail to arrest uniformly as unbudded cells and lose their viability rapidly (3.Saldanha A.J. Brauer M.J. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4089-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, entry into the quiescent G0 state requires the cells to sense the availability of core nutrients and coordinate the cellular activities with their depletion rather than simply the cessation of growth (4.Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar).The conserved signaling pathways, Ras/cAMP and TOR, which sense the presence of nutrients and regulate growth (5.Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Both protein kinase A and TOR have been shown to regulate entry into the G0 phase of the cell cycle, converging on common targets, the Rim15 kinase and the downstream effectors. Consistent with this, the rim15Δ mutants exhibit many of the stationary phase defects, including diminished accumulation of trehalose and glycogen, decreased thermotolerance, reduced expression of stress response genes, and failure to arrest prior to S phase (11.Reinders A.

Eukaryot. Cell. 2004; 3: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Similarly, the expression of Gis1-dependent genes is also controlled by the protein kinase A, Sch9, and TOR signaling pathways (12.Pedruzzi I. Dubouloz F. Cameroni E. Wanke V. Roosen J. Winderickx J. De Virgilio C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1607-1613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 21.Pedruzzi I. Bürckert N. Egger P. De Virgilio C.

Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 862-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the means whereby the activity of Gis1 is controlled remains to be elucidated.Previously, we discovered a group of genes whose transcription was elevated significantly upon starvation for any of the core macronutrients, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur (23.Wu J. Zhang N. Hayes A. Panoutsopoulou K. Oliver S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3148-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We termed these UES genes (for universally expressed at starvation). Bioinformatic and transcript analysis confirmed that the expression of many of these genes is dependent on the Gis1 transcription factor (24.Zhang N. Wu J. Oliver S.G. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 1690-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that Rim15 and Gis1 are indispensable at both diauxic and postdiauxic shift phases, suggesting that they are responsible for regulating the transition from exponential growth to quiescence (24.Zhang N. Wu J. Oliver S.G. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 1690-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Gis1 has been shown to function as a transcription repressor (25.Jang Y.K. Wang L. Sancar G.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7630-7638Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26.Oshiro J. Han G.S. Iwanyshyn W.M. Conover K. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Although the repression function of Gis1 may be independent of the control by Rim15 (24.Zhang N. Wu J. Oliver S.G. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 1690-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the transcription activation by Gis1 is strictly dependent on Rim15 (16.Cameroni E. Hulo N. Roosen J. Winderickx J. De Virgilio C. Cell Cycle. 2004; 3: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 21.Pedruzzi I. Bürckert N. Egger P. De Virgilio C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22.Roosen J. Engelen K. Marchal K. Mathys J. Griffioen G. Cameroni E. Thevelein J.M. De Virgilio C. De Moor B. Winderickx J.

Here, we have demonstrated that Gis1 is subject to proteasome-mediated selective proteolysis to decrease the level of the full-length Gis1 and produce less active smaller fragments. The coiled-coil domain in Gis1 is identified as the essential element for both the limited proteolysis and its full activity. The function of the limited degradation is to ensure that Gis1-dependent transcription is strictly regulated by the Rim15 kinase. Failure of the degradation, as a result of GIS1 overexpression or inactivation of the proteasome function, leads to accumulation of the full-length Gis1 and transcription activation of Gis1 target genes in the rim15 mutants. These data indicate that there are Rim15-independent factors that promote the activity of the full-length Gis1. Furthermore, we have revealed that the kinase activity of Rim15 is essential for its function in regulating the transcription activity of Gis1. Together, these findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms by which the G0-specific transcription is modulated in response to nutrient depletion.DISCUSSIONThe transcriptional response to nutrient starvation and stress involves a large proportion of the genome (42.Gasch A.P. Werner-Washburne M. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 2: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). An appropriate response to environmental changes ensures proper utilization of cellular resources and, indeed, cell growth and survival. In this study, we have demonstrated that starvation-specific transcription activated by the Gis1 transcription factor is negatively controlled by the proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Limited degradation of Gis1 by the proteasome is constitutive during all the growth phases to reduce the level of the full-length protein (Fig. 1B), which has a much higher transcriptional proficiency than the smaller fragments (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). The biological function of the degradation is to ensure that the transcription of Gis1 target genes is strictly regulated by the Rim15 kinase. Based on our work and that of others, we propose a model of how the activity of Gis1 is modulated (Fig. 8).Transcription activation by endogenous Gis1 or its variants is strictly regulated by the Rim15 kinase, regardless of their transcription capabilities (Fig. 5, C and D) (21.Pedruzzi I. Bürckert N. Egger P. De Virgilio C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22.Roosen J. Engelen K. Marchal K. Mathys J. Griffioen G. Cameroni E. Thevelein J.M. De Virgilio C. De Moor B. Winderickx J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 862-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24.Zhang N. Wu J. Oliver S.G. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 1690-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GIS1 induces the accumulation of the full-length protein (Fig. 6A) and the expression of starvation-specific genes (Fig. 6B) in exponentially growing cells. Activation of these genes under the same conditions is only moderately attenuated in rim15 deletion cells (Fig. 6E). Similarly, the β-galactosidase activity activated by F1R1 (expressed from the strong ADH1 promoter) was only reduced by 20% in rim15 mutant cells as compared with that in the wild-type cells (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, when the proteasome function is inactivated, the full-length Gis1 (endogenous) accumulates (Fig. 1D), and the transcription of SSA3 is highly activated in rim15 mutant cells treated with rapamycin (compare Figs. 2, E and F, and 7, A and B). Together, these data strongly indicate that the function of the selective degradation is to ensure that the transcription activated by endogenous Gis1 and its variants is strictly modulated by the Rim15 kinase. The Gis1 protein, constitutively located in the nucleus (22.Roosen J. Engelen K. Marchal K. Mathys J. Griffioen G. Cameroni E. Thevelein J.M. De Virgilio C. De Moor B. Winderickx J. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 862-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), is required for activation of a set of genes that are universally expressed in cells starved for different core nutrients, including glucose, ammonium, and phosphate (23.Wu J. Zhang N. Hayes A. Panoutsopoulou K. Oliver S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3148-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 24.Zhang N. Wu J. Oliver S.G. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 1690-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Given that the kinase activity of Rim15 is negatively regulated by protein kinase A (11.Reinders A. Bürckert N. Boller T. Wiemken A. De Virgilio C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2943-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and that its nuclear localization is antagonized by the TOR (12.Pedruzzi I. Dubouloz F. Cameroni E. Wanke V. Roosen J. Winderickx J. De Virgilio C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1607-1613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and Pho80/Pho85 (15.Wanke V. Pedruzzi I. Cameroni E. Dubouloz F. De Virgilio C. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4271-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) signaling pathways, the control exerted by the Rim15 kinase may enable cells to respond to starvation of different macronutrients and thus different nutrient-sensing pathways (Fig. 8), including glucose (protein kinase A), ammonium (TOR), and phosphate (Pho80/Pho85).Transcription activation of Gis1 targets was seen in rim15 mutant cells overexpressing Gis1 (Fig. 5E) and in rim15 deletion cells treated with both rapamycin and the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 7, A and B), indicating that Rim15-independent factors (denoted by a question mark in Fig. 8) are involved in promoting the activity of the full-length Gis1. Because the SSA3 transcript level was not significantly induced in rim15Δ cells treated with rapamycin or the proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 7, A and B), the effect of this factor(s) on Gis1-dependent transcription is probably determined by both the nutrient status and the amount of full-length Gis1 protein. Therefore, the transcription activity of Gis1 in vivo is modulated by at least three factors (Fig. 8): the proteasome, the Rim15 kinase, and the yet to be identified regulator(s).The transcription activity of Gis1 and its variants is regulated by Rim15 in cells grown exponentially (Figs. 5A and 6E), in cells treated with rapamycin (Fig. 5, A, C, and D), and in cells starved for glucose (21.Pedruzzi I. Bürckert N. Egger P. De Virgilio C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The kinase activity of Rim15 is essential for its function (Table 1 and Fig. 7, C and D), indicating that the regulation of its kinase activity and nuclear localization by nutrients and the signaling pathways (12.Pedruzzi I. Dubouloz F. Cameroni E. Wanke V. Roosen J. Winderickx J. De Virgilio C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1607-1613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 14.Wanke V. Cameroni E.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4271-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21.Pedruzzi I. Bürckert N. Egger P. De Virgilio C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2569-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) may be more quantitative than qualitative. Intriguingly, Pedruzzi et al. (12.Pedruzzi I. Dubouloz F. Cameroni E. Wanke V. Roosen J. Winderickx J. De Virgilio C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1607-1613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) reported that the localization of Rim15 in the nucleus and the transcription of SSA3 was observed when half of the initial glucose in the medium was consumed, independent of the absolute glucose concentration. It will be interesting to decide how the signaling pathways (protein kinase A, TOR, and Pho80/Pho85) sense the kinetics of nutrient signals and how they impinge on the Rim15 kinase cooperatively in response to depletion of different core nutrients. Because Rim15 regulates the transcriptional activity of Gis1 at different nutrient conditions (Figs. 5 (A, C, and D) and 6E) and within different genomic contexts (4lexAop-HIS3, 8lexAop-lacZ (Fig. 5, A and B) and SSA3, GRE1 (Fig. 5, C and D)), it is possible that Rim15 exerts its effects on Gis1 directly through phosphorylation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Rim15 controls Gis1 activity indirectly through chromatin modification as demonstrated previously (43.Pnueli L. Edry I. Cohen M. Kassir Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5197-5208Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Experimental work is currently ongoing to determine the mode of action of Rim15 on the activity of Gis1.Proteasome-mediated degradation can be either ubiquitin-dependent or ubiquitin-independent. Ubiquitination generally serves as a signal to target short lived proteins for degradation. We have failed to detect ubiquitination of Gis1 using an anti-ubiquitin antibody (data not shown), suggesting that selective degradation of Gis1 may be ubiquitin-independent. An increasing number of proteins have been found to be degraded by the proteasome without their ubiquitination (44.Jariel-Encontre I. Bossis G. Piechaczyk M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 153-177PubMed Google Scholar), and such proteins may compromise as much as 20% of cellular proteins in eukaryotic cells (45.Baugh J.M. Viktorova E.G. Pilipenko E.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 386: 814-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Proteasome degradation requires both substrate association with the proteasome and the presence of an unstructured peptide within the substrate to facilitate the initiation of proteolysis (46.Takeuchi J. Chen H. Coffino P. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here we have demonstrated that the coiled-coil domain is critical for the limited proteolysis of Gis1 by the proteasome (Fig. 3, D and E), suggesting that the structural constraint imposed by the coiled-coil domain is crucial for this selective degradation. Limited proteolysis by either the 20 or 26 S proteasome has been reported to yield biologically active fragments, such as NF-κB1 (47.Moorthy A.K. Savinova O.V. Ho J.Q. Wang V.Y. Vu D. Ghosh G. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1945-1956Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and the two yeast paralogous transcription factors Spt23 and Mga2 (48.Hoppe T. Matuschewski K. Rape M. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. Cell. 2000; 102: 577-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Limited proteolysis of Gis1 by the proteasome acts to down-regulate its transcription activation activity. However, it is possible that the selective trimming of Gis1 also serves the purpose of producing functional products. First, the cleavage downstream of the coiled-coil domain releases the jumonji and coiled-coil domains. The jumonji domain has been shown to have histone demethylase activity (49.Tu S. Bulloch E.M. Yang L. Ren C. Huang W.C. Hsu P.H. Chen C.H. Liao C.L. Yu H.M. Lo W.S. Freitas M.A. Tsai M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 14262-14271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and interact with a number of proteins (50.Tronnersjö S. Hanefalk C. Balciunas D. Hu G.Z. Nordberg N. Murén E. Ronne H. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2007; 277: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Second, the expression of GRE1 is more severely compromised than that of SSA3 when the coiled-coil domain is removed from Gis1 (N592Δ (Fig. 2, B and C) and N400Δ (Fig. 3, F and G)), suggesting that cleavage of Gis1 at multiple sites may generate fragments that exert differential controls on the transcription of different genes.In cells starved for glucose or treated with rapamycin, the decreasing levels of full-length Gis1 and the largest variant (v1; Fig. 1, A and B) may be due to decreased translation efficiency, accelerated proteolysis, or both. The expression of the components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is induced during transition to stationary phase (42.Gasch A.P. Werner-Washburne M. Funct. Integr. Genomics. 2002; 2: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Enhanced proteasome activities during the early stages of glucose starvation have been shown in both yeast (51.Fujimuro M. Takada H. Saeki Y. Toh-e A Tanaka K. Yokosawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and cancer cells (52.Ogiso Y. Tomida A. Kim H.D. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 258: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, inhibition of the function of the proteasome affects the expression of 15% of the genome (41.Fleming J.A. Lightcap E.S. Sadis S. Thoroddsen V. Bulawa C.E. Blackman R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), including genes involved in protein degradation, mitochondrial function, and stress response and those implicated in amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis. These genes overlap significantly with those regulated by the TOR signaling pathway (53.Castrillo J.I. Zeef L.A. Hoyle D.C. Zhang N. Hayes A. Gardner D.C. Cornell M.J. Petty J. Hakes L. Wardleworth L. Rash B. Brown M. Dunn W.B. Broadhurst D. O'Donoghue K. Hester S.S. Dunkley T.P. Hart S.R. Swainston N. Li P. Gaskell S.J. Paton N.W. Lilley K.S. Kell D.B. Oliver S.G. J. Biol. 2007; 6: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains to be seen if and how the nutrient signaling pathways and the proteasome interact and cooperate to control gene expression on a wider scale. IntroductionCell growth is modulated in response to the availability of nutrients and growth factors. Yeast cells, when starved for any of the core macronutrients (including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur) cease growth, arrest cell cycle progression prior to “start,” and enter a poorly defined G0 state. In order to survive an extended period of starvation, during the transition to the stationary phase, cells also acquire a set of characteristics typical of the stationary phase. These include accumulation of storage carbohydrates (glycogen and trehalose), increased resistance to a variety of environmental stresses, and thickening of the cell wall (1.Herman P.K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 2.Gray J.V. Petsko G.A. Johnston G.C. Ringe D. Singer R.A. Werner-Washburne M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 187-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, when cells are subject to starvation for non-core nutrients, such as auxotrophic supplements, they fail to arrest uniformly as unbudded cells and lose their viability rapidly (3.Saldanha A.J. Brauer M.J. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4089-4104Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, entry into the quiescent G0 state requires the cells to sense the availability of core nutrients and coordinate the cellular activities with their depletion rather than simply the cessation of growth (4.Zaman S. Lippman S.I. Zhao X. Broach J.R. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 27-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar).The conserved signaling pathways, Ras/cAMP and TOR, which sense the presence of nutrients and regulate growth (5.Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Both protein kinase A and TOR have been shown to regulate entry into the G0 phase of the cell cycle, converging on common targets, the Rim15 kinase and the downstream effectors. Consistent with this, the rim15Δ mutants exhibit many of the stationary phase defects, including diminished accumulation of trehalose and glycogen, decreased thermotolerance, reduced expression of stress response genes, and failure to arrest prior to S phase (11.Reinders A. Bürckert N. Boller T. Wiemken A. De Virgilio C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2943-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). As a member of the PAS family, the kinase activity of Rim15 is negatively regulated by protein kinase A (11.Reinders A. Bürckert N. Boller T. Wiemken A. De Virgilio C.

https://openalex.org/W2014332587,"The ribosome from Escherichia coli requires a specific concentration of Mg(2+) to maintain the 70 S complex formation and allow protein synthesis, and then the structure must be stable and flexible. How does the ribosome acquire these conflicting factors at the same time? Here, we investigated the hydrogen/deuterium exchange of 52 proteins in the 70 S ribosome, which controlled stability and flexibility under various Mg(2+) concentrations, using mass spectrometry. Many proteins exhibited a sigmoidal curve for Mg(2+) concentration dependence, incorporating more deuterium at lower Mg(2+) concentration. By comparing deuterium incorporation with assembly, we have discovered a typical mechanism of complexes for acquiring both stability and flexibility at the same time. In addition, we got information of the localization of flexibility in ribosomal function by the analysis of related proteins with stalk protein, tRNA, mRNA, and nascent peptide, and demonstrate the relationship between structure, assembly, flexibility, and function of the ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W2027858030,"Background Insect eggshells must combine protection for the yolk and embryo with provisions for respiration and for the entry of sperm, which are ensured by aeropyles and micropyles, respectively. Insects which oviposit the eggs in an egg-case have a double problem of respiration as gas exchange then involves two barriers. An example of this situation is found in the cockroach Blattella germanica, where the aeropyle and the micropyle are combined in a complex structure called the sponge-like body. The sponge-like body has been well described morphologically, but nothing is known about how it is built up. Methodology/Principal Findings In a library designed to find genes expressed during late chorion formation in B. germanica, we isolated the novel sequence Bg30009 (now called Brownie), which was outstanding due to its high copy number. In the present work, we show that Brownie is expressed in the follicle cells localized in the anterior pole of the oocyte in late choriogenesis. RNA interference (RNAi) of Brownie impaired correct formation of the sponge-like body and, as a result, the egg-case was also ill-formed and the eggs were not viable.

Brownie is the first reported gene involved in the construction of complex eggshell respiratory structures."
https://openalex.org/W2044038766,"Insulin resistance can occur in response to many different external insults, including chronic exposure to insulin itself as well as other agonists such as dexamethasone. It is generally thought that such defects arise due to a defect(s) at an early stage in the insulin signaling cascade. One model suggests that this involves activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin/S6 kinase pathway, which inactivates insulin receptor substrate via Ser/Thr phosphorylation. However, we have recently shown that insulin receptor substrate is not a major node for insulin resistance defects. To explore the mechanism of insulin resistance, we have developed a novel system to activate Akt independently of its upstream effectors as well as other insulin-responsive pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinase. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were rendered insulin-resistant either with chronic insulin or dexamethasone treatment, but conditional activation of Akt2 stimulated hemagglutinin-tagged glucose transporter 4 translocation to the same extent in these insulin-resistant and control cells. However, addition of insulin to cells in which Akt was conditionally activated resulted in a reversion to the insulin-resistant state, indicating a feedforward inhibitory mechanism activated by insulin itself. This effect was overcome with wortmannin, implicating a role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in this inhibitory process. We conclude that in chronic insulin- and dexamethasone-treated cells, acute activation with insulin itself is required to activate a feedforward inhibitory pathway likely emanating from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase that converges on a target downstream of Akt to cause insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2003288654,"Information on specificities of serological responses against tumor cells in cutaneous lymphoma patients is relatively restricted. To advance the knowledge of serological immune responses against and to assess the scope of tumor antigenicity of cutaneous lymphoma, 1- and 2-dimensional Western blot analyses with sera from patients were combined with proteomics-based protein identification. Testing sera from 87 cutaneous lymphoma patients by 1-dimensional Western blot analysis, 64 cases of seroreactivity against lymphoma cells were found. The positive responses were relatively weak, restricted to few antigens in each case, and heterogeneous. To identify the antigens, proteins of the mycosis fungoides cell line MyLa and primary tumor cells were separated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, Western-blotted and probed with heterogeneous and autologous patient sera. The antigens were identified from silver-stained replica gels by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. 14 different antigens were assigned and identified with this proteome-serological approach. Only one, vimentin, had been reported before, the other 13 are new antigens for cutaneous lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2046235373,"Adaptive responses to novel toxic challenges provide selective advantages to organisms in evolution. Glutathione transferases (GSTs) play a pivotal role in the cellular defense because they are main contributors to the inactivation of genotoxic compounds of exogenous as well as of endogenous origins. GSTs are promiscuous enzymes catalyzing a variety of chemical reactions with numerous alternative substrates. Despite broad substrate acceptance, individual GSTs display pronounced selectivities such that only a limited number of substrates are transformed with high catalytic efficiency. The present study shows that minor structural changes in the C-terminal helix of mouse GST T1-1 induce major changes in the substrate-activity profile of the enzyme to favor novel chemical reactions and to suppress other reactions catalyzed by the parental enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1979024771,"PK 11195 and DAA1106 bind with high-affinity to the translocator protein (TSPO, formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor). TSPO expression in glial cells increases in response to cytokines and pathological stimuli. Accordingly, [(11)C]-PK 11195 and [(11)C]-DAA1106 are recognized molecular imaging (MI) agents capable of monitoring changes in TSPO expression occurring in vivo and in response to various neuropathologies.Here we tested the pharmacological characteristics and TSPO-monitoring potential of two novel MI agents: NIR-conPK and NIR-6T. NIR-conPK is an analogue of PK 11195 conjugated to the near-infrared (NIR) emitting fluorophore: IRDye 800CW. NIR-6T is a DAA1106 analogue also conjugated to IRDye 800CW.We found that NIR-6T competed for [(3)H]-PK 11195 binding in astrocytoma cell homogenates with nanomolar affinity, but did not exhibit specific binding in intact astrocytoma cells in culture, indicating that NIR-6T is unlikely to constitute a useful MI agent for monitoring TSPO expression in intact cells. Conversely, we found that NIR-conPK did not compete for [(3)H]-PK 11195 binding in astrocytoma cell homogenate, but exhibited specific binding in intact astrocytoma cells in culture with nanomolar affinity, suggesting that NIR-conPK binds to a protein distinct, but related to, TSPO. Accordingly, treating intact astrocytoma cells and microglia in culture with cytokines led to significant changes in the amount of NIR-conPK specific binding without corresponding change in TSPO expression. Remarkably, the cytokine-induced changes in the protein targeted by NIR-conPK in intact microglia were selective, since IFN-gamma (but not TNFalpha and TGFbeta) increased the amount of NIR-conPK specific binding in these cells.Together these results suggest that NIR-conPK binds to a protein that is related to TSPO, and expressed by astrocytomas and microglia. Our results also suggest that the expression of this protein is increased by specific cytokines, and thus allows for the monitoring of a particular subtype of microglia activation."
https://openalex.org/W2067370744,"We present a novel approach toward evolving artificial embryogenies, which omits the graph representation of gene regulatory networks and directly shapes the dynamics of a system, i.e., its phase space. We show the feasibility of the approach by evolving cellular differentiation, a basic feature of both biological and artificial development. We demonstrate how a spatial hierarchy formulation can be integrated into the framework and investigate the evolution of a hierarchical system. Finally, we show how the framework allows the investigation of allometry, a biological phenomenon, and its role for evolution. We find that direct evolution of allometric change, i.e., the evolutionary adaptation of the speed of system states on transient trajectories in phase space, is advantageous for a cellular differentiation task."
https://openalex.org/W2036254978,"For large scale studies aiming at a better understanding of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), sequence variation in particular mt haplogroups (hgs) and population structure, reliable low-cost high-throughput genotyping assays are needed. Furthermore, methods facilitating sensitive mixture detection and relative quantification of allele proportions are indispensable for the study of heteroplasmy, mitochondrial sequence evolution, and mitochondrial disorders. Here the properties of a homogeneous competitive duplex allele specific PCR (ARMS) assay were scrutinized in the light of these requirements.A duplex ARMS assay amplifying either the ancestral mtDNA 2706G allele (non-hg H samples) or the derived 7028C allele (hg H samples) in the presence of SYBR Green fluorescent reporter dye was developed and characterized. Product detection, allele calling, and hg inference were based on the amplicon-characteristic melting-point temperatures obtained with on-line post-PCR fluorescent dissociation curve analysis (DCA). The analytical window of the assay covered at least 5 orders of magnitude of template DNA input with a detection limit in the low picogram range of genomic DNA. A set of forensically relevant test specimens was analyzed successfully. The presence of mtDNA mixtures was detected over a broad range of input DNA amounts and mixture ratios, and the estimation of allele proportions in samples with known total mtDNA content was feasible with limitations. A qualified DNA analyst successfully analyzed approximately 2,200 DNA extracts within three regular working days, without using robotic lab-equipment. By performing the amplification on-line, the assay also facilitated absolute mtDNA quantification.Although this assay was developed just for a particular purpose, the approach is general in that it is potentially suitable in a broad variety of assay-layouts for many other applications, including the analysis of mixtures. Homogeneous ARMS-DCA is a valuable tool for large-volume studies targeting small numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)."
https://openalex.org/W2078648935,"Fab-PE38 used in this study is B3(Fab)-ext-PE38, and it is an antibody toxin that is made by fusing the Pseudomonas exotoxin to the Fab domain of B3 antibody. This antibody toxin selectively binds to cancer cells and kills the target cancer cells. B3(Fab)-ext-PE38 has a cysteine residue on the ext sequence, and (B3(Fab)-ext-PE38)(2) is the disulfide-bridged dimer of the B3(Fab)-ext-PE38 monomer. (B3(Fab)-ext-PE38)(2) has been found to have 11-fold higher cytotoxicity on the CRL-1739 cell line than monomeric B3(scFv)-PE38. We made a recombinant tandem repeat of the domain III of Streptococcal protein G that has Fab binding property up to seven repeats. Multiple monomers were found to form non-covalent complexes with this tandem repeat. Complexes were purified by size-exclusion chromatography, and we could enhance the production of the disulfide-bridged dimer by reduction and oxidation of the complexes. The tandem repeat makes close intermolecular interactions between monomers possible, and the use of it greatly enhances the yield of the disulfide-bridged dimer."
