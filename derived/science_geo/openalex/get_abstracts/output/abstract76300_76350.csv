These have been attributed to the continual accumulation of those products on the long-lived, slow-growing Arctic lichens and sedges. Such plants are an important source of forage for reindeer and caribou, the meat of which, in turn, constitutes a substantial portion of the diets of Laplanders and Eskimos. These high levels of fall-out suggest, together with the proposed mechanism of uptake and the similarities to strontium-90 in atmospheric distribution and biochemistry, that in Arctic biota, the naturally occurring airborne nuclides lead-210 and its decay product, polonium-210, may also be present in high concentration. These naturally occurring fall-out activities are of special interest in studies of aerosol precipitation mechanisms because their levels are independent of bomb tests and consequently they have been constant over the years. Because of this constancy and the high energy of the particles emitted by the lead-210 series (a 5.3-MeV ..cap alpha..-particle from polonium-210 and a 0.4-MeV (average energy) ..beta..-particle from bismuth-210 compared with ..beta..-rays with average energies of 0.4 MeV from cesium-137 and 1.1 MeV from strontium-90 (yttrium-90)), the radiation dose to Arctic biota from this source may be quite significant relative to that from artificial ones. 24 references."

It is often assumed that muscle tissue is an important site of non-shivering thermogenesis. Recently, Himms-Hagen2 has suggested that acceleration of the triglyceride cycle of brown adipose tissue is a major mechanism of non-shivering thermogenesis in cold-acclimatized rats. As lipid metabolism of adipose tissue is under β-adrenergic control, a study of the effect of β-adrenergic blockade on electrical muscle activity in rats exposed to about 4° C after acclimatization to 23° C or 4° C would be expected to yield valuable information. This communication presents preliminary data of such an investigation. Cold-acclimatized rats were removed from the cold room, anaesthetized with urethane (1 to 1.25 g/kg)—a drug known to alter only the degree, not the type, of the electrical response of muscle activity1—and exposed to a temperature of 4° C. Needle electrodes were inserted into a leg muscle and electrical activity was measured with a Grass model 5 polygraph3. Rectal temperature was monitored throughout the experiment. Each rat was tested at least twice, once when given drug treatment, and once when given saline or nothing. The β-adrenergic blocking agent, propranolol (AY 64043) (kindly donated by Ayerst, McKenna and Harrison, Ltd., Montreal), was used at doses of 0.3 or 0.9 mg/kg intraperitoneally every 30 min. Fig. 1 shows rectal temperature, duration of exposure to 4° C and the effect of the drug on electrical muscle activity in six cold-acclimatized rats. None of the animals shivered during an experimental period of 2.5 h when treated with saline. A seventh rat showed signs of shivering and was therefore excluded from this series. After treatment with propranolol, all six rats showed a marked increase of electrical muscle activity. Representative tracings of the muscle activity before and after propranolol are shown in Fig. 1: no effort was made to quantitate accurately the observed increase."

https://openalex.org/W1998999039,"THE standard method used for separating trypanosomes from infected blood involves repeated differential centrifugation of a suspension of trypanosomes and blood elements in a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing glucose. The success of this procedure varies not only from one species to another but also with the degree of parasitaemia. Suspensions of the Liverpool strain of Trypanosoma rhodesiense may be obtained free of red blood cells and leucocytes in this way, but with T. vivax, T. congolense, T. lewisi and the ‘M’ and ‘J’ strains of T. rhodesiense other techniques have to be used for complete removal of blood cells and platelets1,2."

https://openalex.org/W2002525780,"IN the course of an earlier investigation into the utilization of carotene by the rat as a source of vitamin A, it was noted that there was a consistent difference between the absorption spectra of the liver non-saponifiable fractions from those rats fed vitamin A and those fed a mixture of 90 per cent beta- and 10 per cent alpha-carotene1. This difference was in the magnitude of the absorbance at 311 mµ as compared with that at 326 mµ. The alpha-ionone analogue of vitamin A was afterwards synthesized2 and the absorption maxima were found to be at 311 mµ (E1%1cm, 1,650), and 325 mµ. (E1%1cm, 1,500). This alpha-vitamin A was found to be biologically inactive but was found to be stored in the liver in the same way as vitamin A (ref. 3)."

Since it was also noted that the drug slightly reduced the pH of the reaction mixture, the studies were extended to investigate the effect of pH. change on HuC′ activity."

https://openalex.org/W2052892909,"RECENT allograft experiments on rabbits in our laboratories prompted the development of a simple and safe anaesthetic technique which could be administered by the surgeon to two animals simultaneously. Inhalation techniques require the almost constant attention of another assistant; parenteral barbiturate administration requires repeated and increasingly difficult intravenous injections for maintenance. The following intravenous catheter and continuous technique were therefore devised, based on the standard technique of pentothal induction of anaesthesia in human surgery."
