https://openalex.org/W1971598138,"SINCE vitamin B6 is beneficial to rats treated with thyroxine1, the activity of some enzymes known to require pyridoxal-5-phosphate has been determined in the liver of rats treated with thyroxine."

https://openalex.org/W2068080560,"SEVERAL polysaccharides containing amino-sugars have been isolated from strains of Bacillus anthracis which contain polyglutamic acid in their capsular material1. However, no polysaccharides of a similar type have as yet been reported from the related B. subtilis strains which produce polyglutamic acid extracellularly."

https://openalex.org/W1978439716,"IN the past, numerous attempts to select strains of different plasmodia resistant to 4-amino-quinoline have been unsuccessful1. Recently, a successful attempt was recorded for Plasmodium gallinaceum, in which the resistance to chloroquine was found to be two-fold2. We have now succeeded in selecting a strain of mammalian plasmodium which is 200 times as tolerant to chloroquine as the parent strain."
https://openalex.org/W2074521488,"SINCE 1942 1, there has been an increase in the number of reports on haplomycosis in rodents and other animals trapped in the United States, Canada and England. Two recent reports from Canada and Sweden describing further isolations of the causative organism Haplosporangium were those published by Bakerspigel2 and Jellison3."
https://openalex.org/W1980263977,"IT was shown in a previous paper1 that lower fatty acids in molasses inhibit in their undissociated form the germination of Aspergillus niger spores. It is therefore not possible in the production of citric acid by fermentation of sugars from beet molasses to start with an acid substrate, as is usual in synthetic media ; the acids present, already at pH nearing 4.8, inhibit spore germination. Acetic acid shows the greatest differences in effect when changing from a neutral to an acid medium."

A. gambiae melas is a purely coastal species the larvae of which are relatively resistant to salt water, whereas those of A. gambiae gambiae are not3."

https://openalex.org/W2106521638,"THE interesting exchange between Profs. H. Dingle and W. H. McCrea1 on the subject of relativity and space flight has now produced a minor ripple in the United States2. Whether this is a precursor of a new controversy or just a highly attenuated wave, only future observations will show."

https://openalex.org/W2982847531,"IN a recent communication1, Mr. J. L. Gergen gives a brief account of his ‘black ball’ radiometer, and in comparing measurements of atmospheric radiation so made with those described by us2 states that they “are not in agreement”. A fuller account of our work has now appeared3 with more information than was available to him at the time of writing."
https://openalex.org/W2030625579,"CARNITINE (β-hydroxy-γ-butyrobetaine) stimulates the growth and the periosteal ossification of embryonic chick tibias and femurs cultivated in vitro 1,2 using the watch-glass technique3. This effect can be demonstrated if the embryo extract of the medium is diluted 20 or 200 times in Tyrode solution to get rid so far as possible of the natural carnitine always present in it (44–88 µgm./gm. dry weight for a 12-day-old chick embryo4). Measurements of the thickness of periosteal bone and counts of mitoses had indicated that the periosteum is a very sensitive site for the action of carnitine."
https://openalex.org/W2056334035,"STREPTOCOCCUS infection has not, to our knowledge, hitherto been the cause of mortality in gerbils (Tatera spp.) in South Africa. The following instance of such infection is therefore considered worthy of record."

https://openalex.org/W2088719200,"AT least fourteen species of lungworms have been described from domestic sheep in different parts of the world. Of these, only three are recorded as occurring in Great Britain, namely, Dictyocaulus filaria, Muellerius capillaris and Protostrongylus rufescens. A fourth lungworm, identified as Cystocaulus ocreatus, has recently been found in sheep lungs examined at Weybridge."
