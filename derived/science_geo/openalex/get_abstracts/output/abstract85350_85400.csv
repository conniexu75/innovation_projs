https://openalex.org/W2135380694,"We present the 9312 nucleotide sequence of the Prague C (Pr-C) strain of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV). A comparison of known protein sequences with the nucleotide sequence allows assignment of the coding regions for the gag, pol, env and src genes. The gag gene is terminated by an amber stop codon and is contained within a different reading frame than is the pol gene. The pol and env genes overlap. The sequences surrounding the src gene in the Pr-C and Schmidt-Ruppin (SR-A) strains of RSV have been compared, and they reveal that an element, E, of approximately 153 nucleotides is present on the 3' side of the src gene in Pr-C, and on the 5' side in SR-A. We hypothesize that E was part of a duplicated region of over 250 nucleotides flanking the src gene in an ancestral RSV, and that differential deletion of one copy of E led to its positional difference in Pr-C and SR-A."
https://openalex.org/W1990045705,"Cloned rabbit β-globin genes, modified in vitro by restructuring or site-directed mutagenesis, were introduced into mouse 3T6 cells, and the resulting transcripts were analyzed by nuclease S1 mapping. The first 109 bp preceding the cap site sufficed for maximal β-globin transcription. This segment contained three functionally important regions of the ATA box region; the CCAAT box region; and the −100 region. The latter consists of an imperfect tandemly repeated sequence of 14 bp and 15 bp, both copies of which are required for optimal promoter function. Each of the three regions contains two or more nucleotide positions where the introduction of point mutations reduces transcription by at least a factor of 2."
https://openalex.org/W2039610291,"We determined the nucleotide sequences of all coding regions and a significant part of the flanking regions of the chicken c-src gene, which is a cellular homolog of the v-src gene of Rous sarcoma virus. The c-src gene consists of 12 exons; the boundaries of the exons were determined by assuming that the amino acid sequence of its product, pp60c-src, is basically the same as that of pp60v-src. The deduced amino acid sequence of pp60c-src was very similar to that of pp60v-src, but the last 19 carboxy-terminal amino acids of pp60c-src were replaced by a new set of 12 amino acids of pp60v-src. The sequence encoding the carboxy-terminal sequence of pp60v-src was found 900 bp downstream from the termination codon of the c-src gene. We suggest that the c-src sequence was captured by a virus through recombination at both sides of the c-src gene, and that the recombinations occurred at the level of proviral DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2081731819,"We have identified genes that are expressed preferentially in either prestalk or prespore cells in Dictyostelium. The prestalk mRNAs are detectable at 7.5 hr prior to the completion of cell aggregation, while the prespore mRNAs are not detectable until ∼15 hr of development. Exogenous cAMP in the absence of sustained cell contact is sufficient to induce prestalk-specific gene expression, while multicellularity is required for the induction of prespore-specific genes. A gene expressed equally in both cell types, which has the same developmental kinetics as the prestalk genes, is induced in shaking culture in the absence of either cAMP or stable cell associations. Dissociation of aggregates results in the rapid loss of prespore- and prestalk-specific mRNAs, and these can be induced to reaccumulate with the addition of cAMP. We conclude that there are substantial differences in the timing and requirements for tissue-specific gene expression in Dictyostelium."

https://openalex.org/W2039607311,"The O-linked oligosaccharides on mature forms of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) glycoproteins were characterized, and were found to account largely for the lower electrophoretic mobilities of these forms relative to the mobilities of immature forms. Other posttranslational modifications of HSV1 glycoproteins (designated gB, gC, gD and gE) were related temporally to the discrete shifts in electrophoretic mobilities that signal acquisition of the O-linked oligosaccharides. Fatty acid acylation (principally of gE) could be detected just prior to the shifts, whereas conversion of high-mannose-type N-linked oligosaccharides to the complex type occurred coincident with the shifts. The addition of O-linked oligosaccharides did not occur in cells treated with the ionophore monensin or in a ricin-resistant cell line defective in the processing of N-linked oligosaccharides. We conclude that extension of O-linked oligosaccharide chains on HSV1 glycoproteins, and probably also attachment of the first O-linked sugars, occurs as a late posttranslational modification in the Golgi apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2027713980,"The receptor for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is synthesized as a 120 kd precursor that undergoes a 40 kd posttranslational increase in apparent molecular weight en route to the cell surface. We describe seven mutations that disrupt synthesis, processing and transport of the receptor in fibroblasts from 77 subjects with the clinical diagnosis of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. One mutation obliterates synthesis of immunoprecipitable precursor. Three mutations specify precursors (100, 120 and 135 kd) that fail to undergo normal processing and fail to reach the cell surface. The other three mutations specify precursors (100, 120, and 170 kd) that undergo a normal 40 kd increase in molecular weight and reach the surface, but do not bind LDL normally. Pedigree studies show that each mutation segregates as an allele at the LDL receptor locus. These data imply that signals for transport of receptors from endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface are contained within the amino acid sequences of the receptors, and that mutations affecting these sequences can disrupt receptor transport."

https://openalex.org/W1506188765,"Net H+ fluxes across the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (CC139) were monitored by pH-stat titration. Na+-depleted cells release H+ upon addition of Na+. Conversely Na+- or Li+-loaded cells take up H+ from the medium when shifted to a Na+,Li+-free medium. This reversible Na+ (or Li+)-dependent H+ flux is inhibited by amiloride and does not occur in digitonin-permeabilized cells. A similar Na+/H+ exchanger was identified in vascular smooth muscle cells, corneal and aortic endothelial cells, lens epithelial cells of bovine origin, and human platelets. Kinetic studies carried out with CC139 cells indicate the following properties: 1) half-saturation of the system is observed at pH = 7.8, in the absence of Na+; 2) external Na+ stimulates H+ release and inhibits H+ uptake in a competitive manner (Ki = 2-3 mM); 3) amiloride is a competitive inhibitor for Na+ (Ki congruent to 1 microM) and a noncompetitive inhibitor for H+; 4) a coupling ratio of 1.3 +/- 0.3 for the H+/Li+ exchange suggests a stoichiometry of 1:1. We conclude that CC139 cells possess in their plasma membrane a reversible, electroneutral, and amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ antiporter, with two distinct and mutually exclusive binding sites for Na+ and H+. The rapid stimulation of the Na+/H+ antiporter in G0/G1-arrested CC139 cells upon addition of growth factors, together with the fact that intracellular H+ concentration is, under physiological conditions, around the apparent K0.5 of the system, strongly suggests a key role of this antiport in pHi regulation and mitogen action."
https://openalex.org/W2066267034,"The gal operon of Escherichia coli is transcribed from two overlapping promoters, PG1 and PG2. Cyclic AMP and its receptor protein (CRP) modulate the two promoters in opposite directions by binding to a single cat locus. Both the promoters are negatively regulated by a single repressor, the product of the galR gene. An operator site, defined by several mutations, has previously been located upstream from the cat locus. We have isolated and characterized a new set of cis-dominant constitutive mutations of the gal operon and determined their locations by DNA sequencing. From these studies, we propose the existence of a second functional gal operator element at an extraordinary site--within galE, the first structural gene. Both the operators, OE (exterior) and OI (interior), are involved in the repression of PG1 and PG2. This would be the first example of the presence of a functional operator element within a structural protein-coding region."
https://openalex.org/W1486593521,"We have analyzed wild type mouse hepatoma (Hepa 1c1c7) cells and variant cells which are defective in the induction of benzo(a)pyrene-metabolizing enzyme activity. One type of variant has no detectable basal or inducible aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. This class contains apparently normal cytosolic receptors for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, but is unable to translocate the inducer-receptor complex to the nucleus. The second type of variant has low levels of basal and inducible aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. This class contains cytosolic receptors which are decreased either in their number or in their ability to bind 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; translocation of the inducer-receptor complex to the nucleus is apparently normal. Cell fusions indicate that both variant phenotypes are recessive with respect to wild type. Complementation analyses indicate that the defects are located on different genes."
https://openalex.org/W2042099787,"We have shown that the 34 bp internal control region of the somatic 5S RNA gene from Xenopus borealis can be split into two separable components. A maxigene carrying an insertion between nucleotide 71 and nucleotide 74 of the coding region is actively transcribed in the nucleus of X. laevis oocytes, giving rise to a maxitranscript with initiation and termination points identical with those of the wild-type transcript. The first 11 bases of the 5S RNA gene promoter are shown to be structurally and functionally homologous with the first component (box A) of the promoter for tRNA genes. This was shown by constructing hybrid 5S RNA-tRNAPro and tRNAPro-5S RNA genes that were efficiently transcribed in the X. laevis oocytes. Initiation of transcription appears to be a complex phenomenon in which both components of the internal promoter play a role."
https://openalex.org/W2039721221,"The endosymbiotic theory of the origin of mitochondria is widely accepted, and implies that loss of genes from the mitochondria to the nucleus of eukaryotic cells has occurred over evolutionary time. However, evidence at the DNA sequence level for gene transfer between these organelles has so far been limited to a single example, the demonstration that a mitochondrial ATPase subunit gene of Neurospora crassa has an homologous partner in the nuclear genome. From a gene library of the insect, Locusta migratoria, we have now isolated two clones, representing separate fragments of nuclear DNA, which contain sequences homologous to the mitochondrial genes for ribosomal RNA, as well as regions of homology with highly repeated nuclear sequences. The results suggest the transfer of sequences between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, followed by evolutionary divergence."
https://openalex.org/W2049633804,"Several lines of evidence suggest that there might be immunologic cross-reactivity between the thyroid plasma membrane in humans and antigenic determinants in the enteric pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica. Studies were therefore performed to determine whether Y. enterocolitica, like the thyroid membrane, contains a thyrotropin binding site. A saturable binding site for bovine thyrotropin was indeed demonstrable, particularly in preparations of the organism that have been treated with ethylenediaminetetraacetate and lysozyme. Hormonal specificity of the binding site, as judged from the inhibition of binding of 125I-labeled bovine thyrotropin, was similar to that of the thyrotropin receptor in human thyroid tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2122874132,"Transposition of Tn10 requires sites at the termini of the element and one essential transposon-encoded function, ""transposase"", which acts at those termini. Genetic complementation experiments reveal that this ""transposase"" function works much more efficiently on transposon ends located near the gene from which they are expressed than on transposon ends located at a distance. This property accounts for the failure of mutant Tn10 elements to be efficiently complemented in trans. The failure of transposase protein to move freely in three dimensions could be explained by one-dimensional diffusion, energy-dependent translocation and/or extreme protein lability. Additional genetic analyses demonstrate that the rate of Tn10 transposition in vivo depends upon the length of the transposon and the amount of transposase protein. Function dependence and length dependence are independent aspects of the transposition process that could correspond to the break/join and replication aspects into which transposition has been separated conceptually."
https://openalex.org/W1573704697,"Direct electron spin resonance was used to detect tert-alkylperoxyl radicals generated by hematin and the corresponding hydroperoxides at near-physiological pH values. The spin-trapping method was necessary to detect the less persistent primary ethylperoxyl radical. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, the electron spin resonance signal of the tert-alkylperoxyl radicals decreased, and the ethylperoxyl spin-adduct concentration did not change. Concomitant studies, using a Clark oxygen electrode, show that oxygen was consumed by the hematin-tert-alkyl hydroperoxide systems, but was released by the hematin-ethyl hydroperoxide reaction. Thus, molecular oxygen seems to play a subsidiary role in the hematin-catalyzed decomposition of hydroperoxides. Based on the electron spin resonance and oxygen electrode results, a mechanism for the continuous production of the peroxyl free radicals is proposed for hematin/hydroperoxide systems. The present spectroscopic methodology can be used to search for peroxyl free radical formation by hemoprotein/hydroperoxide systems."
https://openalex.org/W1532893533,"Evidence is presented that monoclonal gamma-immunoglobulin secreted by hybridoma-24 recognizes the sodium and potassium ion-stimulated ATPase of neurons, muscle fibers, and kidney tubule cells in the chicken. The antigen consists of alpha (Mr = 105,000) and beta (Mr = 47,000) subunits. Only the beta subunit bears major oligosaccharide additions (including binding sites for wheat germ agglutinin) to its polypeptide core (Mr = 32,000). The detergent-solubilized antigen sediments as a 7 S complex of alpha beta or alpha beta 2. The antigen has a basolateral distribution in the plasma membrane of renal tubule cells, and in myogenic cell cultures there is up-regulation of the antigen in low potassium medium. Monoclonal antibody-24 specifically recognizes purified gull salt gland (Na+ + K+)-ATPase as well as the major candidate molecule for the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in enriched preparations from chicken kidney. On cultured myotubes, the number of ouabain-binding sites (4.8 X 10(5)/nucleus) and antigenic sites (4.4 X 10(5)) are approximately equal. However, the antigenic sites on fibroblasts (1.1 X 10(4)) account for only about 4% of the ouabain-binding sites, and there is little or no antibody binding to capillary endothelial cells, Schwann cells, or erythrocytes. Evidence is presented that the antigenic determinant is proteinaceous. It is concluded that at least two antigenically distinct (Na+ + K+)-ATPases exist in the chicken."
https://openalex.org/W1487686100,"Iodination of [Trp11]neurotensin, a neurotensin analogue in which tyrosine 11 has been substituted by a tryptophan, led to the incorporation of one or two iodine atoms on the single tyrosine residue in position 3. Both mono- and diiodinated derivatives were purified by ion exchange chromatography and their biological activity in an in vitro bioassay involving rat ileum was found to be similar to that of native neurotensin. The 125I-labeled monoiodo derivative of [Trp11]neurotensin bound specifically and reversibly to rat brain synaptic membranes. The binding isotherm was biphasic and could be described by postulating the existence of two different classes of independent binding sites with dissociation constants of 0.1 and 4.7 nM. The specificity of a series of neurotensin analogues for both high and low affinity binding sites was the same as that previously observed in other neurotensin radioreceptor assays. The low affinity binding sites appeared to be similar to the single class of sites described in other binding studies. The high affinity binding sites which were not previously detected might represent either a new class of neurotensin receptors or a high affinity state for a fraction of a single population of neurotensin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2082205791,"The nature of the target cell for Abelson virus transformation and the effect of transformation on B cell differentiation were studied with six cloned lines of nontransformed immature B lymphocytes. Three clones were at the pre-B cell stage of maturation prior to A-MuLV infection; two were at the B cell stage, and one appeared to represent a stage prior to rearrangement of the mu heavy chain gene. All six cloned lines could be transformed by Abelson virus. Many of the transformants of the pre-B cell clones underwent kappa light chain gene rearrangement and expression following viral infection. Distinct light chain gene rearrangements were segregated by further subcloning these transformed lines. Abelson virus infection of one cloned cell line believed to represent a stage of maturation prior to the pre-B cell stage produced pre-B cell transformants with a variety of heavy chain gene rearrangements. Thus B lymphoid target cells for Abelson virus are not restricted to a single developmental stage, and some transformed subclones can undergo extensive immunoglobulin gene rearrangements shortly after viral infection."

https://openalex.org/W1522925775,"The affinity of many types of membrane receptors for agonists is decreased by Na+ in radioligand binding experiments. We studied the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor of human platelets to determine whether Na+ acts at an intracellular or extracellular location. The Na+ content of intact platelets in an isotonic saline buffer was 38 nmol/10(8) platelets. This increased to 138 nmol/10(8) platelets with the Na+-selective ionophore monensin and decreased to 13 nmol/10(8) platelets with incubation in a Na+-free buffer. Epinephrine-induced platelet aggregation was increased by the addition of monensin and was decreased in the Na+-free buffer, while thrombin-induced aggregation was unaltered by either condition. Monensin, gramicidin, and ouabain (which all increased intraplatelet Na+) caused a 2-3-fold increase in the Kd of epinephrine (in competition with [3H]yohimbine) for alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on intact platelets. Conversely, incubation in a Na+-free buffer (which decreased intraplatelet Na+) decreased the Kd of the receptors for epinephrine 2-3-fold. These experiments suggest that changes in intracellular Na+ alter epinephrine binding. Control studies eliminated several alternative explanations for the effect of monensin on epinephrine binding: 1) monensin altered epinephrine binding only with intact platelets and not with platelet membranes; 2) although monensin depolarized platelets (assessed by [3H]methyltriphenylphosphonium uptake), other depolarizing conditions did not change epinephrine binding; 3) although monensin may increase intracellular pH (by exchanging Na+ for H+) such an increase in pH decreased the Kd of alpha 2-receptors on platelet membranes for epinephrine, an effect opposite to that produced by monensin in intact platelets. We conclude that alterations in the intracellular concentration of Na+ may change the affinity of platelet alpha 2-receptors for epinephrine. These results suggest a key role for intracellular Na+ in modulating binding at cell surface receptors in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2022381940,"The terrestrial snail Cepaea nemoralis, when placed on a 40 degrees C hot plate, lifts the anterior portion of its foot. The latency of this response is influenced by morphine and by naloxone in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Morphine increases the time taken to respond, whereas naloxone reduces it. Furthermore, naloxone abolishes the effect of morphine. These results indicate that an opiate system may have a role in this behavior, which resembles that reported in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1526835946,"1. (Na+ + K+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase was phosphorylated on the alpha-subunit by Pi in the presence of Mg2+. Phosphorylation was stimulated by ouabain. The interactions of Pi, Mg2+, and ouabain with the enzyme could be explained by a random terreactant scheme in which the binding of each ligand to the enzyme increased the affinities for the other two. Dissociation constants of all steps of this scheme were estimated. 2. In the presence of Pi and ouabain and without added Mg2+, the phosphoenzyme was formed. Because this could be prevented by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, but not ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, phosphoenzyme formation under these conditions was probably dependent on traces of endogenous Mg2+. The ability of this Mg2+ to support phosphorylation could be explained by the large increase in the enzyme's affinity for Mg2+ by ouabain. 3. In the absence of ouabain, Ca2+ did not support phosphorylation and inhibited Mg2+-dependent phosphorylation. At lower concentrations, Ca2+ was competitive with Mg2+. With increasing Ca2+ concentration, negative cooperativity was observed, suggesting the existence of multiple divalent cation sites with equivalent affinities for Mg2+, but varying affinities for Ca2+. 4. In the presence of ouabain, the maximum inhibition of Mg2+-dependent phosphorylation by Ca2+ was 50%. With saturating Pi, Mg2+, and ouabain, the number of sites binding ouabain was equal to the number of sites phosphorylated. Although Ca2+ halved phosphorylation and reduced the affinity for ouabain about 100-fold, it did not affect the number of ouabain sites. 5. We suggest that the enzyme is an alpha-oligomer and that the half-of-the-sites reactivity for phosphorylation in the presence of Pi, Mg2+, ouabain, and optimal Ca2+ is caused by (a) ouabain-induced increase in the affinities of both protomers for Mg2+ and (b) the inability of Ca2+ to replace Mg2+ on one of the protomers."
https://openalex.org/W1559081557,"Adenylate cyclase of Escherichia coli K12 has been purified 17,000-fold to near homogeneity from a 5-fold overproducing strain. One major band of Mr = 92,000 and several minor bands are seen on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of the purest fractions. Identification of the enzyme with the 92,000-Da protein is based on the correlation of this band with activity when highly purified enzyme is eluted from ADP-sepharose columns. The native enzyme has a molecular weight of 95,000 determined by gel filtration, showing that the enzyme is active as a monomer. The purest enzyme has a specific activity of 700 nmol min-1 mg-1, indicating a turnover number of about 100 min-1. Our data indicate that there are only about 15 molecules of the enzyme in wild type cells of E. coli. In crude extracts, over 80% of the activity is soluble after centrifugation at 100,000 x g, indicating the enzyme is soluble or, at most, loosely membrane bound. The enzyme is only moderately stable in crude extracts and becomes more unstable as purification proceeds. Activity is stabilized by ATP, or at -20 degrees C as an ammonium sulfate precipitate or in 50% glycerol. The enzyme has an absolute requirement for divalent cations. Maximum activity with Mg2+ is reached at 30 mM. Mn2+ is a good substitute; Co2+ activates well at low concentrations but becomes inhibitory at high concentrations; and Ca2+ is a potent inhibitor in the presence of Mg2+. The isoelectric point of the enzyme is 6.1, and its pH optimum is 8.5. The enzyme is inhibited by its substrate, with a Km of about 1 mM and a Ki of about 1.5 mM, and is noncompetitively inhibited by PPi, ADP, GTP, and a number of other compounds. The data suggest that dissociation of PPi from the first enzyme-product complex is the rate-limiting step in the reaction. Activation of the enzyme, inferred to occur in vivo, could be produced by a postulated regulatory effector which speeds release of PPi from the enzyme-product complex."
https://openalex.org/W1966828860,"Forskolin, a highly specific activator of adenylate cyclase, produced both delay and advance phase shifts of the circadian rhythm recorded from the isolated eye of the marine mollusk Aplysia. The phase dependence of the response to forskolin was identical to that with serotonin, which also stimulates adenylate cyclase in the eye. The ability of agents to activate adenylate cyclase in homogenates was correlated with their ability to shift the phase of the circadian oscillator. These results along with earlier findings show that adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate mediates the effect of serotonin on the rhythm and regulates the phase of the circadian pacemaker in the eye of Aplysia."

https://openalex.org/W1601131398,"Actin has been identified and purified partially from trophozoites of Entamoeba histolytica HMI-IMSS by a procedure that minimizes proteolysis. In cellular extracts, Entamoeba actin would copolymerize with muscle actin, but would not bind to DNase I or form microfilaments. Fractionation of the extracts by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-150 chromatography yielded a purified actin that would copolymerize with rabbit skeletal muscle actin or polymerize alone into long filaments at 24 degrees C upon addition of 100 mM KC1 and 2 mM MgCl2. These filaments are not cold-stable and will depolymerize at 4 degrees C in 1 or 2 h. Entamoeba actin filaments bind phallotoxin with the same affinity as muscle actin and decorate with rabbit skeletal muscle heavy meromyosin. Entamoeba actin filaments activate the Mg2+ ATPase of heavy meromyosin to the same Vmax as muscle actin, but the Kapp is 2.8 times higher. Entamoeba actin is a single species with a slightly higher molecular weight than muscle actin (45,000) and a more acidic pI (5.4). The purified actin does not bind to DNase I, produce inhibition of the enzymatic activity, or block the binding of muscle actin. Comparison of the peptides obtained by limit digest with protease V8 from Staphylococcus aureus shows sequences with common mobility between alpha-actin and Entamoeba actin, but additional peptides are present which may account for the different properties of the Entamoeba actin. Finally, in vitro translation of mRNA from trophozoites produces a single polypeptide equivalent to the molecule purified from Entamoeba extracts."

https://openalex.org/W2006409287,"We have analyzed two mutations in src responsible for phenotypic reversion and subsequent retransformation of a Rous sarcoma virus-transformed rat cell. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of cloned proviral DNAs reveals a single base pair insertion approximately 438 bp from the 5′ end of src in the revertant line 000. This frameshift mutation accounts for an 18 kd protein as the prematurely terminated product of src. The mutation is suppressed in the retransformed line (000∗) by a 242 bp duplication that corrects the reading frame to permit synthesis of a 68 kd src protein. A 43 kd src protein with a normal carboxyl terminus is also present in 000 and 000∗ cells. To make this protein, translation must begin at an internal AUG, found just upstream from the frameshift mutation; in both lines, two src proteins appear to be initiated independently from the same mRNA species. Our results imply that a protein of 7 kd is synthesized from a second reading frame within wild-type src."
https://openalex.org/W1963927136,"Influenza A viruses (subtype H1N1), recently isolated from turkeys in different areas of the United States, were determined to be closely related to strains typically associated with pigs. This conclusion was based on comparisons of H1N1 isolates from pigs, humans, ducks, and turkeys with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, RNA-RNA competitive hybridization, and replication studies. One of the H1N1 isolates from turkeys caused influenza in a laboratory technician, who displayed fever, respiratory illness, virus shedding, and seroconversion. These results suggest that turkeys as well as pigs are involved in the maintenance of these viruses and their transmission to humans."
https://openalex.org/W2042300235,"The colony-forming response of SV40 transformed BALB/c-3T3 cells in agarose suspension culture was studied in a serum-free medium (with insulin, transferrin and serum albumin as the only macromolecular supplements) that was optimized for colony formation of fibronectin-attached monolayer cultures. In this serum-free medium, the SV3T3 cells fail to form colonies in agarose suspension. However, they can be induced to anchorage-independent colony formation by the growth factors that are additionally required by their untransformed counterparts for proliferation in monolayer culture. The SV3T3 cells are also rendered anchorage-independent for colony formation in serum-free medium by conditioned medium from dense monolayer serumfree SV3T3 cultures. These experiments suggest that it is the cell-substrate interaction that is responsible for the growth factor autonomy of fibronectin-attached transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W1606676886,"The refolding of guanidine hydrochloride-denatured horse heart ferricytochrome c at pH 7.0 and 23 degrees C occurs in three kinetic phases as observed by stopped flow measurements using changes in Soret absorbance or in tryptophan fluorescence. The three kinetic phases have time constants of 10 +/- 5 ms, 240 +/- 30 ms, and 13 +/- 3 s accounting for 15 +/- 5%, 70 +/- 5%, and 15 +/- 5% of the total reaction, respectively. The intermediate kinetic phase can be selectively eliminated by conducting the refolding measurements at pH 5.0. Both the intermediate and slow kinetic phases can be eliminated by conducting the refolding measurements either at pH 7.0 or at pH 5.0 in the presence of an excess of an extrinsic ligand for an axial position of the heme iron. Similar results are obtained using tuna heart ferricytochrome c except that the fractional reaction in the fast and intermediate kinetic phases at pH 7.0 in the absence of extrinsic ligand are 29 +/- 2% and 58 +/- 2%, respectively. We suggest that both the intermediate and slow kinetic phases are generated by proline peptide isomerization occurring during and prior to the refolding procedure, respectively, and that their occurrence is dependent upon the conformation of the denatured protein and upon the ligation of methionine 80 in the folded product, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1525792378,"The binding of 125I-labeled nerve growth factor (NGF) to human melanoma cell (A875) membranes, detergent-soluble membrane extracts, and membrane extracts reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles was significantly increased when binding was carried out in the presence of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). In the absence of WGA, all 125I-NGF binding was rapidly eliminated by trypsin treatment or rapidly dissociated in the presence of a high concentration of unlabeled NGF. However, in the presence of WGA, up to 75% of 125I-NGF bound was resistant to trypsin digestion and was only slowly dissociated by a high concentration of unlabeled NGF. The effects of WGA can be blocked or reversed by N-acetylglucosamine. Both WGA and NGF rapidly associate with soluble extracts and reconstituted vesicles and, at the concentrations used here, reach binding equilibrium within 2 min. The conversion to slowly dissociating, trypsin-resistant binding, however, was not complete for at least 10 min. Both WGA and NGF are required for maximum accumulation of trypsin-resistant, slowly dissociating binding. The order of addition of NGF and WGA has no effect on the rate of conversion of NGF-receptor, and the conversion occurs after both NGF and WGA are present. The amount of conversion is dependent on the incubation temperature, and significantly greater conversion occurs at 37 than at 0 degrees C. The generation of the trypsin-resistant, slowly dissociating state of NGF-receptor is consistent with a time- and temperature-dependent conformational change in NGF-receptor which occurs after interaction of both NGF and WGA with the receptor or closely associated structures."
https://openalex.org/W2030837876,"Primary cultures of epithelial cells were grown from the tonsils and adenoids of patients with diseases not related to Epstein-Barr virus. The cells could not be infected by Epstein-Barr virus. Fluorescein-labeled Epstein-Barr virus and a cytofluorograph were then used to show that the epithelial cells do not have detectable receptors for the virus. However, implantation with Epstein-Barr virus receptors gave the cells the ability to bind the labeled virus. One to 5 percent of receptor-implanted cells exposed to the transforming B95-8 substrain of the virus expressed Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen. The early and viral capsid Epstein-Barr virus-determined antigens were not detected in the virus-infected cultures. The results show that normal human epithelial cells from the nasopharynx become susceptible to infection by Epstein-Barr virus when the membrane barrier resulting from the lack of viral receptors is overcome by receptor implantation."
https://openalex.org/W1996930587,"Long-term exposure of sexually mature female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulata) to thrice weekly injections of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol resulted in a disruption of menstrual cycles that lasted for several months. This period was marked by an absence of ovulation and decreased basal concentrations of gonadotropin and sex steroids in the plasma. After this period, normal cycles and hormone concentrations were reestablished. These studies demonstrate that in rhesus monkeys subjected to long-term treatment with Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol tolerance develops to the disruptive effects of the drug on the menstrual cycle."

An increased junctional conductance and bidirectional transmission are produced, with almost no delay, by inverting this polarization."

https://openalex.org/W1678621450,"The two processing sites in the conversion of preproalbumin to albumin are marked by arginine residues. Therefore, to study the mechanisms of albumin processing and secretion, the arginine residues of nascent albumin were replaced with canavanine by the incubation of Hep-G2 cells with this arginine analog. During a 4-h interval, canavanine inhibited (67%) the secretion of nascent albumin and increased the intracellular transit time of albumin secretion from 24 to 39 min. At 1 h, canavanine inhibited total protein synthesis by 19% and albumin synthesis by about 40%. Both the intracellular and secreted albumin produced by canavanine-treated cells were analyzed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and were found to be more acidic than normal proalbumin and albumin. Further analysis on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that the albumin produced and secreted by canavanine-treated cells appeared to have a larger molecular weight (by 4000) than serum albumin. The canavanine-treated cells were incubated with L-[3H]leucine and L-[3H]phenylalanine and the location of radioactive L-leucine and L-phenylalanine in the 30 NH2-terminal amino acid residues of secreted albumin was determined. The results indicated that canavanine-treated cells secreted proalbumin (79%) and also some fully processed albumin (21%). Preproalbumin was not secreted. Untreated Hep-G2 cells mostly secreted fully processed serum albumin (93%) with only traces of proalbumin (7%)."
https://openalex.org/W1602609226,"The Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen (EBNA) is speculated to be involved in cell transformation by the virus. Studies on the molecular properties of EBNA, however, have yielded conflicting results. In this study, three Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-induced antigens were isolated and purified from extracts prepared from Raji cells. These antigens were able to block the anticomplement immunofluorescence reaction, indicating that all three were related to EBNA. The soluble antigen was found wholly in the cytosol fraction. An EBV-induced nuclear antigen I was found both in the cytosol and the nucleus. The EBV-induced nuclear antigen II was found associated with the chromatin. The soluble antigen and the nuclear antigen I were separated and partially purified using phosphocellulose chromatography. Each was further purified 1,400-fold with respect to the whole cell state by chromatography on CL-Sepharose 6B followed by blue dextran-Sepharose. subunit molecular weights of 70,000 were determined for each of these antigens, both in the crude and purified state, by radioimmunoelectrophoresis and gel filtration. The nuclear antigen II was purified 2,500-fold using hydroxylapatite, CL-Sepharose 6B, and blue dextran-Sepharose chromatographies. This antigen displayed two subunits by radioimmunoelectrophoresis with molecular weights of 65,000 and 70,000. Although all antigens shared similar molecular weights, the extent of their homology remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1507539106,"Exposure of aqueous solutions of native human choriogonadotropin (hCG), asialo-hCG (A-hCG), and chemically deglycosylated hCG (DG-hCG) to heat treatment revealed significant differences in their stability. Solutions of hCG and A-hCG were rapidly inactivated above 50 degrees C. On the other hand, solutions of DG-hCG were comparatively more stable under similar conditions as shown by the retention of significant receptor binding, immunological, and hormonal antagonistic activities. Heated solutions (100 degrees C) of hCG and A-hCG quickly lost their ability to enhance the fluorescence of the probe 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (1,8-ANS) indicating dissociation into subunits. DG-hCG solutions were more stable in this respect suggesting significant preservation of conformational features required for the interaction with 1,8-ANS. Solutions of hCG and A-hCG which had been thermally denatured (100 degrees C, 10 min) required almost 48 h at 37 degrees C to regain complete ANS binding ability as well as receptor binding activity. Under the same conditions, heated solutions of DG-hCG completely regained these abilities in less than 2 h. A similar pattern was observed with acid (pH 2.0)-dissociated hCG, A-hCG, and DG-hCG. While heated solutions of hCG had no effect on the action of native hCG in vitro, heated DG-hCG solutions still retained their ability to antagonize the cyclic AMP accumulation or steroidogenesis induced by native hCG in rat interstitial cells. Thus, removal of carbohydrate residues (approximately 75% loss) from hCG renders the hormone more resistant to thermal denaturation."
https://openalex.org/W1519773476,"The overall goal of our research is to elucidate the cellular mechanisms involved in the process of luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated down-regulation of the LH receptor. Towards this end, we became interested in determining whether cultured granulosa cells could be used as a physiologic model system to study this important process. In this report, we show that a very brief exposure (2 min) to physiologic concentrations of LH causes down-regulation of the LH receptor in granulosa cells cultured in serum-free medium. These data represent the first in vitro demonstration of down-regulation of the LH receptor in the granulosa cell. Furthermore, the dose dependency and kinetics of down-regulation of the LH receptor in vitro, as described here, are very similar to those reported for LH receptor down-regulation in vivo. Thus, this granulosa cell culture system is a powerful new model for studying the biochemical events involved in LH receptor down-regulation."

https://openalex.org/W1513464462,"In Escherichia coli cya mutants, deficient in adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1), basal cellular rates of glycogen synthesis were lower and the relative increases produced by exogenous cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate during growth on glucose were greater than in their respective parent strains. These observations provide strong evidence that endogenous cyclic AMP is one of the key regulators of glycogen synthesis in growing E. coli. In crp mutants, deficient in cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP), the basal cellular rates of glycogen synthesis were much lower than in their respective parent strains. Stimulation of glycogen synthesis by exogenous cyclic AMP was markedly attenuated in the three crp mutants. Thus, stimulation of glycogen synthesis by either endogenous or exogenous cyclic AMP appears to require CRP. Functional CRP appeared to be required for all three responses observed after cyclic AMP addition: an abrupt step-up in the cellular rate of glycogen synthesis, a continuing exponential increase in rate, and a stimulation of the rate during a subsequent nitrogen starvation. To account for these responses, we derived a mathematical model in which the cyclic AMP-CRP complex regulates the differential rate of synthesis of an enzyme metabolizing an effector of the rate-limiting enzyme of glycogen synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1547567625,"The replicative DNA polymerase alpha is an intracellular target of aphidicolin. In vitro this drug inhibits DNA polymerase alpha reversibly. Yet, its in vivo effect on SV40 DNA replication, which depends on DNA polymerase alpha, was found to be irreversible. Thus, exposure of infected cells to aphidicolin led to a progressive loss in their ability to incorporate [3H]dT into viral DNA in a subsequent pulse without drug. This loss was time-dependent (t1/2 at 37 degrees C at 2 microgram/ml of drug was approximately 20 min) and increased with drug concentration. Likewise, replicating SV40 DNA, pulse-labeled prior to exposure, lost the ability to mature into form I DNA upon removal of the drug. No degradation of replicating SV40 DNA molecules was detected by neutral sucrose gradient analysis during or up to 1 h after aphidicolin exposure. However, longer incubations resulted in breakdown of the arrested replicative intermediate, concomitant with the resumption of viral DNA synthesis. Origin-synchronized SV40 replicons were less affected by exposure to aphidicolin than were ongoing replicons, as judged from comparing recoveries of tsA replicons from 40 degrees C restriction, with or without the drug. The data indicate that replicating SV40 chromosomes become selectively impaired during aphidicolin arrest and prevent thereby the initiation of new replication rounds, perhaps by occupying fixed nuclear replication sites."
https://openalex.org/W1601819909,"A new method for mapping RNA initiation, termination, and splice sites was developed. The method involves: 1) hybridization of RNA to end-labeled single-stranded DNA; 2) mild digestion of the hybrid with a single strand specific nuclease; 3) high resolution gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The regions of the labeled probe which are resistant to nuclease digestion are mapped by measuring the distance from the labeled end. The sequence can be determined by running the end-labeled probe sequenced according to the protocol of Maxam and Gilbert (Maxam, A.M., and Gilbert, W. (1980) Methods Enzymol. 65, 499-560) at the same time. The feasibility of this method was tested with adult chicken beta-globin mRNA, and we found that the transcription initiation, termination, and RNA splice sites can be determined to within a few bases of the known sites. Using this method we also found that ribosomes bind to beta-globin mRNA from 22 bases upstream from the translation start codon (AUG) to 15 bases past the stop codon (UAA)."
https://openalex.org/W1952897809,"A noncovalently bound, ordered complex consisting of fragments (1-25)H and (14-103) derived from tuna cytochrome c has been prepared and characterized. The equilibrium properties of this complex are indistinguishable from those of the corresponding complex, (1-25)H X (23-104), of horse cytochrome c. The tuna species possesses a second tryptophan residue (at position 33 of the amino acid sequence and replacing the histidine residue of the horse protein) whose fluorescence is also essentially fully quenched in the native form and in the complex. It is found that for the tuna complex, the fluorescence of both tryptophans is fully quenched during the second order phase of the reaction mechanism. This provides evidence for the compact nature of the intermediate complexes formed at this stage of the complementation process (Parr, G. R., and Taniuchi, H. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10103-10111). The observed second order rate constant for the tuna fragments is reduced by a factor of two from that for the horse fragments. During the first order kinetic phase corresponding to the transition from the intermediate complexes to the native complex, qualitative as well as quantitative differences are also observed between the tuna and the horse species. The kinetics of complementation of the hybrid complexes is also reported. This exchangeability of both the heme fragment and the apofragment of the complex between these two species indicates close similarity of the folding mechanism. Nonetheless, the results also serve to highlight the subtle effects exerted on the folding process by a relatively small number of changes (17%) in the amino acid sequence."
