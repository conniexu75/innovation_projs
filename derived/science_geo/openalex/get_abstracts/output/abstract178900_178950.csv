By using different substrates and inhibitors, we determined the sites of production (which complexes in the electron transport chain produced superoxide). By measuring hydrogen peroxide production in the absence and presence of exogenous superoxide dismutase, we established the topology of superoxide production (on which side of the mitochondrial inner membrane superoxide was produced). Mitochondria did not release measurable amounts of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide when respiring on complex I or complex II substrates. Mitochondria from skeletal muscle or heart generated significant amounts of superoxide from complex I when respiring on palmitoyl carnitine. They produced superoxide at considerable rates in the presence of various inhibitors of the electron transport chain. Complex I (and perhaps the fatty acid oxidation electron transfer flavoprotein and its oxidoreductase) released superoxide on the matrix side of the inner membrane, whereas center o of complex III released superoxide on the cytoplasmic side. These results do not support the idea that mitochondria produce considerable amounts of reactive oxygen species under physiological conditions. Our upper estimate of the proportion of electron flow giving rise to hydrogen peroxide with palmitoyl carnitine as substrate (0.15%) is more than an order of magnitude lower than commonly cited values. We observed no difference in the rate of hydrogen peroxide production between rat and pigeon heart mitochondria respiring on complex I substrates. However, when complex I was fully reduced using rotenone, rat mitochondria released significantly more hydrogen peroxide than pigeon mitochondria. This difference was solely due to an elevated concentration of complex I in rat compared with pigeon heart mitochondria.

This difference was solely due to an elevated concentration of complex I in rat compared with pigeon heart mitochondria. The free radical theory of aging states that it is the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; MLSP, maximum lifespan; ETF, electron transfer flavoprotein; QOR, quinone oxidoreductase; UCPs, uncoupling proteins; SOD, superoxide dismutase; BSA, bovine serum albumin. such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, and the resulting accumulation of damage to macromolecules that causes aging and determines maximum lifespan (MLSP) (1Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 2: 298-300Google Scholar, 2Harman D. J. Am. Geriatr. Soc. 1972; 20: 145-147Google Scholar). Comparative approaches have shed considerable light on the relationship between ROS and MLSP. Notably, the rate of superoxide production by submitochondrial particles (3Sohal R.S. Svensson I. Sohal B.H. Brunk U.T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1989; 49: 129-135Google Scholar) and the rate of H2O2 production by mitochondria (4Sohal R.S. Svensson I. Brunk U.T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1990; 53: 209-215Google Scholar) are inversely related to MLSP in different species. A complicating factor is the association of longer MLSP with lower metabolic rates within mammals or other groups, but this complication has been resolved by the observation that birds tend to have longer MLSP than mammals with the same metabolic rate. Thus pigeons (long MLSP) have a lower rate of mitochondrial H2O2 production than rats (shorter MLSP), even though these two species have similar standard metabolic rates (5Ku H.H. Sohal R.S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 72: 67-76Google Scholar, 6Barja G. Cadenas S. Rojas C. Perez-Campo R. Lopez-Torres M. Free Radic. Res. 1994; 21: 317-327Google Scholar, 7Herrero A. Barja G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 98: 95-111Google Scholar, 8Herrero A. Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 241-249Google Scholar). Similarly, canaries and parakeets (budgerigars) (long MLSP) have lower rates of mitochondrial H2O2 production than mice (shorter MLSP), although all three species have similar standard metabolic rates (9Herrero A. Barja G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1998; 103: 133-146Google Scholar). Despite numerous studies reporting that mitochondria release H2O2, there is some controversy as to whether mitochondria are an important source of ROS under physiological and pathological conditions (10Forman H.J. Azzi A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 374-375Google Scholar). In agreement with these concerns, Staniek and Nohl (12Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 268-275Google Scholar) reported that mitochondria respiring on complex I and complex II substrates do not generate H2O2 except in the presence of the complex III inhibitor antimycin A. They proposed that unspecific interactions between the commonly used methods of H2O2detection and mitochondria cause artificial rates of H2O2 production (11Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 70-80Google Scholar, 12Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 268-275Google Scholar). Two principal sites of superoxide generation have been identified in mitochondria: complex I and complex III. The relative importance of these two sites seems to vary with experimental conditions and between tissues and species (13Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 347-366Google Scholar). There is no clear consensus in the literature about which side of the mitochondrial inner membrane superoxide is generated by complex I and complex III. In the traditional view, complex III generates superoxide on the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane (14Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Google Scholar). The semiquinone at centero of complex III of heart mitochondria was shown to be the main producer of superoxide based on inhibitor studies (15Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Google Scholar). However, the x-ray structure of complex III reveals that center o is oriented toward the intermembrane space (16Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Google Scholar, 17Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeister V.M. Chi Y.I. Kim K.K. Hung L.W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Google Scholar), suggesting that superoxide production by complex III is directed toward the cytoplasm and not toward the matrix. In support of this view, a recent study has reported that antimycin A-supplemented mitoplasts (mitochondria devoid of portions of outer membrane and cytochrome c) can release superoxide (18Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Google Scholar). In complex I, either the iron-sulfur centers (7Herrero A. Barja G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 98: 95-111Google Scholar, 19Genova M.L. Ventura B. Giuliano G. Bovina C. Formiggini G. Parenti Castelli G. Lenaz G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 364-368Google Scholar) or the active site flavin (20Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Google Scholar) are thought to be mainly responsible for superoxide production. There is no x-ray crystal structure of complex I, but all of these centers are likely to face the matrix side of the membrane. 30 years ago, it was shown that the oxidation of palmitoyl carnitine by mitochondria leads to the generation of H2O2(21Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; : 617-630Google Scholar, 22Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Google Scholar). These results received little attention and, to our knowledge, no study has examined how lipid metabolism could cause ROS generation in mammalian mitochondria. The oxidation of fatty acids involves the electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and the electron transfer flavoprotein quinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QOR) that could act as potential sources of ROS production. The role of lipid metabolism in the generation of ROS by mitochondria gained our attention recently when it was shown that the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs) correlates with the use of lipid as fuel substrates (23Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. Faseb J. 1998; 12: 715-724Google Scholar, 24Cadenas S. Buckingham J.A. Samec S. Seydoux J. Din N. Dulloo A.G. Brand M.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 257-260Google Scholar) and that UCPs are activated by superoxide (25Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Google Scholar). An interesting hypothesis is that the elevated expression of UCPs during increased reliance on lipid metabolism is a part of a mechanism to protect against high levels of ROS production during the oxidation of fatty acids. In light of the controversy regarding the production of H2O2 by mitochondria and its relevance to aging, additional studies to characterize the generation of ROS by mitochondria are required. The aims of the present study were 1) to quantify the production of ROS by intact mitochondria from different tissues, 2) to identify the electron transport sites involved in ROS generation, 3) to determine the topology of ROS production, on which side of the inner membrane ROS are produced, and 4) to re-examine differences in the production of ROS by heart mitochondria from rat and pigeon, species with similar standard metabolic rate but markedly different MLSP. The horseradish peroxidase, homovanillic acid, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and hydrogen peroxide solution, were purchased from Sigma. The substrates (malate, pyruvate, succinate, carnitine, and palmitoyl carnitine), inhibitors (rotenone, antimycin A, myxothiazol, and oligomycin), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were also obtained from Sigma. Female Wistar rats aged between 5 and 8 weeks were used. Pigeons were provided by Abbott Brothers, Norfolk, UK. Skeletal muscle, heart, and liver mitochondria were isolated as described (26Rolfe D.F. Hulbert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 405-416Google Scholar), resuspended in standard assay medium containing 120 mm KCl, 5 mmKH2PO4, 3 mm Hepes, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.3% BSA (pH 7.2 at 20 °C) and kept on ice. Mitochondria were of good quality (at least 3-fold increase in respiration rate in the presence of an uncoupler). Protein content was determined using the Biuret method (27Gornall A.G. Bardawill C.J. David M.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1949; 177: 751-766Google Scholar) with BSA as standard. The rate of mitochondrial production of H2O2 was determined by following its reaction with homovanillic acid in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (28Barja G. Yu B.P. Methods in Aging Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 533-548Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu RF5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer. Rat and pigeon mitochondria were incubated at 0.4 mg/ml at 37 °C and 41 °C, respectively, in standard assay medium. The following reactants were incorporated to the standard assay medium at the final concentrations indicated in parentheses. First, horseradish peroxidase (12 units/ml; one unit forms 18 μm per min of purpurogallin from pyrogallol at 25 °C) and homovanillic acid (0.1 mm) were added and a 3-min incubation period was allowed for temperature equilibration. Oligomycin (1 μg/mg mitochondrial protein), an inhibitor of the F1Fo-ATP synthase, was added to prevent ATP synthesis. Production of H2O2 was started by adding substrate: malate (1 mm) and pyruvate (2.5 mm) for complex I; succinate (5 mm), in the presence of rotenone (10 μm), for complex II or palmitoyl carnitine (60 μm), in the presence of l-carnitine (2 mm), as a lipid-derived substrate. Oxidation of palmitoyl carnitine generates equal amounts of NADH2, which enters the electron transport chain at complex I, and FADH2, which enters via the ETF and ETF-QOR. Calibration curves were obtained by adding known amounts of H2O2 to assay medium in the presence of the reactants (homovanillic acid and horseradish peroxidase). They were performed in the absence and presence of mitochondria to establish whether any mitochondrial components interfered with the assay. Standard curves were linear up to 6 μm H2O2 (Fig.1). Mitochondria quenched the fluorescence: the slopes of the standard curves obtained in the presence of liver, skeletal muscle, and heart mitochondria were 66, 81 and 86%, respectively, of the slope of the control curve without mitochondria (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 illustrates the effects of various corrections that we applied to the rates of H2O2 production using skeletal muscle as an example. Horseradish peroxidase and SOD were in excess in the experiments since doubling the final concentration of these enzymes did not affect the results (data not shown). Rates of mitochondrial H2O2 production were higher if calculated using the standard curve with mitochondria than using the control standard curve (Fig. 2; compare the black and white bars). There were significant rates of apparent H2O2production in the absence of mitochondria (calibrated using the control standard curve). SOD, added at 50 units/ml (one unit inhibits the rate of reduction of cytochrome c by 50% in a coupled system with xanthine and xanthine oxidase at pH 7.8 at 25 °C in a 3-ml reaction volume), caused significant interference to the detection method, increasing the fluorescence signal under all conditions (Fig.2, gray bars, and Fig. 3). The final rates of H2O2 production (fully corrected signals; dotted bars in Fig. 2) were obtained by subtracting the rates measured in the absence of mitochondria (calibrated without mitochondria: gray bars) from the rates measured in the presence of mitochondria (calibrated with mitochondria; white bars). All the following results represent fully corrected rates of H2O2 production.Figure 3Fluorometric traces of H2O2 production in the presence of malate and pyruvate (MP), oligomycin (O), and SOD. The figure shows typical traces obtained in the absence and presence of mitochondria illustrating the interference of SOD with the detection method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Various inhibitors of electron transport were used to define more precisely the sites of ROS production (28Barja G. Yu B.P. Methods in Aging Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 533-548Google Scholar). Rotenone inhibits complex I, while myxothiazol (used at 0.625 nmol/mg protein) and antimycin A (used at 0.625 nmol/mg protein) inhibit centero and center i of complex III respectively. To determine which side of the mitochondrial inner membrane superoxide (O 2⨪) was generated, we measured the rate of H2O2 production in the presence and absence of exogenous SOD. If mitochondria produce O 2⨪ on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane, addition of exogenous SOD will increase the natural dismutation rate of O 2⨪ (and that catalyzed by any contaminating or endogenous SOD) and compete with other side reactions, leading to an elevated rate of H2O2 production. If mitochondria generate O 2⨪ on the matrix side of the inner membrane, much of it will be converted to H2O2by the matrix SOD. H2O2 will diffuse out, and there will be no difference in the rates of extramitochondrial H2O2 appearance in the presence and absence of exogenous SOD. Complex I concentration was measured as described by Burch (29Burch H. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 960-963Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were performed using Sigma Stat 2.0. The H2O2 production rate of mitochondria from a given tissue with a given substrate was compared between different experimental conditions using one-way analysis of variance and the a posteriori Tukey test. Comparisons between rat and pigeon heart mitochondria were carried out using a paired t test. The level of significance wasp = 0.05. The rate of H2O2 production by skeletal muscle or heart mitochondria incubated with malate and pyruvate was very low and was not increased by addition of SOD (Figs.4 A and 5 A). However, the addition of rotenone to mitochondria respiring on malate and pyruvate induced a significant rate of H2O2generation (Figs. 4 A and5 A). This rotenone-stimulated H2O2 production came primarily from the matrix side of the inner membrane since the signal was insensitive to addition of exogenous SOD (Figs. 4 A and 5 A). These results indicate that complex I in skeletal muscle and heart mitochondria can generate superoxide on the matrix side of the inner membrane when it is fully reduced and inhibited by rotenone but that the rate measured when the complex is not inhibited by rotenone is extremely low.Figure 5Rates of H2O2production by rat heart mitochondria. Values are means ± S.E. A, malate plus pyruvate as substrates;n = 5–7. B, succinate (plus rotenone) as substrate; n = 5. C, palmitoyl carnitine (plus carnitine) as substrate; n = 4. Statistical significance (as in Fig. 4) is indicated by different letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There was no detectable rate of H2O2 production when skeletal muscle or heart mitochondria were fed succinate (in the presence of rotenone) in the absence or presence of SOD (Figs.4 B and 5 B). There was little or no rate of H2O2 production in the presence of myxothiazol in the absence or presence of SOD (Figs. 4 B and5 B), showing that neither complex II nor the ubiquinone pool can produce significant amounts of O 2⨪ on either side of the membrane when they are extensively reduced. Addition of antimycin A led to a low but measurable rate of H2O2 production (Figs. 4 B and5 B) that was significantly increased by addition of exogenous SOD (Figs. 4 B and 5 B). These results indicate that center o of complex III can generate O 2⨪ on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane of skeletal muscle or heart mitochondria when it is reduced following inhibition of the complex at center i by antimycin A but that the rate measured when the complex is not inhibited by antimycin A is extremely low. There was some H2O2 production in the presence of antimycin A even without exogenous SOD, which might suggest that center o can also produce O 2⨪ on the matrix side of the inner membrane. However, even if mitochondria only produce O 2⨪ on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, there will be a detectable rate of H2O2 production without exogenous SOD because of contaminating or endogenous SOD and the natural dismutation of O 2⨪ into H2O2. In other words, if a rate of H2O2 production has a SOD-sensitive and a SOD-insensitive part, we can state that the SOD-sensitive part emanates from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane but we cannot be certain whether the SOD-insensitive part represents the natural dismutation rate of O 2⨪ coming from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane or H2O2 coming from the matrix side of the membrane. Skeletal muscle or heart mitochondria respiring on palmitoyl carnitine had a significant rate of H2O2 production that was not significantly increased by addition of SOD (Figs. 4 Cand 5 C). This result indicates that oxidation of palmitoyl carnitine (unlike oxidation of malate and pyruvate or succinate plus rotenone) leads to significant ROS production and that this ROS is produced mostly on the matrix side of the inner membrane. The addition of rotenone led to a slight increase in the rate of H2O2 production that did not reach statistical significance and was SOD-insensitive (Figs. 4 C and5 C). The rates of H2O2 production in the presence of palmitoyl carnitine and rotenone were very similar to those in the presence of malate, pyruvate, and rotenone (Figs.4 A and 5 A), suggesting that complex I was the source of this ROS with either substrate when complex I was fully reduced in the presence of rotenone. In the absence of rotenone, perhaps complex I is more reduced with palmitoyl carnitine as substrate (due to reversed electron transport and competition with ETF-QOR for oxidized Q) than it is with malate and pyruvate, leading to greater endogenous ROS production from complex I with palmitoyl carnitine. In the presence of palmitoyl carnitine, the addition of myxothiazol led to an increase in the rate of H2O2 production that did not reach statistical significance in skeletal muscle mitochondria and was SOD-insensitive (Figs. 4 C and5 C). Under these conditions complex I, complex II, ETF-QOR, and the ubiquinone pool may all be strongly reduced. H2O2 production with palmitoyl carnitine plus myxothiazol was slightly (but not significantly) greater than with palmitoyl carnitine plus rotenone (Figs. 4 C and5 C); if this effect was real, it may be that ETF-QOR and ETF can also produce some O 2⨪ on the matrix side of the membrane. Complex II and the ubiquinone pool would not be the source of such O 2⨪ because there was no H2O2production in the presence of succinate and myxothiazol (Figs.4 B and 5 B). Addition of antimycin A to skeletal muscle or heart mitochondria supplemented with palmitoyl carnitine greatly increased the rate of H2O2 production (Figs. 4 C and5 C). This rate was increased by addition of SOD (in skeletal muscle mitochondria), showing that much of it was due to production of O 2⨪ on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane. Under these conditions complex I, complex II, ETF-QOR, the ubiquinone pool, and center o of complex III may all be strongly reduced. In the presence of SOD, H2O2 production with palmitoyl carnitine plus antimycin A appeared to be higher than the sum of the individual contributions from complex I, complex II, ETF-QOR, the ubiquinone pool, and center o of complex III. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear. In general, the rates of H2O2production of liver mitochondria were lower than those of skeletal muscle and heart mitochondria, particularly with succinate or with palmitoyl carnitine as substrate (compare Figs. 4, 5, and6), making reliable interpretations difficult. Liver mitochondria respiring on malate and pyruvate, produced less than 0.2 nmol H2O2/min/mg mitochondrial protein in the absence or presence of SOD (Fig.6 A). The addition of rotenone did not increase H2O2 production, but SOD appeared to increase the rate of H2O2 production in the presence of rotenone (Fig. 6 A). These results appear to suggest that complex I from liver mitochondria generates ROS on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane as well as on the matrix side, but because of the small signal we consider them to be unreliable. Liver mitochondria respiring on succinate did not generate H2O2 (Fig. 6 B), except perhaps for a small signal in the presence of SOD and antimycin A or myxothiazol. Liver mitochondria respiring on palmitoyl carnitine did not produce H2O2 (Fig. 6 C), except perhaps for a small signal in the presence of rotenone, antimycin A, or myxothiazol. However, the rates of H2O2 production were minimal, making it difficult to interpret their significance. In a separate series of experiments, neither rat nor pigeon heart mitochondria generated measurable amounts of H2O2 when supplemented with malate and pyruvate (Fig.7 A). The addition of rotenone increased the rate of H2O2 production in both species (Fig. 7 A). In the presence of rotenone, the H2O2 production rate per mg of mitochondrial protein was higher with rat mitochondria than pigeon mitochondria (Fig.7 A). The amount of complex I present in the two types of mitochondria was measured (Fig. 7 B) to see whether the greater capacity of rat heart mitochondria to produce ROS in the presence of rotenone was caused by a greater concentration of complex I. Complex I was significantly greater in rat mitochondria than in pigeon mitochondria. Fig. 7 C shows that the different capacities for ROS production between rat and pigeon heart mitochondria were lost when H2O2 production rate was expressed per mole of complex I. Mitochondria from rat skeletal muscle, heart, and liver respiring on substrates feeding exclusively to complex I (malate plus pyruvate) or complex II (rotenone plus succinate) in the absence of other inhibitors generated little or no measurable H2O2 (Figs. 4, 5, and 6). The absence of significant generation of H2O2 from mitochondria respiring on complex I and complex II substrates supports results from Staniek and Nohl (12Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 268-275Google Scholar) showing a lack of H2O2 production from rat heart mitochondria respiring on glutamate/malate, malate/pyruvate, and succinate. Hansfordet al. (36Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 89-95Google Scholar) and Liu et al. (20Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Google Scholar) also reported minimal rates of H2O2 production from rat heart, brain, or liver mitochondria with glutamate/malate or rotenone/succinate as substrates. In the absence of rotenone, succinate supports considerable ROS production from complex I by reverse electron transport (e.g. see Ref. 20Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Google Scholar); this aspect was not pursued in the present paper. However, many other studies have reported significant rates of H2O2 production in isolated mitochondria (reviewed in Ref. 13Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 347-366Google Scholar). Most of these studies used SOD in the assay (6Barja G. Cadenas S. Rojas C. Perez-Campo R. Lopez-Torres M. Free Radic. Res. 1994; 21: 317-327Google Scholar, 7Herrero A. Barja G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 98: 95-111Google Scholar, 8Herrero A. Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 241-249Google Scholar, 30Barja G. Herrero A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 235-243Google Scholar). We obtained considerable rates of H2O2 generation in the presence of SOD if we did not correct for background effects (Fig. 2). Therefore, some of the discrepancies in production of H2O2 by mitochondria respiring on complex I and II substrates between various studies might be due to the presence or absence of inhibitors of reversed electron transport or to methodological artifacts as suggested by Forman and Azzi (10Forman H.J. Azzi A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 374-375Google Scholar) and Staniek and Nohl (12Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 268-275Google Scholar). In contrast, rat skeletal muscle and heart mitochondria produced H2O2 at measurable rates when respiring on palmitoyl carnitine with no added inhibitors (Figs. 4 and 5). This H2O2 was produced primarily on the matrix side of the membrane, since it was not significantly enhanced by addition of exogenous SOD. The greater H2O2 production with palmitoyl carnitine than with complex I substrates could be because complex I is more reduced with palmitoyl carnitine, due to reversed electron transport and competition with ETF-QOR for oxidized Q. Greater steady-state reduction of complex I would lead to greater matrix ROS production with palmitoyl carnitine as substrate. Additionally, it could be that ETF-QOR and ETF can also produce O 2⨪ on the matrix side of the membrane when palmitoyl carnitine is added. ETF accepts electrons from eight primary dehydrogenases in the mitochondrial matrix including those of the β-oxidation cycle. ETF is rapidly reduced to the semiquinone form (ETF 2⨪) and more slowly to the fully reduced form, suggesting that ETF 2⨪ is the electron donor to ETF-QOR (31Ramsay R.R. Steenkamp D.J. Husain M. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 883-892Google Scholar). ETF-QOR can be fully reduced by accepting three electrons, but it accepts only two electrons when ETF is the electron donor (32Beckmann J.D. Frerman F.E. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3913-3921Google Scholar). It was proposed that the FAD prosthetic group of ETF-QOR cycles between the oxidized and semiquinone forms (31Ramsay R.R. Steenkamp D.J. Husain M. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 883-892Google Scholar). These data suggest that ETF and ETF-QOR could act as generators of superoxide owing to their presence in partially reduced states during lipid metabolism. Early papers on the production of H2O2 by mitochondria showed that rat liver and pigeon heart mitochondria release H2O2 when respiring on 10 μm palmitoyl carnitine (21Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; : 617-630Google Scholar, 22Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Google Scholar). These results gained little attention since succinate gave higher rates of H2O2 production. However, the lower rates of H2O2 production with palmitoyl carnitine in these early reports might reflect the absence of catalytic carnitine and the use of subsaturating concentrations of palmitoyl carnitine. It is tempting to speculate that increased production of ROS by mitochondria during lipid metabolism might lead to an increase in the expression and activity of UCPs to counteract the deleterious effects of ROS on mitochondria. In fact, UCP2 and UCP3 expression is increased when fatty acids are high (23Samec S. Seydoux J. Dulloo A.G. Faseb J. 1998; 12: 715-724Google Scholar, 24Cadenas S. Buckingham J.A. Samec S. Seydoux J. Din N. Dulloo A.G. Brand M.D. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 257-260Google Scholar). Fatty acids and superoxide activate uncoupling by UCPs, and it was recently suggested that the primary role of UCP2 and UCP3 might be for protection against ROS (25Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Google Scholar). It is commonly repeated that 2% of electron flow during mitochondrial respiration gives rise to H2O2 (33Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Google Scholar). More recently, Hansford et al. (36Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 89-95Google Scholar) reported values of free radical leak in the range of 0.4–0.8% for heart mitochondria respiring on physiological concentrations of succinate (less than 0.5 mm). Even if we consider our results with saturating palmitoyl carnitine (0.15 nmol of H2O2/min/mg of mitochondrial protein) for skeletal muscle mitochondria (Fig. 4), only 0.15% of electron flow gives rise to H2O2under resting conditions with a respiration rate of 200 nmol of electrons/min/mg of mitochondrial protein. This estimate of free radical leak would be lower at physiological partial pressure of oxygen, since the rate of H2O2 production by mitochondria decreases steadily with oxygen tension (22Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Google Scholar). It would be even lower in more physiologically realistic conditions of subsaturating palmitoyl carnitine and lower mitochondrial membrane potential due to background ATP synthesis. Therefore, our upper estimate of free radical leak is one to two orders of magnitude lower than the frequently cited values. The results presented in this paper show that rat heart and skeletal muscle mitochondria generally display considerably higher rates of H2O2 production than liver mitochondria either in the absence or presence of inhibitors, consistent with the idea that postmitotic tissues generate more ROS through accumulation of oxidative damage (34Papa S. Skulachev V.P. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 174: 305-319Google Scholar). A simpler explanation for these results is that liver mitochondria have a reduced content of mitochondrial electron transport chain components compared with heart and skeletal muscle (35Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 16-22Google Scholar). Specifically, rat liver mitochondria have approximately 10 times less complex I and six times less complex III activity than heart or skeletal muscle mitochondria (35Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 373: 16-22Google Scholar). To identify the major potential sites of mitochondrial ROS production and the topology of ROS production from them, we used inhibitors of complex I and III of the electron transport chain. The inhibitors should strongly reduce different respiratory complexes and cause them to generate sufficient ROS to override the natural antioxidant systems of mitochondria. This allowed us to determine which complex has the largest capacity to generate ROS. The presence and absence of SOD permitted the identification of the topology of ROS production. We found that center o of complex III (rotenone plus succinate plus antimycin A) can generate more ROS than complex I (malate plus pyruvate plus rotenone) (Figs. 4 and 5). Center o of complex III generates superoxide (at least in part, and probably exclusively) on the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondrial inner membrane, whereas complex I produces ROS solely on the matrix side. Experiments using mitoplasts indicated that complex III can release superoxide on the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane (18Han D. Williams E. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 411-416Google Scholar). Many studies using intact mitochondria have reported increases in H2O2production in the presence of antimycin A and rotenone (12Staniek K. Nohl H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1460: 268-275Google Scholar, 13Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 347-366Google Scholar, 22Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Google Scholar, 36Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 89-95Google Scholar,37Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 118-126Google Scholar). However, none of these studies examined the topology of ROS production. Mitochondria respiring on complex I substrates increase their H2O2 production in the presence of myxothiazol (13Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 347-366Google Scholar, 36Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 89-95Google Scholar). Since the rates in the presence of rotenone in these studies are similar or higher than those in the presence of myxothiazol, it is probable that the ROS generated in the presence of myxothiazol actually originated from complex I. Finally, the possible SOD-insensitive increase in the rate of H2O2production by mitochondria supplemented with palmitoyl carnitine and myxothiazol leads us to suggest that ETF and ETF-QOR may also produce ROS on the matrix side of the inner membrane (Figs. 4 and 5). At a physiological level, our results showing very low H2O2 production by mitochondria respiring on complex I and II substrates in the absence of inhibitors fail to provide support for the conclusions that there is an inverse relationship between MLSP and H2O2 production by mitochondria from various species (4Sohal R.S. Svensson I. Brunk U.T. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1990; 53: 209-215Google Scholar) or that pigeon mitochondria respiring on complex I or II substrates generate less H2O2 than rat mitochondria (5Ku H.H. Sohal R.S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1993; 72: 67-76Google Scholar, 6Barja G. Cadenas S. Rojas C. Perez-Campo R. Lopez-Torres M. Free Radic. Res. 1994; 21: 317-327Google Scholar, 7Herrero A. Barja G. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 98: 95-111Google Scholar, 8Herrero A. Barja G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 241-249Google Scholar, 30Barja G. Herrero A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 235-243Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that heart mitochondria from pigeons and rats respiring on malate/pyruvate did not generate measurable amounts of H2O2. In the presence of rotenone, however, rat mitochondria produced more H2O2 per mg of mitochondrial protein than did pigeon mitochondria (Fig.7 A), showing that the capacity of rat mitochondria to generate ROS is indeed higher. This was caused by a higher content of complex I in rat heart mitochondria (Fig. 7 B). The rates of ROS production per mole of complex I were not higher in rat mitochondria, suggesting that complex I from pigeon heart mitochondria does not have a decreased intrinsic capacity for ROS production. These data confirm that the maximum capacity of pigeon heart mitochondria to generate ROS from complex I is less than in rat, but fail to provide support for the theory that the elevated MLSP of pigeons compared with rats is partially due to their lower endogenous mitochondrial production of H2O2. It would be enlightening to compare mitochondrial H2O2 production between animals of different MLSP using palmitoyl carnitine. Finally, our results should not be interpreted as meaning that mitochondria produce no ROS under physiological conditions, where the major substrates will usually be pyruvate from glycolysis or long chain fatty acyl carnitines from lipid oxidation. Our results suggest that if complexes I and III of mitochondria do produce ROS physiologically during oxidation of pyruvate through the Krebs cycle, these ROS are mostly scavenged by antioxidant defense systems and little or no H2O2 escapes into the cytosol. On the other hand, fatty acid β-oxidation does lead to release of ROS, primarily from complex I on the matrix side of the inner membrane, which can lead to H2O2 spilling out into the cytosol. However, it is important to emphasize that whatever the substrate, complex I, complex III, and perhaps ETF and ETF-QOR do have the capacity to generate superoxide. A consistent small leak of electrons to oxygen that escapes the antioxidant defense systems during normal metabolism might still be sufficient to cause accumulation of oxidative damage, ultimately resulting in aging.

https://openalex.org/W2106020004,"β-Amyloid accumulation is associated with pathologic changes in the brain in Alzheimer's disease and has recently been identified in plaques of another chronic inflammatory disorder, atherosclerosis. The class B scavenger receptor, CD36, mediates binding of fibrillar β-amyloid to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, including brain macrophages (microglia). In this study, we demonstrate that in microglia and other tissue macrophages, β-amyloid initiates a CD36-dependent signaling cascade involving the Src kinase family members, Lyn and Fyn, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase, p44/42. Interruption of this signaling cascade, through targeted disruption of Src kinases downstream of CD36, inhibits macrophage inflammatory responses to β-amyloid, including reactive oxygen and chemokine production, and results in decreased recruitment of microglia to sites of amyloid deposition <i>in vivo</i>. The finding that engagement of CD36 by β-amyloid initiates a Src kinase-dependent production of inflammatory mediators in cells of the macrophage lineage reveals a novel receptor-mediated pro-inflammatory signaling pathway of potential therapeutic importance."

To study the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in osteoclastogenesis of the murine monocytic cell line RAW264.7, which can differentiate into osteoclast-like cells in the presence of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), we treated the cells with specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK, PD169316 and SB203580, and specific inhibitors of MAPK extracellular signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK), U0126 and PD98059. Each inhibitor blocked differentiation into osteoclast-like cells when the cells were plated at the standard cell density (2000–4000 cells per well (96-well)). However, the effect of MEK inhibitors on osteoclastogenesis varied according to the initial cell density during culture, because cell growth was clearly inhibited by them. When the cells were plated at more than 8000 cells per well, marked enhancement and acceleration of the differentiation were observed. In addition, immunoblot analysis revealed that phosphorylation of ERK was increased by treatment with the p38 inhibitors, whereas the MEK inhibitors increased phosphorylation of p38, which implies a seesaw-like balance between ERK and p38 phosphorylation.

Bone is continuously remodeled by bone formation and resorption, and the cooperative bone metabolism is tightly regulated to maintain homeostasis. Deviation from the normal conditions of bone resorption would result in bone diseases such as osteoporosis, osteopetrosis, and periodontal disease. Osteoclasts that are responsible for bone resorption in bone metabolism are multinucleated cells originating from hematopoietic precursor cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. Osteoclast formation requires a cell-to-cell interaction of osteoclast precursor cells with osteoblasts and can be achieved by coculturing bone marrow precursor cells with osteoblasts/stromal cells (1Udagawa N.

In the present study, we investigate the effects of specific inhibitors for MEK and p38 on differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclast-like cells and find that MEK inhibitors enhance and accelerate the differentiation, whereas p38 inhibitors suppress it. In addition, we observe a seesaw-like phosphorylation between ERK and p38 when the cells are treated with the inhibitors for MEK and p38. Polyclonal anti-phospho ERK (E-4) and anti-c-Src were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-ERK, anti-MEK1, anti-phospho-MEK1, monoclonal anti-p38 MAPK (5F11), and anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (28B10) antibodies were fromCell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-C-terminal peptide of cathepsin K was prepared as described previously (20Kamiya T. Kobayashi Y. Kanaoka K. Nakashima T. Kato Y. Mizuno A. Sakai H. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 752-759Google Scholar). RANKL was from Peprotech EC Ltd. (London, UK). PD169316, SB203580, U0126, and PD98059 were purchased from Calbiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Minimal essential medium alpha modification (α-MEM, glutamine-free), and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The murine monocytic cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC, Rockville, MD) was cultured in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 in air) at 37 °C, and maintained on 9-cm diameter uncoated plastic dishes in α-MEM containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) with 2 mm Gln, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For osteoclastogenesis experiments, the indicated number of cells was seeded on a 96-well tissue culture plate with 2 mm Gln (α-MEM Gln(+)) or without it (α-MEM Gln(−)), in the presence or absence of RANKL and chemical reagents. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4 °C for more than 60 min. The cells were then treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 5 min, followed by rinsing twice with PBS. Finally, the fixed cells were incubated with 0.01% naphthol AS-MX phosphate (Sigma) and 0.05% fast red violet LB salt (Sigma) in the presence of 50 mm sodium tartrate and 90 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) for TRAP staining and rinsed twice with PBS. For immunostaining, the cells fixed on the plate were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary antibody that was diluted with the blocking buffer (5% skim milk and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS). After washing with PBS, the plates were treated with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS to inhibit the endogenous peroxidase activity. The cells were then stained by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method using the Histofine SAB-PO kit (Nichirei Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the plates were incubated with 0.5 mm 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride and 0.005% H2O2 in PBS. Immunoreactive sites were visualized as brown benzidine precipitates. The counterstaining for nuclei was performed with methyl green. Following TRAP staining, the plates were scanned by a transparent light scanner, and the red color image was extracted from the scanned image using PhotoShop (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). The intensity of the red color image was measured using Image (National Institutes of Health) and is represented here as TRAP intensity. Cell proliferation was measured using a Cell Counting kit (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Similar to the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl 2H-tetrazolium bromide assay, this kit measures intracellular mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity in living but not in dead cells by forming water-soluble formazan dye with the tetrazolium compound, WST-1, a sodium salt of 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]-1,3-benzene disulfonate. Cells were seeded at 5 × 106 cells/well on a 24-well plate and kept in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 in air) at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were stimulated with RANKL or/and other chemical reagents and incubated for the indicated time. After the incubation time, the cells in the 24-well plate were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, followed by addition of 50 μl of SDS-sample buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The whole cell lysate was then treated in ice-cold water by sonication (15-s pulse length ×2 with 60-s interval, Bioruptor UDC-200T, Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan). After boiling for 5 min, 4–7 μl of the lysate (20 μg of protein) was applied to SDS-12.5% PAGE, and the proteins in the gel were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated in 5% skim milk, 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH7.6, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 1 h, and washed twice with TBST for 5 min, then incubated with an antibody at 2000–4000× dilution in TBST at 4 °C for 16 h. The membrane was washed three times with TBST for 10 min, incubated with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated second antibody at 4000–8000× dilution in TBST at room temperature for 1 h, washed vigorously five times for 10 min, and subjected to chemiluminescence (ECL-plus, Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) to visualize HRP. In some experiments for reprobing, the membrane was treated with 1% SDS and 200 mm mercaptoethanol in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 6.7) at 55 °C for 30 min, followed by three washes with TBST. In an in vitro culture system using osteoclast precursor cells purified from various tissues such as bone marrow, spleen, and liver, it is difficult to avoid contamination with other cell lineages such as T-cells and mesenchymal stromal cells. In this study, we took advantage of RAW264.7, a murine macrophage cell line that can differentiate into osteoclast-like cells in the presence of RANKL (6Hsu H. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Solovyev I.

These results showed that the multinuclear TRAP-positive cells from RAW264.7 cells possessed major characteristics of osteoclasts. Because the initial plating cell density is important for differentiation into chondrocytes (26Seghatoleslami M. Tuan R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 84: 237-248Google Scholar), we tested whether the cell density of RAW264.7 cells at plating affects the differentiation into osteoclast-like cells. The cells were plated in wells at various cell densities and cultured in the presence of RANKL for 5 days. The TRAP intensity of the wells varied according to cell densities (Fig.2, A and B). The intensity peaked at 1000–2000 cells/well in α-MEM Gln(+). Next, we examined whether cell growth could affect the differentiation into osteoclast-like cells. We used α-MEM Gln(−) to down-regulate growth speed. Because Gln concentration in serum is 0.5 mm (27Rohde T. MacLean D.A. Hartkopp A. Pedersen B.K. Eur. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 74: 428-434Google Scholar), the final concentration of Gln in α-MEM Gln(−) containing 10% FCS could be estimated at 0.05 mm. As shown in Fig.2 C, the cell doubling time was 16 h in α-MEM Gln(+) and 24 h in α-MEM Gln(−) during days 2–3, resulting in a 3-fold difference in cell number between Gln(+) and Gln(−) cultures after 5 days. When cells were plated in wells at various cell densities and cultured in α-MEM Gln(−) supplemented with RANKL, the TRAP intensity of the wells peaked at 8000 cells/well. These results indicated that differentiation into osteoclast-like cells might be affected by initial cell density and growth speed. MAPK signaling pathways have been suggested to be critical for osteoclast differentiation. To determine the involvement of the pathways in osteoclastogenesis in this culture system, the cells were treated with specific inhibitors of p38 MAPK, PD169316, and SB203580, and specific inhibitors of MEK, U0126, and PD98059. These inhibitors suppressed the formation of TRAP-positive cells in a dose-dependent fashion, which was consistent with several previous studies (Fig.3 A) (15Lee S.E. Woo K.M. Kim S.Y. Kim H.-M. Wack K.K. Lee Z.H. Kim H.-H. Bone. 2002; 30: 71-77Google Scholar, 16Wei S. Wang M. Teitelbaum S. Ross F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6622-6630Google Scholar, 19Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Google Scholar). Interestingly, the inhibitory effects of these two types of inhibitors on RAW264.7 cells were different. 10 μm PD169316 and SB203580 completely inhibited formation of TRAP-positive cells. On the other hand, a high dose of U0126 and PD98059 failed to completely inhibit formation of TRAP-positive cells, whereupon most of the remaining cells were TRAP-positive and multinucleated, although their size was much smaller than the TRAP-positive multinuclear cells cultured in the absence of inhibitors. Furthermore, cell proliferation in the culture containing RANKL was inhibited with U0126 and PD98059 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas such inhibition of cell growth was not seen in the culture with SB203580 and PD169316 (Fig.3 B). Similar effects of these inhibitors on cell proliferation were observed in the absence of RANKL (data not shown). From these findings, we hypothesized that U0126 and PD98059 suppress cell growth, resulting in an apparent decrease of TRAP-positive cells. To test this hypothesis, cells were seeded at various densities and treated with U0126 and PD98059 in the presence of RANKL. Without inhibitors, TRAP-positive mononuclear cells appeared when seeded at an initial cell density of 8000 cells/well, and no multinuclear cells were observed (Fig. 4, A andB). Surprisingly, with inhibitors, a marked increase of TRAP-positive cells were observed at cell densities of more than 8000 cells/well, compared with those without inhibitors. In several wells, gigantic TRAP-positive multinuclear cells with numerous numbers of nuclei, occupying the entire well bottom, were observed (Fig.4 C, panels PD60/32000,PD20/32000, and U3/128000). The increase of the number of TRAP-positive cells by the MEK inhibitors took place at 6.7–60 μm for PD98059 and 0.3–3 μm for U0126. The difference in effective concentration among these inhibitors might be explained by the difference in the affinity of the inhibitors to the substrate: U0126 was reported to have ∼100-fold higher affinity for MEK than does PD98059 (28Favata M. Horiuchi K. Manos E. Daulerio A. Stradley D. Feeser W. Van Dyk D. Pitts W. Earl R. Hobbs F. Copeland R. Magolda R. Scherle P. Trzaskos J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Google Scholar). The cells were proliferated and fused to form multinuclear osteoclast-like cells during 3 days of this experiment. Measuring by the Cell Counting kit, cell density for the most effective multinuclear osteoclastogenesis after 3 days culture was equivalent to 128,000–256,000 cells/well (96-well) of freshly seeded mononuclear cells that completely covers the well bottom (data not shown).Figure 4Enhancement of osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells by treatment with the specific inhibitors of MEK , U0126, and PD98059. The indicated number of cells was seeded and cultured for 3 days in 250 μl of α-MEM Gln(+) in the presence of 10 ng/ml RANKL and the indicated concentration of MEK inhibitors using 96-well tissue culture plates. The cells were fixed and stained for TRAP (A). The plates were directly scanned, and the TRAP intensity of each well was determined (B). Cell shapes in the cultures with various concentrations (micromolar) of U0126 (U) and PD98059 (PD)/various initial cell numbers per well indicated are shown (C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the differentiation into osteoclasts consisted of multistep phases, including cell adhesion, proliferation, fusion, and differentiation, the culture period needed for differentiation are relatively long. It takes at least 3 days and sometimes more than 10 days to differentiate into TRAP-positive multinuclear cells. We investigated whether the MEK inhibitors could accelerate differentiation into TRAP-positive multinuclear cells. To address this issue, cells were cultured with or without the MEK inhibitors in the presence of RANKL for 1–5 days (Fig.5). Without the MEK inhibitors, a very small number of TRAP-positive mononuclear cells appeared on day 2, and multinuclear cells were observed from day 4. When the MEK inhibitor U0126 was added, a large number of TRAP-positive multinuclear cells with higher TRAP intensity than the cells without the inhibitor appeared on day 2. The TRAP intensity of RAW264.7 cells treated with U0126 was higher than that of the cells without U0126 all through the incubation period; however, the TRAP intensity of the cells without U0126 finally reached almost the same level as that of the cells with U0126. These results indicated that the MEK inhibitors accelerated and enhanced differentiation into TRAP-positive multinuclear cells in RAW264.7 cells. RANKL belongs to the TNF superfamily and is known to activate MAPKs, which is believed to be one of pivotal pathways for osteoclastogenesis. To determine the effects of the MAPK inhibitors on signaling pathways, we performed immunoblot analysis with antibodies binding to phosphorylated MAPK molecules. The phosphorylation of ERK and p38 was increased within 10 min after RANKL stimulation, reached maximum after 30–60 min, and thereafter gradually decreased (Fig.6 A). The phosphorylation of ERK and p38 depended on the concentration of RANKL (Fig.6 B). The phosphorylation of ERK stimulated with RANKL was completely inhibited by U0126 (Fig. 7,upper panel, comparing lanes 2 to 4) and that of p38 was inhibited with SB203580 (Fig. 7, lower panel, comparing lanes 2 to 6). Interestingly, phosphorylation of ERK by treatment with RANKL was up-regulated in the presence of SB203580 (Fig. 7, upper panel, comparing lanes 2 to 6), whereas SB203580 treatment had no effect on ERK phosphorylation in the absence of RANKL (Fig. 7, upper panel, comparing lanes 1to 5), suggesting that inhibition of p38 might induce phosphorylation of ERK.Figure 7Phosphorylation of ERK and p38 in RAW264.7 cells treated with RANKL and MAPK inhibitors. Cells were treated with 1.25 μm U0126 or SB203580 in the presence of 10 ng/ml RANKL and collected after 30 min, followed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-ERK or -p38.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) New et al. (29New L. Li Y. Ge B. Zhong H. Mansbridge J. Liu K. Han J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 585-596Google Scholar) have recently reported a similar result, in which they observed the enhancement of ERK phosphorylation by treatment with SB203580 in PC12 cells in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF). Their finding prompted us to investigate the possibility of cross-talk between ERK and p38. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with combinations of various concentrations of U0126 and SB203580 in the presence of RANKL and subjected to immunoblot analyses with anti-phospho-ERK and anti-phospho-p38. Phosphorylation of ERK was markedly decreased with U0126 and was clearly increased in the presence of SB203580 (Fig.8 A). On the other hand, phosphorylation of p38 was increased with U0126 in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of SB203580, whereas the increase by treatment with U0126 did not occur in the absence of SB203580 (Fig. 8 B). Taken together, the p38 inhibitor increased the phosphorylation of ERK, and the MEK inhibitor increased that of p38. Phosphorylation of ERK peaked after 30 min in the absence of SB203580, and the presence of SB203580 delayed the peak of ERK phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8 A). Such a delay of phosphorylation was not obvious in p38 (Fig. 8 B). Because the above results suggested that a cross-talk might take place between MEK- and ERK-mediated pathways, we investigated the combined effect of MEK and p38 inhibitors on osteoclastogenesis of RAW264.7 cells. As described before (Fig. 4), RANKL-induced formation of TRAP-positive cells was enhanced by addition of U0126. The enhanced formation of TRAP-positive cells was suppressed by addition of SB203580 (Fig. 9). In this report, the effects of MEK and p38 inhibitors on differentiation of RAW264.7 into osteoclast-like cells were investigated. MEK inhibitors markedly enhanced osteoclastogenesis in the presence of RANKL, whereas p38 inhibitors suppressed it. Because chemical inhibitors against signal transduction are powerful tools to explore signaling pathways, their use has become more widespread to investigate what pathways are involved in cell responses such as growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. Osteoclasts are differentiated from hematopoietic precursor cells, and the signal transduction pathways for osteoclast differentiation have been studied. Several research groups have investigated the involvement of MAPKs in this signaling pathway (15Lee S.E. Woo K.M. Kim S.Y. Kim H.-M. Wack K.K. Lee Z.H. Kim H.-H. Bone. 2002; 30: 71-77Google Scholar, 16Wei S. Wang M. Teitelbaum S. Ross F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6622-6630Google Scholar, 19Matsumoto M. Sudo T. Saito T. Osada H. Tsujimoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31155-31161Google Scholar). They concluded that MEK inhibitors suppress or do not affect differentiation into osteoclasts from bone marrow cells. Although the cells used here are different from the cells they used, we obtained similar results when RAW264.7 cells were cultured at a particular cell density for a defined period. For example, osteoclastogenesis was inhibited at the initial cell density of 2000 cells/well in the presence of MEK inhibitor (Figs. 3 and 5), whereas such inhibition was not observed at 4000 cells/well (Fig. 5). In this study, we found that the MEK inhibitors did enhance differentiation into osteoclast-like cells at initial cell densities of more than 8000 cells/well. Differentiation into osteoclasts requires multiple steps: cell attachment to the plate as a scaffold, cell proliferation, differentiation to mononuclear TRAP-positive cells, and fusion of the TRAP-positive mononuclear cells to yield multinuclear TRAP-positive cells. Because each step is indispensable for the differentiation, impairment of each step could result in failure of osteoclast differentiation. MEK inhibitors clearly inhibited growth in RAW264.7 cells, which may explain the apparent inhibition of osteoclastogenesis with MEK inhibitors at the cell density commonly used, because we found enhancement and acceleration of osteoclastogenesis by treatment with MEK inhibitors at higher cell densities (Figs. 4 and 5) that could allow the cells to skip the cell proliferation step and immediately differentiate into osteoclasts. The duration of ERK activation has been suggested to be critical for the fate of signals (29–42). For example, EGF transiently stimulates the ERK pathway in PC12 cells leading to proliferation, whereas nerve growth factor causes a sustained response that evokes neuronal differentiation (29New L. Li Y. Ge B. Zhong H. Mansbridge J. Liu K. Han J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 585-596Google Scholar, 34Marshall C. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Google Scholar). In this study, the greater the amount of SB203580 added to the culture system, the larger the delay of ERK phosphorylation observed (Fig. 8 A), with the result that SB203580 inhibited osteoclastogenesis (Fig. 9). Not only the inhibition of p38 phosphorylation with SB203580, but also the delayed up-regulation and duration of ERK phosphorylation with the same inhibitor may be involved in the inhibition of differentiation of RAW264.7 cells into osteoclast-like cells. Immunoblot analyses using antibodies against phosphorylated MAPKs revealed a “seesaw cross-talk” between ERK and p38: p38 inhibitors caused a decrease of phosphorylated p38 with an increase of phosphorylated ERK, whereas MEK inhibitors caused decrease of phosphorylated ERK with increase of phosphorylated p38. A similar seesaw cross-talk was previously reported, in which SB203580 by itself did not affect the activity of ERK1/2 but significantly extended EGF-induced ERK activation in PC12 cells (29New L. Li Y. Ge B. Zhong H. Mansbridge J. Liu K. Han J. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 83: 585-596Google Scholar). How can the seesaw cross-talk occur? It is unlikely that the secondary products derived from transcripts by transcription factors downstream of a MAPK pathway affected the other MAPK pathway, because the enhancement of phosphorylation by MAPK inhibitors took place after only 30 min. Does the cross-talk take place upstream of MAPKs? Although MEK has been suggested to be a substrate of ERK for feedback signaling (43Brunet A. Pages G. Poussegur J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 299-303Google Scholar), we did not detect any obvious increase or decrease of phosphorylated MEK by treatment with p38 inhibitors (data not shown), suggesting that the increment of phosphorylation of ERK by the p38 inhibitor may have occurred downstream from MEK. However, MEKK1, an upstream mediator of the MEK pathway, has been reported to act as an E3 ligase and mediate ubiquitination and degradation of ERK1/2 (44Lu Z. Xu S. Joazeiro C. Cobb M.H. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 945-956Google Scholar), which suggested that a signal transduction molecule can directly suppress other signaling molecules as well as implied that the seesaw cross-talk may occur upstream of MEK. Phosphatases or scaffold proteins for MAPKs pathways can also be the candidates involved in the above events. Alternatively, the chemical inhibitors of MAPKs may affect other unknown molecules. Recently, SB203580 has been reported to inhibit a nucleoside transporter, which leads to the inhibition of uridine-uptake followed by the inhibition of differentiation of K562 erythroleukemia cells (45Huang M. Wang Y. Collins M. Gu J. Mitchell B. Graves L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28364-28367Google Scholar). Their finding may not be directly linked to the results in this study, but suggests the possibility that the chemical inhibitors may affect more than one molecule. The stream of signal transduction may be comparable to that of a river with downstream branches in the natural scenery: when a branch point of signaling pathways is activated, the signal should flow to both downstream pathways. If one downstream pathway is blocked by treatment with inhibitors, the signal may flow more along the other pathway. To resolve the complexity of signal transduction, mathematical models have been studied (39Heinrich R. Neel B. Rapoport T. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 957-970Google Scholar, 46Asthagiri A. Lauffenburger D. Biotechnol. Prog. 2001; 17: 227-239Google Scholar), in which the feedback mechanisms and signal propagation have been analyzed. Further studies are needed to clarify the reciprocal effects of MAPK inhibitors on osteoclastogenesis and to elucidate the mechanism by which the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by MEK inhibitors results in p38 phosphorylation and, conversely, so does the inhibition of p38 phosphorylation in ERK phosphorylation (Fig.10).

However, little is known about other roles of the endocannabinoid system in brain. In the present work we provide substantial evidence that the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) regulates neuronal differentiation both in culture and in vivo. Thus AEA, through the CB1 receptor, inhibited cortical neuron progenitor differentiation to mature neuronal phenotype. In addition, human neural stem cell differentiation and nerve growth factor-induced PC12 cell differentiation were also inhibited by cannabinoid challenge. AEA decreased PC12 neuronal-like generation via CB1-mediated inhibition of sustained extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, which is responsible for nerve growth factor action. AEA thus inhibited TrkA-induced Rap1/B-Raf/ERK activation. Finally, immunohistochemical analyses by confocal microscopy revealed that adult neurogenesis in dentate gyrus was significantly decreased by the AEA analogue methanandamide and increased by the CB1 antagonist SR141716. These data indicate that endocannabinoids inhibit neuronal progenitor cell differentiation through attenuation of the ERK pathway and suggest that they constitute a new physiological system involved in the regulation of neurogenesis.

AEA and 2AG were from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI); rabbit polyclonal anti-Rap1 (sc-65), B-Raf (C-19), Trk (C-14), and mouse monoclonal anti-phosphorylated ERK (E-4) and anti-phosphorylated Elk (sc-8406) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); methanandamide (M-AEA), mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin III and anti-α-tubulin antibodies from Sigma; anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody clone PY20 from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); and [γ-32P]ATP from AmershamBiosciences. Cortical neuron progenitors, obtained from 17-day-old rat embryos, were cultured in chemically defined medium supplemented with B27 to differentiate into neurons (16Blázquez C. Galve-Roperh I. Guzmán M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). HNSC.100 cells were cultured as described (17Villa A. Snyder E.Y. Vescovi A. Martı́nez-Serrano A. Exper. Neurol. 2000; 161: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and differentiation experiments were performed in chemically defined medium in the presence of 1% bovine serum albumin and the mentioned stimuli during 1 week. Cell culture medium was replaced every 2 days. PC12 cells in low serum medium (2% heat inactivated horse serum and 1% calf serum) were transfected with hCB1 cDNA using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and subsequently stimulated with the indicated agents. Differentiation experiments were carried out in the presence of 100 ng/ml NGF for 48 h. Cell viability was determined by the MTT test, Trypan Blue exclusion, or Hoechst 33258 staining (16Blázquez C. Galve-Roperh I. Guzmán M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2315-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of cellular effectors were prepared in Me2SO except for NGF and isoproterenol, which were prepared in PBS. No significant influence of Me2SO on any of the parameters determined was observed at the final concentration used (0.1%, v/v). Control incubations included the corresponding vehicle content. Western blots were performed essentially as previously described (13Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Cortés M.L. Gómez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzmán M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 18Rueda D. Galve-Roperh I. Haro A. Guzmán M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 814-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After stimulation, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped in lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 μm microcystin-LR, 17.5 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 μg/ml benzamidine. Cell lysates cleared by 15 min of centrifugation at 12,000 × g were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For Trk A Western blotting high voltage transfer conditions were employed to allow high molecular weight proteins to be efficiently transferred. After incubation with primary antibodies (1:1000), blots were developed with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:20,000) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit. Loading controls were performed with an anti-α-tubulin antibody. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein from cleared cell lysates were incubated with 2 μg of anti-TrkA antibody precoupled to protein G-Sepharose. After washing with lysis buffer TrkA phosphorylation extent was determined in the immunoprecipitate by Western blot using the PY20 antibody. Active Rap1 was pulled down from cleared cell lysates (250 μg) with GST-RalGDS fusion protein precoupled to GSH-Sepharose (19Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and visualized by Western blot using an anti-Rap1 antibody. Endogenous B-Raf was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody, and kinase activity was determined in the presence of myelin basic protein. Substrate phosphorylation was determined after 12% SDS-PAGE by autoradiography and scintillation counting of the excised bands (13Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Cortés M.L. Gómez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzmán M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Adult Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneal with 5 mg/kg/day M-AEA (n = 6) or 1 mg/kg/day SR141716 (n = 4) dissolved in PBS/Tween 80/ethanol (18:1:1 v/v/v; 1 ml/kg body weight), or equal amounts of vehicle (n = 8) for four consecutive days. At day 2 of cannabinoid treatment, 100 mg/kg 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was administered together with the cannabinoid, and a second injection of BrdUrd alone was performed 2 h later. Thereafter, animals received M-AEA, SR141716, or vehicle on alternative days until perfusion on day 16 to allow newly generated cells to acquire appropriate neuronal phenotype and functionality (20Gould E. Gross C.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 619-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Animal procedures were performed according to the Research Ethical Committee from Complutense University. Perfusion and immunohistochemistry were performed as described (21Martı́nez-Serrano A. Bjorklund A. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4604-4616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using 30 μm coronal free-floating sections. Sections were incubated with rat anti-BrdUrd (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and mouse anti-Neu N monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) followed by adequate secondary Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Five coronal sections per rat, located between 2.8 and 4.3 mm posterior to bregma, were examined using a Microradiance confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), three passes with a Kalman filter and a 512 × 512 collection box. BrdUrd-positive cells were counted in the subgranular zone and granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus, and confirmation that BrdUrd staining revealed proliferating neuron progenitors but not DNA-repairing cells was assessed by the following criteria: (i) BrdUrd-labeled cells showed small size and irregular shape characteristic of newly born cells, (ii) cells often appeared in clusters, and in certain cases mitotic figures were observed, (iii) no condensed nuclei characteristic of apoptotic cells were observed at any time. Similar experiments were also performed with a mouse anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by incubation with a biotinylated anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and subsequent development with nickel 3–3′-diaminobenzidine as chromogen. Results shown represent the means ± S.D. of the number of experiments indicated in every case. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance. A post hoc analysis was made by the Student-Neuman-Keuls' test. In vivo data (Fig. 5) were analyzed by a unpaired Student'st test. We monitored the differentiation of cortical neuron progenitors from 17-day-old rat embryos into mature neurons. As shown in Fig. 1 A, AEA treatment decreased the amount of cells with neurites as visualized by immunocytochemistry with an anti-β-tubulin III antibody. Quantification of AEA action on cortical neurite outgrowth is represented in Fig. 1 B. Importantly, AEA-induced inhibition of cortical neuron development was mediated by the CB1receptor as shown by SR141716 antagonism (Fig. 1, A andB). AEA-induced reduction of neuronal development was not associated with a decrease in cell viability as determined by the MTT test and Hoechst 33258 staining (data not shown). In parallel with the decrease in neurite outgrowth, AEA delayed the appearance of the early neuronal marker β-tubulin III (Fig.1 C, upper panel). Moreover, loss of vimentin expression, a characteristic marker of neuroepithelial progenitors, during the neuronal differentiation process was prevented by AEA (Fig.1 C, lower panel). Finally, AEA decreased the expression of the mature neuronal marker Neu N after 4 days of in vitro differentiation (Fig. 1 D). AEA-mediated loss of neuronal markers was prevented by SR141716 (Fig. 1 D), thus pointing to the involvement of the CB1 receptor. To further generalize the AEA effects on neural cell development a human neural stem cell line (HNSC.100) (17Villa A. Snyder E.Y. Vescovi A. Martı́nez-Serrano A. Exper. Neurol. 2000; 161: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and PC12 cells were also employed. HNSC.100 is a stable multipotent neural stem cell line that can differentiate into the three major cell lineages of the nervous system (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes) after serum deprivation. Moreover, this cell line engrafts and differentiatesin vivo after transplantation (17Villa A. Snyder E.Y. Vescovi A. Martı́nez-Serrano A. Exper. Neurol. 2000; 161: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 22Rubio F.J. Bueno C. Villa A. Navarro B. Martı́nez-Serrano A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Expression of the CB1 receptor was first analyzed as its presence would constitute a prerequisite for endocannabinoids to target the HNSC.100 cell endogenous differentiation program. HNSC.100 cells expressed CB1 at similar levels than cortical neuron progenitors employed as positive control (Fig.2 A). Like in cortical neuron progenitors, the expression of β-tubulin during the differentiation process was inhibited by AEA in a CB1-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). In addition, the AEA-stable analogue M-AEA mimicked AEA action. We extended our experiments to the widely employed NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation model (23Vaudry D. Stork P.J.S. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Cannabinoids did not modify NGF-induced differentiation of naive PC12 cells in agreement with their lack of CB1 expression both in the undifferentiated and differentiated state (data not shown). Further experiments were therefore performed in PC12 cells transfected with the human CB1 cDNA, and confirmation of concomitant CB1 expression was obtained (Fig. 2 A). AEA decreased NGF-induced neurite generation (Fig. 2, C andD), and the same effect was observed with M-AEA, 2AG, and the synthetic cannabinoid HU-210 (Fig. 2 C). SR141716 prevented cannabinoid-induced inhibition of PC12 cell differentiation (Fig. 2, C and D), therefore evidencing the involvement of the CB1 receptor. In contrast, the vanilloid receptor antagonist capsazepin had no effect (data not shown). Together with the observed reduction in the number of neurite-bearing cells, AEA decreased the amount of β-tubulin III expression without any cytotoxic action as determined by the MTT test and cell viability counting (data not shown). In summary, endocannabinoids inhibit NGF-induced neuronal-like differentiation of PC12 cells similarly to what occurs with human stem cells and cortical neuron progenitors. As cannabinoids modulate the ERK signaling pathway (6Porter A.C. Felder C.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 2001; 90: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 12Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 19-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and ERK activation is a crucial event for PC12 differentiation to a neuronal-like phenotype (23Vaudry D. Stork P.J.S. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 24Derkinderen P. Enslen H. Girault J.A. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: R24-R34PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that endocannabinoid inhibition of PC12 cell differentiation was due to the modulation of this signaling pathway. In agreement with previous reports (25York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 26Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 27Wu C. Lai C. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5406-5416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NGF induced a robust and persistent ERK activation in PC12 cells (Fig. 3 A), and such effect was greatly attenuated by AEA exposure. Thus AEA decreased the potency of NGF-induced ERK activation and accelerated the decline of such activation (Fig. 3 B). Importantly, AEA-mediated ERK inhibition relied on the CB1 receptor as shown by SR141716 antagonism (Fig. 3 C). We subsequently determined the AEA effect on NGF-induced phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk. ERK-mediated Elk phosphorylation upon NGF stimulation is an essential step for transcriptional regulation required for neuronal differentiation (28Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In agreement with its inhibitory action on the ERK signaling pathway, AEA reduced NGF-induced Elk phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). To address the mechanism of AEA action on NGF-induced differentiation, tyrosine phosphorylation of the TrkA receptor was determined following immunoprecipitation. NGF-induced TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by AEA (Fig. 3 D), and this effect relied on CB1 activation. Thus, endocannabinoids inhibit NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation by interfering with NGF signaling events responsible for activation of the differentiation program. Comprehensive studies have shown that whereas the classical Ras/Raf-1-mediated short-term ERK activation leads to PC12 cell proliferation, the Rap1/B-Raf-mediated module that results in sustained ERK activation is required for cell differentiation (25York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 26Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar,28Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). To dissect the specific signaling route affected by cannabinoids, transfection experiments were performed with the cDNA encoding the constitutive forms of the small GTPases Ras and Rap1. Interestingly, while Rap1V12 abolished the inhibitory AEA action on NGF-induced cell differentiation, RasV12 was without significant effect (Fig.4 A), therefore indicating that Rap1- but not Ras-dependent signaling pathway is involved in the inhibition of neuronal-like differentiation by AEA. Moreover, transfection with the cDNA encoding the native form of the MEK kinase B-Raf, a major downstream target of Rap1 activation (24Derkinderen P. Enslen H. Girault J.A. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: R24-R34PubMed Google Scholar), also abrogated AEA inhibition of neurite outgrowth (Fig. 4 A). As increased cyclic AMP levels are known to activate the Rap1/ B-Raf signaling pathway by different mechanisms (28Vossler M.R. Yao H. York R.D. Pan M.G. Rim C.S. Stork P.J.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 29Rooij J. Fried J.T. Zwartkruis F.J.T. Verheijen M.H.G. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.B. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar, 30Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Gaybriel A.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25482-25848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (196) Google Scholar), this approach was employed to obtain further evidence that cannabinoids inhibit Rap1/B-Raf signaling. Thus the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin and the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol blocked AEA action, both in terms of differentiation (Fig. 4 B) and ERK inhibition (data not shown). Finally, AEA action on Rap1 and B-Raf activation was determined. NGF activated both Rap1 and B-Raf, and this effect was blunted by AEA and M-AEA. Importantly, SR141716 was able to antagonize AEA action, indicating the involvement of the CB1 receptor (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, incubation with AEA alone decreased basal Rap1 and B-Raf activity in resting cells (data not shown). In summary, cannabinoid stimulation of PC12 cells decreases NGF-mediated Rap1/B-Raf activation, thereby attenuating ERK activation that ultimately results in reduced neuronal-like PC12 cell differentiation. To analyze if endocannabinoid-mediated reduction of neuronal development occurred in vivo, neurogenesis was determined in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of adult rats injected with vehicle or M-AEA. Neurogenesis in vivo was determined by confocal analysis of newly generated cells labeled with BrdUrd. No significant differences were observed in the total amount of dividing cells (BrdUrd+) per rat (Fig.5 A), therefore excluding a toxic effect of M-AEA treatment. However M-AEA increased Neu N-negative cells within the newly generated cells. Thus, in parallel with a significant decrease in the percentage of double positive Neu N/BrdUrd-labeled cells there was an increased percentage of Neu N-negative BrdUrd-positive cells (Fig. 5 B). To strengthen the hypothesis that endocannabinoids modulate neurogenesis in vivo we tested the effect of SR141716. Blockade of the endogenous cannabinoid tone with the CB1 antagonist enhanced neurogenesis as shown by the increase in the percentage of Neu N/BrdUrd-labeled cells. This was accompanied by a decrease of Neu N-negative cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Representative examples of immunohistochemistry images obtained with two different anti-BrdUrd antibodies (Fig. 5, C andD) confirm the existence of newly dividing cells in the dentate gyrus of adult animals. These neural progenitor cells in vivo can develop into neuronal cells with the appropriated phenotype and functionality (32Van Praag H. Schinder A.F. Christie B.R. Toni N. Palmer T.D. Gage F. Nature. 2002; 415: 1030-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 D). Thus cannabinoid administration diminishes the ability of neuronal progenitors to reach a mature neuronal phenotype in vivo in line with the observed reduction of neuronal generation in vitro. Here we show that endocannabinoids are able to inhibit neuronal differentiation in different cellular models in vitro, and this correlates with their ability to inhibit adult hippocampal neurogenesis in vivo. These findings may have important biological implications as the endocannabinoid system is abundantly expressed in the hippocampus where it plays an active role in normal brain physiology (5Piomelli D. Giuffrida A. Calignano A. Rodrı́guez de Fonseca F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 218-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 7Wilson R.I. Nicoll R.A. Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 8Schlicker E. Kathmann M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 565-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). Moreover, endocannabinoid levels and CB1 receptor expression follow a defined pattern during brain development (33Fernández-Ruiz J. Berrendero F. Hernández M.L. Ramos J.A. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 23: 14-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate for the first time that the endocannabinoid system may be involved in the control of neurogenesis, a notion supported by the observed enhancement of neurogenesis by blockade of the endogenous cannabinoid tone. Several physiological or environmental stimuli are known to modulate adult neurogenesis (20Gould E. Gross C.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 619-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Duman R.S. Malberg J. Nakagawa S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar). Thus endocannabinoids may constitute an additional factor to be added to those that negatively influence adult neurogenesis such as stress, age, glucocorticoids, and opiates (34Duman R.S. Malberg J. Nakagawa S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar). Adult neurogenesis is proposed to be involved in cognition and brain repair (20Gould E. Gross C.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 619-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Duman R.S. Malberg J. Nakagawa S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar). For example, formation and improvement of certain forms of memory are influenced by adult neurogenesis (20Gould E. Gross C.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 619-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Duman R.S. Malberg J. Nakagawa S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 401-407PubMed Google Scholar) as newly generated neurons are rapidly incorporated into functional hippocampal circuits after their generation (32Van Praag H. Schinder A.F. Christie B.R. Toni N. Palmer T.D. Gage F. Nature. 2002; 415: 1030-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar) where they can act as gatekeepers to memory. Thus, besides cannabinoid-mediated neuromodulation and inhibition of hippocampal cell firing (7Wilson R.I. Nicoll R.A. Science. 2002; 296: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 8Schlicker E. Kathmann M. Trends Pharmacol.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8932-8942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibition of neurogenesis in adult hippocampus might help to explain cannabinoid disruption of cognitive processes such as learning and short-term memory. Results presented herein show that endocannabinoids regulate neuronal development by interfering with the ERK signaling pathway responsible for the differentiation program of neuronal multipotent progenitors. These observations are in agreement with the suggested role of endocannabinoids as modulators of neural cell fate (12Guzmán M. Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 19-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Cortés M.L. Gómez del Pulgar T. Izquierdo M. Guzmán M. Nat.

Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 19-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 13Galve-Roperh I. Sánchez C. Cortés M.L. Gómez del Pulgar T.

The important role of the ERK signaling pathway in neuronal differentiation has been extensively studied (23Vaudry D. Stork P.J.S. Lazarovici P. Eiden L.E. Science. 2002; 296: 1648-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 24Derkinderen P. Enslen H. Girault J.A. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: R24-R34PubMed Google Scholar) and constitutes a paradigm for the generation of different cellular outcomes depending on the kinetics, intensity, and signaling environment of the cell. Although NGF-induced ERK activation involves both Ras- and Rap-dependent mechanisms (24Derkinderen P. Enslen H. Girault J.A. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: R24-R34PubMed Google Scholar), Rap1/B-Raf-mediated sustained ERK activation appears to be essential to activate the differentiation program (25York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 26Kao S. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 89: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Here we show that endocannabinoids are able to inhibit NGF-induced signaling events that ultimately result in the inhibition of neuronal generation. AEA decreased NGF-induced TrkA tyrosine phosphorylation and Rap1 and B-Raf activation, finally resulting in attenuated ERK activation. Moreover, AEA-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation was rescued by enhanced activity of the Rap1/B-Raf signaling module, whereas constitutively active Ras was without effect. These results confirm the crucial role of Rap1/B-Raf-dependent sustained ERK activation in neuronal differentiation and show the existence of an inhibitory coupling between neuronal CB1 receptors and the Rap1/B-Raf/ERK pathway. The observed inhibition of NGF-induced ERK activation by cannabinoids via its G-protein-coupled receptor CB1 constitutes a novel paradigm for the signaling links between heptahelical receptors and tyrosine kinase receptors. For example, it is currently well known that G-protein-coupled receptors may activate tyrosine kinase receptors in a process designated as transactivation (reviewed in Refs. 36Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 37Gschwind A. Zwick E. Prenzel N. Leserer M. Ullrich A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1594-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In addition, examples of negative cross-regulation (transinactivation), though less frequent, have also been reported. Thus, bradykinin and ATP can inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation in A431 cells (38Graness A. Hanke S. Boehmer F.D. Presek P. Liebmann C. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 39Langgut W. Ogilvie A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Similarly, estrogen activation of its G-protein-coupled receptor GPR30 mediates the inactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (40Filardo E.J. Quinn J.A. Frackelton A. Bland K.I. Mol.

Moreover, green tea-derived catechins are able to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor receptor phosphorylation by an as yet unknown mechanism (41Sachinidis A. Skach R.A. Seul C. Ko Y. Hescheler J.

In conclusion, we have deciphered a novel signaling mechanism of the CB1 receptor that leads to the inhibition of NGF-induced ERK activation through the attenuation of the Rap1/B-Raf signaling pathway with important consequences in neuronal development.

https://openalex.org/W2019563964,"The RNA-binding protein HuR stabilizes labile mRNAs carrying AU-rich instability elements. This mRNA stabilization can be induced by hypoxia, lipopolysaccharide, and UV light. The mechanism by which these stimuli activate HuR is unclear and might be related to post-translational modification of this protein. Here we show that HuR can be methylated on arginine. However, HuR is not a substrate for PRMT1, the most prominent protein-arginine methyltransferase in mammalian cells, which methylates a number of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins. Instead, HuR is specifically methylated by coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), a protein-arginine methyltransferase previously shown to serve as a transcriptional coactivator. By analyzing methylation of specific HuR arginine-to-lysine mutants and by sequencing radioactively methylated HuR peptides, Arg217 was identified as the major HuR methylation site. Arg217 is located in the hinge region between the second and third of the three HuR RNA recognition motif domains. Antibodies against a methylated HuR peptide were used to demonstrate in vivo methylation of HuR. HuR methylation increased in cells that overexpressed CARM1. Importantly, lipopolysaccharide stimulation of macrophages, which leads to HuR-mediated stabilization of tumor necrosis factor α mRNA in these cells, caused increased methylation of endogenous HuR. Thus, CARM1, which plays a role in transcriptional activation through histone H3 methylation, may also play a role in post-transcriptional gene regulation by methylating HuR.

Mammalian Hu proteins are a family of highly conserved RNA-binding proteins with homology to the Drosophila protein ELAV (embryonic lethal/alteredvisual system) (1Antic D. Keene J.D. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 273-278Google Scholar, 2Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5-7Google Scholar). The four Hu protein family members are HuR (also called HuA), HuB (previously called Hel-N1), HuC, and HuD (3Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol.

Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar). Immunostaining shows HuR to be predominantly nuclear; however, the protein has been shown to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm (8Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Google Scholar), of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA by hypoxia (15Levy N.S.

Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) are among the most commonly methylated proteins in mammalian cells, but other RNA-binding proteins are also substrates for methylation in vitro andin vivo (25Liu Q.

Besides methylating hnRNPs, PRMT1 can methylate other nucleic acid-binding proteins, such as poly(A)-binding protein 2, fibrillarin, nucleolin, and histone H4in vivo (26Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog.

Specific protein substrates have also been identified for PRMT3, JBP1 (PRMT5), and PRMT6, but no substrates have been reported yet for PRMT2 (see Refs. 46Frankel A. Yadav N. Lee J. Branscombe T.L. Clarke S. Bedford M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3537-3543Google Scholarand 47Stallcup M.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3014-3020Google Scholar and references therein). Thus far, arginine methylation of proteins has been implicated in the regulation of gene transcription, signal transduction, and nuclear-cytoplasmic protein transport (36McBride A.E. Silver P.A. Cell. 2001; 106: 5-8Google Scholar,47Stallcup M.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3014-3020Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed changes in cellular levels of protein arginine methylation after a variety of stimuli. For example, the increased methylation of STAT1 parallels its enhanced transcription activation function in response to interferon α/β (48Mowen K.A. Tang J. Zhu W. Schurter B.T. Shuai K. Herschman H.R. David M. Cell. 2001; 104: 731-741Google Scholar). CARM1-directed arginine methylation of histone H3 in the promoters of steroid hormone-responsive genes is induced by steroid hormone treatment of cells (43Ma H. Baumann C.T. Li H. Strahl B.D. Rice R. Jelinek M.A. Aswad D.W. Allis C.D. Hager G.L. Stallcup M.R. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1981-1985Google Scholar). CARM1 methylation also appears to inhibit cAMP-mediated gene expression, preventing the association between transcription factor CREB and cofactor CBP/p300 by methylation of the p300 domain required for CREB binding (45Xu W. Chen H. Du K. Asahara H. Tini M. Emerson B.M. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Science. 2001; 294: 2507-2511Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that, like phosphorylation and acetylation, methylation may play an important role in the transduction of extracellular signals to the transcription machinery. Here, we present evidence that CARM1-directed methylation may also be involved in gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level. We show that HuR associates with and is specifically methylated in vitro by CARM1. Using antibodies that specifically recognize the methylated form of HuR, we demonstrate that HuR is methylated in vivo. The level of HuR methylation is altered by overexpression of CARM1 or by stimulation of macrophages with LPS, which is known to cause HuR-mediated mRNA stabilization (18Dean J.L. Wait R. Mahtani K.R. Sully G. Clark A.R. Saklatvala J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Google Scholar). Our data suggest that methylation by CARM1 plays a role in mRNA stabilization by HuR. COS-7 and RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and Jurkat cells were maintained in RPMI 1640, each supplemented with 1% penicillin and streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum. LPS (Sigma) was added into the medium at 10 μg/ml for 1 h to stimulate RAW 264.7 cells. Construction of plasmids pSG5-HA-CARM1 and pGEX-4T1-CARM1 has been previously reported (42Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Google Scholar). To construct plasmid pET3d-HuR for the expression of full-length recombinant human HuR protein, the coding region was amplified from pGST-HuR (3Ma W.J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8144-8151Google Scholar) by high fidelity PCR using oligonucleotides to engineer anNcoI-compatible BspHI site at the ATG and anNotI site immediately following the last codon of the HuR cDNA. The BspHI-NotI HuR cDNA fragment was inserted into an NcoI-NotI-digested derivative of the pET3d vector (Novagen) encoding a C-terminal hexahistidine and c-myc epitope tag (49Laird-Offringa I.A. Belasco J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11859-11863Google Scholar), yielding pET3d-HuR. The HuR hinge region mutants were made by first creating aBssHII site (GCG/CGC at alanine 204/arginine 205) and an ApaI site (GGG/CCC at glycine 209/proline 210) with silent mutations, resulting in plasmid H918. Bold indicates which nucleotide was mutated to generate the restriction site. The HuR hinge deletion mutant was then made by digestion of H918 with BssHII and NcoI (at methionine 223), blunting, and religation, resulting in deletion of amino acids Arg206–Pro222. The individual arginine-to-lysine hinge region mutants were made by digestion of H918 at preexisting sites PvuII (at glutamine 198/leucine 199) orNcoI (at methionine 223) or the engineered BssHII or ApaI sites (see above), and replacing the intervening sequences with double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the desired mutation. This approach yielded HuR arginine-to-lysine mutants R205K, R206K, R217K, and R219K in the pET3d derivative. The eukaryotic HuR expression plasmids were created from the pET3d constructs by excising the coding region using an EcoRI site just upstream of the ATG and the NotI site just downstream of the last codon and inserting this HuR fragment into a modified vector derived from pSG5-HA (42Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Google Scholar), so that an N-terminal hemagglutinin tag and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag were fused on either end. The resulting HA-HuR protein carried the following additional amino acids: N-terminal to HuR methionine 1, MGYPYDVPDYAEF; C-terminal to HuR Lys326, AAAHHHHHH-stop. GST-PRMT1 (41Lin W.J. Gary J.D.

Baumeister P. Kim E. Roy B. Hsieh T.Y. Lai M. Lee A.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 395-406Google Scholar) expression vectors have been previously described. GST-PRMT2 was kindly provided by Dr. Steven Clarke (UCLA). Peptide P1 (HYHSPARRFGGPVHHQAQRFRFSPMGV-NH2) (AnaSpec Inc.) encoding the HuR hinge domain was generated for in vitro methylation and radiosequencing analysis. To raise an antibody that could specifically recognize methylated HuR (anti-me(R217)HuR antibody), methylated peptide HHQAQ(DMA)FRFSPGC (where DMA represents asymmetric dimethylarginine) was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin before injection into rabbits. Specificity of the antiserum was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with the DMA-containing peptide and a corresponding unmethylated peptide. Approximately 20 h prior to transfection, 1.0 × 106 COS-7 cells were seeded onto 100-mm dishes. Cells were transiently transfected with methyltransferase expression vectors and/or HuR expression vectors by transfection reagent F-2 (Targeting Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cell extracts were prepared by scraping cells into RIPA (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)), followed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min. Cell lysates, prepared as described above (one 100-mm dish of cells/immunoprecipitation sample), were cleared with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. 2 μg of anti-met(R217)HuR or anti-mono/dimethyl arginine (Ab412; Abcam Ltd.) were added to the cell lysates and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. Protein A/G beads were added and incubated for another 3 h. Beads were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Blots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti-HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1 μg/20 ml of blocking buffer (5% (w/v) nonfat milk in TBST: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used at 1 μg/10 ml of blocking buffer and ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used for detection. GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 as described previously (52Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Google Scholar). Hexahistidine fusion proteins were purified with His-Bind Buffer Kit (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Pull-down assays were conducted as described previously (53Ma H. Hong H. Huang S.M. Irvine R.A. Webb P. Kushner P.J. Coetzee G.A. Stallcup M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6164-6173Google Scholar). CARM1 protein was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using the TNT-T7-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). The binding assay was conducted by incubating beads containing 2 μg of His-HuR with slow rotation overnight at 4 °C with 10 μl of the translation reaction in a 500-μl total volume of NETN-0.01% (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 0.01% (v/v) Nonidet P-40). Beads were washed four times with NETN-0.01% and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autofluorography. Methyltransferases were prepared as recombinant GST fusion proteins and eluted from glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) with 20 mm glutathione. 0.5–3 μg of commercially obtained histone H3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or recombinant proteins were incubated with 1 μg of methyltransferase in the presence of 6 μm S-adenosyl-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]AdoMet; 14.7 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mmNaCl, and 0.4 mm EDTA) at 30 °C for 1 h in 35-μl reactions (42Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Google Scholar). SDS-loading buffer or radioimmune precipitation buffer was used to stop the reaction. Labeled proteins were identified by SDS-PAGE and autofluorography for 12 h. To prepare the in vitro methylated samples for immunoprecipitation, nonradiolabeled AdoMet was used instead at 0.1 mm. Approximately 5 μg (1.6 nmol) of [3H]methyl-HuR hinge peptide P1 was purified from a CARM1-catalyzed methylation reaction by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography on a 2.1 × 30-mm RP-300 (C8) column (Brownlee Laboratories). Elution was carried out at 1.0 ml/min using a linear gradient of 5–40% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide was detected by monitoring absorbance at 214 nm. The purified [3H]methyl peptide was found to contain ∼0.07 mol of [3H]methyl/mol of peptide. Two samples (650 pmol each) of the purified peptide were sequenced for 22 cycles by automated Edman degradation on a Hewlett-Packard G1105A sequenator. The first sample was sequenced by standard procedures to verify the correct amino acid sequence and to establish the repetitive yield. For the second sample, the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatized amino acids from each cycle were collected for measurement of 3H by liquid scintillation counting. Because it is unclear how extracellular signals mediate HuR-induced stabilization of labile ARE-containing mRNAs, we sought to establish whether post-translational modification of HuR might play a role. No modifications of HuR (including phosphorylation) have been found as yet. Because arginine methylation is a common modification of RNA-binding proteins, we tested whether HuR could be methylated by one of the PRMTs. Various recombinant PRMTs were incubated with recombinant hexahistidine-tagged HuR (His-HuR) in the presence of [3H]AdoMet, and the products were examined by SDS-PAGE and autofluorography. His-HuR was methylated by CARM1 but not by PRMT1, PRMT2, or PRMT3 (Fig. 1 A,lanes 4–7). Staining of the gel demonstrated that His-HuR and PRMT proteins were present in the appropriate reactions (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4–7), and methylation of known substrates for PRMT1, PRMT3, and CARM1 (hnRNPK, GAR, and histone H3, respectively) verified the specificity and activity of these PRMTs (Fig. 1 A, lane 1–3). (No known substrate for PRMT2 is currently available as a control.) Methylation of degradation products of GST-hnRNP K and His-HuR and an aggregation product of histone H3 was also observed (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1, 2, and7). To further test the substrate specificity of CARM1 for HuR, we investigated whether CARM1 could bind HuR directly in vitro. Either CARM1 or PRMT1 was translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig. 2,lane 1) and incubated with protein-free Ni2+ beads, Ni2+ beads to which His-HuR had been bound, glutathione-agarose beads with bound GST, or glutathione-agarose beads to which GST-hnRNP K had been bound (Fig. 2,lanes 2–5). Strong interactions between CARM1 and His-HuR (lane 3) and between PRMT1 and hnRNP K (lane 5) were observed, whereas no association between the other combinations was detected. Thus, the substrate specificity observed in the in vitro methylation assay is supported by the selective association between the two PRMTs and their respective substrates. Whereas PRMT1 methylation sites are frequently located in Arg-Gly-Gly (RGG) repeats (26Gary J.D. Clarke S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 61: 65-131Google Scholar), neither histone H3, the first identified in vivo substrate for CARM1 (42Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Google Scholar), nor HuR contains RGG repeats. Based upon two CARM1 methylation sites in histone H3, a potential consensus motif, KAXRK, has been proposed (44Schurter B.T. Koh S.S. Chen D. Bunick G.J. Harp J.M. Hanson B.L. Henschen-Edman A. Mackay D.R. Stallcup M.R. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5747-5756Google Scholar). Whereas HuR does not contain KAXRK sequences, we noted that two arginines in the hinge region were preceded by alanine at the −2 position (PARRF and QAQRF) (Fig.3 A). We therefore tested whether an HuR mutant from which a 16-amino acid tract containing the two possible methylation sites had been deleted (Fig. 3 A) could still be methylated. In contrast to intact HuR, which was strongly methylated (Fig. 3 B, left panel, lane 1), no in vitromethylation of this deletion mutant by CARM1 was seen (Fig.3 B, left panel, lane 2), although similar quantities of mutant and wild type HuR proteins were used as substrates (Fig. 3 B, right panel). This result suggests that the hinge region of HuR contains the methylation site(s) or is important for substrate recognition by CARM1. To determine which of the four arginines located in hinge region (Fig.3 A) might be methylated, we generated four point mutants in the context of full-length HuR, each one containing a single arginine-to-lysine substitution. Mutation of arginine 217 to lysine (R217K) completely abolished in vitro methylation of HuR by CARM1, whereas each of the other three HuR mutants (R205K, R206K, and R219K) was methylated to a level comparable with that of wild type HuR (Fig. 3 C). This suggests an essential role of Arg217 as the methylation site and/or as a residue that is important for recognition of HuR by CARM1. We next synthesized a HuR hinge peptide, P1, containing all four arginines (Fig. 3 A). CARM1 efficiently methylated the P1 peptide in vitro, whereas PRMT1 did not (Fig.4 A). Thus, the determinants that mark HuR as a CARM1 substrate are retained in the 27-amino acid P1 sequence. In order to establish directly the location of the methylation site(s), a sample of the peptide, [3H]methyl-labeled by CARM1, was subjected to radiosequencing by automated Edman degradation. Approximately 25% of the 3H was recovered in cycles 7–9, whereas the remaining 75% was recovered in cycles 18–22 (Fig. 4 B). The first peak indicates selective methylation of Arg206.3H recovery in cycles 18–22 includes both Arg217 and Arg219; however, the drop in3H content from cycle 19 (Phe218) to cycle 20 (Arg219) was slightly greater than the drop in the preceding cycle, although the chemical yield of Arg219 was slightly greater than that of Arg217 as determined in a parallel sequencing run (data not shown). This indicates that nearly all of the 3H recovered in cycles 18–22 results from selective methylation of Arg217 with little or no contribution by Arg"

Understanding the molecular constraints of the ATP-binding site of Aurora-2 and the structural basis for interactions with adenosine is an essential step in designing inhibitors for this subfamily of kinases that are both selective and potent. We have determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal catalytic kinase domain of Aurora-2 bound to adenosine at 2.9 Å resolution. This is the first report of a crystal structure of a member of the Aurora family of protein kinases.DISCUSSIONThe catalytic domains of Aurora-1 and Aurora-3 share ∼82% overall sequence homology with Aurora-2, and within the ATP-binding site the three human Aurora kinases are almost identical. In the sphere of protein residues surrounding the bound adenosine molecule, only residue 217, which is threonine in Aurora-2 and glutamic acid in both Aurora-1 and Aurora-3, is not conserved. In Aurora-2, the side chain of Thr-217 makes a hydrogen bond with the main chain of residue Glu-260. This important role of Thr-217 in stabilizing the tertiary structure of the C-terminal kinase lobe suggests that it is not a good target to achieve selectivity for Aurora-2versus Aurora-1 and Aurora-3. Based on this crystal structure and structure-based sequence alignment of Aurora-1 and Aurora-3, it is expected that the design of small inhibitors that are selective for Aurora-2 will be very difficult.It is also apparent from this crystal structure that within the ATP-binding site there are several pockets that could be exploited to gain selectivity for Aurora-2 over the closely related active site structures of CDK-2, GSK-3β, and SRC kinase. In addition, by developing inhibitors that explore parts of the Aurora-2 active site it may be possible to use the novel hydrophobic binding site created at the interface of the activation and glycine-rich loops to gain increased selectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2139188448,"Cells may sense heat shock via the accumulation of thermally misfolded proteins. To explore this possibility, we determined the effect of protein misfolding on gene expression in the absence of temperature changes. The imino acid analog azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC) is incorporated into protein competitively with proline and causes reduced thermal stability or misfolding. We found that adding AZC to yeast at sublethal concentrations sufficient to arrest proliferation selectively induced expression of heat shock factor-regulated genes to a maximum of 27-fold and that these inductions were dependent on heat shock factor. AZC treatment also selectively repressed expression of the ribosomal protein genes, another heat shock factor-dependent process, to a maximum of 20-fold. AZC treatment thus strongly and selectively activates heat shock factor. AZC treatment causes this activation by misfolding proteins. Induction of HSP42 by AZC treatment required protein synthesis; treatment with ethanol, which can also misfold proteins, activated heat shock factor, but treatment with canavanine, an arginine analog less potent than AZC at misfolding proteins, did not. However, misfolded proteins did not strongly induce the stress response element regulon. We conclude that misfolded proteins are competent to specifically trigger activation of heat shock factor in response to heat shock."
https://openalex.org/W1511836437,"We have recently reported that the inhibition of endothelial cell COX-2 by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suppresses αVβ3- (but not α5β1-) dependent Rac activation, endothelial cell spreading, migration, and angiogenesis (Dormond, O., Foletti, A., Paroz, C., and Ruegg, C. (2001) Nat. Med. 7, 1041–1047). Here we investigated the role of the COX-2 metabolites PGE2 and TXA2 in regulating human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion and spreading. We report that PGE2 accelerated αVβ3-mediated HUVEC adhesion and promoted Rac activation and cell spreading, whereas the TXA2 agonist U46619 retarded adhesion and inhibited spreading. We show that the cAMP level and the cAMP-regulated protein kinase A (PKA) activity are critical mediators of these PGE2 effects. αVβ3-mediated adhesion induced a transient COX-2-dependent rise in cAMP levels, whereas the cell-permeable cAMP analogue 8-brcAMP accelerated adhesion, promoted Rac activation, and cell spreading in the presence of the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398. Pharmacological inhibition of PKA completely blocked αVβ3-mediated adhesion. A constitutively active Rac mutant (L61Rac) rescued αVβ3-dependent spreading in the presence of NS398 or U46691, but did not accelerate adhesion, whereas a dominant negative Rac mutant (N17Rac) suppressed spreading without affecting adhesion. α5β1-mediated HUVEC adhesion, Rac activation, and spreading were not affected by PGE2, U46691, 8-brcAMP, or the inhibition of PKA. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that PGE2 accelerates αVβ3-mediated endothelial cell adhesion through cAMP-dependent PKA activation and induces αVβ3-dependent spreading via cAMP- and PKA-dependent Rac activation and may contribute to the further understanding of the regulation of vascular integrins αVβ3 by COX-2/PGE2during tumor angiogenesis and inflammation. We have recently reported that the inhibition of endothelial cell COX-2 by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs suppresses αVβ3- (but not α5β1-) dependent Rac activation, endothelial cell spreading, migration, and angiogenesis (Dormond, O., Foletti, A., Paroz, C., and Ruegg, C.

Tumor angiogenesis, i.e. the formation of new blood vessels in response to angiogenic stimuli, promotes tumor progression by stimulating tumor cell survival, tumor invasion, and metastasis formation (1Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar). Many molecules involved in mediating or regulating angiogenesis have been identified (2Yancopoulos G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge J.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (3298) Google Scholar). They include growth factors (i.e. vascular endothelial growth factors, VEGF) 1The abbreviations used for: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; AC, adenylcyclase; COX, cyclooxygenase; EP, E-prostanoid; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; NSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PAK, p21-activated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PGE, prostaglandin E; PGI, prostaglandin I; PKA, protein kinase A; PLA2, phospholipase A 2; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; TXA2, thromboxane A2. and their cell surface receptors, matrix-degrading enzymes (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases), vascular remodeling ligands, and receptors (i.e. angiopoietins and Tie receptors) and adhesion receptors of the integrin and cadherin families. Integrins are the main receptors for extracellular matrix proteins and consist of two non-covalently associated α and β subunits (3Hynes R.O. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: M33-M37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Integrin ligand binding affinity and adhesion-promoting activity are regulated by intracellular events (“inside out” signaling) (4Kolanus W. Seed B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, integrins rapidly cluster and recruit structural (e.g. α-actinin, talin, vinculin) and signaling (e.g. focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, c-Src) proteins to form characteristic structures called focal contacts or focal adhesions (5Sastry S.K. Burridge K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 261: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Integrins and focal adhesions propagate tensional forces between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton necessary to stabilize cell adhesion and initiate signaling events essential to cell survival, proliferation and differentiation (“outside in” signaling) (6Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3829) Google Scholar). Integrin αVβ3 is highly expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells but not, or to a much lower extent, in quiescent endothelial cells (7Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T.

An anti-αVβ3 function-blocking mAb or an antagonistic RGD-based cyclic peptide suppressed cornea vascularization (10Friedlander M. Brooks P.C. Shaffer R.W. Kincaid C.M. Varner J.A. Cheresh D.A.

Tumstatin, an endogenous degradation fragment of collagen IV, suppresses tumor angiogenesis by interacting with αVβ3 and inhibiting protein synthesis in endothelial cells (14Maeshima Y. Sudhakar A. Lively J.C. Ueki K. Kharbanda S. Kahn C.R. Sonenberg N. Hynes R.O. Kalluri R. Science. 2002; 295: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of tumor vessels by high doses of tumor necrosis factor and interferon γ is associated with the inhibition of the αVβ3 function in endothelial cells (15Ruegg C. Yilmaz A. Bieler G. Bamat J. Chaubert P. Lejeune F.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used therapeutics for the treatment of pain and inflammation. NSAIDs act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity and the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxans (16Vane J.R. Bakhle Y.S. Botting R.M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). There are two known COX isoforms: 1) COX-1, which is ubiquitously expressed and contributes to tissue homeostasis, and 2) COX-2, which is expressed in activated leukocytes and cancer cells and promotes inflammation and cancer progression (17Dubois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van De Putte L.B. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). Prolonged intake of NSAIDs, including COX-2 inhibitors, significantly decreases the risk of developing colon cancer and suppresses the progression of pre-malignant lesions (polyps) (18Oshima M. Dinchuk J.E. Kargman S.L. Oshima H. Hancock B. Kwong E. Trzaskos J.M. Evans J.F. Taketo M.M.

Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Moreover, NSAIDs suppress the progression of established experimental tumors in mice (21Goldman A.P. Williams C.S. Sheng H.

Med. 1999; 190: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that the anti-tumor activity of NSAID involves the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (23Tsujii M. Kawano S.

COX-2 inhibitors decrease VEGF production in fibroblasts and tumor cells and prevent VEGF-induced MAPK activation in endothelial cells (23Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. DuBois R.N.

Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This latter effect was not associated with any detectable changes in either integrin cell surface expression or integrin affinity. We identified suppression of αVβ3-dependent activation of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac as the mechanism by which NSAIDs suppress spreading. Exogenous administration of PGE2or PGI2, but not TXA2, rescued this NSAID effect, thus demonstrating that prostaglandins are critical regulators of αVβ3-mediated endothelial cell spreading and migration. Here, we extend these observations by reporting that prostaglandin E2 accelerated αVβ3-mediated endothelial cell adhesion through the cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA) and induced spreading via cAMP- and PKA-dependent activation of Rac. In contrast, α5β1-mediated endothelial cell adhesion was not regulated by PGE2, intracellular cAMP levels, or PKA activity. Bovine gelatin, bovine plasma fibronectin, human plasma vitronectin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) were purchased from Sigma. Butaprost, PGE1 alcohol, and sulprostone were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). NS-398, PGE2, 8-brcAMP, forskolin, and H-89 were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). U46619 was from Calbiochem. The anti-Rac mAb clone 102 was from BD Biosciences. The DNA molecular weight marker was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were prepared and cultured as previously described (15Ruegg C. Yilmaz A. Bieler G. Bamat J. Chaubert P. Lejeune F.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) except for the use of M199 (Invitrogen) as a basal medium. For electroporation, subconfluent HUVEC were collected and incubated on ice for 5 min with 25 μg of L61Rac- or N17Rac-encoding plasmids or empty plasmid and 5 μg of pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech) in M199 medium without fetal calf serum and electroporated with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). HUVEC were resuspended in complete medium and cultured for 48 h before use in the experiments. Electroporation efficiency (routinely ∼80%) was assessed by the analysis of enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence by flow cytometry. Maxisorp II Nunc enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated with fibronectin (5 μg/ml), gelatin (0.5%), or vitronectin (0.5 μg/ml) in PBS overnight at 4 °C, and assays were done as described previously (15Ruegg C. Yilmaz A. Bieler G. Bamat J. Chaubert P. Lejeune F.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC were resuspended in a serum-free M199 medium and plated at 3 × 104cells/well and incubated at 37 °C. At given times, unattached cells were removed by rinsing the wells with warm PBS. Attached cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Fluka Chemie, Buchs, Switzerland), stained with 0.5% crystal violet (Sigma), and quantified by an optical density reading at 620 nm (Packard Spectra Count). Results are given as optical density values and represent the mean of duplicate wells ± S.D. of specific adhesion (equal to the adhesion on an extracellular matrix protein minus the adhesion on bovine serum albumin). If not stated otherwise, pharmacological agents were added at the time of plating and used at the following concentrations: NS-398, 100 μm; PGE2, 100 ng/ml; 8-brcAMP, 1 mm; H-89, 5 μm; U46619, 50 μm; butaprost, 20 μm; PGE1 alcohol, 10 ng/ml; sulprostone, 25 μm; and forskolin, 10 μm. For spreading determination, the percentage of spread cells was counted in three representative high power fields at different times after plating. Non-spread cells were defined as small round cells with little or no membrane protrusions, whereas spread cells were defined as large cells with extensive visible lamellipodia (26Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Results represent the percentage of spread cells in three high power fields ± S.D. HUVEC were plated on gelatin (0.5%)- or fibronectin (5 μg/ml)-coated wells (Evergreen Scientific, Los Angeles, CA) in M199 medium with 1% fetal calf serum. After 30 min (or as indicated), cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS and immediately lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin. Cleared extracts were mixed with 20 μg of GST·PAK in the presence of glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). After 1 h incubation at 4 °C, beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times in lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to Rac. Total Rac was determined in cell lysate. The ECL system was used for detection (Amersham Biosciences). HUVEC were plated on fibronectin or gelatin-coated wells (Evergreen Scientific) for 45 min. HUVEC were washed twice in PBS, and cellular cAMP was extracted with 0.1 m HCl and quantified using an enzyme immunoassay (Biomol) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Values were normalized to the protein concentration using a Bio-Rad protein assay and expressed as fmol/μg protein. HUVEC were plated in a serum-free medium in gelatin or fibronectin-coated wells (Evergreen Scientific). At the indicated time, cells were washed once in cold PBS and lysed with cold hypotonic extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). PKA activity was determined by the incorporation of phosphate in Leu-Arg-Arg-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) using the non radioactive Peptag system (Promega, Madison, WI). PKA activity was normalized to protein concentration and expressed as picomoles of incorporated phosphate per minute per microgram of protein. Total RNA was prepared from HUVEC using the RNeasy system (Qiagen, Basel, Switzerland). 2 μg of total RNA were reversed transcribed (Superscript II, Invitrogen), and cDNA was subjected to PCR amplifications using primer pairs specific for E-prostanoid (EP) subtypes EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 cDNAs as described by Sheng et al. (27Sheng H. Shao J. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). PCR primer sequences were as follows: EP1F, 5′-ACCGACCTGGCGGGCCACCTGA-3′; EP1R, 5′-CGCTGAGCGTGTTGCACACCAG-3′; EP2F, 5′-TCCAATGACTCCCAGTCTGAGG-3′; EP2R, 5′-TGCATAGATGACAGGCAGCACG-3′; EP3F, 5′-GATCACCATGCTGCTCACTG-3′; EP3R, 5′-AGTTATGCGAAGAGCTAGTCC-3′; EP4F: 5′-GGGCTGGCTGTCACCGACCTG-3′; and EP4R, 5′-GGTGCGGCGCATGAACTGGCG-3′ (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). Amplification conditions were 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 62 °C and 1 min at 72 °C. We have previously reported that NSAIDs suppressed αVβ3-dependent endothelial cell spreading and migration and that this effect was prevented by exogenous addition of prostaglandins (i.e. PGE2 or PGI2). These results identified COX-2 and derived prostaglandins as critical regulators of vascular integrin αVβ3 function (26Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of prostaglandins in the regulation of αVβ3 function in greater detail, we first characterized the effects of PGE2 and TXA2, two prostanoids implicated in the modulation of angiogenesis (28Daniel T.O. Liu H. Morrow J.D. Crews B.C. Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4574-4577PubMed Google Scholar, 29Form D.M. Auerbach R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1983; 172: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), on the integrin-mediated adhesion and spreading kinetics of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. HUVEC attach on gelatin and vitronectin through integrin αVβ3, whereas they predominantly use integrin α5β1 to attach to fibronectin (15Ruegg C. Yilmaz A. Bieler G. Bamat J. Chaubert P. Lejeune F.J. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). On vitronectin and gelatin, half-maximal and maximal adhesion and spreading were observed at 30–45 and 60 min after plating, respectively (Figs. 1 A and 2,top and middle panels). On fibronectin, adhesion and spreading proceeded with a faster kinetics: half-maximal and maximal levels were observed at 15 and 30 min after plating, respectively (Figs. 1 A and 2, bottom panels). The addition of PGE2 during adhesion on vitronectin or gelatin accelerated HUVEC cell attachment in a dose-dependent manner to reach a kinetics similar to adhesion on fibronectin (Fig. 1 A, top and middle panels). Sixty minutes after plating, maximal adhesion was observed on both substrates regardless of the presence or absence of PGE2. The acceleration of HUVEC adhesion on gelatin and vitronectin induced by PGE2 was paralleled by an acceleration in the spreading kinetics (Fig. 2). HUVEC spreading on fibronectin was not further accelerated by PGE2. The TXA2 analogue U46619 caused a mild but consistent retardation of HUVEC adhesion and the inhibition of spreading on vitronectin and gelatin, resulting in a ∼30% suppression of cell adhesion and an 80% inhibition of spreading at 60 min at a dose of 50 μm(Figs. 1 B and 2). U46619 had no effect on HUVEC adhesion or spreading to fibronectin (Figs. 1 B and 2).Figure 2PGE2 promotes and U46691suppresses αVβ3-mediated cell spreading. HUVEC were plated on vitronectin, gelatin, or fibronectin in the absence or presence of PGE2 (100 ng/ml) or U46619 (50 μm), as indicated. Attached cells were fixed at 15, 30, 45, and 60 min after plating and stained by crystal violet. Results represent the percentage of spread cells over total adherent cells in three high power fields ± S.D. (n = 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From these results we concluded that PGE2 accelerated the initial αVβ3-dependent HUVEC adhesion and spreading kinetics on gelatin and vitronectin, whereasU46619 delayed adhesion and suppressed spreading. α5β1-mediated HUVEC adhesion and spreading on fibronectin were not affected. PGE2 binds to and activates the following four different E-prostanoid receptor subtypes: EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4(30Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To determine which EP receptor was involved in mediating the PGE2 effect, we first determined the EP receptor subtype mRNA expression by reverse transcription PCR. Amplification products for EP2 and EP4, but not EP1 and EP3, were obtained (Fig.3 A). To demonstrate the functionality of EP2 and EP4 receptors, we performed adhesion assays in the absence or presence of butaprost, a selective EP2 receptor agonist, and PGE1alcohol, a selective EP4 receptor agonist. Both agonists accelerated HUVEC adhesion to gelatin with similar kinetics as observed for PGE2 (Fig. 3 B), although they had no effect on HUVEC adhesion to fibronectin (data not shown). The EP3agonist sulprostone had no effect (data not shown). Taken together, these results identify EP2 and EP4 prostanoid receptors as functional PGE2 receptors on HUVEC. PGE2 and TXA2 exert many of their biological effects through G-protein-dependent adenylcyclase (AC) (31Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the PGE2 andU46619 effects on αVβ3-mediated HUVEC adhesion involved modulation of cAMP levels, we measured cAMP concentrations in HUVEC in response to adhesion to gelatin or fibronectin. Adhesion on gelatin caused a transient 2-fold rise in cAMP levels (Fig. 4 A,left panel), whereas adhesion on fibronectin caused a transient, 4-fold rise that was more prolonged compared with the one on gelatin (Fig. 4 A, right panel). Peak cAMP concentrations were reached 15 min after plating on both substrates and returned to pre-adhesion levels within 30 min on gelatin and within 60 min on fibronectin. Adhesion in the presence of U46619 completely prevented the rise in cAMP level on gelatin, but only marginally suppressed the cAMP increase on fibronectin (Fig. 4 A). HUVEC adhesion on gelatin or fibronectin in the presence of exogenous PGE2 resulted in identical maximal cAMP levels and kinetics (Fig. 4 A). The increase in cAMP levels observed in response to HUVEC adhesion to gelatin was completely abolished by NS-398, and this effect was reversed by the addition of exogenous PGE2, whereas the rise in cAMP induced by adhesion to fibronectin was insensitive to NS-398 treatment (Fig. 4 B). To collect direct evidence for a role of cAMP in accelerating αVβ3-dependent adhesion and promoting spreading, we plated HUVEC on gelatin in the absence or presence of the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-brcAMP and NS-398 orU46619. 8-brcAMP accelerated HUVEC adhesion, and this effect was insensitive to NS-398 or U46619 (Fig. 4 C). NS-398 slightly delayed the initial kinetics of attachment and, after 1 h of incubation, control and NS-398-treated HUVEC attached to identical extents. The addition of 8-brcAMP induced strong HUVEC spreading in the presence of NS-398 or U46619 (Fig. 4 D). Similar results were obtained by elevating cAMP levels with forskolin (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that αVβ3-mediated HUVEC adhesion results in a transient and COX-2-dependent increase in cAMP levels, whereas α5β1-mediated adhesion induces a robust and COX-2 independent cAMP rise. Exogenous addition of 8-brcAMP also accelerates αVβ3-dependent HUVEC adhesion in the presence of a COX-2 inhibitor. The small GTP-binding protein Rac is a critical regulator of cell spreading (32Ridley A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 471-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). COX-2 activity and prostaglandin production are essential for αVβ3-dependent Rac activation in HUVEC (26Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In light of the ability of 8-brcAMP to promote cell spreading in the presence of NS-398, we asked the question of whether 8-brcAMP was able to reverse the inhibition of αVβ3-mediated Rac activation caused by NS-398. First, we analyzed the activation kinetics of Rac in HUVEC plated on gelatin and fibronectin using a PAK pull-down assay. HUVEC adhesion on gelatin and fibronectin resulted in rapid activation of Rac with peak activities at 15 and 30 min, respectively (Fig.5 A). Next, we measured Rac activity in HUVEC at 30 min after plating on gelatin in the absence or presence of NS-398, 8-brcAMP, or a combination thereof. The addition of NS-398 during adhesion completely inhibited Rac activation, and this effect was nearly completely reversed by the concomitant addition of 8-brcAMP (Fig. 5 B). The addition of 8-brcAMP during adhesion resulted in a slight increase in Rac activity compared with adhesion on gelatin alone. Next, we asked the question of whether Rac activation was involved in mediating both the acceleration of αVβ3-dependent HUVEC adhesion and HUVEC spreading in response to 8-brcAMP. To address these questions we electroporated HUVEC with an expression vector encoding for a constitutive active (L61Rac) or a dominant negative form (N17Rac) of Rac (26Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and then tested the adhesive and spreading properties of these cells. L61Rac did not accelerate HUVEC adhesion to gelatin, and N17Rac did not delay it. Also, N17 Rac did not prevent the acceleration of HUVEC adhesion induced by 8-brcAMP, and L61Rac did not prevent the adhesion delay caused by U46691 (Fig. 5 C). In contrast, L61Rac fully reversed the inhibition of HUVEC spreading caused by NS-398 and U46691, whereas N17Rac suppressed HUVEC spreading, and this effect was not reversed by 8-brcAMP (Fig. 5 D). From these results we concluded that αVβ3-dependent HUVEC spreading in response to cAMP elevation requires Rac activation, whereas cAMP-induced acceleration of αVβ3-dependent HUVEC adhesion does not. Protein kinase A was reported to regulate αVβ3-dependent angiogenesis (33Kim S. Harris M. Varner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and Rac-dependent migration of carcinoma cells (34O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47895-47900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Because elevated cAMP levels promote PKA activation, we next tested whether HUVEC adhesion to gelatin or fibronectin promoted PKA activation. A basal PKA activity was observed at the time of plating, and adhesion on gelatin induced a transient increase in PKA activity (Fig. 6 A). NS-398 strongly suppressed adhesion-induced PKA activation but did not inhibit basal PKA activity, whereas the pharmacological PKA inhibitor H-89 fully suppressed both basal and adhesion-induced PKA activity (Fig.6 A). PGE2 induced a robust PKA activation even in the presence of NS-398 (Fig. 6 A). HUVEC adhesion to fibronectin induced a strong increase in PKA activity, which was completely insensitive to NS-398 (Fig. 6 B). To test whether PKA activity was required for αVβ3- and α5β1-dependent HUVEC adhesion and spreading, we plated cells on gelatin and fibronectin in the absence or presence of H-89. H-89 strongly suppressed HUVEC adhesion to gelatin, whereas it had no effect on HUVEC adhesion on fibronectin (Fig. 6, C and D). Furthermore, the addition of 8-brcAMP did not reverse H-89-induced inhibition of cell adhesion on gelatin (Fig. 5 C). In PAK pull-down assays we investigated the requirement of PKA in αVβ3- and α5β1-dependent Rac activation. H-89 completely suppressed αVβ3-dependent Rac activation, whereas it did not affect α5β1-mediated Rac activation (Fig. 6 E). The addition of PGE2 or 8-brcAMP did not rescue inhibition of αVβ3-dependent Rac activation caused by H-89 (Fig. 6 E). We next tested whether constitutively active Rac could rescue the suppression of αVβ3-dependent HUVEC adhesion caused by H-89. The result of this experiment demonstrated that expression of L61Rac was not sufficient to rescue suppression of αVβ3-dependent HUVEC adhesion caused by H-89. HUVEC plated on fibronectin in the presence of H-89 spread normally (Fig. 6 G), consistent with the full activation of Rac in the presence of H-89 observed during HUVEC adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 6 E, right panel). From these experiments, we concluded that PKA activity mediates basal and PGE2/8-brcAMP-stimulated αVβ3-dependent HUVEC adhesion and Rac activation and that active Rac does not reconstitute cell adhesion in the absence of PKA activity. In contrast, PKA is not required for α5β1-dependent cell adhesion and spreading. COX-2 expression in tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment promotes tumor progression, and this effect involves the induction of tumor angiogenesis. Mice lacking COX-2 have deficient VEGF expression, reduced tumor angiogenesis, and suppressed tumor growth (35Williams C.S. Tsujii M. Reese J. Dey S.K. DuBois R.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). COX-2 inhibitors decrease VEGF production in fibroblasts and tumor cells and prevent mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to VEGF (23Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M.

Pharmacological inhibition of COX-2 in endothelial cells blocks αVβ3-mediated Rac activation, resulting in reduced cell spreading and migration in vitro and suppressed angiogenesisin vivo (26Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Two of the major COX-2-derived prostanoids, PGE2 and TXA2, have been shown to promote angiogenesis (28Daniel T.O. Liu H. Morrow J.D. Crews B.C. Marnett L.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4574-4577PubMed Google Scholar,29Form D.M. Auerbach R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1983; 172: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), but the mechanisms involved are only partially characterized. In this study we have investigated the effect of PGE2 and TXA2 on αVβ3- and α5β1-mediated HUVEC adhesion and spreading. Here we report the following. First, PGE2 accelerated HUVEC adhesion, induced Rac-activation, and stimulated Rac-dependent spreading mediated by integrin αVβ3, whereas the TXA2 agonist U46691delayed adhesion and inhibited spreading mediated by αVβ3. PGE2 signaled to HUVEC through EP receptors 2 and 4. Second, αVβ3-mediated HUVEC adhesion resulted in a COX-2/PGE2-dependent transient rise in cAMP concentration and activation of the cAMP-dependent PKA. Third, αVβ3-mediated HUVEC adhesion required PKA but not Rac activity, whereas αVβ3-mediated spreading required both PKA and Rac activities. Fourth, integrin α5β1-dependent HUVEC adhesion and Rac activation and spreading were not regulated by COX-2/PGE2 or TXA2 and did not depend on PKA activity. Taken together, these observations demonstrate that αVβ3-dependent HUVEC adhesion and Rac-dependent spreading are positively regulated by COX-2-derived PGE2 through cAMP/PKA-dependent signaling, whereas α5β1-mediated adhesion and spreading occur independently of this pathway. There is increasing evidence indicating that cAMP levels can be regulated by integrin ligation and, on the other hand, that cAMP contributes to the modulation of integrin function. For example, activating anti-β1 integrin antibodies induces MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell migration by stimulating a rise in intracellular cAMP concentration (36Plopper G.E. Huff J.L. Rust W.L. Schwartz M.A. Quaranta V. Mol. Cell. Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which integrin ligation leads to an increase in cAMP level is not completely known. Our results suggest the existence of two distinct and integrin-specific mechanisms. The first one involves αVβ3-mediated and COX-2-dependent production of PGE2, the stimulation of EP2/EP4 receptors, and the activation of AC. This pathway is consistent with the requirement of COX-2 activity to induce a cAMP rise in response to αVβ3 ligation (Fig. 4 A), cell spreading (Fig. 4 D), and migration (26Dormond O. Foletti A. Paroz C. Ruegg C. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1041-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) with the classical signaling pathway of prostaglandins (20Gupta R.A. DuBois R.N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). The stimulation of COX-2-dependent PGE2 production upon αVβ3-dependent adhesion could result from the αVβ3-mediated activation of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and the production of arachidonic acid, the substrate of COX. In this respect, it has been recently reported that αVβ3 ligation induces membrane translocation and activation of PLA2 with the subsequent release of arachidonic acid in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (37Bhattacharya S. Patel R. Sen N. Quadri S. Parthasarathi K. Bhattacharya J. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L1049-L1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PLA2 appears to be stimulated by integrin ligation in several cell types, and in some cases its activation has been linked to the production of arachidonic acid, the activation of PKC, and cell spreading (38Auer K.L. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Clark E.A. Hynes R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14814-14818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The second mechanism involves α5β1-mediated, COX-2/PGE2-independent activation of AC. This is supported by the observation that NS-398 does not inhibit the increase in cAMP concentration observed in HUVEC plated on fibronectin (Fig.4 B). β1 integrin ligation with the RGD cell binding sequence of fibronectin or with β1-activating antibodies followed by mechanical stress has been reported to cause a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP levels and PKA activity in endothelial cells (40Meyer C.J. Alenghat F.J. Rim P. Fong J.H. Fabry B. Ingber D.E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). G-protein α subunit inhibitors suppressed this effect, suggesting that integrin ligation and mechanical stress may stimulate AC through the activation of integrin-coupled heterotrimeric G-proteins (40Meyer C.J. Alenghat F.J. Rim P. Fong J.H. Fabry B. Ingber D.E. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 666-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). cAMP modulates integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration, but, depending on the cell type and context, it can exert stimulatory or inhibitory effects. For example, an increase in cAMP levels was shown to promote adhesion of immature thymocytes to fibronectin (41Halvorson M.J. Coligan J.E. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4567-4574PubMed Google Scholar), to inhibit adhesion of mature T lymphocytes to fibronectin (42Shimizu Y. van Seventer G.A. Ennis E. Newman W. Horgan K.J. Shaw S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 577-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), and to suppresses leukocyte adhesion and migration in response to chemoattractants (43Laudanna C. Campbell J.J. Butcher E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24141-24144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that, in endothelial cells, an elevation of cAMP accelerates αVβ3-mediated adhesion and promotes Rac-dependent spreading via activation of PKA. Recently, cAMP-dependent PKA activation was reported to induce β1-integrin mediated MDA-435 breast carcinoma cell migration in response to growth factors through the activation of Rac and the inhibition of RhoA (34O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47895-47900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). There is also emerging evidence that PKA can positively and negatively regulate integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration of carcinoma and sarcoma-derived cell lines, endothelial cells, and neutrophils (33Kim S. Harris M. Varner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 34O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol.

Metastasis. 1996; 14: 314-322PubMed Google Scholar, 46Jones S.L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 71: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms by which PKA regulates integrin-dependent events and Rac activity in particular remain, however, largely unknown. Taken together, we propose the following working model for the regulation of αVβ3-mediated endothelial cell adhesion and spreading by PGE2. Upon αVβ3-dependent adhesion there is a transient rise in cAMP levels and PKA activity dependent on COX-2-mediated production of PGE2 and on signaling through EP2/EP4 receptors. Increased PKA activity accelerates αVβ3-dependent adhesion through a Rac-independent mechanism and stimulates αVβ3-dependent spreading through a Rac-dependent mechanism. In contrast, the rise in cAMP levels and PKA activity observed after α5β1-mediated adhesion does not depend on COX-2 or PGE2 and is not required for α5β1-dependent HUVEC adhesion and spreading. This latter observation suggests that the ligation of integrin α5β1 may generate a cAMP rise and PKA activation, which can then promote αVβ3-dependent endothelial cell adhesion and spreading/migration. Such a “cross-talk” is consistent with a recent report demonstrating that ligation of integrin α5β1 stimulated αVβ3-dependent endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (33Kim S. Harris M. Varner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33920-33928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Optimal migration and angiogenesis is likely to require intermediate cAMP levels and PKA activity, whereas subthreshold or excessive PKA activity would result in static adhesion. The regulation of cAMP levels may occur through modulation of cAMP generation by AC or degradation by phosphodiesterase. Indeed, growth factor-stimulated carcinoma cell migration was shown to require both cAMP-dependent PKA activity and phosphodiesterase-mediated cAMP degradation (12O'Connor K.L. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1749-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 34O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47895-47900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a PGE2-mediated rise in cAMP promotes αVβ3-mediated endothelial cell adhesion through the activation of PKA and induces spreading via PKA-dependent Rac activation. These results may contribute to the further understanding of the regulation of vascular integrins αVβ3 by COX-2/PGE2 during tumor angiogenesis and inflammation. The authors thank Dr. F. J.

We show that recombinant human PEDF formed complexes with collagens from the bovine cornea and vitreous. We have examined the direct binding of PEDF to collagen I and found that interactions were ionic in nature and occurred when PEDF and collagen I were both in solution, when either one was immobilized, or even when collagen I was denatured under reducing conditions. 125I-PEDF bound to immobilized collagen I in a saturable fashion (K D = 123 nm). Compared with neurotrophic PEDF-derived peptides, ovalbumin and angiogenic inhibitors, only full-length PEDF competed efficiently with 125I-PEDF for the binding to immobilized collagen I (EC50 = 3 μg/ml). The collagen-binding region was analyzed using controlled proteolysis and chemically modified PEDF. Cleavage of the serpin exposed loop did not prevent binding to collagen I. Conjugation of lysines with fluorescein increased the collagen binding affinity. However, treatment of PEDF with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide abolished it, implicating the PEDF aspartic and/or glutamic acid residues in its interaction with collagen I. A negatively charged region on the surface of the PEDF molecule is rich in acidic residues (Glu41, Glu42, Glu43, Asp44, Asp64, Asp256, Asp258, Glu290, Glu291, Glu296, Asp300, Glu304) available to interact directly with positively charged areas of collagen. This represents the first collagen-binding site described for a serpin, which in PEDF, is distinct from its heparin-binding region, neurotrophic active site, and its serpin exposed loop.

Several reports show that PEDF is a major inhibitor of neovascularization and is responsible for excluding vessels from invading the cornea, vitreous, and retina (6Bouck N. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 330-334Google Scholar, 7Dawson D.W. Volpert O.V. Gillis P. Crawford S.E. Xu H. Benedict W. Bouck N.P. Science. 1999; 285: 245-248Google Scholar, 8Stellmach V. Crawford S.E. Zhou W.

PEDF is highly secreted by a variety of cells and associates intimately with extracellular matrix (5Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Ranalli M. Huang X. Huang L. Volpert O. De Vries G.H. Abramson L.P.

In particular, cells of the retinal pigment epithelium secrete PEDF protein, which associates with the interphotoreceptor matrix consistent with its affinity for binding glycosaminoglycans, e.g. heparin and heparan sulfate (13Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Google Scholar,14Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Google Scholar). Other areas in the eye that contain PEDF include the vitreous gel and the cornea. In the bovine vitreous, PEDF accumulates at 20 nm accounting for <1% of the total protein of cell-free extracts (15Wu Y.Q. Becerra S.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1984-1993Google Scholar). In the human cornea, PEDF immunolabeling has been detected in the epithelium and endothelium (16Karakousis P.C. John S.K. Behling K.C. Surace E.M. Smith J.E. Hendrickson A. Tang W.X. Bennett J. Milam A.H. Mol. Vis. 2001; 7: 154-163Google Scholar). Outside of the eye, PEDF has been detected in teeth, bone, and cartilage matrix (10Kozaki K. Miyaishi O. Koiwai O. Yasui Y. Kashiwai A. Nishikawa Y. Shimizu S. Saga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15125-15130Google Scholar). It is worth noting that in addition to containing PEDF and being rich in collagen, the adult vitreous, cornea, and bone and cartilage matrixes are vessel-free. Collagens comprise a family of 19 proteins with a broad range of structural and physiological functions, which are strictly located in the extracellular space. They are composed of three chains that fold to form at least one triple helical domain. All collagens are present in tissues as homotrimeric and/or heterotrimeric assemblies and have specific tissue distributions and functions, e.g. they are involved in hemostasis, wound healing, cell adhesion, and migration. In the cornea and vitreous they are known to give transparency, strength, and elasticity. Collagen type I is the major protein of the cornea (94% of the total collagen in the bovine cornea) and coassembles in heterotypic fibrils with collagen type V. Collagen type II is the main protein of the vitreous (70–80%) followed by collagens type V/XI and IX (17Bishop P.N. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2000; 19: 323-344Google Scholar). Studies on structure-function relationships have revealed that PEDF is a glycoprotein of 50 kDa that folds like members of the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors (serpins) (13Wu Y.Q. Notario V. Chader G.J. Becerra S.P. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 447-456Google Scholar, 18Steele F.R. Chader G.J. Johnson L.V. Tombran-Tink J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25992-25999Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of action are better understood for its neurotrophic activities than for its antiangiogenic properties. Upon interactions with receptors on the surface of cells, PEDF can activate the necessary signal transduction events for neurotrophic activities (20Alberdi E. Aymerich M.S. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31605-31612Google Scholar, 21Aymerich M.S. Alberdi E.M. Martinez A. Becerra S.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3287-3293Google Scholar, 22Yabe T. Wilson D. Schwartz J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43313-43319Google Scholar). The binding sites for receptors are distinct and non-overlapping from those for glycosaminoglycans, with affinities for PEDF >1000-fold different (K D ∼3 nmfor the receptor; K D ∼4 μm for heparin) and locations in the folded PEDF protein molecule separated about 180° (12Stratikos E. Alberdi E. Gettins P.G. Becerra S.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Google Scholar, 14Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Google Scholar, 20Alberdi E. Aymerich M.S.

The receptors interact with a neurotrophic region spanning amino acid positions 78–121 in the human PEDF (termed 44-mer), while heparin binds to a region rich in basic amino acids (lysines and arginines) located opposite to the 44-mer. Both of these binding sites are distinct and away from the homologous serpin reactive loop. Given the antiangiogenic activities of PEDF and colocalization with collagen in extracellular matrix, it was of interest to study the binding between these two proteins for structure-function studies. We have examined the interactions of PEDF with collagens present in bovine eyes and developed assays for PEDF-collagen binding. Using recombinant human PEDF polypeptides, synthetic PEDF peptides, and three different chemically modified PEDF versions, we have analyzed the binding site of PEDF to collagen I. We discuss how these data may aid in further understanding the antiangiogenic functions of PEDF. PEDF was purified from the culturing media of baby hamster kidney cells containing an expression vector for human PEDF as described (12Stratikos E. Alberdi E. Gettins P.G. Becerra S.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2575-2582Google Scholar). 125I-PEDF and Fl-PEDF were prepared as described previously (14Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Google Scholar, 21Aymerich M.S. Alberdi E.M. Martinez A. Becerra S.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3287-3293Google Scholar). Collagen type I purified from rat tail, collagen type III from human placenta, and 24-well plates coated with collagen I were all purchased from BD Biosciences. Collagen type II purified from chicken sternal cartilage, monoclonal antibodies to bovine skin collagen type I (mouse IgG1 isotype, clone COL-1), pig collagen type II (mouse IgM isotype, COL-2) and human collagen type III (mouse IgG1 isotype, FH-7A), and heparin immobilized on acrylic beads were obtained from Sigma. The monoclonal antibody to PEDF, anti-PEDF, was obtained from Chemicon. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum to fluorescein (IgG fraction), anti-Fl, was from Molecular Probes. Protease inhibitor tablets and Lumi-LightPLUS Western blotting kit were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Vectastin ABC elite kit for immunoreactions was obtained from Vector Laboratories. Centricon-100 and centricon-30 devices were obtained from Millipore. PBS was prepared from 10× phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, from Invitrogen (catalog number 70011-044). 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbomiide HCl (EDC) and BupH MES-buffered saline were from Pierce. Ethylenediamine was from Acros, and ethanolamine was from J. T. Baker Inc. Bovine eyes were purchased from J. W. Trueth & Sons, Baltimore, MD. After dissection of the eye, the corneas were removed, suspended in a solution of cold 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA containing protease inhibitors at 10 ml per cornea, and homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkmann PT 3000) set at 10,000 rpm for 20 s. The homogenized material was separated from tissue and cellular debris by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 80,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant termed corneal extract was stored at −80 °C until use and contained ∼1.7 mg/ml protein. Vitreous extracts were obtained as described before (15Wu Y.Q. Becerra S.P. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 1984-1993Google Scholar). Briefly, after dissection of the anterior of the eye, the vitreous gel was transferred to a tube, homogenized with a Polytron, and subjected to centrifugation at 1300 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant termed vitreal extract was stored at −80 °C until use and contained ∼0.4 mg/ml protein. These assays were based on the separation of complexes formed between PEDF and other proteins by ultrafiltration in which PEDF complexes >100-kDa are retained by a membrane of M r 100,000 exclusion limit, while free PEDF molecules of 50 kDa are filtered through (14Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Google Scholar). PEDF proteins (100 μg/ml, unless indicated) were mixed with either ocular extracts or collagen (100 μg/ml, unless indicated) in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Because stock solutions of collagen II and III contained 10 mm acetic acid, NaOH was added to neutralize the pH of the reaction mixtures. PEDF complexes were separated from free PEDF with Centricon-100 devices centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 40 min followed by three washes with 10% glycerol/PBS. The retained material was resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coommassie Blue staining or immunostaining as described below. To quantify the binding, the intensity of PEDF bands was quantified using NIH Image. The binding data were analyzed using Prism GraphPad software. PEDF affinity resin was prepared as described previously (20Alberdi E. Aymerich M.S. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31605-31612Google Scholar). A total of 50 μl of PEDF affinity beads and 100 μg/ml protein from each of collagen I, corneal, and vitreal extracts was mixed in an 1.5-ml tube with gentle rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. Bound and unbound material was separated by centrifugation at 1600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 300 μl of 10% glycerol/PBS. SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 μl) was added to the beads, mixed, heated at 100 °C, centrifuged, and the supernatant was resolved by SDS-PAGE. Protein samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were washed with 1% Nonidet P-40 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) for 15 min at room temperature with gentle rocking and washed twice with TBS for 10 min. The membranes were blocked with Blocking Solution (Lumi-LightPLUS kit) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking before incubation with 2 nm Fl-PEDF in Blocking Solution for 2 h at room temperature with gentle rocking. The membranes were rinsed and washed four times for 2 min each with TBST (TBS with 0.05% Tween 20). Bound Fl-PEDF was detected by immunostaining with anti-fluorescein as described below for Western blot with Lumi-lightPLUS. Binding reactions were performed with 125I-PEDF (2 nm, unless indicated) in 0.1% BSA/PBS, pH 7.4, to collagen I immobilized on plastic of 24-well plates. After incubations at 4 °C for 90 min with gentle rocking, the binding solution was removed, and the wells were washed three times with 0.1% BSA/PBS. Then 1 n NaOH was added to the wells, incubated at room temperature for 30 min, and transferred to scintillation vials to determine the amount of radioactivity using a β-scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was determined from fractions with >100-fold molar excess of unlabeled PEDF over radioligand. Binding data were analyzed by non-linear regression using Prism GraphPad software. Assays for PEDF-collagen I interactions were performed immobilizing either 4 ng of collagen I or PEDF on a CM5 sensor chip, by N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)/EDC activation, followed by covalent amine coupling of the proteins to the surface using Biacore 3000. In particular we treated the carboxymethyl-dextran surface of the sensor chip with NHS/EDC to activate it in preparation for amine coupling. The NHS/EDC creates reactive ester groups where the carboxyl groups were on the dextran (only about 40% of the COO− groups are derivitized). The protein designed to be bound to the activated CM5 chip is exposed to the dextran with the reactive esters. Primary amines on the protein (e.g. N-terminal and possibly lysine groups) then attach to the dextran by nucleophilic substitution of the reactive ester. The remaining free surface (about 60%) was then blocked with 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0, and the matrix washed with 0.5m NaCl solution and then re-equilibrated with binding buffer (PBS, 10% glycerol). Eight different dilutions of PEDF or collagen I were prepared in binding buffer with concentrations ranging from 0 to 1.0 μm and injected from low to high concentration, and then the series was repeated, to study the interaction of both free PEDF on a collagen I matrix and the inverse orientation. Each injection was followed by a 0.5 m NaCl regeneration step. The data were then fitted to several binding models for a kinetic analysis. The best fittings were obtained with a simple 1:1 Langmuir model for the collagen surface binding assay and with a bivalent analyte model for the opposite orientation. Purified PEDF (2.25 mg/ml; 45 μm) was mixed with 6 mm ethylenediamine or 12 mm ethanolamine and increasing concentrations of EDC (as indicated) in 0.1 MES, 0.9% NaCl, pH 4.7. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. To purify the conjugates, 2 ml of PBS were added to the mixtures and then subjected to ultrafiltration through centricon-30 (M r cut-off = 30,000). This was repeated four times. The protein concentration in the final samples ranged between 0.5–0.8 mg/ml. EDC-treated PEDF was subjected to heparin affinity column chromatography (14Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10643-10652Google Scholar). EDC-treated PEDF (20 μg) was diluted in a 0.6-ml total volume of buffer S (20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, 20 mm NaCl) and loaded onto a column of heparin immobilized on acrylic beads (0.5 ml bed volume). The flow-through was collected and the column washed with 10 column volumes of buffer S. The bound protein was eluted with a step gradient of NaCl in buffer S (0.6 ml per fraction). The flow-through and eluted fractions were concentrated using Centricon-30 before SDS-PAGE. Limited proteolysis of PEDF and Fl-PEDF was with chymotrypsin at a protease:substrate ratio of 1:100 (w:w) as described previously (19Becerra S.P. Sagasti A. Spinella P. Notario V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25992-25999Google Scholar). Cleavage of the serpin exposed loop was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. PAGE was performed using premade 10–20% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) with Tricine-SDS running buffer following the manufacturer's instructions followed by either Coomassie Blue staining or Western analysis. Proteins in gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (pore size of 20 μm). Immunostaining of PEDF and fluorescein was by ECL using Lumi-LightPLUS following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the membranes were sequentially incubated in a 1:100,000 dilution of mouse anti-PEDF or 1:200,000 dilution of rabbit anti-Fl in Blocking Solution, then in secondary antibody (anti-mouse IgG-POD (1:1,000) or anti-rabbit IgG-POD (1:20,000)) and finally in Lumi-LightPLUS substrate solution and then exposed to Kodak Biomax ML film. For colorimetric immunostaining, the membranes were sequentially incubated in a 1:750 dilution of anti-collagen I or anti-collagen III, then in biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (1:1000) and followed by ABC solution (Vectastin ABC elite kit). Color was developed with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) color development reagent (Bio-Rad). Because PEDF is a natural component of cornea and vitreous, we evaluated its ability to interact with proteins from these ocular components. Binding reactions were performed at 4 °C to allow interactions to occur with minimal proteolytic degradation. Using a method based on size-exclusion ultrafiltration, a PEDF of 50 kDa was retained by the membrane (exclusion limit of M r 100,000) only when incubated with the ocular extracts (Fig.1 A). The amount of bound PEDF increased with increasing amounts of corneal and vitreal protein in the reactions. Next, we used ligand affinity chromatography to identify PEDF-binding proteins in the cornea and vitreous. Several proteins of the cornea and vitreous had binding affinity for immobilized PEDF, including proteins that comigrated with collagen I and immunoreacted with antibodies to collagens (Fig. 1 B). Note that the commercial collagen I also bound to the PEDF affinity resin. Ligand blotting of collagen I showed that PEDF bound to immobilized denatured collagen I and comigrating proteins from vitreous and cornea after SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 C). These data demonstrated that PEDF can bind to bovine corneal and vitreal collagens in solution and when immobilized. Then we assayed the binding of PEDF to purified collagen types I and II in solution. Fig.2 shows that PEDF bound to each type of collagen, unlike the non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin. The binding was collagen concentration-dependent with an apparent efficiency greater for collagen type I than the other types (Fig.2 B). Non-linear regression analyses of PEDF binding with increasing concentrations of collagen I and II showed a best fitted equation for a sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) with half-maximal concentration binding EC50= 11.9 μg/ml collagen I, Hill coefficient = 4.342 and EC50= 117.5 μg/ml collagen II, Hill coefficient = 2.423, implying a cooperative behavior for the PEDF-collagen interactions. The binding between PEDF and collagens occurred at physiological conditions of 150 mm NaCl and pH 7.4 and at a similar extent with incubations between 0 and 25 °C. 2C. Meyer, personal observations.However, decreasing the pH of the reaction from 8.2 to 5.0 had an inhibitory effect on the binding with optimum binding at pH 7.4–8.2 (Fig. 2 C). A similar pH effect was observed for collagen III binding (data not shown). Thus PEDF formed specific complexes with collagens in solution, binding most efficiently to type I. Because PEDF had higher affinity for collagen type I compared with the other types, we analyzed these interactions in more detail. PEDF radiolabeled with 125I was used as a ligand for collagen I binding. Solution assays showed that 43% of the 200 nm125I-PEDF was retained by ultrafiltration in reactions with collagen I (20 μg/ml), in contrast to 5% without collagen I, which decreased with an excess of unlabeled PEDF over the radioligand (data not shown). Thus, as with unmodified PEDF, the 125I-PEDF modified on tyrosines by iodination formed specific complexes with collagen I in solution. To determine the binding parameters of the PEDF-collagen I interactions, solid-phase binding assays were performed with soluble radioligand and immobilized collagen I on plastic. The binding reactions were under the same conditions as the solution assays above; however, one advantage was that they could be performed with lower concentrations of radioligand. 125I-PEDF at 2 nm bound to the immobilized collagen I and the unlabeled ligand competed efficiently for the binding with a half-maximal competition concentration of EC50 = 1.69 μg/ml (34 nm PEDF) (Fig.3 A). A binding saturation curve was calculated (Fig. 3 B), and the binding parameters revealed an affinity of K D = 124 nm for the PEDF-collagen I interactions. Radioligand competion assays were performed with PEDF fragments. BH is a bacterially derived recombinant human PEDF fragment spanning amino acid positions 44–418 (23Becerra S.P. Palmer I. Kumar A. Steele F. Shiloach J. Notario V. Chader G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23148-23156Google Scholar), and the 34-mer and 44-mer peptides are synthetic peptides designed from the human PEDF sequence between positions 44–77 and 78–121, respectively. The 44-mer peptide contains the receptor-binding region of PEDF and has neurotrophic activity on retinoblastoma cells (20Alberdi E. Aymerich M.S. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31605-31612Google Scholar). Fig. 3 C shows that additions of an excess of BH inhibited the 125I-PEDF binding, comparable with additions of unlabeled PEDF. The presence of 75 mmurea in the binding reactions decreased the 125I-PEDF binding to 60%, probably due to partial unfolding of the ligand. However the 34-mer and 44-mer peptides did not have a major effect on the binding of PEDF to collagen I. Similarly, increasing concentrations of angiostatin or endostatin, established antiangiogenic inhibitors, did not compete with 125I-PEDF for binding to collagen I. 3S. P. Becerra, unpublished observations. When collagen I in solution was used to test for displacement of bound125I-PEDF from the immobilized collagen I, additions of increasing concentrations of collagen I resulted in a gradual loss in radioligand binding, reaching ∼40% inhibition with 100 μg/ml collagen I (Fig. 3 D). Biacore kinetic and affinity analyses were performed on the interaction between PEDF and collagen I (Table I), and little or no nonspecific binding was observed with this method. Binding was reproducible and yielded data suitable for analysis. When the assay was performed in an orientation where the PEDF monomer protein was in solution (following a simple 1:1 interaction mechanism), the resultant affinities from both steady-state analysis and kinetically derivedK D matched those obtained from solid-phase assays with radioisotopes in solution. When the orientation was reversed, and the trimeric collagen was in solution as the analyte, the kinetics became somewhat complicated probably due to avidity effects of multivalency (e.g. more than one PEDF-binding site on a collagen molecule). This observation was consistent with the cooperative binding found above with collagen in solution (see Fig. 2). Even though the measured affinities fell within a 10-fold range (i.e. 100–800 nm) for the bivalent steady-state model proposed for collagen binding to immobilized PEDF, and were roughly consistent with affinities measured in the opposite orientation (i.e. collagen I surface), the results from the latter orientation (i.e. collagen I surface) and the simple 1:1 model are to be preferred.Table IComparison of methods to measure affinity and kinetics of the PEDF-collagen I interactionsMethodOrientationAffinityKineticsnmRadioisotopeCollagen surface123NAaNA, not available.Biacore kineticsCollagen surface135k a = 2.62e6 m−1 s−1 k d = 0.353 s−1Biacore steady-stateCollagen surface135NABiacore kinetics (bivalent)PEDF surface351k a = 1.65e5 m−1 s−1 k d = 0.06 s−1Biacore steady-statePEDF surface115NABiacore bivalent steady-statePEDF surface826NAa NA, not available. Open table in a new tab To elucidate the type of interactions between PEDF and collagen I, we examined the effect of increasing the ionic strength in the reactions using NaCl. Fig. 4 shows that the binding of both unmodified PEDF and 125I-PEDF to collagen I was lost with an increase in NaCl concentration. The affinity of both PEDF versions for collagen I decreased significantly with 400 mmNaCl and 600 mm NaCl and was completely lost with ≥1m NaCl. These data showed that the binding of PEDF to collagen was sensitive to increasing ionic strength, implying an ionic nature for their interactions, and that the modification on tyrosines by conjugation with 125I did not affect this binding characteristic of PEDF. Given the ionic nature of the PEDF-collagen I interactions, we investigated the role that charges of the protein play on collagen I binding. The three-dimensional structure of PEDF has revealed two distinct areas with opposite ionic potentials on its surface (14Alberdi E. Hyde C.C. Becerra S.P.

In the present study we provide evidence that arsenic trioxide induces activation of the small G-protein Rac1 and the α and β isoforms of the p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in several leukemia cell lines. Such activation of Rac1 and p38-isoforms results in downstream engagement of the MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2 and is enhanced by pre-treatment of cells with ascorbic acid. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of p38 potentiates arsenic-dependent apoptosis and suppression of growth of leukemia cell lines, suggesting that this signaling cascade negatively regulates induction of antileukemic responses by arsenic trioxide. Consistent with this, overexpression of a dominant-negative p38 mutant (p38βAGF) enhances the antiproliferative effects of arsenic trioxide on target cells. To further define the relevance of activation of the Rac1/p38 MAP kinase pathway in the induction of arsenic-dependent antileukemic effects, studies were performed using bone marrows from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Arsenic trioxide suppressed the growth of leukemic myeloid (CFU-GM) progenitors from such patients, whereas concomitant pharmacological inhibition of the p38 pathway enhanced its growth-suppressive effects. Altogether, these data provide evidence for a novel function of the p38 MAP kinase pathway, acting as a negative regulator of arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis and inhibition of malignant cell growth.

Four MAPK family subgroups exist: extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-Jun N-terminal or stress-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5/big mitogen activated protein kinase 1 (BMK1), and the p38 group of protein kinases (reviewed in Ref. 11Ono K.

Bokoch G. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4012-4019Google Scholar) have shown that all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) induces activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway and that pharmacological inhibition of p38 potentiates the antiproliferative and differentiating effects of RA on NB-4 cells (37Alsayed Y. Uddin S. Mahmud N. Lekmine F. Kalvakolanu D.V. Minucci S. Bokoch G. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4012-4019Google Scholar). As arsenic trioxide suppresses the growth of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro, including RA-resistant cells, we performed studies to evaluate the role of the p38 MAP kinase in the induction of arsenic trioxide-dependent cellular responses. Our data demonstrate that p38 is phosphorylated and activated by arsenic trioxide in an early and sustained manner and that this activation is downstream of redox events activated by arsenic trioxide. Furthermore, they establish that the small G-protein Rac1 and the MAPKapK-2 kinase are arsenic-dependent upstream and downstream effectors, respectively, of the p38 MAP kinase. Interestingly, our findings indicate that inhibition of p38 by pharmacological inhibitors, or by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant, enhances arsenic-induced apoptosis. These results strongly suggest that such activation of the p38 MAP kinase signaling cascade provides a negative feedback regulatory mechanism that counteracts the antileukemic effects of arsenic trioxide. In further support of this hypothesis, in experiments in which the effects of pharmacological inhibitors of p38 were directly examined in primary leukemic progenitors from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients, we found that p38 inhibition strongly enhances arsenic-dependent suppression of leukemic precursor cell growth. The NB-4 human acute promyelocytic leukemia, the NB-4.007/6 RA-resistant variant (38Fanelli M. Minucci S. Gelmetti V. Nervi C. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Pelicci G. J. Biol.

The MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cell line and the LNKAP prostate carcinoma cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Arsenic trioxide and ascorbic acid were purchased from Sigma. An antibody against the phosphorylated form of p38 was obtained from New England Biolabs.

Briefly, cells were treated with arsenic trioxide for the indicated times and lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer.

The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. Proteins were subsequently analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated forms of ATF2 or hsp25 were detected by autoradiography. NB-4 cells were pre-treated for 30–60 min with the indicated doses of SB203580 and were subsequently treated with arsenic trioxide for the indicated times, in the continuous presence of the pharmacological inhibitors.

Cell lines were exposed to arsenic trioxide in the presence or absence of SB203580 (10 μm) as indicated. The percentage of apoptotic cells were determined at various time points by flow cytometry after staining with fluorescein-conjugated annexin-V and propidium iodide, as in previous studies (36Verma A.

To create the p38β2AGF mutant, a commercial kit (QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a pair of complementary primers with 30 bases (N terminus, 5′-ACGAGGAGATGGCCGGCTTTGTGGCCACGC-3′; C terminus, 5′-GCGTGGCCACAAAGCCGGCCATCTCCTCGT-3′) was designed, which included the mutation to change threonine (ACC) to alanine (GCC) and tyrosine (TAT) to phenylalanine (TTT). pCDN-p38β2 (provided by Dr. Sanjay Kumar, Smith, Kline Beecham) was amplified using PfuDNA polymerase with these primers for 12 cycles in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After digestion of the parental DNA with DpnI, the amplified DNA incorporated with the nucleotide substitution was transformed into E. coli(DH5α-strain). The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. MCF-7 cells were transfected using the superfect reagent and were subsequently selected in G418 using standard methodologies. We first determined whether As2O3treatment induces phosphorylation/activation of the p38 (also called p38α) MAP kinase in the NB-4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line. NB-4 cells were incubated for 30 or 60 min in the presence or absence of As2O3. The cells were subsequently lysed in phosphorylation lysis buffer, and total lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with an antibody against the phosphorylated/activated form of p38. As2O3treatment induced strong phosphorylation of p38 after either 30 or 60 min of treatment (Fig. 1 A). Such phosphorylation of p38 was detectable when low (0.5 μm) or high (2 μm) doses of As2O3 were used (Fig. 1 A). Stripping and reprobing the blots demonstrated that equal amounts of p38 were detectable prior to and after As2O3 treatment (Fig. 1 B). We subsequently determined whether arsenic-dependent phosphorylation/activation of p38 (p38α) occurs in an NB-4 variant cell line, NB-4.007/6 (38Fanelli M. Minucci S. Gelmetti V. Nervi C. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Pelicci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 93: 1477-1481Google Scholar). This variant form of NB-4 is refractory to all-trans-RA-induced differentiation and inhibition of cell growth, because of constitutive degradation of PML-RAR (38Fanelli M. Minucci S. Gelmetti V. Nervi C. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Pelicci G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 93: 1477-1481Google Scholar), and in our previous studies we have shown that the activation of p38 by all-trans-retinoic acid is defective in these cells (37Alsayed Y. Uddin S. Mahmud N. Lekmine F. Kalvakolanu D.V. Minucci S. Bokoch G. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4012-4019Google Scholar). Treatment of NB-4.007/6 cells with As2O3 resulted in phosphorylation of p38 (Fig.1, C and D), consistent with the fact that these cells are responsive to the growth inhibitory effects of As2O3 (data not shown). Thus, As2O3 induces phosphorylation of p38 in cells that are resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of RA, indicating that the early upstream regulatory signals that mediate As2O3-dependent activation of p38 are different from the ones mediating RA-dependent activation. The activation of p38 by As2O3 in NB-4 cells was sustained and prolonged and could be detected for as long as 5 days of As2O3 treatment of the cells, a time point at which As2O3 induces cell-differentiation (Fig. 1 E). In parallel studies, we examined whether the β-isoform of p38 (p38β) is expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and whether As2O3 induces its activation. NB-4 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of As2O3, and after cell lysis, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a specific anti-p38β antibody. Immune-complex kinase assays were subsequently carried out on the immunoprecipitates, using ATF2 as an exogenous substrate. As shown in Fig.2 B, treatment of the cells with As2O3 resulted in induction of the kinase activity of p38β, evidenced by the phosphorylation of ATF2 used as an exogenous substrate (Fig. 2 A). Thus, in addition to the p38α, the p38β isoform is also activated by As2O3 in the NB-4 acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line, suggesting that it also participates in the induction of As2O3 responses in these cells. Previous studies have established that a downstream effector for p38 is the MAPKapK-2 kinase, which is activated in response to stress signals and growth factors (31Foltz I.N. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Schrader J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3296-3301Google Scholar, 45Freshney N.W. Rawlinson L. Guesdon F. Jones E. Cowley S. Hsuan J. Saklatvala J. Cell. 1994; 78: 1039-1049Google Scholar), as well as in response to interferon-dependent activation of the p38 pathway (33Uddin S. Lekmine F. Sharma N. Majchrzak B. Mayer I. Young P.R. Bokoch G.M. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27634-27640Google Scholar,35Mayer I.A. Verma A. Grumbach I.M. Uddin S. Lekmine F. Ravandi F. Majchrzak B. Fujita S. Fish E.N. Platanias L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28570-28577Google Scholar). We examined whether As2O3-induced activation of p38 leads to downstream engagement and activation of MAPKapK-2 in NB-4 cells. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of As2O3, lysates were immunoprecipitated with an anti-MAPKapK-2 antibody, and immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to in vitrokinase assays using hsp25 as an exogenous substrate. As2O3 treatment of the cells resulted in activation of MAPKapK-2, evidenced by the phosphorylation of hsp25 in the kinase assay (Fig. 2 B). In addition, pre-treatment of cells with the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580 completely abrogated the As2O3-inducible activation of MAPKapK-2 (Fig.2 B), demonstrating that the engagement of MAPKapK-2 in an As2O3-dependent cellular pathway occurs downstream of p38. In addition to its effects against acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, As2O3 has been shown to exhibit pro-apoptotic and growth inhibitory effects in a variety of different tumor cell lines (5Gartenhaus R.B.

Nakagawa Y. Akiyama K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 59-62Google Scholar). To examine whether activation of the p38-pathway by arsenic is limited to cells of promyelocytic origin or also occurs in cells of other malignant phenotypes, the phosphorylation/activation of p38 was examined in several cell lines of diverse origin. The cell lines used included the K562 acute erythroleukemia cell line, which has been derived from a patient with CML in blast crisis and expresses BCR-ABL, the LNKAP prostate carcinoma cell line, and the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line, all of which exhibited sensitivity to the growth inhibitory effects of As2O3 in MTT cell proliferation assays (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3, As2O3 induced strong phosphorylation/activation of p38 in K562 cells (Fig. 3,A and B), LNKAP cells (Fig. 3, C andD), and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3, E and F). Thus, the p38-pathway is activated in an As2O3-dependent manner in a variety of malignant cell phenotypes, indicating that it plays a universal role in the generation of As2O3 responses. It is well established that the activated, GTP-bound form of the small G-protein Rac1 acts as an upstream regulator of the p38 MAP kinase pathway in response to various stimuli (33Uddin S. Lekmine F.

Most p24 proteins form hetero-oligomers, essential for their correct localization and stability. Functional insights regarding the mechanisms of their steady state localization and the role of interaction with coat proteins has been hampered by a lack of data on their concentration and state of oligomerization within the endoplasmic reticulum, the intermediate compartment, and Golgi complex. We have determined for all mammalian p24 family members the size of the oligomers formed and their stoichiometric relation in each of these individual organelles. In contrast to earlier reports, we show that individual members exist as dimers and monomers and that the ratio between these two forms depends on both the organelle investigated and the p24 protein. We find unequal quantities, with p23 and p27 building up concentration gradients, ruling out a simple 1:1 stoichiometry. In addition, we show differential cycling of individual p24 members.

For mammalian p23, it has been proposed that it serves as COPI receptor because it can bind to coat components (1Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y.

In addition, a direct interaction of p24 family members has been shown with proteins involved in vesicle budding and cargo sorting, such as ARF-1 (ADP-ribosylation factor) (10Gommel D.U. Memon A.R.

Therefore, p24 proteins have been implicated to be involved in transport processes of the early secretory pathway, but their precise function is still unclear. All p24 proteins are found in membranes of the early secretory pathway (1Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 537-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another outstanding property of p24 proteins is the formation of hetero-oligomers. As was shown in several immunoprecipitation studies, they interact with each other to a certain extent (3Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 4Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Solari R.C. Rowley A.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1939-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of a single p24 protein leads to a mislocalization of all p24 proteins in ER-derived structures (13Gommel D. Orci L. Emig E.M. Hannah M.J. Ravazzola M. Nickel W. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. Sohn K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Emery G. Rojo M. Grünberg J. J.

Cell. 1999; 10: 1939-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and only the simultaneous overexpression of p24 proteins of all subfamilies results in a convincing perinuclear Golgi localization (15Emery G. Rojo M. Grünberg J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2507-2516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,16Füllekrug J. Suganuma T. Tang B.L. Hong W. Storrie B. Nilsson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1939-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in yeast cells lacking one p24 protein (4Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Solari R.C. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) and in cells from mice lacking one allele of p23 (18Denzel A. Otto F. Girod A. Pepperkok R. Watson R. Rosewell I. Bergeron J.J. Solari R.C. Owen M.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 55-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) other family members are degraded. Thus, there is a strict dependence among p24 proteins in terms of stability, transport, and/or localization. Consequently, the formation of hetero-oligomers seems to be a prerequisite for their correct function. To set a basis for understanding the molecular functionality of p24 proteins, we have undertaken a detailed study of their oligomeric behavior, their stoichiometric relation, and cycling in the membranes of the secretory pathway. We demonstrate that p24 proteins, in contrast to earlier results (1Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Solari R.C. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), exist either as dimers or monomers with no higher oligomers observed. Moreover, we find different ratios between dimers and monomers depending both on a given p24 protein and on its subcellular localization. p23 and p27 build up concentration gradients, and p24 and p25 are distributed equally in the early secretory pathway, with differential cycling between these compartments. Therefore, we assume highly dynamic and complex interactions of these four p24 proteins. In contrast, p26 and tp24 do not seem to interact with the other four members as they occur exclusively either as monomer or as dimer, respectively, and their concentrations are vastly different from other p24 proteins. Antibodies directed against p23, p24, p25, p26, tp24, and p27 were raised in rabbits, chicken, and guinea pigs with the peptides or recombinant proteins indicated in parentheses coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Sigma): Henriette (p23 recombinant luminal domain), HAC344 (p23-tail, CLRRFFKAKKLIE), Thelma (p23, KITDSAGHILYSK), #1327chicken (p23, KITDSAGHILYSK), Elfriede (p24 tail, (13Gommel D.

Immunization and affinity purification was performed according to standard protocols (19Harlowe E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against cytochrome b5 were a kind gift of N. Borgese (University of Milan, Italy), monoclonal antibodies against ERGIC-53 were from H.-P. Hauri (Biocenter, Basel, Switzerland) (20Schweizer A. Fransen J.A. Bachi T. Ginsel L. Hauri H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against p30 (mitochondrial protein) and PMP69 (peroxisomal membrane protein) were provided by W. Just (Biochemie-Zentrum Heidelberg, University of Heidelberg, Germany). Further antibodies used were: anti-protein disulfide isomerase (PDI, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-KDEL-receptor (Stressgen Biotechnologies), anti-transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-rabbit-peroxidase (POD, BioRad Laboratories), anti-mouse-POD (Dianova), anti-guinea pig-POD (Dianova), anti-chicken-POD (Dianova), monoclonal anti-rabbit-POD (Sigma), anti-mouse-Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes), and anti-guinea pig-Alexa-456 (Molecular Probes). HeLa cells (ATTC: CCL-2.2) were grown in Spinner culture according to standard conditions up to 4–6 × 105 cells/ml. Homogenization and centrifugation were performed according to Ref. 16Füllekrug J. Suganuma T. Tang B.L. Hong W. Storrie B. Nilsson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1939-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar. After centrifugation, 18 instead of 9 fractions were taken from the top of the gradient and were diluted 1:1 with buffer and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were used for further analysis. Galactosyltransferase activity was measured according to Ref. 21Brew K. Shaper J.H. Olsen K.W. Trayer I.P. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1434-1444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and alkaline phosphodiesterase corresponding to Ref. 22Warnock D.E. Roberts C. Lutz M.S. Blackburn W.A. Young Jr., W.W.

The content of other marker proteins was determined by Western blot analysis with the appropriate antibodies using the ECL detection system (AmershamBiosciences). The signals were quantified with the QuantityOne® software from BioRad Laboratories, and the relative protein amounts were calculated. Solubilization conditions were tested with 50 μg of rabbit liver Golgi membranes (23Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11655-11663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After pelleting, the membranes were solubilized in 50 μl of the indicated buffers (containing 3% 8-n-octyl-poly-oxyethylene (POE), Alexis Corporation; 2% cholic acid, Sigma; or 4% octylglucoside (n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside), Calbiochem), incubated for 30 min on ice and subjected to 100,000 × gcentrifugation for 30 min. Pellets and the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated supernatants were then analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody against p23 (Henriette). Membrane pellets (equivalent to 50 nmol of phospholipid as determined by phosphate measurement) (24Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar) from subcellular fractionations were solubilized for 30 min on ice in 4% octylglucoside, 20 mmHepes, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, unless indicated differently. After centrifugation (1 h, 100,000 × g at 4 °C), the supernatant was fractionated on a Superdex 200 column on the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) using a flow rate of 50 μl/min and 1% octylglucoside, 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl as running buffer. All fractions were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, applied to SDS-PAGE (25Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar), and further analyzed by Western blotting with several p24 protein antibodies (Henriette, Elfriede, #2469R1, #2088M, #2087R2, #2501R2). The column was calibrated with gel filtration standards from BioRad Laboratories (thyroglobin (670 kDa), bovine-γ-globulin (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), vitamin B12 (1.35 kDa)) for calibration with membrane proteins. Golgi membranes from rabbit liver (23Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11655-11663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from Chinese hamster ovary cells containing a CD8-Myc-construct (CD8-LT) (26Nickel W. Malsam J. Gorgas K. Ravazzola M. Jenne N. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3081-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were mixed, pelleted, solubilized, and analyzed by gel filtration as described before. Thereafter, the fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis with antibodies against transferrin receptor (190 kDa), Calnexin (90 kDa), Myc (CD8-LT, 60 kDa) and cytochrome b5 (15 kDa). ER, intermediate compartment (IC), and Golgi membranes according to a phospholipid content of 6.25 nmol were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and treated either with DSG (final concentration 0.6 mm) in Me2SO or Me2SO alone for 30 min on ice. Tris-HCl, pH7.5, was added to stop the reaction, and the samples were further analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-p23 antibody (Thelma). Immunoprecipitations were carried out according to Ref. 13Gommel D. Orci L. Emig E.M. Hannah M.J. Ravazzola M. Nickel W. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. Sohn K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. In contrast to this study, the antibodies were covalently coupled to the protein A-Sepharose (19Harlowe E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to the cytoplasmic tail sequences of p24, p25, p26, p27, and tp24 with overhanging restriction sites for EcoRI andBamHI. After annealing of the oligonucleotides they were cloned into the EcoRI and BamHI site of the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The GST-p24 tail constructs were overexpressed and purified according to manufacturers' specifications. The sequence for the luminal domain of p23 was cloned into theBamHI and HindIII site of the pQE-30 vector (Qiagen), overexpressed, and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. The purity of the overexpressed proteins was tested by Coomassie staining, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (BioRad Laboratories). For immunofluorescence studies, Vero cells (ATTC CCL-81) were cultured on coverslips, incubated for 2 h at 15 °C in carbonate-free Hepes-buffered standard medium and afterward transferred to 37 °C for various time periods. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and labeled with p24 protein antibodies. They were affinity purified and anti-p23 (HAC344), -p24 (Elfriede), and -p25 (#2469R1) directly labeled with cy3, anti-p27 (#2087R2) with cy5 according to the manufacturers specifications (Amersham Biosciences). Additional antibodies used were detected with Alexa-488/456-coupled secondary antibodies. For confocal analysis a Leica TCS-SP with the Leica confocal software was used. For Western blot analysis s-HeLa cells were grown in Spinner culture, transferred in 15 °C cold, carbonate-free, Hepes-buffered standard medium, and incubated at 15 °C for 2.5 h. Cells were harvested at various time points, and subcellular fractionation was performed as described before. For each condition the distribution of marker enzymes was tested, and fractions were pooled accordingly. The amount of membrane in each pool was determined by nano-ESI-MS/MS (electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry) (27Brügger B. Sandhoff R. Wegehingel S. Gorgas K. Malsam J. Helms J.B. Lehmann W.D. Nickel W. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 507-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and identical amounts based on phosphatidylcholine content were subjected to Western blot analysis with p24 protein antibodies (Henriette, Elfriede, #2469R1, #2088M2, #2087R2, #2501R2), using the ECL detection system. The signals obtained were quantified with QuantityOne software, and the signals for each compartment were used to calculate relative protein amounts. GST-p24 tail constructs (p24, p25, p26, p27, and tp24) or the luminal domain of p23 were used as p24 standard proteins. Increasing amounts of standard protein (in ng) and membranes (in nmol of phospholipid) were subjected to gel electrophoresis (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and Western blotting with antibodies against p24 proteins (Henriette, Frieda, #2469R1, #2088M, #2087R2, #2501R2), and developed with the ECL detection system. The antibodies had been tested before to be specific for each p24 protein and not to cross-react with GST. The signals were quantified with the QuantityOne software, and standard curves with the data of the p24 standards were established. Only values of the membrane samples within these linear curves were taken into account to calculate the concentration of each p24 protein in ng of protein/nmol of phospholipid (see supplemental data Figure I at http://www.jbc.org ). For each protein, at least three independent estimations were made, each time with both the standards and the samples on the same blot. Independent experiments with different p24 protein antibodies in a second quantitative Western blot analysis were performed as an additional control, and comparable results were obtained (supplemental data Figure II). To fractionate ER, IC, and Golgi, HeLa cell membranes were subjected to density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig.1, these membranes of the early secretory pathway are well separated. Golgi membranes were found in light fractions (fractions 3 + 4), characterized by galactosyltransferase activity and the KDEL receptor (KDEL-R.), and are separated from plasma membrane in fraction 2 as shown by alkaline phosphodiesterase (AP) activity. The second peak of the KDEL receptor in the intermediate density fractions represents the membranes of the IC, as this protein localizes to the cis-Golgi and the IC, respectively (29Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Qi X.L. Low S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 30Griffiths G. Ericsson M. Krijnse-Locker J. Nilsson T. Goud B. Söling H.D. Tang B.L. Wong S.H. Hong W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1557-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast, ER membranes move to the high density region of the gradient (fractions 15–17), as shown by the distribution of PDI. The ER pool also contains mitochondria and peroxisomes as indicated by the distribution of p30 and PMP69. However, the amount of membrane according to peroxisomes in ER fractions can be disregarded as these membranes only constitute 1% of total membranes (31Griffiths G. Back R. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2703-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In contrast, mitochondria represent about 32% of total cell membranes (estimated for baby hamster kidney cells, (31Griffiths G. Back R. Marsh M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2703-2720Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar)) and thus only part of the membranes in the ER pool represents ER membranes. This was quantified and taken into account. Three different detergents were tested under the same buffer and salt conditions described before for the solubilization of p24 proteins (1Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 4Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2, only octylglucoside and 8POE were able to solubilize p23 almost quantitatively. Cholic acid, used previously to determine an oligomeric size of mammalian p24 proteins of 35S (1Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Füllekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) in our hands emerged to be unsuited for solubilization. Since an extensive study of p24 proteins in yeast was performed with octylglucoside, and this detergent solubilizes p23 nearly quantitatively (Fig. 2) (4Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Solari R.C. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), it was used for solubilization in further experiments. Equal amounts of ER, IC, and Golgi with regard to their phospholipid content were solubilized in 4% octylglucoside, and the p24 oligomers were separated by gel filtration. The fractions were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against all p24 proteins. As shown in Fig. 3, p24 proteins elute at two defined volumes with peaks in fractions 18 and 21. To determine the size of the p24 oligomers in these two peaks, we calibrated the gel filtration column with membrane proteins rather than soluble proteins, which, like p24 proteins, need a detergent micelle to stay in solution (Fig. 4 A). With reference to this calibration, p24 proteins appear as dimers and monomers in the ER, IC, and Golgi pools. To assess the oligomeric state of p23 independently, i.e. without the use of detergent, (i) soluble recombinant luminal domain of p23 was analyzed by gel filtration in the absence of detergent and (ii) ER, IC, and Golgi membranes were treated with a cross-linker (DSG) and afterward analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-p23 antibody (supplemental data Figs. III and IV). In both detergent-independent experiments a dimer is the highest oligomer observed. This clearly shows that the dimer observed in the gel filtration analysis is physiological and is not a result of the disruption of higher oligomers by the use of detergent.Figure 3Gel filtration analysis of p24 proteins.

As depicted in Fig.3 B, p23 is predominantly found as a dimer in the ER, but in the IC and the Golgi there are about equal amounts of dimer and monomer. In contrast, p24 shows a similar ratio between monomer and dimer in all membrane fractions. p25 and p27 exist predominantly as monomers, with p25 showing the highest amount of dimer in the ER and p27 in the Golgi. However, p26 and tp24, which coimmunoprecipitate to a significantly lower extent with other p24 members (16Füllekrug J. Suganuma T. Tang B.L. Hong W. Storrie B. Nilsson T. Mol. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 5 an anti-p24 antibody coimmunoprecipitates p23 and p25, and an anti-p27 antibody p23 and p24 from all compartments of the early secretory pathway.

Efforts at eliciting a 2F5-like immune response by immunization with peptides or fusion proteins containing this sequence have not met with success, possibly because of incorrect structural presentation of the epitope. Although the structure of the carboxyl-terminal heptad repeat on the virion is not known, several recent reports have suggested a propensity for α-helical conformation. We have examined DP178 in the context of a model for optimized α-helices and show that the native sequence conforms poorly to the model. Solution conformation of DP178 was studied by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy and found to be predominantly random, consistent with previous reports. NMR mapping was used to show that the low percentage of α-helix present was localized to residues Glu662 through Asn671, a region encompassing the 2F5 epitope. Using NH2-terminal extensions derived from either GP41 or the yeast GCN4 leucine zipper dimerization domain, we designed peptide analogs in which the average helicity is significantly increased compared with DP178 and show that these peptides exhibit both a modest increase in affinity for 2F5 using a novel competitive solution-based binding assay and an increased ability to inhibit viral entry in a single-cycle infectivity model. Selected peptides were conjugated to carrier protein and used for guinea pig immunizations. High peptide-specific titers were achieved using these immunogens, but the resulting sera were incapable of viral neutralization.

GP160 envelope glycoprotein is synthesized as a single precursor that is cleaved by a cellular endoprotease to generate two noncovalently associated subunits, GP120 and GP41 (1Moulard M. Decroly E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). GP120 is the receptor-interacting constituent, which mediates sequential binding to the cellular CD4 receptor and CXCR4 or CCR5 chemokine co-receptors. The GP41 transmembrane subunit mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes (reviewed in Refs. 2Chan D.C. Kim P.S.

Both envelope segments are highly immunogenic but antibodies raised by vaccination with full-length or subunit versions of these proteins, while capable of neutralizing homologous virus, are generally not protective against heterologous challenge (4Sattentau Q.J.

In contrast, several broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to diverse envelope epitopes have been identified in recent years. Among the most well characterized of these are 1b12 and 2G12, which bind to GP120 (7Burton D.R. Pyati J. Koduri R. Sharp S.J. Thornton G.B. Parren P. Sawyer L. Hendry R.M. Dunlop N. Nara P.L.

Katinger H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6642-6647Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MAb 2F5 has generated much interest because its epitope is well conserved across HIV clades and because of its ability to neutralize both laboratory-adapted and primary viral isolates (11Purtscher M. Trkola A. Grassauer A. Schulz P.M. Klima A. Döpper S. Gruber G. Buchacher A. Muster T. Katinger H. Aids. 1996; 10: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The envelope protein undergoes a conformational change upon receptor binding, with significant perturbations occurring in both subunit domains. It is postulated that the structural rearrangement that takes place in GP41 provides the energy required to bring viral and cellular membranes into apposition and to allow proper positioning of the NH2-terminal fusion peptide for bilayer interaction (12Melikyan G.B.

Biol. 2000; 301: 905-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This change from a prefusogenic to fusion-competent state has been intensively studied over the past several years, and the currently accepted model of the fusion-active conformation is that it is composed of a six-stranded helical bundle formed by association of NH2- and COOH-terminal heptad repeat regions of the ectodomain (16Weissenhorn W. Dessen A. Harrison S.C. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 426-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar, 17Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S.

A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). The interior of the bundle consists of a trimeric coiled coil formed by three NHRs comprising residues 546–581 (numbering based on the HXB2 GP160 variant as described in Ref. 17Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). This inner bundle is surrounded by three outer COOH-terminal helices that pack around the trimer in an antiparallel configuration. Proteolytic dissection studies identified a highly thermostable core structure as being composed of peptide domains N51, encompassing residues 540–590 and C43, encompassing residues 624–666, joined by a short linker sequence (19Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies showed that shorter peptides such as N36/C34 (17Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar) and N34/C28 (18Tan K. Liu J.-H. Wang J. Shens S. Lu M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12303-12308Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) also associate to form stable core-like assemblies. A number of isolated peptides whose sequences overlap either the NHR or CHR domains have been shown to be potent inhibitors of viral infectivity. These include N51 (19Lu M. Blacklow S.C. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), C34 (20Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15613-15617Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), and DP178 (21Wild C.T. Shugars D.C. Greenwell T.K. McDanal C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9770-9774Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that these compounds act in a dominant-negative manner, inhibiting fusion by binding to a nascent prehairpin derivative formed during the receptor-induced conformational change. The 36-mer peptide DP178, encompassing residues 638–673, has been the most well studied of these compounds. DP178, also known as T20, comprises the final 24 residues of C34 and continues to Phe673, reaching approximately halfway into the tryptophan-rich region defined by residues 665–683, which is postulated to maintain important contacts with the viral membrane (22Schibli D.J. Montelaro R.C. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9570-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Residues 662–667, ELDKWA, form the recognition epitope for mAb 2F5. Solution studies of DP178 show it to be largely unordered with a low content of α-helix. However, when DP178 is mixed with a NHR-derived peptide such as N36 a large increase in helicity is observed (23Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 24Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13922-13928Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The magnitude of this enhancement is higher than that predicted for theoretically noninteracting species, confirming that DP178 undergoes a conformational change upon interaction with N36 (23Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The structure of DP178 in the prefusogenic configuration on the native virion is unknown. Oligomerization studies of soluble, uncleaved GP140 constructs stabilized by trimeric GCN4 leucine zipper or T4 bacteriophage fibritin motifs offer compelling evidence that a trimeric structure is consistent with known antibody reactivities (25Yang X. Lee J. Mahony E.M. Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies suggest that the trimeric forms more closely resemble the prefusogenic state as supported by their low affinity for mAb NC-1 (26Jiang S. Lin K. Lu M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 10213-10217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and peptide DP178. The association of the CHR with the trimeric NHR bundle in the fusion-competent configuration is not that of a coiled coil because the orientation is tilted with regard to the core helices (17Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1822) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, predictive computational studies show a high propensity for the CHR region to exist as an amphipathic coiled coil (27Singh M. Berger B. Kim P.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 1031-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rabenstein et al. (24Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.-K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13922-13928Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) showed that the heptad repeat motif found in the CHR can be described as having “imperfect” amphipathic character and postulated that the entire sequence span from Val608 to Leu684 is likely helical in the viral fusion-competent state. Finally, Lawless et al. (23Lawless M.K. Barney S. Guthrie K.I. Bucy T.B. Petteway S.R. Merutka G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13697-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) had shown that self-association of DP178 occurred in a concentration-dependent manner, with tetramers forming at peptide concentrations greater than 20 μm. They suggest that the native prefusogenic state could involve an oligomeric T20 structure that re-arranges upon CD4 binding to form the final highly thermostable 6-helix bundle. DP178 effectively inhibits both cell-free viral infectivity and cell-cell fusion at low nanomolar concentrations, and it is currently being evaluated as a therapeutic in human clinical trials (28Kilby J.M. Hopkins S. Venetta T.M. Dimassimo B. Cloud G.A. Lee J.Y. Alldredge L. Hunter E. Lambert D. Bolognesi D. Matthews T. Johnson M.R. Nowak M.A. Shaw G.M. Saag M.S. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). The potential value of this compound is further enhanced by observations that primary viral isolates are slow to develop resistance to it. However, a relatively long peptide such as DP178 suffers from several limitations including bioavailability, proteolytic sensitivity, and eventual mutation-induced resistance. Alternatively, the use of the peptide as a vaccine candidate is attractive because it contains the recognition epitope for 2F5. However, fusion proteins containing the epitope have uniformly failed to produce a broadly protective response (6Coëffier E. Clément J. Cussac V. Khodaei-Boorane N. Jehanno M. Rojas M. Dridi A. Latour M. Habib R. Barré-Sinoussi F. Hofnung M. Leclerc C. Vaccine. 2001; 19: 684-693Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Eckhart L. Raffelsberger W. Ferko B. Klima A. Purtscher M. Katinger H. Ruker F. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2001-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One explanation for this may be that the 2F5 epitope was not presented in the correct structural context in these constructs. Sattentau et al. (30Sattentau Q.J. Zolla-Pazner S. Poignard P. Virology. 1995; 206: 713-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) showed that whereas 2F5 could bind to virally infected cells, binding was abrogated when these cells were first treated with soluble CD4. Similar results were observed in a recent study of binding to synthetic peptides in solution (31Gorny M.K. Zolla-Pazner S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6186-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These data suggest that 2F5 recognizes either the native prefusogenic conformation of ELDKWA or a transient intermediate structure. Studies such as those by Judice et al. (32Judice J.K. Tom J.Y.K. Huang W. Wrin T. Vennari J. Petropoulos C.J. McDowell R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13426-13430Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) in which chemical constraints were introduced into DP178 to maintain helicity, and Rootet al. (33Root M.J. Kay M.S. Kim P.S. Science. 2001; 291: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) who prepared a linear protein that self-folded into a stable 5-helical bundle show that enhanced infectivity inhibition can be obtained with highly constrained structures. Finally, a recent crystallographic report of the peptide ELDKWAS bound to the Fab′ fragment of 2F5 suggests that the epitope adopts a defined turn (34.Pai, E. F., Klein, M. H., Chong, P., and Pedyczak, A. (October 19, 2000) World Intellectual Property Organization,U. S. Patent WO-00/61618.Google Scholar). We were interested in evaluating whether increasing the helicity of DP178 constructs led to an enhanced interaction with mAb 2F5 and if these constructs were capable of eliciting a broadly neutralizing antibody response. We decided to optimize the amphipathic character of the peptide with the reasoning that if this provided a significantly better interaction with 2F5, it would support the hypothesis for interacting CHR subunits in the prefusogenic virion. Working from a model that described optimization of amphipathic helices in peptides (35Mant C.T. Chao H. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1997; 791: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) we prepared chemically unconstrained peptide constructs designed to present the ELDKWA epitope in the context of a highly α-helical structure and used circular dichroism (CD) to confirm the predictions of the model. To determine whether presentation of the ELDKWA epitope in a helical format was a supportable hypothesis, we studied the structure of native DP178 by NMR and show, for the first time, that the carboxyl-terminal portion of DP178 accounts for the low α-helical content reported in previous studies. To quantitatively rank the ability of these peptides to bind to mAb 2F5 we developed a true solution-based competitive binding assay that represents a significant improvement over previously described solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems in terms of preserving peptide structure. Finally, to determine whether these structured peptides were capable of generating a 2F5-like immune response, modified DP178 peptides were conjugated to a carrier protein and tested in guinea pig vaccination experiments. We discuss the implications regarding the ability of these immunogens to elicit high titer, nonneutralizing responses with regard to efforts aimed at generating 2F5-like responses by peptide immunization. Synthetic peptides corresponding to DP178 and modified analogs were prepared by standard t-Boc solid phase synthesis in-house or purchased from Bio-Synthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Peptides were synthesized as the free amino and carboxyl forms. Peptides intended for conjugation to carrier proteins were synthesized with a cysteine residue on either the amino or carboxyl terminus and these constructs were made as the N-acylated and C-amidated derivatives. Peptides that were not directly soluble in water or neutral pH buffer were initially solubilized at 1–5 mg/ml in dilute NaOH and immediately neutralized by dilution into appropriate buffers. Solution concentrations were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis. CD measurements were made at 25 °C on a Jasco model J810 spectropolarimeter equipped with Peltier temperature controller and running Jasco version 1.52.01 Spectra Manager software. Spectra were acquired from 180 to 250 nm using a bandwidth of 1 nm and data pitch of 0.1 nm at a scan speed of 100 nm/min with 10 accumulations per sample. Spectra were corrected for solvent contribution and the CD signal was converted to molar ellipticity, [Θ], by [Θ] = Θobserved (MRW/10 × l × c), where MRW is the mean residue weight (molecular mass divided by number of peptide bonds),l is path length, and c is concentration in mg/ml. The fractional percentage of α helix (f α) was estimated from [Θ]222 nm by, 100% f α = −40,000 [1 − (2.5/n)], where n = number of peptide bonds. For helix-induction studies, samples were adjusted to a final concentration of 30% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C. Samples for NMR measurements contained 0.5–1.5 mm peptide in either phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 6.25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.15m NaCl) or 50% CD3CN, 50% H2O (v/v) or 50% CD3CN, 50% D2O (v/v) in a final sample volume of 0.650 ml. The water resonance in all experiments was suppressed by low power saturation using an attenuated transmitter pulse. All two-dimensional experiments were acquired in the hypercomplex mode for phase-sensitive presentation. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 at 0.00 ppm. Sequence-specific chemical shift assignments were obtained with the combination of TOCSY (36Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 55: 521-526Google Scholar, 37Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn.

Magn. Reson. 1982; 47: 328-335Google Scholar) spectra were recorded with 1 K complex points in t 2 and 512 points in t 1 consisting of 4–32 transients per increment. Spin locking was achieved with an MLEV16 + 60° mixing sequence for a duration of 50–75 ms preceded by a 2.0-ms trim pulse. Data sets were multiplied by a shifted Gaussian apodization function and zero filled to 2 K by 1 K complex points prior to Fourier transformation. ROESY spectra were acquired using a spin lock radiofrequency strength, γH2 of ∼3.8 kHz with a 100-ms mixing period. Spin locking was achieved by the application of a series of 30° pulses to minimize TOCSY artifacts in the spectrum and two hard 90° pulses on either side of the spin lock to compensate for resonance offset effects (42Griesinger C. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 261-271Google Scholar). The data were acquired with 1 K complex points in t 2 and 512 points int 1 consisting of 32–96 transients per increment. The data was processed as described above. NOESY spectra were acquired using mixing times of 100–500 ms. Solvent suppression was achieved by selective saturation of the water resonance during the recycle delay, t 1 period, and mixing period. Data sets were acquired with 1 K complex points int 2 and 512 points in t 1with 32–64 transients per increment. The data was processed as described above. The NOE intensities were analyzed by volume integration of the cross-peaks in well resolved regions of the spectrum. Eight-well MAXISORPTMImmunoTM Module strips (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) were coated with mAb 2F5 (Polymun, Vienna, Austria) at 20 ng/well in PBS and overcoated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. The reference peptide (biotin-DP178) was Ac-Cys-DP178-NH2, which had been biotin-labeled by reaction with PEO-maleimide activated biotin (Pierce) as per the manufacturer's protocol and purified by gel filtration chromatography. The reference peptide was used at 8 × 10−14 mol/well. Test samples were dissolved at a nominal concentration of 1 mg/ml (w/v) and diluted 500-fold in assay diluent (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20TM and 0.1% sodium azide) as the top point for a 3-fold, 7-point dilution series. An equal volume of test sample and biotin-DP178 (125 μl of each) were mixed in a tube and 200 μl was added to a well precoated with mAb 2F5. After an overnight incubation at ambient temperature the wells were washed with diluent and detection of bound biotin-DP178 was accomplished with horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin utilizing 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate. P4/R5 cells (HeLa cells with a stably integrated LTR-LacZ reporter gene cassette and expressing CD4 and CCR5) maintained in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum were seeded in 96-well plates at 2.5 × 103 cells/well and infected the following day with the HXB2 strain of HIV-1 (Advanced Biotechnology Inc., Bethesda, MD) at a multiplicity of infection of ∼0.01 in the presence of titrations of inhibitors or antisera. After incubating an additional 48 h, cells were lysed and β-galactosidase was detected using GalScreenTM chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were obtained using a Dynex luminometer. IC50 values were calculated by fitting data to the following 3-parameter logistic equation, y = m 1 + ((m 2 − m 1)/(1 + (10^(Log(x) − Log(IC50))))), wherex = concentration of inhibitor, y = blue/green ratio, m 1 = assay background,m 2 = highest (100%) signal in assay. Maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (Pierce) was used as an immune stimulatory carrier for peptide immunizations. Cysteine-containing peptides were solubilized in 10 mm NaOH, immediately adjusted to neutral pH, and thiol content was determined by the method of Ellman (43Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar). Peptide and carrier were mixed to target a given mole percent of available KLH maleimide groups as determined by the manufacturer. For quantitative assessment of conjugation a maleimide-activated KLH control (no added peptide) was processed identically along with the conjugates. Conjugations were performed in 83 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.9 m NaCl at a final carrier concentration of 1–2 mg/ml for 3–5 h at 25 °C. Residual maleimide groups were quenched using a 10-fold molar excess of l-cysteine hydrochloride for 1 h. Residual free peptide was removed by exhaustive dialysis against conjugation buffer using 300-kDa molecular mass cutoff membranes. Protein content of dialyzed conjugates and control was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Quantitation of peptide incorporation into the conjugate was determined by amino acid analysis as previously described (44Shuler K.R. Dunham R.G. Kanda P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 156: 137-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Female guinea pigs of 4–8 weeks old were obtained from Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA, and maintained in the animal facilities of Merck Research Laboratories in accordance with institutional guidelines. Peptide-carrier conjugates were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Immediately prior to immunization the saponin-based adjuvant QS21 (45Soltysik S. Wu J.-Y. Recchia J. Wheeler D.A. Newman M.J. Coughlin R.T. Kensil C.R. Vaccine. 1995; 13: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was added to the conjugate to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. For immunizations, guinea pigs were injected via the quadriceps with 400 μl of formulated conjugate. The immunization was given three times at 4-week intervals. Blood samples were collected 3 weeks post each injection, and stored at 2–8 °C until assayed. Streptavidin-coated 96-well plates (Pierce) were coated overnight with 0.2 μg of biotinylated peptide in 50 μl of bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, per well at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and blocked with 3% skim milk in PBST (milk-PBST). Serial 1:4 dilutions of testing samples were prepared in milk-PBST and 100 μl was added to each well of the antigen-coated plates. The plates were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h, washed three times with PBST, and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco CA) at 25 °C for 1 h. The plates were washed three times and 100 μl of 1 mg/ml o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate (Sigma) was added per well. Plates were incubated 30 min and the absorbance at 490 nm was read. Antibody titers were calculated as reciprocals of the highest dilutions, which gave optical density values above two standard deviations of the mean of the secondary antibody conjugate control. The model of Mant et al. (35Mant C.T. Chao H. Hodges R.S. J. Chromatogr. 1997; 791: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was used to design DP178-based peptides of increased α-helical content. Fig. 1 Apresents the Mant optimized model sequence and shows how DP178 and the modified analogs conform to the model. Two strategies were employed for the analog constructions.

Like major histocompatibility complex class I molecules, they form a heterodimeric complex of a heavy chain and β2-microglobulin (β2m) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Binding of lipid antigens, however, takes place in endosomal compartments, similar to class II molecules, and on the plasma membrane. Unlike major histocompatibility complex class I or CD1b molecules, which need β2m to exit the ER, CD1d can be expressed on the cell surface as either a free heavy chain or associated with β2m. These differences led us to investigate early events of CD1d biosynthesis and maturation and the role of ER chaperones in its assembly. Here we show that CD1d associates in the ER with both calnexin and calreticulin and with the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 in a manner dependent on glucose trimming of its N-linked glycans. Complete disulfide bond formation in the CD1d heavy chain was substantially impaired if the chaperone interactions were blocked by the glucosidase inhibitors castanospermine or N-butyldeoxynojirimycin. The formation of at least one of the disulfide bonds in the CD1d heavy chain is coupled to its glucose trimming-dependent association with ERp57, calnexin, and calreticulin.

The human CD1a, -b, and -c molecules constitute group I, whereas human and mouse CD1d molecules form group II. Like classical MHC class I and class II molecules, CD1 molecules are recognized by T cells. Certain αβ+ and γδ+ CD4-CD8− T cells were initially shown to lyse tumor cells expressing CD1a or CD1c (2Porcelli S. Brenner M.B. Greenstein J.L. Balk S.P. Terhorst C. Bleicher P.A.

Subsequent studies showed that mycobacterial lipids, such as mycolic acids, lipoarabinomannan, phosphatidylinositol mannosides, and hexosyl-1-phosphoisoprenoids could be presented to cytotoxic T cells by CD1b and CD1c molecules (3Porcelli S.

Med. 1998; 188: 1529-1534Google Scholar). Recently, natural lipid ligands, including phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylethanolamine, recognizable by autoreactive CD1d-restricted T cells, have been identified (16Gumperz J.E. Roy C.

The structure of CD1 is similar to that of MHC class I molecules in that CD1 molecules form heterodimers of 43–49-kDa heavy chains noncovalently associated with β2-microglobulin (β2m). However, unlike class I molecules, which bind peptide antigens in the ER, CD1 glycoproteins, like class II molecules, survey antigens in the endocytic pathway. Peptide binding by class I molecules is an essential requirement for their egress from the ER. CD1d molecules may bind autologous lipids in the ER, such as phosphatidylinositol or glycosylphosphatidylinositol (17Joyce S. Woods A.S. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. De Silva A.D. Boesteanu A. Balk S.P.

Immunol. 2002; 168: 723-733Google Scholar), to satisfy quality control mechanisms and allow transport, before exchanging them in the endocytic pathway for other autologous or foreign lipids. Previous studies have examined the assembly of CD1 molecules. CD1b heavy chain was observed to bind calnexin and calreticulin in the ER and to require β2m for subsequent transport to the cell surface (19Huttinger R. Staffler G. Majdic O. Stockinger H. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 1615-1623Google Scholar, 20Sugita M. Porcelli S.A. Brenner M.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2358-2365Google Scholar). In contrast, mouse and human CD1d molecules are expressed both as free heavy chains and as complexes with β2m. This was observed not only in transfectants but also in primary tissue cells (21Balk S.P. Burke S. Polischuk J.E. Frantz M.E. Yang L. Porcelli S. Colgan S.P. Blumberg R.S.

Dick M.D. Brossay L. Kronenberg M. Herzenberg L.A. Strober S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1710-1717Google Scholar). CD1d expressed in β2m-negative cells is fully capable of activating cognate T cells (23Amano M. Baumgarth N. Dick M.D. Brossay L. Kronenberg M. Herzenberg L.A. Strober S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1710-1717Google Scholar, 24Cardell S. Tangri S. Chan S. Kronenberg M. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 993-1004Google Scholar), indicating that heterodimer formation may not be critical for CD1d function. Although a recent study showed that β2m seems to modulate the structure of the heavy chain carbohydrates (22Kim H.S. Garcia J. Exley M. Johnson K.W. Balk S.P. Blumberg R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9289-9295Google Scholar), the underlying mechanisms regulating CD1d expression with or without β2m remain to be elucidated. Here we present a detailed analysis of CD1d biosynthesis and an examination of the roles of ER chaperones in CD1d assembly. We show that CD1d heavy chains associate with calnexin, calreticulin, and the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 and demonstrate a role for this association in the formation of CD1d heavy chain disulfide bonds.

The mAb AF8 (anti-calnexin (31Hochstenbach F. David V. Watkins S. Brenner M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4734-4738Google Scholar)) was a gift from Dr. M.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2443-2453Google Scholar). The vector CD1d/pSRα-neo was a gift of Dr. S. Porcelli. C1R and .221 cells were transfected by electroporation at 230 and 210 V/960 microfarads, respectively. C1R.CD1d and .221.CD1d were selected for neomycin resistance at 1.8 and 0.6 mg/ml G418, respectively. They were screened for CD1d expression by flow cytometry. Labeling with [35S]methionine and cysteine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA), immunoprecipitations, and endoglycosidase H (Endo H) digestion were performed as previously described (33Denzin L.K. Hammond C. Cresswell P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2153-2165Google Scholar). Reimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed as described (34Kang S.J. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1650-1660Google Scholar). For elution in reducing conditions, washed primary immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in 100 μl of 1% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), TBS (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) before diluting with 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmiodoacetamide, TBS. For nonreducing elution, DTT and iodoacetamide were omitted. The beads were centrifuged and the supernatants were used for the second immunoprecipitations. The samples were boiled with Laemmli SDS sample buffer and separated by reducing, unless indicated otherwise, SDS-PAGE prior to autoradiography. All quantitation was performed using Bio-Rad GS-525 phosphorimaging and Molecular Analyst Software. Cells were metabolically labeled for 45 min and lysed on ice in 1% digitonin in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) with or without 1 mmDSP. Lysates were diluted in 1% digitonin or 1.2% Triton X-100 before immunoprecipitation. CD1d biosynthesis was examined in the B-LCL, C1R.CD1d, which is capable of activating CD1d-specific T cells (15Spada F.M. Koezuka Y. Porcelli S.A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1529-1534Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 15 min and chased up to 20 h. They were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with the anti-CD1d antibodies, 51.1.3 or D5, which recognize heavy chain-β2m dimers and free heavy chains, respectively. Exit from the ER was monitored by loss of susceptibility to Endo H. Fig. 1 shows that the majority of Endo H-sensitive free heavy chains were converted to heavy chain-β2m complexes within 2 h (Fig. 1 B). Both β2m-associated CD1d heavy chains and the residual free heavy chains underwent complex carbohydrate modification, manifested as smeared bands, starting at about 1 h for the heterodimer and 2–4 h for the free heavy chains. Concomitant loss of Endo H-sensitive bands indicates transport from the ER, and these results indicate that β2m facilitates, but is not essential for, CD1d exit from the ER. That 51.1.3-recognizable CD1d is associated with β2m was confirmed by comparing kinetics of maturation by immunoprecipitation with 51.1.3 and with anti-β2m serum. The immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads by boiling in 1% SDS/DTT/TBS, diluted in 1% Triton X-100/iodoacetamide/TBS, and the supernatants were reimmunoprecipitated with D5. Immunoprecipitation with either antibody showed identical CD1d transport kinetics in C1R.CD1d and in a second CD1d-expressing cell line, .221.CD1d (Fig. 1 C). To examine how fast CD1d heterodimers arrive at the cell surface, C1R.CD1d cells were radiolabeled for 15 min and chased up to 8 h. At each chase point, surface CD1d was captured by incubating the cells with the 51.1.3 mAb. Unbound 51.1.3 was removed by washing and the surface CD1d was isolated by adding protein G-Sepharose after lysis. The residual, mostly intracellular, CD1d was immunoprecipitated by adding additional 51.1.3 and protein G-Sepharose (Fig.2 A). The immunoprecipitates were eluted from the beads, and released CD1d heavy chains were reimmunoprecipitated with the D5 mAb. The results showed that CD1d was detectable at the cell surface after 1 h and reached a plateau after ∼2.5 h (Fig. 2, B, upper panel, andC). The rate of transport to the cell surface was approximately the same as the rate of complex carbohydrate modification (Figs. 1 and 2 B, lower panel). This suggests that the majority of newly synthesized CD1d is transported along the secretory pathway through the Golgi to the cell surface without detouring through endosomal compartments like class II molecules. Transport to the cell surface is not as rapid as seen for MHC class I molecules, but is faster than for MHC class II, a pattern very similar to that observed for CD1b (35Briken V. Jackman R.M. Dasgupta S. Hoening S. Porcelli S.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 825-834Google Scholar). We observed similar surface transport kinetics by using a surface biotinylation technique (data not shown). To determine whether the ER-resident proteins involved with the assembly of MHC class I molecules associate with CD1d, we performed co-immunoprecipitations in the detergent digitonin, conditions where their interactions with class I are maintained. Class I heavy chains bound calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), and tapasin, whereas CD1d associated only with the chaperones calnexin and calreticulin (data not shown). This is consistent with previous studies of TAP-deficient cells that showed that the class I peptide loading complex is not involved with CD1d assembly (36Brutkiewicz R.R. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Bendelac A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1913-1919Google Scholar, 37Teitell M. Holcombe H.R. Brossay L. Hagenbaugh A. Jackson M.J. Pond L. Balk S.P. Terhorst C. Peterson P.A. Kronenberg M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2143-2149Google Scholar). We also observed normal surface expression of CD1d in the tapasin-negative .220 B-LCL (38Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Google Scholar) transfected with CD1d (data not shown). Calnexin and calreticulin are homologous lectin domain-containing ER chaperones that regulate glycoprotein folding in the ER by interacting with their N-linked glycans (reviewed in Ref. 39Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 431-437Google Scholar). After transfer to a protein two terminal glucose residues are removed from the glycan by glucosidase I. Glycoproteins bearing monoglucosylatedN-linked glycans bind calnexin and calreticulin through their lectin domains and undergo folding and assembly. After release by the action of glucosidase II, which removes the terminal glucose, proper folding is monitored by the enzyme UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, which reglucosylates the N-linked glycans of nonnative structures. A correct conformation allows the glycoprotein to avoid reglucosylation and further interactions with calnexin and calreticulin. To determine whether calnexin and calreticulin association with CD1d is dependent on glucose trimming, radiolabeled C1R.CD1d cells were incubated with the glucosidase inhibitor CST for various times. Calnexin and calreticulin dissociation from CD1d was inhibited by CST, indicating that both interactions are glycan-dependent (data not shown). Calnexin and calreticulin cooperate with the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 to facilitate the formation or isomerization of disulfide bonds during glycoprotein folding (40Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Google Scholar, 41Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6912Google Scholar, 42Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Google Scholar, 43Molinari M. Helenius A. Nature. 1999; 402: 90-93Google Scholar). To investigate this for CD1d we first examined the redox state of CD1d heavy chains at various stages; the forms associated with calnexin or calreticulin, the β2m-free, D5-reactive immature form, and the β2m-associated, 51.1.3-reactive mature form. C1R.CD1d cells were labeled for 45 min and extracts were immunoprecipitated with 51.1.3, D5, anti-calnexin, or anti-calreticulin antibodies. Anti-chaperone immunoprecipitates were eluted under nonreducing conditions (1% SDS and boiling), diluted in Triton X-100, and CD1d heavy chains were reimmunoprecipitated with D5. After treatment with Endo H to remove N-linked glycans and improve resolution, SDS-PAGE analysis showed that, whereas all forms of CD1d had identical mobilities under reducing conditions, there were differences under nonreducing conditions, reflecting differences in oxidation states (Fig. 3). β2m-associated CD1d heavy chains had the greatest mobility, i.e. were the most oxidized, whereas the calnexin- and calreticulin-associated forms and the D5-recognized form showed the same two bands. One is identical in mobility to the putatively fully oxidized, 51.1.3-recognized form, whereas the second is intermediate between that form and that seen upon complete reduction, consistent with only one of the internal disulfide bonds being oxidized. We did not detect ERp57 association with CD1d under conditions that maintain the association between ERp57 and the class I loading complex (data not shown). However, detergents disrupt the interaction of ERp57 with most glycoproteins. We therefore used a cross-linking agent to preserve the interaction. C1R.CD1d cells were labeled for 45 min and lysed in 1% digitonin in the absence or presence of the reducible cross-linking agent, DSP (1 mm). The extracts were diluted in 1% Triton X-100 and immunoprecipitated with antibodies to ERp57, calnexin, calreticulin, and, as a negative control, Grp94. After elution in SDS, CD1d heavy chains were reimmunoprecipitated with the mAb D5 followed by reducing SDS-PAGE. The results show that CD1d remains associated with ERp57 only if cross-linker is added (Fig.4 A). The association of CD1d with calnexin and calreticulin was maintained in Triton X-100 without the cross-linker, and no interaction with Grp94 was observed regardless of the presence of the cross-linker. By serial immunoprecipitation and SDS stripping, first with anti-ERp57 followed by anti-calnexin or anti-calreticulin and then by anti-CD1d, we also observed ternary complexes of ERp57, CD1d, and calnexin or calreticulin when the DSP cross-linker was used (Fig. 4 B). To ask whether ERp57 association with CD1d is glucose trimming-dependent, C1R.CD1d cells were labeled for 45 min in the absence or presence of glucosidase inhibitors CST orN-butyldeoxynojirimycin. DSP cross-linked lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against ERp57, calnexin, or calreticulin, SDS-eluted, and reimmunoprecipitated with the anti-CD1d antibody, D5. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that ERp57, together with calnexin and calreticulin, failed to associate with CD1d in the presence of the inhibitors (Fig. 4 C). Previous reports indicate that ERp57 does not have lectin-like domains (41Zapun A. Darby N.J. Tessier D.C. Michalak M. Bergeron J.J. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6009-6912Google Scholar). These data, together with other reports (40Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Google Scholar, 44Van der Wal F.J. Oliver J.D. High S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 256: 51-59Google Scholar), indicate that CD1d associates with ERp57 indirectly via the lectin domains of calnexin or calreticulin. During assembly of class I molecules newly synthesized free heavy chains associate with calnexin, whereas class I-β2m heterodimers associate with calreticulin (45Sadasivan B. Lehner P.J. Ortmann B. Spies T. Cresswell P. Immunity. 1996; 5: 103-114Google Scholar). To determine whether this is the case for CD1d, C1R.CD1d cells were radiolabeled for 45 min, lysed in 1% digitonin, and the extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-β2m serum. β2m-associated molecules were competitively eluted with human β2m and reimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against calnexin and calreticulin. The associated CD1d was detected by immunoprecipitation with D5. The data show that, whereas class I-β2m dimers (HLA-C molecules in this case) were co-precipitated with calreticulin, CD1d-β2m dimers were co-precipitated with neither calnexin nor calreticulin (Fig.4 D). This indicates that both calnexin and calreticulin interact only with free CD1d heavy chains. Because both calnexin and calreticulin associate with β2m-free CD1d heavy chain, and CD1d has fourN-glycans, 2S.-J. Kang and P. Cresswell, unpublished observation. it seemed possible that CD1d heavy chain could form a ternary complex with both calnexin and calreticulin. This was tested by additional serial immunoprecipitation/stripping experiments on DSP cross-linked extracts. The results clearly show the existence of such a ternary complex (Fig.4 E). Given that both calnexin- and calreticulin-associated CD1d heavy chains are also associated with ERp57, the existence of a quaternary complex of CD1d, calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 seems likely. The data suggest that disulfide bond formation in CD1d heavy chains is regulated by ERp57. Given that D5-reactive, calnexin-associated, and calreticulin-associated CD1d heavy chains show the same two bands on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3), we hypothesized that the D5-reactive partially oxidized form initially associates with calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57 and that formation of the second disulfide bond occurs during association. If this is correct, inhibition of the CD1d-chaperone interaction should result in the accumulation of D5-reactive partially oxidized CD1d heavy chains. To test this, C1R.CD1d cells were radiolabeled for 5 min and chased in the absence or presence of CST. CD1d heavy chains were immunoprecipitated with D5, treated with Endo H, and subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE. The ratio of partially oxidized to fully oxidized heavy chains was indeed higher throughout the chase period in the presence of CST (Fig. 5, Aand B). A model of the early biogenesis of CD1d molecules based on the data presented here is depicted in Fig.6. For simplicity only two of theN-linked glycans are shown. Calnexin and calreticulin simultaneously associate via monoglucosylated N-linked glycans with newly synthesized CD1d heavy chains in which one disulfide bond is already formed. Here we show the nonoxidized one as that in the α2 domain although there is no evidence to support this. Calnexin and/or calreticulin bring ERp57 to the β2m-free CD1d heavy chain and this mediates the formation of the second disulfide bond. The terminal glucose residues of theN-linked glycans are trimmed and the fully oxidized CD1d heavy chain then dissociates from the chaperones. The majority of the CD1d binds β2m but it can leave the ER even without it. Useful comparisons can be made between the assembly pathway illustrated in Fig. 6 and that of classical MHC class I molecules and even class II molecules. Both of these pathways involve calnexin, and class I assembly also involves calreticulin and ERp57. Class II molecules consist of heterodimers of transmembrane glycoproteins that associate with trimers of a third glycoprotein, the invariant chain, in the ER. Intermediates containing one or two αβ dimers bound to an invariant chain trimer remain associated with calnexin until the ultimate nonameric complex with three αβ dimers is complete (46Anderson K.S. Cresswell P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 675-682Google Scholar). Whether ERp57 plays a role in this process is unknown. In class I assembly, newly synthesized heavy chains first bind calnexin. Calreticulin replaces calnexin when β2m binds to the heavy chain, and, together with associated ERp57, this assembly is recruited to become part of a multisubunit “peptide loading complex” that also contains the heterodimeric TAP transporter and transmembrane glycoprotein tapasin (reviewed in Ref. 47Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Google Scholar). Recruitment of class I molecules to the loading complex requires calreticulin (48Gao B. Adhikari R. Howarth M. Nakamura K. Gold M.C. Hill A.B. Knee R. Michalak M. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 99-109Google Scholar) and depends upon the generation of a monoglucosylated N-linked glycan in the class I heavy chain (40Elliott J.G. Oliver J.D. High S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13849-13855Google Scholar). 3Radcliffe, C. M., Diedrich, G., Harvey, D. J., Dwek, R. A., Cresswell, P., and Rudd, P. M. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 46415–46423.Recently it has been shown that tapasin binds to ERp57 via an interchain disulfide bond, and cooperates with ERp57 in forming the correct disulfide bonds in the class I heavy chain (49Dick T.P. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Google Scholar). Formation of the loading complex, including calreticulin association (48Gao B. Adhikari R. Howarth M. Nakamura K. Gold M.C. Hill A.B. Knee R. Michalak M. Elliott T. Immunity. 2002; 16: 99-109Google Scholar) and tapasin-mediated ERp57 association, is required for proper peptide binding to class I molecules, and peptide binding is required for the class I-β2m dimer to leave the ER (50Degen E. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Williams D.B. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1653-1661Google Scholar, 51Sugita M. Brenner M.B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2163-2171Google Scholar). Thus, this whole process can be understood as a unique quality control mechanism in which all the components, i.e. β2m, calnexin, calreticulin, ERp57, TAP, tapasin, and even peptides, participate. There are obviously significant differences between the CD1d and MHC class I assembly and transport pathways. First, β2m association is not as critical for CD1d folding as it is for conventional class I molecules. Complete disulfide bond formation is achieved before β2m associates with CD1d and β2m-free CD1d heavy chain can leave the ER. This is further supported by previous studies, which showed that, even in vivo, β2m is not critical for the function of CD1d. β2m-free CD1d expressed in splenic cells from β2m-deficient mice is fully capable of activating cognate T cells (23Amano M. Baumgarth N. Dick M.D. Brossay L. Kronenberg M. Herzenberg L.A. Strober S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1710-1717Google Scholar, 24Cardell S. Tangri S. Chan S. Kronenberg M. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 993-1004Google Scholar). Second, the point in the assembly process where calreticulin interacts with MHC class I is different from that with CD1d. Class I associates with calreticulin only when complexed with β2m, whereas CD1d associates with calreticulin as a free heavy chain. Moreover, CD1d can form a quaternary complex with calnexin, calreticulin, and ERp57. Calnexin and calreticulin may bind to different glycans of the CD1d heavy chain, similar to the situation with influenza virus hemagglutinin (52Hebert D.N. Zhang J.X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Google Scholar). How calnexin and calreticulin mediate the folding of CD1d heavy chain and which one is responsible for recruiting ERp57 remains to be elucidated. Surface expression of CD1d in the calnexin-negative cell CEM.NKR is not impaired 4S.-J. Kang and P. Cresswell, unpublished data. so calreticulin may be more critical for CD1d folding and assembly. Third, class I assembly may need to be tightly coupled to peptide loading because class I must survey the available peptides in the ER and optimize the associated repertoire. Quality control of CD1d may not need to be tightly coupled to optimal lipid binding in the ER, although lipids may bind there (see below), because it samples antigenic lipids in the endocytic pathway. In other words, optimization of antigen binding may be separable from quality control, being restricted to the place where antigen presenting molecules survey antigens. This is further substantiated by studies of class Ib molecules, H2-M3, HLA-E, and Qa-1. These are structurally similar to class I molecules but bind hydrophobic peptides,N-formylated peptides, or signal peptides of class Ia molecules, respectively. When their cognate peptides are not available, they are retained in the ER (53Chiu N.M. Chun T. Fay M. Mandal M. Wang C.R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 423-434Google Scholar, 54Chun T. Grandea 3rd, A.G.

Immunity. 1998; 9: 413-421Google Scholar, 58Bai A. Aldrich C.J. Forman J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7025-7034Google Scholar). Similarly, the stability of class II molecules is determined by peptide exchange mediated in the endocytic pathway by DM molecules. Given the hydrophobic nature of the CD1d binding groove it seems unlikely that the CD1d molecule would satisfy ER quality control mechanisms, and avoid reglucosylation of one or more of itsN-linked glycans by UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, unless the groove is occupied. As already discussed, the binding site of class I molecules must be occupied by peptides, and the peptide binding site of MHC class II molecules also must be occupied for efficient transport from the ER, in this case by the CLIP region of the invariant chain. For the CD1d family, ER-derived lipids, such as the phosphatidylinositol and glycosylphosphatidylinositol associated with soluble, secreted mouse CD1d, are the likely occupants of the binding groove in the ER (17Joyce S. Woods A.S. Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. De Silva A.D. Boesteanu A. Balk S.P. Cotter R.J. Brutkiewicz R.R. Science. 1998; 279: 1541-1544Google Scholar,18De Silva A.D. Park J.J. Matsuki N. Stanic A.K.

The double bond is introduced into the growing acyl chain by FabA, an enzyme capable of both the dehydration of β-hydroxydecanoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) to trans-2-decenoyl-ACP, and the isomerization of trans-2 to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP. However, there are a number of anaerobic bacteria whose genomes do not contain a fabA homolog, although these organisms nonetheless produce unsaturated fatty acids. We cloned and biochemically characterized a new enzyme in type II fatty acid synthesis from Streptococcus pneumoniae that carries out the isomerization of trans-2-decenoyl-ACP tocis-3-decenoyl-ACP, but is not capable of catalyzing the dehydration of β-hydroxy intermediates. This tetrameric enzyme, designated FabM, has no similarity to FabA, but rather is a member of the hydratase/isomerase superfamily. Thus, the branch point in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in S. pneumoniae occurs following the formation oftrans-2-decenoyl-ACP, in contrast to E. coliwhere the branch point takes place after the formation of β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP.

In eukaryotes, olefin formation requires molecular oxygen (1Bloomfied D. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 337-345Google Scholar), and double bonds are introduced into the fatty acids following the completion of their synthesis via the type I, multifunctional fatty acid synthase (2Smith S. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1248-1259Google Scholar). In contrast, bacteria synthesize fatty acids using the dissociated, type II fatty acid synthase system in which each of the steps is catalyzed by distinct enzymes that are encoded by separate genes (3Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Google Scholar). The key players in UFA synthesis were first defined by the isolation and characterization of UFA-auxotrophs (5Clark D.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 72: 693-707Google Scholar). In the type II system, the double bond is introduced anaerobically into the growing acyl chain at the 10-carbon intermediate by β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP dehydratase, FabA (6Kass L.R. Bloch K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1168-1173Google Scholar). FabA is capable of both the removal of water to generate trans-2-decenoyl-ACP and the isomerization of this intermediate to the cis-3-decenoyl-ACP (3Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: cellular and molecular biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 612-636Google Scholar, 7Bloch K. Acc. Chem. Res. 1968; 2: 193-202Google Scholar). However, FabA is not the only protein that is required for introduction of the double bond and does not catalyze the rate-limiting step in UFA formation (8Clark D.P. de Mendoza D. Polacco M.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5897-5902Google Scholar). A second unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph was isolated that corresponds to the fabB gene, which encodes β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I. In fabB mutants, saturated fatty acid synthesis persists due to the presence of the other elongation condensing enzyme inEscherichia coli, FabF (9D'Agnolo G. Rosenfeld I.S. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 5289-5294Google Scholar, 10Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Google Scholar). Although FabF readily elongates 16:1 to 18:1 (10Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Google Scholar), the inability to support UFA synthesis infabB mutants leads to the conclusion that FabF cannot elongate a key intermediate in UFA biosynthesis (3Cronan Jr., J.E. Rock C.O. Neidhardt F.C. Curtis R. Gross C.A. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E.

Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 1-16Google Scholar). The analysis offabB and fabF mutants, coupled with the catalytic properties of FabB and FabF in vitro supports a function for FabB in UFA synthesis and a role for FabF in the thermal modulation of membrane fatty acid composition (11Gelmann E.P. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 381-387Google Scholar, 12Garwin J.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 1457-1459Google Scholar, 13Ulrich A.K. de Mendoza D. Garwin J.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 221-230Google Scholar, 14de Mendoza D. Cronan Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1983; 8: 49-52Google Scholar). The availability of numerous bacterial genomes sequences allows the reconstruction of type II fatty acid synthase in these organisms using standard bioinformatics analysis tools. It is notable thatfabA and fabB genes occur together in most bacteria that produce UFA (15Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 5982-5990Google Scholar). However, many anaerobes that synthesize UFA, such as the Streptococci and Clostridia, do not have a recognizable fabA homolog in their genomes, and also have afabF rather than a fabB subtype of elongation condensing enzyme. Clearly, UFA are synthesized by a distinct biochemical mechanism in these organisms, and the goal of this study was to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for olefin formation inStreptococcus pneumoniae. Like E. coli, S. pneumoniae produces straight-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids predominately of 16 and 18 carbon chain lengths (16Trombe M.C. Laneelle M.A. Laneelle G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 574: 290-300Google Scholar). Our experiments show that this organism does not utilize a FabA-like mechanism for introducing a double bond into the growing acyl chain, but rather accomplishes this task using a previously unknown enzyme, termed trans-2, cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase (FabM). Reconstitution of the S. pneumoniae UFA synthetic pathway in vitro and in vivo lead to the conclusion that the branch point for UFA synthesis occurs at the enoyl-ACP intermediate, and the amount of UFA produced arises from the competition of FabM and FabK for enoyl-ACP.

Protein was quantitated by the Bradford method (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The Mycobacterium tuberculosis mtFabH, E. coli ecFabD, ecFabG, ecFabA, S. pneumoniae spFabZ, and spFabF proteins were purified as described previously (18Choi K.-H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3032-3040Google Scholar). All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. The fabM gene was amplified from genomic DNA from S. pneumoniae R6. The spfabM PCR primer pair consisted of 5′-AAATAAAAAGGAGCCCATATG and 5′-GGATCCTCAAAGAATGATGCAAG. The primers introduced novel restriction sites for NdeI at the initiator methionine codon of the predicted coding sequence and BamHI downstream of the stop codon. The PCR products were ligated into the plasmid pCR2.1 and sequenced to verify the absence of PCR mutations. The plasmid was isolated and digested with NdeI andBamHI, and the gene fragment was isolated and ligated into plasmid pET-15b digested with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was used to transform strain BL21(DE3) codonplus-RIL strain, and the protein was overexpressed and purified as described previously (20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Google Scholar). Affinity chromatography was followed by gel filtration on Superdex-200 HR 26/60. The enzyme was homogeneous as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apparent molecular weight of FabM was estimated by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex-200 HR10/30 column calibrated with globular protein standards. Cycles of fatty acid elongation were reconstituted in vitro to detect isomerase activity using the purified individual enzymes that catalyze the fatty acid biosynthesis cycle essentially as described previously (20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Google Scholar, 23Choi K.-H. Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 365-370Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained 100 μm ACP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 100 μm NADPH, 100 μm NADH, 50 μm octanoyl-CoA, 100 μm[14C]malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 56 mCi/mmol), mtFabH (1.0 μg/reaction), ecFabD (1.0 μg), ecFabG (1.0 μg), spFabZ (2.3 μg/reaction), ecFabA (2 μg/reaction), spFabF (3 μg) or spFabM (5 μg) in a final volume of 40 μl. The assay mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min and analyzed by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis in 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5m urea. Electrophoresis was performed at 25 °C and 32 mA/gel. The gels were dried, and the bands were quantitated using a phosphorimager screen. Specific activities were calculated from the slopes of the plot of product formation versus protein concentration in the assay. Bands were identified based on the generation of standards as described previously (20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Google Scholar, 21Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10996-11000Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of FabM was addressed by substituting 100 μmeither decanoyl-CoA, lauroyl-CoA, or myristoyl-CoA for octanoyl-CoA in the assay. This assay measures spectrophotometrically the conversion oftrans-2-octenoyl-NAC to cis-3-octenoyl-NAC. A solution containing 100 μm trans-2-octenoyl-NAC in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, was placed in a cuvette, and the substrate concentration was verified by determining the absorbance at 263 nm (ε = 6700 m−1cm−1) (24Seubert W. Lynen F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1953; 75: 2787Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme to 150-μl final volume, and the decrease in absorbance at 263 nm was followed on a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer UV-1601. Each reaction was run in triplicate. One unit is defined as the disappearance of 1 pmol oftrans-2-octenoyl-NAC per min under the defined conditions. Specific activity was expressed as units per microgram of protein. The solutions of acyl-ACP derivatives from the reconstituted assays described above were adjusted to 2% acetic acid, and the protein mass determinations were performed by the Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Approximately 100 pmol of the protein were diluted to 50 μl with 2% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid. The protein was loaded on a C8 reversed phase nano-extraction cartridge (Western Analytical, Murrieta, CA) and washed extensively with the same buffer to remove bound salts. The protein was eluted from the column with 30 μl of 80% acetonitrile, 1% acetic acid and then diluted with 1% acetic acid to a final acetonitrile concentration of 50%. Mass measurements were performed using an LCT electrospray-time of flight spectrometer (Micromass Inc, Beverly, MA) equipped with a Z-spray electrospray interface (Micromass Inc, Beverly, MA). A flow rate of 10 μl/min was maintained using a VLP200 syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and the desalted protein was introduced by loop injection. Data were collected for an m/zrange of 500–2500 at a cone voltage of 35 V and a manual pusher time of 70 μs. All other instrument settings are those typically used for protein measurements on this instrument. Deconvolution of the protein spectrum was accomplished using the maximum entropy algorithm of the MassLynx software (Micromass Inc, Beverly, MA) (25Ferrige A.G. Seddon M.J. Green B.N. Jarvis S.A. Skilling J. Rapid Commun. Mass. Spectrom. 1992; 6: 707-711Google Scholar). Strain JT60 (fabA(Ts)) was unable to grow at the non-permissive temperature (42 °C) unless unsaturated fatty acids (oleate) were supplied or the fabA gene expressed (26Rock C.O. Tsay J.T. Heath R. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5382-5387Google Scholar). The ability of spFabM alone or in conjunction with caFabK to complement thefabA(Ts) phenotype was tested after transformation of JT60 with plasmids carrying either spfabM, cafabK, or both. The same vector (pBluescript KSII(+)) and construction method were used to constitutively express the His-tagged versions of spFabM, caFabK, and ecFabA (20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Google Scholar). The Clostridium acetobutylicum cafabK gene (CAC3576) was amplified from genomic DNA from the ATCC strain 824. The cafabK PCR primers were: 5′-CATATGTTAAAAACTCAGTTTTGTG and 5′-GGATCCCCTATTTAATTCTATCTATAACT. The primers introduced restriction sites for NdeI at the initiator methionine and BamHI downstream of the stop codon. The caFabK protein was expressed from pBluescript and found to substitute for all of the spFabK functions. Like plasmids expressingspfabK (27Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 145-146Google Scholar), cafabK expression restored growth of an E. coli fabI(Ts) mutant at 42 °C, illustrating its function as an enoyl reductase in type II fatty acid synthesis in vivo. Expression of caFabK also conferred triclosan resistance to E. coli. In order to select for the presence of both FabK and FabM, pBluescript vector bearing thecafabK was modified to replace the AmpR gene with a KanR cassette using AvaII andDraIII restriction sites. The pBluescript (empty vector), pfabA (positive control), pfabM, pfabK, or a combination of pfabK/pfabM, pfabK/pfabA were transformed into JT60 and selected with the appropriate antibiotic combinations. Cells were grown at the permissive temperature for the host strain (30 °C), and individual colonies were spotted onto rich broth agar plates without or with 0.15 μg/ml triclosan and incubated at 42 °C. Plates were scored for growth after 24 h at 42 °C. An analysis of the type II fatty acid biosynthetic genes in S. pneumoniae show that they cluster at a single location within the genome (Fig.1). A comparison of the predicted protein sequences of these open reading frames to the known enzymes of E. coli showed that the S. pneumoniae gene cluster lacked both FabI and FabA homologs. Recently, the open reading frame termed fabK (Fig. 1) was demonstrated to encode a novel flavoprotein enoyl-ACP reductase that replaces FabI in theS. pneumoniae type II system (27Heath R.J. Rock C.O. Nature. 2000; 406: 145-146Google Scholar). There are two unknown genes at the end of the cluster of known fatty acid biosynthetic genes. One gene, SP0416, is predicted to encode a helix-turn-helix DNA binding protein of the MarR family that may be a transcriptional regulator involved in controlling the expression of this gene cluster. Adjacent to the transcription factor is the SP0415 open reading frame that is renamed in this work as fabM. Further bioinformatics analysis of the gene cluster reveals a potential connection between the fabM, HTH (SP0416), andfabK genes. The MarR transcription factor is a dimer that utilizes a winged-helix motif to bind a DNA palindrome (28Alekshun M.N. Kim Y.S. Levy S.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1394-1404Google Scholar, 29Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Google Scholar). Often bacterial transcription factors are autoregulated, and their DNA binding motifs are located within their own promoter regions. A DNA palindrome was located in the promoter region of the putative SP0416 transcriptional regulator (Fig. 1). Significantly, this same sequence palindrome is found in the promoters of the fabM andfabK genes (Fig. 1). Unraveling the transcriptional regulation in this large cluster is beyond the scope of this study. The significance of the bioinfomatic analysis is that it tiesfabM to the fatty acid biosynthetic gene cluster and suggests that the fabM and fabK genes may be coordinately regulated. The fabM open reading frame specifies a protein that is a member of the hydratase/isomerase superfamily (Pfam 000378, Ref. 30Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Google Scholar). A comparison of the predicted protein sequence to three members of this superfamily and to the family consensus sequence is illustrated in Fig.2. FabM has a strong similarity to the consensus sequence of Pfam 000378 (Fig. 2) exhibiting 28% identity over the 169-amino acid sequence. This family of enzymes catalyze a wide variety of reactions centered on double bond isomerizations and water addition and elimination at the α,β carbons of thioester substrates. The structures of family members show a common active site design that provides for CoA binding, an expandable acyl chain binding pocket, an oxyanion hole for polarizing the thioester carbonyl, and multiple active site stations for the positioning of acidic and basic amino acid side chains to facilitate proton shuffling (31Xiang H. Luo L. Taylor K.L. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7638-7652Google Scholar). The SP0415 (fabM) open reading frame is annotated in the data base as an enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase. The hydratase/isomerase activity that the data base entry is referring to is associated with the enzymes responsible for either hydrating enoyl-CoA to β-hydroxyacyl-CoA or isomerizing cis-3 to trans-2-enoyl-CoA intermediates in fatty acid β-oxidation. However, S. pneumoniae lacks cytochromes and does not possess enzymes of the β-oxidation pathway making it highly unlikely that FabM functions in this context (32Tettelin H. Nelson K.E. Paulsen I.T. Eisen J.A. Read T.D. Peterson S. Heidelberg J. DeBoy R.T. Haft D.H. Dodson R.J. Durkin A.S. Gwinn M. Kolonay J.F. Nelson W.C. Peterson J.D. Umayam L.A. White O. Salzberg S.L. Lewis M.R. Radune D. Holtzapple E. Khouri H. Wolf A.M. Utterback T.R. Hansen C.L. McDonald L.A. Feldblyum T.V. Angiuoli S. Dickinson T. Hickey E.K. Holt I.E. Loftus B.J. Yang F. Smith H.O. Venter J.C. Dougherty B.A. Morrison D.A. Hollingshead S.K. Fraser C.M. Science. 2001; 293: 498-506Google Scholar). PhaB (PaaB) is an enzyme essential for the catabolism of phenylacetic acid in Pseudomonas putida and is thought to carry out either the hydroxylation or isomerization of the double bonds once the aromatic ring has been opened (33Olivera E.R. Minambres B. Garcia B. Muniz C. Moreno M.A. Ferrandez A. Diaz E. Garcia J.L. Luengo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6419-6424Google Scholar). This protein is part of a multifunctional phenylacetic acid degradation complex and shows 35% identity and 51% similarity to FabM. ChcB is a novel Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase involved in the biosynthesis of the cyclohexanecarboxylic acid moiety of the polyketide ansatrienin A (34Patton S.M. Cropp T.A. Reynolds K.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7595-7604Google Scholar). ChcB has 27% identity and 41% similarity to FabM. FadB is a multifunctional protein involved in fatty acid β-oxidation inE. coli, and contains as one of its activities acis-3-trans-2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (35Yang S.Y. Li J.M. He X.Y. Cosloy S.D. Schulz H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2543-2548Google Scholar). The section of this protein that aligns with FabM is the component of the complex thought to be responsible for the enoyl-CoA isomerase activity required in the degradation of unsaturated fatty acids and over this segment of the protein has a 30% identity and 46% similarity to FabM. These strong similarities to enzymes known to catalyze isomerizations of enoyl thioesters led us to test the hypothesis that FabM encodes atrans-2 to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP isomerase. The FabM open reading frame was cloned into pET-15b, and the His-tagged fusion protein purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified protein has a monomeric molecular size of 31 kDa (Fig.3). Members of the hydratase/isomerase protein family are uniformly multimeric proteins with hexamers of identical subunits being a common configuration, although some members are dimers and tetramers. We therefore examined the size of native FabM by gel filtration chromatography to estimate its aggregation state (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with FabM existing as a tetramer of identical subunits in solution. The ability of FabM to act as an isomerase was tested in a reconstituted fatty acid biosynthetic system designed to detect isomerase activity (Fig.4). Cycles of fatty acid elongation were reconstituted in vitro using purified enzymes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The assay employed the FabH enzyme from M. tuberculosis to generate β-keto[14C]decanoyl-ACP starting with octanoyl-CoA and [2-14C]malonyl-ACP (via ecFabD) as substrates. The NADPH-dependent ecFabG reduced the intermediate to the initial substrate for the assays, β-hydroxy[14C]decanoyl-ACP (Fig.4 A,lane 1). The addition of ecFabA (lane 2) results in the conversion of the β-hydroxy intermediate to a mixture of trans-2- and cis-3-decenoyl-ACPs. These isomeric forms are not distinguished on the gel, but previous work suggests that the trans intermediate would predominate (36Schwab J.M. Klassen J.B. Lin D.C.T. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 121-124Google Scholar). The enoyl-ACP cannot be elongated by a condensing enzyme, but thecis-3 intermediate can. Accordingly, the addition of spFabF, the elongation condensing enzyme of S. pneumoniae, condenses the cis-3-decenoyl-ACP with malonyl-ACP, and following reduction by ecFabG, gives rise to the accumulation of a new band on the gel corresponding to β-hydroxy-cis-5-dodecanoyl-ACP (Fig. 4 A,lane 3). Since this reaction mixture did not contain an enoyl-ACP reductase, additional rounds of elongation cannot occur, and the product accumulates at the 12-carbon stage. Furthermore, ecFabA is characteristically inactive with unsaturated β-hydroxy intermediates (20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Google Scholar), so there is little conversion of the β-hydroxy-cis-5-dodecenoyl-ACP to the trans-2 intermediate. The addition of spFabZ also converts the β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP to the enoyl-ACP (Fig. 4 A,lane 4); however, the addition of spFabF to this reaction did not lead to the appearance of the elongated 12-carbon unsaturated intermediate (Fig. 4, lane 5). These data illustrate that spFabZ is a dehydratase and that it is not capable of isomerizing thetrans-2-enoyl-ACP to the cis-3 intermediate. The addition of FabM to the base reaction did not lead to the formation of enoyl-ACP (Fig. 4 A,lane 6), and in combination with spFabF did not lead to the appearance of any additional products (lane 7). Thus, FabM lacked β-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase activity. The combination of spFabZ and FabM led to the formation of enoyl-ACP (lane 8), but it was not possible to discern if the cis intermediate was formed in this reaction mixture. In the presence of spFabZ, spFabF, and FabM, a new product appeared indicating that cycles of elongation occurred (Fig.4 A,lane 9). This product(s) arises from the elongation of the cis-3 intermediate by spFabF and the dehydration by spFabZ. In contrast to FabA and like ecFabZ (20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Google Scholar), spFabZ was capable of utilizing unsaturated β-hydroxy intermediates to form enoyl-ACPs. These experiments with the reconstituted fatty acid synthase enzymes establish that FabM is capable of isomerizingtrans-2-enoyl-ACP to cis-3-acyl-ACP, but cannot dehydrate β-hydroxyacyl-ACP. In addition, spFabF is capable of elongating cis-3-acyl-ACP intermediates. The reconstituted fatty acid synthase assay is a crude tool for detailed biochemical characterization of an individual enzyme specificity, but we employed this assay to evaluate the substrate specificity of FabM isomerase (Fig. 4, panel B). The mtFabH/FabG/spFabZ system was used to present FabM with different chain length enoyl-ACP substrates. The formation of an elongation product arising from FabM isomerase activity as a function of FabM protein in the assay was used to estimate the activity of FabM. FabM was most active when the 10-carbon enoyl-ACP was presented as the substrate exhibiting a specific activity under these defined conditions of 1.6 ± 0.09 pmol/min/μg. The 12-carbon enoyl-ACP was also utilized in vitro, albeit at a much lower rate (0.4 ± 0.08 pmol/min/μg). We examined 14- and 16-carbon enoyl-ACPs as substrate; however, there was no evidence for isomerization of these longer substrates (not shown). The low activity of mtFabH with hexanoyl-CoA (18Choi K.-H. Kremer L. Besra G.S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28201-28207Google Scholar) did not permit the analysis of FabM activity ontrans-2-octenoyl-ACP using this assay. The specific activity of ecFabA for the 10-carbon substrate under these same assay conditions was 33 ± 1 pmol/min/μg. Thus, FabM was 20-fold less efficient than ecFabA in the formation of cis-double bonds in thein vitro fatty acid synthase assay reconstituted with the indicated constellation of enzymes and the E. coli ACP cofactor. These data are consistent with FabM, like ecFabA (20Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Google Scholar, 37Endo K. Helmkamp Jr., G.M. Bloch K. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4293-4296Google Scholar), being most active on 10-carbon enoyl-ACP, but capable of isomerizing longer chain substrates at a lower rate. The ACP thioester intermediates in the reconstitution assays (Fig. 4 A) were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) to confirm the identities of the products (Fig.5). The major mass peak for the ACP starting material occurred at 8849 with a minor peak at mass 8980 corresponding to the ACP molecules that retained the amino-terminal methionine residue. A new mass peak of 9019 with the expected mass increase of 170 appeared in the β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP starting material (lane 1). The trans-2-andcis-3-decenoyl-ACP mixture (lane 2) formed after dehydration by ecFabA led to the appearance of a new peak at mass 9001 (ACP+152). The elongated product of cis-3-decenoyl-ACP by spFabF was predicted to be the β-hydroxy-cis-5-dodecenoyl-ACP (lane 3), and accordingly the mass spectrum of the mixture contained a new peak at 9044 corresponding to ACP+196. Samples from the reactions inlanes 4 and 5 containedtrans-2-decenoyl-ACP and displayed the expected mass peak at 9001. The β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP precursor (lanes 6 and7) was not converted to other products by FabM, and the predominant acyl-ACP peak in these reactions mixtures was 9019, diagnostic for β-hydroxydecanoyl-ACP (Fig. 5 A). Inlane 8, trans-2- and/orcis-3-decenoyl-ACPs were revealed by the appearance of a characteristic mass peak at 9001. The FabM-catalyzed isomerization of the trans-2 to cis-3-decenoyl-ACP was revealed by the appearance of acyl-ACP products elongated by spFabF (lane 9). Two products were detected as illustrated by the appearance of a peak for cis-5, trans-2-C12:2-ACP (ACP+178) as well as cis-7,cis-5,trans-2-C14:3-ACP (ACP+204) with predicted and observed molecular masses of 9027 and 9053, respectively (Fig.5 B). 2Fatty acid abbrevi"
https://openalex.org/W2089977692,"Mutation of the zebrafish pescadillo gene blocks expansion of a number of tissues in the developing embryo, suggesting roles for its gene product in controlling cell proliferation. We report that levels of the pescadillo protein increase in rodent hepatocytes as they enter the cell cycle. Pescadillo protein localizes to distinct substructures of the interphase nucleus including nucleoli, the site of ribosome biogenesis. During mitosis pescadillo closely associates with the periphery of metaphase chromosomes and by late anaphase is associated with nucleolus-derived foci and prenucleolar bodies. Blastomeres in mouse embryos lacking pescadillo arrest at morula stages of development, the nucleoli fail to differentiate and accumulation of ribosomes is inhibited. We propose that in mammalian cells pescadillo is essential for ribosome biogenesis and nucleologenesis and that disruption to its function results in cell cycle arrest.

We propose that in mammalian cells pescadillo is essential for ribosome biogenesis and nucleologenesis and that disruption to its function results in cell cycle arrest. Pescadillo was first identified in a genetic screen for mutations that affect embryonic development of the zebrafish Danio rerio (1Gaiano N. Allende M. Amsterdam A. Kawakami K. Hopkins N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 7777-7782Google Scholar, 2Allende M.L. Amsterdam A. Becker T. Kawakami K. Gaiano N. Hopkins N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3141-3155Google Scholar). Pescadillo−/− zebrafish mutants can first be identified on developmental day 3 by reduced brain and eye size and a lack of extension of the jaw, possibly caused by the absence of cartilage in the branchial and jaw arches (2Allende M.L. Amsterdam A. Becker T. Kawakami K. Gaiano N. Hopkins N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3141-3155Google Scholar). In addition, the pancreas, gut, and liver fail to expand in pescadillo mutant embryos (2Allende M.L. Amsterdam A. Becker T. Kawakami K. Gaiano N. Hopkins N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3141-3155Google Scholar). Interestingly, the most severely affected organs were those that normally expressed high levels of pescadillo mRNA. Moreover, with the exception of the ovaries, pescadillo mRNA was not detected in adult fish tissues. Together these data imply a cell autonomous role for the pescadillo protein during the proliferation of specific cell types in the fish (2Allende M.L. Amsterdam A. Becker T. Kawakami K. Gaiano N. Hopkins N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3141-3155Google Scholar). Pescadillo is well conserved between species with homologues identified in human (PES1), yeast (YPH1, Nop7p), and mouse (Pes1) (2Allende M.L. Amsterdam A. Becker T. Kawakami K. Gaiano N. Hopkins N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3141-3155Google Scholar, 3Haque J. Boger S. Li J. Duncan S.A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 201-210Google Scholar, 4Kinoshita Y. Jarell A.D. Flaman J.M. Foltz G. Schuster J. Sopher B.L. Irvin D.K. Kanning K. Kornblum H.I. Nelson P.S. Hieter P. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; Google Scholar). Consistent with the zebrafish studies, in situ hybridization analyses in mouse embryos reveal a restricted distribution of pescadillo mRNA with the highest levels being found in the developing liver suggesting that its function is also conserved across species (3Haque J. Boger S. Li J. Duncan S.A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 201-210Google Scholar). Analyses of the predicted amino acid sequence of pescadillo identified the presence of numerous nuclear localization signals, two acidic domains, and a putative SUMO-1 binding site (3Haque J. Boger S. Li J. Duncan S.A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 201-210Google Scholar, 4Kinoshita Y. Jarell A.D. Flaman J.M. Foltz G. Schuster J. Sopher B.L. Irvin D.K. Kanning K. Kornblum H.I. Nelson P.S. Hieter P. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; Google Scholar). In addition, the pescadillo protein was predicted to contain a BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT)-domain. This domain was first described in the breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) and has more recently been found in several proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, and/or recombination (5Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-268Google Scholar, 6Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. Faseb J. 1997; 11: 68-76Google Scholar, 7Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Google Scholar). The presence of a BRCT domain in pescadillo is provocative and implies that the developmental defects suffered by pescadillo mutant zebrafish may be a consequence of the disruption of some aspect of cell proliferation. In support of this proposal, Kinoshita et al. (4Kinoshita Y. Jarell A.D. Flaman J.M. Foltz G. Schuster J. Sopher B.L. Irvin D.K. Kanning K. Kornblum H.I. Nelson P.S. Hieter P. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; Google Scholar) demonstrated that strains ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae harboring mutations in the BRCT domain of the yeast pescadillo gene exhibited delays in cell cycle progression. In addition, the same study demonstrated an increase in expression of pescadillo in malignant astrocytomas and glioblastomas compared with non-malignant tissues, implying that pescadillo may contribute toward tumor progression (4Kinoshita Y. Jarell A.D. Flaman J.M. Foltz G. Schuster J. Sopher B.L. Irvin D.K. Kanning K. Kornblum H.I. Nelson P.S. Hieter P. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; Google Scholar). Recently, biochemical studies in the yeast, S. cerevisaie, have suggested that pescadillo may have a role in controlling ribosome biogenesis and also the onset of DNA replication (8Du Y.C. Stillman B. Cell. 2002; 109: 835-848Google Scholar, 9Adams C.C. Jakovljevic J. Roman J. Harnpicharnchai P. Woolford Jr., J.L. RNA. 2002; 8: 150-165Google Scholar, 10Oeffinger M. Lueng A. Lamond A. Tollervey D. RNA. 2002; 8: 626-636Google Scholar). A requirement in such ubiquitous processes seems surprising given that several cells and tissues develop normally in zebrafish pescadillo mutants. Moreover, this may imply that multicellular organisms have a different use for pescadillo and that any lessons, regarding pescadillo, learned from yeast may not be generally applicable to vertebrates. Although the zebrafish offers many advantages for the generation and screening of mutant phenotypes, analyses of cell and molecular mechanisms are more advanced in other genetically manipulable systems such as rodents. To address the role of pescadillo in controlling mammalian cell proliferation we, therefore, began an analysis of the murine pescadillo homologue. Antibodies against pescadillo were generated commercially (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) using peptides from the amino (N pep, EKKKYERGSAT, amino acids 5–15), middle (M pep, EGQAQAETKISEDTY, amino acids 251–265), and carboxyl regions of pescadillo (C pep, ALEQHRLEEKK, amino acids 494–504). 20 μg of protein from tissue or cell culture lysates were resolved on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer system (BioRad) in CAPS 1The abbreviations used are: CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PNB, prenucleolar bodies; NDF, nucleolus-derived foci; d.p.c., days postcoitum; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end-labeling; eGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methanol, pH 11.3). Blots were probed with anti-PesC (1:1000) or anti-PCNA (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies and visualized by ECL (Pierce). 6–8-week-old female CD-1 mice were anesthetized with tribromoethanol (Avertin) and subjected to two-thirds partial hepatectomy. During this procedure the left and right median and the left lateral lobes were removed. The remaining liver tissue was recovered for immunohistochemical, immunoblotting, and RNA analyses. The integrated density value (IDV) of autoradiographic signals of immunoblots was determined using AlphaImager™ software. Independent immunoblots were normalized by comparing the IDVs of equal amounts of vaccinia-expressed pescadillo protein from each blot. Samples were statistically analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test with six individual animals (n = 6) representing each time point. Following removal of the zona pellucida with acidic Tyrodes solution, embryos were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/PBS then washed in PBS/10 mm glycine, and permeabilized in PBS/0.5% Nonidet P-40. Embryos were treated with 1 mg/ml RNase and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS before incubating with anti-PesC antibody (1:500). Embryos were washed in PBS and incubated with Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were stained using 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide, and fluorescence was visualized using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry as described elsewhere (11Sund N.J. Ang S.L. Sackett S.D. Shen W. Daigle N. Magnuson M.A. Kaestner K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5175-5183Google Scholar). Cell cultures were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, blocked in a 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS solution and incubated with anti-PesC (1:1000), anti-β-tubulin (1:40,000, Sigma), anti-nucleolin (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-B23 (1:50; Zymed Laboratories Inc.) in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The targeting construct (Fig. 5) was created using the pPNT plasmid that contained pgk-neo andHSV-thymidine kinase expression cassettes for positive and negative selection, respectively (12Tybulewicz V.L. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Google Scholar). A 4.5-kb pescadillo genomicClaI fragment, extending from intron 2 through theClaI site of exon 5, was cloned into the EcoRI site of pPNT by blunt-end ligation. A 5.5-kb pescadillo genomicSmaI fragment containing 110 bp of exon 12 and extending 3.3-kb downstream of exon 15 was cloned by blunt-end ligation into theXhoI site of pPNT. Linear targeting vector was electroporated into R1 ES cells. 400 G418/gancyclovir-resistant ES cell clones were collected, and their genotype was determined by Southern blot. PCR genotyping of embryos was performed using a multiplex PCR scheme using the following primers: Pes62 (5′-CCTCTCCACCCTGCAGGTACCCCACATT-3′), Pes3 (5′-CCTACGGCACAACTGAATGGTC-3′), and NeoG (5′-TTAAGGGCCAGCTCATTCCTCCACTCAT-3′). Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 5 min and then 37 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, followed by an extension at 72 °C for 7 min. This PCR yields products of 138 bp for the wild-type pescadillo allele and 281 bp for the mutated allele. Preimplantation embryos were collected and fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in caocodylate buffer. Embryos were transferred to agarose, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy resin. 80–100-nm sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a Hitachi 600 electron microscope. Polyribosomes were identified following the method of Piko and Clegg (13Piko L. Clegg K.B. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 362-378Google Scholar). If pescadillo has a role in controlling cell proliferation we believed it likely that it would be most highly expressed in proliferating tissues. To allow us to test this prediction we generated affinity-purified antibodies to peptides derived from the predicted amino acid sequence from the amino-(PesN), middle- (PesM) and carboxyl-regions (PesC) of the murine pescadillo protein. To confirm that these antibodies could specifically identify pescadillo protein we performed immunoblot analyses using extracts from cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding mouse pescadillo. Fig.1 A shows that the anti-PesC antibody identified a single band in infected cell extracts but not in uninfected cells or in cells infected with control virus. Based on its mobility relative to known M r standards, the protein identified by anti-PesC antibodies was estimated to be around 68 kDa. This is close to the 67.8 kDa that had been calculated through the analysis of the pescadillo predicted primary amino acid sequence. Similar results were obtained with anti-PesN antibodies, however, anti-PesM antibodies were unable to detect the vaccinia-expressed pescadillo protein (data not shown). From these results we were able to conclude that anti-PesC and -PesN antibodies can specifically identify the pescadillo protein. During this analysis we noted that the anti-PesC antibodies were unable to detect any pescadillo protein in uninfected BSC-40 primate cell extracts. In contrast to these data, Kinoshita et al. (4Kinoshita Y. Jarell A.D. Flaman J.M. Foltz G. Schuster J. Sopher B.L. Irvin D.K. Kanning K. Kornblum H.I. Nelson P.S. Hieter P. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; Google Scholar) had detected the human homologue of pescadillo in several human cancer cell lines. When we compared the amino acid sequence of the peptide used to generate the anti-PesC antibodies to the corresponding human sequence we observed that 4 of 11 amino acids were different. This suggested that the anti-PesC antibodies interacted with a pescadillo epitope that was absent from the human homologue. To test this hypothesis we probed immunoblots containing extracts from a variety of primate and mouse cell lines. Fig. 1 B shows that, while anti-PesC antibodies detected pescadillo in all mouse cell lines (Hepa1, NIH3T3, STO, L-cells) tested, no protein was identified in any of the primate cell lines (HeLa, BSC-40, HepG2). These data show that the anti-PesC antibodies are mouse-specific. Having generated antibodies that specifically recognized pescadillo we were able to use them to compare the relative abundance of pescadillo in extracts of tissues that were considered relatively quiescentversus tissues containing a significant number of proliferating cells. Fig. 1 C shows that immunoblot experiments using anti-PesC antibodies detected a 68-kDa band, which co-migrated with the vaccinia virus-expressed pescadillo protein in fetal liver, ovary, testis, and intestine, all of which contain proliferating cells. In contrast, only minimal amounts of the 68-kDa pescadillo protein were identified in adult liver, heart, lung, and kidney. A larger band that appeared to be >110 kDa was identified in some tissues. Whether this represents a modified form of pescadillo is unknown; however, it should be noted that this band was not detected by anti-PesN antibodies. From these results we conclude that pescadillo expression shows a restricted distribution in adult mouse tissues and that all tissues in which the pescadillo protein was detected contain a population of proliferating cells. While the presence of pescadillo in tissues containing proliferating cells was provocative it could easily be coincidental. If pescadillo does indeed contribute to some aspect of cell proliferation we predicted that its expression should be increased as cells transition from quiescent to replicative. 60% of the liver cell mass consists of hepatocytes, which under normal conditions are quiescent with mitosis observed in ∼1 in every 20,000 hepatocytes (14Steer C.L. Faseb J. 1995; 9: 1396-1400Google Scholar). However, when a portion of the liver tissue is surgically removed the remaining hepatocytes proliferate to restore normal liver mass (15Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Google Scholar, 16Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-187Google Scholar). We, therefore, performed partial hepatectomies on mice to test whether pescadillo expression was up-regulated as hepatocytes left G0 and entered the cell cycle. Livers were collected from sham-operated mice or liver remnants from hepatectomized mice at 0, 16, 36, 40, 44, 48, and 72 h after surgery. Liver tissue obtained from six mice at each time point was processed for immunoblot analysis using anti-PesC antibodies. A representative immunoblot shown in Fig.2 A, and statistical analyses shown in Fig. 2 B, demonstrate that pescadillo protein levels increase beginning at 16-h posthepatectomy and continue to climb until they plateau at around 40-h posthepatectomy. Expression of pescadillo was found to precede that of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which is a marker of S-phase. In agreement with BrdUrd labeling studies performed by others, PCNA expression was first identified in liver remnants at 36 h and reached maximal levels at 44-h posthepatectomy (17Ye H. Holterman A.X. Yoo K.W. Franks R.R. Costa R.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8570-8580Google Scholar, 18Weglarz T.C. Sandgren E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12595-12600Google Scholar). The finding that pescadillo expression precedes that of PCNA implies that pescadillo expression is induced during the G1 phase of the first cell cycle after surgery. We confirmed the immunoblot data by immunohistochemical analyses of liver sections taken from the same experiment. Fig. 2 C shows that anti-Pes antibodies gave diffuse background staining throughout the liver in sham-operated mice and in liver remnants collected immediately after hepatectomy. By 16-h posthepatectomy faint nuclear staining could be detected in the liver remnants, which increased in intensity at 40- and 44-h posthepatectomy. Surprisingly, at 48-h postsurgery staining was reproducibly detectable but diffuse, possibly due to cells entering mitosis, before returning to a nuclear staining pattern at 72 h. Cumulatively, these data demonstrate that expression of pescadillo is up-regulated as quiescent cells enter the cell cycle and support the hypothesis that pescadillo plays a role in cell proliferation. Careful analysis of the subcellular location of pescadillo should help decipher its function. Previously, we had identified the presence of several nuclear localization motifs within the predicted amino acid sequence of pescadillo and had demonstrated that epitope-tagged pescadillo protein localized to the nucleus when expressed in cultured hepatoma cells (3Haque J. Boger S. Li J. Duncan S.A. Genomics. 2000; 70: 201-210Google Scholar). To determine whether the endogenous protein was also nuclear and to address whether its subcellular location changed during the cell cycle we performed immunostaining on NIH3T3 cells (Figs.3 and4).Figure 4Pescadillo is associated with the chromosome periphery, nucleolus-derived foci, and prenucleolar bodies during mitosis. NIH3T3 cells were synchronized by release from serum starvation and processed for immunocytochemistry using anti-PesC antibodies (green,A–H,J andL), and antibodies against tubulin (red,E–H), nucleophosmin (red,I andL), and counterstained with DAPI (blue,E–H,K, and L). Pescadillo staining was identified during prophase (pro;A andE), metaphase (met; B andF), anaphase (ana;C and G) and telophase (tel;D, H–L). During metaphase and anaphase pescadillo was seen to associate with the periphery of condensed chromosomes (white arrow) and was found in cytoplasmic nucleolus-derived foci (cyan arrow) and in prenucleolar bodies (bar) in the nucleus during telophase. p, pescadillo; d, DAPI;t, β-tubulin; b, nucleophosmin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When NIH3T3 cells were analyzed using anti-PesC antibodies, pescadillo was found to co-localize with the DAPI-stained cell nuclei (Fig. 3,A and B). As expected, BSC-40 primate cells did not react with the anti-PesC antibodies demonstrating that the nuclear labeling seen in NIH3T3 cells accurately identified the location of pescadillo protein and was not due to any cross reactivity of the antibody (Fig. 3, C and D). At higher magnification it was clear that pescadillo was distributed in distinct domains throughout the nucleus (Fig. 3 E). The largest of these domains resembled nucleoli and so we compared the location of pescadillo to nucleolin, a characteristic nucleolar protein. Fig. 3,E–H show that both pescadillo and nucleolin co-localize in the largest spots, indicating that pescadillo is present within the nucleoli. This is consistent with previous work that found pescadillo in the nucleoli of HeLa cells (4Kinoshita Y. Jarell A.D. Flaman J.M. Foltz G. Schuster J. Sopher B.L. Irvin D.K. Kanning K. Kornblum H.I. Nelson P.S. Hieter P. Morrison R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; Google Scholar). Of note, in addition to the prominent nucleolar staining, we also identified several smaller dots within the nucleoplasm that reacted solely with the anti-PesC antibody indicating they were distinct from the nucleolus (Fig. 3,E–H). We initially used an asynchronous cell population in our analysis of pescadillo distribution. However, we noted that pescadillo was still present, although nucleoli are absent, in mitotic cells. We therefore analyzed the location of pescadillo protein at various stages of mitosis in a population of NIH3T3 cells made synchronous by release from serum starvation (Fig. 4). As the chromosomes condensed during mitosis, pescadillo protein appeared as nebulous accumulations within the dissipating cell nucleus (Fig. 4, A and E). These regions of intense pescadillo staining did not coincide with the centrosomes or spindle apparatus, as was demonstrated in Fig.4 E by co-staining prophase cells with anti-β-tubulin antibodies. Fig. 4, B and F represent a polar view of the metaphase plate showing condensed chromosomes stained with DAPI, anti-PesC, and anti-β-tubulin antibodies. In metaphase cells pescadillo appeared to closely associate with the condensed chromosomes, localizing to distinct stripes that appeared to coat the outside of the chromosomes. This staining of the chromosome periphery persisted during anaphase, although additional distinct spots of pescadillo staining could also be seen in the vicinity of the spindle poles (Fig. 4, C and G). As the nuclear envelope reformed during telophase these spots were localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, D and H). Punctate staining could also be seen within the nucleus during cytokinesis, although this staining was relatively less intense compared with that of the cytoplasmic dots (Fig. 4, D and H). The dynamic distribution of pescadillo during mitosis was reminiscent of several proteins and rRNAs with roles in nucleolar assembly and ribosome biogenesis (19Dundr M. Olson M.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2407-2422Google Scholar, 20Dundr M. Misteli T. Olson M.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 433-446Google Scholar). The nucleolus is disassembled early in mitosis and then reformed during late mitotic stages in a process that is dependent upon repression and the subsequent re-activation of RNA polymerase I-mediated transcription (21Olson M.O. Dundr M. Szebeni A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 189-196Google Scholar, 22Melese T. Xue Z. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 319-324Google Scholar). During this procedure molecules involved in ribosome biogenesis and nucleolar assembly distribute to defined locations within the mitotic cell. Some localize to the periphery of chromosomes (perichromosomal sites) early in mitosis, then become associated with prenucleolar bodies (PNBs) that are present within nascent nuclei during telophase (20Dundr M. Misteli T. Olson M.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 433-446Google Scholar, 21Olson M.O. Dundr M. Szebeni A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 189-196Google Scholar, 23Hernandez-Verdun D. Gautier T. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 179-185Google Scholar, 24Gautier T. Dauphin-Villemant C. Andre C. Masson C. Arnoult J. Hernandez-Verdun D. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 5-15Google Scholar, 25Gautier T. Fomproix N.

Others are present within discrete cytoplasmic particles called nucleolus-derived foci (NDF) that arise transiently during anaphase and disappear by G1 (20Dundr M. Misteli T. Olson M.O. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 433-446Google Scholar). To determine whether the distinct spots of pescadillo staining in the telophase nucleus and cytoplasm were PNBs and NDFs, respectively, we co-stained mitotic cells using anti-nucleophosmin (also called B23) antibodies, which recognize these nucleolar-related structures (27Dundr M. Meier U.T. Lewis N. Rekosh D. Hammarskjold M.L. Olson M.O. Chromosoma. 1997; 105: 407-417Google Scholar). Fig. 4, I–L shows that anti-nucleophosmin and anti-PesC antibodies recognize the same structures within cells during telophase. Overall, we conclude that pescadillo is associated with all structures, nucleoli, decondensing chromosomes, NDFs, and PNBs, which have roles in reassembly of the nucleolus following mitosis. The data presented above suggested a role for pescadillo in controlling cell proliferation, possibly by being required for ribosome biogenesis or nucleolus formation. To directly test this proposal we attempted to generate pescadillo (pes)−/− mice using the strategy shown in Fig.5. A successful gene-targeting event in ES cells was predicted to replace the final 158 bp of exon 5 through 110 bp of exon 12 with a cassette containing a neomycin phosphotransferase gene expressed from the phosphoglycerate kinase promoter (pgk-neo). Southern blot analysis identified 2 ES cell clones, one of which is shown in Fig. 5 B that contained a correctly targeted pescadillo allele. Chimeric mice were produced from both cell lines but only one gave rise to chimeras that transmitted the mutant pescadillo allele through their germline.pes +/− mice were viable, having lifespans in excess of 19 months, and exhibited no obvious abnormal phenotype. If pescadillo were essential for cell proliferation, we predicted thatpes −/− embryos would be unlikely to survive past the earliest stages of development. We, therefore, interbredpes +/− mice and determined the genotype of offspring and postgastrulation stage embryos by Southern blot analysis. Table I shows that of 126 offspring 41 were pes +/+ and 85 werepes +/−. No pes −/− mice were recovered, demonstrating that pescadillo is essential for embryonic development. Analysis of embryos collected from 7.5–10.5 d.p.c. (not shown) found no pes −/− embryos nor sites of re-adsorption. We next developed a PCR-based assay to genotype preimplantation stage embryos. Fig.6 A shows that oligonucleotide primers designed to hybridize to pgk-neo or flanking genomic pescadillo nucleotide sequences (Fig. 5 A) could be used in a PCR to differentiate between pes +/+,pes +/−, and pes −/−embryos. Of 182 blastocyst stage embryos collected 49 werepes +/+, 109 were pes +/−, and 24 were pes −/−. Similarly, of 104 embryos at the morula stage of development 31 werepes +/+, 57 were pes +/−, and 16 were pes −/−. These results demonstrate that, while pes −/− morulae could be identified, the frequency at which they were recovered was non-Mendelian indicating that approximately half of thepes −/− embryos arrested at an even earlier stage of development.Table IGenotypes of offspring and embryos resulting from Pes+/−crossesStageGenotypeTotal+/++/−−/−2.5 d.p.c.3157161043.5 d.p.c.49109241827.5 d.p.c.13380513 week postnatal41850126 Open table in a new tab Comparisons of pes +/+,pes +/−, and pes −/−morulae, shown in Fig. 6 B, revealed no striking morphological differences, although often the blastomeres of the mutant morulae appeared to be less organized than in control embryos. Morulae of all genotypes appeared to contain the same number of blastomeres and had successfully undergone compaction (the process by which the outermost blastomeres of the morula become polarized). However, striking differences were observed between control andpes −/− embryos as they formed blastocysts. At 3.5 d.p.c. control embryos had progressed from a compacted morula to a blastocyst containing an identifiable inner cell mass, trophectoderm, and blastocoel cavity. In contrast, allpes −/− embryos examined (n = >50) contained only 8–16 cells, which is the number of cells seen in wild-type morulae at 2.5 d.p.c., and none of thepes −/− embryos had formed blastocysts. While the 3.5 d.p.c. pes −/− embryos strongly resembled morulae the individual blastomeres appeared disorganized, often being misshapen and having a granular appearance (Fig.6 B). We saw no significant increase in TUNEL staining in the mutants compared with controls (data not shown) suggesting that apoptotic cell death of the blastomeres was not a major cause of the phenotype. We, therefore, conclude that the primary defect associated with loss of pescadillo is a failure of the blastomeres to proliferate past morula stages of development. To begin to understand why proliferation was blocked inpes −/− blastomeres, we characterized the expression and localization of the pescadillo protein during the development of wild-type preimplantation embryos using confocal microscopy (Fig. 7). Prior to the 8-cell stage, expression of pescadillo could be faintly identified in ∼50% of embryos examined using anti-PesC antibodies. In interphase blastomeres of 2- and 4-cell stage embryos pescadillo expression was restricted to a subnuclear band that encircled one or more large vacu"

Several mammalian tRNA synthetases form a macromolecular protein complex with three auxiliary factors, p43, p38, and p18 (1Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

However, the structure and function of this complex have not been fully understood. Although the component enzymes make specific protein-protein interactions via their non-catalytic peptide appendices (4Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K. Jo Y.J. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 21768-21772Google Scholar), the assembly and stability of the whole complex are mainly contributed to by one of the three cofactors, p38 (8Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Google Scholar), which is in contact with many components of the complex (9Quevillon S. Robinson J.-C.

Because components dissociated from the multi-ARS complex were subjected to degradation process, at least one function of the complex formation appears to be the maintenance of the cellular stability of the complex-forming enzymes and cofactors (8Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Google Scholar). The structure and activity of another complex-associating factor, p43, have been most extensively studied. It was proposed to be located in the center of the complex (11Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17921-17924Google Scholar) and binds arginyl-tRNA synthetase (12Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Google Scholar) to facilitate the catalysis of the enzyme. Surprisingly, p43 itself is also secreted to work on immune cells and triggers pro-inflammatory response (14Ko Y.-G. Park H. Kim T. Lee J.-W. Park S.G. Seol W. Kim J.E. Lee W.-H. Kim S.-H. Park J.E.

In addition, it showed a potential to interact with the α subunit of ATP synthase (16Chang S.Y. Park S.G. Kim S. Kang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8388-8394Google Scholar), which was previously shown to mediate anti-angiogenic activity of angiostatin (17Moser T.L. Stack M.S. Asplin I. Enghild J.J. Hojrup P. Everitt L.

In addition, the C-terminal domain shares homology with the equivalent part of mammalian tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase that is processed to function as two distinct cytokines (20Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Google Scholar). Another class I tRNA synthetase, tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase, also showed potent angiostatic activity (21Wakasugi K. Slike B.M. Hood J. Otani A. Ewalt K.L. Friedlander M. Cheresh D.A. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 173-177Google Scholar). All of these previous reports led us to expect that the secreted p43 may play an important role in angiogenesis as well as in the inflammation process. Here we investigated the activity of p43 in angiogenesis using variousin vitro and in vivo models and found that p43 shows dose-dependent biphasic activity in angiogenesis. Bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAECs) were isolated from descending thoracic aortas and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. The primary cells used in this study were between passages 5 and 10. Ac-YVAD-pNA, Ac-DEVD-pNA, and z-DEVD-fmk were purchased from Calbiochem, and PD98059, SB203580, and SB202190 were purchased from BIOMOL. The antibodies specific to three mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK, were obtained from New England BioLabs. JNK dominant negative mutant (JNK-DN) and Jun-binding domain (JBD) of Jun-interacting protein were kind gifts from Dr. E. J. Choi (Korea University, Korea). A Transwell chamber for the endothelial cell migration assay and VEGF were purchased from Corning and R&D systems, respectively. p43 (312 aa) and its N (146 aa)- and C (166 aa)-terminal domains were expressed as His tag fusion protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified by nickel affinity and Mono S ion-exchange chromatography (14Ko Y.-G. Park H. Kim T. Lee J.-W. Park S.G. Seol W. Kim J.E. Lee W.-H. Kim S.-H. Park J.E. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23028-23033Google Scholar). To remove lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the protein solution was dialyzed in pyrogen-free buffer (10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 100 mm NaCl). After dialysis, the p43 solution was loaded to polymyxin resin (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer, incubated for 20 min, and eluted. To further remove residual LPS, the protein solution was dialyzed against PBS containing 20% glycerol and filtered with Posidyne membrane (Pall Gelman laboratory). The concentration of the LPS in p43 was below 20 pg/ml as determined by using the Limulus Amebocyte lysate QCL-1000 kit (BioWhittaker). The activity of p43 in angiogenesis was determined using various in vitro and in vivoassays. For chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay, fertilized chick eggs were incubated in the humidified egg breeder at 37 °C. On the third day of incubation, about 2 ml of egg albumin was removed by an 18-gauge hypodermic needle to detach the developing CAM from the shell. After the incubation for an additional 6 days, Thermanox coverslips (Nunc) loaded with 0, 0.1, or 1 μg of p43 were placed on the CAM surface, and the remodeling of vascularization was observed after 3 days. The total length of blood vessels within the area of the coverslips was determined by Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). For tube formation assay, BAECs (5 × 105 cells) were cultivated on Matrigel in the presence of 0, 1, or 100 nm p43 at 37 °C for 18 h. The changes of cell morphology were then captured by phase-contrast microscopy. For the in vitro cell migration assay, the cultivated BAECs were wounded with a razor blade and incubated in the media containing 0, 1, or 100 nm p43. The cells were allowed to migrate for 16 h, then fixed with absolute methanol and stained with Giemsa. The BAEC migration assays were performed by using a Transwell chamber (24-well chamber) with polycarbonate membranes (8.0-μm pore size, Costar) as described with slight modifications (22Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23155-23159Google Scholar). The wells were coated with 0.5 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline and allowed to air-dry. BAECs were suspended in serum-free DMEM and added to the upper chamber at 2–5 × 104 cells per well. A chemotactic stimulus, VEGF (0.7 nm), or one of the indicated concentrations of p43 was placed in the lower chamber, and the cells were allowed to migrate for 7 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After incubation, non-migrant cells were removed from the upper face of the membrane with a cotton swab. The migrant cells (those attached to lower face) were fixed in 100% methanol and visualized by the hematoxylin (Sigma) staining. The migrant cells were counted in high power fields. The in situ apoptosis detection was performed by using the ApoptagTM fluorescein kit (Oncor) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Apoptotic nuclei were visualized by using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad MRC 1024). To determine the degradation of chromosomal DNA into the nucleosome-sized fragments, a 500-μl aliquot of the lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2m NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) was added to the cell pellet (2 × 105 cells) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. DNA was obtained by consecutive 1.5 mNaCl and ethanol precipitation, treated with RNase (200 μg/ml), separated in a 1.8% agarose gel, and visualized under UV light. For the caspase assay, BAECs (2 × 106 cells) were treated with or without p43 (100 nm) for 16 h and then lysed with 300 μl of the chilled cell lysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fractions were used to measure the activities of caspase-1 and -3. The protein extracts (40 μg) of the cell lysates were incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 100 μm caspase-3 substrate, Ac-DEVD-p-nitroanilide, or the caspase-1 substrate, Ac-YVAD-p-nitroanilide. The amount ofp-nitroaniline released by the caspase activation was quantitated by the optical density at 405 nm. BAECs treated with different concentrations of p43 were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with the lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The proteins in the lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Antigens were visualized by sequential treatment with specific antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate kit. JNK immunocomplex in vitro kinase assay was performed as described previously (23Ko Y.G. Kang Y.S. Park H. Seol W. Kim J. Kim T. Park H.S. Choi E.J. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39103-39106Google Scholar). BAECs were seeded onto six-well plates in DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and cultured to 70–80% confluency. The cells were then washed two times with DMEM with 2% fetal bovine serum and cultured for additional 2 h, and then p43 was added at the indicated concentrations. After 24 h, the media were collected and mixed with 5× FOD buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8). The samples were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE with the gel containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma). After electrophoresis, the gel was washed two times with 2.5% Triton X-100, briefly with distilled water, and incubated with the reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 μmZnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.002% sodium azide) overnight at 37 °C. The gel was stained with 0.2% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained with 35% methanol. Reverse transcription reaction was performed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The primer sequences for MMP9 cDNA were 5′-GGCAGCTGGCAGAGGAATACCTGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTGGCGCACCAGCGGTAGCCGTC-3′ (reverse). The primer sequences for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA were 5′-TCATTGACCTCAACTACATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCAAAGTTGTCATGGATGAC-3′ (reverse). The reaction mixture was first denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and the PCR condition was 94 °C/1 min, 55 °C/1 min, and 72 °C/1min for 25 cycles, followed by 72 °C for 5 min. For gene transfection, BAECs were grown overnight in six-well plates and washed in Hanks' buffered salt solution prior to transfection using the method of adenovirus conjugated to polylysine as described previously (24Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Google Scholar). Empty vector (pcDNA3.1) or the vector expressing JNK-DN or JBD (2 μg) were transfected into BAECs along with 2 μg of the vector expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein, and expressed for 24 h. The transfected cells were treated with p43 (20 nm) for 24 h, and then cell death was determined by counting the apoptotic cells using fluorescence microscopy. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by dividing the number of green cells with apoptotic morphology with the total number of green cells. Empty vector was used as the control and gave about 15% or less apoptotic cells. The activity of p43 in angiogenesis was determined by several different experiments. In the chorioallantoic membrane assay, the coverslips loaded with the different amounts of p43 were placed on the surface of the membrane. In eight out of ten tested eggs, blood vessels were attracted to the area to which the low dose of p43 (0.1 μg) was spotted, whereas this effect was not observed at the high dose (1 μg) (Fig. 1 A). The total length of the blood vessel within the area of the coverslip was ∼2.2-fold increased with 0.1 μg of p43 but about 0.3-fold decreased with 1 μg of p43 compared with the control. The effect of p43 on tube formation was tested on Matrigel. BAECs were cultivated on Matrigel containing different amounts of p43. The stimulation of tube formation was observed at 1 nm but not at 100 nm p43 (Fig.1 B). Third, the activity of p43 was also tested by wound migration assay. In this assay, the cultivated BAECs were scraped with a razor blade and then allowed to migrate in the presence of different concentrations of p43. The cell migration was enhanced at 1 nm but not at 100 nm p43 (Fig.1 C). Finally, the chemotactic activity of p43 on BAECs was tested using the Transwell migration system. Different amounts of p43 were added to the lower chamber, and the cells migrating from the upper to lower chamber were counted. The migrated cells were stained with hematoxylin, and the cell counting was performed in high power fields. The cell migration was increased to about 4-fold at 1 nm p43, but the effect of p43 was decreased at the concentrations higher than 1 nm (Fig. 1 D). Thus, all of these experimental results suggest that p43 may induce the endothelial cell migration but the effect is dose-sensitive. As shown above, the stimulatory effect of p43 on the endothelial cell migration was abolished as its concentration was increased. We have already shown that the endothelial cell proliferation was blocked at high concentrations of p43 (16Chang S.Y. Park S.G. Kim S. Kang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8388-8394Google Scholar). Here we investigated whether p43 can induce the death of the endothelial cells at high concentration using BAECs. The effect of p43 on the death of BAECs was monitored by the cell morphology and other typical markers for apoptosis. The number of apoptotic cells was dramatically increased from 10 nm p43 (Fig.2 A). The endothelial cell death was further confirmed at 100 nm p43 by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining, DNA laddering, and the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 2, B,C, and D, respectively). All of the results indicate that p43 may induce apoptosis of the endothelial cells at high concentration. We have previously shown that p43 activates three major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in monocytes (14Ko Y.-G. Park H. Kim T. Lee J.-W. Park S.G. Seol W. Kim J.E. Lee W.-H. Kim S.-H. Park J.E. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23028-23033Google Scholar, 15Park H. Park S.G. Lee J.-W. Kim T. Kim G. Ko Y.-G. Kim S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2002; 71: 223-230Google Scholar). Thus, we tested whether these kinases are also affected by p43 in the endothelial cells. The activity changes of these proteins were monitored after BAECs were treated with different concentrations of p43. Although all of the three kinases were activated by p43, they responded to different concentrations of p43 (Fig. 3). Although ERK was activated from 0.5 nm p43, the activation of JNK was apparent from 10 nm. The activity of p38 MAPK was increased only at 100 nm p43. Based on this result, we expected that ERK and JNK could be involved in the p43-induced migration and apoptosis of the endothelial cells, respectively. Because the endothelial cell migration and the activation of ERK occurred at similar concentration of p43 (about 1 nm), we investigated whether ERK mediates the induction of the endothelial cell migration by p43. The activities of ERK and p38 MAPK were suppressed by the treatment of their specific inhibitors, PD98059 and SB203580, respectively. BAECs were incubated with each of these inhibitors in the upper chamber of the Transwell membrane system, and the cell migration was induced with 1 nm p43 in the lower chamber. The cell migration was specifically inhibited by the treatment of PD98059, suggesting that ERK is responsible for the p43-induced cell migration (Fig.4 A). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) secreted by endothelial cells are considered to play a key role in the processes of the matrix remodeling and endothelial cell migration during angiogenesis (25Fisher C. Gilbertson-Beadling S. Powers E.A. Petzold G. Poorman R. Mitchell M.A. Dev. Biol. 1994; 162: 499-510Google Scholar, 26Schnaper H.W. Grant D.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Fridman R. D'Orazi G. Murphy A.N. Bird R.E. Hoythya M. Fuerst T.R. French D.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 235-246Google Scholar). Particularly the gelatinases, MMP2 and MMP9, capable of degrading native collagen type IV that is the major constituent of basement membranes, are involved in the vascular cell migration and invasion (27Kraling B.M. Wiederschain D.G. Boehm T. Rehn M. Mulliken J.B. Moses M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1599-1609Google Scholar, 28Puyraimond A. Weitzman J.B. Babiole E. Menashi S. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1283-1290Google Scholar). Because we used the gelatin-coated membrane for the Transwell cell migration assay (Fig. 1 D), we tested whether these two proteinases are involved in the p43-induced cell migration. The activities of these two enzymes were determined by their ability to digest gelatin in the gel matrix as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The activity of MMP9 was dramatically enhanced at 1 nm p43 and decreased at the higher concentrations, whereas MMP2 gradually decreased as the concentration of p43 was increased (Fig. 4 B). To see whether the p43-induced MMP9 is responsible for the cell migration, BAECs were treated with different amounts of anti-MMP9 antibody (26Schnaper H.W. Grant D.S. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Fridman R. D'Orazi G. Murphy A.N. Bird R.E. Hoythya M. Fuerst T.R. French D.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 156: 235-246Google Scholar), and the cell migration was induced by 1 nmp43. The cell migration was blocked by the treatment of anti-MMP antibody in a dose-dependent manner while mock antibody did not give a significant effect (Fig. 4 C), indicating that MMP9 is directly involved in the p43-induced cell migration. To determine the functional linkage of MMP9 and ERK in the p43-induced cell migration, the activity of ERK and the expression and activation of MMP9 were determined in BAECs treated with 1 nm p43. As expected, the activation of ERK by p43 was blocked with PD98059 and but not with SB203580 (Fig. 4 D), consistent with the effect of PD98059 on the p43-induced cell migration (Fig. 4 A). The expression and activity of MMP9 were monitored by RT-PCR and zymography, respectively. p43 enhanced both of the expression and activity of MMP9, and the stimulatory effect was also blocked by PD98059 (Fig. 4 D). Thus, the p43-induced endothelial cell migration is mediated by MMP9 that is induced and activated by ERK. p43 induced apoptosis of endothelial cells and activated JNK from 10 nm (Figs. 2 and 3). Here we investigated whether JNK is responsible for the p43-induced apoptosis. To address this question, we used SB202190 that inhibits p38 MAPK at 10 μm and blocks both p38 MAPK and JNK at 40 μm (29Jacinto E. Werlen G. Karin M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 31-41Google Scholar, 30Porter C.M. Havens M.A. Clipstone N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3543-3551Google Scholar). BAECs were pretreated with each concentration (10 or 40 μm) of SB202190, PD98059, and the caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk, and subsequently with 20 nm p43. The induction of apoptosis was determined by cell morphology and the activation of caspase-3. Although the p43-induced apoptosis was not affected by the treatment of SB202190 (10 μm) or PD98059, it was inhibited by the pre-treatment of SB202190 (40 μm) or z-DEVD-fmk (Fig. 5 A). The activity of JNK was determined by the phosphorylation of GST-Jun as the reaction substrate. The phosphorylation of c-Jun was completely inhibited only with SB202190 (40 μm) among different inhibitors (Fig. 5 B). These results suggest that JNK, but not p38 MAPK and ERK, should be involved in the p43-induced apoptosis. To confirm the involvement of JNK in the p43-induced apoptosis more specifically, we used JNK-binding domain (JBD) of JNK-interacting protein 1 or JNK dominant negative form of JNK (JNK-DN), which can block the activity of JNK (31Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Google Scholar, 32Harding T.C. Xue L. Bienemann A. Haywood D. Dickens M. Tolkovsky A.M. Uney J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4531-4534Google Scholar). JNK-DN and JBD were expressed in BAECs by adenoviral transfection as determined by immunoblotting (data not shown). Whereas about 45% of BAECs were turned to apoptotic cells by p43, the effect of p43 was blocked by the expression of JBD or JNK-DN (Fig. 5 C). These results clearly indicate that JNK mediates the p43-induced apoptosis of the endothelial cells. We have previously shown that the various truncated p43 fragments retained the activity inducing tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-8 (14Ko Y.-G. Park H. Kim T. Lee J.-W. Park S.G. Seol W. Kim J.E. Lee W.-H. Kim S.-H. Park J.E. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23028-23033Google Scholar). To determine whether the biphasic activity of p43 on endothelial cells can be separated, depending on the peptide region, we have prepared the 146-aa N-terminal and 166-aa C-terminal domains of p43 and compared them with the full-length p43 in the induction of endothelial cell migration and death. In the endothelial cell migration, all of the three polypeptides showed a dose-dependent curve (Fig.6 A). However, the maximum effect on the cell migration was shown at 10 nm of the C-terminal domain of p43 but at 1 nm of the full-length p43 and its N-terminal domain. All of the three polypeptides showed the activity inducing endothelial cell death in dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 B). In both cases, the full-length p43 showed the highest activity, although all of the three polypeptides showed the similar pattern of the activity. These results suggest that the activities for the endothelial cell migration and apoptosis are not separable by the different domains of p43, but its whole structure is involved for the full activity. p43 is cleaved upon apoptosis to generate its C-terminal domain, which was previously called endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP II) (13Shalak V. Kaminska M. Mitnacht-Kraus R. Vandenabeele P. Clauss M. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23769-23776Google Scholar, 33Quevillon S. Agou F. Robinson J.-C. Mirande M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32573-32579Google Scholar). For this reason, p43 has been considered as the precursor for the cytokine, EMAP II. However, we have recently shown that p43, and not EMAP II, is secreted to work as a pro-inflammatory cytokine (14Ko Y.-G. Park H. Kim T. Lee J.-W. Park S.G. Seol W. Kim J.E. Lee W.-H. Kim S.-H. Park J.E. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23028-23033Google Scholar). Nonetheless, EMAP II itself showed a potent anti-angiogenic activity inducing apoptosis of endothelial cells (34Berger A.C. Alexander H.R. Tang G. Wu P.S. Hewitt S.M. Turner E. Kruger E. Figg W.D. Grove A. Kohn E. Stern D. Libutti S.K. Microvasc. Res. 2000; 60: 70-80Google Scholar,35Schwarz M.A. Kandel J. Brett J. Li J. Hayward J. Schwarz R.E. Chappey O. Wautier J.L. Chabot J. Lo Gerfo P. Stern D. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 341-354Google Scholar). In this work, we found that p43 can induce the migration as well as death of the endothelial cells in a dose-dependent manner (Figs. 1 and 2). Interestingly, both of the N- and the C-terminal EMAP II domains also showed dose-dependent bell-shaped activity in the induction of endothelial cell migration as the full-length p43, although their activities were lower than the full-length p43 (Fig. 6 A). Thus, the two distinct activities on endothelial cells do not seem to be determined by different structural units but rather dispersed throughout the polypeptide of p43. The p43-dependent signal pathway leads to the activation ERK and MMP9 that is responsible for the endothelial cell migration (Figs. 2 and 4). This result is consistent with the previous reports that the ERK activation is required to induce MMP9 in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells (36Genersch E. Hayess K. Neuenfeld Y. Haller H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4319-4330Google Scholar, 37Khan K.M. Falcone D.J. Kraemer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2353-2359Google Scholar). However, p43 showed little, or very weak if any, effect on the endothelial cell proliferation at concentrations lower than 10 nm (data not shown). Instead, the proliferation of the endothelial cells is inhibited by p43 at higher concentrations (Ref.16Chang S.Y. Park S.G. Kim S. Kang C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8388-8394Google Scholar). 2S. G. Park, Y.-S. Kang, Y. H. Ahn, S. H. Lee, K.-R. Kim, K.-W. Kim, G. Y. Koh, Y.-G. Ko, and S. Kim, unpublished data. Thus, the pro-angiogenic activity of p43 appears to result mainly from its capability of inducing migration of the endothelial cells. The MMP9 activity was significantly decreased at 100 nm p43 (Fig. 4 B), whereas ERK still remained active (Fig. 3). In addition, MMP9 was still weakly induced and activated when the ERK activity was completely inhibited by the treatment of 20 μm PD98059 (Fig. 4 D). Likewise, the endothelial cell migration was not completely blocked when the ERK activity was blocked with 20 μm PD98059 or with anti-MMP9 antibody (Fig. 4, A and C). All of these results implicate that the other signal pathways independent of ERK should be also involved in the endothelial cell migration induced by p43. p43 also caused apoptosis of the endothelial cells (Fig. 2) via JNK (Fig. 5). It is known that JNK is involved in apoptosis induced by various stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor, ceramide, irradiation, or heat shock (31Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Google Scholar, 38Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar, 39Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Google Scholar). The involvement of JNK in apoptosis of the endothelial cells has been also reported previously (40Ho F.M. Liu S.H. Liau C.S. Huang P.J. Lin-Shiau S.Y. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2618-2624Google Scholar). Although the treatment of SB202190 (40 μm) completely blocked the JNK activity (Fig. 5 B), apoptosis of the endothelial cells still occurred at a little higher rate than the p43-untreated cells (Fig. 5 A). Thus, JNK does not appear to be the only mediator for the JNK-induced apoptosis of the endothelial cells. Angiogenesis is a complex biological process that is determined by the combined effect of multiple factors with different activities. For this reason, the effect of a specific protein factor on angiogenesis may be determined by the balance with other factors near the responding endothelial cells. The biphasic mode of activity in a single protein appears to give an additional complexity in the regulation of angiogenic process. The biphasic activity has been also reported in other signaling molecules such as transforming growth factor-β1 (41Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Orci L. Montesano R. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 356-363Google Scholar), thrombospondin-1 (42Pazouki S. Pendleton N. Heerkens E. Smither R.L. Moore J.V. Schor A.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 368SGoogle Scholar), and estrogen (43Banerjee S.K. Campbell D.R. Weston A.P. Banerjee D.K. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1997; 177: 97-105Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanism to control their activities may vary, the dual mode of the activity appears to be required for the fine control of angiogenesis. Although we have previously shown that the N-terminal domain of p43 is responsible for its secretion (14Ko Y.-G. Park H. Kim T. Lee J.-W. Park S.G. Seol W. Kim J.E. Lee W.-H. Kim S.-H. Park J.E. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23028-23033Google Scholar), it does not have any clear sequence motif for secretion. Interestingly, the same domain in p43 is also involved in its association with the multi-ARS complex (12Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Google Scholar). Also, p43, if not associated with the complex, appears to be unstable in the cell (8Kim J.Y. Kang Y.S. Lee J.W. Kim H.J. Ahn Y.H. Park H. Ko Y.G. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7912-7916Google Scholar). Thus, the activity and cellular turnover of p43 appears to be under complex control. It would be interesting to see whether p43 is secreted independently of the multi-ARS complex or is first held within the multi-ARS complex and then secreted upon appropriate condition or signal."

Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Google Scholar, 7Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Google Scholar). Mucins, the major component of mucus secretions, are high molecular weight and heavily glycosylated proteins synthesized by the mucosal epithelial cells lining the middle ear, trachea, digestive, and reproductive tracts (8Kim W.D. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 1914-1917Google Scholar). They protect the epithelial surface by binding and trapping inhaled infectious particles, including bacteria and viruses, for mucociliary clearance, at least in part because of the extraordinary diversity of their carbohydrate side chains (6Knowles M.R. Boucher R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 571-577Google Scholar, 9Rose M.C. Nickola T.J. Voynow J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 533-537Google Scholar). However, in patients with OM with effusion and COPD whose mucociliary clearance mechanisms have become defective, excessive production of mucin will lead to airway obstruction in COPD and conductive hearing loss in OM with effusion (8Kim W.D. Eur. Respir. J. 1997; 10: 1914-1917Google Scholar,10Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. McNamara N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 1999; 160: S44-S48Google Scholar, 11Carrie S. Hutton D.A. Birchall J.P. Green G.G. Pearson J.P. Acta Otolaryngol. 1992; 112: 504-511Google Scholar). To date, 14 mucin genes have been identified (9Rose M.C. Nickola T.J. Voynow J.A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 533-537Google Scholar, 10Basbaum C. Lemjabbar H. Longphre M. Li D. Gensch E. McNamara N. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care. Med. 1999; 160: S44-S48Google Scholar, 12Kim Y.S.

Among these, at least MUC2, MUC5AC, andMUC5B have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of respiratory infectious diseases. Understanding the signaling mechanisms underlying up-regulation of mucin may open up novel therapeutic targets for these diseases. In contrast to the relatively well known mechanism by whichMUC5AC mucin is up-regulated by NTHi (14Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Google Scholar), the signaling mechanism underlying NTHi-induced MUC2 mucin transcription remains totally unknown. Based on our previous studies showing thatMUC2 is up-regulated by Gram-negative bacteriumPseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis via activation of NF-κB (15Li J.D. Dohrman A. Gallup M. Miyata S. Gum J. Kim Y. Nadel J. Prince A. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 967-972Google Scholar, 16Li J.D. Feng W.J. Gallup M.G. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Google Scholar) and that NTHi, also a Gram-negative bacterium, strongly activates NF-κB (17Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar), it is plausible that activation of NF-κB might be also required for NTHi-induced MUC2up-regulation via specific signaling pathways. In addition to the NF-κB pathway, the TGF-β-Smad pathway represents another important signaling pathway participating in regulation of diverse biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, death, inflammatory, and immune responses (18Derynck R. Feng X.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Google Scholar, 19Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Google Scholar, 20Piek E. Heldin C.H. Ten Dijke P. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 2105-2124Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 21Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 22Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Google Scholar, 23Hill C.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 533-540Google Scholar, 24Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 3-5Google Scholar). The TGF-β superfamily is a large group of secreted growth factors of which three subgroups have been defined: the TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphonegetic proteins (BMPs) (21Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar, 23Hill C.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 533-540Google Scholar). TGF-β initiates signaling through the ligand-dependent activation of a heteromeric complex of type II and type I receptors. The type II receptor kinase then phosphorylates the type I receptor in a conserved glycine-serine domain (GS domain), resulting in activation of the type I receptor. The activated type I receptor subsequently recognizes and phosphorylates the Smad subgroup known as receptor-activated Smads (R-Smad), including Smad2 and Smad3. This causes dissociation of R-Smad from the receptor, stimulates the assembly of a heteromeric complex between the phosphorylated R-Smad and the Co-Smad, Smad4, and then induces the translocation of the Smad complex to the nucleus, where the Smad complex regulates the expression of target genes (19Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Google Scholar, 21Massague J. Wotton D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1745-1754Google Scholar). In addition to its direct interaction with Smad DNA-binding element (SBE), growing evidence suggests that Smads also regulate gene transcription by direct interaction and functional cooperation with other transcription factors, such as NF-κB (25Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Google Scholar, 26Lopez-Rovira T. Chalaux E. Rosa J.L. Bartrons R. Ventura F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28937-28946Google Scholar, 27Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5178-5193Google Scholar). Despite its important role in regulation of diverse biological processes, it is still unclear if activation of the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway also mediates up-regulation of mucin, a primary host innate defensive response to bacteria. Because of the important role of NF-κB and TGF-β signaling in mediating diverse cellular responses as well as the reported functional cooperation between NF-κB and TGF-β-Smad, we hypothesized that the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway cooperates with NF-κB to mediate up-regulation of MUC2 mucin transcription in response to NTHi infections in human epithelial cells. Here, we show that activation of TGF-β receptor-Smad3/4 signaling, together with TLR2-MyD88-TAK1-NIK-IKKβ/γ-IκBα-dependent activation of NF-κB, mediates NTHi-induced MUC2 mucin transcription. These findings provided direct evidence, for the first time, that the bacterium NTHi uses the TGF-β-Smad pathway for transducing signals into nucleus, at least in part, via an autocrine-independent mechanism and that the functional cooperation between NF-κB and TGF-β receptor-Smad is required for host defensive response to NTHi. These studies may bring insights into the novel role of TGF-β-Smad signaling in bacterial pathogenesis and may lead to novel therapeutic intervention for OM and COPD. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and MG-132 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Recombinant human TGF-β1 and TGF-β neutralization antibody were purchased from R&D Systems. NTHi strain 12, a clinical isolate, was used in this study (14Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Google Scholar, 17Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J.

Linthicum F. Guan Y.L. Han J. Cato A.C. Lim D.J. Akira S. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17263-17270Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown on chocolate agar at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. For making NTHi crude extract, NTHi were harvested from a plate of chocolate agar after overnight incubation and incubated in 30 ml of brain heart infusion (BHI) broth supplemented with NAD (3.5 μg/ml). After overnight incubation, NTHi were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The resulting pellet of NTHi was suspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated. Subsequently, the lysate was collected and stored at −70 °C. NTHi lysates (5 μg/ml) were used in all the experiments. We chose to use NTHi lysates because of the following reasons: First, NTHi has been shown to be highly fragile and has the tendency to autolyse. Its autolysis can be triggered in vivo under various conditions including antibiotic treatment (14Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Google Scholar,17Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar, 28Shuto T.

Therefore, using lysates of NTHi represents a common clinical condition in vivo, especially after antibiotic treatment. Human colon epithelial cell line HM3 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) (14Wang B. Lim D.J. Han J. Kim Y.S. Basbaum C.B. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 949-957Google Scholar, 16Li J.D. Feng W.J. Gallup M.G. Gum J. Kim Y. Basbaum C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5718-5723Google Scholar). Human cervix epithelial cell line HeLa and human middle ear epithelial cell line HMEEC-1 were maintained as described (17Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc.

Akira S. Li J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17263-17270Google Scholar). Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). NHBE cells were maintained in Clonetics' recommended bronchial epithelial growth media (BEGM), which includes supplements of bovine pituitary extract, hydrocortisone, human recombinant epidermal growth factor, epinephrine, transferrin, insulin, retinoic acid, triiodothyronine, gentamicin, and amphotericin B (Clonetics), to a confluence of 60–80% (37 °C, 5% CO2). Media were replaced every other day. Only cells at passages 4 were used for experiments. Wild-type mink Mv1Lu cells and two cell lines, DR26 and R1B that are derived from Mv1Lu and lack functional TβRII and TβRI, respectively, were kindly provided by Dr. Joan Massague (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York), and were maintained as described previously (29Laiho M. Weis M.B. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18518-18524Google Scholar). Wild-type rat Rat-1 cells and a cell line R5 that is derived from Rat-1 and lacks functional IKKγ were maintained as described previously (30Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Google Scholar). All media received additions of 100 units/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin. Total RNA was isolated from human epithelial cells using TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. For the real-time quantitative RT-PCR, predeveloped TaqMan assay reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used. Synthesis of cDNA from total RNA samples was performed with MultiScribeTM reverse transcriptase. To normalize MUC2 expression relative to cDNA, we used primers and a TaqMan probe corresponding to cyclophilin. Expression of MUC2 was measured relative to cyclophilin. Primers and the TaqMan probe for MUC2 and cyclophilin were designed by using Primer Express software (Applied Biosystems) and synthesized by Applied Biosystem Customer Oligo Synthesis Service (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan probes were labeled with FAM on the 5′-end and TAMARA on the 3′-end. The primers and probes for MUC2 were: forward primer, 5′-TCCATCCTGCTGACCATCAA-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GTAGGCATCGCTCTTCTCAATGA-3′, and TaqMan probe, 5′-FAM-TGACACCATCTACCTCACCCGCCATAMRA-3′. Reactions were amplified and quantified using an ABI 7700 sequence detector and manufacturer's software (Applied Biosystems). Relative quantity ofMUC2 mRNA was obtained using Comparative CT Method (for details, see user Bulletin 2 for the ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System under www.appliedbiosystems.com/support/tutorials) and was normalized using predeveloped TaqMan assay reagent human cyclophilin as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems). The expression plasmids IκBα(S32A/S36A), IKKα(K44M), IKKβ(K49A), IKKγ, NIK (K429A/K430A), TAK1 DN, MyD88 DN, hTLR2 DN, ΤGFβRIIDN and wild-type, ΤGFβRI DN and wild-type, Smad2 DN, Smad3DN and wild-type, Smad4 DN and wild-type were previously described (17Shuto T.

The reporter constructs, 5′-flanking region of the humanMUC2 gene, NF-κB-luc, SBE-Luc, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)-Luc, were also previously described (16Li J.D. Feng W.J.

All transient transfections were carried out in HM3 cells in triplicate using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus, Medison, WI) following the manufacturer's instruction, unless otherwise indicated. In all co-transfections with either a wild-type or a dominant-negative mutant of signaling molecules, an empty vector was used as a control. Transfected cells were pretreated with or without chemical inhibitors including CAPE and MG-132 for 2 h. NTHi or recombinant human TGF-β1 was then added to the transfected cells 42 h after transfection. After 5 h, the cells were harvested for luciferase assay. In experiments using neutralization TGF-β antibody, NTHi lysates were pretreated with either TGF-β neutralization antibody or control antibody for 1 h before being added to the transfected cells for 5 h. Cells were cultured on 4-chamber microscope slides. After NTHi treatment, the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde solution (4%), incubated with mouse anti-p65 NF-κB or mouse anti-Smad4 monoclonal antibodies for 1 h (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Primary antibody was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Samples were viewed and photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Antibodies against phospho-IκBα(Ser-32), IκBα were purchased from Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA). Antibodies against phospho-TβRII (Tyr-336) and TβRII were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phosphorylation of IκBα and TβRII were detected as described and following the manufacturer's instructions (17Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar). TGF-β1, 2, and 3 released from the cells were analyzed by standard sandwich ELISA assays using ELISA kits as described and following the manufacturer's instructions. TGF-β1 ELISA kit was purchased from BioSource Europe S. A. (Nivelles, Belgium). TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 ELISA kits were purchased from the R&D system. We first examined whether NTHi up-regulates MUC2mucin expression in human epithelial cells by performing real-time quantitative PCR analysis. NTHi strongly up-regulates MUC2expression at mRNA level in human epithelial HM3 cells (Fig.1 A). To investigate whether transcriptional regulation is involved in MUC2 induction, we next transfected HM3 cells with an expression vector containing 2.8 kb of the human MUC2 5′-flanking region fused to a luciferase reporter gene. When we exposed the transfected cells with NTHi, the luciferase activity driven by the MUC2 promoter increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of transcriptional regulation (Fig. 1 B and data not shown). Because we were interested in the potential generality of NTHi-induced MUC2 up-regulation, we assayed a variety of human epithelial MUC2-expressing cell lines as well as primary cells. Results from HeLa, HM3, HMEEC-1, and NHBE cells are shown in Fig. 1, C and D. Interestingly, NTHi-induced up-regulation of MUC2 expression at both transcriptional and mRNA levels is well conserved among all human epithelial cell lines and primary epithelial cells that we tested. Thus, these findings indicate that NTHi up-regulatesMUC2 mucin transcription in human epithelial cells. We next performed experiments to define the NTHi-response element in the 5′-flanking region of the humanMUC2 mucin gene and the related transcription factors in the HM3 cell, the human epithelial cell line yielding the strongest NTHi response. Analysis of luciferase activity from a panel of deletion mutants of the MUC2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene revealed a NTHi response element between base pairs −1528 and −1430 (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). Subsequent sequence analysis showed that this region contains a NF-κB binding site. Based on our recent report showing that NTHi strongly activates NF-κB (17Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar), we next explored the possibility that activation of NF-κB is required for NTHi-induced MUC2transcription by performing selective mutagenesis of the NF-κB binding site. As shown in Fig. 2 A, mutant constructs M1, M2, and M3, in which the NF-κB site is mutated, markedly reduced the responsiveness of MUC2 promoter construct, whereas mutant construct M4 in which NF-κB site remains intact did not reduceMUC2 induction. These results suggested that NF-κB activation is required for NTHi-induced MUC2 transcription. Because nuclear translocation is a key step for NF-κB to exert its transcriptional activity, we next sought to determine whether NF-κB nuclear translocation is also required for MUC2 induction. As shown in Fig. 2 B (upper panel), p65, a key subunit of NF-κB complex, was translocated into the nucleus upon exposure to NTHi as we reported previously in HeLa cells. The NTHi-induced NF-κB translocation was blocked by a chemical inhibitor CAPE, which is known to specifically block the translocation of p65 without affecting IκBα degradation (Fig. 2 B, upper panel) (34Natarajan K. Singh S. Burke Jr., T.R. Grunberger D. Aggarwal B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9090-9095Google Scholar). Moreover, CAPE abrogated NTHi-induced MUC2transcription (Fig. 2 B, lower panel), confirming that nuclear translocation and activation of NF-κB is indeed required for NTHi-induced MUC2 transcription. Based on our recent report that TAK1-NIK-IKKβ-dependent IκBα phosphorylation and degradation is required for NTHi-induced NF-κB activation, we next sought to determine the involvement of IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in MUC2 induction (17Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar). We first investigated whether NTHi induces IκBα phosphorylation and degradation in HM3 cells. As shown in Fig.2 C (upper panel), phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα was observed in HM3 cells treated with NTHi. The NTHi-induced IκBα degradation was blocked by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor that prevents the degradation of IκBα (35Neish A.S. Gewirtz A.T. Zeng H. Young A.N. Hobert M.E. Karmali V. Rao A.S. Madara J.L. Science. 2000; 289: 1560-1563Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylated IκBα was no longer degraded in the presence of MG-132 and thus persists in the cytoplasm. We next sought to determine the requirement of IκBα degradation by assessing the effect of MG132 on NF-κB nuclear translocation and MUC2 induction. As expected, MG132 completely blocked NTHi-induced NF-κB translocation in HM3 cells (Fig. 2 C, middle panel). Concomitantly, MUC2 induction was also inhibited by MG132 (Fig. 2 C, lower panel). Moreover, overexpression of a transdominant mutant of IκBα (S32A/S36A) greatly inhibitedMUC2 induction, further confirming the involvement of IκBα degradation in MUC2 induction (36Beauparlant P. Kwon H. Clarke M. Lin R. Sonenberg N. Wainberg M. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5777-5785Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of either IKKβ or NIΚ or TAK1, but not IKKα, markedly inhibited MUC2induction (Fig. 2 D). Consistent with these results, R5, a cell line that is derived from Rat-1 cells and lacks functional IKKγ, did not show NTHi-induced transcriptional activation from both the NF-κB-driven promoter and MUC2 promoter (30Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F. Kirk H.E. Kay R.J. Israel A. Cell. 1998; 93: 1231-1240Google Scholar). Their responsiveness to NTHi could be rescued by co-transfection of wild-type IKKγ in R5 cells, similarly to the response of wild-type Rat-1 cells (Fig. 2 E). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that NTHi induces MUC2 up-regulation via a TAK1-NIK-IKKβ/γ-dependent IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, which, in turn, leads to NF-κB nuclear translocation and activation. Having identified TAK1-NIK-IKKβ/γ-IκBα-dependent activation of NF-κB involved in NTHi-induced MUC2transcription, still unknown is which cell surface receptor(s) is involved in transmitting signals from cell surface to the cytoplasm inMUC2 induction. Because of the important role of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in mediating bacteria-induced NF-κB activation (17Shuto T. Xu H. Wang B. Han J. Kai H. Gu X.X. Murphy T. Lim D.J. Li J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8774-8779Google Scholar), we sought to first determine the involvement of TLR2 in NTHi-induced MUC2 transcription. As shown in Fig.2 F, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of human TLR2 inhibited MUC2 induction. Similarly, co-transfection with a dominant-negative mutant MyD88, a key adaptor protein downstream of TLR2, also inhibited MUC2 induction (37Horng T. Medzhitov R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12654-12658Google Scholar). These data indicate that the TLR2-MyD88 signaling pathway is also involved inMUC2 induction. Because NTHi is a major bacterial pathogen causing middle ear and airway infections, we next determined whether this signaling pathway also mediates NTHi-induced MUC2 transcription in HMEEC-1 and NHBE. As shown in Fig. 2 G, overexpressing dominant-negative mutants of IκBα, IKKβ, TAK1, MyD88, and TLR2 inhibits NTHi-induced MUC2 transcription in both HMEEC-1 (left panel) and NHBE cells (right panel). Thus, it is clear that NTHi-induced MUC2 up-regulation via the TLR2-MyD88-TAK1-NIK-IKK-IκBα-NF-κB signaling pathway is also well conserved in the relevant human middle ear and bronchial epithelial cells. To further confirm whether the endogenous MUC2 gene andMUC2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene are similarly up-regulated, we evaluated the effects of overexpressing dominant-negative mutants of several key signaling molecules identified above, including IκBα, TAK1, and MyD88. All these treatments inhibited NTHi-induced up-regulation of MUC2 mRNA, confirming that the TLR2-MyD88-TAK1-NIK-IKK-IκBα-NF-κB signaling pathway revealed by luciferase reporter gene assays are indeed responsible for induction of endogenous MUC2 gene expression by NTHi (Fig. 2 H). Because of the important role of TGB-β signaling in regulation of diverse cellular responses, we were interested in determining whether TGF-β receptor signaling is also required for NTHi-induced MUC2 transcription. We first examined if NTHi activates TGF-β-Smad signaling by evaluating NTHi-induced nuclear translocation of Smad4, a key step for Smad3/4 complex to exert its transcriptional activity (18Derynck R. Feng X.-H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F105-F150Google Scholar), As seen in Fig.3 A, it is evident that NTHi potently induces nuclear translocation of Smad4. As expected, Smad4 translocation was also induced by TGF-β1. To further confirm whether NTHi activates TGF-β-Smad-dependent transcriptional activity, we assessed the effect of NTHi on SBE-dependent promoter activity by using SBE luciferase reporter (38Shi Y. Wang Y.F. Jayaraman L. Yang H. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1998; 94: 585-594Google Scholar) and TGF-β-responsive promoter activity of a PAI-1-Luc in HM3 cells (39Keeton M.R. Curriden S.A. van Zonneveld A.J. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23048-23052Google Scholar). When we exposed the transfected cells to NTHi or TGF-β1, SBE-driven luciferase activity greatly increased in cells treated with NTHi or TGF-β1 (Fig. 3 A), confirming that NTHi indeed activates the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway. Next, we investigated the requirement of TGF-β signaling in NTHi-induced MUC2transcription by overexpressing dominant-negative mutant of TβRII (27Feng X.-H. Lin X. Derynck R.

NF-SLN cDNA (SLN tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope) was introduced into rat soleus muscle in one hindlimb by plasmid injection and electrotransfer. Western blotting showed expression and co-immunoprecipitation showed physical interaction between NF-SLN and SERCA2a. Contractile properties and SERCA2a function were assessed and compared with vector-injected contralateral soleus muscles. NF-SLN reduced both peak twitch force (P t) (123.9 ± 12.5 versus 69.8 ± 8.9 millinewtons) and tetanic force (P o) (562.3 ± 51.0versus 300.7 ± 56.9 millinewtons) and reduced both twitch and tetanic rates of contraction (+dF/dt) and relaxation (−dF/dt) significantly. Repetitive stimulation (750-ms trains at 50 Hz once every 2 s for 3 min) showed that NF-SLN increased susceptibility to fatigue. These changes in contractile function were observed in the absence of endogenous phospholamban, and NF-SLN had no effect on either SERCA2a or SERCA1a expression levels. NF-SLN also decreased maximal Ca2+transport activity at pCa 5 by 31% with no significant change in apparent Ca2+ affinity (6.36 ± 0.07versus 6.39 ± 0.08 pCa units). These results show that NF-SLN expression impairs muscle contractile function by inhibiting SERCA function and diminishing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores.

Sarcolipin (SLN) 1The abbreviations used are: SLN, sarcolipin; SERCA, sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; PLN, phospholamban; NF-SLN, sarcolipin tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: SLN, sarcolipin; SERCA, sarco (endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase; PLN, phospholamban; NF-SLN, sarcolipin tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. is a 31-amino acid transmembrane protein which co-purifies with the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a) (1MacLennan D.H. Yip C.C. Iles G.H. Seeman P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 469-478Google Scholar, 2Wawrzynow A. Theibert J.L. Murphy C. Jona I. Martonosi A. Collins J.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 620-623Google Scholar). Like SERCA1a, SLN is expressed highly in both human and rabbit fast twitch muscle and to a lower extent in slow twitch and cardiac muscle, where phospholamban (PLN) and SERCA2a are highly expressed (3Fujii J. Lytton J. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 227: 51-55Google Scholar), and in trace amounts in pancreas and prostate (4Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Google Scholar). In rat, however, the pattern of expression is different (5Gayan-Ramirez G. Vanzeir L. Wuytack F. Decramer M. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 387-397Google Scholar), because SLN is expressed to a low extent in fast twitch extensor digitorum longus muscle and nearly 18-fold higher in both diaphragm (mixed fast and slow) and cardiac muscles. Our initial studies indicated that SLN decreased the apparent affinity of SERCA1a for Ca2+ and increased maximal transport activity at high Ca2+ concentrations (6Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Google Scholar). Our more recent studies have confirmed that co-expression of NF-SLN with SERCAs in HEK-293 cells decreases the apparent affinity of both SERCA1a and SERCA2a for Ca2+ but did not confirm that NF-SLN increases maximal transport activity of SERCA1a in high Ca2+ (7Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar). The apparent increase in maximal transport activity of SERCA1a observed earlier (6Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Google Scholar) could be explained by an underestimate in the enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay used in that study to measure the amount of SERCA1a (7Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar). NF-SLN was found to be a more effective inhibitor of SERCA2a than of SERCA1a, being almost equal to PLN in its ability to decrease apparent Ca2+ affinity and, in contrast to PLN, even decreasing maximal transport activity at pCa 5 (7Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar). PLN is a well characterized regulator of SERCA2a activity in cardiac muscle (8Simmerman H.K. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Google Scholar). Inhibitory interactions between PLN and SERCA2a result in a decrease in the apparent affinity of SERCA2a for Ca2+ (9Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21726-21731Google Scholar) with no effect on the maximal rate of Ca2+ uptake by SERCA2a (7Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar, 10Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Khanna V.K. Busch H.F. Karpati G. Jablecki C.K. Breuning M.H. MacLennan D.H. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 191-194Google Scholar, 11Morris G.L. Cheng H.C. Colyer J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11270-11275Google Scholar). Inhibitory interactions can be reversed by elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ or by phosphorylation of Ser16 and Thr17 in PLN cytosolic domain 1A (12Simmerman H.K. Collins J.H. Theibert J.L. Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13333-13341Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that PLN is a major regulator of left ventricular basal contractile parameters and their responses to β-agonists (13Sham J.S. Jones L.R. Morad M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1344-H1349Google Scholar, 14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Google Scholar, 15Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Google Scholar, 16Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W. II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Google Scholar). Ablation of PLN is associated with significant increases in cardiac contractility and left ventricular systolic function (14Luo W. Grupp I.L. Harrer J. Ponniah S. Grupp G. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 401-409Google Scholar, 15Koss K.L. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1059-1063Google Scholar), whereas the 2-fold overexpression of wild-type PLN in transgenic mice had an inhibitory effect on both the kinetics of Ca2+ transients and contractile parameters in ventricular myocytes and impaired basal left ventricular systolic function in vivo (16Kadambi V.J. Ponniah S. Harrer J.M. Hoit B.D. Dorn G.W. II Walsh R.A. Kranias E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 533-539Google Scholar). Structural similarities betweenSLN and PLN genes and SLN and PLN protein sequences indicate that the two genes are members of a family (4Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Scherer S.W. Beatty B. Khanna V.K. Cornblath D.R. Chaudhry V. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Karpati G. Breuning M.H. Knoers N. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1997; 45: 541-553Google Scholar). The physiological function of SLN has not been evaluated, either in skeletal muscle or in cardiac muscle. Because NF-SLN and PLN affect SERCA2a function in a similar fashion in vitro, it is likely that SLN and PLN would affect muscle contractility in a similar fashion. In this study, we expressed NF-SLN in rat soleus muscle by intramuscular injection and electrotransfer of rabbit NF-SLN cDNA to explore the possibility that SLN can regulate SERCA2a activity and slow twitch soleus muscle contractility just as PLN can regulate cardiac contractility. We found that NF-SLN reduces peak isometric force, slows the rates of contraction and relaxation, and increases susceptibility to fatigue. Ca2+ uptake in postnuclear homogenates from these muscles was also impaired. We propose that NF-SLN can impair muscle contractile function indirectly by inhibiting SERCA function and thus lowering basal Ca2+ stores in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Enzymes for DNA manipulation were from New England Biolabs and Pharmacia Corp., and the expression vector pcDNA3.1 was from Invitrogen. Protein G-Sepharose and a chemiluminescence kit for measurement of co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were from Pierce. FLAG antibody M2 and the monoclonal antibody 5C5 against α-sarcomeric actin were from Sigma; the anti-PLN antibody 1D11 (17Mayer E.J. Huckle W. Johnson Jr., R.G. McKenna E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 40-48Google Scholar) was a gift from Dr. Robert Johnson (Merck Research Laboratories); the monoclonal antibody 2A7-A1 against SERCA2a and SERCA2b was from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. The A52 monoclonal antibody against SERCA1 was produced in our laboratory (18Zubrzycka-Gaarn E. Phillips L. MacLennan D.H. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1984; 168: 19-23Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed on total RNA isolated from soleus and heart using guanidium-isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction (19Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar), the latter being included as a positive marker for SLN becauseSLN is expressed highly in rat heart (5Gayan-Ramirez G. Vanzeir L. Wuytack F. Decramer M. J. Physiol. 2000; 524: 387-397Google Scholar). RNA quality and quantity were determined by absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. A 5-μg aliquot of total RNA was reverse transcribed in 20 μl of a reaction mix (Sigma Enhanced Avian HS reverse transcription-PCR kit) containing 20 units of eAMV reverse transcriptase at 42 °C in the presence of RNase inhibitor and 1 μm specific SLN reverse primer (SLN, 5′-GGG AGT GAC TGC TGT GTG CCC T-3′). The polymerase chain reaction was carried out in a total volume of 50 μl with JumpStart AccuTaq LA DNA polymerase mix (Sigma), with 200 μm dNTPs, 0.4 μm each of the appropriate 5′ and 3′ primers (SLN, forward, 5′-GGT GTG CAC TCA GAA GTC CTC CT-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGG AGT GAC TGC TGT GTG CCC T-3′) and 5 μl of first strand cDNA. Denaturation was for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing was at 63 °C for 1 min, and extension for 35 cycles was at 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified products were separated on 1.2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The culture of HEK- 293 cells, their transfection with cDNAs encoding SERCA1a, SERCA2a, and NF-SLN, and the isolation of microsomal fractions from transfected cells expressing these proteins have been described in earlier publications (6Odermatt A.

The preparation of the rabbit NF-SLN cDNA construct was described previously (6Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Google Scholar). NF-SLN is a fusion protein of SLN with a FLAG epitope at its N terminus that does not alter its function (6Odermatt A. Becker S. Khanna V.K. Kurzydlowski K. Leisner E. Pette D. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12360-12369Google Scholar). The NF-SLN construct was cloned into theXbaI and XhoI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3.1. Injection and electric pulse delivery of the NF-SLN cDNA construct into rat soleus muscle was achieved using the protocol of Mir et al.(22Mir L.M. Bureau M.F. Gehl J. Rangara R. Rouy D. Caillaud J.M. Delaere P. Branellec D. Schwartz B. Scherman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4262-4267Google Scholar). Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 339 ± 12 g (n = 8) were fully anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (50–100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg). After achieving full anesthesia, each soleus muscle was exposed and injected with a total of 150 μg of DNA dissolved in 0.9% sterile NaCl (0.5 μg/μl) using a 26G 0.5 stainless steel needle. For each animal, the soleus muscle from the experimental hindlimb was injected with NF-SLN, and the soleus muscle from the contralateral control hindlimb was injected with an equal concentration of the expression vector pcDNA3.1. Approximately 1 min after DNA injection, electric pulses (9 pulses, 2 Hz, 200 V/cm, 20 ms/pulse) were applied by two implanted stainless steel needle electrodes (21G 1.5) connected to a Grass stimulator (Grass S88). Following electroporation, incisions in the skin directly covering each soleus muscle were closed using surgical staples, and the animals were allowed to recover under a heat lamp. Three days after DNA injection, electrically evoked muscle force was assessed in situ from the soleus muscle from each hindlimb across a range of stimulation frequencies from 1 to 70 Hz. The rats were anesthetized initially using a mixture of ketamine (50–100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg) and given maintenance intraperitoneal injections of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg), as required. All other details pertaining to the surgical preparation and the animal stimulation apparatus have been described elsewhere (23Chin E.R. Green H.J. Grange F. Dossett-Mercer J. O'Brien P.J. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1995; 73: 1154-1164Google Scholar,24Carvalho A.J. McKee N.H. Green H.J. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1997; 99: 163-171Google Scholar). Soleus muscles contracted isometrically (i.e. length remained constant), and both twitch (1 Hz) and tetanic (10–70 Hz) force were obtained via direct muscle stimulation, with the use of stainless steel electrodes and with a single 0.2-ms pulse at 70 V. Muscle stimulation was performed using a Grass S88 stimulator, and force data were collected on-line using a 640A signal interface (Aurora Scientific Inc.) connected to a National Instruments 16-bit A/D card and analyzed using the Dynamic Muscle Control and Data Acquisition (DMC) and Dynamic Muscle Analysis (DMA) Software (Aurora Scientific Inc.). An independent calibration was performed daily for each force transducer (Grass, model FT 10). At least 5 min before commencing data collection, optimal length (L o) for peak twitch force (P t) was established. Peak tetanic force (P o) occurred at a stimulation frequency of 50 Hz, and only P t and P odata are reported here, including peak force amplitude and peak rates of contraction (+dF/dt) and relaxation (−dF/dt). To assess the effects of NF-SLN on soleus susceptibility to fatigue, each muscle was stimulated repeatedly for 3 min using a fatigue protocol consisting of 700-ms contractions at 50 Hz, once every 2 s. Fatigue data are expressed as percentages of resting data. Experimental protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the University of Toronto. Immediately after muscle contractile measurements, soleus muscles were excised, weighed, and diluted 10-fold (w/v) in homogenizing buffer containing 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm sucrose, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmdithiothreitol and homogenized with a Tissumizer (Tekmar Company, TR-10) at 90% maximal power with two 30-s bursts. The homogenates were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen for later analysis. Just prior to analysis, the homogenates were thawed on ice and centrifuged at 1,700 × g in an Eppendorf 5415C centrifuge (Brinkman Instruments Ltd.) for 5 min to sediment nuclei and cell debris. The postnuclear homogenate was assessed for protein concentration using the Bio-Rad method with bovine serum albumin as a standard and was used for all subsequent analyses, unless otherwise stated. Western blotting was performed to determine the relative expression levels of NF-SLN, PLN, SERCA2a, and SERCA1a (25Chu G. Luo W. Slack J.P. Tilgmann C. Sweet W.E. Spindler M. Saupe K.W. Boivin G.P. Moravec C.S. Matlib M.A. Grupp I.L. Ingwall J.S. Kranias E.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1064-1076Google Scholar) in rat soleus muscles that were either injected with NF-SLN or the expression vector pcDNA3.1. After assuring linearity of band density, 20 μl (20 μg) of the postnuclear homogenate were applied to 12.5% (NF-SLN and PLN) or 8% (SERCA2a and SERCA1a) acrylamide gels, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk, the membranes were incubated with both anti-α-sarcomeric actin antibody 5C5 to control for protein loading and either anti-FLAG antibody M2, anti-PLN antibody 1D11, anti-SERCA2a antibody 2A7-A1, or anti-SERCA1a antibody A52 for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. They were then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Promega) and stained with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce Super Signal). Densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image 16.1 software. Both samples for a given animal were run in duplicate on separate gels along with a standard. Microsomes prepared from HEK-293 cells that had been transfected with either NF-SLN or PLN cDNAs (7Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar) served as positive controls and molecular weight standards for NF-SLN and PLN, respectively. Western blotting was performed on post-nuclear homogenates from soleus muscles that expressed NF-SLN and microsomes prepared from HEK-293 cells that expressed both NF-SLN and either SERCA1a or SERCA2a. Soleus and HEK-293 samples were applied to the same 8% gel, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and stained for NF-SLN and either SERCA1a or SERCA2a using the appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Densitometric analysis was performed to determine the relative densitometric ratios of SERCA1a and SERCA2a to NF-SLN in both rat soleus and HEK-293 cells. To confirm association between SERCA2a, the predominant SERCA isoform expressed in rat soleus (26Zador E. Mendler L. Ver Heyen M. Dux L. Wuytack F. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 107-113Google Scholar), and NF-SLN, co-immunoprecipitation of SERCA2a and NF-SLN was carried out as described previously (21Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32855-32862Google Scholar) using aliquots of postnuclear homogenates at 1 mg protein/ml and a protein G-Sepharose/NF-SLN FLAG antibody M2 complex. The presence of SERCA2a associated with NF-SLN in the samples was then detected by Western blotting and detection procedures using the anti-SERCA2a monoclonal antibody 2A7-A1. Ca2+ transport activity in postnuclear homogenates at 1 mg protein/ml was assayed in 150 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mmMOPS/Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm potassium oxalate, and about 10 μg of protein as described previously (20Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15061-15064Google Scholar, 21Asahi M. Kimura Y. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32855-32862Google Scholar). The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the Sigma Plot Scientific graph system obtained from Jandel Scientific.K 0.5 values were calculated using an equation for a general cooperative model for substrate activation. The values for maximal transport activity that occurred at pCa 5.5 topCa 5 were taken directly from the experimental data and normalized for total protein concentration. The maximal transport activity values are reported as percentages of control (pcDNA), which was set to 100%. On a given analytical day, the samples from all conditions were analyzed in duplicate. The data are presented as the means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by ttest between control (pcDNA only) and soleus muscles injected with NF-SLN. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Preparations of total RNA from rat soleus muscle and rat heart were used in reverse transcription-PCR reactions to determine whether SLN is expressed endogenously in these tissues. We did not attempt to quantify SLN expression in either rat soleus or cardiac muscles, but we were able to confirm endogenousSLN expression in both of these tissues (data not shown). Rabbit NF-SLN cDNA was inserted into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector under regulation by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter contained in the vector. To confirm the presence of NF-SLN in rat soleus muscles injected with NF-SLN cDNA, we performed Western blotting on postnuclear homogenates from experimental muscles injected with the NF-SLN cDNA and control muscles injected with vector pcDNA3.1. NF-SLN was detected only in muscles that were injected with NF-SLN cDNA (Fig.1 A). Although NF-SLN expression was consistent across muscles, it was variable from experiment to experiment with standard deviations ranging from 1.7 S.D. above the mean to 1.1 S.D. below the mean (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that NF-SLN was localized with SERCA2a in the same microsomal membrane fraction, co-immunoprecipitation of SERCA2a with NF-SLN was carried out using the M2 antibody against NF-SLN. Fig.2 shows that physical interactions occurred between SERCA2a and NF-SLN in soleus muscles injected with NF-SLN cDNA. The relative expression of both SERCA2a (Fig.3 A) and SERCA1a (Fig.3 B) were compared between soleus muscles injected with NF-SLN cDNA and controls. Overall, there were no differences (p > 0.05) in either SERCA2a or SERCA1a expression levels between NF-SLN and control muscles (Fig. 3 C). We confirmed an earlier report (27Damiani E. Sacchetto R. Margreth A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1464: 1-41Google Scholar) in which immunoblot and Northern blot analysis were used to show that PLN is not expressed in rat soleus muscle (Fig. 3 D). It was of interest to obtain a measure of the amount of NF-SLN synthesis that occurred in soleus muscle following injection of NF-SLN cDNA. It was not feasible to determine absolute amounts, because purified NF-SLN was not available to us. It was, however, possible to determine the relative level of NF-SLN in relation to the amount of SERCA in soleus muscle and to compare the results with the ratio between NF-SLN and SERCA expressed in HEK-293 cells under conditions where optimal physiological effects are obtained. Western blotting was carried out on post-nuclear homogenates from soleus muscles that expressed NF-SLN and on microsomes prepared from HEK-293 cells that expressed NF-SLN together with either SERCA1a or SERCA2a. Soleus and HEK-293 samples were applied to the same 8% gel, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and stained for NF-SLN and either SERCA1a or SERCA2a using the appropriate monoclonal antibodies. Densitometric analysis was performed to determine the ratios of SERCA1a and SERCA2a to NF-SLN in the transfected rat soleus homogenate. Densitometric analysis was also used to determine ratios of SERCA1a to NF-SLN and SERCA2a to NF-SLN in HEK-293 cells that expressed NF-SLN and either SERCA1a or SERCA2a. Analysis of all eight soleus samples that expressed NF-SLN distinguished three samples that expressed the highest amount of NF-SLN relative to SERCA1a and SERCA2a (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1, 5, and 8). If we set the average SERCA:NF-SLN ratio in HEK-293 cells at 1, then we could calculate that the average densitometric ratio of SERCA2a to NF-SLN expression in soleus muscle was 3.75, and the ratio of SERCA1a to NF-SLN was 8.5. If we assume that SERCA1a and SERCA2a each account for about 50% of the total SERCA in soleus muscle (28Wu K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Google Scholar), then the average densitometric ratio of SERCA1a plus SERCA2a to NF-SLN would be about 6. On the basis of endogenous SERCA expression in soleus muscle, we are expressing only about 1/6 of the amount of NF-SLN that has optimal effects on SERCA function in HEK-293 cells. However, SLN is expressed endogenously in rat soleus muscle, presumably at an optimal level. Thus, in our experiments, it is the effect of NF-SLN overexpression on top of an optimal base line of SLN expression that we are measuring in our physiological studies of transfected soleus muscle. We present the analysis of muscle contractile function and SERCA function for the three experiments in which NF-SLN was most highly expressed. To evaluate the physiological effects of NF-SLN expression in slow twitch skeletal muscle, isometric contractile characteristics, including both twitch (Fig.4 A) and tetanus (Fig.5A), from soleus muscles injected with NF-SLN cDNA were measured in situ and compared with contractile characteristics assessed simultaneously in controls. NF-SLN reduced (p < 0.05) peak twitch force (P t) by 44% compared with control (Fig.4 B). The maximal twitch rate of contraction (+dF/dt) was reduced (p < 0.05) by 34%, and the maximal twitch rate of relaxation (−dF/dt) was reduced (p < 0.05) by 25% with NF-SLN expression (Fig. 4 C). Maximum tetanic force (P o), which occurred at a stimulation frequency of 50 Hz, was reduced (p < 0.05) by 47% (Fig. 5 B), tetanic +dF/dt was reduced (p < 0.05) by 50%, and tetanic −dF/dt was reduced (p < 0.05) by 40% with NF-SLN expression (Fig. 5 C).Figure 5Effect of NF-SLN on soleus isometric tetanic properties. Three days following injection and electrotransfer of NF-SLN into rat soleus, isometric tetanic properties (50 Hz) were measured in situ as described under “Experimental Procedures” and compared with tetanic properties assessed simultaneously in contralateral control muscles, which were injected with the expression vector pcDNA3.1. Tetanic contractile properties from three muscles that expressed the highest levels of NF-SLN and paired control muscles are shown. A, a typical tetanic (50 Hz) force record for a soleus muscle that was injected with NF-SLN and a matched control from one animal. B, peak tetanic amplitude (P o) measured at 50 Hz in control (filled bar) and soleus muscles that expressed NF-SLN (open bar).

When expressed as a percentage of normal resting values,P o was reduced (p < 0.05) by 71 ± 3.9%, and +dF/dt was reduced by 45 ± 6.6% in NF-SLN-expressing muscles compared with reductions in P o (p < 0.05) of 65 ± 2.8 and reductions in +dF/dt of 32 ± 7.6% in controls. In contrast, the peak relaxation rate was slowed with fatigue to a similar extent: 63 ± 5.1% in NF-SLN muscle and 71 ± 7.3% in control muscle. Postnuclear homogenates were adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg protein/ml and assayed for Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ uptake to assess the effects of NF-SLN expression on SERCA function. NF-SLN reduced absolute Ca2+ uptake across a range of free Ca2+ levels from pCa 7 to pCa 5 (Fig.6). NF-SLN reduced Ca2+uptake at pCa 5.5 to pCa 5 such that maximal transport activity was reduced (p < 0.05) by ∼31% compared with control. There was no significant change, however, in apparent Ca2+ affinity, expressed asK Ca in pCa units (6.36 ± 0.07versus 6.39 ± 0.08, mean ± S.E.). These data differ from those obtained in studies of co-expression of NF-SLN with SERCA1a or SERCA2a in HEK-293 cells, where a significant change was observed in apparent Ca2+ affinity (7Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar). This difference is most likely due to differences in the molar ratios of NF-SLN expression compared with the expression of SERCA. In our studies with HEK-293 cells (7Asahi M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26725-26728Google Scholar), we noted changes in ΔK Ca of −0.17 to −0.34 pCa units when the molar ratios of NF-SLN to SERCA1a or SERCA2a cDNAs used in transfection were 4:1. However, if the ratios were reduced to 1:1, then no differences in ΔK Ca were observed in the presence and absence of NF-SLN expression. It is probable that the ratio of SERCA to SLN remains high, even after overexpres"

By protein and molecular biology analysis, two unrelated probands who developed alloantibodies to the high frequency antigen GIL were found to be AQP3-deficient. The defect is caused by homozygous mutation affecting the 5′ donor splice site of intron 5 of the AQP3 gene. This mutation causes the skipping of exon 5 and generates a frameshift and premature stop codon. Functional studies by 90° light scattering using a stopped-flow spectrometer revealed the absence of facilitated glycerol transport across red cell membranes from the probands, but the water and urea transports were normal. Expression studies into COS-7 cells followed by flow cytometry analysis showed that only cells transfected with AQP3 cDNA strongly reacted with anti-GIL antibodies. These findings represent the first reported cases of AQP3 deficiency in humans and provide the molecular basis of a new blood group system, GIL, encoded by the AQP3 protein.

They are divided into three subgroups according to their sequences and function properties: (i) the aquaporins (AQP), permeable only to water; (ii) the glycerol facilitators, permeable only to glycerol (not present in mammals); and (iii) the aquaglyceroporins, which present a mixed selectivity. AQP1, the archetype of the MIP family selectively permeable to water (5Preston G.M. Carroll T.P. Guggino W.B. Agre P. Science. 1992; 256: 385-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), is present in various tissues including red blood cell (RBC) membranes from which it was first purified (6Denker B.M.

The high glycerol permeability of human RBCs is due to aquaglyceroporin AQP3 (7Roudier N. Verbavatz J.M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol.

Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7664-7669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is encoded by a single-copy gene composed of six exons distributed over 6 kilobases of DNA located on human chromosome 9p13 (12Inase N. Fushimi K. Ishibashi K. Uchida S. Ichioka M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17913-17916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The predicted protein of 292 residues is organized into six bilayer-spanning domains with the NH2- and COOH termini located intracellularly (13Preston G.M. Jung J.S. Guggino W.B. Agre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1668-1673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On human RBCs, AQP3 presumably is glycosylated on all subunits at Asn-141, the putative N-glycosylation site located in loop “c” at the external face of the cell membrane (14Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Saito F. Ikeuchi T. Marumo F. Genomics. 1995; 27: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). So far, AQP1 and AQP3 are the only two known proteins of the aquaporin family identified in human RBCs. As AQP1 express Colton blood group antigens (15Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Spring F.A. Anstee D.J. Agre P. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1043-1049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Agre P. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Transfus. Clin. Biol. 1995; 2: 303-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), the question was raised as to whether AQP3 might also be encoded by a blood group gene. We reasoned that if AQP3 carries a blood group specificity, the corresponding antigen should be of high frequency because AQP3 is a common protein of human RBCs. Accordingly, we performed an immunostaining analysis of human RBCs proteins from patients who had developed alloantibodies against high frequency antigens that caused delayed or severe hemolytic transfusion reactions. This approach led us to identify the first examples of AQP3null individuals and to define a new blood group system called GIL. 2The GIL blood group system was designated as No. 29 by the International Society of Blood Transfusion (Workshop Party on Blood Group Nomenclature, Vancouver, Canada, August, 2002). Proband 1 is a white French woman born in 1925. She had 10 pregnancies before 1979 when an antibody against a high frequency antigen (GIL) reacting with all human RBCs except her own was identified following a hemolytic reaction that occurred during orthopedic surgery (17Daniels G.L. Delong E.N. Hare V. Johnson S.T. Le Pennec P.Y. Mallory D. Marshall M.J. Oliver C. Spruell P. Immunohematology. 1998; 14: 49-52PubMed Google Scholar). Her RBCs were phenotyped O, GIL-negative. Blood samples from proband 1 and her family were collected after informed consent at the Centre National de Référence pour les Groupes Sanguins (CNRGS, Paris, France). Proband 2 is an unrelated white American woman born in 1956. She had no previous history of blood transfusion. In 1979, the RBCs from her first child had a weakly positive direct antiglobulin test, but there was no clinical sign of hemolytic disease of the newborn (17Daniels G.L. Delong E.N. Hare V. Johnson S.T. Le Pennec P.Y. Mallory D. Marshall M.J. Oliver C. Spruell P. Immunohematology. 1998; 14: 49-52PubMed Google Scholar). Her serum contains an anti-GIL antibody and she was phenotyped A, GIL-negative. Serum and DNA from proband 2 came from the frozen collection of the Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences (Bristol, UK). Modifying enzymes came from New England Biolabs (Hertfordshire, UK). Expand High Fidelity PCR, Titan One Tube RT-PCR systems, and N-glycosidase F (PNGase-F, 50 units/mg) were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Nucleotide primers were purchased from Genset (Paris, France). For primer designation, nucleotide (nt) position +1 was taken as the first nucleotide of the initiation codon of the human AQP3 cDNA clone (NCBI accession NM_004925). All reagents and peptide came from Sigma. AEBSF protease inhibitor was from Interchim (Montluçon, France). Rabbit polyclonal sera against human AQP1 (total protein) and the COOH-terminal region of rat AQP3 (residues 263–292) were characterized previously (7Roudier N. Verbavatz J.M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Laizé V. Rousselet G. Verbavatz J.M. Berthonaud V. Gobin R. Roudier N. Abrami L. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). RBC membrane proteins were prepared by hypotonic lysis in the presence of 0.5 mm AEBSF as described (19Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting was performed with rabbit anti-hAQP1 (1:4000) or anti-rAQP3 (1:500) antisera as described (8Roudier N. Bailly P. Gane P. Lucien N. Gobin R. Cartron J.P. Ripoche P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7664-7669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). N-glycosidase F treatment of RBC membrane proteins was performed overnight at 37 °C according to manufacturer's instructions. Total blood RNA extracted by the acid-phenol-guanidinium method (20Lozano M.E. Grau O. Romanowski V. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) was used for the first PCR in the Titan One Tube reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system between primers SP1 (nt −52 to −36) and ASP1 (nt 932–913) according to the manufacturer's instructions with annealing temperature of 60 °C and elongation time of 45 s. The second PCR was performed with one fiftieth of the first reaction in the same condition, except that the first step of the first cycle was omitted and the elongation temperature was 72 °C, using primers SP2 (nt −23 to −7) and ASP2 (nt 907–889) and Expand High Fidelity system. The PCR products were subcloned and sequenced on both strands using the Big Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing ready Reaction Kit and analyzed on an ABI-Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Direct PCR amplification was carried out on genomic DNA between primers SP3 (5′-aacagagtctcaggccctcc-3′, nucleotides −171 to −152 upstream exon 4) and ASP3 (nucleotides 807–788 in exon 6) using the Expand High Fidelity system according to manufacturer's instructions with annealing temperature of 62 °C and elongation time of 1 min. PCR products were subcloned and sequenced as above. The AQP3(Δ5) mutation was detected by PCR restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The 1027-bp PCR product was digested with 5 units ofPmlI endonuclease and analyzed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. Each PCR reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 μl containing 100 ng of genomic DNA extracted from blood cells using a Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit from Promega (Madison, WI). Glycerol influx was induced by mixing a fresh or thawed RBC suspension (1.5% hematocrit) with an equal volume of a hyperosmotic solution of glycerol to produce a 100 mosmol/kg H2O inwardly directed osmotic glycerol gradient. The kinetics of RBC volume changes were followed by 90° light scattering using a stopped-flow spectrophotometer Biologic SFM3 instrument (Claix, France) as described (7Roudier N. Verbavatz J.M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Glycerol efflux was induced by equilibrating the RBC suspension in 200 mosmol/kg H2O glycerol for 1 h prior analysis (to insure that RBCs would be loaded with glycerol even if a glycerol proteic pathway were absent) and mixing them with a 200 mosmol/kg H2O mannitol solution in isoosmotic conditions to produce a 100 mosmol/kg H2O outwardly directed glycerol gradient. Inhibition studies were performed by incubating RBCs for 10 min with 0.1 mm CuCl2, and in some cases, 1 mm Gly-Gly-His peptide was added to remove the copper effect. Data from 5–10 time courses were averaged and fitted to single exponential functions by using the Simplex procedure of the Biokine software (Biologic, France) to determine the glycerol uptake or efflux rate constants (k, in s−1). Transient expression of AQP3 in COS-7 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was performed by DEAE-dextran transfection with the full-length hAQP3 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. Ishibashi) subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Leek, The Netherlands) as described (21Hermand P. Huet M. Callebaut I. Gane P. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26002-26010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Four days after transfection, 2.5 × 105 cells resuspended in LISS/glycine buffer (NaCl 30 mm, glycine 237 mm, NaH2PO4 1.3 mm, Na2HPO4 1.2 mm, pH 7.2) supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and goat serum (1:20) were incubated at 37 °C with alloanti-GIL sera at saturation (1:16 in LISS/glycine/bovine serum albumin buffer). After 20 min, the cells were washed and stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-human IgG (1:40). Flow cytometry analysis (FASCalibur, BD Biosciences) was performed as before (20Lozano M.E. Grau O. Romanowski V. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Occasionally, the cells were fixed first in HCHO 1% (v/v) for 15 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 1% (w/v)N-octyl glucoside before binding with anti-rAQP3 and fluorescence labeling with a second antibody. RBCs from 24 individuals who developed alloantibodies directed against unidentified high frequency antigens were analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-rAQP3 antibody, which cross-reacts with human AQP3 (hAQP3) protein (7Roudier N. Verbavatz J.M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). RBC membranes from one of these individuals, proband 1, lacked the deglycosylated (25 kDa) and glycosylated (45 kDa) AQP3 protein forms visualized in control RBCs (Fig.1 A). Proband 1 exhibited the rare phenotype called GIL-negative, and her serum contained an alloanti-GIL (17Daniels G.L. Delong E.N. Hare V. Johnson S.T. Le Pennec P.Y. Mallory D. Marshall M.J. Oliver C. Spruell P. Immunohematology. 1998; 14: 49-52PubMed Google Scholar). RBCs from a second GIL-negative individual (proband 2) were also found AQP3-deficient (Fig. 1 A). As control, all tested RBCs showed a normal expression of AQP1 protein (not shown). To determine the molecular basis of AQP3 deficiency, AQP3 transcripts from proband 1 and a control were amplified by RT-PCR (712versus 930 bp), and several independent clones were sequenced. A spliceoform called AQP3(Δ5), which resulted from the alternative splicing of exon 5, was identified in proband 1 (Fig.1 B). Genomic analysis indicated that the skipping of exon 5 was most likely caused by a g-to-a transition that altered the invariant g nucleotide of the 5′-donor splice site of intron 5 (Fig.2 A). The same transition was found in the genomic DNA from proband 2 (not shown). The AQP3(Δ5) transcript would potentially encode a truncated polypeptide of 281 amino acid residues (versus 292) with a new COOH-terminal region generated by a frameshift and premature termination. The predicted AQP3(Δ5) polypeptide would lack amino acids 165–237 (encoded by exon 5) overlapping the fourth and fifth transmembrane domains and the “e” extracellular loop of the hAQP3 protein (see Fig. 2 B). To confirm this finding and screen theAQP3*(Δ5) silent allele in the proband 1 family and in random blood donors, and because the g to a substitution correlated with a PmlI restriction site polymorphism, we were able to develop a PCR-RFLP genotyping assay (Fig. 2 A). PCR-RFLP analysis indicated that the 1027-bp product amplified from AQP3-positive individuals was cleaved into fragments of 841 and 186 bp (Figs. 2 A and 3,top panel). In contrast, the PCR product amplified from proband 1 (Fig. 3) and also from proband 2 (not shown), carrying the AQP3(Δ5) mutation, remained uncut, demonstrating the homozygosity of this mutation in both individuals. Examination of the proband 1 family for the AQP3(Δ5) mutation indicated that her sister (I.2) and 10 children (II.1 to II.10) were heterozygous, as a combination of digested fragments of 1027, 841, and 186 bp was observed (Fig. 3, top). Immunoblot analysis with a rabbit anti-AQP3 shows that although the RBC level of AQP3 is clearly lower in heterozygotes than in the homozygous control (Fig. 3,middle), there is some variation between heterozygous samples themselves, which might be related in part to the amount of protein loaded on the gel. However, examination of the same gel stained for the AQP1 protein revealed a similar staining intensity in all samples of the family (Fig. 3, bottom), therefore suggesting some gene dosage effect correlated with transport function activity, as shown below. The glycerol permeability of RBCs from control donors and from probands 1 and 2 lacking the AQP3 protein was determined by stopped-flow analysis (Fig.4). In hyperosmotic conditions (inwardly directed glycerol gradient), control RBCs exhibited a biphasic curve with a first rapid increase followed by a decrease of the scattered light intensity, corresponding, respectively, to the shrinkage of RBCs due to water efflux and the swelling of RBCs resulting from the glycerol influx with a concomitant water flow (Fig. 4 B,control). Conversely, only a very low decrease in light intensity was detected with RBCs from probands, indicating that the glycerol permeability due to the facilitated pathway was absent. Rate constants (k) of the apparent cell volume swelling due to the glycerol uptake were 0.127 ± 0.033, 0.003 ± 0.001, and 0.001 s−1 at 22 °C for control, proband 1 and proband 2 RBCs, respectively. Interestingly, the glycerol permeability of two heterozygotes (I.2 and II.1) was approximately half that of the controls with rate constants of 0.051 and 0.044 s−1, respectively (not shown), in accordance with the reduced AQP3 expression protein detected on an immunoblot (Fig. 3). Additionally, the glycerol transport of control RBCs incubated with CuCl2, an inhibitor of the glycerol-facilitated pathway (22Carlsen A. Wieth J.O. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1976; 97: 501-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), was drastically inhibited (Fig. 4 A,control+ Cu 2+) and was equivalent to proband RBC glycerol transport. However, when the copper chelator peptide Gly-Gly-His was added after incubation with CuCl2, the glycerol transport across control RBCs recovered (Fig.4 A,control+Cu 2+ +His). The measurements performed at different temperatures allowed us to calculate the activation energy (Ea) of the glycerol transport (Fig. 4 B,inset), which were 3.6 and 12.1 kcal/mol for control and proband 1 RBCs, respectively, thus excluding another glycerol channel in human RBCs. Glycerol efflux was followed in isoosmotic conditions (RBCs loaded with glycerol, generating an outwardly directed glycerol gradient) with control and proband 1 RBCs. The efflux of glycerol induces a shrinkage of control RBCs illustrated by an increase of the scattered light intensity (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the scattered light intensity remained unchanged with proband 1 RBCs and with control RBCs incubated first with copper; the glycerol transport recovered in the latter sample after the addition of histidine peptide (Fig.4 C). Control experiments further indicated that AQP1-mediated water transport and hUT-B1-mediated urea transport of proband RBCs were normal (not shown). Since both AQP3-deficient probands were GIL-negative and had alloantibodies to the GIL antigen in their serum (17Daniels G.L. Delong E.N. Hare V. Johnson S.T. Le Pennec P.Y. Mallory D. Marshall M.J. Oliver C. Spruell P. Immunohematology. 1998; 14: 49-52PubMed Google Scholar), flow cytometry analysis was performed to confirm that proband sera reacted with control RBCs (group O, GIL-positive) but not with proband 1 RBCs (O, GIL-negative), as shown in Fig. 5. As expected, proband sera reacted strongly with control RBCs even at low dilution and when the RBCs were trypsin- or papain-treated (not shown), whereas no increase of the fluorescence was seen with enzyme-treated proband 1 RBCs, which lacked the AQP3 protein. Thus, the development of antibodies in proband sera after transfusion or pregnancy, as well as the absence of AQP3 in their RBC membranes seen by immunoblot, strongly suggested that both events were related. To provide the formal proof that AQP3 carried the blood group GIL specificity, transient expression of AQP3 protein in COS-7 cells was performed by cloning AQP3 cDNA into the human cytomegalovirus promoter-controlled expression vector, pcDNA3. Flow cytometry analysis of AQP3 transfectants was performed with rabbit anti-rAQP3 serum and anti-GIL antibodies. The anti-rAQP3 reacted with the AQP3 transfectants but not with parental COS-7 cells, whereas neither type of cells reacted with a pre-immune rabbit serum (not shown). Moreover, immunoblotting with the anti-rAQP3 showed that the glycosylated (45 kDa) and deglycosylated (25 kDa) forms of the AQP3 protein were present in AQP3 transfectants but not in parental COS-7 cells (Fig.6, left). Further studies with human sera from both probands reacted with AQP3-COS-7 but not with parental COS-7 cells, as the percentage of fluorescent cells were 14 and 13% versus 1.6 and 0.5%, for probands 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 6, right). In contrast, a human serum sample devoid of anti-GIL antibody used as control reacted neither with AQP3 COS-7 nor with COS-7 parental cells. These findings indicate that the pcDNA3-AQP3 construct directed the synthesis of a AQP3 cell surface protein recognized by sera containing alloanti-GIL antibodies developed by GIL-negative probands 1 and 2 who were genotyped AQP3null in these studies. This is the first report of human AQP3 deficiency; it was discovered by probing, with a rabbit serum against the AQP3 protein, RBCs from two unrelated patients who developed alloantibodies against high frequency blood group antigens following transfusion or pregnancy. The two probands belong to the rare blood group phenotype called GIL-negative, found among five cases published previously (17Daniels G.L. Delong E.N. Hare V. Johnson S.T. Le Pennec P.Y. Mallory D. Marshall M.J. Oliver C. Spruell P. Immunohematology. 1998; 14: 49-52PubMed Google Scholar). Although both probands, who exhibited the same molecular genetic basis, were apparently unrelated, it could not be determined whether they might have a common ancestor. Transcript sequencing and genomic analysis indicated that the lack of AQP3 protein was caused by a single nucleotide substitution at the conserved 5′ donor (gt→at) (where italics represent the location of mutated nucleotides) splice site of intron 5 of theAQP3 gene, which resulted in exon 5 skipping, frameshifts, and premature termination of translation. PCR-RFLP genotyping further indicated that the probands were homozygous for the AQP3(Δ5) mutation, whereas the sister and 10 children of proband 1 were heterozygous. In addition, there was a clear gene dosage effect as two heterozygous individuals, investigated in more detail, who were both typed as GIL-positive, carried approximately a half-dose of AQP3 protein on RBCs and exhibited a glycerol transport activity about half that of control cells, as seen by light-scattering stopped-flow analysis. Additionally, AQP3null RBCs exhibited a drastic reduction of glycerol permeability as deduced from analysis of in-and-out facilitated glycerol fluxes. These results suggest that the AQP3(Δ5) isoform is either not functional or not expressed at the RBC membrane. The potential reduction of water and urea movements in proband RBCs could not be estimated because AQP1 and hUT-B1 were normally present and responsible for at least 90% of the water and urea movements across RBCs, respectively. Residual mercury-sensitive water permeability detected in ColtonnullRBCs, which lack AQP1, was previously accredited to AQP3 (7Roudier N. Verbavatz J.M. Maurel C. Ripoche P. Tacnet F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8407-8412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The high activation energy of glycerol permeability found in AQP3null cells suggests the absence of another glycerol channel. However, normal mice RBCs are deficient in AQP3 expression but, surprisingly, showed a phloretin-sensitive glycerol permeability attributed to another protein transport pathway (23Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Another important result of these studies is the conclusive demonstration that AQP3 carries blood group GIL specificity: (i) AQP3null individuals belong to the GIL-negative phenotype; (ii) the rabbit anti-AQP3 antibody reacts on immunoblots with GlyAQP3 and AQP3 components present in GIL-positive but not GIL-negative RBCs; (iii) the glycerol permeability of GIL-negative RBCs is severely reduced; (iv) alloanti-GIL in probands' sera reacted by flow cytometry with AQP3-positive but not AQP3null RBCs; (v) AQP3-transfected cells reacted with anti-GIL present in the serum of GIL-negative individuals. Altogether, these findings provide the necessary information to define the molecular basis of a new blood group system, GIL, encoding the aquaglyceroprotein AQP3. Accordingly, it can be deduced that the GIL locus is located on the short arm of chromosome 9p13 and is the second blood group on this chromosome with the ABO locus located on the long arm at 9q34. As AQP3 protein has a wide tissue distribution in the epithelial cells of kidney, airways, and skin and in immature dendritic cells, suggesting a role in water reabsorption, mucosal secretions, allergic diseases, and cell volume regulation (24Nielsen S.

Moreover, AQP3, which efficiently transport glycerol, might be implicated in energy metabolism (28Lin E.C.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 765Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The absence of clinical disorders in normal life conditions has been also observed in Coltonnull patients who are deficient for AQP1 (29Preston G.M. Smith B.L. Zeidel M.L. Moulds J.J. Agre P. Science. 1994; 265: 1585-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 30Mathai J.C. Mori S. Smith B.L. Preston G.M. Mohandas N. Collins M. van Zijl P.C. Zeidel M.L. Agre P. J. Biol.

Fernandez P.C. Cartron J.P. Agre P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2001; 345: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and a decrease in pulmonary vascular permeability (32King L.S. Nielsen S. Agre P. Brown R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1059-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have been detected in Coltonnull individuals. Thus, detailed clinical studies of AQP3null individuals, like those conducted with AQP1null individuals, should provide useful information on the biological role of the AQP3 protein. Interestingly, investigations of AQP3null mice revealed a marked polyuria, urine hypoosmolarity, and partial response to V2 agonists representative of a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (23Yang B. Ma T. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 624-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 33Ma T. Song Y. Yang B. Gillespie A. Carlson E.J. Epstein C.J. Verkman A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). A hypotriglyceridemia was also detected in AQP3null mice. Additionally, AQP3 might be involved in skin hydration, as a defect of stratum corneum hydration has been described in these animals (27Ma T. Hara M. Sougrat R. Verbavatz J.M. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17147-17153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). An important benefit that emerges from these studies is the identification of AQP3null mutation in humans and the characterization of the novel blood group system GIL. These findings should stimulate future investigations in RBCs and various organs to probe the physiological role of this aquaporin and to understand the significance of its channel selectivity.

https://openalex.org/W2086046729,"Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) and calcineurin are essential regulators of immune cell and mesenchymal cell differentiation. Here we show that elevated intracellular calcium induces chondrogenesis through a calcineurin/NFAT signaling axis that activates bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) expression. The calcium ionophore, ionomycin, induced chondrogenesis through activation of calcineurin. The calcineurin substrate, NFAT4, also induced chondrogenesis and chondrocyte gene expression. Significantly, the BMP antagonist, noggin, or dominant negative BMP receptors blocked the effects of elevated intracellular calcium on chondrogenesis. This suggested that calcineurin/NFAT4 activates BMP expression. Consistent with this, BMP2 gene expression was increased by ionomycin and suppressed by the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporine A. Furthermore, activated NFAT4 induced BMP2 gene expression. These results have important implications for the effects of NFATs during development and adaptive responses."

Potassium channels show an exceptional functional diversity, being implicated in neural and behavioral plasticity, secretion, and cell proliferation (1Latorre R. Saez J.C. From Ion Channels to Cell-to-Cell Conversations. Plenum Press, New York1997Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to regulating cell excitability, the channels themselves can be modulated in a cell-specific manner through second messengers, hormones, and neurotransmitters (2Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001Google Scholar). The fact that >60 distinct K+ genes have now been cloned provides a molecular basis for this diversity (3Coetzee W.A. Amarillo Y. Chiu J. Chow A. Lau D. McCormack T. Moreno H. Nadal M.S. Ozaita A.

The Indian red scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) causes annually a large number of deaths, especially among young children on the Indian subcontinent (19Santhanakrishnan B.R. Balagopal Raju V. J. Trop.

Based on sequence homology and disulfide bridges, tamapin can be assigned to toxin subfamily 5 (22Tytgat J. Chandy K.G. Garcia M.L. Gutman G.A. Martin-Eauclaire M.-F. van der Walt J.J. Possani L.D.

It displaces apamin from rat brain synaptosomes with high affinity and inhibits the afterhyperpolarizing current (I AHP) mediated by native SK channels in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (4Stocker M.

Tamapin inhibits SK currents in heterologous expression systems and shows the highest potency for recombinant SK2 channels to date. Native apamin was purified fromApis mellifera bee venom, and [125I]monoiodoapamin (∼2200 Ci/mmol) was prepared as described previously (23Strong P.N. Wadsworth J.D.F. Rochat H. Martin- Eauclaire M.-F. Methods and Tools in Biosciences and Medicine: Animal Toxins. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2000: 127-151Google Scholar). Low pressure chromatography media were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Protease inhibitors and bovine serum albumin (fraction V, protease-free) were purchased from Sigma. All other chemical were reagent-grade and obtained from Merck. Indian red scorpions (Mesob. tamulus) were collected in the state of Maharashtra at the end of the rainy season (November through December) and kept at the Haffkine Institute. Scorpions were milked by electrical stimulation of their venom glands, and the venom was immediately lyophilized. Venom (220 mg) was resuspended in deionized water (50 ml) and adjusted to pH 3 with HCl. After gentle vortexing, the venom suspension was clarified by centrifugation (48,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was removed from the mucous-like residue and passed through a 0.2-μm filter (Sartorius Corp., Göttingen, Germany). The sample was applied in two batches to a Sephadex G-50 column (2.6 × 86 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm ammonium formate (pH 3.5). The column was eluted with the equilibration buffer (40 ml/h), and elution was monitored at 280 nm. 15-min fractions were collected, and those with apamin-like activity (determined by inhibitory binding assay) were pooled and lyophilized. Active fractions were dissolved in 20 ml of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8) (buffer A) and applied to an SP 16/10 Hi-load cation-exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. After washing, the column was eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 0–100% buffer B (buffer A containing 1 m NaCl) at 1 ml/min. 4-min fractions were collected and monitored at 280 nm, and fractions with apamin-like activity were pooled. Active fractions (eluting at 350–450 mm NaCl) were rechromatographed on the same ion-exchange column using a shallower gradient (500 ml of 35–55% buffer B), affording the separation of two active peaks (corresponding to tamapin and tamapin-2). The fractions corresponding to each peak were pooled, desalted on a Sephadex G-10 column (2.6 × 94 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm ammonium formate (pH 4.8), and lyophilized. Tamapin and tamapin-2 were independently purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase HPLC in two steps. In the first step, the sample was loaded onto a 300-Å pore size C8 reversed-phase column (5 μm, 3.2 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer C). The column was initially eluted with a linear gradient of 0–75% buffer D (buffer C containing 60% acetonitrile) for 10 min and subsequently with a linear gradient of 75–100% buffer D for 60 min. Fractions that eluted from the column (0.5 ml/min) were assayed for apamin-like activity. In the second step, active fractions were applied to the same column equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile and 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5.5) (buffer E). The column was eluted (0.5 ml/min) with a linear gradient of 0–100% buffer F (buffer E containing 80% acetonitrile). The purity of tamapin and tamapin-2 was checked by rerunning pooled active fractions from the second reversed-phase column on a 5-μm Jupiter C18 reversed-phase column (1 × mm 150) equilibrated with 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Bound material was eluted at flow rate of 50 μl/min with a linear gradient of 20–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Tamapin and tamapin-2 were judged to be 97–98% pure under these conditions. Purified tamapin and tamapin-2 were analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a triple quadrupole instrument equipped with an ionspray interface (PerkinElmer Life Sciences API 300 liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry). Samples (20 μl) were directly infused into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The ionspray voltage was set at 4600 V, the ring voltage at 350 V, and the orifice voltage at 30 V. Nitrogen was used as the curtain gas, and compressed air was used as the nebulizer gas. Toxin samples were sequenced by automated Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model 494 pulsed liquid-phase sequencer (Procise). Phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivatives were identified using an on-line reversed-phase PTH-C18 column in an Applied Biosystems 785A phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analyzer. The sequence of tamapin was confirmed by repeating the analysis four times on a total of three different samples. The sequence of tamapin-2 was confirmed by sequencing two different samples. Lyophilized samples (∼10–30 nmol) were resuspended in 100 μl of denaturant buffer (6m guanidine hydrochloride, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.13m Tris HCl (pH 8.0)). After the addition of β-mercaptoethanol (2 μl), the solution was incubated under nitrogen (2 h, 37 °C). 4-Vinylpyridine (20 μl) was subsequently added, and the mixture was incubated under nitrogen at room temperature for a further 2 h. The reaction mixture was immediately desalted by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column. 125I-Apamin binding to rat brain synaptic plasma membranes was performed using a filtration binding assay essentially as described previously (23Strong P.N. Wadsworth J.D.F. Rochat H. Martin- Eauclaire M.-F. Methods and Tools in Biosciences and Medicine: Animal Toxins. Birkhaeuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland2000: 127-151Google Scholar, 24Wadsworth J.D. Doorty K.B. Strong P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18053-18061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The incubation medium (1 ml) consisted of 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 25 mm Tris (pH 8.4) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Aliquots of membranes (100 μg of protein) were incubated for 1 h on ice in the presence of 10 pm125I-apamin and crude Mesob. tamulus venom, individual chromatographic fractions, or purified toxins. The binding reaction was quenched by the addition of ice-cold incubation medium and rapid filtration (<20 s) through Whatman GF/B FP-100 filters presoaked for 1 h at 4 °C in 0.5% (v/v) polyethyleneimine. The computer program EBDA (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) was used to calculate the IC50 value (toxin concentration that inhibits 50% of the binding of 125I-apamin) from the raw data. IC50values were then used to calculate the true equilibrium dissociation constant of the inhibitory ligand (K i) using the Cheng and Prusoff equation (55Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar): IC50 =K i(1 + L*/K d), whereL* is the free concentration of 125I-apamin at half-displacement and K d is the dissociation constant for 125I-apamin. The experiments were designed to produce IC50 values in the range of 2–4-fold higher than the K i. Replicate samples typically varied between 3 and 5%. Samples were counted in a calibrated γ-counter. HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 1 ml of penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2 and 95% air) at 37 °C. For transfection, cells were grown to 50–60% confluency, and 6 μg of rat SK2 or rat SK3 cDNA (subcloned in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3) were transfected using the CaPO4 method (25Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were selected in medium supplemented with 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin (G418). To generate clonal cell lines, single cell clones were trypsinized and replated. This was performed at least twice before a cell line was established. For recordings, cells were cultured in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418. Expression of rat SK2 or rat SK3 was confirmed by immunofluorescence and by patch-clamp measurements. The SK1-CHO-Flp-In cell line was generated using the Flp-In system (Invitrogen). Briefly, human SK1 was cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT vector. For transfection, 0.9 μg of SK1-pcDNA5/FRT were cotransfected with 10 μg of pOG44 into the CHO-Flp-In cells using LipofectAMINETM together with the PlusTMreagent (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in medium containing 0.1 mg/ml hygromycin B. Expression of human SK1 was confirmed by patch-clamp recordings, where the half-maximal blocking concentrations of apamin and d-tubocurarine were applied. The cell line stably expressing human SK4/human IK1 channels was a kind gift of W. J. Joiner and L. K. Kaczmarek (26Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11013-11018Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. HEK293 cells or CHO-Flp-In cells expressing SK1, SK2, SK3, or IK1 channels were grown on coverslips, placed in a recording chamber, and perfused at a rate of 4 ml/min. Currents were recorded using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany), and data were acquired with Pulse/Pulsefit software (HEKA) and analyzed with Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Kimble Glass Inc., Vineland, NY) with a vertical patch electrode puller (List Medical, Darmstadt, Germany). Pipettes had a resistance of 2–3 megaohms when filled with intracellular solution (see below). After gigaseal formation, the capacitative transients were automatically compensated. MgCl2 and CaCl2 concentrations were adjusted using EqCal (Biosoft) to obtain free calcium concentrations of 1 μm, 10 μm, and 1 mm. SK and IK channels were activated by whole-cell dialysis with an intracellular solution containing 130 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and variable concentrations of MgCl2and CaCl2 (see above) adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH. Recordings were performed in a symmetrical potassium or potassium-free extracellular solution containing 144 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm CaCl2 adjusted to pH 7.4 with KOH (symmetrical); 144 mm NaCl replaced KCl in the potassium-free solution. Currents were recorded upon application of voltage ramps from −100 to +40 mV with a duration of 400 ms, repeated every 5 s. Alternatively, 100- or 200-ms-long voltage steps from −100 to +40 mV with increments of 20 mV were applied. Given the large size of some currents, voltages were corrected off-line for the occurring voltage-clamp error. Wistar rats (19–30 days old) were anesthetized with halothane, and after decapitation, transverse hippocampal slices (300 μm thick) were prepared using a VT1000S Vibroslicer (Leica). During recording, the slices were superfused with standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid (125 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm KCl, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 16 mm glucose) saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at room temperature (21–24 °C). In voltage-clamp experiments, tetrodotoxin (0.5 μm) and tetraethylammonium (1 mm) were added to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid. In the experiments in which low concentrations (0.5 and 2 nm) of tamapin were tested, bovine serum albumin (25 μg/ml) was added to the artificial cerebrospinal fluid to minimize possible nonspecific binding of the toxin to the perfusion system. As such, albumin had no effect onI AHP (data not shown). Whole-cell gigaseal recordings were obtained from CA1 pyramidal cells in the slice using the “blind” method (27Blanton M.G. Lo Turco J.J. Kriegstein A.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1989; 30: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). The patch pipette solution contained 135 mm potassium gluconate, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm Na2ATP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mmNa3GTP (pipette resistance of 3–6 megaohms); 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (50 μm) was included to measure the apamin-sensitive AHP current in isolation (see also Ref.4Stocker M. Krause M. Pedarzani P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4662-4667Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). All neurons included in this study had a resting membrane potential below −55 mV (−62.1 ± 0.7 mV, n = 27). Using the EPC-9 amplifier, the cells were voltage-clamped at −50 mV, and depolarizing steps (100 ms long) of sufficient amplitude (typically +60 or +70 mV) to elicit a robust, unclamped Ca2+ action current were applied once every 30 s. The access resistance (range of 10–25 megaohms) and the amplitude and time course of the Ca2+ current during the step showed only minimal variations during the recordings included in this study. Only cells with a stable resting potential throughout the current-clamp protocols (±0.5 mV) were included in the analysis. Records were filtered at 0.25–1 kHz and digitized at 1–4 kHz. All data were acquired, stored, and analyzed on a Power Macintosh 7100/66 using the Pulse/Pulsefit software and Igor Pro. Values are reported as means ± S.E. Student's ttest was used for statistical comparisons between groups (α = 0.05). Crude Mesob. tamulus venom inhibited the binding of [125I]monoiodoapamin to rat brain synaptic plasma membranes (Fig. 1 A). Apamin binding (B) is expressed as a percent of total binding determined in the absence of any competing ligand (B 0). The sigmoidal shape of the binding curve in this semilogarithmic plot suggests that there is only one molecule (or one class of molecules with similar affinity) that interacts with apamin-sensitive SK channels. To purify the apamin-binding activity, crude venom was initially fractionated by gel-exclusion chromatography on Sephadex G-50. Several unresolved peaks absorbing at 280 nm were observed (Fig.1 B), the majority with molecular masses of ∼10 kDa or less. Fractions active in the 125I-apamin inhibitory binding assay (fractions 27–37) were pooled and chromatographed on an S-Sepharose ion-exchange column, eluting fractions with a salt gradient (0.05–1 m NaCl) (data not shown). Rechromatography of the most active fractions on the same column using a shallow salt gradient (0.35–0.55 m NaCl) yielded two peaks of inhibitory apamin-binding activity (peaks I and II) (Fig. 1 C). Tamapin (peak I) was finally purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase chromatography on a C8 column (Fig. 1 D). Tamapin was judged to be >98% pure by chromatography on a reversed-phase C18 column using a shallow solvent gradient (20–40% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) (Fig. 1 D,inset). Homogeneity was confirmed by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE (data not shown). A unique N-terminal residue (alanine) was detected upon automated Edman degradation, which gave an initial yield of 56% and a repetitive yield of 93%. The sequence of tamapin was determined after reduction and pyridylethylation of cysteine residues (TableI). The molecular mass of tamapin as determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (3457.9 ± 0.2 Da) was 1 mass unit less than that calculated from the amino acid sequence (3459.1 Da) (Table II). Digestion of tamapin with either carboxypeptidase A or carboxypeptidase Y failed to detect any amino acids within the time that the ultimate and penultimate residues of dendrotoxin were hydrolyzed (data not shown). Taken together, the mass spectrometry data and the lack of digestion by carboxypeptidases strongly suggest that tamapin is amidated at its C-terminal tyrosine residue (see also Ref. 9Chicchi G.G. Gimenez-Gallego G. Ber E. Garcia M.L. Winquist R. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10192-10197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tamapin shares 77% amino acid sequence similarity with scyllatoxin and 74% with PO5 (Table I), and all three toxins are 31 amino acids long. The six cysteine residues can be found at identical positions within the primary sequences of these toxins. The sequence similarity to other toxins competing with apamin in binding assays, such as maurotoxin, Pi1, PO1, and T. serrulatus κ toxin, is substantially lower (<30%).Table IPrimary sequence of tamapin and alignment with two other SK channel toxins from scorpion venoms, scyllatoxin and PO5The amino acids that are not conserved in the three toxin sequences are boxed in black.

The RXCQ motif, conserved in PO5 (Swiss-Prot accession number P31719) and scyllatoxin (Swiss-Prot accession numberP16341), is boxed in grey and is changed to RRCE in tamapin. A second active fraction (peak II) (Fig. 1 C) was purified to homogeneity by reversed-phase chromatography (>97% pure by HPLC) (data not shown) in a manner analogous to tamapin. Upon sequencing, this second fraction was identified as an isoform of tamapin, differing by a single amino acid residue (His instead of Tyr) at its carboxyl terminus. The molecular mass of tamapin-2 determined by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (3431.4 ± 0.2 Da) was ∼1 mass unit less than that calculated from the amino acid sequence (3433.1 Da) (Table II), suggesting that tamapin-2 might also be amidated. Both tamapin and tamapin-2 inhibited the binding of [125I]monoiodoapamin to rat brain synaptic plasma membranes with equivalent high affinity (K i = 12 and 8 pm, respectively) (Fig. 2). Both toxins bound to a single class of binding sites. In comparison, tamapin inhibited neither the binding of 125I-dendrotoxin or 125I-charybdotoxin to rat brain membranes nor charybdotoxin-sensitive 86Rb+ fluxes in C6 glioma cells (data not shown). Three SK channels have been cloned, SK1, SK2, and SK3 (26Joiner W.J. Wang L.Y. Tang M.D. Kaczmarek L.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An additional, less closely related member of the SK channel family is the intermediate conductance channel SK4, also known as IK1, which is not expressed in neuronal cells and is not sensitive to apamin (26Joiner W.J.

Given their similar kinetic properties and Ca2+ dependence, the functional role of SK channels with different subunit compositions in different tissues and brain regions is hard to dissect. For this purpose, toxins capable of distinguishing different SK channels represent extremely valuable pharmacological tools. However, a number of toxins that have been isolated as putative SK channel modulators do not display any activity as blockers despite their capability of displacing apamin from its binding sites (12Lecomte C.

https://openalex.org/W1982173676,"Gastrin is a hormone produced by G-cells in the normal gastric antrum. However, colorectal carcinoma cells may aberrantly produce gastrin and exhibit increased expression of cholecystokinin B (CCK-B)/gastrin receptors. Gastrin is trophic for the normal gastric oxyntic mucosa and exerts a growth-promoting action on gastrointestinal malignancy. Thus, gastrin may act as an autocrine/paracrine or endocrine factor in the initiation and progression of colorectal carcinoma. The molecular mechanisms involved have not been elucidated. Hypergastrinemia induced byHelicobacter pylori infection is associated with increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in gastric and colorectal tissues, suggesting the possibility that gastrin up-regulates COX-2 expression in these tissues; this has not been confirmed. We report here that gastrin significantly increases the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein, the activity of the COX-2 promoter, and the release of prostaglandin E2 from a rat intestinal epithelial cell line transfected with the CCK-B receptor. These actions were dependent upon the activation of multiple MAPK signal pathways, including ERK5 kinase; transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor; and the increased expression and activities of transcription factors ELK-1, activating transcription factor-2, c-Fos, c-Jun, activator protein-1, and myocyte enhancer factor-2. Thus, our findings identify the signaling pathways coupling the CCK-B receptor with up-regulation of COX-2 expression.

Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Google Scholar). A large body of genetic and biochemical evidence supports the important role of COX-2 in tumorigenesis, particularly in colorectal cancer (1Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Google Scholar). COX-2 is overexpressed in cancer cells and is associated with enhanced invasiveness (1Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms leading to up-regulation of COX-2 in intestinal cells are not completely understood. Gastrointestinal hormones regulate gastrointestinal homeostasis by affecting cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and gene expression. Aberrant control of these biological processes is thought to play an important role in establishment of intestinal neoplasia (2Podolsky D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G179-G186Google Scholar,3Guo Y.-S. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Hepatobiliary Pancreat. Surg. 2000; 7: 276-285Google Scholar). Gastrin is a gastrointestinal hormone that is produced by G-cells in the normal gastric antrum (4Rozengurt E. Walsh J.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 49-76Google Scholar). We (5Upp Jr., J.R.

Gastrin is trophic for the normal gastric oxyntic mucosa and exerts a growth-promoting action on gastrointestinal malignancy (3Guo Y.-S. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Hepatobiliary Pancreat.

Ciccotosto et al. (9Ciccotosto G.D. McLeish A. Hardy K.J. Shulkes A. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1142-1153Google Scholar) reported that 69% of colon cancers contain fully processed gastrin and that 100% have detectable amounts of progastrin, reflecting aberrant production of both gastrin and progastrin by colon cancer. Watson et al. (10Watson S.A. Michaeli D. Morris T.M. Clarke P. Varro A. Griffin N. Smith A. Justin T. Hardcastle J.D. Eur. J. Cancer. 1999; 35: 1286-1291Google Scholar, 11Watson S.A. Clarke P.A.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5902-5907Google Scholar) showed that immune neutralization of gastrin or its cognate receptor by antisera inhibits the growth, invasion, and metastasis of colorectal tumors. These findings suggest that gastrin plays a crucial role in colorectal cancer development; however, the molecular mechanisms have not been defined. Helicobacter pylori infects >50% of the world population, results in chronic antral gastritis with prolonged hypergastrinemia, and may play a role in development of gastric cancer (12Konturek S.J. Konturek P.C. Hartwich A. Hahn E.G. Regul. Pept. 2000; 93: 13-19Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that 85% of colorectal cancer patients have H. pylori infection and that these patients consistently overexpress COX-2 in the colonic cancer tissue, but not in normal mucosa, where only COX-1 is detected. These data suggest thatH. pylori infection may contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis by enhancing colonic expression of gastrin and COX-2 (12Konturek S.J. Konturek P.C. Hartwich A. Hahn E.G. Regul. Pept. 2000; 93: 13-19Google Scholar, 13Hartwich J. Konturek S.J. Pierzchalski P. Zuchowicz M. Konturek P.C. Bielanski W. Marlicz K. Starzynska T. Lawniczak M. Med. Sci. Monit. 2001; 7: 1171-1181Google Scholar). The fact that H. pylori induced hypergastrinemia is associated with increased COX-2 expression in gastric and colonic tissues suggests that gastrin may regulate COX-2 expression, but this possibility has not been confirmed (14Konturek S.J. Konturek P.C. Plonka A. Duda A. Sito E. Zuchowicz M. Hahn E.G. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2001; 66: 39-51Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to examine whether the activation of the cholecystokinin B receptor (CCK-BR) by gastrin leads to up-regulation of COX-2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells and, if so, to determine the signaling pathways linking CCK-BR to the expression of COX-2. To test this hypothesis, we developed a cell line derived from RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells transfected with human CCK-BR (RIE/CCKBR cells). Using this cell model, we report here, for the first time, that 1) gastrin significantly stimulates COX-2 expression; 2) this action requires ligand-independent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); and 3) up-regulation of the ERK5/MEF2 pathway is involved. In addition, gastrin activates other MAPK-dependent pathways and increases the expression and activities of other transcription factors such as ELK-1, activating transcription factor-2 (ATF2), c-Fos, c-Jun, and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Thus, our findings identify the signaling pathways coupling CCK-BR with up-regulation of COX-2 expression, which may contribute to gastrin-mediated gastrointestinal carcinogenesis, especially in the colon.

Anti-phospho-p38MAPK, anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-ELK-1, and anti-phospho-ATF2 antibodies were obtained fromCell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The anti-phospho-ERK5 antibody was purchased from Sigma. The anti-EGFR and anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) antibodies were provided by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). RIE-1 cells were a gift from Dr. Kenneth D. Brown (Cambridge Research Station, Babraham, Cambridge, UK) and were transfected with human CCK-BR using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. G418-resistant colonies were selected as described previously (18Guo Y.-S. Jin G.-F. Houston C.W. Thompson J.C. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 175: 141-148Google Scholar). The number of binding sites (Bmax) and their binding affinities (Kd) were determined using125I-labeled gastrin binding assays as described (19Guo Y.-S. Beauchamp R.D. Jin G.-F. Townsend Jr., C.M.

Agonist-induced changes in [Ca2+]i were detected using the Ca2+-sensitive dye Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probe, Inc., Eugene, OR) as previously described (17Guo Y.-S. Hellmich M.R. Wen X.D. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22941-22947Google Scholar). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 400 μg/ml Geneticin (G418, Invitrogen).

RNA samples (30 μg/lane) were separated on formaldehyde-containing 1.25% agarose gels and blotted onto Nytran Plus filters (Schleicher & Schüll). The blots were hybridized with cDNA probes labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random primer extension. Specific hybridization was visualized by autoradiography. To ensure RNA integrity and to confirm equal loading between lanes, the filters were stripped and rehybridized with a probe for 18 S rRNA. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (17Guo Y.-S. Hellmich M.R. Wen X.D. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22941-22947Google Scholar, 18Guo Y.-S. Jin G.-F.

The cells were lysed for 30 min on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cellular proteins were denatured by heating, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with the indicated antibodies and then with peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). RIE/CCKBR cells were plated in 24-well plates. Thirty-six hours later, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were then incubated with or without gastrin for the indicated times. The medium was collected from each well and analyzed for PGE2 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cayman Chemical Co., Inc.). RIE/CCKBR cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. After overnight adhesion, cells were transfected with 2 μg of promoter-luciferase reporter DNA and 0.02 μg of pRL-TKluc vector (Promega) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prior to assaying for luciferase activity, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum (24 h) and treated with gastrin for 6 h. Luciferase activity in 20 μl of cell extract was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) with a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The activity of the pRL-TKluc plasmid is distinguished from that of the other firefly luciferase reporters and was used to normalize for variation in transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (17Guo Y.-S. Hellmich M.R. Wen X.D. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22941-22947Google Scholar).

The double-stranded oligonucleotide of the MEF2 DNA-binding site in the mouse COX-2 promoter (CATTTCATTAAAAATAGAAGAA) was synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. (The Woodlands, TX). The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction mixtures contained 50,000 cpm of 32P-end-labeld oligonucleotide, 20 μg of nuclear protein extract, and 1.0 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences) in a final volume of 20 μl. Reaction mixtures were resolved on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 200 V for 2 h. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. All experiments were repeated on at least three separate occasions. Results from Northern and Western blotting were quantified by densitometry. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between means were compared using the analysis of variance test and were considered significantly different at p < 0.05. To determine whether gastrin can regulate endogenous COX-2 expression in RIE-1 cells, cells were stably transfected with an expression vector containing a human CCK-BR cDNA downstream of the cytomegalovirus promoter. After selection with G418, surviving cell clones were evaluated for the level of receptor expression using radiolabeled ligand binding and Ca2+ imaging with the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2/AM. The binding affinity of 125I-gastrin was calculated in terms of the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) from the Scatchard plot of specific binding data. The clone of RIE/CCKBR cells used in this study exhibits aKd value of 0.3 nm with 8000 binding sites/cell. Fura-2 imaging experiments revealed that >92 and 97% of these cells exhibited an increase in [Ca2+]i upon stimulation with 1 and 100 nm gastrin, respectively (Fig. 1, B–E). Gastrin significantly induced time- and dose-dependent increases in the expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein in RIE/CCKBR cells. Compared with untreated cells, the steady-state COX-2 mRNA levels increased in cells treated with gastrin (100 nm) by 2.8-, 3.8-, 4.5-, 5.6-, and 1.3-fold at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 2A). Gastrin also increased COX-2 mRNA abundance in a dose-dependent fashion. Treatment with 1 and 10 nm gastrin for 8 h revealed 3.2- and 4.8-fold increases in COX-2 mRNA abundance, respectively, whereas 100 and 1000 nm induced maximum responses (6.8-fold) (Fig. 2B). Moreover, gastrin treatment evoked a time-dependent increase in COX-2 protein levels. Western blots exhibited no detectable expression of COX-2 protein in untreated RIE/CCKBR cells, but showed an increase in COX-2 protein by 6 h, reaching a maximum intensity at 12–24 h after stimulation (Fig. 2C). COX converts arachidonic acid, released from the cell lipid bilayer by the action of phospholipase A2, to prostaglandin H2, the common precursor of all prostaglandins (1Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Google Scholar). To examine whether increased COX-2 expression is associated with elevated prostaglandin synthesis, the levels of PGE2 released from RIE/CCKBR cells were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Compared with untreated control cultures, PGE2levels in the medium of RIE/CCKBR cells treated with gastrin rose 1.3-fold at 12 h and continued to increase to 6.2-fold at 48 h (Fig. 2D). COX-2 expression is controlled by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (17Guo Y.-S. Hellmich M.R. Wen X.D. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22941-22947Google Scholar, 20Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Google Scholar, 21Sheng H. Shao J. Dixon D.A. Williams C.S. Prescott S.M. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6628-6635Google Scholar). To determine whether gastrin regulates COX-2 promoter activity, RIE/CCKBR cells were transfected with different sized fragments of the mouse COX-2 promoter coupled with a luciferase reporter gene. Gastrin (100 nm) evoked a 3.2-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells transiently expressing TIS10L-luc (−963/+70) compared with untreated control cultures. A 2.0-fold induction was observed when using a shorter fragment of the COX-2 promoter (TIS10−80luc, −80/+70). Gastrin did not stimulate an increase in luciferase activity in cells containing the shortest COX-2 promoter construct (TIS10−40luc, −40/+70) (Fig. 2E). Thus, these data demonstrate that CCK-BR-mediated signaling pathways are linked to regulation of COX-2 promoter activity in RIE/CCKBR cells. MAPK signal transduction pathways constitute one of the major mechanisms by which extracellular stimuli are converted into specific nuclear responses. Four families of MAPK kinases have been identified, including the ERKs (which were initially known simply as MAPKs), JNK, p38MAPK, and big MAPK1 (BMK1 or ERK5). These kinases are regulated by their upstream specific MAPK kinases,i.e. MEK1, MKK4/7, MKK3/6, and MEK5, respectively (22Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Google Scholar). To determine whether gastrin activates MAPK pathways in RIE/CCKBR cells, the levels of phosphorylation of the four MAPKs were determined by immunoblotting. We found that gastrin treatment stimulated the activation all of four MAPKs (Fig. 3). Western blots of RIE/CCKBR cell extracts, probed with antibodies selective for phosphorylated (activated forms) ERK1 and ERK2, showed that gastrin induced a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 (Fig. 3A). This phosphorylation was increased 1 min after gastrin administration and reached a peak at 5 min before returning to the base-line level at 15 and 30 min. A second peak was detected at 60 min and was maintained at the same level for 120 min (Fig. 3A). The second peak may result from EGFR transactivation (phosphorylation) induced by gastrin because preincubation with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 prevented the gastrin-elicited second peak (Fig. 3B), but not the first peak (data not shown), of ERK activation. Moreover, gastrin induced a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR (Fig. 3C). Gastrin also increased the phosphorylation of p38MAPK in a time-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of p38MAPK increased from 1 to 30 min and decreased thereafter (Fig. 3D). In addition, JNK activity was stimulated by gastrin. JNK phosphorylation was first noted at 1 min, reached peak levels at 5–15 min, and then returned to the basal level (Fig. 3E). The active status of JNK was further confirmed by a transactivation luciferase assay. We cotransfected RIE/CCKBR cells with an expression vector for the transactivation domain of c-Jun fused with the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 together with the Gal4-luc construct, a luciferase reporter gene under the control of five Gal4-responsive elements. In this system, Gal4-c-Jun can transactivate and stimulate luciferase activity only if serines 63 and 73 of c-Jun are phosphorylated by JNK and thus provide an indirect measure of JNK (23Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3F, gastrin induced a 4.2-fold increase in luciferase activity in cells transfected with wild-type Gal4-c-Jun, but not with its mutant (serines 63 and 73 of c-Jun in the Gal4-c-Jun plasmid changed to alanines). In addition, ERK5 may participate in gastrin-dependent signaling transduction in RIE/CCKBR cells. ERK5, a novel type of MAPK with 816 amino acids, is about twice the size of other MAPKs, is regulated by activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and oxidative stresses, and is phosphorylated by MEK5 (16Coso O.A. Montaner S. Fromm C. Lacal J.C. Prywes R. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20691-20697Google Scholar, 24Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Google Scholar). Whether gastrin activates ERK5 has not been reported. Immunoblotting using the anti-phospho-ERK5 antibody demonstrated that ERK5 phosphorylation after gastrin treatment was detected as early as 1 min, continued to increase up to 30 min, and declined subsequently (Fig. 3G). To determine whether MAPK activation is required for gastrin-induced COX-2 gene expression, RIE/CCKBR cells were pretreated for 30 min with selective inhibitors of MEK (PD98059) and p38MAPK(SB203580). PD98059 (10 μm) and SB203580 (5 μm) significantly suppressed gastrin-stimulated COX-2 mRNA abundance and promoter activity (Fig. 4, A and B). Because the gastrin-mediated ERK phosphorylation resulted partly from transactivation of EGFR (Fig. 3, A–C), we next examined the role of AG1487 in COX-2 protein expression using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4C, AG1487 inhibited, but not completely, gastrin-stimulated COX-2 protein levels. Moreover, in cells cotransfected with a vector containing the COX-2 promoter coupled with a luciferase reporter gene and a dominant-negative mutant vector for JNK or for MEK5, we found that these dominant-negative vectors significantly inhibited gastrin-elicited COX-2 promoter activity compared with the control cultures cotransfected with empty vector (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results suggest that transactivation of the EGFR-, MEK/ERK1/2-, p38MAPK-, JNK-, and MEK5/ERK5-dependent pathways is involved in CCK-BR-mediated regulation of COX-2 gene expression. The COX-2 promoter contains multiple potentialcis-activating elements. To date, AP-1, cAMP-responsive element, E-box, NF-IL6 (CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β), and NF-κB transcriptional elements have been reported to be involved in receptor-mediated COX-2 expression (17Guo Y.-S. Hellmich M.R. Wen X.D. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22941-22947Google Scholar, 20Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Google Scholar, 25Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Google Scholar). Additionally, numerous other cis-activating consensus sequences have been identified within the COX-2 promoter, including AP-2, SP-1, MEF2, STAT1, and STAT3 sites (20Xie W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31742-31748Google Scholar, 25Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Google Scholar). Whether these cis-elements contribute to gastrin-induced COX-2 transcription is unknown. In several cell models, gastrin is a potent stimulator of the AP-1 transcription factor complex (26Hocker M. Zhang Z. Merchant J.L. Wang T.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G822-G830Google Scholar, 27Stepan V.M. Tatewaki M. Matsushima M. Dickinson C.J. del Valle J. Todisco A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G415-G424Google Scholar). The AP-1 complex is composed of either homodimers of Jun protein or heterodimers of Jun and Fos proteins, which bind to a specific DNA consensus sequence (TGA(C/G)TCA) (28Pennypacker K.R. Hong J.S. McMillian M.K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 475-478Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using an end-labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the AP-1-binding consensus sequence showed an increase in AP-1-binding activity with gastrin (Fig. 5A). The AP-1-binding activity stimulated by gastrin was detected by 2 h, reached a maximum at 4 h, and diminished thereafter. To ensure specificity of binding, a competition experiment was performed using a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe, which effectively competed the protein-DNA band (Fig. 5A, lane 6). Gastrin-stimulated expression of c-fos and c-junmRNAs preceded the increase in AP-1-binding activity. The mRNA abundance of both transcription factors was rapidly increase at 0.5 h and declined after 1–2 h of stimulation (Fig. 5B). Moreover, RIE/CCKBR cells transfected with luciferase gene reporters driven by either the serum response element located in the c-fos gene promoter or the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element within the c-jun gene promoter showed 1.8- and 2.2-fold increases in luciferase activity, respectively, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 5C), indicating that gastrin transactivated the activities of the c-fos and c-jun promoters. Expression of the c-fos and c-jun genes is regulated, in part, by ternary complex factors and ATF2, respectively. Ternary complex factors belong to the Ets domain family of DNA-binding proteins, including ELK-1, Sap-1A, and Sap-1B. The phosphorylation of ELK-1 or Sap-1 by MAPKs increases its ability to form complexes with the serum response factor and results in serum response element-dependent activation of the c-fospromoter (29Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Google Scholar, 30Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of ATF2 by p38MAPKand JNK increases the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element-dependent transcriptional activity of c-jun (29Janknecht R. Cahill M.A. Nordheim A. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 443-450Google Scholar). To determine whether these transcription factors are involved in gastrin signaling, we determined the effect of gastrin on their phosphorylation state using antibodies directed against the phosphorylated (activated) forms of ELK-1 and ATF2. The phosphorylated ELK-1 was detected 1 min after gastrin treatment and was maintained at higher levels at 5–10 min before returning to the base-line level at 15 and 30 min, followed by an increase again at 60 min and a second peak at 90–120 min (Fig. 6A). Interestingly, the time course of ELK-1 phosphorylation is parallel to that observed for ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by gastrin (Fig. 3A). Gastrin-activated ATF2 was observed within 5 min, reached a maximum at 30 min, and then returned to the basal level (Fig. 6B). To further confirm these findings, we examined the effect of gastrin on the transactivation of these factors. RIE/CCKBR cells were cotransfected with plasmids carrying genes for fusion proteins, including Gal4-ELK-1, Gal4-Sap-1, and Gal4-ATF2, and the 5×Gal4-luc reporter genes. As shown in Fig. 6C, ELK-1- and ATF2-dependent (but not Sap-1-dependent) reporter gene expression was activated by gastrin. Together, these results indicate that gastrin activates transcription factors ELK-1 and ATF2, which may participate in the regulation of gastrin-dependent c-fos and c-junexpression in RIE/CCKBR cells. To ascertain whether AP-1 activation is required for gastrin-mediated COX-2 expression, we treated RIE/CCKBR cells with diferuloylmethane (curcumin), which is an inhibitor of AP-1 binding (17Guo Y.-S. Hellmich M.R. Wen X.D. Townsend Jr., C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22941-22947Google Scholar, 31Mohan R. Sivak J. Ashton P. Russo L.A. Pham B.Q. Kasahara N. Raizman M.B. Fini M.E. J. Biol.

In addition, there may be leukocyte inclusions, deafness, cataracts, and nephritis, depending on the syndrome. Mutations in the human nonmuscle myosin IIA heavy chain gene (MYH9) have been linked to these diseases. Two of the recently described mutations, N93K and R702C, are conserved in smooth and nonmuscle myosins from vertebrates and lie in the head domain of myosin. Interestingly, the two mutations lie within close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of myosin. These two mutations were engineered into a heavy meromyosin-like recombinant fragment of nonmuscle myosin IIA, which was expressed in baculovirus along with the appropriate light chains. The R702C mutant displays 25% of the maximal MgATPase activity of wild type heavy meromyosin and moves actin filaments at half the wild type rate. The effects of the N93K mutation are more dramatic. This heavy meromyosin has only 4% of the maximal MgATPase activity of wild type and does not translocate actin filaments in an in vitro motility assay. Biochemical characterization of the mutant is consistent with this mutant being unable to fully adopt the “on” conformation.

There are at least three isoforms of the conventional (class II) nonmuscle myosins in humans, termed nonmuscle myosin (NM) 1The abbreviations used for: NM, nonmuscle myosin; HMM, heavy meromyosin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; WT, wild type; ELC, essential light chain. IIA (NMIIA), IIB (NMIIB), and IIC (NMIIC) (1Simons M. Wang M. McBride O.W. Kawamoto S. Yamakawa K. Gdula D. Adelstein R.S. Weir L. Circ.

Like all conventional myosins, these are hexameric proteins composed of two heavy chains and two pairs of light chains. The carboxyl-terminal half of each of the heavy chains dimerize to form a coiled-coil α helix, whereas the amino-terminal half forms a globular head region that binds the light chains, interacts with actin, and hydrolyzes ATP. The heavy chains of these three myosins are products of distinct genes (MYH9 for NMIIA and MYH10 for NMIIB in humans; the gene name for the heavy chain of NMIIC has not yet been assigned) (1Simons M.

Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Whereas most cells express multiple myosin II isoforms, platelets express exclusively NMIIA (3Kawamoto S. Adelstein R.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). 2R. S. Adelstein, personal communication. Recently, mutations in the MYH9 gene have been linked to a number of human disorders involving platelets such as May-Hegglin anomaly, Fechtner syndrome, and Sebastian syndrome (4The May-Hegglin/Fechtner Syndrome Consortium Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 5Kelley M.J. Jawien W. Ortel T.L. Korczak J.F. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). May-Hegglin anomaly is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder characterized by abnormally large platelets, leukocyte inclusions, and thrombocytopenia, which predisposes the patients to bleeding disorders (6Mhawech P. Saleem A. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2000; 113: 176-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sebastian and Fechtner syndromes share these features, and Fechtner syndrome patients also have sensorineural deafness, cataracts, and nephritis. Recently, other studies have linked mutations in MYH9 to a human nonsyndromic hereditary deafness, DFNA17 and to Epstein and Alpert-like syndromes (7Lalwani A.K. Goldstein J.A. Kelley M.J. Luxford W.

We have co-expressed a fragment of the nonmuscle myosin IIA heavy chain (9Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol.

The in vitro activities of these two mutant myosins were compared with that of wild type myosin. Significant impairments were detected in both mutants. The N93K mutation was associated with a tendency for the myosin to aggregate, which may explain the leukocyte inclusions associated with this mutation in humans. A recombinant HMM-like protein of human nonmuscle myosin IIA was expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system according to Wang et al. (10Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cDNA for wild type human nonmuscle myosin IIA (accession number M81105) was truncated at codon 1337 to create an HMM-like fragment. Nucleotides coding for a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) followed by a stop signal were appended to aid purification. The HMM-like construct was subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate two mutant constructs. For the N93K mutant HMM, the nucleotides coding for Asn at codon 93 were mutated to nucleotides coding for Lys using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). The primers used were 5′-GGCAGAGCTCACGTGCCTCAAGGAAGCCTCGGTGCTGCAC-3′ and the complementary antisense primer. The mutated nucleotide, shown in bold, converts Asn to Lys. Similarly, for the R702C mutant HMM, Arg-702 was mutated to Cys using the primers 5′-GCAACGGTGTTCTCGAGGGCATCTGTATCTGCCGCCAGGGCTTCC-3′ and the complementary antisense primer. The complete nucleotide sequence of the mutant cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The wild type and mutant recombinant HMMs of human nonmuscle myosin IIA were expressed along with regulatory and essential light chains in the baculovirus/Sf9 system and purified according to Wang et al. (10Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The proteins were either used fresh or were frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. The concentration was determined by the Bradford assay using smooth muscle heavy meromyosin as a standard (11Sellers J.R. Chock P.B. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14181-14188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myosin light chain kinase (12Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B.

Chem. 1990; 265: 14864-14869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared as previously described. Approximately 10 mg of wild type HMM could be routinely purified from 4 × 109 Sf9 cells, but the yield of soluble N93K mutant was typically about 0.2–2% of this amount. Western blot analyses of the Sf9 cell pellets prior to extraction of the N93K mutant demonstrated that normal amounts of the protein were being expressed, but subsequent extraction revealed that most of this was not solubilized by the extraction buffer. The actin-activated MgATPase activity was measured using the method of Pollard and Korn (16Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 35 °C in 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM MOPS (pH 7.0). The actin concentration was typically varied from 0.5 to 30 μm. The kinetic constants, V maxand K ATPase (the actin concentration required for half maximal activation of the MgATPase activity), were determined by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). The K+EDTA ATPase activity was measured in 0.5 M KCl, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), and 1 mM ATP at 35 °C. The in vitro motility of the HMM fragments were measured as described (10Wang F.

The conditions were 80 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM ATP, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.4), 200 nM tropomyosin, 0.7% methylcellulose, 2.5 mg/ml glucose, 0.1 mg/ml glucose oxidase, and 2 mg/ml catalase at 30 °C. The enzymatic properties of a nonmuscle myosin II HMM-like fragment expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system have been previously characterized and shown to be an excellent model for the tissue-purified protein (10Wang F.

In this report, two separate point mutations in the myosin heavy chain (N93K and R702C) corresponding to mutations recently reported in some families with May-Hegglin anomaly and Fechtner syndrome were separately engineered into this background (4The May-Hegglin/Fechtner Syndrome Consortium Nat.

The unmutated HMM will be referred to as WT-HMM, and the HMMs bearing either one of the two mutations will be referred to as R702C-HMM and N93K-HMM. All three proteins were expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 system (Fig. 1). Both mutants bound regulatory and essential light chains in the same ratios with the heavy chain as was found in WT-HMM. The amounts of N93K-HMM obtained were variable due to the fact that most of it tended to be in an unextractable form in the Sf9 cells, and the protein that was purified aggregated during and after purification. The enzymatic activity was initially accessed by measuring the MgATPase activities of the three proteins in the absence of actin (TableI). For all three proteins, this activity was very low (<0.007 s−1). Because the enzymatic activity of NMIIA is known to be regulated by light chain phosphorylation, the samples were treated with myosin light chain kinase. Glycerol gel electrophoresis of the kinase-treated samples revealed that the regulatory light chains of each of the myosins incorporated a single mole of phosphate per mole (data not shown). The MgATPase activity of phosphorylated WT-HMM, as expected, was greatly activated by actin (Fig. 2). That of R702C-HMM was activated to a lesser extent, whereas the activity of N93K-HMM was barely activated by actin (Fig. 2). The data for each HMM was fitted to the Michael-Menten equation to determine the kinetic constants,V max and K ATPase (TableI). The V max of R702C-HMM was about 25% of that of WT-HMM, and its K ATPase was slightly lower than that of WT-HMM. In contrast, the V max of N93K HMM was less than 5% of that of wild type. The low activity was not a result of the protein becoming dephosphorylated during the course of the assay, as it retained its original level of phosphorylation during the ATPase time course (data not shown). To determine whether the cause of the low activity of N93K was due to gross denaturation of the protein, the nonphysiological K+ATPase activity was measured. The data in Table I show that the N93K-HMM had an even higher K+ EDTA ATPase activity than WT-HMM or R702C-HMM, indicating that the protein was able to bind and hydrolyze nucleotides under these conditions and was, therefore, not denatured. The low activity of the N93K HMM could possibly be due to the inability to be activated by light chain phosphorylation. The MgATPase activities of all three HMM molecules in the unphosphorylated state were measured in the presence of 30 μm actin. The MgATPase activities of unphosphorylated WT-HMM (0.039 s−1) and R702C-HMM (0.016 s−1) were much lower than that of their phosphorylated forms, indicating that the enzymatic activity of these proteins was well regulated. The activity of unphosphorylated N93K-HMM (0.012 s−1) was similarly low but was only increased 2–3-fold by phosphorylation.Table IATPase activities of human nonmuscle myosin IIA wild type and mutant HMM moleculesHuman nonmuscle myosin IIA HMMBasal MgATPasepHMM Actin-Activated MgATPaseupHMM K+-EDTA ATPasepHMMupHMMV maxK ATPases−1s−1s−1μms−1Wild type<0.007<0.0070.92 ± 0.158.4 ± 1.50.47 ± 0.13R702C<0.007<0.0070.20 ± 0.053.0 ± 0.140.42 ± 0.20N93K<0.007<0.0070.03 ± 0.0021.7 ± 0.200.54 ± 0.14 Open table in a new tab An important property of myosin is its ability to translocate actin. This can be measured in an in vitro motility assay using rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin filaments. WT-HMM translocated actin filaments at a rate of 0.28 μm/s when phosphorylated (Fig.3). In the absence of phosphorylation, WT-HMM did not move actin filaments. Phosphorylated R702C-HMM translocated actin filaments at about one-half the velocity of WT-HMM (Fig. 3). In contrast, no movement of actin filaments was observed for phosphorylated N93K-HMM, but actin filaments did remain bound to the surface (Fig. 3). An experiment in which phosphorylated N93K-HMM and rabbit skeletal muscle HMM are mixed in the motility assay affords a means to better examine the nature of the low activity of N93K-HMM. There are several alternative explanations for its low activity. First, it is possible that most (96%) of the myosin is totally inactivated with respect to its enzymatic activity and that 4% of the myosin retains the activity of wild type myosin. Chemical modification of smooth and skeletal muscle myosins can generate such a condition. Typically these inactivated myosins still retain the ability to bind tightly to actin and have a diminished K+EDTA ATPase activity measured under nonphysiological conditions (18Harris D.E. Work S.S. Wright R.K. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). When such inactivated myosins are mixed with actively cycling myosins in the in vitro motility assay, even small amounts of the inactivated myosins are sufficient to arrest the movement of the actively cycling myosins (18Harris D.E. Work S.S. Wright R.K. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Dramatic shearing of the actin filaments also occurs in this case. Neither of these phenomena occurred when phosphorylated N93K-HMM was mixed with rabbit skeletal muscle HMM (Fig. 4,triangles) or with phosphorylated WT-HMM (data not shown). Coupled with the observation that N93K-HMM had a K+EDTA ATPase activity that is similar to that of WT-HMM further argues against the possibility that this mutation merely results in a dead, rigor-like myosin that would account for the low enzymatic activity (Table I). Second, the mutation could render the HMM incapable of interacting with actin. This can be ruled out on the basis that when phosphorylated N93K-HMM alone is applied to the coverslip surface, actin filaments remain bound (though not moving) even in the presence of ATP. Third, the mutation may have simply slowed the rate-limiting step for the kinetic cycle of the mutant such that it is only 4% that of WT-HMM, but the mutant myosin is otherwise proceeding through its cross-bridge cycle as a myosin should, and is possibly even moving actin filaments at such a slow rate so as to be undetectable by our methods. The rate that would be predicted by this explanation, 10 nm/s, should be detectable in our assay and was not observed. Cudaet al. (19Cuda G. Pate E. Cooke R. Sellers J.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1767-1779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and Harris et al. (18Harris D.E. Work S.S. Wright R.K. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) demonstrated that when two actively cycling myosins with different inherent rates of motility are mixed in the motility assay, the more slowly cycling myosin dominates the velocity. Phosphorylated N93K-HMM did not dominantly retard the movement of skeletal muscle HMM in the experiment shown in Fig. 4, further suggesting that the mutation has not merely rendered the HMM a very slow but otherwise normal motor. As a control, we show that phosphorylated WT-HMM, as expected, does dominantly retard the movement of rabbit skeletal muscle HMM (Fig. 4, circles). Fourth, it is possible the N93K mutation does not allow the HMM to fully adopt the active state upon phosphorylation, and thus the molecule mostly remains in an inhibited state that is able to interact weakly with actin filaments but cannot support their movement. The behavior of noncyclying unphosphorylated smooth and nonmuscle myosins when mixed with an actively cycling myosin has also been studied and modeled (18Harris D.E. Work S.S. Wright R.K. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar,19Cuda G. Pate E. Cooke R. Sellers J.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1767-1779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The unphosphorylated noncycling myosins impose a load on the actively cycling myosins but do so in a non-dominant manner. As a control, we show in Fig. 4 that unphosphorylated WT-HMM has such an effect on rabbit skeletal muscle HMM (squares). This is also the behavior observed when phosphorylated N93K-HMM was mixed with skeletal muscle HMM, which supports the latter case that this mutation is not able to adopt the “on” conformation (Fig. 4,triangles). Platelets are unusual in that the only myosin II isoform they contain is the nonmuscle myosin IIA isoform, whereas most cells express at least nonmuscle myosin IIB and sometimes nonmuscle myosin IIC, in addition to nonmuscle myosin IIA (20Sellers J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 3-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In platelets, myosin and actin form a dense cortical meshwork (21Hartwig J.H. DeSisto M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 407-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The linkage of mutations in MYH9 (the heavy chain gene for nonmuscle myosin IIA) to several related human disorders, such as May-Hegglin anomaly, Sebastian syndrome, Fechtner syndrome, Alport syndrome, and Epstein syndrome, involving abnormalities in platelets and leukocytes is therefore not surprising (4The May-Hegglin/Fechtner Syndrome Consortium Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 5Kelley M.J. Jawien W. Ortel T.L. Korczak J.F. Nat.

Fechtner, Alport, and Epstein syndrome patients also display sensorineural deafness and nephritis. Interestingly, another MYH9 mutation (R705H) not examined here was linked to DFNA17, a nonsyndromic hereditary deafness with no apparent involvement of platelets (7Lalwani A.K. Goldstein J.A. Kelley M.J. Luxford W. Castelein C.M. Mhatre A.N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, mutations inMYH9 account for these phenotypically distinct MYHIIA syndrome disease and are important in the pathogenesis of macrothromocytopenia, sensorineural deafness, cataracts, and nephritis. Two of the reported MYH9 mutations, N93K and R702C, were engineered into the heavy chain of human nonmuscle myosin IIA. The heavy chain cDNA was truncated at codon 1377 and tagged with the FLAG epitope at the carboxyl terminus to express a soluble HMM-like fragment that could be easily affinity purified (10Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The expression of the HMM fragment was chosen as it is typically soluble at low ionic strengths, which affords ease in kinetic experiments, retains the regulatory behavior of the whole myosin, and has been shown to express well in the baculovirus/Sf9 system (10Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the case of both mutations, homodimers with the same mutation on each heavy chain were generated. Both of these mutations are autosomal-dominant in humans (8Heath K.E. Campos-Barros A. Toren A. Rozenfeld-Granot G. Carlsson L.E. Savige J. Denison J.C. Gregory M.C. White J.G. Barker D.F. Greinacher A. Epstein C.J. Glucksman M.J. Martignetti J.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1033-1045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 22Kunishima S. Kojima T. Matsushita T. Tanaka T. Tsurusawa M. Furukawa Y. Nakamura Y. Okamura T. Amemiya N. Nakayama T. Kamiya T. Saito H. Blood. 2001; 97: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that an affected individual may have both homodimeric as well as heterodimeric molecules (with respect to the mutation). Assuming random association of the heavy chains in the cell, ∼50% of the myosin molecules should be heterodimeric and have one mutant and one wild type heavy chain. The rest should be homodimers with two mutant heavy chains (25%) or with wild type heavy chains (25%). If, however, the dimerization of the two heavy chains occurs at the time of translation on the ribosome, then homodimers of either the mutant myosin heavy chain or of the wild type heavy chain could be preferentially produced. It is also likely, in vivo, that mutant molecules co-polymerized into filaments with wild type myosin molecules could also impair the behavior of the otherwise normal wild type myosin. In our study only homodimeric molecules (with respect to their mutation status) are produced. It would thus be expected that our study should give the extreme example of functional impairment of function. We did not address how an HMM with one normal heavy chain and one mutant heavy chain would behave in this study. Both mutations impaired the activity of the myosin, but to different degrees. The R702C mutation had the more modest effects. When phosphorylated, R702C-HMM exhibited about 25% of the maximal actin-activated MgATPase activity and moved actin filaments at about one-half the velocity of WT-HMM. In contrast, the impairment found with the N93K mutation was severe. This fragment had only about 4% of the maximal actin-activated MgATPase activity as WT-HMM and did not move actin filaments in the in vitro motility assay. Its MgATPase activity was barely activated by phosphorylation, and the mechanism for its impairment may be that it is unable to assume the active conformation. This mechanism is supported by the fact that phosphorylated N93K-HMM slows the movement of fast skeletal muscle HMM in a non-dominant manner, implying that it is able to interact with actin in the weakly bound state. This could occur if the mutation prevented the acceleration of release of products, particularly the release of Pi, as has been shown to occur in Dictyosteliummyosin bearing an E476K mutation, for example (23Friedman A.L. Geeves M.A. Manstein D.J. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9679-9687Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The coordinates of the three-dimensional structure of the highly homologous smooth muscle myosin (24Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) can be used as a model to locate the likely positions of the two May-Hegglin NMIIA mutants. Despite their distant positions in the primary sequence of the myosin heavy chain, N93 and R702 are located in close proximity in the myosin three-dimensional structure (Fig. 5). The sequence in Fig. 5 depicted in yellow is that of the so-called SH1 helix, a critical helical segment that unwinds at some stage during the myosin ATP hydrolysis cycle (25Houdusse A. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11238-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 26Bobkov A.A. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 460-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Most myosin crystal structures (including the one shown in Fig. 5) show this region to be helical, but in a recent report (25Houdusse A. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11238-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) on a scallop S1-MgADP complex this helix was shown to be unwound. Its disruption is linked to a state in which the subdomains of myosin are not tightly coupled and is thought to represent myosin in a detached state that would be unable to bind strongly to actin (25Houdusse A. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11238-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Arg-702 lies directly within the SH1 helix (orange atoms), and Asn-93 (magenta atoms) lies in close proximity on an adjacent helix (Fig. 5). Arg-702 is highly conserved in most classes of myosin and is invariant in the conventional myosin II class (27Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). In smooth muscle, it forms a side chain hydrogen bond with a conserved glutamine residue located four amino acids down stream (Asn-706 in nonmuscle IIA), which would probably not occur in the mutant form. This would probably result in destabilization of the SH1 helix. Asn-93 is well conserved among vertebrate nonmuscle and smooth muscle myosins (although not universally conserved within the myosin II subclass) (27Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). It lies on helix C within the amino-terminal segment of the heavy chain that abuts the SH1 helical segment (28Cope M.J.T.V. Whisstock J. Rayment I. Kendrick-Jones J. Structure. 1996; 4: 969-987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Helix C makes several important stabilizing contacts with SH1 helix (25Houdusse A. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11238-11243Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Asn-93 hydrogen bonds with Ser-96, and mutation to the bulkier lysine would likely destabilize helix C, which, in turn, could weaken its interactions with and destabilize the SH1 helix. If the SH1 helix were unwound, the subdomains of myosin would be loosely coupled and hence incapable of generating a power stroke. The severity of the mutation on enzymatic function serves to highlight the importance of this critical region of myosin. Interestingly, two other MYHIIA syndrome mutations have been identified that are also located near the SH1 helix region, R705H (7Lalwani A.K. Goldstein J.A. Kelley M.J. Luxford W. Castelein C.M. Mhatre A.N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 1121-1128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and A95T (29Kunishima S. Matsushita T. Kojima T. Amemiya N. Choi Y.M. Hosaka N. Inoue M. Jung Y. Mamiya S. Matsumoto K. Miyajima Y. Zhang G. Ruan C. Saito K. Song K.S. Yoon H.J. Kamiya T. Saito H. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 46: 722-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although there are many mutations that have been engineered into either Dictyostelium or smooth muscle myosins that dramatically slow the actin-activated MgATPase activity, none of these are located in a comparable position to Asn-93 in nonmuscle myosin II (27Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). There are disease-causing mutations in human β-cardiac myosin that lie in proximity to the SH1 helix, but these are not found in the amino terminus (27Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). The primary effects of these mutations are seen in platelets where there is no compensating nonmuscle myosin IIB present. The process of platelet formation from megakaryocytes is still poorly understood. Recent results suggest that they originate from intermediate proplatelet structures on the megarkaryocytes (30Italiano Jr., J.E. Lecine P. Shivdasani R.A. Hartwig J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1299-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The megakaryocytes of these patients have not yet been studied to determine whether their proplatelet-like processes are abnormally large. The giant platelet phenotype found in association with the mutation suggests a role for NMIIA in the process of platelet formation. Most of the MYHIIA syndrome disease phenotypes include the presence of inclusion bodies in leukocytes. Recently, these inclusion bodies were found to contain aggregated nonmuscle myosin II by immunocytochemical staining (22Kunishima S. Kojima T. Matsushita T. Tanaka T. Tsurusawa M. Furukawa Y. Nakamura Y. Okamura T. Amemiya N. Nakayama T. Kamiya T. Saito H. Blood. 2001; 97: 1147-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our observation that N93K-HMM tends to aggregate in solution. The R702C mutation has been found in several different families. In some of these families no leukocyte inclusions are found, which is consistent with our observation that this mutation is more soluble. The aggregation observed in vitro with N93K-HMM was not reversible by increasing the ionic strength, and this suggests that the myosin aggregation seen in the leukocytes of the patients are probably also irreversible and cannot be depolymerized and repolymerized into filaments at different locations in the cell. It is not clear why one mutation (R702C) is associated with the added complications of Fechtner syndrome, which includes nephritis, sensineural deafness, and cataracts, whereas the other mutation (N93K) is only associated with the platelet and leukocyte disorders. Possibly, the tendency of N93K mutation to induce aggregation may actually serve to effectively remove this myosin from the cellular compartments where its lowered enzymatic activity would otherwise inhibit function. In this way the more severe mutation in vitro may not exert as great of an effect in the cell as the less severe R702C mutation, which is not always associated with cellular aggregations. Myosin II may be performing different tasks in these diverse cell types. The fact that a wide variety of other organs exhibit no apparent adverse effects of these mutations probably reflects a functional redundancy with NMIIB, NMIIC, and possibly other myosins. It is also likely that the genetic background plays a role in this distinction. We thank Drs. Robert Adelestein and John Martignetti for helpful discussions throughout the course of this study. We thank Estelle V. Harvey and Yue Zhang for excellent technical assistance. We are particularly indebted to Drs. Daniel Himmel and Carolyn Cohen for insight into the probable molecular defects of the mutations."

Moreover, these compounds were found to have cytostatic activity in human cancer cell lines (5Lee S.K. Cui B. Mehta R.R. Kinghorn A.D. Pezzuto J.M. Chem. Biol.

However, the one or more underlying molecular mechanisms of these rocaglamide mediated effects have not been identified. The members of the Rel/NF-κB transcription factor family bind to DNA as homo- and/or heterodimers. They are critically involved in the regulation of genes mediating inflammatory responses and cellular processes such as cell survival, apoptosis, development, differentiation, cell growth, and neoplastic transformation (reviewed in Ref. 10Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm due to the interaction with proteins of the IκB family. Stimulation of cells, e.g. by pro-inflammatory agents results in the rapid activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) 1The abbreviations used are: IKK, IκB kinase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; IκBα, inhibitor κBα; LT-β, lymphotoxin-β; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAF2, TNF receptor-associated protein 2; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; RocB, didesmethyl-rocaglamide B; NIK, NF-κB-inducing kinase; AP-1, activator protein.

This complex consists of two kinases IKK1/α and IKK2/β as well as a regulatory component called NEMO/IKK-γ (10Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar, 11Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109 (suppl.): S81-S96Google Scholar). Its activation results in thede novo phosphorylation of conserved serine residues in the N-terminal domain of the IκB proteins marking them for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. This allows nuclear translocation of NF-κB and binding to cognate DNA motifs in the promoter region of target genes, which subsequently initiates transcription of these genes and finally starts a genetic program responsible for e.g. inflammatory responses (12Denk A. Wirth T. Baumann B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 303-320Google Scholar). Numerous efforts have been initiated to develop or to identify specific low molecular weight compounds to inhibit this pathway (13Epinat J.C. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6896-6909Google Scholar, 14Garg A. Aggarwal B.B. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 1053-1068Google Scholar). Substances that inhibit the proteasome as well as radical scavengers have been shown to block NF-κB activation. These inhibitors have been valuable for many studies of NF-κB functions in cell culture systems. However, because these compounds also affect multiple other cellular reactions, they are not useful as therapeutic agents in vivo(13Epinat J.C. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6896-6909Google Scholar). Substances that either block the action of the IκB kinase complex or interfere with its activation are thought be more specific and should have fewer side effects. Recently, a novel reversible inhibitor of the proteasome, PS-341, a dipeptidyl boronic acid analogue, has been described to be a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation (15Palombella V.J. Conner E.M. Fuseler J.W. Destree A. Davis J.M. Laroux F.S. Wolf R.E. Huang J. Brand S. Elliott P.J. Lazarus D. McCormack T. Parent L. Stein R. Adams J. Grisham M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This compound has excellent bioavailability and stability and has been shown to yield effective anti-cancer responses both in vitro and in vivo (17Teicher B.A. Ara G. Herbst R. Palombella V.J.

Med. 2002; 8: S49-S54Google Scholar). In the past, several natural occurring compounds like sesquiterpene lactones, curcumin, tetrandrine, and triptolide have been shown to inhibit NF-κB activation (20Lyss G. Schmidt T.J. Merfort I.

However, their broad side effects and the relatively high doses required for NF-κB inhibition make them less feasible as therapeutic drugs (13Epinat J.C. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6896-6909Google Scholar). The rationale for studying a series of rocaglamide derivatives for their influence on NF-κB activity was based on the observation that leaves and flowers ofAglaia duperreana and Aglaia odorata are used in the traditional medicine of several countries from Southeast Asia (e.g. Vietnam) for the treatment of asthma and inflammatory skin diseases. Here we show that certain rocaglamide derivatives are efficient inhibitors of NF-κB activation and NF-κB target gene expression, which could explain the anti-inflammatory function of these herbal remedies. Interestingly, they show a high degree of cell type specificity being much more active in T lymphocytes than in other cell types. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-κB by rocaglamides is responsible for sensitization of resistant leukemic T cells toward cancer therapy induced apoptosis. The mechanism of NF-κB inhibition by rocaglamides is predominantly localized upstream of the IκB kinase complex. CEM-S (acute T cell leukemia) cells die rapidly in response to γ-irradiation, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents, or direct triggering of death receptors. Subclones of CEM-S have been selected from the parental cells by periodical triggering of CD95 with αAPO-1 (50 ng/ml to 10 μg/ml) for at least 1 year (28Friesen C. Herr I. Krammer P.H. Debatin K.M. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 574-577Google Scholar). These subclones (CEM-R) do not die in response to αAPO-1 and exhibit a strongly delayed percentage of apoptosis following γ-irradiation or treatment with chemotherapeutic agents. These cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biochrom, Hamburg, Germany), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 25 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine (all from Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Jurkat T and Jurkat T cells deficient in IKKγ/NEMO expression (kindly provided by S.-C. Sun, Pennsylvania State University), EL-4, HeLa, S107, NIH3T3, and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) containing 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Systems, Aidenbach, Germany), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). PC12 cells were cultured in the same medium but containing 10% horse serum (PAN Systems, Aidenbach, Germany), 5% fetal calf serum, and no β-mercaptoethanol. Cisplatin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 μg/μl, stored in aliquots at −80 °C and further diluted in medium to the working solution of 1 μm. PMA (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), Ionomycin (Calbiochem, Germany) and the various rocaglamide derivatives were also dissolved in Me2SO and used at the indicated concentrations. Human recombinant TNFα (a gift of Dr. G. Adolf, Boehringer Ingelheim, Vienna, Austria) was dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 200 mm sodium chloride, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and used at the indicated concentrations. Cells were γ-irradiated (10 Gy) in their flasks using a cesium radiator. For transient transfections, 3 μg of the NF-κB-dependent or the AP-1-dependent luciferase reporter and 50 ng ofRenilla luciferase reporter (under control of the ubiquitin promoter) or 1 μg of Rous sarcoma virus LacZ were cotransfected with 20 μg of empty vector (pcDNA3) or expression vectors for TRAF2, NIK, MEKK1, and IKK2-EE (29Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Google Scholar, 30Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Google Scholar, 31Malinin N.L. Boldin M.P. Kovalenko A.V.

Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 107) were transfected in 300 μl of culture medium by electroporation using a Bio-Rad gene pulser (Germany) at 975 microfarads (μFa) and 250 V (for Jurkat, A401, and EL-4) and at 250 μFa and 450 V (for HeLa). After electroporation cells were immediately resuspended in medium, seeded in six-well plates, and treated 16 h later as indicated. Cells were harvested 7 h later, and luciferase enzyme activity was measured. Renilla luciferase activity or β-galactosidase activity were used to normalize for differences in transfection efficiencies. For generation of stable transfectants of the Jurkat T and PC12 cell lines, cells were electroporated with 20 μg of the 3xκB.luc reporter plasmid together with 1 μg of a pSV.puro vector at 975 μFa and 250 V and at 250 μFa and 450 V, respectively. Cell clones with an integrated reporter gene were selected in medium containing 2 μg/ml (Jurkat) and 2.5 μg/ml (PC12) puromycin. Preparation of whole cell extracts was performed by the freeze-thaw method, and EMSAs were performed as described earlier (34Lernbecher T. Müller U. Wirth T. Nature. 1993; 365: 767-770Google Scholar). In all cases, whole cell extracts were incubated with radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a Ig-κ enhancer consensus NF-κB site, a octamer-specific site (35Wirth T. Staudt L. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 329: 174-178Google Scholar), or an Sp-1-specific site (5′-attcgatcggggcggggcgagc-3′) for 20 min at room temperature, and the DNA-protein complexes formed were then separated from free oligonucleotides on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel. For IKK activity assays, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (36Daub M. Jockel J. Quack T. Weber C.K. Schmitz F. Rapp U.R. Wittinghofer A. Block C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6698-6710Google Scholar), and the endogenous IKK complex was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of extract using IKK1/2-specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7607). The precipitated IKK complex was incubated in kinase assay mixture containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μCi of [γ-32]ATP and 600 ng of GST-IκBα substrate. Coupled in vitrokinase assays were performed in kinase assay mixture supplemented with 1 μm unlabeled ATP. After 20 min (30 °C) the reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample puffer, and the proteins were separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels. Finally, the gel was either dried or the proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and radioactive bands were visualized by phosphorimaging or autoradiography. Kinase activities were quantified by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) analysis. The membranes were used for immunoblot analysis as described elsewhere (37Denk A. Goebeler M. Schmid S. Berberich I. Ritz O. Lindemann D. Ludwig S. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28451-28458Google Scholar) and were labeled with antibodies specific for IKK1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7183) to determine total amounts of immunoprecipitated IKK1. Western immunoblot analysis for monitoring IκBα degradation and RelA expression were performed as described earlier (37Denk A. Goebeler M. Schmid S. Berberich I. Ritz O. Lindemann D. Ludwig S. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28451-28458Google Scholar) using IκBα (Cell Signaling, #9242)- and RelA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-372)-specific antibodies. Jurkat cells (10 × 106) were treated with PMA (50 ng/ml) and RocB (200 nm) as indicated. Total RNAs were extracted with the RNA INSTAPURE kit (Eurogentech, Belgium). The presence of the indicated transcripts was detected using RPA analysis using the Multi-Probe template sets (Pharmingen, Hamburg, Germany) hAPO-2b (Bcl family members), hAPO-3c (death receptor-related proteins), and hCK-3 (ligands). Probe synthesis, hybridization, and RNase treatment were performed with the RiboQuant Multi-Probe RNase Protection Assay system (Pharmingen). After RNase treatment, protected transcripts were resolved by electrophoresis on 5% urea-polyacrylamide-bis-acrylamide gels and visualized on a PhosphorImager with ImageQuaNT software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Early apoptotic changes were identified by staining of cells with fluorescein thiocyanate-conjugated annexin V and propidium iodide (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson) as described earlier (38Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6200-6208Google Scholar). Sixteen naturally occurring 1H-cyclopenta[b]benzofuran lignans of the rocaglamide type as well as one naturally occurring aglain congener were tested for their ability to inhibit NF-κB function. The different substances were isolated from various Aglaiaspecies as described earlier (3Nugroho B.W. Edrada R.A. Wray V. Witte L. Bringmann G. Gehling M. Proksch P. Phytochemistry. 1999; 51: 367-376Google Scholar). All compounds were prepared to at least 98% purity as assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. These compounds (named 1–16) differed mainly in their amide side chains and/or in the substitution patterns of aromatic rings A and B (Fig. 1). Jurkat T cells bearing an integrated NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter (3xκB.luc) served as a test system for NF-κB activity. Jurkat T cells were pre-treated with the different rocaglamide compounds at a concentration of 100 nm. One hour later the cells were stimulated with TNF, and at 6 h post-stimulation luciferase activities were determined. TNF stimulation resulted in a potent activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription (>30-fold). Interestingly we found that pretreatment of the Jurkat T cells with several of the different rocaglamide compounds led to inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity (Fig. 2 Aand data not shown). The most efficient inhibitors wereN,N-didesmethyl-N-4-hydroxybutyl-rocaglamide (compound 8), didesmethyl-rocaglamide (synonym with RocB, compound 1), and compounds 3 and 4. These substances show an inhibition activity ranging from 70% up to complete inhibition. Compounds 2, 5–7, 9–12, 14, and 15 are less powerful inhibitors that repress TNF-induced NF-κB- dependent luciferase activity to levels less than 50% (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). The aglain derivative (compound 17), 8β-methoxyrocaglaol (compound 13), and compound 16 were completely inactive even at concentrations up to 2 mm(Fig. 2 A and data not shown). We next investigated the dose dependence of the inhibition and determined the IC50 values for several rocaglamides following TNF treatment. All investigated active compounds showed a dose-dependent inhibition of TNF-induced NF-κB-driven gene expression. An example of the dose-dependent inhibition of the transcription factor NF-κB by RocB is shown in Fig.2 B. A complete inhibition of the transcription factor NF-κB-dependent gene expression in Jurkat T cells was observed, when the T-cells were treated with RocB at a concentration of 200 nm. The IC50 value was determined to be 58 nm, and several other compounds showed IC50values in the range of 200 nm (TableI).Table IIC50 values of rocaglamides for the inhibition of TNF-α and PMA-induced NF-κB activity in Jurkat T cellsRocaglamidesTNF-α nMPMA[1]58.443.6[9]161.3197.4[11]208.0499.0[14]205.0319.4[15]159.9243.4 Open table in a new tab A wide variety of stimuli has been shown to induce NF-κB activity. We therefore asked whether rocaglamides would specifically inhibit TNFα-induced NF-κB or whether they might also interfere with PMA-induced NF-κB activation. RocB (compound 1) was able to inhibit PMA stimulation in the same concentration range as shown for TNFα stimulation. Other rocaglamide congeners were somewhat less efficient in their inhibitory action for PMA-induced NF-κB activity. IC50 values of five rocaglamide derivatives were determined for their inhibition of PMA stimulation (Table I). The aglain derivative and 8β-methoxyrocaglaol were again completely inactive up to the final concentration tested. Our results demonstrate that, depending on their chemical structure, rocaglamide derivatives represent potent inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway. We next asked whether rocaglamide derivatives specifically interfere with the NF-κB pathway or whether they affect the activity of other transcription factors, too. For this purpose we analyzed the influence of rocaglamides on AP-1 activity. AP-1 is a dimeric transcription factor, which regulates gene expression in response to a great variety of stimuli, including TNF and PMA (39Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells transiently transfected with an AP-1-dependent reporter gene (5xTRE-tk-luc) showed a strong basal activity already (in comparison to tk-luc). This activity was only marginally induced by TNF or PMA. We investigated the influence of rocaglamides on this basal AP-1 activity in Jurkat T cells. We found that AP-1 activity was not altered in the presence of active rocaglamide derivatives 1–5 and the previously inactive aglain derivative (compound 17). Interestingly, compound 8 strongly reduced reporter gene activity (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained when we investigated the PMA/ionomycin-induced activity of the Oct-coactivator BOB.1/OBF.1 (40Zwilling S. Dieckmann A. Pfisterer P. Angel P. Wirth T. Science. 1997; 277: 221-225Google Scholar, 41Pfisterer P. Annweiler A. Ullmer C. Corcoran L. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1654-1663Google Scholar). PMA/ionomycin-induced Oct-dependent activity was not inhibited by rocaglamides (data not shown), but again compound 8 showed a dramatic reduction of Oct-dependent activity. From this and several other experiments we concluded that the effects of compound 8 were unspecific. This rocaglamide derivative also showed strong cytotoxic effects (data not shown) and was therefore excluded from further experiments. In conclusion, rocaglamide derivatives are specific inhibitors of the NF-κB system and do not block the activity of the AP-1 and Oct transcription factors. We next tested the inhibition properties of rocaglamides in other cell lines to address the question whether the inhibition of the NF-κB-dependent gene expression might be due to a cell-type-specific mechanism. First we analyzed the A301 (human) and EL-4 (mouse) T-cell lines, which were transiently transfected with an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct. Similar to the results obtained with Jurkat T cells, the TNF (Fig.3 A) or PMA (Fig.3 B) stimulated activation of the NF-κB-driven reporter gene could be inhibited by RocB in EL-4 cells and in A301 cells (data not shown). The concentrations of RocB were in the same range as those needed for the inhibition of the NF-κB activation in Jurkat T cells. Again, the inactive compounds (the aglain derivative and 8β-methoxyrocaglaol) showed no inhibitory activity. Thus, we conclude that rocaglamides inhibit NF-κB induction in mouse and human T cell lines. Surprisingly, a remarkable resistance of several other cell lines toward inhibition of NF-κB by rocaglamide congeners was observed. In PC-12 cells bearing an integrated NF-κB-dependent reporter gene and transiently transfected human HeLa cells, rocaglamide derivatives were not able to block NF-κB activation. Even RocB concentrations up to 800 nm failed to inhibit NF-κB activation by PMA (Fig. 4 A) or TNF in PC-12 cells (data not shown). In HeLa cells several rocaglamides used at a concentration of 200 nm showed no inhibitory effect on TNF and PMA-induced NF-κB activity (Fig. 4, Band C). In contrast, when PC-12 and HeLa cells were treated with highly active rocaglamide derivatives, an increase of the NF-κB-dependent gene expression was found. The aglain derivative and 8β-methoxyrocaglaol showed no signs of inhibition or induction on the NF-κB system in these cells. Similar results were obtained in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and A549 human lung epithelial cells bearing an integrated NF-κB-dependent reporter gene (data not shown). We therefore conclude that rocaglamides do not block NF-κB in these non-T cells. All the cell lines that exhibited no rocaglamide-dependent inhibition of NF-κB were of non-lymphoid origin. We therefore asked whether B lymphocytes might respond to rocaglamides. For this purpose we used the variant plasmacytoma cell line S107, which lacks constitutive NF-κB activity typical for mature B cells but is still highly responsive to TNF (42Baumann B. Kistler B. Kirillov A. Bergman Y. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11448-11455Google Scholar). NF-κB-dependent gene expression was investigated using S107 cells with an integrated reporter gene. Although the required rocaglamide concentrations for inhibiting TNF-induced NF-κB activity in S107 cells were ∼5 to 7 times higher than in Jurkat T cells, inhibition could be observed (Fig. 4 D). Again, 8β-methoxyrocaglaol showed no inhibitory activity. From these results we conclude that NF-κB activation in lymphocytes, but not in several other cell types, is controlled by a rocaglamide-sensitive pathway. All of the NF-κB inhibitory effects of rocaglamides described here were observed in reporter gene assays. Therefore, we next investigated whether rocaglamides also influence the activation of endogenous NF-κB target genes. Jurkat T cells were pretreated with RocB, a highly active rocaglamide derivative and subsequently exposed to PMA. Total RNAs were then prepared and analyzed by RNase protection assay (RPA) analysis for the expression of known NF-κB target genes. To prove the NF-κB dependence of the respective genes, Jurkat cells deficient in IKKγ (43Harhaj E.W. Good L. Xiao G. Uhlik M. Cvijic M.E. Rivera-Walsh I. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1448-1456Google Scholar), the essential component of the NF-κB signaling pathway, were used in parallel for RNase protection assay analysis. These mutant Jurkat cells are unable to activate NF-κB in response to various NF-κB inducers, including PMA and TNF, but show normal activation of NF-AT and AP-1 (44Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Google Scholar). We found a strong up-regulation of LT-β (Fig. 5 A), Bfl1/A1 (Fig. 5 B), and TRAIL (Fig. 5 C), mRNA in Jurkat cells upon PMA treatment. At the same time PMA-induced expression of these genes was completely absent in IKKγ-deficient cells. This indicates a critical involvement of NF-κB transcription factors in the activation of these genes as described elsewhere (45Kuprash D.V. Osipovich O.A. Pokholok D.K. Alimzhanov M.B. Biragyn A.

https://openalex.org/W1969199435,"High affinity choline uptake plays a critical role in the regulation of acetylcholine synthesis in cholinergic neurons. Recently, we succeeded in molecular cloning of the high affinity choline transporter (CHT1), which is specifically expressed in cholinergic neurons. Here we demonstrate the presence of functionally relevant, nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in the human CHT1 gene by comprehensive sequence analysis of the exons and the intron/exon boundaries including the transcription start site. The deduced amino acid change for the polymorphism is isoleucine to valine at amino acid 89 (I89V) located within the third transmembrane domain of the protein. The allele frequency of I89V was 6% for Ashkenazi Jews. Functional assessment of the I89V transporter in mammalian cell lines revealed a 40–50% decrease in V max for choline uptake rate compared with the wild type, whereas there was no alteration in the apparent affinities for choline, sodium, chloride, and the specific inhibitor hemicholinum-3. There also was no change in the specific hemicholinum-3 binding activity. The decreased choline uptake was not associated with the surface expression level of the protein as assessed by biotinylation assay. These results suggest an impaired substrate translocation in the I89V transporter. The Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of CHT1 has a valine residue at the corresponding position and a single replacement from valine to isoleucine caused a decrease in the choline uptake rate by 40%, suggesting that this hydrophobic residue is generally critical in the choline transport rate in CHT1.

In the cholinergic neurons, choline is taken up into the presynaptic terminals by the Na+-dependent, high affinity choline transporter and subsequently used for acetylcholine (ACh) 1The abbreviations used are: ACh, acetylcholine; ChAT, choline acetyltransferase; hCHT1, human high affinity choline transporter 1; HC-3, hemicholinium-3; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UTR, untranslated region; WT, wild type; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends.1The abbreviations used are: ACh, acetylcholine; ChAT, choline acetyltransferase; hCHT1, human high affinity choline transporter 1; HC-3, hemicholinium-3; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UTR, untranslated region; WT, wild type; 5′-RACE, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends.synthesis catalyzed by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) (1Tucek S. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 11-24Google Scholar,2Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2227-2240Google Scholar). ACh is subsequently transported into synaptic vesicles by the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (2Eiden L.E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2227-2240Google Scholar, 3Parsons S.M. Prior C. Marshall I.G. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 35: 279-390Google Scholar). Choline uptake is thought be the rate-limiting step in ACh synthesis, because the rate of ACh synthesis correlates well with that of choline uptake (1Tucek S. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 11-24Google Scholar, 4Haga T. J. Neurochem. 1971; 18: 781-798Google Scholar, 5Yamamura H.I. Snyder S.H. Science. 1972; 178: 626-628Google Scholar, 6Haga T. Noda H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 291: 564-575Google Scholar, 7Kuhar M.J. Murrin L.C. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 15-21Google Scholar). ChAT is present in a kinetic excess and is not thought to be the rate-limiting factor for ACh synthesis (1Tucek S. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 11-24Google Scholar, 7Kuhar M.J. Murrin L.C. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 15-21Google Scholar). The high affinity choline uptake is acutely regulated by neuronal activity (7Kuhar M.J. Murrin L.C. J. Neurochem. 1978; 30: 15-21Google Scholar, 8Simon J.R. Kuhar M.G. Nature. 1975; 255: 162-163Google Scholar), and so it could be a unique marker for cholinergic neuronal activity as well as a marker of cholinergic neurons. The high affinity choline uptake is selectively inhibited by hemicholinium-3 (9Happe H.K. Murrin L.C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1191-1201Google Scholar).Recently, we succeeded in functional cloning of the high affinity choline transporter (CHT1) from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans using information provided by the C. elegansGenome Project (10Okuda T. Haga T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Ishihara T. Katsura I. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 120-125Google Scholar), and successively cloned the orthologs from rat (10Okuda T. Haga T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Ishihara T. Katsura I. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 120-125Google Scholar) and human (11Okuda T. Haga T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 92-97Google Scholar). CHT1 was found to belong to the Na+/solute symporter family (12Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 133-166Google Scholar) (TC 2.A.21 in Transport Protein data base) or the solute carrier family 5A (SLC5A in NCBI). The members of the family utilize the Na+ electrochemical gradient to drive the coupled transport of a variety of substrates (glucose, amino acids, osmolytes, myo-inositol, iodide, and vitamins). When expressed heterologously, CHT1 showed Na+- and Cl−-dependent high affinity choline uptake activity that is highly sensitive to hemicholinium-3 at nanomolar concentrations. CHT1 mRNA is expressed exclusively in cholinergic neurons. Very recent immunohistochemical studies revealed that the CHT1 protein was expressed specifically in cholinergic neurons including their terminals in the central nervous system of rat (13Misawa H. Nakata K. Matsuura J. Nagao M. Okuda T. Haga T. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 87-98Google Scholar, 14Lips K.S. Pfeil U. Haberberger R.V. Kummer W. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 307: 275-280Google Scholar) and primates (15Kobayashi Y. Okuda T. Fujioka Y. Matsumura G. Nishimura Y. Haga T. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 317: 25-28Google Scholar). Molecular identification of CHT1 enabled homology-based molecular cloning and characterization of CHT1 orthologs from various species including human (16Apparsundaram S. Ferguson S.M. George Jr., A.L. Blakely R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 862-867Google Scholar), Limulus (17Wang Y. Cao Z. Newkirk R.F. Ivy M.T. Townsel J.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 123-131Google Scholar), mouse (18Apparsundaram S. Ferguson S.M. Blakely R.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 711-716Google Scholar), andTorpedo (19Guermonprez L. O'Regan S. Meunier F.M. Morot Gaudry-Talarmain Y. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 874-884Google Scholar). These results indicate that CHT1 represents the high affinity choline transporter expressed specifically in cholinergic neurons from invertebrate to vertebrate.Cholinergic neurons are vital for motor, autonomic, and cognitive functions and are implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (20Francis P.T. Palmer A.M. Snape M. Wilcock G.K. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 1999; 66: 137-147Google Scholar, 21Isacson O. Seo H. Lin L. Albeck D. Granholm A.C. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 79-84Google Scholar), Down's syndrome (21Isacson O. Seo H. Lin L. Albeck D. Granholm A.C. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 79-84Google Scholar), Parkinson's disease (22Calabresi P. Centonze D. Gubellini P. Pisani A. Bernardi G. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 120-126Google Scholar), and schizophrenia (23Hyde T.M. Crook J.M. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2001; 22: 53-63Google Scholar). In Alzheimer's disease brain cholinergic deficits were recognized, as shown by decrease in ChAT activity with compensatory increases in the high affinity choline transporter (24Slotkin T.A. Nemeroff C.B. Bissette G. Seidler F.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 696-702Google Scholar,25Bissette G. Seidler F.J. Nemeroff C.B. Slotkin T.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 777: 197-204Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that mutation(s) or polymorphism(s) in CHT1 may act as associated factors or predisposing factors for these diseases or as modifiers of the disease phenotypes. The other members of the Na+/solute symporter family are known to be directly implicated in diseases: the Na+/glucose transporter (SGLT1) in glucose/galactose malabsorption (26Turk E. Zabel B. Mundlos S. Dyer J. Wright E.M. Nature. 1991; 350: 354-356Google Scholar, 27Wright E.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G879-G882Google Scholar) and the Na+/I−symporter (NIS) in congenital hypothyroidism (28Fujiwara H. Tatsumi K. Miki K. Harada T. Miyai K. Takai S. Amino N. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 124-125Google Scholar).We therefore screened for a polymorphism within the entire translated region of the human CHT1 gene in an Ashkenazi Jewish population and identified only one nonsynonymous polymorphism that predicts the amino acid substitution in the transporter protein. The substitution occurs in the putative third transmembrane region and was expected to affect the choline transport function. We analyzed the functional properties of the mutant transporter by expressing it in mammalian cell lines and demonstrate that the mutant transporter is functional, but exhibits altered choline transport rate.RESULTSTo identify the 5′-end of the human CHT1(hCHT1) gene, we determined the transcription start site of the hCHT1 gene by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) using human spinal cord mRNA and nested hCHT1gene-specific primers. Gel electrophoresis of RACE products showed a single band with a length of ∼300 bp, which was absent from the product from mRNA pretreated without tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, suggesting that this band was specifically amplified from the full-length, capped mRNA (Fig. 1). Sequence analysis of the ∼300-bp RACE product revealed that the known mRNA sequence (GenBankTM accession number AB043997) was elongated toward the 5′ end by 15 bp. The 5′-UTR of the hCHT1 mRNA is 291 bp in length (GenBankTM accession number AB084377). There is a TATA box in the proximal hCHT1 5′-flanking region located at position −30 relative to the transcription start site, and a putative Sp1 binding site at position −37.The entire hCHT1 gene is ∼25 kb in length with nine exons and eight introns. We comprehensively sequenced all the exons (except the region corresponding to 3′-UTR) and the intron/exon boundaries including the transcription start site of the hCHT1 gene from genomic DNA of 57 Ashkenazi Jews. Sequence analysis of the entire coding region as well as 5′-UTR revealed only one single nucleotide polymorphism. The nonsynonymous polymorphism consisted of an A to G transition at nucleotide 265 (A265G, Fig.2, A–D). The deduced amino acid change for this polymorphism is isoleucine to valine at amino acid 89 (I89V), located within the third transmembrane domain of the protein. Seven of the 57 chromosomes showed heterozygous alleles (A/G) and the allele frequency of this A265G was estimated to be 0.06.To assess the consequences of this polymorphism on transporter function, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with cDNA encoding either the wild-type (WT) or the I89V variant hCHT1 and measured [3H]choline uptake activity. Expression of I89V resulted in ∼40% reduction in choline uptake compared with WT (Fig.3 A). Kinetic analysis indicated that I89V showed ∼40% reduction inV max with no significant change in the apparent affinity for choline (Fig. 3 B and TableII). The K m value for choline was 2.8 ± 0.1 μm for WT and 3.0 ± 0.3 μm for I89V (n = 4). A similar difference in V max values was also observed for WT and I89V expressed in HEK293 cells (data not shown). [3H]HC-3 binding assays for WT and I89V revealed essentially the same dissociation constants (K d ∼6 nm) and binding capacities for HC-3 (Fig. 3 C and Table II). Consistent with this finding, the choline uptake was inhibited by HC-3 with essentially the same K i of ∼2 nmin both WT and I89V (Fig. 3 D). Because HC-3 is hydrophilic and impermeable to cell membrane, the HC-3 binding activity represents the expression level of the transporter in the plasma membrane. Thus, the same binding capacities for HC-3 indicate that the expression of hCHT1 in the plasma membrane is not significantly affected by the replacement of Ile by Val at amino acid 89. Overall, these results indicate that the I89V mutation in hCHT1 affects the choline uptake activity but not the apparent affinity for choline and HC-3 (TableII).Figure 3Functional properties of the WT and I89V CHT1 in transiently transfected COS7 cells. A, [3H]choline uptake of cells expressing WT and I89V. The choline uptake of cells expressing CHT1 was inhibited by 1 μm HC-3, but not in mock-transfected cells. Hence CHT1-mediated uptake was sensitive to 1 μm HC-3. The expression of WT resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in choline uptake over mock-transfected cells. B, specific choline uptake mediated by WT and I89V. Specific uptake was determined by subtracting uptake in the presence of 1 μm HC-3 from the total uptake.

Open table in a new tab Substitution of Li+ for Na+, or gluconate for Cl− resulted in almost full loss of choline uptake for either WT-transfected or I89V-transfected cells (data not shown). When Na+ was partly replaced by Li+, WT and I89V exhibited a similar dependence on Na+ concentration (Fig.4 A). hCHT1 showed a sigmoidal dependence on Na+ concentration, as described previously (11Okuda T. Haga T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 92-97Google Scholar). Na+ dependence for both WT and I89V did not become saturated in an isotonic substitution range, and so we could only estimate the K m value as >100 mm. When we replaced Cl− with gluconate, the Cl−dependence of hCHT1 was not affected by the I89V mutation. Cl− dependence of choline uptake could be fit to a single hyperbola for both WT and I89V, suggesting a stoichiometry of one Cl− per one choline molecule (Fig. 4 B). This coupling stoichiometry is in contrast to our previous result, in which NaCl was replaced by NaI and the choline uptake activity showed a sigmoidal dependence on Cl− concentration (11Okuda T. Haga T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 92-97Google Scholar). Iodide might have exerted an inhibitory effect on the uptake activity rather than acting as an inert anion, as observed in pantothenate uptake by Na+-dependent multivitamin transporter (30Wang H. Huang W. Fei Y.J. Xia H. Yang-Feng T.L. Leibach F.H. Devoe L.D. Ganapathy V. Prasad P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14875-14883Google Scholar). This 1 Cl−/1 choline coupling stoichiometry agrees with the result from high affinity choline uptake in brain synaptosomes, in which Cl− was replaced by acetate (31Kuhar M.J. Zarbin M.A. J. Neurochem. 1978; 31: 251-256Google Scholar). Cl−-dependent uptake by WT and I89V were saturated in the investigated substitution range. When fitting the Cl− dependence of choline uptake to the Hill equation, the apparent affinity for Cl− was 21 ± 2 mm(n = 3; nHill = 1.1 ± 0.1) for WT and 22 ± 3 mm (n = 3; nHill = 1.0 ± 0.1) for I89V (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Ionic dependence of the WT and I89V CHT1.

The staining patterns suggested that most of the proteins were retained in the cytoplasmic compartments and inefficiently targeted the plasma membrane. No staining was observed for mock-transfected cells (data not shown).Figure 5Surface expression of the WT and I89V CHT1. A, representative images from three independent experiments. Immunocytochemistry was performed on transfected COS-7 cells. Serial sections of 0.5 μm were obtained from COS-7 cells by confocal microscopy at ×63 magnification. B, immunoblot using CHT1-specific antibody shows biotinylated WT and I89V expressed in HEK293 cells. Note that biotinylated fractions were prepared from a 10-fold amount of total lysates loaded onto the gel, and subjected to Western analysis. Thus, the immunoreactivity in biotinylated fractions should be quantified as one-tenth of that in the corresponding total lysates. Nonbiotinylated fractions were prepared from an equal amount of total lysates after incubation with the streptavidin gel.C, immunoblot using anti-actin antibody. Actin was used as a marker for intracellular proteins. Lower levels of actin immunoreactive bands were detectable in the cell surface lanes, suggesting only minor contamination of biotinylated (cell surface) fractions with intracellular proteins. Actin immunoreactivity in the biotinylated fractions was <5% of that in the total lysate fractions, considering the fact that biotinylated fractions were prepared from a 10-fold amount of total lysates loaded onto the gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Direct immunoblots of WT- and I89V-transfected HEK293 cells showed no significant differences in expression levels of immunoreactive proteins (Fig. 5 B, Total). CHT1 reactive proteins in cells were detected as major bands of ∼45 and ∼80 kDa for both WT and I89V, whereas these bands were absent from mock-transfected cells (Fig.5 B). The predicted molecular weight from the hCHT1 primary structure is 63,162. The various bands may represent oligomers and/or heterogeneous glycosylation of hCHT1 protein. The unaltered expression level of the I89V protein in the plasma membrane, as suggested by the result from the HC-3 binding assay, was confirmed by selective labeling of the transporters at the cell surface using a membrane-impermeable biotin analog. Biotinylated proteins were separated from nonbiotinylated proteins by incubation with streptavidin gel, and both proteins were subjected to Western analysis. Biotinylated proteins were thought to be mostly expressed on the cell surface, because they were greatly, although not completely, depleted of the intracellular marker actin (Fig. 5 C). When CHT1 immunoreactivity in each biotinylated fraction was normalized with respect to the amount of actin immunoreactivity in total lysate fraction, no significant change was observed in I89V surface expression levels as compared with WT, supporting the result from the HC-3 binding assay that the expression levels of WT and I89V in the plasma membrane were not significantly different from each other.The I89V polymorphism occurs in the putative third transmembrane region of hCHT1. Alignment of the CHT1 amino acid sequence from various species shows that the putative transmembrane domain is highly conserved, and that residue 89 is occupied by hydrophobic amino acid residues such as Ile, Phe, or Val (Fig.6 A). To confirm whether this conservative residue plays a critical role in choline transporter function, we introduced several mutations at this position (Ile-89) in hCHT1. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, the substitution of Ala for Ile greatly reduced the choline uptake activity whereas the expression level in the plasma membrane was not greatly altered as assessed by the [3H]HC-3 binding activity and the apparent affinity for HC-3 was increased (K d, 2 nm for I89A versus 6 nm for WT). The substitution of Phe for Ile reduced both the choline uptake and the [3H]HC-3 binding activity. The C. elegansortholog of CHT1 (CHO-1) (10Okuda T. Haga T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Ishihara T. Katsura I. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 120-125Google Scholar) has a valine residue at the corresponding position (amino acid 90, Val-90) (Fig. 6 A). Accordingly, we next introduced isoleucine in place of valine at this position (V90I) in CHO-1. When expressed in HEK293 cells, the V90I transporter showed ∼40% decrease in choline uptake with unaltered affinity for choline and essentially the same [3H]HC-3 binding activity (Fig.6, D and E). These results indicate that this hydrophobic residue within the third transmembrane domain is, in general, critical in transport function of the high affinity choline transporter.Figure 6Functional properties of various mutants of CHT1 in transiently transfected COS-7 or HEK293 cells.

In this report, we describe the identification of nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism in the coding region of hCHT1 gene. Single nucleotide polymorphisms are increasingly recognized as a source of genetic variation, and their density may be as high as 1 per kb of cDNA (32Collins A. Lonjou C. Morton N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15173-15177Google Scholar). Most of these polymorphisms have a neutral effect on function, but some contribute to impaired protein function. Our analysis indicates that the I89V mutation does not affect the affinities for choline, Na+, Cl−, and HC-3. The unaffected potency of inhibitor as well as the unaffectedK m value for choline in I89V indicates that the mutation does not perturb the hCHT1 structure for ligand binding. In contrast, we found substantial functional differences between WT and I89V regarding the maximal transport capacity: theV max value was ∼40% lower for I89V than for WT. This V max reduction does not appear to be because of reduced translation of the protein or its reduced translocation to the cell surface, because the expression level of I89V in the plasma membrane was essentially the same as that of WT as assessed by both the HC-3 binding activity and the cell surface biotinylation experiments in the intact cells. Thus this reduction inV max means that the translocation rate for choline bound to the I89V transporter is ∼40% lower than that for choline bound to the WT transporter. The functional significance of the Ile-89 residue in hCHT1 and the corresponding Val-90 residue in the C. elegans CHO-1 was confirmed by mutation studies of these residues with other amino acid residues.The Ile-89 residue may be located either within the second or third transmembrane domain, depending on the topological model of CHT1, which is 12 or 13 transmembrane domains. We previously adopted the model with 12 transmembrane domains (10Okuda T. Haga T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Ishihara T. Katsura I. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 120-125Google Scholar, 11Okuda T. Haga T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 92-97Google Scholar), whereas other groups used a model with 13 transmembrane domains (16Apparsundaram S. Ferguson S.M. George Jr., A.L. Blakely R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 862-867Google Scholar, 17Wang Y. Cao Z. Newkirk R.F. Ivy M.T. Townsel J.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 123-131Google Scholar). Although conclusive evidence for the topology with 12 or 13 transmembrane domains is lacking at present, the following circumstantial evidence appears to favor the model with 13 transmembrane domains. CHT1 has homology with members of the Na+/solute symporter family, and a member of this family, the Na+/glucose transporter, was shown to have an extracellular N terminus and an intracellular C terminus, indicating the presence of 13 transmembrane domains (33Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Google Scholar). Upon the assumption that the family members have the same topological characteristics, these results imply that CHT1 also has 13 transmembrane domains, in which case the Ile-89 residue resides within the third transmembrane domain.The presence of functionally relevant polymorphic hCHT1 may account for interindividual variability in physiological responses where cholinergic neurons play a role. In addition, thehCHT1 polymorphism could be responsible for interindividual variability in disease predisposition or modification. Our findings suggest that at least some of the interindividual variation in the high affinity choline uptake activity could be explained by the genetic polymorphism at amino acid position 89 in the hCHT1 molecule. Under conditions in which choline uptake is the rate-limiting step in ACh synthesis, the lower activity of hCHT1 may significantly influence the functioning of cholinergic neurons in vivo. The I89V polymorphism may be particularly critical when there is a high demand for ACh under stimulated conditions, especially during continuous depolarization. Given that the cytoplasmic concentration of ACh in cholinergic nerve terminals of mammalian brain is estimated to be 0.2 to 1 mm (3Parsons S.M. Prior C. Marshall I.G. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1993; 35: 279-390Google Scholar) and that the vesicular acetylcholine transporter shows ACh uptake with a K m of ∼1 mm (34Varoqui H. Erickson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27229-27232Google Scholar), the rate of ACh uptake into synaptic vesicles may not be saturated in vivo. Indeed, overexpression of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter in Xenopus motor neurons results in an increase in the amplitude and frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents at the neuromuscular synapses (35Song H. Ming G. Fon E. Bellocchio E. Edwards R.H. Poo M. Neuron. 1997; 18: 815-826Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic concentration of ACh in nerve terminals may be critical for the vesicular storage and release of ACh in vivo. Recently, mutations in chAT have been shown to cause a congenital myasthenic syndrome associated with frequently fatal episodes of apnea in human (36Ohno K. Tsujino A. Brengman J.M. Harper C.M. Bajzer Z. Udd B. Beyring R. Robb S. Kirkham F.J. Engel A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2017-2022Google Scholar). In this disease, mutations impairing catalytic efficiencies of ChAT are associated with a stimulation-dependent decrease of the miniature end plate potential amplitude of the neuromuscular junction, suggesting that a defect in ACh synthesis has a significant impact on motor function. Considering the role of CHT1 in ACh synthesis, it is of interest to examine whether the hCHT1 polymorphism associated with impaired transport function in vitro has any consequencesin vivo.In conclusion, we report the identification and functional characterization of a single nucleotide polymorphism in thehCHT1 gene. We delineated the phenotypes of the polymorphism of hCHT1 with a substitution of Val for Ile in the third transmembrane domain. This naturally occurring mutation caused a si"

In this report we employed a novel quantitative assay system to assess the role of Hsp78 and Mcx1 in protein degradation within the matrix. Mitochondria were preloaded with large amounts of two purified recombinant reporter proteins exhibiting different folding stabilities. Proteolysis of the imported substrate proteins depended on the mitochondrial level of ATP and was mediated by the matrix protease Pim1/LON. Degradation rates were found to be independent of the folding stability of the reporter proteins. Mitochondria fromhsp78Δ cells exhibited a significant defect in the degradation efficiency of both substrates even at low temperature whereas mcx1Δ mitochondria showed wild-type activity. The proteolysis defect in hsp78Δ mitochondria was independent from the aggregation behavior of the substrate proteins. We conclude that Hsp78 is a genuine component of the mitochondrial proteolysis system required for the efficient degradation of substrate proteins in the matrix.

Members of this chaperone family were first described in Escherichia coli as ATP-dependent partner proteins of the serine-type protease ClpP. Apart from their function as cofactors of the protease, proteins of the Clp/Hsp100 family are involved in a variety of cellular activities due to their ability to influence changes in the folding and assembly state of proteins (3Gottesman S. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Cell. 1997; 91: 435-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Bacteria contain various subtypes of the Clp/Hsp100 chaperone proteins, whereas only three family members have been identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hsp104, which is located in the cytosol (4Sanchez Y. Lindquist S.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1112-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), and Hsp78, found in the mitochondrial matrix (5Leonhardt S.A. Fearson K. Danese P.N. Mason T.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6304-6313Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), are homologs of the bacterial ClpB and therefore belong to a subtype that shows no direct association with the ClpP protease (6Woo K.M. Kim K.I. Goldberg A.L. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20429-20434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ClpB has recently been shown to be involved in the reactivation of aggregated proteins in cooperation with the Hsp70 system in E. coli (7Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 8Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since a similar activity had previously been described for the cytosolic Hsp104 (10Parsell D.A. Kowal A.S. Singer M.A. Lindquist S. Nature. 1994; 372: 475-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 11Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar), the current view is that proteins of the ClpB subtype are mainly required for the protection of cellular protein function under severe stress conditions (7Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Roder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 12Sanchez Y. Taulien J. Borkovich K.A. Lindquist S.

Evidently, cellular proteins can be solubilized from heat-induced aggregates by ClpB-type chaperones and are released in a state that is recognized and stabilized by the Hsp70 system, which promotes further folding to the native conformation (8Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Zvi A.P. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13732-13737Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 11Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12388-12392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A similar role in thermotolerance and stress protection has been suggested for the mitochondrial homolog Hsp78 (15Schmitt M. Neupert W. Langer T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1375-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Moczko M. Schönfisch B. Voos W. Pfanner N. Rassow J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the absence of functional Hsp78, cells are viable but, under extreme heat stress,hsp78Δ mitochondria lose their respiratory function. Recent in vitro experiments suggested that Hsp78 can reactivate denatured polypeptides in an ATP-dependent reaction in cooperation with the mitochondrial Hsp70 system (17Krzewska J. Langer T. Liberek K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The third Clp/Hsp100 homolog in S. cerevisiae, Mcx1 (formitochondrial ClpX), is also localized in the mitochondrial matrix. Being related to the bacterial ClpX protein, it belongs to a different subtype of Clp/Hsp100 chaperones than Hsp78 (18Van Dyck L. Dembowski M. Neupert W. Langer T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In E. coli, ClpX forms a stable complex with ClpP and is thought to determine the substrate specificity of the protease (19Gottesman S. Clark W.P. de Crecy-Lagard V. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22618-22626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), acting as an ATP-dependent unfoldase that prepares substrates for degradation. Interestingly, in contrast to higher eukaryotes, there is no ClpP protease in yeast mitochondria, and the function of Mcx1 remains unclear. The involvement of Clp/Hsp100 proteins in degradative proteolytic reactions in bacteria suggests a similar role for the related proteins in eukaryotic organelles. However, the involvement of mitochondrial chaperone proteins as factors determining protein turnover are so far not well understood. Mitochondrial protein degradation requires ATP hydrolysis (20Black-Schaefer C.L. McCourt J.D. Poyton R.O. McKee E.E. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and is largely mediated by two proteolytic systems, the soluble ring-shaped Pim1/LON complex (for proteolysisin mitochondria), found in the matrix, and two inner membrane-bound AAA proteases, which mainly degrade proteins integrated into the mitochondrial inner membrane (21Langer T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Most identified substrates of Pim1 are soluble matrix proteins, yet some substrate overlap may exist with the membrane proteases (22Suzuki C.K. Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Grivell L.A. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 118-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 23Savel'ev A.S. Novikova L.A. Kovaleva I.E. Luzikov V.N. Neupert W. Langer T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20596-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Pim1 is not essential for cell survival but is required for the maintenance of an intact mitochondrial genome (24Van Dyck L. Pearce D.A. Sherman F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 238-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The induction of Pim1 expression upon heat stress may be indicative of a role in the degradation of denatured and misfolded proteins. Efficient degradation of misfolded proteins by Pim1 required a functional cooperation with the mitochondrial Hsp70, Ssc1, and its co-chaperone Mdj1, which hold aggregation-prone polypeptides in a soluble form (25Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5135-5145Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in addition to their proteolytic activities, chaperone properties have been attributed to Pim1 as well as to the components of the membrane-bound proteases (22Suzuki C.K. Rep M. van Dijl J.M. Suda K. Grivell L.A. Schatz G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 118-123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 26Arlt H. Tauer R. Feldmann H. Neupert W. Langer T. Cell. 1996; 85: 875-885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), which suggests that chaperone-like recognition of non-native polypeptides could be a prerequisite for efficient protein degradation. For this report we employed a novel assay system with imported recombinant substrate proteins to study protein degradation in the mitochondrial matrix, as well as the involvement of Clp/Hsp100 chaperones in this process. In contrast to previous mitochondrial degradation assays using radiolabeled preproteins in small amounts, we challenged the proteolytic system with large amounts of substrate proteins (27Lim J.H. Martin F. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), an assay system that allowed us to determine the kinetics of the degradation reaction. Two reporter proteins with different folding stabilities were accumulated in the mitochondrial matrix to compare the energy requirement of their degradation and to examine the involvement of the chaperones Hsp78 and Mcx1 in the process. We found that the folding state of the substrates did not affect the ATP requirement of the Pim1-mediated degradation reaction. Surprisingly, the mitochondrial Hsp100 chaperone Hsp78 was required for efficient degradation of imported substrate, whereas the second mitochondrial Hsp100 family member, Mcx1, did not influence the efficiency of protein degradation. Because proteins of the ClpB family have mainly been implicated in the reactivation of aggregated polypeptides, the involvement of Hsp78 in proteolysis represents a new functional aspect of this chaperone class. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are summarized in Table I. To generate isogenic Clp/Hsp100 mutant strains, strains SAL3 (hsp78Δ) (16Moczko M. Schönfisch B. Voos W. Pfanner N. Rassow J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) andmcx1Δ (EUROSCARF) were crossed using standard methods of yeast genetics. By tetrad dissection, the single mutants, WVY40 (hsp78Δ) and WVY39 (mcx1Δ), as well as the corresponding wild-type, WVY38 (WT), were isolated. The complete open reading frame of PIM1 was disrupted in the wild-type strain YPH499 (28Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by transforming the HIS3 marker from plasmid pFA6-HIS3MX6 (29Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C. Rebischung C. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1065-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), which was amplified using oligonucleotides complementary to 100 bp upstream and downstream of the PIM1open reading frame, resulting in the rho −strain KRY02 (pim1Δ). To create the correspondingrho − wild-type strain to KRY02 (pim1Δ), strain YPH499 was exposed to ethidium bromide (30Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar), resulting in KRY01 (WT in Fig. 3). Mitochondria were isolated from these strains according to published procedures (31Ryan M.T. Voos W. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 189-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from yeast cultures grown at 30 °C in YP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone) containing 3% glycerol, or 2% glucose in the case of respiration-deficient cells.Table ISaccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this studyStrainsGenotypeSourceWVY38his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63This studyWVY39his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ11 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 mcx1Δ∷kanMXThis studyWVY40his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 hsp78Δ∷URA3This studyKRY01MATα ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 lys2–801 rho−This studyKRY02MATα ade2–101 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 ura3–52 trp1-Δ63 lys2–801 pim1Δ∷HIS3 rho−This study Open table in a new tab Recombinant cytochromeb2-DHFR 1The abbreviations used for: DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; PK, proteinase K. preproteins were expressed in E. coli BMH71-18 cells from plasmid pUHE5377 (b2 (167)Δ-DHFR) (32Dekker P.J. Martin F. Maarse A.C. Bömer U. Müller H. Guiard B. Meijer M. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5408-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) under the control of an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-inducible promoter. For the construct b2-DHFRds, three point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, which led to amino acid changes in three positions (C7S, S42C, and N49C) (33Vestweber D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Preproteins were purified from inclusion bodies by several extractions with increasing urea concentrations according to a protocol modified from Schmidet al. (34Schmid B. Kromer M. Schulz G.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For the in vitro import reactions, saturating amounts of preproteins denatured in urea buffer (7 M urea, 30 mm MOPS (3-(N-morpholino)propane sulfonic acid) pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol) were incubated with isolated mitochondria as previously published (27Lim J.H. Martin F. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 250 pmol of preprotein per mg of mitochondrial protein. Unless stated otherwise, the reporter proteins were detected after SDS-PAGE and Western blotting by immunodecoration with an affinity-purified antiserum raised against mouse DHFR. DHFR signals were detected with the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using Image Master 1D software (Amersham Biosciences) and EXCEL 98 (Microsoft). After import of b2-DHFR or b2-DHFRds for 15 min at 25 °C, mitochondria were reisolated for 2 min in the presence of 50 μg/ml ice-cold trypsin to remove excess preprotein. The trypsin-containing supernatant was removed completely. 25 μg of mitochondria were lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.3% Triton X-100, 30 mm Tris pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl) containing 100 μg/ml proteinase K (PK). After incubation on ice for 5 min, PK was inactivated by addition of 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and analyzed as described. Recombinant b2-DHFR preproteins were imported into 150 μg of isolated mitochondria for 15 min at 25 °C as described. Subsequently 1/10 of the reaction mix was taken as an import sample. A second import sample corresponding to 1/10 of the original mix was taken after PK treatment (100 μg/ml) for 10 min on ice. After reisolation, mitochondria were resuspended in 800 μl of pre-warmed import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2) supplied with 4 mm NADH, and either 10 units/ml apyrase and 0.1 mm oligomycin, or an ATP-regenerating system (3 mm ATP, 20 mmcreatine phosphate, 200 μg/ml creatine kinase), and incubated at 25 °C or 37 °C. At time points 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min, 100-μl aliquots were taken, mitochondria were reisolated, and the amount of remaining reporter protein was determined as described. Following import of b2-DHFR at 25 °C, mitochondria were reisolated and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C or 37 °C in fresh import buffer containing ATP. 30 μg of mitochondria were treated with 100 μg/ml PK for 10 min on ice, and samples were split into an import control and a sample for the aggregation assay. After reisolation and washing with SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mmMOPS-KOH pH 7.2), mitochondria were lysed on ice in 200 μl lysis buffer (0.3% Triton X-100, 30 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 mm ATP, 5 mm MgCl2) and shaken for 5 min at 4 °C. Lysed import controls were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Samples for the aggregation assay were subjected to a high-speed centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, the insoluble fraction was re-extracted with lysis buffer and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 30 min. All samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunodetection of DHFR as described. To determine the factors that influence protein degradation rates in the mitochondrial matrix, we surveyed the turnover of two types of reporter proteins. Both were composed of the amino-terminal part of the precursor form ofS. cerevisiae cytochrome b2, providing the mitochondrial targeting signal, fused to the entire mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) (Fig.1 A). By a deletion of 19 amino acids in the presequence of cytochromeb2, the intermembrane space sorting signal was disabled and the fusion proteins were directly imported into the matrix compartment (35Koll H. Guiard B. Rassow J. Ostermann J. Horwich A.L. Neupert W. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1992; 68: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 36Beasley E.M. Müller S. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2303-2311Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To analyze how the conformational stability of substrate proteins influenced the degradation reaction, we used a construct that contained a wild-type DHFR domain (b2-DHFR), and a second construct with a DHFR domain carrying three amino acid substitutions (b2-DHFRds) that prevent folding to a stable conformation (33Vestweber D. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The precursor proteins were expressed and purified as recombinant proteins from E. coli cells and imported in vitrointo isolated mitochondria from S. cerevisiae (27Lim J.H. Martin F. Guiard B. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To obtain maximal import efficiency, the recombinant precursor proteins were denatured in buffer containing urea before the import reaction. The imported reporter proteins were detected by Western blot and immunodecoration with an antibody directed against the DHFR moiety. Import into wild-type mitochondria was efficient and specific as shown by the processing to the mature form and the dependence on a mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2, upper and lower panels). The processed forms were protected from externally added proteases, confirming their mitochondrial localization (Fig. 1 B,lane 7, upper and lower panels). Efficient import of both reporter proteins was also observed in mitochondria isolated from strains lacking the mitochondrial Clp/Hsp100 family members Hsp78 or Mcx1 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–6and 9–12, upper and lower panels). Using the very efficient in vitro import system with recombinant preproteins, we were able to accumulate large amounts of potential substrate proteins in the mitochondrial matrix. By comparison with standardized Western blots, we estimated that 50–80 pmol of the b2-DHFR reporter proteins per mg of mitochondria were imported. Therefore, the proteolytic machinery in the matrix was challenged with large amounts of substrate proteins in the assay system. We first tested whether the mitochondrial chaperone system was able to fold the accumulated proteins to a stable conformation. We analyzed the folding state of the DHFR domains of b2-DHFR and b2-DHFRds by a treatment with proteinase K after lysis of mitochondria under native conditions. Folded DHFR is highly protease-resistant, and degradation only occurs slowly upon spontaneous unfolding (37Von Ahsen O. Lim J.H. Caspers P. Martin F. Schönfeld H.J. Rassow J. Pfanner N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 809-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After the protease treatment of the imported b2-DHFR, a protease-resistant fragment of ∼20 kDa was recognized by the DHFR antibody that corresponds in size to the DHFR domain (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). When the import reaction was blocked in the absence of a membrane potential, no signal was detected, demonstrating that the folded DHFR fragment was generated from the imported protein (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and 6). The DHFR domain of the imported recombinant preproteins was therefore able to reach its native folding state. In contrast, the construct b2-DHFRds with its destabilized DHFR domain was completely degraded under the same conditions (Fig. 1 C, lane 5), indicating that it did not acquire a protease-resistant conformation. Using the in vitro import assay, mitochondria were preloaded with substrates for the degradation machinery. After the import reaction was stopped and excess preprotein was removed by a protease treatment, the fate of the reporter proteins in the matrix was followed during an incubation at 25 °C over the course of 4 h (Fig. 2 A). Although the imported b2-DHFR was folded to the native conformation, it was degraded with high efficiency (Fig. 2 B,upper panel). The degradation kinetics of the destabilized b2-DHFRds proved to be very similar to the folded b2-DHFR, suggesting that the degradation rate is independent of the folding state of the substrate (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). After 60 to 90 min, most of the respective imported proteins were degraded. Further degradation occurred until the maximum incubation time, albeit with lower rates. In this assay we typically did not observe the generation of specific fragments of lower molecular weight, indicating that the substrate proteins were degraded to small fragments that could not be recognized by the DHFR antibody used for detection. As a control, we also analyzed the levels of endogenous proteins of various mitochondrial subcompartments. In contrast to the imported foreign reporter proteins, the levels of the soluble matrix protein Mge1 as well as the inner membrane-associated proteins Tim44 and F1β did not show alterations during the full incubation period (Fig. 2 C). The amount of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom40 was similarly unchanged or only slightly reduced, possibly due to the treatment with external proteases after import. The stability of the endogenous control proteins indicated that the mitochondria stayed intact during the assay. We conclude that the large amounts of the imported b2-DHFR and b2-DHFRds were degraded efficiently, independent of their folding states. The degradation of the recombinant reporter proteins seemed to be a selective process since other proteins in the matrix remained stable. Both chaperone function and proteolytic reactions have been shown to depend on ATP hydrolysis. Here we tested whether the proteolysis of the imported recombinant substrate proteins depended on the level of ATP in the mitochondrial matrix and which protease was responsible for the observed degradation. The major ATP-dependent protease of the mitochondrial matrix is the Pim1/LON protease. We constructed a pim1Δ yeast strain that did not contain the Pim1/LON protease. Because the mutant yeast cells had a defect in mitochondrial respiration, a comparable respiration-deficient wild-type strain was generated. When we specifically depleted the ATP levels in the matrix of mitochondria derived from this wild-type strain, we found that the imported b2 -DHFR construct remained stable over the course of 240 min (Fig. 3 A,upper panel). In the presence of excess ATP, supplied by an ATP-regenerating system, degradation was fast and efficient, as shown by the decreasing amount of b2 -DHFR (Fig.3 A, lower panel). In all cases, similar degradation efficiencies between respiring and non-respiring mitochondrial preparations were observed, indicating that the respiration competence has no major influence on mitochondrial proteolysis. In addition, no difference was observed between b2-DHFR and b2-DHFRds in the ATP dependence of the degradation (data not shown), confirming the conclusion that the folding state of substrate proteins was not a major determinant of the degradation rate. The ATP dependence of the reaction, in addition to the observed stability of endogenous matrix proteins exclude that the reduction of the DHFR signals in the degradation assay was caused by an unspecific process. To determine whether Pim1 was responsible for the observed degradation of the b2 -DHFR preproteins, we imported large amounts of recombinant b2 -DHFR precursors into the matrix space of pim1Δ mitochondria. In the absence of ATP, no degradation occurred over the course of 240 min in mitochondria lacking Pim1 (Fig. 3 B, upper panel), as observed before in wild-type organelles. Under conditions of excess ATP, the imported b2 -DHFR remained equally stable over the full incubation period (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). The same result was observed for the destabilized construct b2-DHFRds, which remained stable in the absence of ATP as well as in energized Pim1-deficient mitochondria (data not shown). This demonstrates that both recombinant model proteins were hydrolyzed by Pim1 in an ATP-dependent reaction. By the complete lack of degradation in pim1Δ mitochondria, we can exclude that other proteolytic activities were involved in this process. Because mitochondria contain homologs of the bacterial Clp/Hsp100 proteins that have been shown to participate in various proteolytic reactions, we analyzed their involvement in the Pim1-mediated degradation of imported b2-DHFR reporter proteins. The bacterial ClpX protein can function as a subunit of the ClpP protease, assisting in substrate binding and preparation for degradation, but no direct function has been established for the mitochondrial ClpX homolog Mcx1 so far. Hence, we analyzed a possible involvement of Mcx1 in mitochondrial proteolysis by performing degradation assays in a deletion mutant lacking Mcx1. We found that both precursor proteins were efficiently degraded in mcx1Δ mitochondria with the same rates as in wild-type mitochondria (Fig.4); thus, the ClpX homolog Mcx1 does not appear to be involved in the turnover of matrix-localized proteins. The main function described to date of the mitochondrial ClpB homolog Hsp78 is the involvement in the maintenance of mitochondrial thermotolerance. Here we employed the degradation assay with recombinant imported preproteins to test whether Hsp78 was also involved in mitochondrial proteolysis. In the wild-type control, b2 -DHFR was degraded efficiently while mitochondria isolated from cells lacking Hsp78 showed a pronounced defect in degradation (Fig.5 A, left diagram). Although the reporter protein was still degraded in the absence of Hsp78, the overall degradation efficiency was significantly reduced compared with that of the wild-type mitochondria. Up to 80% of the initially present reporter proteins were degraded in wild-type mitochondria after 4 h of incubation whereas inhsp78Δ mitochondria only about 40% were degraded. Interestingly, only minor effects of the hsp78Δ mutation on the initial rate of degradation were observed. We also tested whether the proteolytic breakdown of the destabilized construct b2-DHFRds depended on Hsp78 (Fig.5 A, right diagram). The kinetics of the degradation reaction of the folding-deficient b2-DHFRds in the wild-type were generally similar to the folded b2 -DHFR but showed a higher rate in the first part of the incubation period. Inhsp78Δ mitochondria, we again observed a strongly reduced degradation efficiency (Fig. 5 A, right diagram). Only at very long incubation times was the proteolysis of the destabilized b2-DHFRdsaccelerating again in hsp78Δ mitochondria, an effect that was not observed with the folded reporter protein. In summary, Hsp78 was required for the efficient degradation of both DHFR folding variants, indicating that the chaperone was involved in the degradation process irrespective of the folding state of the substrate. Because the function of Hsp78 has been shown to be particularly important at elevated temperatures, we also surveyed proteolysis of the b2-DHFR reporter proteins at 37 °C. The proteolytic breakdown of b2-DHFR i"
https://openalex.org/W2089239796,"Previous studies indicated that calcitonin (CT), a peptide hormone involved in calcium homeostasis, is transiently expressed in the receptive rat and human endometrial epithelia within the window of implantation. Attenuation of uterine CT expression using antisense methods severely impaired implantation in the rat. The molecular pathway of CT in the pregnant uterus, however, remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the cellular events following the binding of CT to its membrane receptors in human endometrial epithelial cell line Ishikawa. We observed that CT treatment triggers a transient rise in intracellular calcium in these cells. Most interestingly, CT treatment also led to the disappearance of E-cadherin, a critical cell adhesion molecule, from cell-cell contact sites. Blockade of intracellular calcium release by BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl) prevented the CT-induced disappearance of E-cadherin. Our studies further revealed that CT treatment markedly down-regulates the level of E-cadherin mRNA in Ishikawa cells. We also examined whether CT influences the expression of E-cadherin mRNA in intact rat uterine tissue during implantation. In pregnant rats, high levels of E-cadherin mRNA were expressed during the first 3 days of gestation when the CT mRNA in uterine epithelial cells is undetectable. Concomitant with a transient burst of CT expression during days 4–5 of pregnancy, the level of E-cadherin mRNA declined sharply. Furthermore, administration of exogenous CT to animals on day 2 of pregnancy led to a premature suppression of E-cadherin mRNA level on day 3, indicating a direct link between elevated levels of uterine CT and the down-regulation of E-cadherin expression in the surface epithelium. Collectively, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that CT-induced reduction in E-cadherin expression may remodel the adherens junctions between epithelial cells, and this change in epithelial cell phenotype might be a critical event during the implantation of the blastocyst. Previous studies indicated that calcitonin (CT), a peptide hormone involved in calcium homeostasis, is transiently expressed in the receptive rat and human endometrial epithelia within the window of implantation. Attenuation of uterine CT expression using antisense methods severely impaired implantation in the rat. The molecular pathway of CT in the pregnant uterus, however, remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the cellular events following the binding of CT to its membrane receptors in human endometrial epithelial cell line Ishikawa. We observed that CT treatment triggers a transient rise in intracellular calcium in these cells. Most interestingly, CT treatment also led to the disappearance of E-cadherin, a critical cell adhesion molecule, from cell-cell contact sites. Blockade of intracellular calcium release by BAPTA-AM (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl) prevented the CT-induced disappearance of E-cadherin. Our studies further revealed that CT treatment markedly down-regulates the level of E-cadherin mRNA in Ishikawa cells. We also examined whether CT influences the expression of E-cadherin mRNA in intact rat uterine tissue during implantation. In pregnant rats, high levels of E-cadherin mRNA were expressed during the first 3 days of gestation when the CT mRNA in uterine epithelial cells is undetectable. Concomitant with a transient burst of CT expression during days 4–5 of pregnancy, the level of E-cadherin mRNA declined sharply. Furthermore, administration of exogenous CT to animals on day 2 of pregnancy led to a premature suppression of E-cadherin mRNA level on day 3, indicating a direct link between elevated levels of uterine CT and the down-regulation of E-cadherin expression in the surface epithelium. Collectively, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that CT-induced reduction in E-cadherin expression may remodel the adherens junctions between epithelial cells, and this change in epithelial cell phenotype might be a critical event during the implantation of the blastocyst. Implantation involves complex and progressively intimate interactions between the blastocyst and the uterine epithelium (1Psychoyos A. Greep R.O. Astwood E.G. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Washington, D. C.1973: 187-215Google Scholar, 2Carson D.D. Bagchi I. Dey S.K. Enders A.C. Fazleabas A.T. Lessey B.A. Yoshinaga K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In humans and rodents, the blastocyst initially adheres to and penetrates the uterine epithelium and subsequently invades the uterine stroma (1Psychoyos A. Greep R.O. Astwood E.G.

Biol. 2000; 223: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). At the initial stages of implantation, the uterine epithelium undergoes pronounced changes in cell proliferation and remodeling, which prepares it to be “receptive” to invasion by the embryo (1Psychoyos A. Greep R.O. Astwood E.G. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiological Society, Washington, D. C.1973: 187-215Google Scholar, 2Carson D.D. Bagchi I. Dey S.K. Enders A.C. Fazleabas A.T.

The specific modifications leading to the acquisition of the receptive state of the uterine epithelium are regulated by a complex interplay of a variety of effectors including steroid hormones, growth factors, and cytokines (2Carson D.D. Bagchi I. Dey S.K. Enders A.C. Fazleabas A.T. Lessey B.A. Yoshinaga K. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 7Psychoyos A.J. Reprod. Fertil.

However, the precise nature of the molecular mechanisms through which these effectors promote uterine receptivity remains unclear. Our previous studies identified calcitonin (CT), 1The abbreviations used for: CT, calcitonin; BAPTA-AM 1, 2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester; CGRP, calcitonin gene-related peptide; CTR(s), calcitonin receptor(s); DIG, digoxigenin; fluo-3 AM, fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RT, reverse transcription; sCT, salmon calcitonin; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide. a peptide hormone known to regulate calcium homeostasis in bone and kidney cells, as a potential regulator of implantation (10Ding Y.Q.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3923-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The expression of CT was transiently induced in rat endometrium epithelium precisely at the onset of implantation (10Ding Y.Q. Zhu L.J. Bagchi M.K. Bagchi I.C. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2265-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 11Zhu L.-Z. Cullinan-Bove K. Polihronis M. Bagchi M.K. Bagchi I.C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3923-3934Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our studies also showed that the expression of CT is induced in the human endometrial epithelium specifically during the mid-secretory phase (days 19–24) of the menstrual cycle, which closely overlaps with the putative window of implantation (12Kumar S. Zhu L.Z. Polihronis M. Cameron S.T. Baird D.T. Schatz F. Dua A. Ying Y.K. Bagchi M.K. Bagchi I.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 83: 4443-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Most importantly, suppression of the steady-state level of the CT mRNAs in the preimplantation rat uterus by antisense ODNs resulted in a dramatic reduction in the number of implanted embryos (13Zhu L.J. Bagchi M.K. Bagchi I.C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 330-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested strongly that a transient surge of CT expression in the preimplantation rat uterus is crucial for blastocyst implantation. The precise function of CT in rat and human endometrium during implantation, however, remains unknown. To gain an understanding of the function of CT during implantation, we investigated the regulation of cellular functions by this hormone in a human endometrial epithelial cell line Ishikawa. We observed that binding of CT to its cell surface receptor in Ishikawa cells leads to a transient rise in intracellular calcium, which in turn suppresses the expression of calcium-dependent cell adhesion glycoprotein, E-cadherin, at cell-cell contact sites. Consistent with this in vitro observation, we found that administration of exogenous CT down-regulates E-cadherin expression in the endometrial epithelium of pregnant rats without altering the expression of ZO-1, a marker of tight junctions. Based on these results, we favor the hypothesis that uterine CT plays a critical role during implantation by modulating adherens junctions. We postulate that the hormone-induced down-regulation of E-cadherin expression results in the reorganization of the adherens junctions between epithelial cells, thereby facilitating implantation of the blastocyst. Salmon CT (sCT), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and CGRP antagonist 8-37 were purchased from Peninsula Laboratories (Belmont, CA). Antibodies against E-cadherin (human) and ZO-1 (rat) were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA). An antibody against E-cadherin (rat) was purchased from BD Transduction Company (Lexington, KY). All experiments involving animals were conducted according to NIH standards for the care and use of experimental animals. Virgin female rats (Sprague-Dawley, from Charles River, Wilmington, MA; 60–75 days of age), in proestrus, were mated with adult males. The different stages of the cycle in the nonpregnant rats were ascertained by examining vaginal smears. The presence of a vaginal plug after mating was designated as day 1 of pregnancy. The animals were killed at various stages of gestation and the uteri collected. In some experiments, animals were injected intravenously or intramuscularly with 100 μg of sCT as described under “Results.” The rats were killed 24 h after the final injection. Previous studies have shown that T47D cells harbor abundant CT receptors. Two forms of human CT receptors have been cloned from expression cDNA library generated from these cells (14Kuestner R.E. Elrod R.D. Grant F.J. Hagen F.S. Kuijper J.L. Matthewes S.L. O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Stroop S.D. Thompson D.L. Whitmore T.E. Findlay D.M. Houssami S. Sexton P.M. Moore E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 246-255PubMed Google Scholar). We have therefore used T47D as control cells. Ishikawa and T47D cells were grown in calcium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum. 0.5 ml of culture medium containing Ishikawa or T47D cells was placed in test tubes. Each tube received 50,000 cpm of125I-sCT (Peninsula Laboratories). Unlabeled sCT was added to the tubes to produce a cold displacement curve. The tubes were incubated overnight with gentle agitation at 4 °C, washed twice with 2 ml of culture medium, and counted in a γ-counter. The results were subjected to Scatchard analysis to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and number of binding sites/cell. Intracellular calcium was monitored in Ishikawa cells by fluorescence microscopy. 1,000 Ishikawa cells/well were cultured in 96-well plates overnight and loaded with 10 μm fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (fluo-3 AM) at 37 °C for 1 h. The attached cells were rinsed three times with medium and cultured in 100 μl of fresh medium. Some of the cells were preloaded for 1 h with 10 μm BAPTA-AM in addition to fluo-3 AM. Fluorescent images were generated by excitation of fluo-3 at 450–490 nm with a mercury lamp and detecting the light emitted at 525 nm. A GenIISys image intensifier (DAGE-MTI, Inc., Michigan City, IN) was used to enhance the signal. All images were video-taped every 5 s using a Panasonic AG-7350 video recorder. The video camera (CCD 72, DAGE-MTI, Inc.) was set to reverse the image so that a computer-based image analysis system (MCID M4, Image Research, St. Catherine's, Ontario, Canada) could be utilized to determine the fluorescence intensity. [Ca2+]i was estimated using Equation 1, [Ca2+]i=Kd(F−Fmin)/(Fmax−F)Equation 1 where Kd is the dissociation constant for [Ca2+]i (316 nm),F is the fluorescence intensity, F minis the background fluorescence, and F max is the maximal fluorescence obtained by equilibrating cytoplasmic and extracellular Ca2+ using 5 μm ionomycin. 10 cells in each well were monitored to determine the average fluorescence intensity for calculation of [Ca2+]i. Ishikawa cells were grown in calcium-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to 60–70% confluence. Cells were then treated with either 10 nm/100 nm CT or vehicle. 24 h after treatment with CT, cell surface distribution of E-cadherin was examined by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes E-cadherin. For certain experiments cells were also treated with 100 nmCGRP or CGRP antagonist 8-37 for 24 h. In other experiments, cells were pretreated with 33.3 μm BAPTA-AM for 1 h before the addition of CT. The experiments were repeated at least three times. For Northern analysis 20 μg of total RNA was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to Duralon membrane (Stratagene). After transfer, the membranes were baked at 80 °C for 2 h. Blots were prehybridized in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 6.5, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 4 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out overnight in the same buffer containing 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled E-cadherin cDNA fragment. The filters were washed twice for 15 min in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, then twice for 20 min in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 55 °C, and the filters were exposed to x-ray films for 24–72 h. The intensities of signals on the autoradiogram were estimated by densitometric scanning. To correct for RNA loading, the obtained signals were normalized with respect to the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) signal in the same blot. For this the filters were stripped of the radioactive probe by washing for 10 min in 0.5% SDS at 95 °C. The blots were then reprobed with a32P-labeled GAPDH probe as described above. Uterine tissues from pregnant animals were collected and frozen. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cryostat sections were cut at 8 μm and attached to 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (Sigma)-coated slides. In situhybridization was performed with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled sense or antisense RNA probes complementary to E-cadherin gene. DIG-labeled RNA probes were synthesized from E-cadherin cDNA using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and DIG-labeled nucleotides according to manufacturer's specifications (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prehybridization was carried out in a damp chamber at 37 °C for 60 min in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine). Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight in a damp humidified chamber. To develop the substrate, sections were washed sequentially in 2× SSC, 1× SSC, and 0.1× SSC for 15 min in each buffer at 37 °C. Sections were then incubated with anti-DIG alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody. Excess antibody was washed away, and the color substrate nitro blue tetrazolium salt and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate was added. Slides were allowed to develop in the dark, and the color was visualized under light microscopy until maximum levels of staining were achieved. The reaction was stopped, and the slides were counterstained in Nuclear Fast Red for 5 min. The slides were washed in water, dehydrated, and coverslipped. Control incubations utilized a DIG-labeled RNA sense strand and were performed under identical conditions. Polyclonal antibodies against rat E-cadherin and ZO-1 were diluted 1:1,000 for immunohistochemistry. Frozen uteri were sectioned at 7 μm, mounted on slides, and then fixed in 5% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min and then incubated in a blocking solution containing 10% normal rabbit serum for 10 min before incubation in primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunostaining was performed using a streptavidin-biotin kit for rabbit primary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Red deposits indicate the sites of immunostaining. Total RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using a Stratascript kit. Briefly, the RNA samples were mixed with oligo(dT) primer, incubated at 65 °C for 5 min, and annealed at room temperature. First strand cDNA was synthesized using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase at 37 °C, and the reaction was stopped by heating the tubes at 95 °C for 5 min. PCR was then performed in a 100-μl total volume using 35 ng of CT; E-cadherin; and GAPDH-specific primers; 200 μm each dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP; 1.5 mm Mg2+; and 0.5 μl of Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The conditions for PCR were: 94 °C for 30 s for 1 cycle followed by 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min for 25 cycles. PCR products were electrophoresed on agarose gels and processed for Southern blot analysis. Total RNA was prepared from Ishikawa cells as well as from T47D breast cancer cells. The T47D cells are known to express abundant CTRs and served as a positive control (14Kuestner R.E. Elrod R.D. Grant F.J. Hagen F.S. Kuijper J.L. Matthewes S.L. O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Stroop S.D. Thompson D.L. Whitmore T.E. Findlay D.M. Houssami S. Sexton P.M. Moore E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 246-255PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA samples were reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR using CTR-specific primers that flank the region of the insert containing 16 amino acids. The PCR products were then subjected to Southern blot analysis employing a radiolabeled CTR cDNA fragment as a probe. PCR products (2 μl each) were run on 1% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to Duralon membrane (Stratagene). The membrane was prehybridized in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA for 2 h at 68 °C. Hybridization was performed in the same buffer containing 106 cpm/ml 32P-labeled cDNA fragments of CT, E-cadherin, and GAPDH overnight at 68 °C. The membrane was washed with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature, in 0.1× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 68 °C for 45 min and exposed to x-ray film for 8 h. Uteri were collected from rats on days 1, 4, and 6 of pregnancy, homogenized, and extracted in chilled buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm KCl, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.015 mm pepstatin A, 0.085 mm bestatin, and 0.011 mm E-64 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The extract was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded (50–80 μg of total protein in each lane) onto a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, which was transferred to a solution of 5% dried nonfat milk in TBS (0.1m Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5) and incubated overnight with primary antibody (rabbit anti-E-cadherin polyclonal antibody or rabbit anti-ZO-1 polyclonal antibody). After washes, the membrane was probed with secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase, washed extensively before incubation in enhanced chemiluminescence reagent, and exposed to autoradiographic film. Pregnant rats were treated with sense and antisense ODNs targeted to CT mRNA as described previously (13Zhu L.J. Bagchi M.K. Bagchi I.C. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 330-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized, and an incision was made in the lower abdomen. The sense or antisense ODNs were mixed with DOTAP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 20% F127 pluronic gel (Sigma). The solution was maintained in liquid form at 4 °C before injection. 20 μg of this ODN solution was taken in prechilled syringes and injected into each uterine horn on day 2 of pregnancy. After surgery, the animals were returned to their cages. 48 h after the surgery, the animals were killed, uteri were collected, and mRNAs were isolated for Northern blot analysis. The blot was hybridized with 32P-labeled probes containing CT, E-cadherin, and GAPDH cDNA sequences. To investigate the regulation of cellular functions by CT and its receptor, human endometrial adenocarcinoma (glandular origin) Ishikawa cells present a convenient model system. These cells, like normal preimplantation uterine epithelial cells, harbor estrogen and progesterone receptors and retain a response to these steroid hormones. Because the responsiveness of a target cell to CT is dependent upon the presence of the cognate receptors on the cell surface, we first ascertained that CTRs are indeed expressed in Ishikawa cells. The human CTR is expressed in two molecular forms, which differ slightly in size (14Kuestner R.E. Elrod R.D. Grant F.J. Hagen F.S. Kuijper J.L. Matthewes S.L. O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Stroop S.D. Thompson D.L. Whitmore T.E. Findlay D.M. Houssami S. Sexton P.M. Moore E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 246-255PubMed Google Scholar). The larger isoform contains a 16-amino acid insert that the shorter form lacks. We initially analyzed the expression of CTR mRNAs in Ishikawa cells by RT-PCR. Because previous reports indicated that T47D cells harbor abundant functional CTRs (14Kuestner R.E. Elrod R.D. Grant F.J. Hagen F.S. Kuijper J.L. Matthewes S.L. O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Stroop S.D. Thompson D.L. Whitmore T.E. Findlay D.M. Houssami S. Sexton P.M. Moore E.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 246-255PubMed Google Scholar), these cells were used as positive control cells. As shown in Fig.1, significant amounts of the two isoforms of CTR mRNAs were detected in Ishikawa cells (lane 2), and the levels of these mRNAs were comparable with those in T47D cells (lane 1). We also determined the number of CT binding sites in Ishikawa cells by using radiolabeled CT. The results of the Scatchard analysis are shown in Table I. The dissociation constants for 125I-CT binding in T47D and Ishikawa cells were statistically equivalent. The number of CT binding sites in T47D and Ishikawa cells were also similar. T47D cells exhibited 3.76 × 104 CT binding sites/cell, whereas the Ishikawa cells harbored 2.78 × 104 CT binding sites/cell. These results indicated that Ishikawa cells are likely to be responsive to CT.Table I125I-sCT binding to Ishikawa cellsCellsK dBinding sites/cellnmIshikawa1.942.78 × 104T47D1.273.76 × 104 Open table in a new tab Binding of CT to CTRs is known to elevate intracellular calcium levels in a variety of cell types, including bone and kidney cells (16Chabre O. Conkin B.R. Lin H.Y. Lodish H.F. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Catanzariti L. Hemmings B.A. Bourne H.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 551-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Force T. Bonventre I.V. Flannery M.R. Gorn A.H. Yamin M. Goldring S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F1110-F1115PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of CT on intracellular calcium levels in Ishikawa cells using fluorescence microscopy. In this experiment, the cells were plated at a density of 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate and loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3 AM. Some of the cells were preloaded with BAPTA-AM, an intracellular calcium chelator. 10 cells in each well were monitored to determine the average fluorescence intensity for calculation of [Ca2+]i. As shown in Fig.2 (top panel), no intracellular calcium elevation was observed when cells were treated with vehicle alone. Treatment of the cells with 3 or 5 nmCT led to a marginal rise in intracellular calcium (Fig. 2,middle panel, left and center images, respectively). Addition of 10 nm CT, however, elicited a sharp rise in intracellular calcium level within 5 s (Fig. 2,middle panel, right image). This rise in intracellular calcium level was blocked when cells were preloaded with BAPTA-AM (Fig. 2, bottom panel), indicating that the increased fluorescence of fluo-3 was specific for calcium. Taken together, these results demonstrated that Ishikawa cells respond to CT through receptor-mediated calcium signaling. An alteration in cellular calcium is known to control adhesiveness and polarity of epithelial cells (18Gumbiner B.M. Stevenson B. Grimaldi A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1575-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Our observation that CT alters the level of intracellular calcium in Ishikawa cells raised the possibility that such alterations may influence cellular adhesiveness by changing the expression or triggering redistribution of critical cell adhesion molecules or junctional complexes. E-cadherin is a cell surface glycoprotein that mediates calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion and is believed to be critical for the establishment and maintenance of adherens junctions in epithelial cells (19Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2948) Google Scholar, 20Huber O. Bierkamp C. Kemler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether treatment with CT altered expression or distribution of E-cadherin in Ishikawa cells. Ishikawa cells grown in a calcium-containing medium to 60–70% confluence were treated with either 100 nm CT or vehicle. 24 h after treatment with CT, the cell surface distribution of E-cadherin was examined by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes E-cadherin. E-cadherin was clearly localized at points of cell-cell contact in the untreated Ishikawa cells (Fig. 3 A,panels B and C, and Fig. 3 B,panel A). Upon treatment with CT, E-cadherin immunostaining at the cell surface was reduced dramatically after 24 h (Fig.3 A, panels b and c, and Fig.3 B, panel B). We also performed a time course to monitor the decline in E-cadherin after 2, 6, 12, and 24 h of CT treatment. Our studies detected a marked decline in the level of E-cadherin in response to CT only after 24 h of hormone treatment (data not shown). We next examined the role of CTRs in the CT-induced disappearance of E-cadherin from contact sites of Ishikawa cells. We observed that when the cells were treated with another peptide hormone, CGRP, which does not bind to CTRs, E-cadherin expression at the contact sites of epithelial cells remained unaffected (Fig. 3 B, panel C). Interestingly, when cells were treated with a modified CGRP (8-37), which binds to CTRs and functions as an agonist (40Chiba T. Yamaguchi A. Yamatani T. Nakamura A. Morishita T. Inui T. Fukase M. Noda T. Fujita T. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: E331-E335PubMed Google Scholar), E-cadherin expression at the points of cell-cell contact declined (Fig.3 B, panel D), indicating that the effect of CT is dependent on CTR-mediated signaling. We next tested the hypothesis that the CT-induced rise in intracellular calcium is a critical upstream event for the observed loss of E-cadherin from the cell-cell junctions. We therefore treated the cells with BAPTA-AM, which effectively chelates intracellular calcium. We found that in the presence of BAPTA-AM, CT failed to induce a loss of E-cadherin from the cell-cell contact sites (Fig.3 B, panel E). These results suggested that this effect is indeed triggered by an intracellular calcium spike induced by CT. Collectively, these data are consistent with the view that CT acts through its cell surface receptor to initiate calcium signaling, which, through a cascade of events, eventually alters the expression of E-cadherin in epithelial cells. We next investigated whether the CT-induced change in expression of E-cadherin in Ishikawa cells is caused by a down-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA. Ishikawa cells were grown to 60–70% confluence and treated with CT or vehicle. 24 h after treatment, cells were harvested to isolate mRNA for Northern blot analysis. Our results showed that significant amounts of E-cadherin mRNA were present in Ishikawa cells treated with vehicle alone (Fig.4, lanes 1 and 2). The addition of CT to Ishikawa cells led to a marked decline in the level of E-cadherin mRNA (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and4). The relative levels of expression of E-cadherin mRNA in Ishikawa cells treated with or without CT were estimated by densitometric scanning followed by normalization with respect to the control GAPDH mRNA signal. By our estimate, the magnitude of E-cadherin mRNA reduction in Ishikawa cells upon CT administration was greater than 60%. The calcium signaling induced by CT is therefore transduced by an unknown second messenger pathway(s) to down-regulate expression of E-cadherin gene in Ishikawa cells. Our previous studies showed that CT is transiently induced in rat endometrial epithelium within the implantation window (10Ding Y.Q. Zhu L.J. Bagchi M.K. Bagchi I.C."
https://openalex.org/W2035542663,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays an essential role in eukaryotic DNA replication, and numerous DNA replication proteins have been found to interact with PCNA through a conserved eight-amino acid motif called the PIP-box. We have searched the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for open reading frames that encode proteins with putative PIP-boxes and initiated testing of 135 novel candidates for their ability to interact with PCNA-conjugated agarose beads. The first new PCNA-binding protein identified in this manner is the 5′ to 3′ DNA helicase RRM3. Yeast two-hybrid tests show that N-terminal deletions of RRM3, which remove the PIP-box but leave the helicase motifs intact, abolish the interaction with PCNA. In addition, mutating the two phenylalanine residues in the PIP-box to alanine or aspartic acid reduces binding to PCNA, confirming that the PIP-box in RRM3 is responsible for interaction with PCNA. The results presented here suggest that the RRM3 helicase functions at the replication fork. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) plays an essential role in eukaryotic DNA replication, and numerous DNA replication proteins have been found to interact with PCNA through a conserved eight-amino acid motif called the PIP-box. We have searched the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for open reading frames that encode proteins with putative PIP-boxes and initiated testing of 135 novel candidates for their ability to interact with PCNA-conjugated agarose beads. The first new PCNA-binding protein identified in this manner is the 5′ to 3′ DNA helicase RRM3. Yeast two-hybrid tests show that N-terminal deletions of RRM3, which remove the PIP-box but leave the helicase motifs intact, abolish the interaction with PCNA. In addition, mutating the two phenylalanine residues in the PIP-box to alanine or aspartic acid reduces binding to PCNA, confirming that the PIP-box in RRM3 is responsible for interaction with PCNA. The results presented here suggest that the RRM3 helicase functions at the replication fork. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; hPCNA, human PCNA; ORF, open reading frame; SC media, synthetic complete media; rDNA, ribosomal DNA.1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; hPCNA, human PCNA; ORF, open reading frame; SC media, synthetic complete media; rDNA, ribosomal DNA. is an essential eukaryotic DNA replication factor. It functions as a homotrimer that forms a clamp that slides along double-stranded DNA serving as a processivity factor for DNA polymerases and as an attachment site for numerous other replication proteins (1Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Google Scholar). Similar processivity factors for DNA polymerases have been characterized in a wide spectrum of organisms and include gp45 of T4 bacteriophage (2Moarefi I. Jeruzalmi D. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1215-1223Google Scholar) and the β-subunit of polymerase III of Escherichia coli (3Kong X.P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Google Scholar). Despite sometimes low sequence similarity among members of this class of proteins, their three-dimensional structures are highly conserved, suggesting that their function has remained unchanged throughout evolution (4Kelman Z. O'Donnell M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3613-3620Google Scholar).Our initial understanding of how PCNA interacts with other proteins comes from structural studies of the interaction between PCNA and p21WAF1/CIP1. The ability of human PCNA (hPCNA) to interact with DNA polymerases can be inhibited by p21WAF1/CIP1, an inhibitor of DNA replication that controls S-phase entry by binding hPCNA (5Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Google Scholar, 6Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z.Q. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Google Scholar). As revealed by co-crystallization of hPCNA and a peptide derived from the C terminus of p21, this interaction mainly occurs between a hydrophobic stretch of 8 amino acids in p21 (144QTSMTDFY151) and a hydrophobic pocket under the interdomain connector loop of hPCNA (7Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Google Scholar). In addition, basic residues like lysine and arginine that are located N-terminal to the p21WAF1/CIP1 motif participate in the interaction by contacting the highly acidic C terminus of hPCNA (7Gulbis J.M. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 297-306Google Scholar).Eukaryotic DNA-sliding clamps not only serve as the polymerase processivity factors but also provide attachment sites for various other proteins that function in DNA replication (RAD27, DNA ligase), DNA repair (MSH3, MSH6, UNG1) and chromatin assembly (CAC1) (Refs.8Chen U. Chen S. Saha P. Dutta A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11597-11602Google Scholar, 9Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Woloschak G.E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2001; 77: 1007-1021Google Scholar). A p21-like PCNA-interaction motif, called a PIP-box, with the consensus sequence QXX(M/I/L)XX(F/Y)(F/Y), has been identified in all of these proteins, suggesting that they all bind to the same site on PCNA (1Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Google Scholar, 14Krawitz D.C. Kama T. Kaufman P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 614-625Google Scholar). Most PIP-boxes were found near the N or C terminus of the protein, which probably facilitates their interaction with PCNA by exposing a flexible peptide on the protein surface. There is also evidence that PCNA does more than simply provide a docking port for components of the replisome. PCNA has recently been shown to influence the catalytic activity of interacting proteins such as DNA ligase (16Tom S. Henricksen L.A. Park M.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24817-24825Google Scholar) and FEN1 (17Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Google Scholar), to increase the substrate specificity of the MSH2·MSH6 mismatch repair complex (10Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Google Scholar), and to affect the phosphorylation status of RFC1 and DNA ligase (18Koundrioukoff S. Jonsson Z.O. Hasan S. de Jong R.N. van der Vliet P.C. Hottiger M.O. Hubscher U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22882-22887Google Scholar).Because the discovery of new PCNA-interacting proteins continues, and as more effects of these interactions on protein activity are revealed, new roles for PCNA beyond its primary function as a polymerase processivity factor may be identified. By searching the protein sequences encoded by more than 6000 open reading frames (ORFs) in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have identified 144 known or hypothetical proteins that contain the PIP-box consensus sequence. We have initiated a project with the aim to test all novel candidates for their ability to interact with PCNA of S. cerevisiae using in vitro and in vivomethods. Here we present the examination of the first 26 candidates, among which we have identified RRM3 as a PCNA-interacting protein. RRM3 is a 5′-3′ DNA helicase of the PIF1 family (19Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar, 20Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Schulz V.P. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1383-1396Google Scholar) and has been shown to be required for the stability of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (21Keil R.L. McWilliams A.D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 711-718Google Scholar), for the inhibition of Ty1 transposition (22Scholes D.T. Banerjee M. Bowen B. Curcio M.J. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1449-1465Google Scholar), and for telomere replication (20Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Schulz V.P. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1383-1396Google Scholar). We show that RRM3 interacts directly with PCNA in vitro and in vivo and that the interaction with PCNA is promoted by salt, suggesting a hydrophobic interaction. Using two-hybrid analysis we show that the interaction between RRM3 and PCNA depends on the presence of a canonical PIP-box motif at the N terminus of RRM3, and we propose that interaction between RRM3 and PCNA may be important for replication fork progression and for inhibition of site-specific hyper-recombination.DISCUSSIONWe have identified 144 ORFs in the genome of S. cerevisiae that encode proteins with the PIP-box consensus sequence, QXX(M/I/L)XX(F/Y)(F/Y). Among them are nine proteins that have previously been shown to interact with PCNA (POL32, RAD27, MSH3, MSH6, UNG1, POL2, RFC1, CAC1, and DNA ligase). We have initiated a study with the aim to test all 135 new candidates for their ability to interact with PCNA. In the study presented here we have tested 26 candidates, most of which were chosen because the PIP-box was located near the N or C terminus of the protein or the protein was implicated in DNA metabolism, and we found that one of these candidates, the RRM3 helicase, interacts with PCNA. Fifteen of these 26 candidates did not interact with PCNA in the pull-down assay, suggesting that many PIP-box-containing proteins do not interact with PCNA. Consistent with this, most of these 15 proteins whose function is known do not have a function that suggests they might interact with PCNA (Table I). The remaining 109 candidates as well as the 9 candidates that nonspecifically precipitated with PCNA beads (Table I, group No. 3) will be tested for PCNA interaction using other assays including a yeast two-hybrid assay. Of these 118 candidates, 4 are known to function in DNA metabolism, making them the most logical candidates for testing. It is difficult to predict whether more PCNA-binding proteins will be identified among the remaining candidates since knowledge about their biological function and subcellular localization is often very limited.The RRM3 gene (ribosomal DNArecombination mutation 3) was first identified in a screen for suppressors of recombination between naturally occurring tandem repeats such as the rDNA genes and the copper chelation genes CUP1A and CUP1B(21Keil R.L. McWilliams A.D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 711-718Google Scholar). The RRM3 gene product is 38% identical to 485 amino acids spanning the helicase domain of PIF1, an ATP-dependent 5′-3′ DNA helicase that is involved in the maintenance of telomeric, ribosomal, and mitochondrial DNA (28Lahaye A. Stahl H. Thines-Sempoux D. Foury F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 997-1007Google Scholar). Like PIF1, RRM3 possesses 5′-3′ helicase activity (20Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Schulz V.P. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1383-1396Google Scholar), and its role in rDNA replication has been studied in great detail. Ivessa et al.(19Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar) observe that in the absence of RRM3 activity replication pauses at a number of specific sites within rDNA repeats and that replication forks converging at the replication fork barrier are unusually persistent. The rrm3 mutants exhibit RAD52-dependent accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles and an increased presence of Holliday junctions (19Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar). This suggested that pause sites are eventually converted into double-strand breaks that are then repaired by homologous recombination, which can result in the formation of rDNA circles. Interestingly, replication pause sites within the rDNA repeats coincided with sites that are bound by proteins, and it was therefore suggested that RRM3 might be required to replicate through such protein-rDNA complexes (19Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar, 29Bessler J.B. Torredagger J.Z. Zakian V.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 60-65Google Scholar). Furthermore, the report of telomere instability and destabilization of mitochondrial DNA in rrm3 mutants may suggest that RRM3 also contributes to faithful replication by unwinding DNA secondary structures that are found at these sites (19Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar).In addition to its role in maintaining the stability of direct tandem repeats a recent study has identified RRM3 as a regulator of Ty1 transposition in yeast (22Scholes D.T. Banerjee M. Bowen B. Curcio M.J. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1449-1465Google Scholar). A 110-fold increase in transposition events occurred in rrm3 mutants despite the absence of increased Ty1 transcription. This suggests that RRM3 normally suppresses Ty1 transposition by inhibiting homologous recombination and/or integration at de novo sites. One possible explanation for the large increase in Ty1 transposition could be that in the absence of RRM3, increased DNA breakage occurs due to impaired replication fork progression, and this would result in a larger number of potential integration sites for Ty1 elements.Taken together the observations discussed above suggest a role for RRM3 in genome replication although probably not as a replicative helicase but rather as an accessory helicase that facilitates progression of replication forks through obstructions such as bound proteins and possibly DNA secondary structure. The ability of RRM3 to directly interact with PCNA might help target RRM3 to these sites when the replication fork encounters them. Because the interaction between RRM3 and PCNA is mediated by the similar PIP-box motif found in many DNA replication proteins that bind PCNA, one can imagine a scenario where replication proteins occupy the interaction site(s) on the PCNA clamp during DNA replication but disengage upon encountering replication blocks, allowing “helper” proteins such as RRM3 to be brought to the stalled fork to deal with specific obstructions.In contrast to a previous study that showed that the interaction between PCNA and the mismatch repair protein MSH6 could be disrupted by a pol30-104 mutation (10Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Google Scholar), we found that thepol30-104 mutation did not interrupt the interaction with RRM3. However, similar to our observation, Gomes and Burgers (17Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Google Scholar) find that the interaction between RAD27 and PCNA-90, which contains P252A and K253A amino acid substitutions, was similar to the interaction between the wild type proteins. Interestingly, the mutated residues in PCNA-90 are adjacent to the residue mutated in PCNA-104 (A251V), which is consistent with our observation that the interaction with RRM3 was unaffected by the PCNA-104 mutation. Although the contrasting findings on the interaction between PCNA and RRM3 or RAD27 (17Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Google Scholar) compared with the interaction between PCNA and MSH2-MSH6 (10Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Google Scholar) could be attributed to differences under “Experimental Procedures,” they could also be an indication that the various PIP-box proteins bind to PCNA with different affinities or include multiple sites despite the fact that they all interact via a conserved binding motif. To further elucidate this question we are currently investigating the ability of RRM3 to interact with various PCNA mutants.It is interesting to note that the closely related PIF1 helicase may also interact with PCNA but indirectly through its ability to interact with the chromatin-assembly factor subunit CAC1, which is also a PCNA-interacting protein (13Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Google Scholar, 30Monson E.K. de Bruin D. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13081-13086Google Scholar). The N terminus of PIF1 contains the CAC1-interacting region, which is similar to the observation that the N terminus of RRM3 contains the PCNA-interaction region. This supports a previous suggestion that within the PIF1 family of DNA helicases functional specificity may be achieved by varying protein-protein interactions at the N terminus while the helicase motif region is highly conserved (29Bessler J.B. Torredagger J.Z. Zakian V.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 60-65Google Scholar). One can speculate that the opposing roles of RRM3 and PIF1 in telomere elongation and rDNA replication (29Bessler J.B. Torredagger J.Z. Zakian V.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 60-65Google Scholar) may be the result of competition between RRM3 and the PIF1·CAC1 complex for binding to PCNA, and this competition then regulates such processes as telomere elongation and rDNA replication.

Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar) observe that in the absence of RRM3 activity replication pauses at a number of specific sites within rDNA repeats and that replication forks converging at the replication fork barrier are unusually persistent. The rrm3 mutants exhibit RAD52-dependent accumulation of extrachromosomal rDNA circles and an increased presence of Holliday junctions (19Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar). This suggested that pause sites are eventually converted into double-strand breaks that are then repaired by homologous recombination, which can result in the formation of rDNA circles. Interestingly, replication pause sites within the rDNA repeats coincided with sites that are bound by proteins, and it was therefore suggested that RRM3 might be required to replicate through such protein-rDNA complexes (19Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar, 29Bessler J.B. Torredagger J.Z. Zakian V.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 60-65Google Scholar). Furthermore, the report of telomere instability and destabilization of mitochondrial DNA in rrm3 mutants may suggest that RRM3 also contributes to faithful replication by unwinding DNA secondary structures that are found at these sites (19Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Zakian V.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 479-489Google Scholar).In addition to its role in maintaining the stability of direct tandem repeats a recent study has identified RRM3 as a regulator of Ty1 transposition in yeast (22Scholes D.T. Banerjee M. Bowen B. Curcio M.J. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1449-1465Google Scholar). A 110-fold increase in transposition events occurred in rrm3 mutants despite the absence of increased Ty1 transcription. This suggests that RRM3 normally suppresses Ty1 transposition by inhibiting homologous recombination and/or integration at de novo sites. One possible explanation for the large increase in Ty1 transposition could be that in the absence of RRM3, increased DNA breakage occurs due to impaired replication fork progression, and this would result in a larger number of potential integration sites for Ty1 elements.Taken together the observations discussed above suggest a role for RRM3 in genome replication although probably not as a replicative helicase but rather as an accessory helicase that facilitates progression of replication forks through obstructions such as bound proteins and possibly DNA secondary structure. The ability of RRM3 to directly interact with PCNA might help target RRM3 to these sites when the replication fork encounters them. Because the interaction between RRM3 and PCNA is mediated by the similar PIP-box motif found in many DNA replication proteins that bind PCNA, one can imagine a scenario where replication proteins occupy the interaction site(s) on the PCNA clamp during DNA replication but disengage upon encountering replication blocks, allowing “helper” proteins such as RRM3 to be brought to the stalled fork to deal with specific obstructions.In contrast to a previous study that showed that the interaction between PCNA and the mismatch repair protein MSH6 could be disrupted by a pol30-104 mutation (10Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Google Scholar), we found that thepol30-104 mutation did not interrupt the interaction with RRM3. However, similar to our observation, Gomes and Burgers (17Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Google Scholar) find that the interaction between RAD27 and PCNA-90, which contains P252A and K253A amino acid substitutions, was similar to the interaction between the wild type proteins. Interestingly, the mutated residues in PCNA-90 are adjacent to the residue mutated in PCNA-104 (A251V), which is consistent with our observation that the interaction with RRM3 was unaffected by the PCNA-104 mutation. Although the contrasting findings on the interaction between PCNA and RRM3 or RAD27 (17Gomes X.V. Burgers P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3811-3821Google Scholar) compared with the interaction between PCNA and MSH2-MSH6 (10Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Google Scholar) could be attributed to differences under “Experimental Procedures,” they could also be an indication that the various PIP-box proteins bind to PCNA with different affinities or include multiple sites despite the fact that they all interact via a conserved binding motif. To further elucidate this question we are currently investigating the ability of RRM3 to interact with various PCNA mutants.It is interesting to note that the closely related PIF1 helicase may also interact with PCNA but indirectly through its ability to interact with the chromatin-assembly factor subunit CAC1, which is also a PCNA-interacting protein (13Shibahara K. Stillman B. Cell. 1999; 96: 575-585Google Scholar, 30Monson E.K. de Bruin D. Zakian V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13081-13086Google Scholar). The N terminus of PIF1 contains the CAC1-interacting region, which is similar to the observation that the N terminus of RRM3 contains the PCNA-interaction region. This supports a previous suggestion that within the PIF1 family of DNA helicases functional specificity may be achieved by varying protein-protein interactions at the N terminus while the helicase motif region is highly conserved (29Bessler J.B. Torredagger J.Z. Zakian V.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 60-65Google Scholar). One can speculate that the opposing roles of RRM3 and PIF1 in telomere elongation and rDNA replication (29Bessler J.B. Torredagger J.Z. Zakian V.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 60-65Google Scholar) may be the result of competition between RRM3 and the PIF1·CAC1 complex for binding to PCNA, and this competition then regulates such processes as telomere elongation and rDNA replication. We have identified 144 ORFs in the genome of S. cerevisiae that encode proteins with the PIP-box consensus sequence, QXX(M/I/L)XX(F/Y)(F/Y). Among them are nine proteins that have previously been shown to interact with PCNA (POL32, RAD27, MSH3, MSH6, UNG1, POL2, RFC1, CAC1, and DNA ligase). We have initiated a study with the aim to test all 135 new candidates for their ability to interact with PCNA. In the study presented here we have tested 26 candidates, most of which were chosen because the PIP-box was located near the N or C terminus of the protein or the protein was implicated in DNA metabolism, and we found that one of these candidates, the RRM3 helicase, interacts with PCNA. Fifteen of these 26 candidates did not interact with PCNA in the pull-down assay, suggesting that many PIP-box-containing proteins do not interact with PCNA. Consistent with this, most of these 15 proteins whose function is known do not have a function that suggests they might interact with PCNA (Table I). The remaining 109 candidates as well as the 9 candidates that nonspecifically precipitated with PCNA beads (Table I, group No. 3) will be tested for PCNA interaction using other assays including a yeast two-hybrid assay. Of these 118 candidates, 4 are known to function in DNA metabolism, making them the most logical candidates for testing. It is difficult to predict whether more PCNA-binding proteins will be identified among the remaining candidates since knowledge about their biological function and subcellular localization is often very limited. The RRM3 gene (ribosomal DNArecombination mutation 3) was first identified in a screen for suppressors of recombination between naturally occurring tandem repeats such as the rDNA genes and the copper chelation genes CUP1A and CUP1B(21Keil R.L. McWilliams A.D. Genetics. 1993; 135: 711-718Google Scholar). The RRM3 gene product is 38% identical to 485 amino acids spanning the helicase domain of PIF1, an ATP-dependent 5′-3′ DNA helicase that is involved in the maintenance of telomeric, ribosomal, and mitochondrial DNA (28Lahaye A. Stahl H. Thines-Sempoux D. Foury F. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 997-1007Google Scholar). Like PIF1, RRM3 possesses 5′-3′ helicase activity (20Ivessa A.S. Zhou J.Q. Schulz V.P. Monson E.K. Zakian V.A.

https://openalex.org/W2049824528,"The crystal structure is presented of a complex formed by the interacting domains from two subunits of the general transcription factor TFIID, the human TATA binding protein-associated factors hTAF4 (hTAFII135) and hTAF12 (hTAFII20). In agreement with predictions, hTAF12 forms a histone fold that is very similar to that of histone H2B, yet unexpected differences are observed between the structures of the hTAF12 interaction domain of hTAF4 and histone H2A. Most importantly, the hTAF4 fragment forms only the first two helices of a classical histone fold, which are followed by a 26-residue disordered region. This indicates that either full-length TAF4 contains an unusually long connecting loop between its second and third helix, and this helix is not required for stable interaction with TAF12, or that TAF4 represents a novel class of partial histone fold motifs. Structural models and structure-based sequence alignments support a role for TAF4b and hSTAF42/yADA1 as alternative partners for TAF12 and are consistent with the formation of nucleosome-like histone-fold octamers through interaction of TAF12 with a TAF6–TAF9 tetramer, yet argue against involvement of TAF12-containing histone-fold pairs in DNA binding.

TFIID is one of the central factors that control transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (for recent reviews, see Gangloffet al. (1Gangloff Y.G. Romier C. Thuault S. Werten S. Davidson I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 250-257Google Scholar), Bell and Tora (2Bell B. Tora L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 11-19Google Scholar)). The complex is composed of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; TAF, TBP-associated factor; TF, transcription factor. and at least fourteen TBP-associated factors (TAFs). Via its TBP subunit, TFIID binds to the TATA element that is present in the majority of core promoters, an event thought to constitute the first step in RNA polymerase II preinitiation complex assembly (3Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 327-335Google Scholar). On a subset of promoters, DNA binding may be enhanced by some of the TAFs, through specific recognition of additional sequence elements. For instance, TAF6 (human (h) TAFII80) and TAF9 (hTAFII31) are thought to interact with the downstream promoter element (4Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Google Scholar), whereas TAF1 (hTAFII250) and TAF2 (hTAFII150) may bind to the initiator element (5Verrijzer C.P. Yokomori K. Chen J.L. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 264: 933-941Google Scholar, 6Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.-L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Google Scholar, 7Chalkley G.E. Verrijzer C.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4835-4845Google Scholar). Furthermore, a double bromodomain enables TAF1 to interact with acetylated histone tails in chromatin (8Jacobson R.H. Ladkurner A.G. King D.S. Tjian R. Science. 2000; 288: 1422-1425Google Scholar). The latter TAF in addition has multiple enzymatic activities (kinase, acetyl transferase, and ubiquitination activity; for review see Wassarman and Sauer (9Wassarman D.A. Sauer F. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2895-2902Google Scholar)), allowing it to covalently modify various proteins, including histones and other transcription (co)factors. Although the precise roles played by the remaining TAFs are considerably more elusive, many of them have been reported to interact with transcription activation domains of gene-specific activators. This suggests that through these TAFs, the TFIID complex acts as an integration point for regulatory cues. It is likely that TAF-activator contacts either stabilize the preinitiation complex or induce essential structural changes in it. Most of the TAF components of TFIID engage in alternative interactions, giving rise to transcription complexes of varying functionality. On the one hand, tissue-specific homologs of Drosophila (d) TAF4 (10Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Google Scholar) and dTAF5 (dTAFII80) (11Hiller M.A. Lin T.-Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Google Scholar) have been found that can replace these TAFs in TFIID to produce specialized versions of the complex. Both of the alternative TAFs have been shown to be required for normal development of tissues in which they occur (11Hiller M.A. Lin T.-Y. Wood C. Fuller M.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1021-1030Google Scholar, 12Freiman R.N. Albright S.R. Zheng S. Sha W.C. Hammer R.E. Tjian R. Science. 2001; 293: 2084-2087Google Scholar). On the other hand, many TAFs are not only present in TFIID, but also in one or more other global regulators of transcription by RNA polymerase II that lack TBP, such as the yeast SAGA and human STAGA, PCAF, and TFTC histone-acetylating complexes (2Bell B. Tora L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 11-19Google Scholar, 13Struhl K. Moqtaderi Z. Cell. 2000; 94: 1-4Google Scholar, 14Brown C.E. Lechner T. Howe L. Workman J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 15-19Google Scholar) and the Polycomb group repressor complex PRC1 (15Saurin A.J. Shao Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 655-660Google Scholar). Interestingly, yeast (y) TFIID may be replaced by TBP alone on some promoters, according to recent studies (16Kuras L. Kosa P. Mencia M. Struhl K. Science. 2000; 288: 1244-1248Google Scholar, 17Li X.Y. Bhaumik S.R. Green M.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1242-1244Google Scholar). Thus, a cofactor role for TAFs is emerging, a notion supported by numerous inactivation studies that indicate that various TAFs influence transcription of large, non-identical but overlapping subsets of genes (18Lee T.I. Causton H.C. Holstege F.C.P. Shen W.C. Hannett N. Jennings E.G. Winston F. Green M.R. Young R.A. Nature. 2000; 405: 701-704Google Scholar, 19Holstege F.C.P. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S. Young R.A. Cell. 1998; 95: 717-728Google Scholar, 20Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A. Holstege F.C.P. Wang J. Young R.A. Green M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 653-661Google Scholar). However, in what fashion the intricate cross-talk through exchange of oligomerization partners between the TAFs within TFIID and other transcription complexes takes place at the structural level is largely unclear. Several TAFs have been reported to interact via histone-fold motifs (for review, see Gangloff et al. (1Gangloff Y.G. Romier C. Thuault S. Werten S. Davidson I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 250-257Google Scholar)). The observation that TAF6, TAF9, and TAF12 show homology with histones H4, H3, and H2B, respectively, led to the hypothesis that TFIID contains a core structure resembling the histone octamer that organizes genomic DNA into nucleosomes (21Hoffmann A. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18194-18202Google Scholar). Subsequent studies even hinted at DNA binding by these TAFs in a nucleosome-like manner (22Oelgeschlager T. Chiang C.M. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 382: 735-738Google Scholar). The core TFIID structure was believed to be composed of a H3/H4-like tetramer formed by TAF6 and TAF9 (23Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A. Hoffmann A. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 316-322Google Scholar) plus two putative homodimers of the H2B-like subunit, TAF12. Because all of these histone-like TAFs either belong to the family of “shared” TAFs or are replaced by highly homologous proteins in other global transcription regulators, a similar structure would be likely to exist in the SAGA/STAGA, TFTC, PCAF, and PRC1. However, several recent observations suggest that the network of histone-fold proteins within TFIID is more complicated than initially anticipated. First, a crystallographic study revealed that hTAF11 (hTAFII28) and hTAF13 (hTAFII18) also contain histone folds, although this feature had gone unnoticed in the initial sequence comparisons of TAF-proteins (24Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Ru M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.-C. Davidson I. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 94: 1-20Google Scholar). Furthermore, instead of forming homodimers, the putative hTAF12 histone-fold domain interacts strongly with a conserved 70-amino acid region of hTAF4, likely constituting a novel histone-like heterodimer within TFIID (25Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Google Scholar). Here, we describe the crystal structure of the complex formed by the interacting regions of hTAF4 and hTAF12, confirming their specific association into heterodimers. The structure reveals that hTAF12 indeed forms the anticipated H2B-like histone fold, but surprisingly, hTAF4 interacts with this motif via a partial histone fold consisting of two helices only. The region expected to form the C-terminal portion of the hTAF4 histone fold on the basis of alignments is found to be disordered. This suggests that a third helix is located downstream from the region included in our crystallographic study, and connected to the histone fold by an atypically long linker, or, alternatively, that hTAF4 represents a novel variant of the histone fold that lacks a third helix altogether. Functional and biochemical analysis of yTAF4 (45Thuault S. Gangloff Y.-G. Kirchner J. Steven Sanders S. Werten S. Romier C. Weil P.A. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45510-45517Google Scholar) provides evidence supporting the idea that an α3 helix is present in a strongly conserved domain at the C terminus of the TAF4 proteins. Conservation of core residues of TAF4 in TAF4b (hTAFII105) and hSTAT42/yADA1 agrees with the proposed roles for the latter two proteins as alternative histone-like interaction partners for TAF12 in a specialized TFIID complex and the S(T)AGA coactivator complex, respectively. Model building supports the hypothesis that two copies of the TAF4-TAF12 complex interact through four-helix bundles with a heterotetramer consisting of TAF6 and TAF9 to form an octameric complex analogous to the histone core of the nucleosome. Because the surface of the TAF4-TAF12 complex is mostly negatively charged, and side chains that mediate contacts between the H2A-H2B complex and DNA have not been conserved in the TAFs, involvement of the histone fold domains in nucleosome-like DNA wrapping is nevertheless unlikely. The predicted histone-fold region of hTAF12 (amino acids 57–128) and the region of hTAF4 that interacts with it (amino acids 870–943) were coexpressed inEscherichia coli using pET-15b and pACYC-11b constructs as described (25Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Google Scholar, 26Fribourg S. Romier C. Werten S. Ganglo Y.G. Poterszman A. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 363-373Google Scholar). Bacteria were resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Bis-Tris/HCl pH 6.0, 400 mm NaCl) and lysed by sonication. The protein complex, present in the soluble fraction, was purified by means of cobalt-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Talon Affinity Resin, Clontech) in buffer A and gel filtration (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences) in buffer B (25 mm Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl). The histidine tag at the N terminus of hTAF12 was removed by incubation with thrombin (Sigma) in buffer B, followed by an additional, identical, gel filtration step. Prior to crystallization, dithiothreitol was added to 5 mm, and the complex was concentrated to 10–15 mg/ml by means of Macrosep spin dialysis tubes (molecular mass cutoff 3 kDa, Pall Filtron Corporation). A derivative containing selenomethionine (Se-Met) was prepared in similar fashion, starting from a culture of B834 (DE3) bacteria grown on M9 minimal medium (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Both the native and the Se-containing complex were verified by mass spectrometry. Monoclinic crystals of native and Se-Met hTAF4-hTAF12 complexes were obtained via the hanging-drop method at 24 °C, using a reservoir buffer containing 100 mm sodium acetate pH 5.25 and 2.2m (NH4)2SO4. Crystallization droplets were produced by mixing equal volumes of the concentrated protein and the reservoir buffer. Thin platelets with typical dimensions around 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.05 mm grew within 1 week. Prior to flash-freezing in liquid ethane, these crystals were equilibrated in stepwise fashion in a cryoprotectant buffer containing 100 mm sodium acetate pH 5.25, 2.4 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.4 m NaCl, and increasing concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25%) of glycerol (10 s for each incubation step). Although most of these crystals diffracted to ∼2.8 Å, diffraction patterns typically contained mostly elongated, smeary spots that could not be integrated accurately. Adapting the crystallization conditions, changing the cryoprotection procedure, crystal annealing, or measuring crystals in capillaries at 4 °C did not alter this. However, of a large number of frozen crystals (around 50), a few could be identified that produced a better spot shape and in addition, diffracted to higher resolution. Using one of these, multiple anomalous diffraction data up to 2.3 Å were collected at 100 K on beamline BW7A at Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, Hamburg (wavelengths: 0.97740 and 0.90730 Å). Crystals belong to space group C2, with a = 112.9 Å,b = 36.8 Å, c = 73.9 Å, and β = 97.9°. The asymmetric unit contains two heterodimers of hTAF12 and hTAF4, resulting in a Matthews coefficient of 2.2 and an estimated solvent content of 42%. Tetragonal crystals with dimensions up to 0.2 × 0.2 × 2.0 mm grew between several weeks and several months, when using 100 mm [(carbamoylmethyl)imino]diacetic acid (ADA) pH 6.5, 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4, and 10 mm MgSO4 as the reservoir buffer (again, crystallization droplets were produced by mixing equal volumes of the concentrated protein and the reservoir buffer). During the long crystallization period, the (NH4)2SO4 concentration increased to values up to 3 m due to evaporation of water from the wells. Before flash-freezing in liquid ethane, crystals were equillibrated in stepwise fashion in a cryoprotectant buffer containing 100 mm ADA pH 6.5, 3.0 m(NH4)2SO4, 10 mmMgSO4, and increasing concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25%) of glycerol (10 s for each incubation step). The tetragonal crystals did not produce the smeary diffraction spots typical of the C2 form but diffracted more weakly. Also, Se-Met crystals for this form could not be obtained. Native data to 3.1 Å were measured at 100 K on beamline ID14–3 at European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. The crystals belong to space group P43212, with a =b = 67.5 Å and c = 127.3 Å. The asymmetric unit contains 2 heterodimers of hTAF4 and hTAF12, resulting in a Matthews coefficient of 2.1 and an estimated solvent content of 40%. All data sets were processed and scaled using the programs Denzo and Scalepack, versions 1.96.7 (28Otwinowski Z. Data Collection and Processing..in: Sawyer L. Isaacs N.W. Bailey S.

The structure of the complex was solved by multiple anomalous diffraction of the Se-Met containing C2 crystals using Solve 1.17 (29Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Cryst. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar) for initial phase determination. All eight Se sites could be determined automatically by the program. After density modification of the resulting map in CNS 1.1 (30Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Google Scholar), clear electron density was observed for the entire complex, except for a small number of residues in loop regions. Model building and refinement were carried out using the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Cryst. Sec.

Atomic coordinates and diffraction data have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB ID codes 1h3o and r1h3osf, respectively).

RMS, root mean square. Construction of a model for the putative (hTAF6-hTAF9)2-2(hTAF4-hTAF12) octamer was carried out in O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Cryst. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). First, a homology model of the hTAF6-hTAF9 heterodimer was constructed on the basis of the dTAF6-dTAF9 structure by Xie et al. (23Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A. Hoffmann A. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 316-322Google Scholar), by manually replacing all non-conserved residues. The resulting model was superimposed onto the crystal structure of the nucleosome core particle (36Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-259Google Scholar) so as to optimize the fit between the Cα atoms of residues 53–77 of hTAF6 and the corresponding residues (68–92) of H4. This region in H4 corresponds to the part of the protein that contacts H2B. Next, a hTAF4-hTAF12 heterodimer was docked onto the tetramer by fitting residues 102–123 of hTAF12 to residues 77–98 of H2B, the region that contacts H4. Side-chain conformations in the interface area were modified manually to mimic the residues in the histones as closely as possible. The second half of the octamer was produced through application of the symmetry operator that generates the tetramer in the Xie et al. crystal structure. Initial crystallization trials were undertaken with the predicted hTAF12 histone-fold region (residues 57–128) carrying an N-terminal histidine tag and an untagged fragment (residues 870–952) of hTAF4, comprising the presumed histone fold domain and C-terminal flanking region (37Gangloff Y.G. Sanders Stephen L. Romier C. Kirschner D. Weil P.A. Tora L. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1841-1853Google Scholar). Large single crystals of this complex were obtained that did not diffract beyond 8 Å. When the protein content of some of the crystals was analyzed by mass spectrometry, a small fraction (roughly 10%) of hTAF4 was found to be truncated by 9 amino acids at its C terminus. A construct corresponding to this breakdown product (residues 870–943) was coexpressed with the histidine-tagged hTAF12 construct as before. The new complex gave rise to morphologically identical crystals in similar conditions, but this now required proteolytic removal of the N-terminal histidine tag from hTAF12 (whereas the initial complex had required its presence). Using these crystals, belonging to space group P43212, data could be collected to 3.1 Å. At lower pH, a second crystal form was obtained that belongs to space group C2. These crystals diffracted to around 2.5 Å. We first tried to solve the structure of the complex by molecular replacement, using either unmodified models or alanine models constructed from known histone-fold structures, as well as averages or truncated versions of such models. Because neither P43212 nor C2 data yielded correct solutions, we proceeded to solve the structure by multiple anomalous diffraction, using a selenomethionine-containing complex crystallized in the C2 space group. Table I lists statistics concerning data collection and structure refinement for this crystal form. The lower resolution structure of the P43212 form was subsequently solved by molecular replacement, using the C2 multiple anomalous diffraction structure as a search model. Details of protein production, crystallization and structure determination are given in “Experimental Procedures.” The structure of the hTAF4-hTAF12 complex as determined from the C2 crystal form is depicted in Fig. 1 A. As expected, hTAF12 forms a regular histone fold, consistent with the high degree of homology between this protein and histone H2B. The helical regions and intervening loops of hTAF12 and H2B can be superimposed very well (root mean square deviation = 1.1 Å for Cα atoms). The most significant differences between hTAF12 and H2B (see Fig. 2 A) are a change in orientation of helix α1 and the conformation of the C-terminal extension in hTAF12 (residues 126–128), which folds back onto a surface that in H2B accommodates an additional C-terminal helix (αC, not shown). Density for this extension is only seen in the C2 crystal structure, where it is stabilized by crystal packing contacts.Figure 2Comparison of hTAF4 and hTAF12 to histones H2A and H2B. A, superposition of the hTAF4-hTAF12 heterodimer onto one of the H2A-H2B histone pairs in the structure of the nucleosome core particle (36Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F.

C, structure-based alignment of hTAF4 and histone H2A; residue colors are the same as in panel B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Surprisingly, hTAF4 forms only a partial histone fold, because the C-terminal two turns of the α2 helix, the loop L2, and helix α3 are absent from the structure. The C-terminal 26 residues of the polypeptide (residues 918–943) do not appear in the electron density maps, yet mass spectroscopy of redissolved crystals shows that these residues are present and have not been removed by proteolysis (data not shown). Thus, this region must be disordered within the crystal lattice. The presence of a flexible tail of such substantial length (the 26 residues make up 35% of the total chain length of the hTAF4 fragment and account for 18% of the mass of the entire complex) may explain the difficulties in obtaining well diffracting single crystals (see “Experimental Procedures”). Several additional differences can be observed between the structures of hTAF4 and H2A (see Fig. 2 A). First, helix α1 of hTAF4 contains an additional helical turn at its C terminus, and as a consequence the loop between helices α1 and α2 is longer and adopts a partially different conformation. Furthermore, the orientation of both of the helices of hTAF4 with respect to hTAF12 is significantly different from the orientation of the corresponding helices in H2A with respect to H2B. Notwithstanding the considerable structural differences between hTAF4 and H2A, the interaction between hTAF4 and hTAF12 monomers to form heterodimers resembles that observed in H2A-H2B and other histone-fold pairs. Hydrophobic residues on the inside of the crossed-over α2 helices of hTAF4 and hTAF12 form an elongated hydrophobic core, to which a number of residues from the shorter helices and inward-pointing residues from the connecting loops also contribute. The hydrophobic character of each of these residues is conserved in all known homologous TAFs (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition to these interactions, loop L1 of hTAF4 aligns in antiparallel fashion with loop L2 of hTAF12 to form several β-sheet type backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds. Two highly conserved intramolecular networks of multiple salt bridge interactions (Fig. 1 B) stabilize the positioning of the helices and the conformation of the loops in hTAF12. A single intermolecular salt bridge is observed, between residue Asp-89 in the α2 helix of hTAF12 and Arg-879 in the α1 helix of hTAF4, but this contact is not conserved in all species. In our crystals, two hTAF4-hTAF12 heterodimers interact to form a heterotetramer making up the asymmetric unit (see Fig.3 A). Intriguingly, a virtually identical tetrameric arrangement is found in the monoclinic and tetragonal crystal structures (the Cα atoms of the two structures can be superimposed with a RMSD of 1.2 Å), although the packing of the tetramers into the lattice is very different in the two crystal forms (data not shown). The interaction between two heterodimers involves the N-terminal part of the α2 helix of hTAF12 and the C-terminal region of the α2 helix of hTAF4. Hence, the tetrameric arrangement observed does not resemble any of the heterodimer-heterodimer interactions within the nucleosome core particle (see Fig.4 for comparisons). Details of the interaction are shown in Fig 3 B. Three conserved hydrophobic residues of hTAF12 (Val-80, Met-83, and Ile-87) and two from hTAF4 (Leu-911 and Ile-915) associate across the approximate twofold non-crystallographic symmetry axis with the corresponding residues from the second heterodimer to form a hydrophobic interface of considerable dimensions (buried surface area: 500 Å2 per heterodimer). In addition, salt bridges (although not conserved in all species) exist between the two heterodimers, as Asp-77 and Asp-79 of hTAF12 are in contact with Arg-114 of hTAF4. An interesting contribution to the interaction comes from a tight carboxyl-carboxyl contact between the conserved residue Asp-90 of hTAF12 and its non-crystallographic symmetry-related residue. Very clear density is seen for this contact in both crystal structures, even though the tetragonal crystals were grown at pH 6.5. As is often seen for this type of contact (38Flocco M.M. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 96-105Google Scholar), the interaction between the two acidic groups is stabilized by a neighboring residue (Gln-86). Like the interaction between hTAF4-hTAF12 heterodimers within the asymmetric unit, the crystal packing interactions observed between tetramers do not resemble the interaction between H2A-H2B heterodimers in the nucleosome c"

However, instead of releasing sialic acid, TS preferentially transfers sialic acid from β-galactopyranosyl (βGalp)-containing exogenous donor molecules to terminal βGalp-containing acceptors, attaching it in an α2–3 linkage configuration (9Vandekerckhove F.

The Tyr342 residue is involved in the stabilization of the transition-state sialyl carbocation formed during the hydrolysis reaction (4Todeschini A.R. Mendonça-Previato L. Previato J.O.

Indirect evidence suggests that an enzymatically inactive recombinant TS acts as a lectin, agglutinating desialylated erythrocytes (12Cremona M.L. Campetella O. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, no direct evidence for a βGalp binding site or for its role in the parasite host interaction has been established. Trypomastigote-derived TS is anchored to the membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and is released to the extracellular medium during acute T. cruzi infection in humans (13Frasch A.C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 282-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), thus acting distant from the parasite. Besides a role in mammalian cell invasion (14Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. Annu. Rev.

Med. 1995; 181: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) demonstrated thatin vivo injection of minute amounts of purified native TS increases subsequent parasitemia and mortality in T. cruzi-infected mice. As TS injection into severe combined immunodeficiency mice did not affect parasitemia or mortality, it was suggested that TS acts on the host adaptive immune response (15Chuenkova M. Pereira M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is well known that T lymphocytes bearing conventional αβ T cell receptors are required for control of parasitemia and mortality in murine infection by T. cruzi (16DosReis G.A. Parasitol.

Host CD4+ T cells are also involved in the immunopathology ofT. cruzi infection, and their exacerbated function can lead to mortality in susceptible hosts (17Hunter C.A. Ellis-Neys L.A. Slifer T. Kanaly S. Gruning G. Fort M. Rennick D. Araújo F.G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3311-3316PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that both enzymatically active and inactive TS costimulated CD4+T cell activation in vitro and in vivo and blocked activation-induced cell death in CD4+ T cells fromT. cruzi-infected mice through CD43 engagement (18Todeschini A.R.

In the present work, we extended our studies and, using CD43−/− mice, we show that the major lymphocyte mucin CD43 is the counterreceptor for the inactive TS on host CD4+ T cells.

Recombinant active TS (rTS) and inactive TS (irTS), containing the C-terminal repeats, were obtained fromEscherichia coli MC1061 electro-transformed with plasmids containing either the wild-type TS insert, TSREP (11Cremona M.L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. Campetella O. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), or the inactive mutant TS insert bearing a Tyr342 → His substitution, pTrcHisA (11Cremona M.L. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C.C. Campetella O. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 160: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in supplemented Terrific broth in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When the culture reached an A 600 nm of 1.0, 30 mg/liter isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and incubation continued overnight. Bacteria were lysed at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 2.0 mg/ml lysozyme, 2% Triton X-100, 0.1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 μmiodoacetamide. Both rTS and irTS containing a poly-His tag were purified as described by Buschiazzo et al. (20Buschiazzo A. Frasch A.C. Campetella O. Cell. Mol. Biol. (Oxf.). 1996; 42: 703-710PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Todeschini et al. (4Todeschini A.R. Mendonça-Previato L. Previato J.O. Varki A. van Halbeek H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) using Ni2+-chelating chromatography on a HiTrap column and eluted with an imidazole gradient (0–1 m). The eluates were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, further purified by ion exchange chromatography on Mono Q and Mono S columns, applying a linear NaCl gradient (0–1 m), and stored in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, at 4 °C until used. The homogeneity of proteins was evaluated on 10% SDS-PAGE. For flow cytometry (FCM) and Western blotting analyses, irTS was biotin-conjugated as described previously (21Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 340-354Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was assayed by incubating rTS preparations in 5 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence of 0.25 μmol of α2–3-sialyllactose (α2–3-SL) and 0.25 μmol of [d-glucose-1-14C]lactose (400,000 cpm) (4Todeschini A.R. Mendonça-Previato L. Previato J.O. Varki A. van Halbeek H. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was diluted with 1 ml of water and applied to a column containing 1 ml of Dowex 2X8 (acetate form) equilibrated with water. To remove the excess of [d-glucose-1-14C]lactose, the column was washed with 10 ml of water, and sialylated [d-glucose-1-14C]lactose was eluted with 3 ml of 0.8 m ammonium acetate and quantitated by scintillation counting (Beckman LS 6500). One unit was defined as the amount of rTS required to catalyze the incorporation of 1 μmol of sialic acid into lactose per minute. BALB/c mice (male, aging 4–5 weeks) were obtained from Fundação Oswaldo Cruz, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil; CD43−/− and wild-type control mice (22Manjunath N. Correa M. Ardman M. Ardman B. Nature. 1995; 377: 535-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) were from Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brasil, animal facilities. All experiments were conducted according to protocols approved by the Committee on Ethics and Regulations of Animal Use of Instituto de Biofı́sica Carlos Chagas Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. Primary T cell-enriched suspensions were obtained by nylon-wool filtration of fractionated splenocytes depleted of red cells by treatment with Tris-buffered ammonium chloride (23Lopes M.F. Veiga V.F. Santos A.R. Fonseca M.E.F. Dos Reis G.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 744-752PubMed Google Scholar). Purified CD4+ T cells were nylon-nonadherent cells treated with anti-CD8 mAb for 30 min at 4 °C followed by anti-rat Ig κ chain mAb MAR 18.5 plus 10% rabbit complement for 45 min at 37 °C. 1 × 107 CD4+ T cells were lysed in PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μm iodoacetamide, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C under vigorous shaking. After pelleting (10,000 × g for 30 min), the supernatant was precleared overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with 3 μg of anti-CD43 mAb S7 for 2 h at 4 °C, under shaking. Protein G-Sepharose (50 μl) was added and incubated for 3 h. The beads were separated by centrifugation, washed three times, and incubated with SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. The supernatant was run on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked overnight with 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20, incubated with anti-CD43 mAb S7 for 2 h followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The reaction was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) in Hyperfilm-ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions. For irTS immunoprecipitation, streptavidin beads and biotin-conjugated irTS were used. 1 × 107 T cells were resuspended in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 0.05 units of Clostridium perfringens (Type X) sialidase in a total volume of 500 μl. Sialidase was removed by washing three times with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Desialylated T cells (5 × 106) were resialylated by incubation with 0.05 units of recombinant rTS in the presence of 1 mm α2–3-SL for 30 min at room temperature and washed as described above. Desialylated and resialylated T lymphocytes were resuspended in sorting buffer (10 mm PBS, pH 7.4, containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.1 m lactose) incubated with biotin-conjugated irTS for 30 min at 4 °C, washed, stained with PE-conjugated streptavidin, and analyzed by FCM as described below. T cell-enriched suspension was incubated with 10 μg/ml Fc block for 5 min at 4 °C followed by addition of 10 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-CD43 mAb S7 or 10 μg/ml biotin-conjugated irTS for 30 min at 4 °C. The T cells were then washed in sorting buffer, incubated for 30 min with PE-conjugated streptavidin at 4 °C, washed again, and resuspended in 0.4 ml of sorting buffer plus 2% paraformaldehyde. T lymphocytes were gated by forward scatter and side scatter parameters, and 10,000 cells were analyzed on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter Xcalibur system using Cell Quest software. For irTS inhibition assay, biotin-conjugated irTS was preincubated with α2–3- or α2–6-SL in a range of 0–1 mm for 30 min at 4 °C. Analysis of irTS binding to sialic acid-containing molecules was done by ELISA (24Brinkman-van der Linden E.C.M. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8625-8632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Wells in microtiter plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with a monoclonal antibody against the TS repeats (25Costa F. Franchin G. Pereira-Chioccola V.L. Ribeirão M. Schenkman S. Rodrigues M.M. Vaccine. 1998; 16: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (500 ng/well) in 50 mm carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5. The plates were washed with ELISA buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with irTS (500 ng/well) in the same buffer. Plates were blocked with ELISA buffer containing Triton X-100 1% for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently washed. Wells were then incubated with biotin-conjugated PAA probes substituted with sialylated glycans at a final concentration of 5.0 μg/well or a range between 0.25 and 10.0 μg/well for 2 h at room temperature. Following washing, wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, diluted (1:500) in blocking buffer, and developed with the 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diamonium substrate system (100 μl/well). The plates were read at 405 nm in an automatic microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). Control wells received a polyclonal antibody against TS catalytic domain (anti-TS) (25Costa F. Franchin G. Pereira-Chioccola V.L. Ribeirão M. Schenkman S. Rodrigues M.M. Vaccine. 1998; 16: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) (500 ng/well) for 1 h. Both mono- and polyclonal antibodies were generously supplied by Dr. Maurı́cio M. Rodrigues from the Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brasil. The sialylated PAA probes (40 μg) were oxidized with 200 μl of 2 mm NaIO4 in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark and reduced with 200 μl of 10 mm NaBH4in PBS saline for 1 h at 4 °C (24Brinkman-van der Linden E.C.M. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8625-8632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The products were diluted 5× with ELISA buffer and used in the assay. For sham treatment, 2 mm NaIO4 and 10 mmNaBH4 were mixed for 1 h at 4 °C and diluted with ELISA buffer, and sialylated PAA probes were added to this mixture just before use in the assay. Sialylated PAA probes were carboxyl-reduced with sodium borohydride treatment after esterification with iodoethane (24Brinkman-van der Linden E.C.M. Varki A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8625-8632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of lyophilized sialylated PAA probes was solubilized in 350 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide, esterified with 35 μl of CH3CH2I for 1 h at room temperature, and then reduced by addition of 1.115 ml of PBS buffer containing 10 mm NaBH4. The reaction products were diluted 4× with ELISA buffer and directly used in the assay. For sham treatment, the same procedures were performed without adding CH3CH2I. Microtiter plates were coated with biotinylated PAA probes (200 ng/well) overnight at 4 °C in 50 mmcarbonate/bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.5. After blocking with ELISA buffer and subsequent washing, the wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin diluted 1:500 times and developed with 100 μl/well 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diamonium substrate system. The plates were read at 405 nm in an automated microplate reader. α2–3-SL, α2–6-SL, SLeX, or methyl α-mannoside was dissolved in deuterated PBS, pH 7.6 (not corrected for isotope effects). irTS solution in 20 mm Tris-HCl was exchanged with deuterated PBS by gel filtration on a G25 column. 20 μl of a stock solution containing 10 mg/ml of irTS was added to a solution of sialyl glycoside (2 mm final concentration), and the total volume was adjusted to 500 μl. NMR spectra were obtained at a probe temperature of 20 °C on a Bruker DMX 600 equipped with a 5-mm self-shielded gradient triple resonance probe or on a Bruker DRX 600 with a 5-mm triple resonance probe. One-dimensional STD experiments were performed by low power presaturation of the methyl region of the protein during the 2-s relaxation delay. The pulse scheme was as follows: relaxation delay with or without presaturation of the protein resonances, 90 degrees pulse, and acquisition of 256 scans (16,000 points for 10 ppm of spectral width). The data were obtained with interleaved acquisition of on-resonanse and control spectra to minimize the effects of temperature and magnet instability. Total Correlation Spectroscopy (STD-TOCSY) spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 66 ms, 32 scans per t 1 increment. 200t 1 increments were collected in an interlaced mode with presaturation on or off for 2 s. Prior to subtraction, both spectra were processed and phased identically. The acquisition time for the two-dimensional experiments were typically 16 h. The spectra were multiplied with a square cosine bell function in both dimensions and zero-filled two times. All spectra were referenced relative to trimethyl-silyl-2,2′,3,3′-d 4-propionic acid-sodium salt (δ = 0.0 ppm). We recently demonstrated that irTS from T. cruzi binds CD4+ T cells and that this binding is abrogated by prior treatment with anti-CD43 S7 mAb (18Todeschini A.R. Nunes M.P. Pires R.S. Lopes M.F. Previato J.O. Mendonça-Previato L. DosReis G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5192-5198Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To prove that CD43 is the counterreceptor for TS on CD4+ T cells, we investigated the interaction between irTS and the leukosialin (CD43), using splenic CD4+ T cells from CD43-deficient mice (CD43−/−). As compared with wild type, CD4+ T cells from CD43−/− mice failed to bind either anti-CD43 mAb S7 (Fig. 1 A) or biotin-conjugated irTS (Fig. 1 B). To confirm that CD43 is the counterreceptor for irTS, CD4+ T cell extracts from wild-type and CD43−/− mice were immunoprecipitated with biotin-conjugated irTS or with anti-CD43 mAb S7. Precipitates were immunoblotted and revealed with anti-CD43 mAb S7 (Fig. 1 C). Remarkably, both irTS and anti-CD43 mAb S7 immunoprecipitated the same 115-kDa protein band expected for CD43 (19Jones A.T. Federsppiel B. Ellies L.G. Williams M.J. Burgener R. Duronio V. Smith C.A. Takei F. Ziltener H.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 3426-3439PubMed Google Scholar). However, this protein was absent when CD4+ T cells from CD43−/− mice were submitted to the same treatment (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that CD43 expression is required for irTS binding on T cells, showing that soluble irTS physically interacts with CD43. CD43 is the most abundant glycoprotein bearing α2–3- and α2–6-linked sialic acids expressed on the surface of T cells (26Ostberg J.R. Barth R.K. Frelinger J.G. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 546-550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To investigate whether sialic acid is the epitope for irTS, T cells were treated with C. perfringens sialidase, and the binding of biotinylated irTS was tested. Fig.2 A (a) shows that irTS binds to T cells, and this binding is abrogated by sialidase treatment (Fig. 2 A (b)). irTS binding was reconstituted with high intensity by resialylation of T cells with rTS in the presence of α2–3-SL as donor substrate (Fig. 2 A(c)). Since TS catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid residues from NeuAcα2–3Galpβ1-x-containing donors and attaches them in an α2–3 linkage to terminal βGalp-containing molecules (9Vandekerckhove F. Schenkman S. Pontes de Carvalho L. Tomlinson S. Kiso M. Yoshida M. Hasegawa A. Nussenzweig V. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), our results clearly show that irTS binds α2–3-linked sialic acid. The specificity of the interaction of irTS with α2–3-linked sialic acid was confirmed by inhibition studies using α2–3- (Fig. 2 A (d)) or α2–6-SL (Fig. 2 A (e)). As shown in Fig.2 A (d), binding of irTS to T cells was abrogated by the previous incubation of irTS with α2–3-SL but not with α2–6-SL (Fig. 2 A (e)). These results are consistent with the irTS bright pattern of staining observed after resialylation of T cells by rTS (Fig. 2 A (c)) since these cells now must bear almost exclusively α2–3-linked sialic acid. In addition, previous treatment of irTS with α2–3-SL completely disrupt irTS binding to resialylated T cells (Fig.2 A (f)). This inhibition was dose-dependent and had an IC50 of 0.49 mm (Fig. 2 B). The irTS preference for α2–3-linked sialic acid was further investigated using sialylated PAA probes. Fig.3 shows that irTS strongly binds to α2–3-linked sialic acid. Binding was dependent on the concentration of α2–3-SL-PAA, being maximal at 10 μg/ml, and relies on the carboxylate group of sialic acid since irTS binding is abrogated after carboxyl reduction (Fig. 3). Furthermore, when α2–6-SL- or SLeX-PAA probes were used as ligands, low level binding or no binding to irTS was observed, respectively (Fig. 4).Figure 4Binding of irTS to sialylated PAA probes. Sialylated PAA probes conjugated to α2–3-SL, α2–6-SL, or SleX were either untreated or treated with periodate and added to immobilized irTS in the presence or absence of anti-TS (antibodies against the TS catalytic site). Binding was tested by ELISA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data show the mean ± S.D. of duplicates. Black column, PAA sham-treated; White column, PAA mild periodate-treated;Gray column, PAA + anti-TS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Periodate treatment of sialylated PAA probes did not reduce irTS binding (Fig. 4), demonstrating that the sialic acid side chain is not required for irTS recognition. Taken together, these data suggest that irTS displays a binding site that recognizes α2–3-linked sialic acid and its 7-carbon analog and that this binding can be abolished by either fucosylation or carboxyl reduction. Interactions of irTS with all sialylated PAA probes were inhibited in the presence of a polyclonal antibody directed against epitopes present in the catalytic domain of the active TS (Fig. 4) (25Costa F. Franchin G. Pereira-Chioccola V.L. Ribeirão M. Schenkman S. Rodrigues M.M. Vaccine. 1998; 16: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To better understand the binding specificity observed for irTS, NMR spectroscopy studies were employed. Saturation transfer difference (STD) experiments were used to verify soluble α2–3-SL interaction with irTS. The binding assay was done in the presence of the methyl α-mannoside, used as negative control. Fig.5 shows the one-dimensional STD experiment of irTS in the presence of α2–3-SL and methyl α-mannoside in D2O PBS, pH 7.6, at 20 °C. Binding of α2–3-SL can be followed by measuring the signal at 2.050 ppm assigned to the 5NAc protons of N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) (27Reuter G. Schauer R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 168-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and by the NeuAc H3 equatorial (eq) and axial (ax) resonances at 2.727 and 1.812 ppm, respectively. Binding of methy α-mannoside would be detected by observation of the H1 and methyl protons at 4.775 and 3.405 ppm, respectively, in the STD spectrum. The subtraction of the spectrum in which protein resonance was presaturated (0.5 ppm) (Fig. 5 B) from the reference spectrum without protein saturation (Fig. 5 A) reveals the resonances at 2.727, 2.050, and 1.812 ppm (Fig. 5 C) of NeuAc from α2–3-SL ligand involved in the binding to the protein. No signals arising from methyl α-mannoside were observed, showing that α2–3-SL binds to irTS in a specific interaction. irTS interaction with α2–3-SL was further verified by two-dimensional NMR experiments, which show in detail the key structural elements of α2–3-SL involved in binding to irTS. A reference TOCSY spectrum of irTS in the presence of α2–3-SL and methyl α-mannoside was recorded without protein presaturation and with protein presaturation (0.5 ppm) (Fig.6 A). In the STD-TOCSY obtained (Fig. 6 B), the on-diagonal cross-peaks identify hydrogens in close proximity with the protein in the complex. It is evident that α2–3-SL binds to irTS. As the relative signal intensities on the STD spectrum correlate with the proximity to the protein, we can conclude that NAc and the H3ax protons from the NeuAc are in close contact with irTS. In the STD-TOCSY spectrum, off-diagonal cross-peaks help identify key hydrogens involved in binding. It is clear that the H3eq, H4, and H5 from the NeuAc residue and the H1, H3 and H4 from the βGalp ring also interact with the irTS as they receive saturation from the protein (Fig. 6 B). The H1 and H2 peaks from the α-anomer of Glcp are low in intensity, indicating a loose contact with the irTS binding site. Cross-peaks arising from α-Glcp or from meth"

To investigate whether E2 proteins encoded by high risk HPVs may function differentially from E2 proteins encoded by low risk HPVs and animal papillomaviruses, we conducted comparative DNA-binding and transcription studies using electrophoretic mobility shift assays and cell-free transcription systems reconstituted with purified general transcription factors, cofactor, RNA polymerase II, and with E2 proteins encoded by HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-11, and bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1). We found that although different types of E2 proteins all exhibited transactivation and repression activities, depending on the sequence context of the E2-binding sites, HPV-16 E2 shows stronger transcription activity and greater DNA-binding affinity than those displayed by the other E2 proteins. Surprisingly, HPV-18 E2 behaves more similarly to BPV-1 E2 than HPV-16 E2 in its functional properties. Our studies thus categorize HPV-18 E2 and BPV-1 E2 in the same protein family, a finding consistent with the available E2 structural data that separate the closely related HPV-16 and HPV-18 E2 proteins but classify together the more divergent BPV-1 and HPV-18 E2 proteins.

So far, more than 100 HPV types have been identified and fully sequenced, whereas more than 120 putative novel types have been partially characterized (1zur Hausen H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 690-698Google Scholar, 2Dell G. Gaston K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1923-1942Google Scholar). HPV types frequently found in invasive cancers include HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -35, -39, -45, -51, -52, -58, and -59. These are classified as high risk HPVs. In contrast, HPV types that are rarely found in cancers but are associated with genital warts, such as HPV-6 and HPV-11, are considered low risk HPVs (1zur Hausen H. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 690-698Google Scholar, 2Dell G. Gaston K. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1923-1942Google Scholar, 3Muñoz N. J. Clin. Virol. 2000; 19: 1-5Google Scholar). Because the genomic structures of HPVs are highly conserved, it is important to determine the functional differences among individual HPV gene products which lead to etiologically high and low risk phenotypes. Previous comparative studies have primarily focused on HPV-encoded E6- and E7-transforming proteins. These studies found that E6 and E7, from high risk HPVs, lead to cellular transformation much more readily than low risk E6 and E7 proteins (for review, see Refs. 4Mantovani F. Banks L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7874-7887Google Scholar and 5Münger K. Basile J.R. Duensing S. Eichten A. Gonzalez S.L. Grace M. Zacny V.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7888-7898Google Scholar). In both high and low risk HPVs, expression of E6 and E7 is transcriptionally regulated via the E6 promoter by many cellular and viral proteins. The full-length viral E2 protein is a sequence-specific transcription factor that functions as an activator or repressor to regulate tightly the E6 promoter through four consensus E2-binding sites (E2-BSs), ACCGN4CGGT (6O'Connor M.

Efficient activation of the E6 promoter requires binding of E2 protein to the promoter-distal E2-BSs in conjunction with binding of cellular factors to the enhancer elements also located within the URR (8Chong T. Apt D. Gloss B. Isa M. Bernard H.-U. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5933-5943Google Scholar, 9Dong G. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1115-1127Google Scholar, 10Tan S.-H. Leong L.E.-C. Walker P.A.

Virol. 1994; 68: 6655-6666Google Scholar). Activation directly mediated through E2 protein may occur via different mechanisms. First, E2 may recruit the general transcription machinery to the promoter through direct interactions with TATA-binding protein (TBP), TBP-associated factors in TFIID, TFIIB, as well as RNA polymerase II (12Rank N.M. Lambert P.F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6323-6334Google Scholar, 13Steger G. Ham J. Lefebvre O. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 329-340Google Scholar, 14Benson J.D. Lawande R. Howley P.M. J.

Second, E2 interacts with nuclear factors Sp1, Gps2/AMF-1, or TopBP1, which may then serve as coregulators for transcription (18Li R. Knight J.D. Jackson S.P. Tjian R. Botchan M.R. Cell. 1991; 65: 493-505Google Scholar, 19Breiding D.E. Sverdrup F. Grossel M. Moscufo N. Boonchai W. Androphy E.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 7208-7219Google Scholar, 20Boner W. Taylor E.R. Tsirimonaki E. Yamane K. Campo M.S. Morgan I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22297-22303Google Scholar). Third, E2 may potentiate transcription by remodeling DNA structure at the chromatin level (21Lefebvre O. Steger G. Yaniv M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 465-478Google Scholar). Indeed, studies have shown E2 interacts with proteins (CREB-binding protein, p300, and p300/CBP-associated factor) possessing histone acetyltransferase activity (22Peng Y.-C. Breiding D.E. Sverdrup F. Richard J. Androphy E.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 5872-5879Google Scholar, 23Lee D. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.W. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7045-7051Google Scholar, 24Lee D. Hwang S.G. Kim J. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6483-6489Google Scholar). It is likely that different types of E2 proteins function differentially in regulating preinitiation complex assembly and show varied cooperativity with cellular enhancer-binding factors that recognize constitutive, inducible, or cell type-specific enhancer elements located in the URR, as well as with general or gene-specific transcription cofactors that modulate E2 activity on HPV chromatin. Although low levels of E2 occupy promoter-distal binding sites, it is postulated that transcriptional repression occurs with high levels of E2 leading to occupancy at promoter-proximal E2-BSs thus displacing cellular factors critical for E6 promoter activity (9Dong G. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1115-1127Google Scholar, 10Tan S.-H. Leong L.E.-C. Walker P.A. Bernard H.-U. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6411-6420Google Scholar, 25Dostatni N. Lambert P.F. Sousa R.

Virol. 1996; 70: 119-126Google Scholar). We have shown previously that E2 protein can also actively repress transcription by preventing preinitiation complex formation (28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar). This active repression was demonstrated to be independent of cellular enhancer-binding factors, Sp1, and general cofactors such as TBP-associated factors, TFIIA, mediator and PC4 (28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar). Conversely, cellular proteins may bind to DNA and hinder access of E2 protein, thus inhibiting E2 function (29Jackson M.E. Campo M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6038-6046Google Scholar, 30Boeckle S. Pfister H. Steger G. Virology. 2002; 293: 103-117Google Scholar, 31Hartley K.A. Alexander K.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5014-5023Google Scholar). Papillomaviruses may also use its own proteins to modulate E2 activation function. These include various forms of E2 repressor proteins created through alternative splicing to generate gene products that contain the same DNA-binding domain linked to different N-terminal regions (32Chiang C.-M. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3317-3329Google Scholar, 33Stubenrauch F. Hummel M. Iftner T. Laimins L.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1178-1186Google Scholar, 34Stubenrauch F. Zobel T. Iftner T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 4139-4149Google Scholar) or the use of viral E1 protein to abrogate E2 transactivation function through direct protein-protein interaction (35Sandler A.B. Vande Pol S.B. Spalholz B.A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5079-5087Google Scholar, 36Ferran M.C. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 796-801Google Scholar). Because E2 only weakly activates (∼2-fold) but strongly represses (up to 100-fold) the native HPV promoter in both transfected cells (9Dong G. Broker T.R. Chow L.T. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1115-1127Google Scholar) and in currently available cell-free transcription systems (for review, see Ref. 28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar), our initial effort was focused on dissecting the mechanisms of transcriptional repression by various E2 proteins on their homologous E6 promoter (28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar). Interaction between viral E1 and E2 proteins also regulates papillomavirus DNA replication and viral episome maintenance (37Mohr I.J. Clark R. Sun S. Androphy E.J. MacPherson P. Botchan M.R. Science. 1990; 250: 1694-1699Google Scholar, 38Ustav M. Stenlund A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 449-457Google Scholar, 39Frattini M.G. Laimins L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to binding to viral DNA, E2 ensures proper segregation of viral genomes during cellular replication which is independent of the E2 DNA-binding domain (41Lehman C.W. Botchan M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4338-4343Google Scholar, 42Skiadopoulos M.H. McBride A.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2079-2088Google Scholar, 43Ilves I. Kivi S. Ustav M. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 4404-4412Google Scholar). Analogous to abrogation of E2 transactivation function, it has been suggested that E1 also regulates E2 binding to mitotic chromosomes (44Voitenleitner C. Botchan M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3440-3451Google Scholar). Besides regulating viral transcription, replication, and viral episome maintenance, E2 has been implicated in several cellular processes relevant to carcinogenesis. E2 transfected into HPV DNA-containing cell lines can lead to growth arrest, apoptosis, or abrogation of mitotic checkpoints (45Hwang E.S. Riese Jr., D.J. Settleman J. Nilson L.A. Honig J. Flynn S. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3720-3729Google Scholar, 46Desaintes C. Demeret C. Goyat S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 504-514Google Scholar, 47Frattini M.G. Hurst S.D. Lim H.B. Swaminathan S. Laimins L.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 318-331Google Scholar). E2 repression of E6 and E7 oncogene expression leading to reactivation of p53 and pRb tumor suppressor pathways has been the proposed mechanism for growth arrest in HPV-positive cell lines (48Wells S.I. Francis D.A. Karpova A.Y. Dowhanick J.J. Benson J.D. Howley P.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5762-5771Google Scholar, 49Goodwin E.C. DiMaio D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12513-12518Google Scholar). Surprisingly, growth arrest and repression of E6 and E7 expression require an intact E2 transactivation domain (50Dowhanick J.J. McBride A.A. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7791-7799Google Scholar, 51Goodwin E.C. Naeger L.K. Breiding D.E. Androphy E.J. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3925-3934Google Scholar, 52Francis D.A. Schmid S.I. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2679-2686Google Scholar). Expression of E2 protein in a transformed cell line devoid of HPV DNA also displayed growth arrest through an undefined mechanism (45Hwang E.S. Riese Jr., D.J. Settleman J. Nilson L.A. Honig J. Flynn S. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3720-3729Google Scholar, 51Goodwin E.C. Naeger L.K. Breiding D.E. Androphy E.J. DiMaio D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3925-3934Google Scholar). E2-triggered apoptosis can occur through both p53-independent (53Desaintes C. Goyat S. Garbay S. Yaniv M. Thierry F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4538-4545Google Scholar) and p53-dependent pathways (54Webster K. Parish J. Pandya M. Stern P.L. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 87-94Google Scholar). Similar to E2-induced growth arrest, E2 caused apoptosis in HPV-negative cell lines through unknown pathways (54Webster K. Parish J. Pandya M. Stern P.L. Clarke A.R. Gaston K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 87-94Google Scholar). Although many functions have been attributed to papillomaviral E2 proteins, very few studies have been conducted to compare directly the transcription activities among HPV and BPV-1 E2 proteins (11Ushikai M. Lace M.J. Yamakawa Y. Kono M. Anson J. Ishiji T. Parkkinen S. Wicker N. Valentine M.-E. Davidson I. Turek L.P. Haugen T.H. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6655-6666Google Scholar, 55Bouvard V. Story A. Pim D. Banks L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5451-5459Google Scholar, 56Kovelman R. Bilter G.K. Glezer E. Tsou A.Y. Barbosa M.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7549-7560Google Scholar). Experiments directly comparing high risk HPV-16 and HPV-18 E2 proteins with low risk HPV-6 E2 protein by transient transfection assays found that high risk E2 proteins have higher activation activities than low risk E2 protein, but this activity did not correlate with either higher steady-state levels of protein in vivo or with DNA-binding properties of the two classes of E2 proteins (56Kovelman R. Bilter G.K. Glezer E. Tsou A.Y. Barbosa M.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7549-7560Google Scholar). Therefore, it was hypothesized that high risk E2 proteins were intrinsically better transcriptional activators than low risk E2 proteins, which in turn regulate the levels of E6 and E7 oncoproteins in transformed cells and thereby control the processes leading to carcinogenesis. In a more recent study, high risk E2 was found to have higher affinity for transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein than that of low risk E2 (23Lee D. Lee B. Kim J. Kim D.W. Choe J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7045-7051Google Scholar). These studies on E2 transcriptional activity were assayed primarily in transiently transfected cells. Therefore, interpretation of the results may be complicated by interference of other cellular factors, potentially masking the true activity of E2 protein. To address the differences in transcriptional activities between high and low risk HPV E2 proteins, we employed in vitrotranscription systems reconstituted either with individually purified recombinant general transcription factors (TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIF), epitope-tagged protein complexes (TFIID, TFIIH, and pol II) and general cofactor PC4, or with a preassembled RNA polymerase II (pol II) holoenzyme complex and TBP (17Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34235-34243Google Scholar, 28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar). Using this highly purifiedin vitro transcription system along with an HPV responsive G-less cassette template containing two E2-BSs (17Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34235-34243Google Scholar), high risk HPV-16 E2 protein was found to possess greater transactivation activity than those exhibited by E2 proteins encoded by HPV-18, HPV-11, and BPV-1. For repression assays, we employed an in vitro transcription system reconstituted with pol II holoenzyme and TBP with HPV template containing either homologous or heterologous URR linked to a G-less cassette. HPV-16 E2 (16E2) was determined to be the strongest transcriptional repressor, followed by BPV-1 E2 (BE2), HPV-18 E2 (18E2) and HPV-11 E2 (11E2). The transcriptional activities of these E2 proteins correlated well with their corresponding binding affinities to E2-BSs derived from the promoter-proximal regions of naturally occurring HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV 18 E6 promoters, as well as BPV-1. Although previous in vivo studies revealed little correlation between E2 transcriptional activities and DNA-binding affinities, our in vitro studies indicate that higher transcriptional activation and repression activities of various E2 proteins correlate directly with their relative DNA-binding affinities for E2-BSs. Bacterial expression plasmids pF:E2-11d (28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar), pF:16E2-11d, pF:18E2-11d, and p:BE2-11d were used to express HPV-11, HPV-16, HPV-18, and BPV-1 E2 proteins, respectively. The plasmid pF:16E2-11d was constructed by cloning the HPV-16 E2 open reading frame, generated by PCR amplification using pCMV-16E2 (56Kovelman R. Bilter G.K. Glezer E. Tsou A.Y. Barbosa M.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7549-7560Google Scholar) as template with an NdeI site-containing sense primer (5′-AAGTCGACATATGGAGACTCTTTGCCAA-3′) and a BamHI site-containing antisense primer (5′-AACTCGAGGATCCTCATATAGACATAAATCC-3′), into pF:E4-11d (28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar), after swapping the inserts between NdeI and BamHI sites. The plasmid pF:18E2-11d was created similarly by using pCMV-18E2 (56Kovelman R. Bilter G.K. Glezer E. Tsou A.Y. Barbosa M.S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7549-7560Google Scholar) as template with sense primer (5′-AAGTCGACATATGCAGACACCGAAGGAAA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-AACTCGAGGATCCTTACATTGTCATGTATCCC-3′) for PCR amplification. Likewise, the plasmid pF:BE2-11d was cloned using pdBPV-1(142–6) (57Sarver N. Byrne J.C. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 7147-7151Google Scholar) as template with sense primer (5′-AAGTCGACATATGGAGACAGCATGCGAA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-TTCTCGAGGATCCTATTGATGCAAGC-3′). The G-less cassette template p18URR-GLess, containing the HPV-18 URR spanning nucleotides 6929–7857/1–81, used for in vitrotranscription was constructed by cloning the PCR product, generated from genomic HPV-18 DNA (gift from L. T. Chow) using anEcoRI site-containing sense primer (5′-CTGGGTACCGAATTCGGATCCCTATGATAAG-3′) and an SacI site-containing antisense primer (5′-CTGAGATCTGAGCTCTTTTATATACACCG-3′) into the EcoRI-SacI-linearized G-less cassette vector pGL (58Wang J.C. Sawadogo M. Van Dyke M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1397: 141-145Google Scholar). The p16URR-GLess G-less cassette template, spanning HPV-16 URR nucleotides 7007–7904/1–72, was constructed similarly by cloning the PCR product generated from genomic HPV-16 DNA (gift from P. M. Howley) using sense primer (5′-CTGGGTACCGAATTCAGACCTAGATCAGTTTC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CTGAGATCTGAGCTCTTTTATACTAACCG-3′) into pGL. The other transcription templates, p11URR-GLess (originally named p7072–70GLess/I−, see Ref. 28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell.

Bacterially expressed FLAG-tagged HPV-11 E2, HPV-16 E2, HPV-18 E2, and BPV-1 E2 were purified from BL21(DE3)pLysS strain harboring pF:E2-11d, pF:16E2-11d, pF:18E2-11d, and pF:BE2-11d, respectively, according to the protocol published previously (17Wu S.-Y.

Isolation of recombinant FLAG-tagged human general transcription factors (TFIIB, TBP, TFIIEα, and TFIIEβ), FLAG-tagged multiprotein complexes (TFIID, TFIIH, and pol II), six histidine-tagged TFIIF subunits (RAP30 and RAP74), recombinant PC4, and TFIID-deficient pol II holoenzyme was conducted as described previously (17Wu S.-Y.

The transcription repression assays were performed in a two-component transcription system reconstituted with TFIID-deficient pol II holoenzyme and TBP using 50 ng of p11URR-GLess, p16URR-GLess, p18URR-GLess, or p7862–70(23M)GLess/I− G-less cassette template, 50 ng of pMLΔ53, 1 ng of TBP, and 3 μl (∼ 90 ng) of pol II holoenzyme, in the absence or presence of 11E2, 16E2, 18E2, or BE2 protein as specified in the figures. Reactions were then conducted and analyzed as described previously (28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar, 60Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J.

The E2 transactivation assay was carried out in a highly purifiedin vitro transcription system in a 30-μl reaction containing 50 ng of pG5MLT, 50 ng of p2E2(IR)Δ53, 10 ng of TFIIB, 20 ng of TFIID, 2.5 ng each of TFIIEα and TFIIEβ, 2 ng of TFIIF, 22.5 ng of TFIIH, and 5 ng of pol II, in the presence or absence of 150 ng of PC4 and an increasing amount of 11E2, 16E2, 18E2, or BE2 as specified, following the two-step incubation protocol (17Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34235-34243Google Scholar). Reactions were then performed and analyzed as described previously (17Wu S.-Y. Chiang C.-M. J. Biol.

Transcription signals were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). DNA probes used for EMSA were generated by PCR amplification of respective HPV E6 promoter-proximal fragments and BPV-1 URR. The HPV-11 E6 promoter-proximal fragments, HPV-11(7902–92), HPV-11(7902–92)3M, HPV-11(7902–92)4M, and HPV-11(7902–92)34M, which span HPV-11 nucleotides 7902–7933/1–92 containing wild-type 3 and 4, mutated 3, mutated 4, or mutated 3 and 4 E2-BSs, were created by PCR amplification using sense primer (5′-AACCCGGGTACCTACCCACACCCTACATA-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GGACACAGATCTGAGCTCTGCTAATTTTTTGGG-3′) with DNA templates pGL7072–161, p24-N-3M, p24-N-4M, and p24-N-34M (9Dong G.

The wild-type HPV-16 E6 promoter-proximal DNA fragment HPV-16(7868–96), spanning HPV-16 nucleotides 7868–7904/1–96 and containing two wild-type E2-BSs, was generated by PCR amplification of HPV-16 genomic DNA (gift from P.

The wild-type HPV-18 E6 promoter-proximal DNA fragment HPV-18(7834–101), spanning HPV-18 nucleotides 7834–7857/1–101 and containing two wild-type E2-BSs, was generated by PCR amplification of HPV-18 genomic DNA (gift from L. T. Chow) using sense primer (5′-CTGGGTACCGAATTCTGGGCAGCACATACTAT-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GGACACAGATCTGAGCTCATTGTGGTGTGTTTCTC-3′). The BPV-1 DNA fragment BPV-1(7874–85), spanning BPV-1 nucleotides 7874–7945/1–85 (numbering based on GenBank accession number NC_001522) and containing two wild-type E2-BSs, was generated by PCR amplification using pdBPV-1(142–6) as template (57Sarver N.

These PCR-amplified DNA fragments were then purified by gel electrophoresis using a 2% agarose gel and used for end-labeling reactions with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. DNA probes were purified further by NICK column (Amersham Biosciences). EMSA was conducted in a 10-μl reaction containing ∼0.5 fmol of32P-labeled DNA probe in the presence of 10 mmHEPES-Na (pH 7.9), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and increasing amounts of respective purified E2 proteins (adjusted to 2 μl in BC300). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and run at 175 V for ∼2.5 h at 4 °C. The gels were then dried and exposed to x-ray films. The signals were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. The intensity of the remaining probe in each lane after EMSA was quantified using ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) without (θ) or with (ε for each lane) an increasing amount of 11E2, 16E2, 18E2, or BE2 protein. Fractional occupancy (ψ) was then determined by Equation 1. ψ=100%(1−[ε/θ])(Eq. 1) Binding isotherms were obtained by plotting fractional occupancy as a function of protein concentrations and analyzed by nonlinear least squares analyses. The equilibrium binding constant,Kd, was determined by analysis of the titration curves against Equation 2,ψ=[protein]/([protein]+Kd)(Eq. 2) where ψ = fractional occupancy, [protein] = protein concentration, and Kd = the equilibrium binding constant (62Nelson D.L. Cox M.M. Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry. 3rd Ed. Worth Publishers, New York2000: 203-242Google Scholar). To compare the transcriptional activities between high risk (HPV-16 and HPV-18) and low risk (HPV-11) HPV and animal papillomavirus E2 proteins, we first expressed full-length HPV-11, HPV-16, HPV-18, and BPV-1 E2 proteins in bacteria. All E2 proteins share similar structural features with an N-terminal activation domain linked to a C-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain by a flexible hinge region (Fig.1 A). These bacterially expressed E2 proteins were purified to near homogeneity and clearly migrated at positions corresponding to their predicted molecular sizes (Fig. 1 B). The amounts of various purified E2 proteins were then normalized by Western blotting with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the same epitope sequence introduced at the N terminus of individual E2 proteins (data not shown). For functional studies, we also created three transcription templates, containing enhancer elements and the E6 promoter derived from each type of HPV, by cloning respective URR into a G-less cassette of 377 nucleotides (Fig.1 C). We demonstrated previously that correct initiation from the HPV E6 promoter whose transcription is regulated by different amounts of E2 proteins, similar to the in vivo observations, was recapitulated in our cell-free transcription systems using the G-less cassette templates (28Hou S.Y. Wu S.-Y. Zhou T. Thomas M.C. Chiang C.-M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 113-125Google Scholar). When examined in a cell-free transcription system reconstituted with TBP and human pol II holoenzyme, which provides pol II and general transcription factors TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH (60Wu S.-Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 23480-23490Google Scholar), transcription from these URR-driven G-less templates was inhibited by BE2, 11E2, 16E2, and 18E2, in a dose-dependent manner"
https://openalex.org/W1997222309,"We showed previously that decreased extracellular salt or chloride up-regulates the cortical thick ascending limb of Henle (cTALH) COX-2 expression via a p38-dependent pathway. The present studies determined that low salt medium increased COX-2 mRNA expression 3.9-fold control by 6 h in cultured cTALH, which was blocked by actinomycin D pretreatment, suggesting transcriptional regulation. Luciferase activity (normalized to β-galactosidase activity) of the full-length (−3400) COX-2 promoter in cTALH increased from 1.8 ± 0.3 in control media to 5.8 ± 0.7 in low salt (n = 9;p < 0.01). Low chloride medium had similar effects as low salt has on COX-2 promoter activity. Deletion constructs −815, −512, and −410 were similarly stimulated, but −385 could not be stimulated significantly by low salt (1.8 ± 0.3versus 2.4 ± 0.5, n = 10). This suggested involvement of an NF-κB cis-element located in this region, which was confirmed by utilizing a construct with a point mutation of this NF-κB-binding site that was not stimulated by low salt medium. Co-incubation of the specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580 or PD169316, inhibited a low salt-induced increase in luciferase activity of the intact COX-2 promoter (5.8 ± 0.7versus 1.1 ± 0.2, n = 8 and 1.4 ± 0.4, n = 4 respectively, p < 0.01). Mobility shift assays indicated that the low salt medium stimulated NF-κB binding activity, and this stimulation was inhibited by p38 inhibitors. To test whether p38 also increased COX-2 expression by increasing mRNA stability, cTALH were incubated in low salt for 2 h, and actinomycin was then added with or without SB203580. p38 inhibition led to a decreased half-life of COX-2 mRNA (from 68 to 18 min, n = 4–7, p < 0.05). Therefore, these studies indicate that p38 stimulates COX-2 expression in cTALH and macula densa by transcriptional regulation predominantly via a NF-κB-dependent pathway and by post-transcriptional increases in mRNA stability. We showed previously that decreased extracellular salt or chloride up-regulates the cortical thick ascending limb of Henle (cTALH) COX-2 expression via a p38-dependent pathway.

Prostaglandins are metabolized from arachidonic acid through cyclooxygenase (COX)-dependent 1The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; cTALH, cortical thick ascending limb of Henle; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein.pathways (1Needleman P. Turk J. Jakschik B.A. Morrison A.R. Lefkowith J.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 69-102Google Scholar) and modulate vascular tone, expression and secretion of renin, and salt and water homeostasis in the mammalian kidney. Two isoforms of COX have been found: COX-1, which is constitutive, and COX-2, which is inflammation-mediated and glucocorticoid-sensitive (2Masferrer J.L. Zweifel B.S. Seibert K. Needleman P. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1375-1379Google Scholar, 3Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12866-12872Google Scholar, 4O'Banion M.K. Winn V.D. Young D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4888-4892Google Scholar). We originally reported that salt restriction increases renal cortical COX-2 expression selectively in tubular epithelial cells of macula densa and the surrounding cortical thick ascending limb of Henle (cTALH) (5Harris R.C. McKanna J.A. Akai Y. Jacobson H.R. Dubois R.N. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2504-2510Google Scholar), which was confirmed by subsequent studies (6Jensen B.L. Kurtz A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1242-1249Google Scholar). The macula densa is recognized to be important for regulation of renal renin expression and regulation of afferent renal arteriolar tone through the process of tubuloglomerular feedback (7Schnermann J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R263-R279Google Scholar). Up-regulation of COX-2 in these cells was also found in other high renin states, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (8Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. Miyazaki Y. Ichikawa I. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 953-961Google Scholar, 9Wolf K. Castrop H. Hartner A. Goppelt-Strube M. Hilgers K.F. Kurtz A. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 503-507Google Scholar), diuretic administration (10Mann B. Hartner A. Jensen B.L. Kammerl M. Kramer B.K. Kurtz A. Kidney Int. 2001; 59: 62-68Google Scholar), and experimental renovascular hypertension (11Wang J.L. Cheng H.F. Harris R.C. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 96-101Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that COX-2 is an important mediator for renin release from macula densa (8Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. Miyazaki Y. Ichikawa I. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 953-961Google Scholar, 12Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. Wang S.W. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F449-F456Google Scholar). It has been suggested that decreased intraluminal chloride concentration is the signal for macula densa stimulation of renin secretion (13Lorenz J.N. Weihprecht H. Schnermann J. Skott O. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F186-F193Google Scholar, 14Persson A.E. Salomonsson M. Westerlund P. Greger R. Schlatter E. Gonzalez E. Kidney Int. 1991; 32 (suppl.): 39-44Google Scholar). Ion substitution experiments in perfusion of isolated cortical thick ascending limbs with associated juxtaglomerular apparati indicated that only when chloride was replaced by alternative anions was renin secretion increased; no increase in renin expression or secretion could be seen in response to sodium substitution by other cations (15Lorenz J.N. Weihprecht H. Schnermann J. Skott O. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F486-F493Google Scholar). Our previous studies indicated that decreased extracellular NaCl or selective decreases in extracellular chloride up-regulated cTALH COX-2 expression, and this up-regulation of COX-2 in cTALH occurred via a p38-dependent pathway (16Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 681-688Google Scholar). The current study investigated the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 by alteration of extracellular salt or chloride. Goat anti-human uromucoid antibody was from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Anti-goat IgG (H+L) was from Vector Laboratory (Burlingame, CA). Anti-p65, -p50, -p52, and -c-Rel antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rat COX-2 cDNA was from Oxford Biomedical Research (Oxford, MI). The luciferase assay system and gel shift assay systems were from Promega (Madison, WI). SB203580, PD169316, and Bay 11–7082 were from Calbiochem Bioscience Inc. (La Jolla, CA). [32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. LipofectAMINE was from Invitrogen. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma. cTALH cells were isolated from homogenates of rabbit renal cortex by immunodissection with anti-Tamm Horsfall antibody, as previously described (8Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. Miyazaki Y. Ichikawa I. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 953-961Google Scholar, 17Allen M.L. Nakao A. Sonnenburg W.K. Burnatowska-Hledin M. Spielman W.S. Smith W.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F704-F710Google Scholar, 18Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F122-F129Google Scholar). Briefly, the renal cortex was dissected, minced, and digested with 0.1% collagenase. After blocking with 10% bovine serum albumin, the sieved homogenates were incubated with goat anti-human Tamm Horsfall antiserum (50 mg/ml) for 30 min on ice, followed by washing and addition to plastic Petri dishes coated with anti-goat IgG (8 mg/ml). Attached cells resistant to washing were dislodged and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle' medium/Ham's F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. The proximal 3.2 kb of the mouse COX-2 promoter was cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse kidney RNA with the 5′ primer (CAT GAA TTC TGT TCT GCC CTC ATG TGT ATG) and the 3′ primer (TAA GGT ACC GGT GGA GCT GGC AGG ATG CAG TGC A) and then subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector (Promega). The −815 and −512 deletion luciferase reporter constructs were a generous gift from Dr. Yamamoto (19Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Google Scholar). The mouse COX-2 promoter was cut withEcoRI and PpuMI, blunted, and self-ligated to make the −385 deletion construct. The XhoI cutting site was introduced by point mutation to produce the −410 deletion construct. NF-κB and CREB point mutants were also constructed (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, the luciferase reporter plasmid containing the mutation for NF-κB or CREB was developed. After PCR amplification, the product was treated with endonuclease DpnI and then transformed to XL 1-Blue supercompetent cells. All of the mutants and other plasmid constructs were verified by sequencing. Primary cultured cTALH cells at 50–60% confluence were transiently transfected with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen). When the cells grew to confluence (48 h later), they were made quiescent with serum-free medium for 16 h and then changed to the indicated condition (e.g.low salt or low chloride medium) for 6 h. The content of low salt or low chloride medium was as previously described (16Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 681-688Google Scholar). The cells were extracted with lysis buffer (luciferase assay system; Promega), and their luciferase activities were measured with a LumiCount Microplate Luminometer (model AL10000; Packard Bioscience Co., Meridian, CT). The results were normalized to β-galactosidase activity as previously described (20Arakawa T. Nakamura M. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 105-110Google Scholar). Primary cultured cTALH cell RNA was extracted by the acid guanidium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method (21Wang J.L. Cheng H.F. Shappell S. Harris R.C. Kidney Int. 2000; 57: 2334-2342Google Scholar). RNA samples were electrophoresed in denatured agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA of rat COX-2. The membranes were then stripped and rehybridized with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Nuclear protein was extracted as previously described (22Zhang X. Huang C.J. Nazarian R. Ritchie T. de Vellis J.S. Noble E.P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 848-850Google Scholar,23Sakai T. Ichiyama T. Whitten C.W. Giesecke A.H. Lipton J.M. Can. J. Anaesth. 2000; 47: 1019-1024Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% leupeptin. 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to make a final concentration of 0.5%, incubated on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged. After washing, the pellet was resuspended in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, I mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% leupeptin with 1/10 volume of 4 m KCl. EMSA was performed as described (24Cheng G. Hagen T.P. Dawson M.L. Barnes K.V. Menick D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12819-12826Google Scholar). Double-stranded NF-κB and CREB oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. 5 μg of nuclear protein was added to the reaction mixture, incubated for 30 min at 25 °C, and resolved on 6% nondenatured polyacrylamide gels. Antibody supershift EMSA was performed by incubating nuclear extracts with anti-p65, -p50, -p52, or -c-Rel antibody or irrelevant control antibody for 10 min at room temperature before adding the labeled probe. Renal cortices were homogenized with RIPA buffer and centrifuged, heated to 100 °C for 5 min with sample buffer, separated on SDS gels under reducing conditions, and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were blocked overnight with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 3% albumin, and 0.5% Tween 20, followed by incubation for 16 h with monoclonal IκB or pIκB antibodies. The second biotinylated antibody reagent was detected using avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) and exposed on film using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). All of the values are presented as the means ± S.E. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni ttests were used for statistical analysis, and the differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. In previous studies we demonstrated that immunoreactive COX-2 protein increased in primary cultured cTALH in response to exposure to low salt or low chloride medium. Substitution of other cations for sodium did not affect COX-2 expression, whereas substitution of other anions for chloride led to increased COX-2 expression (16Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 681-688Google Scholar). In the present studies, we determined that COX-2 mRNA expression increased in low salt medium, with an apparent peaking within 6 h (3.9 ± 0.4-fold control) and increased expression observed for up to 16 h (3.4 ± 0.5-fold control) (Fig.1 A). When cells were preincubated with 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (25Han S.W. Lei Z.M. Rao C.V. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 147: 7-16Google Scholar) for 20 min prior to exposure to low salt medium, increases in COX-2 mRNA expression were blocked (Fig. 1 B). The time course of COX-2 mRNA increase and inhibition by actinomycin D were similar in low chloride medium (not shown). Informative deletions of the murine COX-2 promoter were constructed (Fig. 2 A) and transfected into cTALH cells. After quiescence, the cells were exposed to normal or low salt medium for 6 h, and luciferase activity was measured, normalized by β-galactosidase activity, and expressed as fold control (Fig. 2 B). Luciferase activity of the vector transfected cells was identical if grown in normal medium or low salt medium (1.2 ± 0.1-fold control, n = 14–18, NS). There were no significant differences of luciferase activity among the six groups when grown in normal medium. Low salt medium elevated the luciferase activity of full-length COX-2 promoter-transfected cells (5.2 ± 0.4-fold control, n = 10,p < 0.01). Low salt medium induced similar increases in promoter activity with the −815 construct (5.4 ± 0.6-fold control, n = 17–18, p < 0.01) and the −512 deletion construct (5.6 ± 0.5-fold control in low salt medium, n = 17–18, p < 0.01). However, there was no significant increase in luciferase activity by low salt medium in the −385 deletion construct (1.8 ± 0.2 in normal medium versus 2.4 ± 0.5-fold control in low salt medium, n = 10, NS). Of note, the murine COX-2 promoter contains putative CREB and NF-κB sites between −512 and −385. An additional deletion at −410 removed the putative CREB site but did not interrupt the NF-κB site. Fig. 2 A indicated that the −410 deletion still responded to low salt stimulation (1.6 ± 0.2 in normal medium versus 5.5 ± 0.8-fold control in low salt medium, n = 8,p < 0.01). The NF-κB inhibitor, BAY 11–7082 (10 μm) (26Pierce J.W. Schoenleber R. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S.A. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Google Scholar) also inhibited the low salt medium-induced increase in luciferase activity in the −815 construct (to 2.7 ± 0.6-fold control, n = 8, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3).Figure 3NF-κB and p38 inhibitors block low salt-induced COX-2 promoter activity. cTALH cells were transfected with the −815 COX-2 promoter construct in the absence or presence of the NF-κB inhibitor BAY11–7082 (10 μm) or the p38 inhibitors SB203580 (10 μm) or PD169316 (1 μm) (n = 8). **,p < 0.01. LS, low salt.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm a role for the putative NF-κB site in low salt medium-induced increases in luciferase activity, inactive mutations of the indicated NF-κB and CREB sites were constructed (19Yamamoto K. Arakawa T. Ueda N. Yamamoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). The CREB mutant construct had a significant increase in luciferase activity in response to the low salt medium, although the stimulation was somewhat less than what was observed with the wild type construct. In contrast, the NF-κB mutation completely blocked low salt medium-induced activation (Fig.4 B). Similar responses were seen in the low chloride medium (−815 deletion, from 1.7 ± 0.2- to 4.6 ± 1.0-fold control,n = 4, p < 0.01; NF-κB mutation, from 1.2 ± 0.1- to 1.3 ± 0.3-fold control,n = 4, NS). (Fig. 4 C). In EMSA of cTALH nuclear extracts incubated with a consensus NF-κB oligonucleotide, two specific bands were detected (Fig.5 A). Low salt medium incubation stimulated the NF-κB binding activity (Fig.5 B). CREB binding by nuclear extracts from cTALH cells exposed to low salt medium was also slightly decreased compared with control (Fig. 5 C). Supershift assay indicated that the two bands seen in the NF-κB EMSAs were p65 and p50 (Fig.5 D). Because activation of cytoplasmic NF-κB and translocation to the nucleus is regulated by phosphorylation of IκB, we determined IκB and pIκB expression in cTALH cells. Low salt medium decreased IκB expression (0.4 ± 0.1-fold control, n = 7,p < 0.01) (Fig.6 A) and increased immunoreactive pIκB expression (2.2 ± 0.2-fold control,n = 8, p < 0.05) (Fig.6 B). When a p38-specific inhibitor, PD169316 (1 μm) (16Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 681-688Google Scholar) or SB 203580 (10 μm) (27Leonard M. Ryan M.P. Watson A.J. Schramek H. Healy E. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 1366-1377Google Scholar), was added to low salt or low chloride medium, stimulation of luciferase activity in the −815 construct was decreased (PD169316, from 5.4 ± 0.3- to 1.4 ± 0.4-fold control, n = 6, p < 0.01; SB203580, 1.1 ± 0.2-fold control, n = 8,p < 0.05) (Fig. 3). EMSA further confirmed that SB203580 reduced the increases in NF-κB binding ability (Fig.5 B). SB203580 also inhibited increases in IκB phosphorylation stimulated by low salt (1.4 ± 0.1 of control medium, n = 8, NS) and prevented decreases in IκB levels (0.9 ± 0.1, n = 7, NS) (Fig. 6). In other cell systems, alterations in COX-2 mRNA expression have been attributed to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. To test the possibility that there was a component of post-transcriptional stabilization of COX-2 mRNA in response to low salt or low chloride medium, cTALH cells were stimulated by low salt medium for 2 h, and then actinomycin D was added with or without the specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580. p38 inhibition led to an increased decay rate of COX-2 mRNA (from 68 to 18 min,n = 4–7, p < 0.05) (Fig.7), suggesting that p38 activity may also regulate COX-2 mRNA stability with low salt stimulation. In vivo, dietary salt restriction increases COX-2 expression in the macula densa and the surrounding cTALH cells (5Harris R.C. McKanna J.A. Akai Y. Jacobson H.R. Dubois R.N. Breyer M.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2504-2510Google Scholar, 6Jensen B.L. Kurtz A. Kidney Int. 1997; 52: 1242-1249Google Scholar). Macula densa/cTALH regulate renal renin expression and renal hemodynamics in response to alterations in tubular luminal chloride concentration (15Lorenz J.N. Weihprecht H. Schnermann J. Skott O. Briggs J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: F486-F493Google Scholar). Macula densa sensing of luminal chloride is dependent on net apical transport, mediated by the luminal Na+/K+/2Cl− co-transporter, BSC-1 (28Schlatter E. Salomonsson M. Persson A.E. Greger R. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1989; 414: 286-290Google Scholar, 29Salomonsson M. Gonzalez E. Westerlund P. Persson A.E. Kidney Int. 1991; 32 (suppl.): 51-54Google Scholar, 30Nielsen S. Maunsbach A.B. Ecelbarger C.A. Knepper M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F885-F893Google Scholar). Na+/K+/2Cl−co-transporter has a high affinity for Na+ and K+ but a lower affinity for Cl− (in the 30–50 mmol/l range), resulting in sensitivity to physiologic changes in luminal chloride (31Greger R.

The potential role of prostaglandins in mediation of macula densa function has prompted further studies to investigate the signals mediating this increased COX-2 expression. In our previous studies utilizing primary cultured cTALH cells, we determined that immunoreactive COX-2 expression increased significantly when medium NaCl was decreased without alterations in extracellular osmolality or following administration of the Na+/K+/2Cl− co-transport inhibitor, bumetanide. Selective substitution of chloride led to increased COX-2 expression, whereas selective substitution of sodium had no effect (16Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 681-688Google Scholar). Similarly, it has been reported recently that low chloride stimulates prostaglandin E2 release and COX-2 expression in MMDD1 cells, which are derived from mouse macula densa (32Yang T. Park J.M. Arend L. Huang Y. Topaloglu R. Pasumarthy A. Praetorius H. Spring K. Briggs J.P. Schnermann J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37922-37929Google Scholar). These studies suggested that decreased extracellular [Cl−] initiates the overexpression of COX-2 observedin vivo in response to salt restriction. The present studies indicate that a lessened extracellular chloride-mediated increase in p38 activity stimulates COX-2 expression in cTALH and macula densa by transcriptional regulation via an NF-κB-dependent pathway and by post-transcriptional increases in mRNA stability. In other systems, different members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily have been shown to increase COX-2 expression, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase- (33LaPointe M.C.

Our previous study indicated that activation of p38 occurred in cultured cTALH cells incubated with either low salt or low chloride medium and preceded increases in COX-2 protein expression; the increased COX-2 expression was prevented by specific p38 inhibitors (16Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 681-688Google Scholar). Similar findings were observed in MMDD1 cells (32Yang T. Park J.M. Arend L. Huang Y. Topaloglu R. Pasumarthy A. Praetorius H. Spring K. Briggs J.P. Schnermann J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37922-37929Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo, increased pp38 immunoreactivity was detected in macula densa and cTALH in response to dietary sodium deprivation (16Cheng H.F. Wang J.L. Zhang M.Z. McKanna J.A. Harris R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 681-688Google Scholar). The current study showed that p38 specific inhibitors abolished low salt-induced increase in COX-2 promoter-mediated luciferase p38 inhibition and also led to a decreased half-life of COX-2 mRNA. Therefore, the p38 pathway mediates both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of COX-2 in cTALH induced by low salt/chloride. Transcriptional regulation of COX-2 expression appears to involve diverse mechanisms in different cell types and conditions (41Newton R. Stevens D.A. Hart L.A. Lindsay M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12440-12448Google Scholar), have all been determined to mediate COX-2 expression. In the present studies, the NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11–7082 (26Pierce J.W. Schoenleber R. Jesmok G. Best J. Moore S.A. Collins T. Gerritsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21096-21103Google Scholar) partially reversed increased luciferase activity in response to decreased NaCl or chloride, and selective deletion or mutation of a putative NF-κB binding site in the murine COX-2 promoter completely inhibited NaCl or chloride-mediated stimulation, suggesting a predominant role for NF-κB in the transcriptional regulation. EMSA confirmed stimulated nuclear NF-κB binding activity in response to alterations in extracellular ionic content. Furthermore, the inhibition of NF-κB binding activity by the p38 inhibitor SB203580 indicated that the p38 pathway mediates NF-κB activation. CREB promotes recruitment of the transcriptional co-activator CBP and p300. It has been shown to function as a classic intracellular second messenger in glucose homeostasis, growth factor-dependent cell survival, and involvement in learning and memory (54Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Google Scholar). Although NF-κB activation appears to be absolutely necessary for low salt-mediated increases in COX-2 transcription, our luciferase activity and EMSA data also suggest the possibility of an additional role for CREB. In this regard, in activated macrophages both CREB and NF-κB, as well as C/EBP β and δ, have been identified as key factors in coordinately orchestrating COX-2 transcription (55Caivano M. Gorgoni B. Cohen P. Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48693-48701Google Scholar). NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and RelA/p65 subunits. Its inactive form is found in cytoplasm associated with IκBα and IκBβ. In response to agonist stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated at two critical serine residues by IκB kinase and degraded, resulting in the release of NF-κB, which translocates to the nucleus to activate transcription of responsive genes (56DiDonato J.A. Mercurio F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311Google Scholar, 57Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Google Scholar, 58Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A.

Although some previous studies in other systems had not found that p38 mediated NF-κB nuclear translocation (62Varghese J. Chattopadhaya S. Sarin A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6570-6577Google Scholar, 63Goebeler M. Gillitzer R. Kilian K. Utzel K. Brocker E.B. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Blood. 2001; 97: 46-55Google Scholar), recent studies have suggested such an interaction (64Schulze-Osthoff K. Ferrari D. Riehemann K. Wesselborg S. Immunobiology. 1997; 198: 35-49Google Scholar, 65Ingram A.J. James L. Thai K. Ly H. Cai L. Scholey J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F243-F251Google Scholar). In the present studies, increased levels of phosphorylated IκB and decreases in level of immunoreactive IκB, both of which were inhibited by p38 inhibitors, suggested that decreased medium NaCl or chloride activated IκB phosphorylation in cTALH through a p38-dependent pathway. In addition to the transcriptional induction of COX-2, stabilization of the COX-2 mRNA at the post-transcriptional level is important for maximal expression (66Jang B.C. Sanchez T. Schaefers H.J.

A crucial role for AU-rich sequence elements in the COX-2 3′-untranslated region to stabilize COX-2 mRNA expression has been shown in human lung fibroblast cells (66Jang B.C. Sanchez T.

Biol. 2001; 21: 721-730Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to determine whether p38 activation by decreased extracellular chloride increases COX-2 mRNA stability by a similar mechanism. In summary, these studies indicate that p38 stimulates COX-2 expression in cultured cTALH by transcriptional regulation predominantly via a NF-κB-dependent pathway and by post-transcriptional increases in mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2058198695,"We have shown previously that the oligomeric endostatin domain of collagen XVIII (NC1) functioned as a motility-inducing factor regulating the extracellular matrix-dependent morphogenesis of endothelial cells. This motogenic activity gave rise to structures resembling filipodia and lamellipodia and was dependent on Rac, Cdc42, and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Here, we demonstrate that these properties of endostatin are primarily mediated by laminin in the basement membrane and heparan sulfates on the cell surface. The sites of interaction between laminin and oligomeric endostain include the N-terminal regions of all three laminin chains (amino acids 204–1243 of the α chain, 932–1161 of the β chain, and 150–965 of the γ chain). A monoclonal antibody that blocks the interactions between endostatin and laminin was utilized to inhibit the motogenic activity of endostatin. In parallel, we have engineered selective point mutations and produced recombinant forms that lack binding to heparan sulfates on the cell surface. Our data are consistent with a model of endostatin with two binding sites: one mainly to laminin in the basement membrane and the other to heparan sulfates on the cell surface. The two binding domains on endostatin appear to be separate with the possibility of some overlap between the two sites.

Endostatin, a 183-amino acid proteolytic cleavage fragment corresponding to the C terminus of collagen 18, has been the subject of investigation by a number of laboratories because of its anti-tumor activity and its potential application as an anti-angiogenic cancer therapeutic (1O'Reilly M.S.

Previously, endostatin has demonstrated anti-angiogenic properties in vivo and in vitro(4Bergers G. Javaherian K. Lo K.-M. Folkman J. Hanahan D. Science. 1999; 284: 808-812Google Scholar, 5Sim B.K.L.

Although a number of physical and biochemical properties have been described, the mechanism of endostatin function remains unknown. The crystal structure of both murine and human endostatin have been elucidated and show a noncovalently held dimer at high concentration required for crystallization (6Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Google Scholar, 7Ding Y.-H. Javaherian K. Lo K.-M. Chopra R. Boehm T. Lanciotti J. Harris B.A. Li Y. Shapiro R. Hohenester E. Timpl R. Folkman J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 10443-10448Google Scholar). The presence of two internal disulfide bonds results in a highly folded and compact structure. Endostatin monomer binds one atom of zinc via noncontiguous amino acid residues (7Ding Y.-H. Javaherian K. Lo K.-M. Chopra R. Boehm T. Lanciotti J. Harris B.A. Li Y. Shapiro R. Hohenester E. Timpl R. Folkman J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 10443-10448Google Scholar). The functional importance of zinc binding is yet to be determined. The heparin binding property of endostatin, by which it was originally isolated, is mediated by arginine-rich clusters spread over the three-dimensional globular surface of the protein (6Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Google Scholar, 8Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R.

Understanding the molecular basis of endostatin activity may elucidate the specific biochemical properties that enable its anti-angiogenic function and suppression of tumor growth. Recently, we have demonstrated that the carboxyl end of collagen 18, which features an oligomeric structure, plays an essential role in endothelial migration and morphogenesis in a HUVEC 1The abbreviations used are: HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PDM, peptide-directed monoclonal; ES, endostatin.tube formation assay on Matrigel (9Kuo C.

Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1233-1246Google Scholar). This phenomenon could not be demonstrated with the endostatin monomer. Furthermore, an analogous region from collagen 15 failed to induce similar morphological changes. In a parallel paper, it was shown that the Caenorhabditis elegans collagen 18 homologue, cle-1, promotes neuronal motility through its trimerization-competent NC1 domain (10Ackley B.D. Crew J.R. Elamaa H. Pihlajaniemi T. Kuo C.J. Kramer J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1219-1232Google Scholar). Recently, data were presented suggesting that endostatin binds to integrins (11Rehn M. Veikkola T. Kukk-Valdre E. Nakamura H. Ilmonen M. Lombardo C.R. Pihlajaniemi T. Alitalo K. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1024-1029Google Scholar) and tropomyosin (12MacDonald N.J.

A more detailed investigation by a different group implicated a cell surface glypican as a low affinity surface receptor for endostatin (13Karumanchi S.A. Jha V. Ramchandran R. Karihaloo A. Tsiokas L. Chan B. Dhanabal M. Hanai J. Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Keiser N. Kalluri R. Zeng H. Mukhopadyyay D. Chen R.L. Lander A.D. Hagihara K. Yamguchi Y. Sasisekharan R. Cantley L. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 811-822Google Scholar) with the binding strictly mediated by a heparan sulfate-GAG region of glypican. Morphogenesis of capillary-like tubes by placement of HUVECs on a basement membrane substratum recapitulates the structural features of vessel formation. The tube assay provides a system to investigate protein-protein interactions between the cell surface and the extracellular matrix. Here, we report that the motogenic properties of oligomeric endostatin in the Matrigel tube assay are mediated via two paths: first by its binding to laminin in the basement membrane and additionally by its association with heparan sulfate on the cell surface. These binding sites on endostatin are distinct, although there may be some overlap between the two domains. Based on our data we conclude that the oligomeric endostatin domain of collagen 18 is capable of binding laminin and a cell surface heparan sulfate with the possibility of providing a bridge between the two of them. Expression and purification of recombinant fusion proteins in mammalian cells including human Fc-endostatin dimer and human NC1-His6 of c18 have been described previously (9Kuo C. LaMontagne K.

For the expression of Fc-endostatin (R27A, R139A), the mutations were introduced to pdCs-Fc(D4K)- endostatin by the overlapping polymerase chain reaction technique (15Daugherty B.L. DeMartino J.A. Law M.F. Kawka D.W. Singer I.I. Mark G.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2471-2476Google Scholar), using sense primer 5′-C ATCGCC GGG GCC GAC TTC CA and antisense primer 5′-AA GTC GGC CCC GGC GAT GCC CC to introduce the Arg27 to Ala substitution (in bold type) and sense primer 5′-TAC TGT GAG ACG TGGGCT ACG GAG GC and antisense primer 5′-CTC CGTAGC CCA CGT CTC ACA to introduce the Arg139 to Ala substitution (in bold type). The proteins from myeloma-conditioned media were affinity-purified on protein A-Sepharose (Repligen Corp. Needham, MA). Recovery of bound protein was achieved by elution with 0.1 m citrate, pH 3, followed by neutralization using 2 m Tris, pH 8. Generation of the endostatin segment from the Fc fusion proteins was achieved by digestion with enterokinase, which recognizes the D4K sequence engineered between the Fc and endostatin segments. Further purification was achieved by size exclusion chromatography on Sephacryl-200 (Pharmacia Corp.). Hybridoma-conditioned media were screened by ELISA based on affinity to 200 ng of human endostatin in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9.6, bound to solid polyvinylcarbonate substrate (Falcon). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 2% (w/v) BSA (Sigma) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma). Affinity complexes were measured by the addition of secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase, followed by colorimetric detection using 2,2′-azino-di(3-ethyl-benzylthiazoline-6-sulfonate) substrate (Kirkegaard Perry Laboratories). Absorbance was measured on a SpectraMax (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer at 405 nm. Binding of endostatin and related proteins to laminin and BSA-heparin was performed as above, except that plate washings were carried out in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for heparin bindings. Immunoprecipitation studies were performed by mixing Fc-endostatin with purified murine laminin-1 or Matrigel (Becton Dickinson) in 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5, and protein A-Sepharose. The suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific binding was reduced by two washes with Tris-NaCl with 1% Nonidet P-40 followed by two washes with Tris-NaCl with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Alternatively, in addition to the above reagents, the immunoprecipitation buffer contained 0.25% gelatin or 0.2% BSA. Similar results were obtained in all cases. The proteins were extracted by reducing sample buffer and analyzed on SDS-PAGE using a 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gel (Bio-Rad), followed by nitrocellulose Western blot in Tris-glycine transfer buffer at 4 °C. The immunoblot was probed with a relevant polyclonal antibody diluted in milk buffer (3% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% BSA, 1% Tween 20, 1× PBS), washed, and then treated with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL (Pierce). The immunoblotting of active MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase are essentially done as described (9Kuo C. LaMontagne K. Garcia-Cardena G. Ackley B. Kalman D. Park S. Christofferson R. Kamihara J. Ding Y.H. Lo K.-M. Gillies S. Folkman J. Mulligan R. Javaherian K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1233-1246Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies were generated against recombinant human endostatin monomer. Balb/c female mice were immunized by subcutaneous (three different sites) injections of 100 ng of endostatin that was suspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and then emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma). Hybridoma-conditioned media were screened for binding to endostatin by ELISA. Selected hybridomas were further characterized by immunoprecipitation with protein G-Sepharose (Pharmacia Corp.) followed by Western blot analysis. Monoclonal antibody 12C1 was affinity-purified on protein A-Sepharose employing high salt conditions (16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 310-311Google Scholar). Elution was carried out using 0.1 mcitrate, pH 3, proceeded by neutralization with 2 m Tris, pH 8. After dialysis against PBS, each protein lot was stored at −20 °C. Separately, a monoclonal antibody termed “peptide-directed monoclonal” (PDM) was produced using the peptide sequence (amino acids 75–99) KDELLFPSWEALFSGSEGPLKPGAR (Multiple Peptide Systems). The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and then 50 ng of antigen was injected intraperitoneally in Balb/c female mice as described above. Purification of large scale hybridoma conditioned medium was performed similarly.

Mulligan R. Javaherian K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1233-1246Google Scholar). Matrigel (Becton Dickinson), an extracellular matrix preparation from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor, was plated on 24-well tissue culture plastic. Plugs formed at 37 °C incubation. HUVECs (Clonetics) were seeded at 50,000 cells/ml in EGM-2-MV medium (Clonetics). Recombinant proteins were added either at the time of plating (t = 0) or after incubation at 37 °C (t = 16 h) when cells have assembled into tube structures. Tube density measurements were performed by visual approximation. Purified laminin-1 (devoid of entactin) prepared from the same mouse tumor was purchased from Becton Dickinson. HUVECS were obtained from Clonetics and were maintained in endothelial growth medium (Promocell) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were removed from the culture dishes with PBS with 0.5 mm EDTA and washed twice in PBS with 1% BSA, 0.02% NaN3 (wash buffer). The cells were preincubated in wash buffer alone or in wash buffer containing 2500 units/ml heparin (Baxter Hyland Immuno, Vienna, Austria) at a cell density of 1 × 107 cells/ml on ice for 15 min. The binding reagents (antibodies) were prediluted in wash buffer with or without 2500 units/ml of heparin at a concentration of 40 μg/ml on ice for 15 min. Subsequently, cells (5 × 105) were incubated with binding reagents (final concentration, 10 μg/ml) for 30 min. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice with wash buffer, and binding of primary reagents was detected by goat anti-human Ig conjugated with Alexa 488 or with goat-anti mouse Ig conjugated with Oregon Green (Molecular Probes; final concentration, 20 μg/ml). After 30 min of incubation on ice and two washes with wash buffer, the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScalibur (Beckton Dickinson). For our study, endostatin dimer was generated by two methods. First, fusion of endostatin to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin γ-1 results in proximal dimerization by way of discrete monomer linkage to the disulfide bonded Fc fragment. Second, based on crystal structure evidence showing dimer association at glutamine 7, a mutation to cysteine yielded a covalently linked endostatin dimer conjugated to Fc (9Kuo C. LaMontagne K. Garcia-Cardena G. Ackley B. Kalman D. Park S. Christofferson R. Kamihara J. Ding Y.H. Lo K.-M. Gillies S. Folkman J. Mulligan R. Javaherian K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1233-1246Google Scholar). Upon enterokinase digestion, endostatin dimer was released. Further purification on S-200 gel filtration column resulted in an artificial endostatin dimer where the two endostatin monomers are covalently linked by a disulfide bond at amino acid position 7 (7Ding Y.-H. Javaherian K. Lo K.-M. Chopra R. Boehm T. Lanciotti J. Harris B.A. Li Y. Shapiro R. Hohenester E. Timpl R. Folkman J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 10443-10448Google Scholar, 9Kuo C. LaMontagne K. Garcia-Cardena G. Ackley B. Kalman D. Park S. Christofferson R. Kamihara J. Ding Y.H. Lo K.-M. Gillies S. Folkman J. Mulligan R. Javaherian K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1233-1246Google Scholar). Both types of endostatin dimer (Fc-endostatin and disulfide-bonded (Q7C) endostatin), plus trimer NC1 (a 38-kDa degradation product at the C terminus of collagen 18 that includes the endostatin region) demonstrated properties distinct from endostatin monomer. While examining the temporal requirements for ES domain oligomers to induce motogenic activity, we noted that extracellular matrix could be conditioned with c18 NC1 (ES trimer) or ES dimers, followed by change into medium without ES derivatives. Subsequent addition of cells resulted in full inhibitory activity. As demonstrated previously (9Kuo C. LaMontagne K. Garcia-Cardena G. Ackley B. Kalman D. Park S. Christofferson R. Kamihara J. Ding Y.H. Lo K.-M. Gillies S. Folkman J. Mulligan R. Javaherian K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1233-1246Google Scholar), collagen 18 NC1 and ES dimers conditioned the Matrigel to promote morphological changes of the cells in the tube assay, whereas endostatin monomer lacked such an activity (Fig.1). These data suggested the presence of endostatin-binding proteins in extracellular matrix preparations such as Matrigel. To identify proteins interacting with the ES domain during in vitro endothelial tube formation, we utilized the Fc-endostatin fusion protein, which retains motogenic activity by virtue of ES dimerization (9Kuo C. LaMontagne K. Garcia-Cardena G. Ackley B. Kalman D. Park S. Christofferson R. Kamihara J. Ding Y.H. Lo K.-M. Gillies S. Folkman J. Mulligan R. Javaherian K. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1233-1246Google Scholar) but also allows direct immunoprecipitation of ES-associated proteins by interaction of the Fc region with protein A-agarose. Upon incubation of Matrigel with Fc-endostatin and subsequent addition of protein A-agarose, two high molecular mass bands above 200 kDa were co-precipitated. No such protein bands were co-precipitated by parallel incubation with Fc alone (Fig.2 A). The presence of excess endostatin dimer in the immunoprecipitation solution completely blocked binding of Fc-endostatin to Matrigel-derived laminin (data not shown). In situ tryptic digestion of these protein bands followed by mass spectrum finger printing resulted in the identification of these protein bands as different chains of murine laminin-1 (data not shown). In some immunoprecipitation experiments, another minor protein band migrating at 150 kDa was detected. Amino acid sequencing of this protein established its identity as entactin, which is known to be tightly associated with laminin. The above data do not rule out the possibility that other proteins constituting the basement membrane also bind endostatin but were not detected because of a much lower concentration, relative to laminin. In addition, high molecular mass proteins of the basement membrane (subunit molecular mass > 400 kDa) may have also escaped our detection because of the constraints of gel electrophoresis size separation. In a separate experiment, anti-laminin polyclonal antibodies were employed to immunoprecipitate endostatin monomer, dimer, or NC1 bound to purified laminin-1 (Fig. 2 B). Bindings were observed mainly to dimer and NC1 with little affinity for monomer, consistent with our previous data. Timpl and co-workers (2Sasaki T. Fukai N. Mann K. Gohring W. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4249-4256Google Scholar) have reported that the binding affinity of laminin to NC1 is 100-fold higher than to monomer. Laminin complexes strongly with NC1, endostatin dimer, Fc-endostatin, but not endostatin monomer (Fig.3 A). Binding measurements were carried out by employing a series of endostatin concentrations, with laminin serving as the ligand (Fig. 3 B). Our estimates of half-maximal binding concentrations are 7 × 10−9and 4 × 10−9m for endostatin dimer and Fc-endostatin, respectively. A very weak binding for endostatin monomer was observed (data not shown). Purified murine laminin-1 was directly introduced at the time of cell seeding on Matrigel, in combination with endostatin dimer or alone. A series of concentrations of laminin were employed (Fig. 4 A). The exogenous laminin completely blocks the effect of dimer in disrupting tube formation. At a concentration of ∼40 μg/ml of laminin, the formation of tubes were almost uninhibited. Thus a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 (laminin molecular mass = 800,000 Da; endostatin dimer molecular mass = 40,000 Da) is sufficient to limit dimer activity. A similar experiment employing perlecan (a gift from Dr. John Whitelock) instead of laminin failed to block the effects of dimer (data not shown). Exogenous laminin was capable of blocking the effects of NC1 similar to the dimer (data not shown). Matrigel is rich with laminin. The fact that exogenous laminin can block motogenic properties of endostatin dimer raises questions. A possible explanation is that interactions of the cells with solidified Matrigel (required for formation of tubes) is a slow process (hours) because of inefficient kinetics, whereas the binding of exogenous laminin solution to the cells is a very fast reaction. To map the domain of laminin involved in binding to endostatin, laminin was digested with Staph A (strain V8), which cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of glutamic and asparatic acids. Digestion was followed by immunoprecipitation using Fc-endostatin. The protein complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig.5 A, lanes 4 and5). The nonreduced protein fragment (indicated by anarrow) was analyzed by trypsin digestion followed by mass spectroscopy. The data are presented in TableI. In general, a large number of peptides were identified between the two indicated terminals of each chain. Based on these data, given the absence of any peptides from regions I and II, we conclude that the N-terminal regions of the three chains participate in the complex formation with endostatin; from the α chain amino acids 204–1243, from the β chain amino acids 932–1161, and from the γ chain amino acids 150–965 comprise the laminin fragment coming in contact with endostatin. The proximity of the disulfide-bonded hinge region between regions II and III raises the possibility that it may be present in the isolated laminin fragment. Inclusion of the hinge region could account for the identification of interacting regions from all three chains, although in actuality endostatin may be in contact with one or two of the chains (Fig.5 B).Table ITrypsin digestion followed by mass spectra analysis of laminin fragment associated with endostatinChainIdentified N and C terminiDesignated domainsα204PSADDPSPQLLEFTSAR220VI, V, IVB, and IIIB (EGF-like)1231QFQGDQLLAYGGK1243β932SCYQDPVTLQLACVCDPGYIGSR954IV and III (EGF-like)1138GIETPQCDQSTGQCVCVEGVEGPR1161γ150FHTSRPESFAIYKRTREDGPWIPYQYYSGSCENTYSK186VI, V, IV, and III (EGF-like)949TGQCECQPGITGQHCER965Only N-terminal and C-terminal peptides identified in each chain are indicated.

The positions of amino acids in the laminin sequence are marked. Extensive trypsin digestion of laminin did not result in identification of a smaller fragment (data not shown). It is of some interest to point out that the mapped β region is much shorter than the other two chains. The heparin binding properties of monomeric endostatin are well established (8Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6248Google Scholar). Based on our preliminary experiments and those reported by others, a construct of human Fc-endostatin was engineered such that two arginines, 27 and 139, were mutated to alanine (6Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Google Scholar, 7Ding Y.-H. Javaherian K. Lo K.-M. Chopra R. Boehm T. Lanciotti J. Harris B.A. Li Y. Shapiro R. Hohenester E. Timpl R. Folkman J. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 95: 10443-10448Google Scholar). It has been reported previously that this mutant lacks heparin binding (8Sasaki T. Larsson H. Kreuger J. Salmivirta M. Claesson-Welsh L. Lindahl U. Hohenester E. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6240-6248Google Scholar). Analysis of the binding affinity of different endostatin constructs to BSA-heparin (Sigma) was undertaken. A general ELISA profile is shown in Fig. 6 A. Both endostatin monomer and dimer bind heparin, although dimer shows a slightly higher affinity for heparin. The Fc-endostatin mutant (R27A/R139A) fails to bind to heparin as expected. To obtain a more precise picture, we carried out binding measurements of different forms of endostatin to heparin. The data are presented in Fig. 6 B. Both proteins Fc and Fc-endostatin (R27A/R139A) did not demonstrate binding to heparin. The half-maximal binding concentration for human endostatin monomer to heparin is 3.8 × 10−6m, that for human Fc-endostatin 1.7 × 10−7m, and that for Fc-endostatin (Q7C) was found to be 3.6 × 10−7m. A similar binding profile was observed for NC1 (data not shown). Surprisingly, a higher affinity (1.6 × 10−8m) was observed with endostatin dimer (Q7C) upon removal of Fc. The Fc-endostatin mutant lacking heparin affinity failed to cause substantial morphological changes attributed to dimer (Fig.6 C). These results clearly demonstrate that the heparin-binding domain of endostatin dimer is important for conferring morphological changes in the tube assay. Based on solid phase binding studies, Fc-endostatin (R27A/R139A), which lacks binding to heparin, demonstrates strong binding to purified laminin (Fig. 3 A). Similar binding profiles were obtained for control endostatin dimers and Fc-endostatin mutant (Fig.3 B). However, co-immunoprecipitation of endostatin mutant (R27A/R139A) demonstrated considerably less affinity to either Matrigel-derived laminin or purified laminin (Fig. 6 D) using a series of laminin concentrations. In contrast to wild type endostatin, which bound laminin strongly, heparin binding deficient endostatin demonstrated a much lower affinity for laminin. The situation is to some extent similar to a large number of monoclonal antibodies showing strong binding to their ligands in solid phase format but lacking high affinity in immunoprecipitation assays. One such example was encountered in this study with a monoclonal antibody directed against a linear peptide fragment of endostatin (called PDM; discussed later). It strongly binds endostatin in an ELISA but is not capable of immunoprecipitating endostatin. Therefore, a likely explanation is that removal of two arginines important for heparin binding has caused a change in the conformation of endostatin, lowering its affinity for laminin. Solid phase assays are not very sensitive to such structural changes because by immobilizing a ligand on a solid surface, linear protein sequences are exposed, which are otherwise parts of three-dimensional structures of the native molecule. A number of monoclonal antibodies were prepared against human endostatin monomer. These were screened for inhibiting the scattering activity of dimer in tube assay. 12C1 was a highly potent neutralizing monoclonal that showed more than 90% inhibition of dimer activity at a molar ratio of 1:2 (monoclonal:dimer) (Fig.7 A). In parallel, another monoclonal was generated against a linear peptide of endostatin, called PDM (see “Experimental Procedures”). A set of overlapping peptides corresponding to the complete sequence of endostatin were employed to map the epitopes of 12C1, using PDM as a control (see “Experimental Procedures”) using ELISA experiments. In contrast to PDM, which bound to its corresponding peptide, 12C1 failed to show any binding to linear peptides derived from endostatin (data not shown). PDM failed to inhibit scattering activity of endostatin dimer (Fig.7 A). By ELISA, monoclonal 12C1 blocks binding of endostatin dimer to laminin, whereas PDM had no effect (Fig. 3 A). It also blocks binding of purified laminin and Matrigel to endostatin dimer in the immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 7 B). In the same context, 12C1 immunoprecipitated both endostatin monomer and R27A/R139A monomer (Fig. 7 B). We conclude that monoclonal 12C1, by blocking binding of oligomeric endostatin to laminin, prevents scattering morphology associated with oligomeric endostatin. To investigate binding of oligomeric endostatin to cell surface, we employed flow cytometry. At 10 μg/ml, Fc-endostatin bound to HUVECs, causing a"

Although some tumor cells are sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), many ovarian tumor cells are not. 6-((1-Admantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (CD437) is a conformationally restricted synthetic retinoid that induces growth arrest and apoptosis in both ATRA-sensitive and ATRA-resistant ovarian tumor cell lines. To better understand the mechanism by which CD437 induces apoptosis in ovarian tumor cell lines, we prepared a cell line, CA-CD437R, from the ATRA-sensitive ovarian cell line, CA-OV-3, which was resistant to CD437. We found that the CD437-resistant cell line was also resistant to the induction of apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor-α but not resistant to the induction of apoptosis by another synthetic retinoid, fenretinideN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide. We also show that this cell line remains ATRA-sensitive and exhibits no deficiencies in RAR function. Analysis of this CD437-resistant cell line suggests that the pathway for induction of apoptosis by CD437 is similar to the pathway utilized by tumor necrosis factor-α and different from the pathway induced by the synthetic retinoid, fenretinideN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide. The CA-CD437R cell line is a valuable tool, permitting us to further elucidate the molecular events that mediate apoptosis induced by CD437 and other synthetic retinoids. Results of experiments utilizing this cell line suggest that the alteration responsible for resistance of CA-CD437R cells to CD437 induced event maps after the activation of p38 and TR3 expression, prior to mitochondrial depolarization, subsequent release of cytochromec and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3.

Because retinoid treatment inhibits the growth of a variety of epithelial cancers, retinoids have great promise in the area of cancer chemotherapy and chemoprevention (3De Luca L.M.

Thus determination of the mechanism by which these synthetic retinoids inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of ovarian tumors could lead to the development of more effective cancer treatments.

Holmes, D. Robert Soprano, and K. J. Soprano, unpublished observation. In this investigation we describe the isolation and characterization of an ovarian carcinoma cell line, CA-CD437R, which has been made resistant to the apoptotic effects of CD437. This cell line, isolated from the CA-OV-3 ovarian tumor cell line, is resistant to the effects of CD437 treatment, but is not resistant to apoptosis induced by 4-HPR. Interestingly this cell line is also resistant to the apoptotic effects of TNF-α. Our results suggest that these two retinoids use separate apoptotic inducing pathways. This cell line is a valuable tool, which can be used to compare molecular mechanisms leading to apoptosis induced by CD437 and 4-HPR in ovarian carcinoma cells. CA-OV-3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Stock cultures of CA-OV-3 and CA-CD437R were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, and 100 units/ml nystatin. All cell lines were routinely split at a ratio of 1:10 weekly. The plates were incubated in an atmosphere of 98% humidified 5% CO2. ATRA was kindly supplied by Hoffmann-La Roche (Nutley, New Jersey). CD437 was a generous gift of Galderma Research and Development (Sophia Antipolis, France). 4-HPR was generously provided by R. W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute (Raritan, NJ). Retinoid stock solutions (10−3m) prepared in Me2SO were stored at −70 °C. Recombinant human TNF-α was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All procedures involving retinoids were carried out under subdued light. In each experiment, control cultures were treated with an equivalent amount of Me2SO. The CA-CD437R cell line was isolated from the CA-OV-3 ovarian tumor cell line. CA-OV-3 cells were cultured for 6 months in complete medium with increasing concentrations of CD437. The concentration of CD437 synthetic retinoid was progressively increased from 10−10m to a concentration of 10−6m over the 6-month period of time. The CA-CD437R cell line has been cultured for over 18 months, during this time every 14 days the medium was supplemented with 10−6m CD437 for a period of 5 days to ensure continued resistance. The CA-CD437R cell line did not revert to a CD437-sensitive phenotype similar to the parental CA-OV-3 cell line upon removal of selective pressure. Before CA-CD437R cells were used in experiments, CD437 selective pressure was applied to stock CA-CD437R cultures, for a period of 48 h. The stock cultures were then trypsinized and plated in complete medium without CD437 as needed for each specific experiment. Ovarian carcinoma cells were seeded onto 100-mm tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 104cells/plate. The cells were incubated for 48 h prior to treatment. The medium, with or without varying concentrations of retinoids, was changed every 2 days. On the days indicated, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and counted using a hemocytometer. Cells were assessed for viability using trypan blue. All cell counts were repeated in triplicate. Detection of apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells was performed via an ELISA as described by Salgame et al. (26Salgame P. Varadhachary A.S. Primiano L.L. Fincke J.E. Muller S. Monestier M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 680-681Google Scholar). The ELISA uses a capture monoclonal antibody (LG11-2), which is specific for residues 1–25 of the amino-terminal domain of histone H2B, and a biotinylated detection monoclonal antibody (PL2-3), which is specific for the nucleosome subparticle composed of histones H2A, H2B, and DNA. The presence of histones in the cytoplasm is indicative of apoptosis. The ELISA was quantitated by measuring absorbance at 405 nm using a V max Kinetic Reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). RAR transcriptional activity was assayed using a pRARE-CAT reporter plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. R. Evans of the Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) and a commercially available pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (Clontech). Transient transfection was performed using the Effectene transfection kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm tissue culture plates in complete DMEM and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator 1 day prior to transfection. 1 μg of pRARE-CAT plasmid DNA and 1 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid DNA was diluted in the DNA condensation buffer to a final volume of 150 μl. The mixture was centrifuged and mixed with 25 μl of Effectene transfection reagent. The medium was then removed from the culture plates, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and 4 ml of fresh complete DMEM was added. 1 ml of complete DMEM was added to the DNA mixture and the mixture was added dropwise onto the cells. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h at which time the cells were treated with either 10−6m ATRA or Me2SO carrier. After an additional 24 h the cells were harvested and assayed for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity (CAT) (27Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Google Scholar) and β-galactosidase activity (28Eustice D.C. Feldman P.A. Colberg-Poley A.M. Buckery R.M. Neubauer R.H. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 739-740Google Scholar). CAT was normalized with respect to β-galactosidase activity to control for efficiency of transfection. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. The activity of caspase proteases was measured using an ApoAlert CPP32 colorimetric assay kit (Clontech). Briefly, whole cell lysate from ∼4 × 106 ovarian cells was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with the caspase-specific substrate in the provided reaction buffer. Cleavage of the caspase-specific substrate by active caspase resulted in the liberation of pNA (p-nitroanilide) into solution. Release of pNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 405 nm using a V maxkinetic reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All experiments were repeated in triplicate. The following specific caspase substrates were utilized in these studies: Ac-DEVD-pNA (caspase-3/7) (Clontech), Ac-VEID-pNA (caspase-6), Ac-IETD-pNA (caspase-8) and Ac-LEHD-pNA (caspase-9) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Ovarian carcinoma cells were seeded onto 100-mm tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/plate. The cells were incubated for 48 h prior to treatment. 1 h prior to retinoid treatment, 20 μg/ml of the caspase-3-like inhibitor DEVD-cmk (Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) was added. The effect of inhibiting caspase-3-like activity on retinoid-induced growth arrest and apoptosis was determined by direct cell counting and/or apoptotic ELISA. All experiments were repeated in triplicate. The rate of oxygen consumption was measured using a YSI model 5300 biological oxygen monitor that employs a Clark-type oxygen electrode (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH). 6 × 106 cells were trypsinized and suspended in 3 ml of complete DMEM culture medium in a 3-ml respiration chamber with continuous stirring. The respiration chamber was placed in a circulating water bath at 37 °C and the oxygen electrode was inserted into the respiration chamber eliminating any air space between the oxygen electrode and the surface of the culture medium. The oxygen electrode was calibrated using complete DMEM without cells. The rate of oxygen consumption was measured over 10-min time periods and the respiration rates were normalized (nanomole of O2/min/106 cells) assuming 220 μmO2 concentration in air-saturated medium at 37 °C (29Hail Jr., N. Youssef E.M. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6698-6702Google Scholar). Retinoid and control treatments were added directly to the culture medium through a channel in the electrode holder, using a Hamilton syringe, without separating the electrode from the surface of the culture medium. Measurements were carried out under low light conditions. CD437 treatments were done at a concentration of 10−6m. Treatments greater than 1 h were performed as reported in Hail et al. (29Hail Jr., N. Youssef E.M. Lotan R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6698-6702Google Scholar) with the modification that the number of cells tested was 6 × 106 cells. Cell numbers were adjusted using numbers determined by direct cell counts after respiration determinations. A PCR method reported by Wei et al. (32Wei Y.H. Kao S.H. Lee H.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 786: 24-43Google Scholar) was used to detect mitochondrial DNA sequences. This method was employed to determine the effects on mitochondrial number associated with CD437 exposure for long periods of time and to determine the relative proportion of mitochondrial DNA in the CA-CD437R cell line as compared with the CA-OV-3 cell line. To determine the linear range of the PCR reactions, the reactions were carried out for 37, 40, and 43 cycles, as recommended in Wei et al. (32Wei Y.H. Kao S.H. Lee H.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 786: 24-43Google Scholar), in a thermal cycler using primers specific for mitochondrial DNA (L1–5′-AACATACCCATGGCCAACCT-3′ and H1–5′-GGCAGGAGTAATCAGAGGTG-3′). The L1-H1 primers were used for the amplification of a 533-bp fragment from the total mitochondrial DNA. The first cycle involved a 3-min denaturation at 94 °C, 3-min annealing at 55 °C, and a 1-min extension at 72 °C. The other cycles were as follows: denaturation of 40 s at 94 °C, annealing for 40 s at 55 °C, and a 50-s extension at 72 °C. Two μl of mitochondrial DNA was amplified in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 200 μm of each dNTP, 0.4 μm of each primer, 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. We modified the original method by adding 1 μl of 35S-labeled dATP (10 mCi/ml) to the reaction mixture. The proper size and relative amounts of PCR product was determined by phosphorimaging (Cyclone Phosphor System and Optiquant Image Analysis software, Packard Instrument Co., Meridian, CT). A method described by Poot et al. (30Poot M. Zhang Y.Z. Kramer J.A. Wells K.S. Jones L.J. Hanzel D.K. Lugade A.G. Singer V.L. Haugland R.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1363-1372Google Scholar) was used to determine the permeability of mitochondria after treatment with 4-HPR and CD437. After a 12-h treatment with retinoids, cells were stained with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (8-(4′-chloromethyl)phenyl-2,3,5,6,11,12,14,15-octahydro-1H,4H,10H,13H-diquinolizino-8H-xanthylium chloride) from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Culture medium was added to the cells and the fluorescent mitochondrial probe CMXRos was added at a final concentration of 0.25 μg/ml for 15 min at room temperature. After two rinses for 2 min each with culture medium the cells were wet mounted with culture media and sealed with silicone. Images were visualized using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300, Japan) and camera (Nikon Digital Camera DXM1200, Japan). RT-PCR was used to detect TR3 expression using the Advantage RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech). In brief, the RT reaction was carried out with 1 μg of total RNA, from cells treated for 8 h with CD437, in H2O to a total volume of 12.5 μl into which was added 1 μl of oligo(dT)18 primer, 4 μl of 5× reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, and 3 mm MgCl2), 1 μl of dNTP mixture (10 mm each), 0.5 μl of RNase inhibitor, and 1 μl of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 42 °C, then heated for 5 min at 94 °C to stop the reaction. The cDNA mixture was diluted to 100 μl. The PCR reaction was carried out in a thermal cycler using primers specific for human TR3 (5′-TCATGGACGGCTACACAG-3′ and 5′-GTAGGCATGGAATAGCTC-3′) (31Chen X. Zachar V. Chang C. Ebbesen P. Liu X. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6902-6906Google Scholar). To determine the linear range of the reaction, samples are removed from the PCR reaction at 20, 25, and 30 cycles. These primers were used for the amplification of a 517-bp fragment of the TR3 cDNA. The cycles were as follows: denaturation of 45 s at 94 °C, annealing for 45 s at 60 °C, and a 2-min extension at 72 °C. Five μl of the cDNA mixture was amplified in a 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 200 μm of each dNTP, 0.4 μm of each primer, 1 unit of TaqDNA polymerase (Promega), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, and 1 μl of35S-labeled dATP (10 mCi/ml). Quantitation of the PCR product was determined by phosphorimaging (Cyclone Phosphor System and Optiquant Image Analysis software, Packard Instrument Co.). Differences in the level of a variety of mitochondrial proteins associated with apoptosis including Bid, Bad, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-x (Transduction Laboratories), caspase-3, caspase-12, and cytochrome c (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were determined by Western blotting as we have described previously (33Zhang D. Vuocolo S. Masciullo V. Sava T. Giordano A. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7935-7944Google Scholar). An antisense approach was used to determine the importance of caspase-12 function after treatment with CD437 using a modification of a method described by Nakagawa (34Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Google Scholar). The sequence of the antisense caspase-12 oligo was: 5′-thiol modification-TGTCCTCCTGGCCGCCATGGCTGT-3′. A scrambled caspase-12 oligo was used as a control: 5′-thiol modification-GTCGCTCTGTACGCCTGTGCCTG-3′. In brief, 5 × 105 cells were plated into 100-mm culture dishes in complete DMEM. Twenty-four hours later the cells were treated with antisense caspase-12 oligonucleotides or the control oligonucleotide representing a scrambled caspase-12 sequence. 1 h after the addition of oligonucleotides, retinoids were added to the culture. The cells were assessed for reduction of caspase-12 protein expression by Western blot, viability by direct cell count, and induction of apoptosis by ELISA. To determine the role of p38 MAP kinase activation in induction of apoptosis the cell-permeable p38 MAP kinase inhibitors SB 203580 and PD 169316 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) were added to culture medium 1 h prior to CD437 or 4-HPR treatments. A commercially available kit was used to measure MAP kinase activity (MAPK In Vivo Kinase Assay kit Clontech). Briefly, 4 × 105 cells/well were cultured in 6-well plates. These cells were transfected with the p38 target protein ATF, a negative control or a positive control using the Effectene (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) transfection protocol. The cells were co-transfected with luciferase reporter and pCMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech). Cells were treated with CD437, 4-HPR, or the p38 inhibitor PD 169316 (Calbiochem) 24 h after transfection. After 6 h cell lysates were collected and luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer (Femtomaster FB 12, Zylux Corp., Oak Ridge, TN). The results of the luminometer measurements were normalized by β-galactosidase levels. We have previously demonstrated that CD437 treatment induced apoptosis in the CA-OV-3 ovarian cancer cell line (6Wu S. Zhang D. Donigan A. Dawson M.I. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 378-388Google Scholar,16Holmes W.F. Dawson M.I. Soprano R.D. Soprano K.J. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 185: 61-67Google Scholar). The CA-CD437R cell line was generated by culturing CA-OV-3 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of CD437 over a period of 6 months. CA-CD437R cells were treated with a concentration of CD437 of 10−6m because this concentration was previously found to be the most effective at inducing apoptosis in ovarian tumor cell lines (6Wu S. Zhang D. Donigan A. Dawson M.I. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 378-388Google Scholar, 16Holmes W.F. Dawson M.I. Soprano R.D. Soprano K.J. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 185: 61-67Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows that over a treatment period of 120 h, the CA-CD437R cell line did not undergo apoptosis as determined by apoptosis ELISA. For comparison, the parental cell line CA-OV-3 did undergo apoptosis after treatment with CD437. It should be noted that we have treated CA-CD437R cells for as long as 7 days with CD437 and have failed to observe apoptosis. Thus, these results clearly indicate that the cell line selected over the 6-month treatment period is resistant to CD437 and not merely less sensitive, requiring longer treatments. Whereas CA-CD437R cells were resistant to CD437-induced apoptosis it is possible that these cells might still be sensitive to growth arrest by CD437. It has been reported by our laboratory and others that CD437 treatment is able to induce growth arrest in a number of tumor cells (6Wu S. Zhang D. Donigan A. Dawson M.I. Soprano D.R. Soprano K.J. J.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18990-18999Google Scholar). Parental CA-OV-3 and CA-CD437R cell lines were treated with 10−6m CD437 and viable cell counts were determined daily following treatment. Fig. 1 B shows that CA-CD437R cells were not growth arrested by CD437 treatment. As expected, treatment with CD437-induced growth inhibition and reduction in cell number of parental CA-OV-3 cells. Moreover, resistance to growth inhibition did not change with increased time of exposure to CD437. These results are consistent with our previous findings that CA-CD437R cells have been selected to be resistant to the effects of CD437 treatment. Taken together, our results using the apoptotic ELISA and direct cell counts indicate that the CA-CD437R cell line is resistant to both the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of CD437. The results described above indicate that the CA-CD437R cell line is resistant to CD437-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis. We next wished to determine the stability of this cell line when the selective pressure of CD437 treatment was removed for extended periods of time. If this cell line remained resistant after removal of the selective pressure it is likely that resistance to CD437 results from a permanent change to the genome of the CA-OV-3 cells. CA-CD437R cells are normally cultured with CD437 selective pressure 5 of every 14 days. CD437 was removed from the CA-CD437R cell culture for extended periods of time, and then these cells were exposed to CD437 for 5 days and assayed for growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. We found that CD437 treatment of the CA-CD437R cell line does not induce growth inhibition or apoptosis even when selective pressure is removed for as long as 84 days (data not shown). Thus the CA-CD437R cell line does not revert back to a CD437-sensitive phenotype when grown for extended periods of time in the absence of CD437. To determine whether the CA-CD437R cell line was also resistant to ATRA we determ"

To understand how DnaJ targets specific proteins for recognition by the DnaK chaperone system, we investigated the interaction of DnaJ and DnaK with a known natural substrate, bacteriophage P1 RepA protein. By characterizing RepA deletion derivatives, we found that DnaJ interacts with a region of RepA located between amino acids 180 and 200 of the 286-amino acid protein. A peptide corresponding to amino acids 180–195 inhibited the interaction of RepA and DnaJ. Two site-directed RepA mutants with alanine substitutions in this region were about 4-fold less efficiently activated for oriP1 DNA binding by DnaJ and DnaK than wild type RepA. We also identified by deletion analysis a site in RepA, in the region of amino acids 35–49, which interacts with DnaK. An alanine substitution mutant in amino acids 36–39 was constructed and found defective in activation by DnaJ and DnaK. Taken together the results suggest that DnaJ and DnaK interact with separate sites on RepA. DnaK, the Hsp70 chaperone of Escherichia coli interacts with protein substrates in an ATP-dependent manner, in conjunction with DnaJ and GrpE co-chaperones, to carry out protein folding, protein remodeling, and assembly and disassembly of multisubunit protein complexes.

DnaK, the Escherichia coli Hsp70 homologue, is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone that acts in conjunction with the co-chaperones, DnaJ and GrpE, to mediate protein folding and remodeling reactions in the cell. The DnaK and Hsp70 chaperone systems participate in a wide variety of cellular processes in both normal and stressed cells, including nascent protein folding, protein trafficking across intracellular membranes, proteolysis, assembly of multiprotein structures, disassembly of protein aggregates, cell division, DNA replication of several phage and plasmids, and regulation of the heat shock response (see Refs. 1Frydman J.

Cell. 2000; 101: 119-122Google Scholar for recent reviews). Structural studies have shown that DnaK, like other Hsp70s, consists of an N-terminal ATP-binding domain and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (4Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Google Scholar, 5Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Google Scholar). Cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the N-terminal domain modulate peptide binding by DnaK (6Szabo A. Langer T. Schroder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Google Scholar, 7Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Mogk A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5452-5457Google Scholar, 8Mayer M.P. Rudiger S. Bukau B. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 877-885Google Scholar). In the ATP-bound state, DnaK binds and releases substrates rapidly, whereas in the ADP-bound state, binding and release is slow (9Schmid D. Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Google Scholar, 10Russell R. Wali Karzai A. Mehl A.F. McMacken R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4165-4176Google Scholar). DnaJ and GrpE regulate cycling between the two states. DnaJ stimulates DnaK ATPase, forming the ADP state of DnaK, which stably interacts with the polypeptide substrate (11McCarty J.S. Buchberger A. Reinstein J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 126-137Google Scholar). In addition, DnaJ tags several proteins for recognition by DnaK (23Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Google Scholar, 43). GrpE is a nucleotide exchange factor, binding to the ATPase domain of DnaK and inducing the exchange of bound ADP with ATP (12Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Google Scholar, 13Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Google Scholar). Studies to elucidate the interaction of DnaK and Hsp70 with peptides showed that the chaperones recognize heptameric extended peptides enriched in hydrophobic residues (14Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Google Scholar, 15Landry S.J. Jordan R. McMacken R. Gierasch L.M. Nature. 1992; 355: 455-457Google Scholar, 16Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E.

Biol. 1994; 235: 848-854Google Scholar). Bukau and co-workers (18Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Google Scholar) performed an extensive study of more than 4000 cellulose-bound peptides spanning sequences of biologically relevant substrates to identify a consensus DnaK binding motif. The motif consists of a hydrophobic core of four or five residues enriched in Leu and to a lesser extent in Ile, Val, Phe, and Tyr, and two flanking regions enriched in basic residues. These sites occur in proteins, not just biologically relevant proteins, on average every 36 residues (18Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Google Scholar). The DnaJ binding motif was studied by a similar method and found to consist of a hydrophobic core of about 8 residues enriched for aromatic and large aliphatic hydrophobic residues and arginine (19Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Google Scholar). Although this motif is slightly different from the DnaK binding motif, DnaJ is able to bind most of the same peptides as DnaK (19Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Google Scholar). Because of the hydrophobic nature of the motifs, DnaK- and DnaJ-binding sites typically reside in the interior of correctly folded proteins and are only exposed in nascent or unfolded polypeptides. Identification of the DnaJ and DnaK peptide binding motifs helps explain how the chaperone system can interact with unfolded polypeptides. However, in non-stress conditions DnaK protein comprises more than 1% of the total cell protein and is essential for normal growth (20Bukau B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2337-2346Google Scholar). DnaK would pose a danger to the cell if it indiscriminately unfolded active proteins or dissociated complexes. One of several characterized reactions that the DnaK chaperone system carries out during non-stress situations is the maintenance of plasmid mini-P1 (21Bukau B. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6030-6038Google Scholar, 22Tilly K. Yarmolinsky M. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6025-6029Google Scholar). In vitro, DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE are required for DNA replication of mini-P1 and their sole function is to activate origin-specific DNA binding by RepA by converting inactive RepA dimers to active monomers (23Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Google Scholar, 24Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7903-7907Google Scholar, 25Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Google Scholar, 26Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Google Scholar). ClpA, a member of the Clp/Hsp100 family of ATP-dependent molecular chaperones, also activates DNA binding by P1 RepA by converting inactive dimers to active monomers (27Wickner S. Gottesman S. Skowyra D. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12218-12222Google Scholar). Studies to elucidate substrate recognition by ClpA have shown that it recognizes some substrates through N-terminal motifs and others through C-terminal motifs (28Tobias J.W. Shrader T.E. Rocap G. Varshavsky A. Science. 1991; 254: 1374-1377Google Scholar, 29Gottesman S. Roche E. Zhou Y. Sauer R.T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1338-1347Google Scholar, 30Hoskins J.R. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Wickner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8892-8897Google Scholar). RepA is recognized through a motif near the N terminus, between amino acids 10 and 15 (31). To address the question of how the DnaK chaperone system recognizes specific native substrates, we determined regions within a known substrate, P1 RepA, which are recognized by DnaJ and DnaK. ATP was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from New England BioLabs and polymerase chain reaction reagents were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Peptides were synthesized, purified, and analyzed by mass spectrophotometry by Research Genetics Inc. Rabbit anti-DnaJ serum and mouse anti-DnaK monoclonal antibody were obtained from StressGen Biotechnologies. Rabbit anti-RepA serum was produced by Research Genetics Inc. using purified RepA. The construction of plasmids expressing N-terminal deletions of RepA, including RepA-(16–286), RepA-(26–286), RepA-(36–286), RepA-(50–286), and RepA-(1–180), was previously described (31Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing C-terminal deletions of RepA were constructed by generating appropriate repA polymerase chain reaction fragments containing 5′ NdeI and 3′BamHI sites. The fragments were then ligated into pET19b (Novagen), containing a N-terminal deca-His tag. The sequences of all of mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. 3H-LabeledoriP1 plasmid DNA (3590 cpm/fmol) was prepared as described (25Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Google Scholar). Site-directed alanine substitution mutants of wild type RepA-His6 were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the protocol recommended by the supplier. In RepA-mut1, amino acids Tyr-190, Val-192, Leu-193, and Leu-194 were changed to alanines, in RepA-mut2, amino acids Leu-193, Leu-194, His-196, and His-197 were converted to alanines, and in RepA-mut3 amino acids Arg-36, Leu-37, Gly-38, and Val-39 were converted to alanines. DnaJ (32Zylicz M. Yamamoto T. McKittrick N. Sell S. Georgopoulos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7591-7598Google Scholar), DnaK (26Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Google Scholar), GrpE (26Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Google Scholar), and RepA (23Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Google Scholar) were purified as described. RepA N-terminal deletion proteins, RepA-(50–286), and alanine substitution mutants were isolated by the method described for RepA (23Wickner S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2690-2694Google Scholar). The purity of all proteins was greater than 95% as determined by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations are expressed as molar amounts of RepA dimers, DnaJ dimers, DnaK monomers, and GrpE dimers. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained Buffer A (20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v)), 10 mm MgOAc, 1 mmATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05 pmol of RepA, 0.5 pmol of DnaJ, and 10 pmol of DnaK, unless indicated otherwise. After 10 min at 24 °C, calf thymus DNA (1 μg) and 10 fmol of [3H]oriP1 plasmid DNA were added. The mixtures were then filtered through nitrocellulose filters, the filters were washed, and the retained radioactivity was measured. Activation by ClpA was measured in similar reaction mixtures but with 0.5 pmol of ClpA in place of DnaJ and DnaK. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) contained 1 μmRepA or the RepA derivative, and where indicated, 1 μmDnaJ, and 2 μm DnaK in Buffer A with 5 mmMgOAc, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP. After 10 min at room temperature, 400 μl of Buffer B (50 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) and 1 μl of anti-RepA rabbit serum were added. The mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with rocking. Then, 15 μl of a 1:1 (v/v) slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in Buffer B was added and incubated 30 min at 4 °C with rocking. The resin was collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with 500 μl of 50 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, and 0.1 mm EDTA. The precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Applied Biotechnologies) by electroblotting. Following transfer, DnaJ, DnaK, and RepA were detected with specific antibodies using a chemiluminiscence blotting substrate kit (Novex Western Breeze, Invitrogen). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell extracts, BL21 cells expressing His-tagged RepA or RepA derivatives were lysed by a French pressure cell and then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble extracts (50 μl) were incubated with anti-RepA rabbit serum and processed as above. RepA (5 pmol/well in 50 μl of PBS) was immobilized in 96-well microtiter plates (Corning) by incubating for 1 h at room temperature and then washed three times with 150 μl of PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20). DnaJ was preincubated for 10 min alone or with various peptides in 50 μl of PBSTB (PBST containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and added to the wells and incubated for 10 min. The amount of bound DnaJ was determined as follows. The wells were washed three times with 150 μl of PBST and then 50 μl of PBST containing anti-DnaJ rabbit serum was added. After 30 min, the wells were washed three times with 150 μl of PBST and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Calbiochem) was used as a secondary antibody. Microtiter plates were scanned using a plate reader (Bio-Rad) and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. To investigate the mechanism of native protein recognition by the DnaK chaperone system, we studied the interaction of DnaK and DnaJ with P1 RepA. DnaK and DnaJ activate the latent P1ori-specific DNA binding activity of RepA by converting inactive dimers to active monomers (24Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7903-7907Google Scholar, 25Wickner S. Hoskins J. McKenney K. Nature. 1991; 350: 165-167Google Scholar); GrpE is also required under certain conditions to facilitate nucleotide exchange (26Skowyra D. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25296-25301Google Scholar). We tested N-terminal deletion mutants of RepA for their ability to be activated by the combination of DnaK and DnaJ and found that RepA mutants lacking 5, 10, or 15 amino acids were activated as well as wild type RepA (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). A deletion missing 25 amino acids was also activated, but to a lesser extent. However, this derivative was also partially defective in DNA binding following activation by treatment with guanidine HCl, suggesting that its defect was not in chaperone recognition but in DNA recognition (Ref. 31Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Google Scholar and data not shown). Deletion derivatives of greater than 25 amino acids were not tested because of their impaired DNA binding activity. In contrast, RepA derivatives lacking 15 N-terminal amino acids were not activated by the ClpA molecular chaperone, whereas derivatives lacking 5 or 10 amino acids were activated (Fig. 1 B (31Hoskins J.R. Kim S.Y. Wickner S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35361-35367Google Scholar)). The results with the derivatives lacking 15 and 25 amino acids indicate that the DnaJ/DnaK chaperone recognition signal in RepA is C-terminal to amino acid 26 and is distinct from the ClpA recognition motif. To explore the region or regions of RepA recognized by DnaJ, co-immunoprecipitation assays were used to detect DnaJ-RepA interactions. Mixtures containing DnaJ and RepA or a RepA deletion derivative were incubated with RepA antiserum and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis with DnaJ antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that DnaJ associated with wild type RepA and RepA lacking the N-terminal 49 amino acids, RepA-(50–286), but not with RepA lacking the C-terminal 106 amino acids, RepA-(1–180) (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 2, 4, and 6). These results suggested that a DnaJ recognition signal or signals resides in the C-terminal third of RepA, between amino acids 180 and 286. To locate the DnaJ recognition site in RepA more precisely, we constructed five RepA derivatives containing C-terminal deletions. Immunoprecipitation experiments using RepA antiserum and lysates of cells expressing the various derivatives were performed and RepA and DnaJ were detected by Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates. Control experiments showed that the cell lysates contained RepA or a RepA deletion derivative and DnaJ (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1–5). Two species of RepA-(1–240) were seen, perhaps the result of degradation. We observed that DnaJ co-immunoprecipitated well with RepA derivatives lacking the C-terminal 26 or 46 amino acids (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6and 7). It co-immunoprecipitated less well with derivatives lacking 66 or 86 amino acids (Fig. 2 B, lanes 8and 9). In contrast, DnaJ was not detected in co-immunoprecipitates with a derivative missing 102 amino acids (Fig.2 B, lane 10). These results suggest that the region in RepA between amino acids 185 and 201 is necessary for the interaction with DnaJ and amino acids in the region of 201–220 contribute to the interaction with DnaJ. We performed competition experiments using RepA peptides to verify that DnaJ recognized a site in the region of amino acids 185 and 201. For these experiments five RepA peptides were used, corresponding to RepA amino acids 175–189, 180–195, 185–200, 190–206, and 196–211 (Fig.3 A). Wild type RepA was immobilized in microtiter plate wells and then DnaJ alone or DnaJ that had been mixed with one of the RepA peptides was added to the wells. After washing, DnaJ-RepA complexes were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RepA-(180–195) peptide inhibited the interaction of RepA and DnaJ about 90% and 185–200 peptide was inhibited about 20% (Fig. 3 B). With this assay, no inhibition by 175–189, 190–206, and 196–211 peptides was detected. A titration experiment showed that 8 μm RepA-(180–195) peptide inhibited the RepA-DnaJ interaction about 50% (Fig.3 C). These results suggest that a DnaJ-binding site resides between amino acids 180 and 200 of RepA. A potential problem with the experiments using deletion derivatives was that the proteins may have been misfolded and their lack of interaction with DnaJ may not have reflected the disruption of a true DnaJ-binding site in native RepA. Thus, to substantiate the results of the deletion analysis and peptide inhibition studies, two site-directed mutants were constructed in the region identified by the peptide inhibition experiments. In one mutant, RepA-mut1, alanines were substituted for Tyr-190, Val-192, Leu-193, and Leu-194. In the other, RepA-mut2, Leu-193, Leu-194, His-196, and His-197 were replaced with alanines. We tested the ability of these mutants to be activated by the DnaJ/DnaK system (Fig. 4 A). Both mutants were 3–4-fold less efficiently activated for oriP1 DNA binding by DnaJ and DnaK than wild type RepA. In contrast, ClpA activated oriP1 DNA binding by both of the mutants to a similar extent as wild type, suggesting that the mutant proteins are native dimers and can refold into active monomers (Fig. 4 B). DNA binding by the mutant proteins was also activated to a similar extent as wild type RepA by treatment with 6 m urea followed by dilution (data not shown). These observations suggest that RepA-mut1 and RepA-mut2 are specifically defective in their ability to be remodeled by DnaJ and DnaK and imply that residues important for recognition are in amino acids 190–197. Because RepA-(190–206) peptide did not appear to interact with DnaJ, it is possible that necessary features of the site are in the region of amino acids 180–190 as well as in the region of 190–197. Taken together, the results of the deletion analysis, the peptide inhibition studies, and the site-directed mutant work indicate that a DnaJ interaction site in RepA is in the region of amino acids 180–200. When the immunoprecipitates generated by treating lysates of cells expressing C-terminal RepA derivatives with RepA antiserum (described in Fig. 2 B) were probed for DnaK by Western blot analysis, DnaK could be seen associated with all of the C-terminal deletion proteins, although somewhat less appeared to associate with RepA-(1–184), RepA-(1–201), and RepA-(1–220) (Fig.5 A, lanes 4,6,8,10, and 12). In a control experiment, DnaK was not detected when a lysate that did not express a RepA derivative was used (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). Thus, DnaK appears to interact with one or more sites in the N-terminal 184 amino acids of RepA. Association of DnaK with RepA-(1–184), which does not interact with DnaJ, indicates that DnaK and DnaJ interact with separate motif/motifs on RepA, although previous work has shown that many peptides that bind DnaK also bind DnaJ (19Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Google Scholar). To identify a region in the N-terminal portion of RepA recognized by DnaK, we tested purified N-terminal RepA deletion derivatives in the co-immunoprecipitation assay, using RepA antiserum, for their ability to associate with DnaK. DnaK interacted with RepA derivatives lacking 25 and 35 N-terminal amino acids (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2 and 3). Interaction of DnaK with the 25-amino acid deletion mutant substantiated the result that mutant could be activated for DNA binding by the DnaK chaperone system (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, no detectable binding was seen between DnaK and a mutant RepA lacking 49 N-terminal amino acids, RepA-(50–286), although that mutant bound DnaJ (Fig. 2 A). This result suggested that there is a DnaK-binding site in RepA in the vicinity of amino acids 36–49 (Fig. 5 B, lane 4). The sequence in that region is: 36RLGVFVPKPSKSKG49. We then made an alanine substitution mutant, RepA-mut3, in which Arg-36, Leu-37, Gly-38, and Val-39 were replaced with alanines by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant was not detectably activated by DnaJ and DnaK, because the amount of DNA binding seen in the absence and presence of the chaperone system was similar (Fig.6). The mutant was activated by ClpA, indicating that the structure of the mutant protein was similar to wild type in being recognized by ClpA and converted to active monomers capable of binding DNA (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the alanine substitutions disrupt a necessary recognition signal. We have studied the interaction of DnaJ and DnaK with RepA to understand how the DnaK chaperone system recognizes a native protein. The experiments to locate DnaJ recognition sites in RepA by co-immunoprecipitation, peptide inhibition, and site-directed mutation identified a DnaJ-binding site in the region of amino acids 180–200. That 20-amino acid region of RepA contains 13 amino acids expected to be found in peptides that bind DnaJ (19Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Google Scholar). The peptide that inhibited the interaction of DnaJ and RepA to the greatest extent, RepA-(180–195), contains nine residues expected to be found in a DnaJ binding motif within a stretch of 13 amino acids (Fig. 3 A). The RepA-(185–200) peptide contains nine expected amino acids in a span of 16 amino acids. However, it inhibited RepA-DnaJ binding significantly less well than the 180–195 peptide. The results presented here show that there is a DnaK-binding site in RepA between amino acids 35 and 49. The probable site in RepA, based on characterization of peptide binding by DnaK by Bukau and co-workers (18Rudiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Google Scholar), consists of a core of five hydrophobic amino acids between residues 37 and 41, LGVFV, and several flanking basic amino acids, Arg-36, Lys-43, and Lys-46. Previous work showed that many peptides that bind DnaJ also bind DnaK (19Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Google Scholar). The observation that DnaK bound RepA with a C-terminal deletion of 102 amino acids but DnaJ did not (Figs. 2 B and5 A), suggests that DnaK can bind to a site or sites in RepA distinct from DnaJ sites. The observation that RepA deleted for the N-terminal 49 amino acids bound DnaJ but not DnaK (Figs. 2 Aand 5 B), indicates that the DnaJ-binding site or sites in RepA are specific for DnaJ and not bound by DnaK. It is possible that the sites identified by the deletion analysis reflected hydrophobic regions exposed because of misfolding of the deletion derivatives. However, both peptide competition experiments and site-directed mutations further suggested that these regions are important for recognition by the DnaJ and DnaK chaperone system. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the targeting of substrates to DnaK by DnaJ (19Rudiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1042-1050Google Scholar). In both, DnaJ initially binds to the substrate through specific DnaJ-binding sites. By the first mechanism, the DnaJ- and DnaK-binding sites on the substrate are one and the same. Binding of DnaK·ATP to the substrate is concurrent with the dissociation of DnaJ from the substrate and the association of DnaJ with DnaK, in a reaction involving DnaJ- and substrate-dependent ATP hydrolysis by DnaK. In the second mechanism, DnaK associates with a different site on the substrate than DnaJ, generating a ternary complex stabilized by substrate-DnaJ, substrate-DnaK, and DnaJ-DnaK interactions following DnaJ- and substrate-dependent ATP hydrolysis by DnaK. Both models suggest that ADP/ATP exchange, stimulated by GrpE, results in conformational changes in DnaK that cause release of the substrate. Our data supports the second mechanism in which RepA recruits the DnaK chaperone system by specifically and separately interacting with DnaJ and DnaK. The number of known natural substrates for the DnaK chaperone system is small and their interaction with DnaJ and DnaK has not been characterized extensively. The DNA replication initiation complex of bacteriophage λ, DnaB-λP-λO-oriλ DNA, is remodeled by the DnaK chaperone system in a reaction involving the release of λP and some λO and resulting in the activation of DnaB helicase and DNA replication (34Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10699-10708Google Scholar). Studies with purified proteins have demonstrated that both λO and λP interact with DnaJ and DnaK (34Alfano C. McMacken R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10699-10708Google Scholar, 35Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Google Scholar, 36Wawrzynow A. Banecki B. Wall D. Liberek K. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19307-19311Google Scholar). The initiator proteins of plasmids F and RK2 are activated and monomerized by DnaJ and DnaK, very likely by a mechanism similar to P1 RepA (37Ishiai M. Wada C. Kawasaki Y. Yura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3839-3843Google Scholar,38Konieczny I. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18483-18488Google Scholar). In the case of the RK2 initiator, the reaction requires an additional molecular chaperone, ClpB (38Konieczny I. Liberek K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18483-18488Google Scholar). The DnaK chaperone system also acts on the heat shock ς factor, ς32, to facilitate its degradation (39Straus D. Walter W. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2202-2209Google Scholar) and in vitroς32 interacts with both DnaJ and DnaK (35Wawrzynow A. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19300-19306Google Scholar, 40Gamer J. Bujard H. Bukau B. Cell. 1992; 69: 833-842Google Scholar). Further work is necessary to establish whether DnaK and DnaJ generally recognize separate sites on specific substrates as suggested by the work presented here with RepA."
https://openalex.org/W2097707410,"The transfection ability of nonviral gene therapy vehicles is generally hampered by untimely lysosomal degradation of internalized DNA. In this study we describe the development of a targeted lysosome disruptive element to facilitate the escape of DNA from the lysosomal compartment, thus enhancing the transfection efficacy, in a cell-specific fashion. Two peptides (INF7 and JTS-1) were tested for their capacity to disrupt liposomes. In contrast to JTS-1, INF7 induced rapid cholesterol-independent leakage (EC50, 1.3 μm). INF7 was therefore selected for coupling to a high affinity ligand for the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPr), K(GalNAc)2, to im- prove its uptake by parenchymal liver cells. Although the parent peptide disrupted both cholesterol-rich and -poor liposomes, the conjugate, INF7-K(GalNAc)2, only induced leakage of cholesterol-poor liposomes. Given that endosomal membranes of eukaryotic cells contain <5% cholesterol, this implies that the conjugate will display a higher selectivity toward endosomal membranes. Although both INF7 and INF7-K(GalNAc)2 were found to increase the transfection efficiency on polyplex-mediated gene transfer to parenchymal liver cells by 30-fold, only INF7-K(GalNAc)2appeared to do so in an ASGPr-specific manner. In mice, INF7-K(GalNAc)2 was specifically targeted to the liver, whereas INF7 was distributed evenly over various organs. In summary, we have prepared a nontoxic cell-specific lysosome disruptive element that improves gene delivery to parenchymal liver cells via the ASGPr. Its high cell specificity and preference to lyse intracellular membranes make this conjugate a promising lead in hepatocyte-specific drug/gene delivery protocols.

The development of a viable nonviral gene delivery system continues to be an important theme in gene therapy (1Niidome T. Urakawa M. Sato H. Takahara Y. Anai T. Hatakayama T. Wada A. Hirayama T.

The packaging of DNA into compact particles, the cellular uptake, the endosomal escape, and unpacking of these particles as well as the subsequent transfer of DNA to the nucleus are considered important steps in this regard (2Kichler A.

Their membrane permeabilizing capacity generally depends on the lipid composition and the pH. Although they are random coil at pH 7.0, these peptides undergo a conformational change into an amphipathic α-helix at pH 5.0 and aggregate into multimeric clusters (11Wyman T.B. Nicol F. Zelphati O.

Subsequently, the clustered helical peptides associate with and/or penetrate endosomal membranes, thereby destabilizing the membrane.

Two fusogenic peptides, INF7, a 23-mer peptide from HA, and JTS-1, an artificial INF7 mimic designed for pH-sensitive helix formation, were studied (10Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P.

Moreover, INF7-K(GalNAc)2, unlike the parental INF7, accumulates efficiently in the liver after in vivo administration and strongly improves the transfer of polyplexed genes to parenchymal liver cells in an ASGPr-dependent fashion.DISCUSSIONThe main objective of this study was to improve nonviral gene delivery by the use of targeted LDEs. As a first step we have tested two HA-derived fusogenic peptides, JTS-1 and INF7, for their lysosome disruptive capacity in calcein-laden liposomes (10Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S.L.C. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar). INF7 was found to induce a rapid and cholesterol-independent leakage of liposomes, whereas JTS-1-induced leakage was much slower and cholesterol-dependent. Moreover, JTS-1 was unable to disrupt cholesterol-poor (<20%) liposomes completely. These findings concur with the studies of Gottschalk et al. (10Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S.L.C. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar), who showed complete leakage of cholesterol-poor liposomes by INF7 compared with only partial leakage by JTS-1 (35%). The differential fusogenic profile of JTS-1 and INF7 is not the result of differences in net negative charge or hydrophobicity of the peptides because the peptides are very similar in that respect. Possibly, INF7 and JTS-1 have a different orientation in liposomal membranes (12Martin I. Pecheur E.I. Ruysschaert J.M. Hoekstra D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9337-9347Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 37Pecheur E.I. Martin I. Ruysschaert J.M. Bienvenue A. Hoekstra D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 3936-3942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Further experiments will be imperative to confirm this hypothesis.In the second step, the most promising peptide, INF-7, was equipped with a homing device to render the peptide specific for parenchymal liver cells. As a homing device we used K(GalNAc)2, which was shown previously to be able to redirect liposomes, lipoproteins, and drugs to liver parenchymal cells (26Valentijn R.A. van der Marel G.A.

The conjugate appeared to be slightly less fusogenic than the parent peptide (1.3 μm versus 6.1 μm). However, the lytic activity of the conjugate was cholesterol-dependent in that it only disrupted cholesterol-poor liposomes. This may be an advantage as K(GalNAc)2-conjugated INF7 is designed to act specifically on the cholesterol-deficient lysosomal membranes of ASGPr-expressing cells. INF7, by contrast, may also be fusogenic at the level of the plasma membrane.The intriguing observation that INF7-K(GalNAc)2-induced leakage depends on the liposome cholesterol content, in contrast to INF7 alone, prompted further study. Lysosome disruptive peptides may facilitate leakage, through pore formation and through a detergent-like solubilization of the membrane (36Parente R.A. Nir S. Szoka Jr., F.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8720-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The differential lytic profile of INF7 and its glycoconjugate suggests that INF7 disrupts membranes via both pathways, one of which predominates in cholesterol-rich membranes and is blocked by the presence of the bulky glycoside moiety. However, the lack of leakage of 125I-trypsin inhibitor from INF7 (glycoconjugate)-treated liposomes points to pore formation as the major pathway of liposome disruption for both INF7 and the glycoconjugated INF7. Rather, steric hindrance of the exposed glycoside group might interfere with the ability of the fusogenic peptide to form pores. This also explains the reduced lytic activity of INF7-K(GalNAc)2 in cholesterol-rich liposomes because the liposomal cholesterol may hamper pore formation by INF7-K(GalNAc)2 caused by steric hindrance of the glycoside group. To confirm this hypothesis, the orientation and distribution of the peptides in the liposomal membrane need to be addressed.The glycoconjugated peptide was designed for ASGPr-directed delivery. Indeed, glycoconjugated INF7 bound to the ASGPr with an affinity of 87 nm, which is about two times lower than K(GalNAc)2 itself. Earlier studies have shown that an affinity of 87 nm for the ASGPr should be sufficient for effective targeting of INF7-K(GalNAc)2 (32Rensen P.C.N. Sliedregt L. Ferns A. Kieviet E. van Rossenberg S.M.W. van Leeuwen S.H. van Berkel T.J.C. Biessen E.A.L. J. Biol.

Biochem. J. 1999; 3: 783-792Crossref Google Scholar).The final goal of this study was to elaborate a targeted LDE for improving nonviral gene transfer. To this end, we have evaluated the effect of the fusogenic peptides on the gene transfer efficiency of an established nonviral gene delivery protocol based on the cationic peptide K8 in mouse parenchymal liver cells (10Gottschalk S. Sparrow J.T. Hauer J. Mims M.P. Leland F.E. Woo S.L.C. Smith L.C. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 448-457PubMed Google Scholar). DNA polyplexed with small sized synthetic oligocations (like K8) may be better for systemic application because the derived condensates generally are smaller and less immunogenic, nonaggregating, and are readily unpacked intracellularly (43McKenzie D.L. Collard W.T. Rice K.G. J. Pept. Res. 1999; 54: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 44Wadhwa M.S. Collard W.T. Adami R.C. McKenzie D.L. Rice K.G. Bioconj. Chem. 1997; 8: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). INF7, INF7-SGSC, and INF7-K(GalNAc)2 led to a substantial, 30-fold, increase in the transfection efficiency of K8·DNA complexes in freshly isolated parenchymal cells. This stimulatory effect was concentration-dependent. Even though in the leakage assay, INF7-K(GalNAc)2 appeared to be 6-fold less potent than INF7, the lower intrinsic activity is compensated for by the enhanced uptake of the targeted peptide, by parenchymal liver cells. However, it should also be kept in mind that liposomal and cellular assays are not fully comparable.The fusogenic activity of INF7-K(GalNAc)2 was abolished completely in the presence of excess GalNAc, which blocks ASGPr-mediated uptake, whereas GlcNAc had no effect on the transfection efficiency. Moreover, INF7-K(GalNAc)2 did not affect the transfection yield in ASGPr-deficient BHK cells, whereas INF7 and INF7-SGSC were equally potent in BHK and mouse parenchymal cells. This underlines that the stimulatory effect of glycoconjugated INF7 is mediated by the ASGPr and will have fewer side effects. In agreement with previous studies, primary parenchymal liver cells are more difficult to transfect than continuous cell lines; the intrinsic transfection efficacy in BHK cells was indeed found to be 10–100-fold higher than in parenchymal cells (45Beck N.B. Sidhu J.S. Omiecinski C.J. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1274-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The observation that INF7-K(GalNAc)2 was completely inactive in BHK cells indicates that non-ASGPr-mediated uptake and the lytic activity of INF7-K(GalNAc)2 are reduced considerably compared with those of INF7 or INF7-SGSC. As our leakage data already showed that the glycoconjugate is less fusogenic, we propose that this is the major contributing factor underlying the reduced stimulatory effect of INF7-K(GalNAc)2 in BHK cells. The actual route of entry of INF7 and INF7-SGSC remains unclear. INF7 and INF7-SGSC may be cointernalized into the target cells, associated with the polyplexes. Because the peptides have only a very weak fusogenic activity at pH 7.4, it is unlikely that they may be stimulatory by facilitating polyplex/plasma membrane fusion. Cellular uptake of the cationic polyplexes may in turn implicate the use of receptor systems, possibly the scavenger receptor class B and CD36 (46Terpstra V. van Amersfoort E.S. van Velzen A.G. Kuiper J. van Berkel T.J.C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1860-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), or alternative pathways such as pinocytosis. INF7-K(GalNAc)2, on the other hand, could be stimulatory by associating with the K8·DNA complex and subsequently promoting whole complex uptake via an ASGPr-mediated pathway. Intracellularly, INF7-K(GalNAc)2 will promote escape of the DNA from the lysosomal compartment.It has been reported that lysosome leakage and membrane disruption may lead to intracellular release of lytic enzymes including proteases, nucleases, and lipases. Although these enzymes are acid hydrolases, with a catalytic optimum near pH 5.0, leakage of these enzymes in the cytoplasm of the cell could promote apoptosis or necrosis (47Zang Y. Beard R.L. Chandraratna R.A.S. Kang J.X. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We show that the peptides are not cytotoxic in parenchymal liver cells.Another important issue in regard of potential in vivo use involves the pharmacokinetics of INF7 and its glycoconjugate. The biodistribution profile in mice shows that INF7-K(GalNAc)2is preferentially taken up by the liver, whereas INF7 is distributed evenly over various organs. In fact, liver uptake of the glycoconjugate is 6-fold higher than that of INF7, indicating that we have developed a hepatocyte-specific LDE for use in vivo.In conclusion, we present a targeted fusogenic peptide, INF7-K(GalNAc)2, which induces lysosomal escape in a receptor-dependent fashion. Its favorable pH- and cholesterol-dependent activity profile makes it even more lysosome-specific than the parental INF7. We envision that INF7-K(GalNAc)2 could be applied to improve the transfection efficacy of hepatic nonviral gene transfer vehicles (25Nishikawa M. Yamauchi M. Morimoto K. Ishida E. Takakura Y. Hashida M. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and of antisense drugs for hepatic genes (42Biessen E.A.L. Vietsch H. Rump E.T. Fluiter K. Kuiper J.

The majority of the amphipathic peptides are derived from viral elements that promote cellular entry and correct intracellular handling. Their membrane permeabilizing capacity generally depends on the lipid composition and the pH. Although they are random coil at pH 7.0, these peptides undergo a conformational change into an amphipathic α-helix at pH 5.0 and aggregate into multimeric clusters (11Wyman T.B. Nicol F. Zelphati O.

The distribution of GPI-anchored fusion yellow fluorescent protein (GPI-YFP) in the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells with different glycolipid compositions was investigated. Cells depleted of glycosphingolipids by inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase activity or cell lines expressing different gangliosides caused by stable transfection of appropriate ganglioside glycosyltransferases or exposed to exogenous GM1 were transfected with GPI-YFP cDNA. The distribution of GPI-YFP fusion protein expressed at the plasma membrane was studied using the membrane-impermeable cross-linking agent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate. Results indicate that GPI-YFP forms clusters at the surface of cells expressing GM3, or cells depleted of glycolipids, or transfected cells expressing mainly GD3 and GT3, or GM1 and GD1a, or mostly GM2, or highly expressing GM1. However, no significant changes in membrane microdomains of GPI-YFP were detected in the different glycolipid environments provided by the membranes of the cell lines under study. On the other hand, wild type CHO-K1 cells exposed to 100 μm GM1 before cross-linking with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate showed a dramatic reduction in the amount of GPI-YFP clusters. These findings clearly indicate that manipulating the glycolipid content of the cellular membrane, just by changing the ganglioside biosynthetic activity of the cell, did not significantly affect the association of GPI-YFP on the cell surface of CHO-K1 cells. The effect of exogenous GM1 gangliosides on GPI-YFP plasma membrane distribution might be a consequence of the ganglioside level reached in plasma membrane and/or the effect of particular ganglioside species (micelles) that lead to membrane architecture and/or dynamic modifications.

The gangliosides are named according to Svennerholm (50Svennerholm L. J. Neurochem. 1963; 10: 613-623Google Scholar).-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) are a heterogeneous class of proteins anchored to the membrane via a post-translational lipid modification, the GPI-moiety. Biosynthesis of the GPI-moiety occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum via a series of enzymatic steps that sequentially add GPI components. GPI-APs are then transported through the Golgi to the trans-Golgi network, where they are sorted to the cell surface (1Chatterjee S. Mayor S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1969-1987Google Scholar). GPI-APs have been found as constituents of the glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomain (GEM) (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar, 3Simons M. Friedrichson T. Schulz J.B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34701-34709Google Scholar), dynamic assemblies of cholesterol, saturated phospholipids, and sphingolipids, characterized by a light buoyant density and resistance to solubilization by Triton X-100 at 4 °C (5Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Google Scholar,6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar). Experiments of direct visualization of GPI-APs using multicolor imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP) variants demonstrated that these proteins segregate progressively in Golgi/trans-Golgi network structures, exclude resident proteins, and exit into particular vesicles before surface delivery in both polarized and nonpolarized cells (7Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Google Scholar). Gangliosides are a large family of sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids (GSLs). They are found in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of nearly all vertebrate cells, but most concentrate in the central nervous system (8Hakomori S. Igarashi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1091-1103Google Scholar). Like GPI-APs, they have also been reported to reside in GEM (6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar, 9Prinetti A. Iwabuchi K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20916-20924Google Scholar, 10Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Google Scholar, 11Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Google Scholar) and to modulate protein distribution in membrane microdomains. Recently, Jacobson and colleagues (12Dietrich C. Volovyk Z.N. Levi M. Thompson N.L. Jacobson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10642-10647Google Scholar) demonstrated that GM1, a monosialoganglioside, reduced the abundance of F-Thy-1, a GPI-AP, in lipid clusters reconstituted in a supported model membrane monolayer. Indeed, Kurzchalia and co-workers (3Simons M. Friedrichson T. Schulz J.B. Pitto M. Masserini M. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3187-3196Google Scholar) reported that exogenously added GM1 displaced GPI-APs from the lipid microdomain in living cells. As a result, it was hypothesized that the wide spectrum of biological effects exerted by gangliosides could be explained by an interaction with signaling molecules or by the influence of the structure of plasma membrane, more specifically on GEM (3Simons M. Friedrichson T. Schulz J.B. Pitto M. Masserini M. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3187-3196Google Scholar, 5Iwabuchi K. Yamamura S. Prinetti A. Handa K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9130-9138Google Scholar). Many approaches have been used to investigate ganglioside functions. Numerous studies, as indicated above, consisted of adding exogenous gangliosides to the culture medium and then examining the cellular responses (13Saqr H.E. Pearl D.K. Yates A.J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 395-411Google Scholar). Glycosphingolipid synthesis inhibitors have also been used to modify levels of endogenous glycolipids to investigate glycolipid function (1Chatterjee S. Mayor S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1969-1987Google Scholar). Prototype inhibitors are PDMP (14Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Wotring L.L. Zipkin R.E. Sivakumar R. Ruggieri J.M. Carson K.G. Ganem B. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 611-621Google Scholar) and its analogous PPPP (15Lee L. Abe A. Shayman J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14662-14669Google Scholar). These two compounds inhibit glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthase activity blocking the efflux of substrate to ganglioside synthesis. Another approach to diminish the concentration of cell surface glycolipids consisted of hydrolyzing them by treatment of cells with endoglycoceramidase (16Ji L. Ito M. Zhang G. Yamagata T. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 343-350Google Scholar), reduction of the neuraminidase-sensitive ganglioside content of cells by stable sialidase expression (17Meuillet E.J. Kroes R. Yamamoto H. Warner T.G. Ferrari J. Mania-Farnell B. George D. Rebbaa A. Moskal J.R. Bremer E.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 234-240Google Scholar), or by modulation of GM1 surface levels by manipulation of plasma membrane sialidase activity in hippocampal neurons in culture (18Rodriguez J.A. Piddini E. Hasegawa T. Miyagi T. Dotti C.G. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 8387-8395Google Scholar). Finally, new strategies such as the targeted disruption or overexpression of genes in the glycolipid biosynthesis pathway or the modification of cellular ganglioside profile by gene transfection of enzymes involved in ganglioside biosynthesis has yielded new insights into the functional and biological roles of glycolipids, particularly ganglioside (19Tifft C.J. Proia R.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1249-1258Google Scholar, 20Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. Daniotti J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 465-472Google Scholar, 21Fukumoto S. Mutoh T. Hasegawa T. Miyazaki H. Okada M. Goto G. Furukawa K. Urano T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5832-5838Google Scholar). Although there is a large number of studies on ganglioside function, we have no evidence so far of a comprehensive analysis of the effects mediated by endogenous, exogenous, and depletion of glycosphingolipid in a same cell system. Using a chemical cross-linking approach and density gradient centrifugation in sucrose, in the present work we investigated the effect of particular gangliosides, synthesized using the endogenous machinery of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells, on the distribution of a GPI-AP in plasma membrane. Furthermore, we also investigated the distribution of GPI-AP in plasma membrane of CHO-K1 cell lines depleted of glycolipids by inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase activity or exposed to exogenous GM1 ganglioside. Our data suggest a differential effect of gangliosides on the distribution of the GPI-AP. At least five different sets of endogenously expressed gangliosides had not significant effect on GPI-AP distribution in plasma membrane. On the other hand, exogenous application of GM1 ganglioside displaced GPI-AP from lipid domains in CHO-K1 cells. Clones expressing different ganglioside glycosyltransferases were already obtained in our laboratory from CHO-K1 cells. The following cell clones were used: wild type CHO-K1 cells (ATCC); clone 2, a stable CMP-NeuAc:GM3 sialyltransferase (Sial-T2) transfectant expressing the ganglioside GD3 (20Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. Daniotti J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 465-472Google Scholar, 22Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Giraudo C.G. Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1711-1720Google Scholar); clone 3, a stable UDP-GalNAc:LacCer/GM3/GD3N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (GalNAc-T) transfectant mostly expressing gangliosides GM3, and GM2 (23Giraudo C.G. Rosales Fritz V.M. Maccioni H.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 633-640Google Scholar) and, to a lesser extent, GM1 and GD1a and clone 4, a double-stable transfectant expressing GalNAc-T and UDP-Gal:GA2/GM2/GD2/galactosyltransferase (Gal-T2). Cells from the last clone characterize by having increased consumption of GM2 for synthesis of GM1 and GD1a. Inhibition of glycolipid synthesis with PPPP (Matreya Inc.) was carried out as described (23Giraudo C.G. Rosales Fritz V.M. Maccioni H.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 633-640Google Scholar). Wild type CHO-K1 cells in culture were treated for 4 days with 2 μm PPPP added to the culture medium. Inhibition of glycolipid synthesis was monitored by analyzing the cellular ganglioside content by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with 1 μg/dish of plasmids carrying cDNAs coding for the total sequence of the yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) fused to a GPI attachment signal (GPI-YFP) or for the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) fused to the cyan fluorescence protein (VSVG-CFP) or for the total sequence of GAP-43 using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as DNA carriers, essentially according to the manufacturers' recommendations. GPI-YFP and VSVG-CFP fusion constructs were provided by P. Keller, Max-Plank Institute, Dresden, Germany (7Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Google Scholar). The cDNA containing the full coding sequence for GAP-43 was amplified in our laboratory by reverse transcription PCR using, as template, mRNA obtained from mouse brain. The amplified full-length cDNA was subcloned into the pCR 3.1 TA vector (Invitrogen). 15 h later the cells were used for cross-linking experiments (as indicated below) or washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and harvested with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.25 m sucrose for Western blot assays. Wild type CHO-K1 cells were washed with cold PBS and isolated by scraping. Samples were treated with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mNa2CO3, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (TNE buffer) at 4 °C for 1 h and then centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was removed, and the pellet (insoluble fraction) was resuspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer. Proteins from soluble and insoluble fractions were precipitated with chloroform:methanol (1:4 v/v). The pellets were resuspended in Laemmli buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Wild type CHO-K1 cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of TNE lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. Lysates were centrifuged for 10 h at 150,000 × g at 4 °C on continuous sucrose gradients (5–35%) in TNE buffer without Triton X-100. 12 fractions were collected from the bottom of the sucrose gradient with a fraction collector. Proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, resolved by electrophoresis through 4–20% SDS-PAGE (Novex Tris-glycine gels, Invitrogen) and later analysis by Western blot using the corresponding antibodies. Protein bands in nitrocellulose membranes were visualized by Ponceau S staining and quantified with the computer software Scion Image. Sucrose concentration in each fraction was determined measuring the refractive index (Abbé refractometer, CEQUIMAP, Facultad de Ciencias Quı́micas, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba). Wild type CHO-K1 cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free DMEM containing 100 μm GM1 (Sygen, TRB Pharma; kindly provided by Dr. G. Nores, Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina). To remove excess lipid, cells were washed extensively with PBS containing 0.2% BSA. Then, cells were subjected to chemical cross-linking (see below), SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting. To evaluate the ganglioside association, cells were exposed to 100 μm GM1 in DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C, washed extensively with PBS containing 0.2% BSA, and scraped. Cells were pelleted by brief centrifugation, and lipids were extracted from the cell pellet with chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v). To evaluate the trypsin-stable pool, cells were exposed to 100 μm GM1 for 1 h at 37 °C, washed extensively with PBS containing 0.2% BSA, and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with PBS containing 0.1% trypsin (3Simons M. Friedrichson T. Schulz J.B. Pitto M. Masserini M. Kurzchalia T.V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3187-3196Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted and lipids extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v). Lipid purification and chromatography analysis were carried out as indicated below. Gangliosides were visualized by staining with orcinol. We essentially used the procedure of cross-linking described by Friedrichson and Kurzchalia (25Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated at 4 °C with 0.5 mmbis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3, Pierce Chemical Co.) for 45 min. Cross-linking was quenched by the addition of 50 mm glycine for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with PBS, collected, and pelleted by 5-min centrifugation at 9,000 ×g. Proteins from pellets were resolved by electrophoresis through 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar) for 1 h at 300 mA. Protein bands in nitrocellulose membranes were visualized by Ponceau S staining. For immunoblotting, nonspecific binding sites on the nitrocellulose membrane were blocked with 5% defatted dry milk or with 2.5% BSA and 2.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40 in Tris-buffered saline (400 mm NaCl, 100 mmTris-HCl pH 7.5 buffer), depending on the antibody. Anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used at a dilution of 1:800. Anti-GAP-43 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) polyclonal antibody was used at a dilution of 1:200. Bands were detected by protein A coupled to horseradish peroxidase combined with the chemiluminescence detection kit (Western Lightning, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Kodak Biomax MS films. The molecular weights were calculated based on calibrated standards (Invitrogen) run in every gel. The relative contribution of individual bands was calculated using the computer software Scion Image on scanned films of low exposure images. The statistical analysis was carried out using the Newman-Keuls test from the Statistica software. Briefly, cells in culture (3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were labeled with 40 μCi/ml[lsqb]3H]Gal, PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 34.6 Ci/mmol) for 18 h. For PPPP-treated cells, [3H]Gal was added to the culture medium 18 h before harvesting the cells. After washing with cold PBS, cells were scraped from the plate and pelleted by centrifugation. Lipids were extracted from the cell pellet with chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) and freed from water-soluble contaminants by passing through a Sephadex G-25 column. The lipid extract was supplemented with appropriate amounts of standard gangliosides and chromatographed on HPTLC plates (Merck) using chloroform:methanol and 0.25% CaCl2 (60:36:8 v/v) as solvent. Standard gangliosides were visualized by exposing the plate to iodine vapors. Routinely, 15,000–20,000 cpm was spotted on each lane. Radioactive gangliosides were visualized using a Fuji Photo Film Bio Imagen analyzer or visualized by fluorography after dipping the plate in 0.4% melted 2,5-diphenyloxazole in 2-methylnaphthalene and exposure to a radiographic film at −70 °C, usually for 4–6 days (20Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. Daniotti J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 465-472Google Scholar). To analyze the pattern of gangliosides in fractions obtained from sucrose gradients, cells in culture (3 × 105cells/35-mm dish) were labeled with 2 μCi/ml of [14C]Gal (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 329.5 mCi/mmol) for 22 h. Then, cells were lysed and subjected to centrifugation on a continuous sucrose gradient as indicated above. To determinate the ganglioside content of each fraction, they were subjected to Folch-Pi partition (27Folch-Pi J. Arsove S. Meath J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 191: 819-831Google Scholar). The resulting aqueous phases were purified further to eliminate Triton X-100 and sucrose by passing through DEAE-Sephadex and Sep-Pak C18 cartridge columns (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Lipid extracts were subjected to HPTLC, and gangliosides were visualized using a Fuji Photo Film Bio Imagen analyzer or by fluorography. Cells in culture (3 × 105 cells/35-mm dish) were labeled with 2 μCi/ml [14C]Gal and then transfected with 1 μg/dish of plasmid carrying the cDNA coding for GPI-YFP. After 24 h, cells were washed and treated with 0.2 ml of TNE buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 20 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 400 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatants were mixed with protein G-Sepharose beads and precleared by stirring for 30 min at 4 °C. Then, supernatants were incubated with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody and protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C for 4 h. After a brief centrifugation, a supernatant was recovered, and beads were washed three times with TNE buffer and 1% Triton X-100 and once with TNE buffer without Triton X-100. Lipids from the supernatant and beads were purified, subjected to HPTLC analysis, and visualized as described above. Cells from clone 4 transiently expressing GPI-YFP were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 2 units/ml neuraminidase type V from Clostridium perfringes (Sigma). After this, cells were washed with cold PBS and subjected to cross-linking experiments with BS3 as indicated above. The activity of the neuraminidase treatment was checked in parallel by metabolic labeling of glycolipid with [3H]Gal for 15 h and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 2.0 units/ml neuraminidase type V. After the incubation period, cells were washed with PBS, and lipids were extracted and chromatographed following the procedure as indicated above. Previously, we have established several CHO-K1 cell lines, which express different gangliosides by transfection of GalNAc-T, Gal-T2, or Sial-T2 glycosyltransferases. Wild type CHO-K1 cells express predominantly the ganglioside GM3, as shown in the pattern of radioactive lipids metabolically labeled with [3H]Gal for 18 h (Fig.1, WT). Cells stably transfected with the cDNA encoding the chicken Sial-T2 under the control of the human elongation factor promoter (clone 2) (20Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. Daniotti J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 465-472Google Scholar, 22Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Giraudo C.G. Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1711-1720Google Scholar) synthesize mostly GD3 and GT3, accumulate LacCer, and practically do not synthesize GM3 (Fig. 1, clone 2). On the other hand, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the human full-length GalNAc-T cDNA (clone 3) (23Giraudo C.G. Rosales Fritz V.M. Maccioni H.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 633-640Google Scholar) synthesize the a-series ganglioside GM2 and, to a lesser extent, GM1 and GD1a because of the constitutive expression in these cells of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of GM1 and GD1a (28Rosales Fritz V.M. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 153-158Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, clone 3). Subsequent transfection of mouse Gal-T2 to clone 3 led to the isolation of a new stable cell clone, clone 4 (Fig. 1, clone 4). This cell clone is characterized by having increased consumption of GM2 for synthesis of GM1 and GD1a. To get cells with a reduced content of all glycosphingolipid classes, wild type CHO-K1 cells were treated with PPPP, a potent inhibitor of ceramide glucosyltransferase and hence of synthesis of GlcCer and of more complex glycolipids (20Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. Daniotti J.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 465-472Google Scholar, 23Giraudo C.G. Rosales Fritz V.M. Maccioni H.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 633-640Google Scholar, 29Li R. Manela J. Kong Y. Ladisch S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34213-34223Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to 2 μm PPPP in the culture medium for 4 days led to a 90–95% decrease of GM3 and LacCer content with respect to control cells (Fig. 1, WT-PPPP). For exogenous GM1 administration, wild type CHO-K1 cells were exposed to 100 μm GM1 for 1 h in serum-free medium at 37 °C, and then the cells were washed with BSA solution to remove excess GM1. Lipids were extracted from the cells, chromatographed on HPTLC, and revealed by orcinol staining. As indicated above (Fig. 1,WT), CHO-K1 cells express predominantly the ganglioside GM3 (Fig. 2, WT, 0 μmGM1); however, a considerable incorporation of GM1 (approximately 3-fold the amount of endogenous GM3) was observed when cells were incubated with the exogenous lipid (Fig. 2,WT, 100 μmGM1). After cells were washed with BSA solution, ∼32% of total associated GM1 could be released by trypsin treatment (not shown). The trypsin-stable pool of GM1 likely corresponds to the molecules inserted into the plasma membrane. Wild type CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding a fusion protein containing a GPI-anchored signal, a GEM marker (7Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Google Scholar). The fusion protein contains an endoplasmic reticulum import signal, the total sequence of the YFP, and a consensus N-glycosylation site fused to a GPI attachment signal (GPI-YFP). Also, wild type CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding the non-GEM marker VSVG fused to the CFP (7Keller P. Toomre D. Diaz E. White J. Simons K. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2001; 3: 140-149Google Scholar). GPI-YFP and VSVG-CFP expression was confirmed by Western blotting with an antibody directed to the fluorescent protein. The antibody detected the GPI-YFP as two bands, one of ∼39 kDa and the other of approximately 37 kDa (Fig.3 A). To evaluate the nature of the GPI-YFP fraction present in plasma membrane, cell surface proteins were biotinylated with the water-soluble agent Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin (EZ-Link biotinylation reagent, Pierce Chemical Co.), purified with streptavidin affinity chromatography, and analyzed by Western blotting (30Busch G. Hoder D. Reutter W. Tauber R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 50: 257-262Google Scholar). Results revealed that the fraction of GPI-YFP with high molecular mass (39 kDa) was the main species present in plasma membrane, indicating that this fraction of expressed GPI-YFP likely corresponded to the fully glycosylated form (results not shown). On the other hand, the analysis of VSVG-CFP expression by Western blotting revealed a band of the expected molecular mass (∼90 kDa) (Fig. 3 A). The subcellular distribution of GPI-YFP in CHO-K1 cells included a pool at the cell surface and another one with a juxtanuclear distribution (Fig. 3 B). This compartment was identified as the Golgi complex by colocalization with the medial Golgi marker, mannosidase II (not shown), as described previously for other epithelial cells (31Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Google Scholar). VSVG-CFP was distributed evenly at the cell surface of the transfected cells (Fig. 3 B). To characterize further whether GPI-YFP behaved appropriately as a GEM marker and VSVG-CFP as a non-GEM marker, we determined their insolubility in Triton X-100 at 4 °C (6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar). As expected, the GEM marker (GPI-YFP) was 67% insoluble, whereas the non-GEM marker (VSVG-CFP) was less than 22% insoluble (Fig. 3 C). Additionally, we also examined the distribution of both proteins in sucrose density gradients (Fig. 4). Such a procedure should separate lipid-rich components from the bulk of the Triton X-100-insoluble material in cell lysates, which would include nuclear remnants, cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix, and any component that binds to such insoluble materials. The insoluble components should pellet, whereas proteins and lipids resistant to Triton X-100 extraction should band at a low density (2Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Google Scholar). Basically, homogenates from transfected CHO-K1 cells were extracted with Triton X-100 at 4 °C, and lysates were subjected to continuous sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, fractionation, and detection of the fusion proteins and protein marker by Western blotting. GPI-YFP was highly concentrated in low density fractions codistributing with GAP-43, a recognized GEM marker (6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Google Scholar, 32Arni S. Keilbaugh S.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28478-28485Google Scholar, 33El-Husseini A.E. Craven S.E. Brock S.C. Bredt D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44984-44992Google Scholar) Essentially the same distribution patterns in sucrose gradient were obtained for GPI-YFP from wild type CHO-K1 cells and clones 2, 3, and 4 (results not shown). In contrast, VSVG-CFP distributed in higher density fractions, behaving essentially as Triton X-100-soluble proteins (2Brown D.A"
https://openalex.org/W2025010174,"Human bile acid-CoA:amino acidN-acyltransferase (hBAT), an enzyme catalyzing the conjugation of bile acids with the amino acids glycine or taurine has significant sequence homology with dienelactone hydrolases and other α/β hydrolases. These enzymes have a conserved catalytic triad that maps onto the mammalian BATs at residues Cys-235, Asp-328, and His-362 of the human sequence, albeit that the hydrolases contain a serine instead of a cysteine. In the present study, the function of the putative catalytic triad of hBAT was examined by chemical modification with the cysteine alkylating reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and by site-directed mutagenesis of the triad residues followed by enzymology studies of mutant and wild-type hBATs. Treatment with NEM caused inactivation of wild-type hBAT. However, preincubation of wild-type hBAT with the substrate cholyl-CoA before NEM treatment prevented loss of N-acyltransferase activity. Substitution of His-362 or Asp-328 with alanine results in inactivation of hBAT. Although substitution of Cys-235 with serine generated an hBAT mutant with lower N-acyltransferase activity, it substantially increased the bile acid-CoA thioesterase activity compared with wild type. In summary, data from this study support the existence of an essential catalytic triad within hBAT consisting of Cys-235, His-362, and Asp-328 with Cys-235 serving as the probable nucleophile and thus the site of covalent attachment of the bile acid molecule.

In humans, the majority of bile acids (BAs) 1The abbreviations used are: BA(s), bile acid(s); BAT, bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry; LC-ESI-MS-MRM, liquid chromatography-ESI-MS-multiple reaction monitoring; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight; IPTG, isopropyl- 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside synthesized by the liver are conjugated with glycine or taurine, a reaction that favors their excretion into bile (1Zouboulis-Vafiadis I.

Physiol. 1998; 274: G370-G375Google Scholar). Conjugation also promotes absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K in the acidic environment of the small intestine by lowering the pK a of bile acids and hence maintaining BA solubility. Conjugation of bile acids with amino acids occurs in two steps. In the first, BAs form a thioester with CoA, catalyzed by BA-CoA ligase. In the second step, or amidation reaction, either glycine or taurine is conjugated to BA-CoA to form a BA amidate and CoA is displaced. The amidation reaction (ReactionFR1) is catalyzed by bile acid CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAT). BAT has been purified from the livers of rats (4Killenberg P.G. Jordan J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1005-1010Google Scholar), cows (5Vessey D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2059-2063Google Scholar), chickens (6Czuba B. Vessey D.A. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 263-266Google Scholar), and humans (7Kimura M. Okuno E. Inada J. Ohyama H. Kido R. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 637-645Google Scholar, 8Johnson M. Barnes S. Kwakye J. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10227-10233Google Scholar). The human (9Falany C.N. Johnson M.R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Google Scholar) and mouse BAT (10Falany C.N. Fortinberry H. Leiter E.H. Barnes S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1139-1148Google Scholar) genes have been cloned, and the enzymatically active recombinant enzymes expressed in bacteria. A putative rat BAT (Kan-1) has been described (11Furutani M. Arii S. Higashitsuji H. Mise M. Fukumoto M. Takano S. Nakayama H. Imamura M. Fujita J. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 203-208Google Scholar); however, the expression and enzymatic characterization of Kan-1 have not been reported. Sequence similarity searches at the NCBI BLAST server (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/) against non-redundant protein data base using the iterative algorithm PSI-BLAST (12Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Google Scholar) have detected significant similarity of BAT to dienelactone hydrolase and other α/β hydrolases of known structure. The α/β hydrolase fold is shared by several enzymes that apparently have diverged from a common ancestor. Despite their different catalytic functions, these enzymes all contain a conserved nucleophile-histidine-acid catalytic triad with the histidine being a completely conserved amino acid and the nucleophile and acid loops accommodating more than one type of amino acid (13Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-221Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments also revealed that hBAT and other BATs have high homology (above or equal to 40%) with peroxisomal, mitochondrial, and cytosolic long chain acyl-CoA thioesterases or acyl-CoA thioesterases. The conserved amino acid residues are indicated in Fig. 1. Using mutation analysis, Huhtinen et al. established the serine-histidine-aspartic acid triad in CTE-I (14Huhtinen K. O' Byrne J. Lindquist P.J.G. Contreras J.A. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3424-3432Google Scholar). The importance of these residues had been suggested by previous site-directed mutagenesis experiments, and the enzyme reaction mechanism speculated (15Pazirandeh M. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20946-20952Google Scholar, 16Witkowski A. Naggert J. Wessa B. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18514-18519Google Scholar, 17Witkowski A. Naggert J. Witkowska H.E. Randhawa Z.I. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18488-18492Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the active site-serine was substituted with a cysteine the thioesterase II, a fatty acyl-thioester hydrolase, was converted to an acyltransferase (18Witkowski A. Witkowska H.E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 379-383Google Scholar). Thus, we have hypothesized that hBAT utilizes a catalytic triad composed of Cys-235, His-362, and Asp-328 with Cys-235 as the nucleophile. In this report we describe experiments to support the hypothesis that Cys-235, His-362, and Asp-328 are essential for theN-acyltransferase activity of hBAT and form the catalytic triad with Cys-235 serving as the nucleophile. Replacement of Cys-235 by serine converted hBAT from an N-acyltransferase into a bile acid-CoA thioesterase, which is consistent with a reaction mechanism based on the formation of a bile acid-hBAT covalent intermediate via a thioester bond. These results also demonstrate the close relationship between acyl-CoA thioesterases andN-acyltransferases. Cholic acid was purchased from Sigma. NEM was from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, Texas). [2-3H]Taurine (29 Ci/mmol) and [2-3H]glycine (10 Ci/mmol) were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) and Amersham Biosciences, respectively. QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit and QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Centricon Centrifugal Filter Devices were obtained from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Promega (Madison, WI). Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridges were purchased from Waters (Milford, MA). pET-21a(+) and Bugbuster protein extraction reagent were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). The Rapid Ligation Kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. SoftLink Avidin Resin was purchased from Promega. Bacterial cytosol containing wild-type hBAT (150 μg of total protein) was incubated with NEM (680 μm) for 2, 5, and 10 min at 37 °C. At the end of the incubations, dithiothreitol (DTT; 680 μm) was added to inactivate residual NEM.N-acyltransferase activity was then determined following addition of cholyl-CoA (0.5 mm), [2-3H]taurine (0.1 mm) and phosphate buffer (100 mm K2HPO4, pH 8.25) and incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The total reaction volume was 100 μl. Different concentrations of NEM (50, 100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 μm) were incubated with bacterial cytosol containing wild-type hBAT (150 μg of total protein) for 10 min at 37 °C.N-Acyltransferase activity was then determined as previously described. Bacterial cytosol containing wild-type hBAT (150 μg of total protein) was preincubated with cholyl-CoA (1 mm) in phosphate buffer for 0, 2, and 5 min at 37 °C, and then NEM (680 μm) was added. The mixture was incubated for a further 10 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of DTT (680 μm).N-Acyltransferase activity was determined with the addition of [2-3H]taurine (0.05 μCi, 0.1 mm). The total reaction volume was 120.5 μl. Cholyl-CoA was chemically synthesized as described previously (19Johnson M. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 360-365Google Scholar), using a modification of the method of Shah and Staple (20Shah P.P. Staple E. Steroids. 1968; 12: 571-576Google Scholar). Cholyl-CoA was first separated from the reaction mixture by three extractions with five reaction volumes of ether in a separating funnel. The aqueous phase was collected and purified by absorption onto Sep-Pak Plus C18 cartridges. After the sample was loaded, the cartridge was washed with 3 × 3 ml of 20% methanol in double distilled H2O. Elution was carried out with 10 mm NH4HCO3 in methanol. After removal of the elution buffer by evaporation into air, cholyl-CoA was dissolved in double-distilled H2O, and its concentration determined spectrophotometrically. An ε259 nm = 16,800m−1 cm−1 was used to calculate the concentration. Since it was difficult to detect low levels of cholate contamination in cholyl-CoA by high pressure liquid chromatography-based procedures, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to confirm the purity of the synthesized cholyl-CoA. Analysis was carried out on a PE-Sciex (Concord, Ontario, Canada) API III triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The sample was introduced into the mass spectrometer via the electrospray ionization interface with an ionizing needle voltage of –4900 V and an orifice potential of –60 V. Negative ion spectra were recorded over a range ofm/z values from 190 to 2000. The purity of the cholyl-CoA preparation by this analysis was estimated to be better than 99.5%. The full-length cDNA for hBAT was cloned into the pKK233–2 vector as described previously (9Falany C.N. Johnson M.R. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19375-19379Google Scholar). Plasmid pET-21a(+)/hBAT was constructed by first amplifying hBAT coding sequence by PCR with pKK233–2/hBAT as template DNA. Restriction enzyme sites NdeI and XhoI were generated at the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. The PCR products were then digested with restriction enzymes NdeI and XhoI. The resulting fragment, containing the hBAT coding sequence, was then ligated into the similarly digested pETGagbiotinHis. The plasmid pETGagbiotinHis is a modified version of pET-21a(+) containing the coding sequence for a viral gag protein and a biotinylation tag. 2M. Sakalian, unpublished results. This peptide tag serves as the substrate for site-specific biotinylation by the biotin ligase BirA (21Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Google Scholar). Digestion with NdeI and XhoI excised the gag sequence leaving behind the biotinylation tag coding sequence to be fused to the 3′ end of the hBAT coding sequence. A QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used for all the mutations in this study. The expression plasmid pKK233–2/hBAT or pET-21a(+)/hBAT was used as the template for PCR. Oligonucleotides used for the mutagenesis are shown in Table I with the altered nucleotides underlined. Following PCR, the parental DNA template was removed by DpnI endonuclease digestion and the remaining PCR products transformed intoEscherichia coli XL1-Blue cells. Colonies were selected and characterized by DNA sequence analysis, and each plasmid contained the correct mutation.Table IOligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis to produce the C235S, H362A, and D328A hBAT mutantsCys-235 → Ser (TGT→TCT)FP5′-GGCGTTGGGGTAGTCTCTGTATCTCAAGGAGTACAGAT GG-3′RP5′-CCAATCTGTACTCCTTGAGATACAGAGACTACCCCAAC GCC-3′Asp-328 → Ala (GAT→GCT)FP5′-GGAGAAGGTGCTAAGACTATCAACAGC-3′RP5′-GCTGTTGATAGTCTTAGCACCTTCTCC-3′His-362 → Ala (CAC→GCC)FP5′-GGGGCAGGCGCCCTGATAGAACCTCCC-3′RP5′-GGGAGGTTCTATCAGGGCGCCTGCCCC-3′The altered nucleotides are underlined. Open table in a new tab The altered nucleotides are underlined. Plasmids were transformed into competent E. coli. XL1-Blue or BL21 cells (containing the BirA expression vector birA/pACYC184). The cells were grown in 400 ml of Luria broth containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), or for expression of biotinylated enzyme both ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (10 μg/ml) in a 2-liter flask at 37 °C with shaking. Isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm or 0.4 mm along with biotin (50 μm in dimethyl sulfoxide) when the cells had grown to anA 600 of ∼0.6. The incubation temperature was decreased to 30 °C, and cells were harvested 4 h later by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in Bugbuster protein extraction reagent using 5 ml of BugBuster reagent per gram of wet cell paste and 1 μl (25 units) of Benzonase per ml of the resuspension. The cell suspension was incubated on a shaking platform at a slow setting for 20 min at room temperature. The insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction was assayed for N-acyltransferase activity and stored at –70 °C. Prepared cell extract (25 ml) was mixed with an ATP regeneration system composed of creatine phosphate (80 mm), creatine phosphokinase (500 μg/ml), and ATP (5 mm) and then loaded onto a Softlink avidin column (3 ml bed volume) equilibrated with Bugbuster protein extraction reagent (24 ml). The ATP regeneration system was used to separate hBAT from the GroEL-hBAT complex since bacterial GroEL binding to hBAT was always a problem for obtaining pure hBAT (data not shown). The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8, 15 ml). The target protein was eluted with 10 mm biotin in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8, 6 ml). The column was allowed to incubate for 15 min before 1-ml fractions were collected. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). TheN-acyltransferase activity assay monitors the formation of bile acid-3H-amino acid conjugates (19Johnson M. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 360-365Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained cholyl-CoA (0.25 mm), [2-3H]taurine or [2-3H]glycine (0.1 μCi, 2.5 mm), and K2HPO4 (100 mm), pH 8.25. The reaction was started by the addition of enzyme preparation to the reaction mixture and continued for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of KH2PO4 (100 mm) pH 2.0, containing 1% SDS and n-butanol (19Johnson M. Barnes S. Diasio R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 360-365Google Scholar). The reaction products were separated from unreacted taurine or glycine by extraction into the n-butanol. Aliquots of the butanol phase were mixed with scintillation mixture, and the radioactivity determined in a Packard (Downers Grove, IL) 1900CA liquid scintillation counter. The assay was based on the method described previously (14Huhtinen K. O' Byrne J. Lindquist P.J.G. Contreras J.A. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3424-3432Google Scholar). The buffer contained 200 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Hepes, and 0.05 mm DTNB (5, 5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)). Substrates cholyl-CoA and glycine were mixed with the buffer prior to enzyme addition. The total reaction volume was 1 ml. Thioesterase activity was measured by the increasing absorbance at 412 nm. Cholyl-CoA (50 μm) and glycine or taurine (2.5 mm) were incubated with wild-type or mutant hBAT (1 μg) in K2HPO4 (100 mm), pH 8.25, at 37 °C for 5 min. The total reaction volume was 100 μl. The reaction products were extracted with 100 μl of n-butanol by vortexing for 1 min and quantitated by LC-ESI-MS-MRM. An online reverse phase column (RP-300 C8, 4.6 × 100 mm) was used. Buffer A was 10 mm ammonium acetate and buffer B was 10 mm ammonium acetate in 90% acetonitrile. The product was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of buffer B (0–100%) and introduced into the electrospray ionization interface in the negative ion mode. The parent ion/daughter ion combinations (m/z 407/343 for cholate;m/z 464/74 for glycocholate; andm/z 514/124 for taurocholate) were monitored to detect the formation of cholate, glycocholate, and taurocholate. A linear peak area-response curve was generated with standards containing known concentrations of cholate, glycocholate, and taurocholate. The estimated amounts of reaction products, cholate, glycocholate, and taurocholate were determined by comparison to the standard response curve. The apparent K m andV max for bile acid-CoA thioesterase activity for wild-type and C235A mutant hBAT were estimated using linear regression analysis of a Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot. The results are presented as the means ± S.E. Comparisons of theK m values and V max values were carried out using a pooled t test. The polypeptide bands observed in Coomassie Blue-stained, SDS-PAGE gels of affinity-purified hBAT were subjected to tryptic peptide finger printing. Following trypsin digestion and recovery of the peptides, they were evaporated to dryness and then reconstituted in 10 μl of 50% aqueous acetonitrile:5% formic acid. An aliquot (1 μl) was mixed with 9 μl of a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% aqueous acetonitrile:0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mixture (1 μl) was spotted onto a MALDI target plate and allowed to crystallize. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on an Applied Biosystems Voyager Elite time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The resulting mass spectrometry data was deisotoped, and significant ions submitted for analysis using the MASCOT software program (available at www.matrixscience.com). To investigate if cysteine residues are critical to hBAT enzyme activity, bacterial cytosol containing wild-type hBAT was incubated with NEM, a cysteine residue alkylation reagent, for 2, 5, and 10 min at 37 °C. DTT was then added to react with the residual NEM, andN-acyltransferase activities were assayed. To confirm the hBAT inactivation by NEM modification in different time periods, in a separate experiment different concentrations of NEM were incubated with bacterial cytosol containing wild-type hBAT, andN-acyltransferase activities were similarly determined. Fig.2 A shows that NEM incubation with wild-type hBAT caused a rapid decrease ofN-acyltransferase activity. Over a 10 min period, more than 90% of activity was lost. Wild-type hBAT without NEM incubation was used as a control and had no loss of activity. Fig. 2 B shows the effect of increasing NEM concentrations onN-acyltransferase activity. At 200 μm, more than 90% of the activity was lost. Since NEM modification caused loss of N-acyltransferase activity, one or more of the cysteine residues in hBAT may be critical for enzyme activity and one Cys residue could be the active site. The latter idea would be supported if the substrate, cholyl-CoA, can prevent NEM-induced loss of hBAT activity by reacting with this cysteine residue. Cholyl-CoA was preincubated with cytosol containing hBAT for 0, 2, and 5 min at 37 °C. NEM was added at the end of the incubation, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min. DTT was then added to react with the residual NEM, andN-acyltransferase activity was assayed. Preincubation of cytosol containing hBAT with its substrate, bile acid-CoA (cholyl-CoA), before the addition of NEM preserved ∼50% of BAT activity (Fig.3). As a first step to test the hypothesis that hBAT has a catalytic triad, both His-362 and Asp-328 were separately mutated to alanine. In addition, Cys-235 was mutated to a serine residue, since serine is the nucleophile for the related enzymes (Fig. 1). As shown in Table I, the codons TGT, CAC, and GAT, which code for Cys-235, His-362, and Asp-328, respectively, were changed to the codons TCT, GCC, and GCT, which code for Ser, Ala, and Ala, respectively. These hBAT mutants, along with wild-type hBAT, were expressed in bacteria. Expression levels were similar in each case. Fig.4 A shows the IPTG-induced overexpression of the C235S mutant and wild-type hBAT. In both cases, the major IPTG-induced protein bands were identified as hBAT (50 kDa) and biotin ligase (∼30 kDa) by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of their tryptic peptides. Each hBAT was purified with the Softlink avidin column to homogeneity based on SDS-PAGE (Fig.4 B). The catalytic activities of these mutant and wild-type enzymes were tested using cholyl-CoA and taurine or glycine as the substrates. NoN-acyltransferase activity was detected from either the H362A or D328A mutants. However, the C235S mutant displayed substantial bile acid-CoA thioesterase activity according to the spectrophotometric assay (data not shown). In ∼13 min, all of the substrate was hydrolyzed based on the expected absorbance (calculated from ε = 13,600 m−1 cm−1 for 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) (14Huhtinen K. O' Byrne J. Lindquist P.J.G. Contreras J.A. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3424-3432Google Scholar). Since 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) would inactivate wild-type hBAT by reacting with its cysteine residues (data not shown), LC-ESI-MS-MRM analysis was used for comparison of both the C235S mutant and wild-type hBAT for N-acyltransferase and thioesterase activities. LC-ESI-MS-MRM analysis revealed that the C235S variant of hBAT has lower N-acyltransferase activity compared with wild type; however, an increase in the rate of appearance of cholate, especially when glycine was used as the second substrate, was observed providing evidence of thioesterase activity (Fig.5). The thioesterase activity of C235S hBAT was then characterized in kinetic assays. ItsK m was 27.46 ± 1.57 μm and itsV max was 18.58 ± 0.39 nmol/min/μg, while wild-type hBAT had a K m of 50.02 ± 2.12 μm and V max of 1.48 ± 0.04 nmol/min/μg. These differences were statistically significant (p < 0.01). In the present study we have obtained evidence to support the protein modeling result and the hypothesis that hBAT utilizes a catalytic triad composed of residues Cys-235, His-362, and Asp-328 with Cys-235 acting as the nucleophile. If, indeed, hBAT uses this catalytic triad, the catalytic mechanism of hBAT may follow the classical charge-relay mechanism (Fig. 6) shared by serine proteases (23Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Google Scholar) and thioesterases proposed by Pazirandeh et al. (15Pazirandeh M. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20946-20952Google Scholar). The negative charge from the carboxyl ion of Asp-328 is transferred to His-362 and then to Cys-235 to enhance the power of the nucleophile. In this process, a tetrahedral intermediate 2and one acyl-enzyme intermediate 3 are formed (Fig. 6). Evidence for the catalytic triad, especially Cys-235 as the nucleophile, was obtained using several experimental approaches. The enzyme can be inactivated by a cysteine-specific alkylation NEM, suggesting that one or more cysteine residues are important for the enzyme activity. Cholyl-CoA preincubation before NEM addition prevented 50% of such a loss, suggesting that occupation of the critical cysteine by an excess of substrate can protect the enzyme from NEM modification. Site-directed mutagenesis of His-362 and Asp-328 to alanine resulted in inactivation of hBAT suggesting that these two residues are critical for the enzyme activity. These results are also consistent with the conservation of these residues as shown by sequence alignment with related enzymes (Fig. 1) and the hBAT protein structure as predicted by comparison to dienelactone hydrolase and other α/β hydrolases of known structures. His-362 and Asp-328 are the only histidine and aspartate residues conserved among BATs, thioesterases, and dienelactone hydrolases (Fig. 1). Previous studies have shown that these residues are critical for enzyme activity in thioesterases and α/β hydrolases (13Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M.

J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 379-383Google Scholar). Since the Asp and His residues are responsible for providing the nucleophile negative charge and relaying it to the cysteine residue, their replacement with alanine would destroy the charge relay system, thereby inactivating the enzyme. When Cys-235 was mutated to a serine, the C235S mutant enzyme had a lower N-acyltransferase activity. In contrast, its thioesterase activity was substantially enhanced. It is thought that once an acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed, the final product formation depends on the nucleophilic attack from either one of the second substrates or water (Fig. 6). For instance, when glycine was used for the serine acyl-enzyme produced from C235S mutant hBAT, the nucleophilic attack from water is more efficient than that from glycine, resulting in cholate as the major product and glycocholate as a minor product (Fig. 5). This can also be used to explain why β-alanine, the carboxylic acid analog of taurine, is a poor substrate of hBAT (7Kimura M. Okuno E. Inada J. Ohyama H. Kido R. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 637-645Google Scholar), whereas both 2-fluoro-β-alanine (a stronger acid) and taurine are excellent substrates (24Sweeny D.J. Barnes S. Heggie G.D. Diasio R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5439-5443Google Scholar). The result is also consistent with previous studies on thioesterases, in which the serine acyl-enzyme intermediate was shown to be unstable relative to the cysteine acyl-enzyme intermediate. For these enzymes, when the active site serine was mutated to a cysteine and the mutant enzyme was incubated with acyl-CoA, the cysteine acyl-enzyme was long-lived (14Huhtinen K. O' Byrne J. Lindquist P.J.G. Contreras J.A. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3424-3432Google Scholar, 15Pazirandeh M. Chirala S.S. Wakil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20946-20952Google Scholar). Although Cys-372 in hBAT is the other conserved Cys residue among BATs, site-directed mutagenesis suggested that despite being critical for BAT activity, it is unlikely to be the nucleophile in the enzyme reaction. When Cys-372 was mutated to an alanine residue, the C372A mutant hBAT retained low, but significant N-acyltransferase activity. Mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction products of C372A mutant hBAT established that this mutant hBAT retained activity (data not shown). From amino acid sequence alignment (Fig. 1), hBAT is significantly related to acyl-CoA thioesterases. The thioesterases use a catalytic triad composed of Ser-His-Asp with Ser residue as the nucleophile. In fact, a previous study with human hepatocyte has shown that hBAT possesses some bile acid-CoA thioesterase activity and may be related to long chain acyl-CoA thioesterases (25Solaas K. Ulvestad A. Söreide O. Kase B.F. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1154-1162Google Scholar, 26Lindquist P.J. Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 631-640Google Scholar, 27Svensson L.T. Alexson S.E.H.

Very recently, an acyl-CoA thioesterase, PTE-2, having highest activities when CoA esters of primary bile acids cholyl-CoA and chenodeoxycholyl-CoA used as its substrates was found (29Hunt M.C. Solaas K. Kase B.F. Alexson S.E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1128-1138Google Scholar). The nucleotides that code for Cys are TGT on hBAT, and the ones for Ser are TCT on C235S mutant hBAT. Witkowskiet al. have speculated the evolutionary significance of hydrolase to transferase conversions via single nucleotide changes in the case of a fatty acyl-thioester hydrolase, thioesterase II (18Witkowski A. Witkowska H.E. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 379-383Google Scholar). Although this is the first time the Cys → Ser mutation has been done on the N-acyltransferase, the close relationship between thioesterases and hydrolases is once again demonstrated. hBAT is one of the key enzymes for bile acid amidation, which is important for absorption of fats and fat soluble substances, such as fat soluble vitamins, in human (3Schroeder A. Eckhardt U. Stieger B. Tynes R. Schteingart C.D. Hofmann A.F. Meier P.J. Hagenbuch B. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G370-G375Google Scholar). Mutations in the enzyme due to genetic defects could cause many problems because of the lack of these essential substances. We thank Dr. Alexey G. Murzin (Center for Protein Engineering, MRC Cambridge, UK) for the protein structure modeling of hBAT, Dr. Rachel Lacasse for hBAT separation from GroEL-hBAT complex, Dr. Peter Prevelige for the helpful discussions and suggestions, and Michelle Johnson for assistance with the project."
https://openalex.org/W2059463571,"Adult T-cell leukemia is caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). The HTLV-I Tax protein is essential for clinical manifestations because it activates viral and cellular gene transcription. Tax enhances production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which may lead to bone and joint destruction. Because estrogens might prevent osteoporosis by repressing <i>TNF</i>-α gene transcription, we investigated whether estrogens inhibit the transcriptional effects of Tax on the <i>TNF</i>-α promoter. Tax activated the −1044, −163, and −125 <i>TNF</i>-α promoters by 9–25-fold but not the −82 promoter, demonstrating that Tax activation requires the −125 to −82 region, known as the TNF response element (TNF-RE). Three copies of the TNF-RE upstream of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter conferred a similar magnitude of activation by Tax. We demonstrated that c-Jun, NFκB, p50, and p65 interact with and activate the TNF-RE by using mutational analysis of the TNF-RE, Tax mutants that selectively activate NFκB or the cAMP-response element binding protein/activating transcription factor pathway, and gel shift assays with nuclear extracts. Estradiol markedly repressed Tax-activated transcription of the <i>TNF</i>-α gene with estrogen receptor (ER) α or β. Nuclear extracts from U2OS cells stably transfected with ERα demonstrated that ERs interact with the TNF-RE. Our studies provide evidence that ERs repress Tax-activated<i>TNF</i>-α transcription by interacting with a c-Jun and NFκB platform on the TNF-RE. Estrogens may ameliorate bone and inflammatory joint diseases in patients infected with HTLV-I by repressing transcription of the <i>TNF</i>-α gene."

Hum. Genet. 1981; 57: 231-246Google Scholar). It is thought to arise when multipotential cells of the metanephric blastema fail to differentiate and remain locked in a state of continual proliferation, and it has long been considered an excellent model for studying the relationship between cancer and development. A tumor suppressor gene,wt1, implicated in predisposition to WT, has been extensively characterized and is mutated in 10–15% of sporadic WTs (2Varanasi R. Bardeesy N. Ghahremani M. Petruzzi M.J.

The wt1 gene encodes a transcription factor with a proline-glutamine-rich amino terminus and four carboxyl-terminal zinc fingers of the Krüppel C2-H2 class. The mRNA contains two alternative sites of translation initiation (4Bruening W. Pelletier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8646-8654Google Scholar,5Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G.

A. 1991; 88: 9618-9622Google Scholar), and undergoes RNA editing (8Sharma P.M. Bowman M. Madden S.L. Rauscher III., F.J. Sukumar S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 720-731Google Scholar), thus potentially encoding 24 different protein isoforms with predicted molecular masses of 36–65 kDa. The function of the alternative translation initiation events, the RNA editing modification, and the first alternative splicing event (exon V) have not been well defined, although exon V can repress transcription when fused to a heterologous DNA-binding domain (9Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Huang J. Gurrieri M. Deuel T.F. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 415-422Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of exon IX inserts or removes three amino acids (±KTS) (referred to as WT1(+KTS) or WT1(−KTS)) between zinc fingers III and IV and changes the DNA binding specificity of WT1 (10Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Google Scholar). The WT1(−KTS) isoforms can bind to two DNA motifs as follows: (i) a GC-rich motif, 5′GXGXGGGXG3′, related to the EGR-1-binding site (10Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Google Scholar); and (ii) a (5′TCC3′)n-containing sequence (11Wang Z.Y. Qiu Q.Q. Enger K.T. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8896-8900Google Scholar). Recently NMR relaxation studies (12Laity J.H. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11932-11935Google Scholar) have indicated that the KTS insertion increases the flexibility of the linker between fingers III and IV and abrogates binding of the fourth zinc finger to its cognate site in the DNA major groove. A number of genes involved in growth regulation and cellular differentiation contain WT1-binding sites within their promoters, and their expression can be modulated by WT1 in transfection assays (reviewed in Refs. 13Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28Google Scholar, 14Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Google Scholar, 15Scharnhorst V. Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 141-161Google Scholar). The wt1 gene product has been shown to mediate both transcriptional repression and activation (reviewed in Refs. 13Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28Google Scholar, 14Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Google Scholar, 15Scharnhorst V. Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 141-161Google Scholar). Whether WT1 behaves as an activator or repressor appears to depend on promoter architecture surrounding the WT1-binding sites as well as on the presence of auxiliary transacting factors. Accordingly, it is well accepted that WT1 activity can be controlled by protein-protein interactions. A number of proteins are known to associate with WT1 and these include p53, p73, p63, SF-1, Par-4, Ciao 1, UBC9, Hsp70, U2AF65, CBP/p300, WTAP, and WT1 itself (reviewed in Refs. 13Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28Google Scholar, 14Lee S.B. Haber D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 74-99Google Scholar, 15Scharnhorst V. Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 141-161Google Scholar). The interaction of some of these proteins with WT1 is associated with modification of WT1 transcriptional properties as well as effects on the properties of the interacting partner (see “Discussion”). An additional role for WT1 in splicing is also postulated based on the subnuclear localization of WT1(+KTS) isoforms and the interaction of these isoforms with splicing factors (16Larsson S.H.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3217-3225Google Scholar). Utilizing affinity chromatography of nuclear extracts passed over immobilized WT1 protein, followed by mass spectrometric analysis of a specifically retained protein, we have identified a novel WT1-interacting protein, named bone marrow zinc finger 2 (BMZF2). BMZF2 was first identified from a screen of zinc finger proteins expressed in the hematopoietic system (19Han Z.G. Zhang Q.H. Ye M. Kan L.X. Gu B.W. He K.L. Shi S.L. Zhou J. Fu G. Mao M. Chen S.J. Yu L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35741-35748Google Scholar). The BMZF2 protein has 18 tandem zinc fingers and a Krüppel-related amino-terminal domain. Aside from RT-PCR analysis of BMZF2 transcripts demonstrating the presence of BMZF2 transcripts in a large number of tissues (19Han Z.G. Zhang Q.H. Ye M. Kan L.X. Gu B.W. He K.L. Shi S.L. Zhou J. Fu G. Mao M. Chen S.J. Yu L. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35741-35748Google Scholar), no further characterization of this gene has been reported. Here we demonstrate that WT1 physically interacts with BMZF2 and that this interaction inhibits WT1-mediated transcriptional activation. Additionally, fusion of BMZF2 to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain produced a chimera capable of repressing transcription of a reporter gene containing GAL4-binding sites, indicating that BMZF2 is a novel transcriptional repressor. These results suggest that BMZF2 interferes with the transactivation properties of WT1. Restriction endonucleases, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, T4 DNA ligase, and T4 DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. The luciferase assay kit was purchased from Promega. [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), [35S]methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol),d-threo-[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol (54.0 Ci/mmol), [3H]CTP (21.8 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Preparation of plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis of DNA, DNA ligation, and bacterial transformations were carried out using standard methods (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Clones of DNA PCR amplification products were always sequenced by the chain termination method using double-stranded DNA templates to ensure the absence of mutations. 293 and COS-7 cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), penicillin, and streptomycin. For transient transfections, cells were plated at a density of 2–5 × 105 cells per 100-mm diameter dish 24 h prior to transfection. The cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Individual DNA precipitates were adjusted to contain equal amounts of total DNA by the addition of the empty expression vector, pcDNA3. All transfections and subsequent CAT and luciferase assays were performed at least in duplicate. Cells were washed and refed 16 h post-transfection and harvested ∼48 h later. Cells were scraped from the dishes following a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) wash, centrifuged, and resuspended in 150 μl of 250 mm Tris (pH 8.0). They were then subjected to three rounds of freeze-thaw; an aliquot was taken for measurement of β-galactosidase activity, and the remainder of the extract was heated to 65 °C for 10 min and then assayed for CAT activity (21Gorman C. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. 2. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar). Following thin layer chromatography, regions containing acetylated [14C]chloramphenicol, as well as unacetylated [14C]chloramphenicol, were quantitated by direct analysis on a PhosphorImager (Fujix BAS 2000). Luciferase activity was determined using the Promega luciferase assay kit. All CAT and luciferase activity values were normalized to β-galactosidase values, which served as internal controls in the transfections. The human BMZF2 cDNA was cloned by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification from HeLa cells. The amplification primers used for this purpose were (i) 5′-th01 (5′-GATCCTCGAGATGGAGACTGTTTCAGAA-3′; XhoI site underlined) and (ii) 3′-th02 (5′-GATCAAGCTTCTAAGGTTTTTCTCCAAC-3′; HindIII site underlined). The 1.8-kbp PCR product was digested withXhoI and HindIII and cloned into the same sites of pKSII+ to generate pKSII/BMZF2-(1–622). Deletion constructs of BMZF2 were prepared as follows.

The PCR product was introduced into the XhoI and HindIII sites of pKSII+. (iii) For pKSII/BMZF2-(81–370), the corresponding fragment was generated by PCR using primers 5′-th06 (5′-GTTAAAGCTTACCATGCATCAACAATTACACTCA-3′;HindIII site underlined) and 3′-th07 (5′-GTTACTGCAGCAGTTTCTCTCCTGTATG-3′; PstI site underlined).

The fragment was digested withHindIII and PstI and introduced into the same sites of pKSII+. (v) For pKSII/BMZF2-(231–370), the corresponding fragment was generated by PCR using primers 5′-th09 (5′-GTTAAAGCTTACCATGCCATTCCGATGTGATACG-3′;HindIII site underlined) and 3′-th07. The fragment was digested with HindIII and PstI and introduced into the same sites of pKSII+.

The fragment was digested with HindIII andPstI and introduced into the same sites of pKSII+. To generate amino-terminally hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged BMZF2 (CMV/BMZF2-(1–622)), the entire coding region of BMZF2 was excised from pKSII/BMZF2-(1–622) utilizing XhoI/XbaI, and this was inserted in-frame into the XhoI/XbaI site of pcDNA3-HA-Eco12mer (a derivative of pcDNA3 containing three copies of the HA peptide epitope (NH2-YPYDVPDYAG-COOH)) (kindly provided by H. Imataka and N. Sonenberg, McGill University). Plasmid CMV/BMZF2-(1–230) was constructed by PCR utilizing primers 5′-th12 (5′-GTTAAAGCTTATGGAGACTGTTTCAGAA-3′;HindIII site underlined) and 3′-th13 (5′-GTTACTCGAGTGGTTTCTCTGCCGTGTG-3′; XhoI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XhoI and cloned into the same sites of pcDNA3. Plasmid CMV/BMZF2-(Δ231–370) was constructed by PCR-mediated mutagenesis with primers 5′-th14 (5′-GTTACTCGAGTAAAATTGTAAGGAATGT-3′; XhoI site underlined) spanning an internal XhoI site and 5′-th15 (5′-GTTATCTAGACTAAGGTTTTTCCTCCAA-3′; XbaI site underlined). The PCR product was digested with XhoI andXbaI and cloned into the same sites of CMV/BMZF2-(1–230). To generate CMV/GAL4/BMZF2, the BMZF2 coding region (amino acids 1–622) was removed from pKSII/BMZF2-(1–622) using HindIII and XhoI, repaired with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and ligated into the XmaI site (Klenow repaired) of the yeast two-hybrid vector pGBKT7, producing pGBKT7/BMZF2-(1–622) and placing the Gal4 DNA domain upstream and in-frame with the entire BMZF2 coding region. The Gal4-BMZF2 fusion was excised from pGBKT7-BMZF2 utilizing HindIII andBamHI and inserted into the same sites of pcDNA3. The construction and use of GST-WT1 bacterial expression vectors, eukaryotic expression vectors for WT1, the human vitamin D promoter reporter construct (−960 phVDR/Luc), the Dax-1 reporter construct (pmDAX-1/CAT), the expression vector encoding the HA-tagged murinesingle-minded gene product (HA tagged SIM-2) (CMV/SIM-2), and the thymidine kinase (TK)-based reporters, pTECAT and pTECAT/5XGAL4, have been described previously (3Pelletier J.

Fifty (150-mm) plates of HeLa S3 cells were grown for the preparation of nuclear extracts. Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (4 mm) (Invitrogen) and grown at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. The cells were harvested by scraping in cold PBS and collected by centrifugation. After washing in PBS, the cell pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT) supplemented with 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmleupeptin, and 1 mm antipain. The cells were lysed using a type B Dounce, and lysis was verified by staining with trypan blue. The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 1500 ×g, and the supernatant was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 5.5 ml of 75 mm NaCl Affinity Chromatography (AC) Buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA) with protease inhibitors and sonicated for 60 s (2 bursts of 30 s) at 4 °C. The lysate was then centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 20,800 ×g, and the supernatant was collected. GST and GST-WT1ZF (WT1 zinc fingers I–IV fused in-frame to GST) recombinant protein were coupled to Affi-Gel 10 at a protein/resin concentration of 0, 0.5, and 2.0 mg/ml. Coupling reactions were performed in a final volume of 200 μl of AC buffer by incubating at 4 °C overnight and rotating the samples end-over-end. The affinity matrix was washed in AC buffer containing 75 mm NaCl and 80 mmethanolamine at room temperature for 1 h, followed by an additional 1 h wash in 75 mm NaCl-AC buffer containing 1 mg/ml purified bovine serum albumin. The matrix was then washed with AC buffer containing 1 m NaCl at room temperature for 10 min and then equilibrated and stored in AC buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. Coupling efficiencies were ∼80%. Ten column volumes (1 ml) of HeLa nuclear extract were applied to a small column containing 100 μl of affinity matrix. The resin was washed 3 times with AC buffer containing 75 mm NaCl. Elutions were performed sequentially with 2 times 2 column volumes (2 × 200 μl) of each of the following: (i) 75 mm NaCl-AC buffer with 1% Triton X-100; (ii) 300 mm NaCl-AC buffer; (iii) 1m NaCl-AC buffer; and (iv) 1% SDS-AC buffer. One-quarter of each fraction was analyzed on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were prepared for silver staining by fixing overnight in 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid followed by a 10-min rinse in 20% ethanol and a 10-min rinse in water. Gels were then reduced with sodium thiosulfate (0.2 g/liter) for 1 min, rinsed twice with water for 20 s, and incubated in silver nitrate (2.0 g/liter) for 30 min. Gels were washed once with developing solution (sodium carbonate (30 g/liter), formaldehyde (1.4 ml of 37% solution/liter), sodium thiosulfate (10 mg/liter)) for 30 s and incubated in the developing solution until the desired intensity was reached. The reaction was stopped by exchanging the developing solution with 1% acetic acid for a minimum of 20 min. Specifically eluted bands were excised from the gel. The tryptic digestions of the protein samples were performed by Borealis Biosciences Inc., and the molecular mass of the tryptic fragments was determined with a Perspective Biosystems Voyager Elite MALDI-TOF (Toronto, Canada). The protein was identified by matching the observed proteolytic masses obtained in the MALDI-TOF spectra with the hypothetical tryptic peptide masses derived from the NCBI non-redundant translated GenBankTM data base. To express BMZF2 recombinant protein, we subcloned the amino-terminal non-zinc finger domain (amino acids 1–80) of BMZF from pKSII/BMZF2-(1–80) by digesting with BamHI and EcoRI and placing the coding fragment into the same sites of pGEX-6P-1 to produce pGEX-6P-1/BMZF2. GST-BMZF2 was produced and purified according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Promega). The GST domain was remove by digesting with PreScission Protease (Promega) overnight at 4 °C, followed by passing of the material through a second glutathione affinity matrix. Rabbits were immunized with BMZF2-(1–80) (4Bruening W. Pelletier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8646-8654Google Scholar). Affinity-purified anti-BMZF2 antibodies were obtained by using immunoaffinity columns containing BMZF2-(1–80) immobilized to Affi-Gel 10 resin (Amersham Biosciences). For the analysis of the interaction between endogenous WT1 and BMZF2, K562 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 μg/ml of Pefabloc, and 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A) for 10 min on ice. Lysates were sonicated twice for 15 s and incubated with 420 mm NaCl in lysis buffer for 1 h on ice. Extracts were incubated with the indicated antisera or antibodies, and immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 6 times with lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 1× SDS loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting using anti-WT1 antibody (F-6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-BMZF2 antibody. Northern blotting was carried out on commercially available blots according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Promega). Blots were probed with32P-labeled human BMZF2 cDNA probe (240-bp fragment obtained by BamHI/EcoRI digest of pKSII/BMZF2-(1–80)) (∼9 × 107 cpm/μg) and a human β-actin probe (∼1.0-kbp fragment obtained byEcoRI/XhoI digest of pKSII+-β-actin) (∼9 × 107 cpm/μg). Both probes had been prepared by random priming (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Probing was performed at a probe concentration of 106 cpm/ml at 42 °C in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5× SSPE (1× SSPE is 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01 mNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 2× Denhardt's reagent, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg of denatured, fragmented salmon sperm DNA/ml). The blot was then washed once in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C, and subjected to autoradiography. 293 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of CMV/BMZF2-(1–622) and 10 μg of CMV/WT1 (−/−). After 48 h, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mmMgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 mm vanadyl ribonucleoside complex). Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 min at 10,000 rpm. The pellet was resuspended in the same volume of lysis buffer as the cytoplasmic extract and freeze/thawed for 3 cycles, and protein content in the lysates were quantitated utilizing the Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce). Cell equivalents of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBST (80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), the membrane was probed with either an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11, Babco) or anti-WT1 polyclonal antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane was washed in PBST, and antibody binding was visualized with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse (for anti-HA antibodies) and donkey anti-rabbit (for anti-WT1 antibodies) secondary antibody (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences) utilizing ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). In vitrotranscriptions of pKSII/BMZF2-(1–622) and deletion constructs were performed using T3 RNA polymerase on templates that had been linearized with XbaI. In vitro translations were performed in the presence of [35S]methionine in rabbit reticulocyte lysates, essentially as described by the manufacturer (Promega). Forin vitro synthesis of p53, an SP65-based plasmid containing the p53 gene (linearized with HindIII) was used in transcription reactions with SP6 RNA polymerase. In vitrosynthesized translation products were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, treated with EN3HANCE, dried, and exposed to X-Omat film (Eastman Kodak Co.). GST and GST-WT1ZF (containing WT1 zinc fingers I–IV fused to GST) recombinant proteins were purified as described previously (23Bardeesy N. Pelletier J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1784-1792Google Scholar). Briefly, bacterial extracts producing GST or GST-WT1 recombinant proteins were incubated with a 50% slurry of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in TNE-150 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mmEDTA, 150 mm NaCl) with rocking. GST proteins bound to the beads were then collected by brief centrifugation (12,000 ×g) and washed four times with TNE-150 buffer. The captured protein was then used in GST pulldown assays. An aliquot of the captured protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the yield estimated by Coomassie Blue staining. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins synthesized from in vitro translation reactions were incubated with immobilized GST or GST-WT1 proteins in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 12.5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm DTT, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μg/ml ethidium bromide) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed 4 times with 1 ml of binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 1× SDS loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.9), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) and were separated by electrophoresis. 293 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of CMV/WT1 (−/−) together with 10 μg of pcDNA3, CMV/BMZF2-(1–622), CMV/Par-4, or CMV/SIM DNA. After 48 h, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 5 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml of Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml of 1-chloro-3-(4-tosylamido)-4-phenyl-2-butanone, 1 μg/ml of 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-l-2-heptanone, 5 mm NaF, and 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate) for 30 min on ice. Extracts were incubated with anti-WT1 antibodies (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight, and immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed 6 times with lysis buffer, and the proteins were eluted with 1× SDS loading buffer. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 5% skim milk in PBST, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with anti-HA antibody (1:1000) (HA.11, Babco). The membrane was washed in PBST, and antibody binding was visualized with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:5000) (Amersham Biosciences) utilizing ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The nucleotide sequence of a full-length human BMZF2 cDNA has been deposited in the GenBankTM data base under accession numberAY148489. Genetic screens and chemical cross-linkers have identified a small number of proteins that interact with the WT1 zinc finger domain (see “Discussion”). We looked to employ a biochemical approach to validate the interaction of previously described WT1-interacting proteins, as well as identify potentially new protein(s) that could interact with the WT1 zinc finger domain. To this end, HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with Affi-Gel 10 resin that had been coupled to GST or GST-WT1ZF fusion proteins. Elutions obtained with 300 mm NaCl, 1 m NaCl, and 1% SDS were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Two proteins, an ∼40-kDa (denoted by anasterisk) and ∼30-kDa (denoted by an arrow) species, were visible in the 1 m NaCl elution (Fig.1 A). The 40-kDa species is present in elutions from both the GST and GST-WT1ZF affinity matrices (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2,3, and 5–7) and was not observed if HeLa nuclear extract were omitted from the GST or GST-WT1ZF columns (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 4). These results suggest that the 40-kDa protein speci"

This residue lies close to the channel activation gate, the ionic selectivity filter, and the main pore blocker binding site. Despite their high amino acid sequence homologies and common role in conducting chloride ions, recent studies have suggested that the GlyRs and GABAARs have divergent open state pore structures at the 6′ position. When both the human α1T6′C homomeric GlyR and the rat α1T6′Cβ1T6′C heteromeric GABAAR were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, their 6′ residue surface accessibilities differed significantly in the closed state. However, when a soluble cysteine-modifying compound was applied in the presence of saturating agonist concentrations, both receptors were locked into the open state. This action was not induced by oxidizing agents in either receptor. These results provide evidence for a conserved pore opening mechanism in anion-selective members of the ligand-gated ion channel family. The results also indicate that the GABAAR pore structure at the 6′ level may vary between different expression systems.

Pusch H. Hovemann B.T. Hatt H. Nature Neurosci. 2002; 5: 11-12Google Scholar). Functional receptors of this family comprise five homologous subunits arranged in a ring to form a central ion-conducting pore. Each subunit is composed of a large extracellular ligand-binding N-terminal domain, four membrane-spanning segments (M1–M4), and a large intracellular domain between M3 and M4.The pore-lining, second transmembrane (M2) domain has an α-helical secondary structure that undergoes a conformational change as the channel is opened (2Karlin A. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Google Scholar). To investigate this process in detail, state-dependent differences in the surface exposure of M2 domain residues can be assayed using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (3Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Google Scholar). In this technique, residues are mutated individually to cysteines, and changes in their reactivity rates with soluble cysteine-reactive reagents can identify structural changes between different functional states. As expected for receptors belonging to the same family, this technique has generally yielded a good correlation between the open state M2 domain secondary structures of the nAChR (4Akabas M.H.

It is close to the activation gate (6Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Google Scholar, 11Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M.

Therefore, structural differences at this level may be expected to have significant functional consequences. In the homomeric α1T6′C GlyR expressed in a mammalian HEK293 cell line, Shan et al. (17Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1109-1120Google Scholar) concluded that the surface exposure of introduced 6′ cysteines was increased in the channel open state. In contrast, in the α1T6′Cβ1T6′CGABAAR expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the 6′ cysteines were found to be exposed in the closed state and rotated to face the adjacent subunits in the open state (18Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Google Scholar). Thus, despite having a high M2 domain amino acid sequence homology (see Fig. 1 A) and a common function in conducting chloride ions, the GlyR and GABAAR appear to be structurally divergent at this position.The aim of this study was to conduct a detailed comparative study into the surface accessibility of the 6′ cysteines in the GlyR and GABAAR when both are expressed recombinantly in a common (HEK293 cell) expression system. The main findings are that the respective pore structures at the 6′ positions are significantly different in the closed states but that there appear to be similarities in the mechanisms of channel opening. The results also reveal distinct differences in the structural and functional properties of GABAARs depending on whether they are expressed inXenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells.CONCLUSIONSThe closed state reactivity of 6′ cysteines in the GlyR and the GABAAR differ in two respects. First, the GABAAR 6′ cysteines spontaneously form disulfide bonds in the closed state, whereas those of the GlyR do not. Second, the GABAAR 6′ cysteines are accessible to externally applied MTSEA whereas the GlyR 6′ cysteines are not. Although it is not possible to define the structural basis for these differences, these results provide evidence for divergent pore structures in the closed channel state. Closed state structural differences have been identified previously in cationic members of the LGIC family. Although the nAChR pore was shown to admit externally applied MTSEA and MTSET as far as the 2′ residue (4Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Google Scholar, 5Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Google Scholar, 6Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Google Scholar), access of the same compounds in the 5HT3R pore was impeded near the 14′ residue (10Paniker S. Cruz H. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1629-1639Google Scholar). Thus, closed state pore structures show considerable variation in both anionic and cationic members of the LGIC family.On the other hand, substituted cysteine accessibility studies reveal that cationic LGIC family members have remarkably similar patterns of M2 domain residue exposure in the channel open state (4Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Google Scholar, 5Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Google Scholar, 6Wilson G.G. Karlin A.

Of particular relevance to the present study, MTSET modification of 6′ cysteines irreversibly inhibited current in both the nAChR and 5HT3R, whereas MTSES had no effect on either receptor (4Akabas M.H.

The present study could not directly compare 6′ cysteine accessibility in the open states of the α1T6′C GlyR and α1T6′Cβ1T6′C GABAAR because of the fast desensitization rate of the α1T6′Cβ1T6′C GABAAR. The observation that MTSET locked both receptors into the partially open state provides strong evidence for a common activation mechanism in this part of the pore. However, the pore structures are unlikely to be identical as MTSEA also locked the α1T6′Cβ1T6′C GABAAR in the open state but had no such effect on the α1T6′C GlyR.The present study reveals distinct differences in the properties of GABAARs expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells. When expressed in HEK293 cells, the 6′ cysteines can form disulfide bonds in the closed state. However, this does not occur when the same receptors are expressed in Xenopus oocytes (18Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Google Scholar). Furthermore, when expressed in HEK293 cells, the GABAAR is locked in the desensitized state by Cu:phen, but when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it is locked in the open state by Cu:phen (18Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate the surface orientation of the GABAAR 6′ cysteines varies dramatically depending on the expression system. Moreover, α1T6′Cβ1T6′C GABAARs expressed in HEK293 cells desensitize at a much faster rate than they do when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. These structural and functional differences could be because of expression system-specific differences in subunit folding and assembly, post-translational modifications, or membrane lipid composition. Regardless of their origin, the results indicate that caution should be applied when comparing results obtained using the two expression systems.

Pusch H. Hovemann B.T. Hatt H. Nature Neurosci. 2002; 5: 11-12Google Scholar). Functional receptors of this family comprise five homologous subunits arranged in a ring to form a central ion-conducting pore. Each subunit is composed of a large extracellular ligand-binding N-terminal domain, four membrane-spanning segments (M1–M4), and a large intracellular domain between M3 and M4. The pore-lining, second transmembrane (M2) domain has an α-helical secondary structure that undergoes a conformational change as the channel is opened (2Karlin A. Nature Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Google Scholar). To investigate this process in detail, state-dependent differences in the surface exposure of M2 domain residues can be assayed using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (3Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Google Scholar). In this technique, residues are mutated individually to cysteines, and changes in their reactivity rates with soluble cysteine-reactive reagents can identify structural changes between different functional states. As expected for receptors belonging to the same family, this technique has generally yielded a good correlation between the open state M2 domain secondary structures of the nAChR (4Akabas M.H.

Slesinger P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1629-1639Google Scholar). The M2 domain 6′ residue, which is a threonine in the GlyR α1 subunit and the GABAAR α1 and β1 subunits (see Fig.1 A), lines a critical part of the pore. It is close to the activation gate (6Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Google Scholar, 11Revah F. Bertrand D. Galzi J.L. Devillers-Thiery A. Mulle C. Hussy N. Bertrand S. Ballivet M.

Therefore, structural differences at this level may be expected to have significant functional consequences. In the homomeric α1T6′C GlyR expressed in a mammalian HEK293 cell line, Shan et al. (17Shan Q. Haddrill J.L. Lynch J.W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1109-1120Google Scholar) concluded that the surface exposure of introduced 6′ cysteines was increased in the channel open state. In contrast, in the α1T6′Cβ1T6′CGABAAR expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the 6′ cysteines were found to be exposed in the closed state and rotated to face the adjacent subunits in the open state (18Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nature Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Google Scholar). Thus, despite having a high M2 domain amino acid sequence homology (see Fig. 1 A) and a common function in conducting chloride ions, the GlyR and GABAAR appear to be structurally divergent at this position. The aim of this study was to conduct a detailed comparative study into the surface accessibility of the 6′ cysteines in the GlyR and GABAAR when both are expressed recombinantly in a common (HEK293 cell) expression system. The main findings are that the respective pore structures at the 6′ positions are significantly different in the closed states but that there appear to be similarities in the mechanisms of channel opening. The results also reveal distinct differences in the structural and functional properties of GABAARs depending on whether they are expressed inXenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells. CONCLUSIONSThe closed state reactivity of 6′ cysteines in the GlyR and the GABAAR differ in two respects. First, the GABAAR 6′ cysteines spontaneously form disulfide bonds in the closed state, whereas those of the GlyR do not. Second, the GABAAR 6′ cysteines are accessible to externally applied MTSEA whereas the GlyR 6′ cysteines are not. Although it is not possible to define the structural basis for these differences, these results provide evidence for divergent pore structures in the closed channel state. Closed state structural differences have been identified previously in cationic members of the LGIC family. Although the nAChR pore was shown to admit externally applied MTSEA and MTSET as far as the 2′ residue (4Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Google Scholar, 5Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Google Scholar, 6Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Google Scholar), access of the same compounds in the 5HT3R pore was impeded near the 14′ residue (10Paniker S. Cruz H. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1629-1639Google Scholar). Thus, closed state pore structures show considerable variation in both anionic and cationic members of the LGIC family.On the other hand, substituted cysteine accessibility studies reveal that cationic LGIC family members have remarkably similar patterns of M2 domain residue exposure in the channel open state (4Akabas M.H.

Of particular relevance to the present study, MTSET modification of 6′ cysteines irreversibly inhibited current in both the nAChR and 5HT3R, whereas MTSES had no effect on either receptor (4Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Google Scholar, 5Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Google Scholar, 6Wilson G.G. Karlin A.

The present study could not directly compare 6′ cysteine accessibility in the open states of the α1T6′C GlyR and α1T6′Cβ1T6′C GABAAR because of the fast desensitization rate of the α1T6′Cβ1T6′C GABAAR.

Furthermore, when expressed in HEK293 cells, the GABAAR is locked in the desensitized state by Cu:phen, but when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, it is locked in the open state by Cu:phen (18Horenstein J.

The diverse functions of Vpr support interactions of this HIV accessory protein with host cell partners of important pathways. hVIP/mov34 (human Vpr InteractingProtein) is one of these identified Vpr ligands. hVIP is a 34-kDa member of the eIF3 family that is vital for early embryonic development in transgenic mice and important in cell cycle regulation. Its interaction with Vpr, however, is not yet clearly defined. Therefore, we constructed a panel of deletion mutants of this cytoplasmic cellular ligand to map the protein domain that mediates its interaction with Vpr. We observed that the carboxyl-terminal region of hVIP is critical for its interaction with Vpr. In the absence of Vpr or HIV infection, full-length hVIP is expressed in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization pattern of full-length hVIP protein, however, is shifted to a clear nuclear localization pattern in cells expressing both hVIP and Vpr. In contrast, Vpr did not alter the localization pattern of hVIP mutants, which have their carboxyl-terminal domain deleted. The movement of hVIP supported prior work that suggested that Vpr triggers activation of the GR receptor complex. In fact, we also observed that dexamethasone moves hVIP into the nucleus and that glucocorticoid antagonists inhibit this effect. Interestingly, the expression of an hVIP carboxyl-terminal mutant, which is not responsive to Vpr, is also not responsive to dexamethasone. These data illustrate that the carboxyl-terminal domain of hVIP is critical for mediating hVIP-Vpr interaction as well as for its glucocorticoid response. These results support the view that hVIP is a member of the complex array of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins that are regulated by HIV infection and glucocorticoids.

However, the additional biology of hVIP-Vpr interaction has not yet been determined. Here we demonstrate that Vpr interactions with hVIP are completely dependent on the carboxyl-terminal region of mov34. We further find that hVIP is a GR-responsive protein. Experimental results strongly suggest that hVIP is associated with the activated glucocorticoid receptor complex. The carboxyl-terminal region of this ligand appears to be critical in governing its interaction with Vpr as well as in mediating the glucocorticoid-induced effect observed on hVIP. HeLa and CV-1 cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Culture media and other standard tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. The stock of recombinant vaccinia (vFT7–3) virus containing the T7 RNA polymerase gene was also received from ATCC. Polyclonal antisera for immunological detection of Vpr were described earlier (35Mahalingam S. Ayyavoo V. Patel M. Kieber-Emmons T. Weiner D.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6339-6347Google Scholar). Anti-His-tagged (carboxyl terminus) mouse monoclonal antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-glucocorticoid receptors were purchased from Clontech and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Dexamethasone and mifepristone (RU486) were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The pchVIP expression plasmid that encodes a chimeric hVIP with a polyhistidine tag at its carboxyl terminus was previously described (32Mahalingam S. Ayyavoo V. Patel M. Kieber-Emmons T. Kao G.D. Muschel R.J. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 3419-3424Google Scholar, 34Ramanathan M.P. Ayyavoo V. Weiner D.B. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 101-106Google Scholar). pcVpr vector for expression of Vpr was constructed using the PCR-amplified Vpr sequence of the pNL43 allele of HIV-1, which contains an open reading frame encoding the sequence of the wild-type Vpr. The resulting PCR fragment was appropriately digested and cloned intoHindIII-XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). Similarly, a vector expressing hGRα, pcGR, was constructed by sub-cloning a PCR-amplified GR coding region from the plasmid, pRShGRα, that was purchased from ATCC. The pool of PCR fragments corresponding to the GR-coding region was digested appropriately and inserted intoKpnI-XbaI-digested pcDNA3.1 expression vector. The integrity of these constructs was confirmed by automated sequencing. The deletion mutants were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis. Briefly, selected portions of the hVIP open reading frame were amplified by Taq polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) from pchVIP plasmid as template using appropriate primers. Fig. 2 reveals the schematic plan for the construction of the mutants. Primers for the construction of the hVIP-NM mutant are 5′-CTCCAGATGGAGGTGGATG-3′ and 5′-GCATAGGCCACCCGGCAGGAT-3′; primers for making the hVIP-MC mutant are 5′-CCACCTGACCCCTCGGACAT-3′ and 5′-GCATAGGCCACCC-GGCAGGAT-3′; primers for amplifying the carboxyl-terminal region alone to make the hVIP-C mutant are 5′-ATGACAGCAA-CAGGCAGTGG-3′ and 5′-AGCCCGCGCATTCTCCTGC-3′. To construct an hVIP mutant (hVIP-NC) that has a deletion of its central core domain, an overlap-PCR approach was used. Briefly, in the first set of PCR, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions were amplified in separate reactions. During this step, a reverse primer for the amino-terminal amplification was designed to have overlapping bases corresponding to the 3′-end of the carboxyl-terminal region. In the second set of reactions, the amino- and carboxyl-terminal-amplified fragments from the first set of PCR were used as templates to amplify the fusion fragment, using the forward primer of the amino-terminal region and the reverse primer of the carboxyl-terminal domain of hVIP. Because the 5′-end of the amino-terminal had overlapping bases corresponding to the 3′-end of the carboxyl terminus, the second set of PCR reactions resulted in the fusion of the amino- and carboxyl- terminal fragments in-frame. The amplified DNA fragments were purified from agarose gel and inserted into eukaryotic TOPO-cloning expression vector pCDNA3.1/V5/His to generate fusion hVIP proteins containing polyhistidine tags at their carboxyl termini, according to the instructions provided by the supplier. Transformants were screened from LB-agar plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) plates, and all the mutant constructs were sequenced by automated sequencing to verify the integrity of the mutations. Using the TNT-coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), 35S-labeled protein products were generated using plasmids containing hVIP constructs and the vpr gene as templates. The reaction mix was prepared according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer, and the reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h. Equal amounts of in vitro-translated35S-labeled hVIP and HIV-1 Vpr were mixed and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in a binding buffer containing 25 mmHepes (pH 7.9), 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Respective antibodies were added to each tube with 150 μl of binding buffer and incubated for 90 min at 4 °C. Approximately 5 mg of protein A-Sepharose beads were added to each immunoprecipitation reaction from a freshly prepared stock solution (100 mg/ml), and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 90 min in a rotating shaker. The beads were washed three times with the binding buffer and finally suspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. The immunoprecipitated protein complexes were eluted from the Sepharose beads by being briefly boiled and then resolved using SDS/PAGE (15%) gels. The gel was fixed, treated with a 1 m sodium salicylate solution, and dried in a gel drier (Bio-Rad). The dried gel was exposed overnight to x-ray film and developed using an automated developer (Kodak). Radiolabeled GR protein sample was also prepared as described above. In vitro binding assay was performed to examine the physical interaction between hVIP and GR. The localization patterns of hVIP proteins in cells with or without the coexpression of Vpr protein were monitored by an indirect immunofluorescent assay approach. HeLa cells grown in slide chambers (BD PharMingen) were transfected with appropriate plasmids as outlined above. For 1 h prior to the transfection, the cells were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus (vFT7–3) that expresses recombinant RNA polymerase and then transfected overnight with either hVIP or Vpr expression vectors alone or in combination. The cells were fixed on slides using 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with appropriate primary antibodies for 45 min. Rabbit anti-HIV-1 Vpr and mouse anti-His tag (1:100 dilution) were used as primary antibodies. Following incubation with primary antibodies, the slides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min. DAPI (Sigma) was used to stain the nuclei with characteristic blue color. The slides were mounted with mounting media containing anti-fading reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc, Eugene, OR) for fluorescent microscopy, and the pictures were taken with appropriate filters. In vitro synthesis of 35S-labeled protein samples prepared from pchVIP and pcVpr were examined by gel electrophoresis and found to correspond to the appropriate molecular mass of the predicted proteins, thereby confirming the integrity of the constructs. Specifically, Vpr generated a 14-kDa protein, whereas hVIP moves at the expected 34,000. Staining pchVIP-transfected HeLa cells with a monoclonal anti-His tag antibody reveals a cytoplasmic localization (Fig. 1, C andD) for the full-length protein as previously described (34Ramanathan M.P. Ayyavoo V. Weiner D.B. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 101-106Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of vpr in the transfected cells reveals typical nuclear rim staining (Fig. 1, A andB), as previously reported (32Mahalingam S. Ayyavoo V. Patel M. Kieber-Emmons T. Kao G.D. Muschel R.J. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 3419-3424Google Scholar, 35Mahalingam S. Ayyavoo V. Patel M. Kieber-Emmons T. Weiner D.B. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6339-6347Google Scholar). Interestingly, co-expression of Vpr with hVIP significantly alters the localization pattern of this Vpr ligand. The cytoplasmic localization pattern of full-length hVIP protein was shifted to a clear nuclear localization pattern in cells expressing both hVIP or Vpr constructs overlapping with Vpr, while Vpr still maintains its perinuclear staining pattern (Fig. 1, E–H). This result supports that Vpr interferes with the localization pattern of hVIP. In Fig.2, a schematic plan on the construction of specific deletion mutants of hVIP is illustrated. During their construction, a polyhistidine tag was fused to the carboxyl terminus of the hVIP molecules for characterization studies. The expression of hVIP mutant constructs was initially confirmed by SDS gel analysis of35S-labeled in vitro-translated protein products. The mobility of the individual mutant molecules corresponds to their gene sequence. Monoclonal anti-His tag and polyclonal Vpr antibodies were used to monitor the expression of the hVIP constructs and the vpr gene, respectively. Interestingly, deletion mutagenesis induced significant changes in the localization pattern of some of the mutant molecules. Although the full-length hVIP is localized in the cytoplasm (Fig.3 A, hVIP-WT), hVIP with a deleted carboxyl-terminal portion (Fig. 3 F,hVIP-NM) as well as the mutant that has the central core domain deleted also localized in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3 K,hVIP-NC). Deletion of the amino-terminal domain resulted in nuclear localization (Fig. 3 P), and the expression of the carboxyl-terminal portion alone (Fig. 3 U, hVIP-C) revealed a cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly, mutants of the hVIP molecule differ in terms of their localization with the presence of Vpr protein. In Fig. 3, the full-length hVIP moves to the nucleus upon co-transfection with Vpr-expressing plasmid (Fig. 3, B–E). The mutant (hVIP-NM), which has a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal region, revealed a cytoplasmic localization when expressed alone; this localization pattern was not altered when this mutant was expressed in the presence of Vpr (Fig. 3, G–J). Thus, unlike the full-length hVIP, expression of vpr does not result in the translocation of this mutant completely from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Together with the expression of Vpr, the cytoplasmic localization of the hVIP mutant that has its middle core domain deleted is altered to localize in the nuclear region (Fig. 3, L–O). The amino-terminal-deleted mutant (hVIP-MC) was expressed clearly in the nucleus, regardless of the co-expression of vpr; hence, the presence of Vpr did not alter the localization pattern of this mutant (Fig. 3, Q–T). Interestingly, the carboxyl-terminal region is localized in the cytoplasm and is moved into the nucleus by the expression of Vpr (Fig. 3, V–Y). To confirm these relationships, a direct in vitro binding assay was performed. The interaction between hVIP molecules and Vpr was determined by immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE. Vpr was coimmunoprecipitated with the full-length hVIP molecule as previously reported. Additionally, four hVIP mutants also bound directly to Vpr. Only the mutant lacking the carboxyl-terminal region failed to interact with Vpr (Fig. 4). As a repeat control, anti-Vpr sera also was used to immunoprecipitate the complexes. Again the precipitation pattern for hVIP was consistent with the pattern revealed by the anti-His tag studies (data not shown). This analysis and the immunofluorescence analysis demonstrate that interaction of Vpr is distinct with hVIP and appears to be mediated through the carboxyl-terminal domain of hVIP. We have reported hVIP as a potential Vpr ligand and demonstrated its role in cell cycle regulation as antisense of this gene-induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase (32Mahalingam S. Ayyavoo V. Patel M. Kieber-Emmons T. Kao G.D. Muschel R.J. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 3419-3424Google Scholar), the stage where the expression of Vpr induces growth arrest (13Jowett J.B. Plannelles V. Poon B. Shah N.P. Chen M.L. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6304-6313Google Scholar, 14He J. Choe S. Walker R. Di Marzio P. Morgan D.O. Landau N.R. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6705-6711Google Scholar, 15Re F. Bratten D. Franke E.K. J. Luban L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 6859-6864Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the biology of hVIP-Vpr interaction, we investigated the effect of Vpr antagonists on hVIP function. Glucocorticoids have been demonstrated to mimic the effects of Vpr; mifepristone has been shown to revert these effects of Vpr (18Ayyavoo V. Mahboubi A. Mahalingam S. Ramalingam R. Kudchodkar S. Williams W.V. Green D.R. Weiner D.B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1117-1123Google Scholar, 22Ayyavoo V. Muthumani K. Kudchodkar S.B. Zhang D. Ramanathan M.P. Dayes N.S. Kim J.J. Sin J.I. Montaner L.J. Weiner D.B. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 13-22Google Scholar, 36Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Google Scholar, 37Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Pearce D. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2000. 2000; 74: 8159-8165Google Scholar). With this background, we examined whether mifepristone could block the nuclear translocation of hVIP induced by Vpr in cells. HeLa cells were co-transfected with pchVIP and pcVpr expression plasmids, and the localization pattern of hVIP was monitored under the influence of mifepristone. As witnessed previously, in the untreated cells hVIP was localized in the nucleus of the cells co-expressing both hVIP and Vpr. (Fig. 5,A–D). Interestingly, in the mifepristone-treated cells, hVIP was observed in the cytoplasm despite the co-expression of Vpr (Fig. 5, E–H). This result clearly demonstrates that mifepristone inhibits the translocation of hVIP induced by the expression of Vpr. The effects of Vpr on viral replication and host cell biology are mediated in part through the GR complex (22Ayyavoo V. Muthumani K. Kudchodkar S.B. Zhang D. Ramanathan M.P. Dayes N.S. Kim J.J. Sin J.I. Montaner L.J. Weiner D.B. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 13-22Google Scholar, 36Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Google Scholar). The relationship of hVIP to the GR pathway, if any, has not been previously explained. Accordingly, we looked for a direct effect of a glucocorticoid compound, dexamethasone, on the hVIP localization pattern in vivo. For this study, cells were transfected with hVIP or hVIP mutants and treated with dexamethasone. We examined the expression pattern of hVIP by immunofluorescent analysis 36 h later. Fig. 6,C and D clearly illustrates the alteration in the localization pattern of hVIP in cells treated with dexamethasone compared with the untreated cells. The effect of the glucocorticoid in moving hVIPmov34 to the nucleus was dose-dependent. We analyzed four different concentrations of dexamethasone (10, 25, 50, 100 nm). At the lowest concentration tested, only about 10% of the cells did not show a cytoplasmic localization pattern. Interestingly some cells (5%) appeared to show a confused stage where hVIPmov34 was initiating movement into the nucleus. Hence the protein stained both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (data not shown), whereas at the highest concentration tested, 50 nm, every cell that expressed hVIPmov34 showed typical nuclear staining of this protein. To further confirm this effect, we next sought to interfere with the activity of the glucocorticoid. Mifepristone has been reputed to have an antagonistic effect on glucocorticoid activities. We examined whether mifepristone would inhibit the dexamethasone-induced movement of hVIP into the nucleus. Dexamethasone failed to move hVIP under the influence of mifepristone (Fig. 6, E and F), as these cells displayed a clear cytoplasmic localization of this protein in the presence of both dexamethasone and mifepristone, which is distinct to cells treated with dexamethasone alone. Additionally the African green monkey cell line, CV-1, has been characterized as unable to respond to the effects of glucocorticoids (36Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Google Scholar, 37Sherman M.P. de Noronha C.M. Pearce D. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2000. 2000; 74: 8159-8165Google Scholar, 38Sawaya B.E. Khalili K. Gordon J. Taube R. Amini S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35209-35214Google Scholar) because it lacks a functional GR receptor complex. As an additional confirmation, we were interested in examining the dexamethasone effect on hVIP localization in this cell line. CV-1 cells were transfected with hVIP expression plasmids and either treated or mock-treated with dexamethasone. As would be expected in this glucocorticoid-negative cell line, both untreated and dexamethasone-treated cells displayed a similar cytoplasmic localization pattern for hVIP expression (Fig.7); typical solid nuclear staining was not witnessed in these cells. Therefore, in CV-1 cells dexamethasone was not effective in altering the localization pattern of hVIP. Collectively, these data support the interaction of hVIP with the GR pathway.Figure 7hVIP expression in CV-1 cells. CV-1 cells are known to be negatively responsive to glucocorticoid treatments because they lack the functional GR receptor complex. These cells were transfected with hVIP plasmids to study the expression pattern of hVIP under the influence of dexamethasone. Dexamethasone failed to move hVIP into the nucleus, as revealed by the cytoplasmic localization of hVIP in both untreated (A, B) and dexamethasone-treated (C, D) cells. hVIP expressing cells are marked.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In the next set of experiments, we determined whether the nuclear import of hVIP in the glucocorticoid-treated cells is mediated through direct interaction between hVIP and GR. We examined the ability of these two proteins to interact with each other using in vitro radiolabeled protein samples. In vitro-translated35S-labeled samples of GR and hVIP were mixed together and immunoprecipitated with either anti-GR or anti-His tag antibodies. We found that 35S-labeled hVIP was precipitated with GR by anti-GR antibody and GR was coimmunoprecipitated along with hVIP while anti-His tag was used. To determine cross-reactivity, we also checked the precipitation of hVIP by anti-GR antibody and vice versa. Anti-His tag and anti-GR antibodies failed to precipitate radiolabeled GR and hVIP proteins, respectively (Fig. 8). These data permit the conclusion that these two proteins interact with each other in an in vitro system also. Several features of Vpr activity have suggested that this protein interacts with a host cell ligand that participates in its transit from the host cytoplasm to the host nucleus. hVIP appears to be a candidate for part of this activity. Prior studies have shown that hVIP can interact with Vpr directly and that hVIP is important in its own right for cell cycle arrest (32Mahalingam S. Ayyavoo V. Patel M. Kieber-Emmons T. Kao G.D. Muschel R.J. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 98: 3419-3424Google Scholar). Here we sought to characterize the interaction between hVIP and Vpr. Experimental results presented here clearly indicate that the carboxyl-terminal region of hVIP mediates its interaction with Vprin vitro and in vivo (Figs. 3 and 4). Mutants of hVIP behave differently in terms of their localization patterns in cells transfected with these mutant constructs. The differential localization pattern supports the conclusion that the amino terminus of hVIP is important for its cytoplasmic localization, whereas the carboxyl terminus is more nucleophilic. These features likely may play a role in the shuttling of this protein between the nucleocytoplasmic compartments and likely have a crucial role in the natural function of this protein. By blast search, hVIP has homology with some of proteins involved in the initiation of the eukaryotic translation (33Asano K. Vornlocher H.P. Richter-Cook N.J. Merricj W.C. Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27042-27052Google Scholar) as well as in proteasome formation; these protein families have crucial roles during embryonic development in eukaryotes. The knockout of this gene in transgenic mice results in a lethal phenotype. Glucocorticoids regulate diverse functions and are important to maintain central nervous system, cardiovascular, metabolic, and immune homeostasis. They also exert anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, which have made them invaluable therapeutic agents in numerous diseases (39Chrousos G.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 332: 1351-1362Google Scholar). The actions of these hormones are mediated by their specific intracellular receptors, such as the GR. Several host co-activators of the GR have been described that directly interact with GR and components of the transcription initiation complex to enhance the glucocorticoid signal to the transcription machinery (40Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate T.E. Genster S.Y. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-164Google Scholar). The GR is the prototypic member of the translocating class of steroid receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in almost all human tissues and organs. Unliganded GR is found in the cytoplasm and moves rapidly into the nucleus in response to hormone stimulation (41Htun H. Barsony J. Renyi I. Gould D.L. Hager G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4845-4850Google Scholar, 42McNally J.G. Muller W.G. Walker D. Wolford R. Hager G.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1262-1265Google Scholar). Potential steroid hormone receptor antagonists such as mifepristone prevent the GR from moving into the nucleus in response to appropriate stimulation. In the present study, both HIV-1 Vpr and dexamethasone induce hVIP to move into the nucleus. Interestingly, mifepristone prevents the movement of hVIP into the nucleus in response to the treatment of the cells with a glucocorticoid as well as in response to the co-expression of Vpr plasmid from the vpr-expressing construct. Thus both Vpr and glucocorticoid exert a similar effect on hVIP. This observation assumes significance because it is consistent with earlier reports that Vpr mimics glucocorticoid effects on apoptosis and immune suppression that are inhibited by mifepristone (18Ayyavoo V. Mahboubi A. Mahalingam S. Ramalingam R. Kudchodkar S. Williams W.V. Green D.R. Weiner D.B. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1117-1123Google Scholar, 26Rafaeli Y. Levy D.N. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3621-3625Google Scholar). Interestingly, the hVIP mutant that has the carboxyl-terminal deletion exhibited resistance to translocation into the nucleus even when co-expressed with Vpr, unlike the full-length hVIP molecule. This mutant fails to bind Vpr. Dexamethasone also failed to effect the nuclear movement of this mutant. These data suggest that the carboxyl domain of hVIP may interact with a shuttling protein that is part of the GR complex and that this interaction is necessary for the movement of hVIP into the nucleus. The deletion of the carboxyl-terminal domain renders this hVIP mutant unable to bind the shuttle protein and thus the nuclear translocation of this mutant is impaired (Fig.9). Clearly, identification of this hVIP ligand will give important clues into Vpr and GR biology. Although convincing data advance a theory that Vpr mimics some glucocorticoid effects, it is also clear that Vpr interacts directly with members of the GR complex (26Rafaeli Y. Levy D.N. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3621-3625Google Scholar, 36Kino T. Gragerov A. Kopp J.B. Stauber R.H. Pavlakis G.N. Chrousos G.P. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 51-62Google Scholar). These findings suggest a clustered protein complex present in the cytoplasm that forms the cellular target to receive and transduce the signals triggered by Vpr as well as glucocorticoids (Fig. 10). GR interacts in the cytoplasm with a complex array of chaperone proteins, including HSP90 and HSP70, and ligand-dependent displacement of these proteins is thought to be intimately involved in the translocation process (43Bamberger C.M. Schulte H.M. Chrousos G.P. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 245-261Google Scholar, 44Beato M. Sanchez-Pacheco A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 587-609Google Scholar). Both GR and hVIP are known Vpr ligands. Further, in vitro binding analysis reveals a direct interaction between hVIP and GR. (Fig. 8). By responding to glucocorticoid activation, hVIP appears to have additional cellular roles besides its vital role in cell cycle regulation that was described earlier. Therefore, the further study of the biological relevance of hVIP-Vpr interaction has important implications for HIV biology and our understanding of the important host cell glucocorticoid receptor functions. The identification of hVIP as a target for GR interactions has important implications for our understanding of HIV biology. M. P. R. thanks Michael Chattergoon for critical suggestions.

A subset of TAFIIs are also found in a macromolecular complex containing Drosophilapolycomb group proteins (9Saurin A.J. Shao Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kingston R.E. Nature. 2001; 412: 655-660Google Scholar). The function of TAFIIs has been studied in several organisms. In yeast, the genes encoding all of the TFIID components, with the exception of yTAF14, are essential for viability. Genetic studies have shown that TAFIIs play an important role in transcriptional regulation of many genes (10Green M.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 59-63Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive (TS) mutations in yTAF1 and yTAF5 provoke cell cycle arrest where the expression of only a small number of genes is affected (11Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Google Scholar, 12Apone L.M. Virbasius C.M. Reese J.C. Green M.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2368-2380Google Scholar). In contrast, TS mutations in yTAF6, yTAF9, yTAF10, and yTAF12 or the TFIID-specific yTAF11 lead to a dramatic decrease in overall transcription levels (13Apone L.M. Virbasius C.A. Holstege F.C.

Studies in Drosophila have shown that TAFIIs are involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes during development (19Soldatov A. Nabirochkina E. Georgieva S. Belenkaja T. Georgiev P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3769-3778Google Scholar, 20Zhou J. Zwicker J. Szymanski P. Levine M. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13483-13488Google Scholar, 21Hernandez-Hernandez A. Ferrus A.

In mammalian cells, TAFIIs again seem to be involved in cell cycle control and are essential for the viability of proliferating cells (23Metzger D. Scheer E. Soldatov A. Tora L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4823-4834Google Scholar, 24Chen Z. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5064-5076Google Scholar, 25Sekiguchi T. Nohiro Y. Nakamura Y. Hisamoto N. Nishimoto T. Mol. Cell.

The histone-fold domain (HFD) plays an important role in the structural organization of TFIID. Sequence comparisons and structural studies indicated that TAF6 and TAF9 contain HFDs similar to those of core histones H4 and H3, which interact to form an H3-H4-like heterotetramer (27Xie X. Kokubo T. Cohen S.L. Mirza U.A. Hoffmann A. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Nakatani Y. Burley S.K. Nature. 1996; 380: 316-322Google Scholar, 28Hoffmann A. Chiang C.M. Oelgeschlager T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Google Scholar). hTAF4 and hTAF12 heterodimerize via HFDs similar to those of H2A and H2B, respectively (29Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the TAF6-TAF9 heterotetramer may associate with the TAF4-TAF12 heterodimer to form an octameric substructure within TFIID (28Hoffmann A. Chiang C.M. Oelgeschlager T. Xie X. Burley S.K. Nakatani Y. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 356-359Google Scholar, 29Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Google Scholar). The equivalent yTAFIIs have been shown to assemble in vitro to form a macromolecular complex with stoichiometry (yTAF6-yTAF9)2-2(yTAF4-yTAF12) consistent with that of a histone-like octamer (30Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Google Scholar). The possible existence of such a structurein vivo is supported by high copy suppressor genetic interactions in yeast (15Michel B. Komarnitsky P. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 663-673Google Scholar, 30Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Google Scholar) and the finding that these four yTAFIIs colocalize within the same subdomain of native yeast TFIID (31Leurent C. Sanders S. Ruhlman C. Mallouh V. Weil P.A. Kirschner D.B. Tora L. Schultz P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3424-3433Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography has shown that hTAF11 and hTAF13 heterodimerize via HFDs, and this interaction is in agreement with a correspondingin vivo genetic interaction between their yeast orthologues (14Komarnitsky P.B. Michel B. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2484-2489Google Scholar, 32Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Ruff M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Davidson I. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 94: 239-249Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have also indicated that yTAF3 and yTAF8 contain HFDs that heterodimerize with a HFD in yTAF10 (33Gangloff Y.G. Sanders S.L. Romier C. Kirschner D. Weil P.A. Tora L. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1841-1853Google Scholar). A similar result was obtained in studies of their metazoan orthologues (21Hernandez-Hernandez A. Ferrus A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 614-623Google Scholar, 34Gangloff Y.G. Pointud J.C. Thuault S. Carre L. Romier C. Muratoglu S. Brand M. Tora L. Couderc J.L. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5109-5121Google Scholar). The existence of these heterodimers in native yeast TFIID is supported by immunoelectron microscopy, which shows colocalization of these proteins (31Leurent C. Sanders S. Ruhlman C. Mallouh V. Weil P.A. Kirschner D.B. Tora L. Schultz P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3424-3433Google Scholar). Hence, nine yTAFIIs contain HFDs that specifically heterodimerize to form five histone-like pairs (for review, see Ref. 3Gangloff Y. Romier C. Thuault S. Werten S. Davidson I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 250-257Google Scholar). TSG2/yTAF4 shows significant sequence similarity to the metazoan TAF4 and TAF4b proteins (35Reese J.C. Zhang Z. Kurpad H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17391-17398Google Scholar, 36Sanders S.L. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13895-13900Google Scholar). Overexpression of yTAF4 suppresses the TS phenotype of a mutation in yTAF12, and these TAFIIs interact physically with one another (30Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Google Scholar, 35Reese J.C. Zhang Z. Kurpad H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17391-17398Google Scholar), although the precise domains required for their interaction have not been described. Although the yTAF4 HFD shows sequence similarity to those of its metazoan counterparts, additional shared regions of similarity exist in the C terminus. To better understand the function of each region and their contribution to heterodimerization with yTAF12, we have made a detailed structure-function analysis of yTAF4. We show that the HFD is essential, but not sufficient, for yTAF4 function, which additionally requires the short highly conserved C-terminal domain (CCTD) and the intervening linker region. We demonstrate a strong genetic interaction between the yTAF4 CCTD and yTAF12 in vivo, and coexpression in Escherichia coli shows that the CCTD also contributes to direct yTAF4-yTAF12 heterodimerization in vitro. Together with the structure of the orthologous hTAF4-hTAF12 heterodimer (48Werten S. Mitschler A. Romier C. Gangloff Y.-G. Thuault S. Davidson I. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45502-45509Google Scholar), our results provide evidence that the α3 helix of the TAF4 HFD is located within the CCTD and reveal a novel HFD organization in which the α2 helix is separated from the α3 helix by an extended L2 loop containing a functional domain. The yeast strains used in this study are: YSLS46 (MATaleu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 KANΔtaf4 [pRS416ADH-TAF4]), used for plasmid shuffling of TAF4, was derived from YSLS40 (36Sanders S.L. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13895-13900Google Scholar) by sporulation and tetrad dissection; YSLS46/4 (MATaleu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 KANΔtaf4 [pAS3-TAF4]); YSLS46/4m4(MATaleu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 KANΔtaf4 [pAS3-TAF4(M219P)]); YSLS46/4 (186–388) (MATaleu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 KANΔtaf4 [pAS3-TAF4 (186–388)]); and YSLS46/4m5(MATaleu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 his3Δ1 met15Δ0 KANΔtaf4 [pAS3-TAF4 (186–388)(R362A, D363A)]). All yeast and bacterial expression vectors were constructed by PCR using oligonucleotide primers with the appropriate restriction sites (details available on request). All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and automated sequencing. For complementation experiments, wild-type or mutated TAFIIs were cloned in pAS3 with a Leu marker as previously described (33Gangloff Y.G. Sanders S.L. Romier C. Kirschner D. Weil P.A. Tora L. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1841-1853Google Scholar). A low copy expression plasmid containing the native yTAF4 promoter was constructed by introducing a cassette comprising 500 bp of sequence upstream of the yTAF4 ATG into the pRS415 vector (37Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene. 1995; 156: 119-122Google Scholar) (pRS415taf4p). Downstream of the ATG, a sequence encoding the FLAG epitope was inserted followed by restriction sites allowing the in-frame cloning of the wild-type or mutated yTAF4 derivatives. All strains were transformed by the LiAc technique. For complementation assays, the indicated plasmids were transformed and the wild-type yTAF4 URA3 plasmid was shuffled out by two passes on media containing 5-fluororotic acid as previously described (33Gangloff Y.G. Sanders S.L. Romier C. Kirschner D. Weil P.A. Tora L. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1841-1853Google Scholar). For suppression of the yTAF4 mutant strains, cells were transformed with high-copy-number vectors with URA3 or HIS3 markers expressing the indicated yTAFII. Transformed yeast were then grown at the indicated temperatures. In all experiments, cultures were grown in yeast extract-peptone dextrose medium. Auxotrophic selections were performed in the appropriate synthetic dextrose medium. Total RNA was isolated from strains grown at the indicated temperatures for the indicated times as described above. In each case the cultures were immediately cooled, pelleted for 5 min at 4000 rpm, washed twice in cold H2O, repelleted, and frozen at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated by the hot phenol/chloroform method and subsequently quantified (38Schroeder S.C. Weil P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4186-4195Google Scholar). Analysis of poly(A)+ RNA was performed on slot blots by hybridization with an oligo(dT) probe and quantified by Phosphorimager analysis (Amersham Biosciences) as previously described (18Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Google Scholar). All samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the average values ± standard error are shown. Coexpression inE. coli was performed as previously described (29Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Google Scholar). The derivative of yTAF12 was expressed as a histidine-tagged fusion protein in pET-15b. Native untagged derivatives of yTAF4 were expressed from a modified version of the vector pACYC184 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (39Fribourg S. Romier C. Werten S. Gangloff Y.G. Poterszman A. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 363-373Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of yTAF4 to those of its metazoan orthologues hTAF4, dTAF4, and hTAF4b indicates strong similarity in the C-terminal domain of the proteins. This region can be divided into three sub-domains, the HFD, a short strongly conserved domain at the extreme C terminus (Conserved C-Terminal Domain, CCTD), and an intervening linker region (Fig.1). To address the requirement of these domains for function in vivo, a set of deletion mutants were constructed (Fig. 2 A) and tested for their ability to rescue the growth of the yeasttaf4Δ null strain.Figure 2Schematic description of yTAF4 deletion mutants. A, yeast TAF4 is schematically depicted. Non-conserved regions are shown as a thin black line, the linker region between the HFD and the CCTD as athick black line, the α-helices of the HFD are indicated as dark blue boxes, and the CCTD by alight blue box. In yTAF4c1–3, the hTAF4 CCTD and/or α3 helices are differentiated from their yTAF4 counterparts bycoloring and in yTAF4c2 and c3 the hTAF4 linker region is shown by an open box. The presence of substituted amino acids is indicated with an asterisk. The amino acid coordinates of the deletion end points, the HFD, and the CCTD are indicated. The ability of each construct to complement the growth of the taf4Δ strain when expressed from a high copy vector or a low copy vector under the control of the TAF4 promoter is indicated to the right. TS indicates temperature sensitive growth.B, the location of amino acid substitutions within the HFD and CCTD is indicated. The wild-type amino acid sequence is indicated on the first line and the mutated residues are shown below.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In plasmid shuffle experiments, full-length wild-type yTAF4 rescued the growth of the taf4Δ null strain (Fig.3 A, sector 1, summarized in Fig. 2 A), although no rescue was seen with the expression vector alone (Fig. 3 A, sector 2). Growth was also seen when the non-conserved N-terminal region upstream of the HFD was deleted (Fig. 3 A, sector 4 and Fig. 3 B, sector 1; yTAF4 (186–388)). Similarly, deletion of the α1 helix and the α1 helix and loop L1 of the HFD did not abolish yTAF4 function (Fig. 3 B, sectors 2 and 3; yTAF4 (203–388) and yTAF4 (213–388)), which was lost upon additional deletion of the N-terminal half of the α2 helix (Fig. 3 B, sector 4; yTAF4 (231–388), summarized in Fig. 2 A). In agreement with the observation that the α1 helix could be deleted without abolishing function, a mutation within this helix also did not affect growth (Fig. 2 B,yTAF4m3 and Fig. 3 A, sector 8). In contrast, mutations in the α2 helix either completely abolished function (Fig. 2 B, yTAF4m1, m2 and Fig. 3 A, sectors 6 and 7) or led to a TS phenotype (yTAF4m4, Fig. 3 C, sector 1). Hence, the central α2 helix of the HFD is critical for yTAF4 function. Surprisingly however, mutation (yTAF4 (186–388)m6, Fig. 2,A and B) or deletion (yTAF4Δ (251–261), Fig.2 A) of the α3 helix did not affect the ability to efficiently complement (Fig. 3 E, sectors 2 and3, summarized in Fig. 2 A). Although the above results show that yTAF4 HFD is required for function, no complementation is seen with the construct yTAF4 (186–280) containing the HFD alone (Fig. 3 A, sector 3), indicating that the linker region and/or the CCTD are also required. Indeed, deletion of the CCTD completely abolished function (Fig. 3 A, sector 5; yTAF4 (1–356)). Mutation of two highly conserved residues within the yTAF4 CCTD led to a TS phenotype when introduced into the (186–388) deletion mutant (Fig.3 C, sector 2; mutation yTAF4 (186–388)m5). In addition, deletion of the linker region between the presumed α3 helix of the HFD and the CCTD led to a loss of function (yTAF4Δ (288–329), summarized in Fig. 2 A). Similarly, deletion of the entire linker region and the presumed α3 helix (yTAF4Δ (251–358), Fig.2 A), which brings the CCTD into close proximity to the α2 helix (see also below), also led to a loss of function (Fig.3 E, sector 4). Interestingly, neither the hTAF4 CCTD alone, nor the combination of the hTAF4 CCTD and linker regions can substitute for the equivalent yTAF4 regions and support yeast growth (yTAF4c1 and yTAF4c2, Fig. 3 B, sector 5and Fig. 3 E, sector 5). Finally, exchanging the yTAF4 linker region by that of hTAF4 did not permit complementation (yTAF4c3, Fig. 3 E, sector 6). Some of the above complementation results were performed with a high copy expression vector containing the strong alcohol dehydrogenase promoter. To exclude the possibility that some of the derivatives may complement due to increased expression, those bearing deletion and point mutations for which complementation was observed were also expressed under the control of the natural yTAF4 promoter sequence in a low copy vector (as described under “Experimental Procedures”). As observed above, wild-type yTAF4 and the (186–388) derivative containing only the conserved regions both supported growth (Fig.3 D, sector 1 and 7). When expressed from this vector, deletion or mutation of the α1 helix did not affect complementation (summarized in Fig. 2 A and 3 F,sector 3). However, deletion of the α1 helix and L1 loop of the HFD led to impaired growth at 28 °C and a TS phenotype (Fig.3 D, sector 6 and Fig. 3 F, sector 4). Similar to the high copy vector, complementation and a TS phenotype were observed with yTAF4 (186–388)m5 (Fig. 3 D,sector 3 and Fig. 3 F, sector 5). No TS phenotype was, however, observed when the mutation was introduced in the context of the full-length protein (Fig. 3 F, yTAF4 (1–388)m5). The only significant difference with the low copy vector was observed with yTAF4 (1–388)m4 containing a mutation in the α2 helix. When expressed from a high copy expression vector, this derivative complemented at 28 °C and led to a TS phenotype (summarized in Fig. 2 A), whereas when expressed from the low copy vector, no complementation was seen (Fig. 3 D,sectors 4 and 5). Taken together, the above results show that the α2 helix of the HFD is critical for function, but that the α1 helix is not absolutely required. The CCTD and the intervening region are also essential domains, because their deletion results in a loss of function even when expressed from a high copy vector. Therefore, the evolutionarily conserved regions of yTAF4 all contribute to function in vivo. As shown above, we have isolated mutations in the CCTD or in the HFD with a TS phenotype. We overexpressed the other histone-like yTAFIIs in strains harboring each mutation in order to test their ability to suppress this TS phenotype and hence to interact genetically with yTAF4. With the strain harboring the yTAF4 (1–388)m4 mutation in the HFD, overexpression of wild-type yTAF4 efficiently rescued growth as expected (summarized in Fig.4 A). However, of the other yTAFIIs tested, only the expression of yTAF12 was able to rescue the growth at the non-permissive temperature, whereas all strains grew at the permissive temperature (summarized in Fig.4 A). A similar result was obtained using mutation yTAF4 (186–388)m5 in the CCTD (Fig. 4, A and B). These results show strong and selective genetic interactions between yTAF12 and the HFD and CCTD of yTAF4. Direct physical interactions between yTAF4 and yTAF12 have previously been observed (30Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Google Scholar, 35Reese J.C. Zhang Z. Kurpad H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17391-17398Google Scholar), however, the domains of yTAF4 required for this have not been determined. To address this question, yTAF4 deletion mutants were tested for their ability to heterodimerize with a histidine-tagged derivative of the yTAF12 HFD when coexpressed in E. coli, a powerful method for investigating heterodimerization of TAFIIs (33Gangloff Y.G. Sanders S.L. Romier C. Kirschner D. Weil P.A. Tora L. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1841-1853Google Scholar, 39Fribourg S. Romier C. Werten S. Gangloff Y.G. Poterszman A. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 363-373Google Scholar). After coexpression, the bacterial extracts were separated on cobalt agarose beads, and the retained proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. When coexpressed with the histidine-tagged yTAF12 (409–491), efficient heterodimerization was observed with full-length wild-type yTAF4, which was retained on the beads only in the presence of yTAF12 (Fig.5 B, lanes 2 and 3). As previously observed with other HFDs, coexpression and heterodimerization also led to an increase in solubility of the yTAF12 HFD (lanes 1 and 3). Heterodimerization was also observed with yTAF4 (144–388) in which the N-terminal region has been deleted (lane 5). In contrast, only small amounts of heterodimer were seen with the construct yTAF4 (144–280) in which the conserved C-terminal sequence was deleted (lane 7). We also tested the ability of several other constructs equivalent to those tested in the complementation experiments for their ability to heterodimerize. Deletion of the linker region between the presumed α3 helix and the CCTD resulted in efficient production of the heterodimer (yTAF4 (144–388)Δ1,lane 9), showing that this domain is not required for heterodimerization. Moreover, a deletion of the presumed α3 helix and linker region, leaving only a short loop region and bringing the CCTD in close proximity to the α2 helix also resulted in highly efficient heterodimer production (yTAF4 (144–388)Δ2, lane 11). These results show that deletion of the CCTD, but not the linker region strongly impairs heterodimer production while bringing the CCTD close to the α2 helix results in highly efficient heterodimer production. Heterodimerization with yTAF12 was strongly impaired by mutations m1, m2, and m4 within the α2 helix of the yTAF4 HFD (Fig. 5 C,lanes 1–3). Similarly, mutation m5 in the CCTD and replacement of the yTAF4 CCTD by that of hTAF4 (yTAF4 c1) also impaired heterodimerization compared with that seen with the equivalent wild-type construction (compare lanes 4,5, and 6). This observation shows that the CCTD plays a direct role in heterodimerization with yTAF12. Here we describe two novel TS mutants in yTAF4. To determine the effect of each mutation on overall RNA polymerase II transcription, the levels of poly(A)+ RNA were examined in each strain following the shift to 37 °C. As a control in these experiments, we included the previously characterized yTAF10 mutant strain (G210E) bearing a mutation in the HFD. In this strain, bulk poly(A)+ levels are strongly reduced (18Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from each yeast strain grown at 28 °C, and after growth at 37 °C for between 15 min and 2 h, poly(A)+ levels were quantified by hybridization with an oligo(dT) probe and PhosphorImaging. As previously described, the level of poly(A)+ mRNA fell off rapidly to less than 25% of the control value after shift of the yTAF10(G210E) mutant strain to 37 °C (Fig.6). Mutation of the CCTD also led to a strong reduction in poly(A)+ mRNA levels, which decreased to around 30% (Fig. 6). In contrast, the mutation in the α2 helix of the HFD had a less dramatic effect (Fig. 6). These results show that the integrity of the CCTD is rather broadly required for transcription. In this report, we show that the conserved region of yTAF4 is required for yeast viability. We demonstrate that the CCTD of yTAF4 interacts genetically with yTAF12, is broadly required for transcription in vivo, and is required for optimal heterodimerization with yTAF12 in vitro. Together with the structure of the human TAF4-TAF12 heterodimer in the accompanying paper (48Werten S. Mitschler A. Romier C. Gangloff Y.-G. Thuault S. Davidson I. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45502-45509Google Scholar), our results provide evidence that the HFD of the TAF4 family has an unexpected organization where the α3 helix is located within the CCTD. We have previously proposed that TAF4 contains a HFD that mediates heterodimerization with that of TAF12 (29Gangloff Y.G. Werten S. Romier C. Carre L. Poch O. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 340-351Google Scholar). Analysis of yTAF4 shows that the HFD is essential for functionin vivo. Mutations in the α2 helix of the HFD abolish function or lead to a TS phenotype. These mutations also impair heterodimerization in in vitro coexpression experiments. In parallel with our study, the x-ray crystal structure of the hTAF4-hTAF12 histone-like pair was determined (48Werten S. Mitschler A. Romier C. Gangloff Y.-G. Thuault S. Davidson I. Moras D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45502-45509Google Scholar), indicating that hTAF12 adopts a canonical histone fold and showing the presence of an α1-L1-α2 in hTAF4. From the structure, it can be seen that the above mutations are indeed located within the heterodimerization interface. The correlation with complementation indicates that yTAF4-yTAF12 heterodimerization is essential for function in vivo. It is, however, surprising that deletion or mutation of the α1 helix that contributes significantly to the heterodimerization interface seen in the structure does not have a more radical effect. In contrast to yTAF12, yTAF10, or yTAF3 (16Moqtaderi Z. Keaveney M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 675-682Google Scholar, 17Natarajan K. Jackson B.M. Rhee E. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 683-692Google Scholar, 18Sanders S.L. Klebanow E.R. Weil P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18847-18850Google Scholar, 33Gangloff Y.G. Sanders S.L. Romier C. Kirschner D. Weil P.A. Tora L.

Biol. 2001; 22: 3178-3193Google Scholar), the previously ascribed yTAF4 HFD is not by itself sufficient for growth, which requires the entire conserved C-terminal region. Deletion of the CCTD results in a loss of function. Impaired heterodimerization with yTAF12 is also seen when the CCTD is deleted and with mutant m5 in the CCTD which shows a TS phenotype in vivo. The yTAF4c1 in which the yTAF4 CCTD is replaced by that of hTAF4 does not complementin vivo and displays impaired heterodimerization. The hTAF4 and yTAF4 CCTDs are closely related but not identical. There are several amino acid substitutions and an additional amino acid in the human sequence. Any one or several of these evolutionary changes may hinder heterodimerization and any other function(s) of the CCTD and lead to a loss of the ability to complement. In contrast to the above, deletion of the linker region does not affect heterodimerization but abolishes function in vivo. Hence, this loss of function cannot be ascribed to a loss of heterodimerization with yTAF12 suggesting that the conserved linker region plays a distinct role in vivo perhaps interacting with other TFIID subunits or mediating interactions of TFIID with other cellular proteins. As for the CCTD, species specificity is also observed, as the hTAF4 linker region cannot substitute for the equivalent region of yTAF4. Mutation of the yTAF4 CCTD has a dramatic effect on bulk mRNA levels upon shift to 37 °C, indicating that this domain is rather broadly required for transcription. This mutation is more detrimental than the m4 mutation in the yTAF4 HFD. However, it is important to note that the m5 mutation is present in the context of a deletion of the N-terminal region. In fact, the m5 mutation has an effect only in this context, but not in the context of the full-length protein. The fact that deletion of the N-terminal region alone has no effect suggests that there is a sequence within the N-terminal region, perhaps an additional αN helix as found in histone H3 or hTAF11 (32Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Ruff M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Davidson I. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 94: 239-249Google Scholar), which plays a partially redundant role with the CCTD and can suppress the effect of mutation, but not deletion of the CCTD. Nevertheless, our results suggest that distinct mutations within yTAF4 can have differential effects on gene expression, a conclusion confirmed by gene-specific effects of these yTAF4 mutations. 2S. T. and I. D., manuscript in preparation. The conclusion that the full spectrum of activity of a given TAF cannot be derived from the study of a single mutated allele has been underscored by analysis of distinct mutations in yTAF10 or yTAF5, which have dramatically different effects both on gene transcription and cell-cycle progression (40Kirschner D. Saunders S.L. Vom Bauer E. Gangloff Y.-G. Davidson I. Weil P.A. Tora L. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2001; 22: 3178-3193Google Scholar, 41Kirchner J. Sanders S.L. Klebanow E. Weil P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6668-6680Google Scholar, 42Durso R.J. Fisher A.K. Albright-Frey T.J. Reese J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7331-7344Google Scholar). A mutation in the yTAF4 α2 helix (M219P) leads to a TS phenotype. The introduction of proline residues in the α2 helix of several other yTAFIIs has also previously been shown to generate TS phenotypes and has proven useful for examining genetic interactions in yeast (15Michel B. Komarnitsky P. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 663-673Google Scholar, 33Gangloff Y.G. Sanders S.L. Romier C. Kirschner D. Weil P.A. Tora L. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1841-1853Google Scholar). Using the TS mutation in the yTAF4 α2 helix, we find a strong and selective genetic interaction with yTAF12, whose overexpression rescues the growth at restrictive temperature. These results are complementary to those of Reese et al. (35Reese J.C. Zhang Z. Kurpad H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17391-17398Google Scholar), who have shown that overexpression of yTAF4 could rescue the TS phenotype of a yTAF12 TS mutant containing a partial deletion of the α3 helix. Hence, there is a reciprocal genetic interaction in vivo between the HFDs of yTAF4 and yTAF12, suggesting that this pair exists within the native TFIID. The existence of this pair in vivo is also supported by the colocalization of yTAF4 and yTAF12 observed in immunoelectron microscopy within native yeast TFIID (31Leurent C. Sanders S. Ruhlman C. Mallouh V. Weil P.A. Kirschner D.B. Tora L. Schultz P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3424-3433Google Scholar). Our results extend those cited above by demonstrating a further selective genetic interaction between yTAF12 and the yTAF4 CCTD. While this work was in progress, Selleck et al. (30Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Google Scholar) reported that a TS mutation in the HFD of yTAF4 could be suppressed by overexpression of yTAF12. A reevaluation of this observation (43Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 231Google Scholar) indicates that the mutation conferring temperature sensitivity to this yTAF4 derivative is L365P, which does not lie within the presumed HFD region, but within the CCTD (see Fig. 1 B). This observation provides independent corroboration of a genetic interaction between yTAF12 and the yTAF4 CCTD. Given this strong genetic interaction, it was not surprising to find that yTAF4 directly heterodimerizes with yTAF12 when coexpressed inE. coli. These results extend those of Reese et al. (35Reese J.C. Zhang Z. Kurpad H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17391-17398Google Scholar),who showed an interaction between yTAF4 and yTAF12 in glutathione S-transferase-pulldown experiments. Sellecket al. (30Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Google Scholar) have reported heterodimerization of full-length yTAF4 and an N-terminally deleted derivative of yTAF12 upon coexpression in E. coli. Here we show that heterodimerization requires only the yTAF12 HFD, but that for yTAF4 the CCTD is additionally required. Full-length yTAF4 or only the conserved region heterodimerize efficiently with the HFD of yTAF12. In contrast, with only the yTAF4 HFD greatly reduced production of the heterodimer was obtained. Mutations in the CCTD impaired heterodimerization, whereas deletion of the presumed α3 helix as well as the linker region did not impair heterodimer production, but rather led to an optimal yield. Hence, when the CCTD is deleted or mutated, but not when the intervening linker region including the putative α3 helix is deleted, a reduction in heterodimer production is observed. This observation is in agreement with genetic suppressor results in vivo and shows that the CCTD directly contributes to efficient heterodimerization with yTAF12. With the determination of the hTAF4-hTAF12 structure, it was noted that the amino acids encoding the presumed hTAF4 α3 helix were present within the crystal, but were disorganized, suggesting that this region probably does not correspond to the α3 helix. Therefore, either hTAF4 belongs to a novel class of HFD which does not contain an α3 helix or an α3 helix is located elsewhere within the C-terminal domain. Several observations made during the analysis of yTAF4 suggest that an α3 helix is located within the CCTD. The CCTD is highly conserved in the TAF4 family. Within the CCTD, a region of strong similarity to other experimentally determined HFD α3 helices can be observed with a conserved D(L/V/M/I) pair (Fig. 1 B). This Asp residue, which is mutated in our m5 derivative plays an important role in several HFDs by forming an intramolecular bond with an arginine residue in the L2 loop, whereas the L365P mutation described by Sellecket al. (30Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Google Scholar) is located immediately following the DL pair (see asterisks in Fig. 1 B). Hence, the mutations conferring a TS phenotype and impairing heterodimerization lie within a region showing high sequence similarity to known α3 helices (Fig.1 B). The suppression of these mutations upon overexpression of yTAF12 and the impaired heterodimerization seen in vitroprovides strong evidence that this is indeed the α3 helix of the TAF4 HFD. In contrast, deletion or mutation of the previously ascribed α3 helix has no effect on yTAF4 function in vivo and does not affect heterodimerization in vitro. Together, these observations point to the possible presence of an α3 helix within the CCTD, showing that the TAF4 HFD has an unexpected organization with an extended linker between the α2 and α3 helices. The presence of an extended L2 loop within the HFD of yTAF10 and yTAF11 has previously been noted (30Selleck W. Howley R. Fang Q. Podolny V. Fried M.G. Buratowski S. Tan S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 695-700Google Scholar, 33Gangloff Y.G. Sanders S.L. Romier C. Kirschner D. Weil P.A. Tora L. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1841-1853Google Scholar, 40Kirschner D. Saunders S.L. Vom Bauer E. Gangloff Y.-G. Davidson I. Weil P.A. Tora L. Mol. Cel. Biol. 2001; 22: 3178-3193Google Scholar). However, in contrast to yTAF4, these loops are not present in the metazoan orthologues and can be deleted in the yeast proteins without loss of function. In the TAF4 family, the extended loop region is conserved and cannot be deleted without loss of function. Hence, the yTAF4 HFD has a novel organization in which a functional domain is located within the L2 loop. In addition to mediating heterodimerization with TAF12, the conserved region of TAF4 also mediates interaction with the Q-rich region of the cAMP-response element-binding protein transcriptional activator (44Asahara H. Santoso B. Guzman E. Du K. Cole P.A. Davidson I. Montminy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7892-7900Google Scholar). It has been suggested that proteins harboring poly(Q) expansions interact with the conserved region of TAF4 and provoke the development of neurodegenerative diseases by sequestration of TAF4 and interference with cAMP-response element-binding protein function (45Shimohata T. Nakajima T. Yamada M. Uchida C. Onodera O. Naruse S. Kimura T. Koide R. Nozaki K. Sano Y. Ishiguro H. Sakoe K. Ooshima T. Sato A. Ikeuchi T. Oyake M. Sato T. Aoyagi Y. Hozumi I. Nagatsu T. Takiyama Y. Nishizawa M. Goto J. Kanazawa I. Davidson I. Tanese N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 29-36Google Scholar). Moreover, TAF4 interacts with the adenovirus E1A protein, and this interaction absolutely requires the CCTD (46Mazzarelli J.M. Mengus G. Davidson I. Ricciardi R.P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7978-7983Google Scholar). Finally, the TAF4 linker and CCTD regions interact with the general transcription factor TFIIA (47Guermah M. Tao Y. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6882-6894Google Scholar). Given this plethora of interactions, it is not surprising that the conserved region of TAF4 has a complex organization and contains several functional elements. We thank L.

A DNA fragment corresponding to exon 7 of the human ABO gene was amplified from Wistar rat genomic DNA and sequenced. Using the amplified fragments as a probe for Southern blotting, multiple hybridized bands appeared on both EcoRI- and BamHI-digested genomes of seven rat strains, which showed variations in the band numbers among the strains. Four cDNAs were cloned from a Wistar rat, three of which showed A-transferase activity and one of which showed B-transferase activity. These activities were dependent on the equivalent residues at 266 and 268 of human ABO transferase. Wild Wistar rats expressed A-antigen in salivary gland, intestine, and urinary bladder tissue, but B-antigen was not stained in any organs studied, whereas a transcript from the ABO homologue with B-transferase activity was ubiquitous. Human A-transferase and B-transferase were transferred into Wistar rats. A-transgenic rats expressed A-antigen in ectopic tissue of the brain plexus, type II lung epithelium, pancreas, and epidermis.

Histo-blood group ABH antigens are important not only for blood transfusion but also for organ transplantation. The structures of the epitopes have been defined as trisaccharide determinants (1Hakomori S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 247-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), GalNAcα1′3(Fucα1′2)Gal- for A, Galα1′3(Fucα1′2)Gal- for B, and Fucα1′2Gal- for H. The determinants are synthesized by the products of the ABO locus, which encodes three alleles. The A allele produces α1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase (A-transferase), 1The abbreviations used for: A-transferase, α1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase; B-transferase, α1,3-galactosaminyl transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; FUT1, H-fructosyltransferase; Tg, transgenic. 1The abbreviations used for: A-transferase, α1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine transferase; B-transferase, α1,3-galactosaminyl transferase; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; FUT1, H-fructosyltransferase; Tg, transgenic. which catalyzes the transfer of GalNAc residues from the UDP-GalNAc donor nucleotide to the Gal residues of the acceptor H-antigen. The B allele encodes α1,3-galactosaminyl transferase (B-transferase), which catalyzes the transfer of Gal residues from the UDP-Gal donor nucleotide to the Gal residues of the acceptor H-antigen. The O allele lacks both enzymatic activities for the one base deletion causing a frameshift. Natural antibodies against both A- and B-antigens are produced in all individuals with type O blood and the antibodies against A or B are produced in individuals with type B or type A blood, respectively. Because most of the serum antibodies are composed of IgM, ABO-mismatched transfused red blood cells or endothelium from transplanted organs reacts with recipient antibodies and the antibody activates a compliment cascade. Therefore, if anti-A or anti-B antibodies in the recipients are not sufficiently removed by immunoadsorbence or a plasma exchange procedure, the graft organs are rejected in a hyperacute mode (2Cooper D.K. J. Heart Transplant. 1990; 9: 376-381PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tanabe K. Takahashi K. Agishi T. Toma H. Ota K. Transfus. Sci. 1996; 17: 455-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To improve the clinical management of transplantation, development of ABO-mismatched animal models is desirable. Rats are more suitable for ordinary examination of organ transplantation because of the larger body size compared with mice (4Hakamata Y. Tahara K. Uchida H. Sakuma Y. Nakamura M. Kume A. Murakami T.

To evaluate the availability of rats as an animal model, we studied the rat ABO homologue and established human A- and B-transferase transgenic rats. Besides the clinical importance of ABH antigens, those physiologic functions are still under investigation. The ABH antigens are distributed in the human body in a tissue-specific manner (5Watkins W.M. Montreuil H. Vliegenhart J.F.G. Schachter H. Glycoproteins. Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1995: 313-390Google Scholar). During fetal development, marked changes in antigen expression have been observed (6Szulman A.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1980; 14: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ABH antigen alteration in cancer cells associate with the patient prognosis. An ABH sugar chain affects cell-to-cell interaction through modification of integrin receptor function on human cancer cells (7Hakomori S. Adv.

Immunology. 1993; 78: 303-307PubMed Google Scholar) have been reported. However, the molecular basis of them has not been defined. In the present study, multiple rat orthologues are demonstrated to be a paralogous gene family with distinct expression profiles. Until now, ABO orthologues cloned in other animals have been a single-locus gene. The antigen expression in wild rats and the effect of exogenous human genes will shed light on the function and the evolution of the ABO gene in primates. Rat genomic DNA was extracted from the following rat strains: outbred Wistar, inbred DA/Slc, inbred LEW/Crj, inbred PVG/Sea, inbred ACI/N Slc, inbred SD, and inbred BN/Crj, which were maintained at Charles River Japan, Inc. (Yokohama, Japan). A DNA fragment corresponding to exon 7 of the human ABO gene was amplified from Wistar rat genomic DNA by PCR using a primer pair (sense, CAGAGCAGCACTTCATGGTGG, homologous to nucleotides 408 to 428, and antisense, GGGCCAGCCCAGCAGCTGCTGGTCCCA, complementary to nucleotides 970 to 996 of the human ABO cDNA). The PCR product was subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced using a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) by a capillary sequencer CEQ2000 (Beckman). The rat genome DNA from the seven strains was digested by restriction enzymes, EcoRI or BamHI. The genome DNA fragments separated by agarose gel were blotted onto a membrane and hybridized with the 32P-labeled PCR products. According to the results of the genome sequence, four clone-specific reverse primers were prepared for 5′-rapid amplification of a cDNA ends (RACE) procedure. Sense primers for 3′-RACE were then designed on sequences of the 5′-RACE. The RACE procedures were carried out using a MarathonTM cDNA amplification kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) and rat intestinal poly(A)+ RNA with the following primers: antisense, ATGGACACGTCCTGCCAGCGA, CACACCAGGTAATCCACTTCATA, TAAAGGACTCCCGTTGGCTACT, and CCCATATAGTAAAAGTCACCCTGG, and sense, CTATGGATTCCTGAGCCACAGAA, GTTCCTGAGCCACAGATTCCAT, GTTATGGGTTCCTGAGCCACAA, and TTTGCTTCGTGTGCCTGAGCCTCAG. The PCR products were subcloned, and 18 to 34 clones of each fragment were sequenced on both strands. The sequences were aligned by DNASIS-Mac software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co., Ltd., Hitachi, Japan) and GENETYX-Mac (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The organ distribution of rat ABO homologues was determined by multiplex RT-PCR with the primers for the RACE procedure and rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The total template RNAs were prepared from 15 Wistar rat organs: brain, submandibular gland, heart, lung, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, pancreas, spleen, kidney, urinary bladder, testis, skin, and bone marrow. The PCR products were semiquantified by gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining. Full-length cDNAs of rat ABO homologues were prepared by high fidelity RT-PCR with primers specific for 5′ and 3′ ends of each clone. Rat ABO homologues, human A-cDNA, and human B-cDNA were inserted into pCR3 (Invitrogen), and H-fructosyltransferase (FUT1) cDNA was inserted in pSSRα−bsr vector (15Iwamoto S. Yamasaki M. Kawano M. Okuda H. Omi T. Takahashi J. Tani Y. Omine M. Kajii E. Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 68: 257-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymatic activities of four ABO homologues were assessed by the expression of A- or B-antigen on HeLa cells transfected by the cDNAs with or without co-transfection of FUT1 cDNA. The cDNA transfection was carried out by an electroporation procedure using GenePulser II (Bio-Rad). Twenty-four hours after transfection, HeLa cells were harvested and stained by anti-A, anti-B, or anti-H mouse monoclonal antibodies (DACO, Carpinteria, CA), and a second antibody of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgM goat serum (Cappel, Aurora, OH). The stained cells underwent flow cytometry (Cytronabsolute, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ). The human A-transferase cDNA isoform, which includes intron 6 (FY-66-1), was kindly provided by Dr. Hakomori (16Yamamoto F. McNeill P.D. Hakomori S. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). B-transferase cDNA was generated by replacement of theSacII/SalI fragment of FY-66-1 with that of B-transferase gene exon 7. The cDNA was inserted into the downstream of the chicken β-actin promoter of the pCAGGS vector and injected into Wistar rat pronuclei. The microinjected fertilized eggs were then transferred to pseudopregnant recipient rats. Transgenic founders were detected by PCR and RT-PCR of tail genomic DNA and total RNA, and stable lines were generated by breeding the founders. Wild, A-transgenic, and B-transgenic rats were sacrificed at 3 and 5 months of age. The 15 organs were removed from the animals and embedded in compound. Ten-μm thick frozen sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer and placed in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% Triton X-100). The blocked sections were or were not reacted with anti-A, anti-B, or anti-H antibody. After washing, the sections were reacted with biotin-labeled anti-mouse goat antibody followed by Texas Red-labeled avidin staining. Counterstaining was performed with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyindole (Sigma). Small intestinal specimens from wild, A-transgenic, and B-transgenic rats were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose solution and solubilized in SDS sample buffer. Ten micrograms per lane of solubilized small intestinal proteins were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in denaturing buffer. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot membrane was separated into three strips and the strips were stained individually with anti-A, anti-B, or anti-H antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM and West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). To clone the rat ABOhomologue gene, partial sequences were amplified from genome DNA, which corresponded to exon 7 of the human gene. Used primer sequences were chosen from the fragments highly conserved between human and mouse (17Yamamoto M. Lin X.H. Kominato Y. Hata Y. Noda R. Saitou N. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13701-13708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The PCR product was subcloned into a plasmid and the individual clones were sequenced. Twenty sequenced clones were divided into four groups according to the base substitutions and tentatively named pCR2.61, pCR2.66, pCR2.6B, and pCR3.47. The Southern blot membrane of the rat genome was probed by these fragments. The genome DNA digested by EcoRI showed variations in fragment number and size: four fragments in Wistar, DA/Slc, and ACI/N Slc; three fragments in LEW/Crj and BN/Crj; two fragments in PVG/Sea; and five fragments in SD rat (Fig. 1). DNA fragments that appeared inBamHI-digested genomes also showed polymorphisms among the strains: three fragments in Wistar, DA/Slc, ACI/N Slc, and SD rats; and two fragments in LEW/Crj, PVG/Sea, and BN/Crj rats. These findings indicate that the rat ABO homologue consists of multicopy genes and the copy number possibly varies among strains. The RACE procedure was used to obtain the full-length transcript sequences of the ABO homologues. Sixty-eight 5′-RACE and 48 3′-RACE clones were sequenced and realigned into four clones: rat-2.66 (GenBankTMaccession number AB081649), rat-2.61 (AB081650), rat-2.6B (AB081651), and rat-3.47 (AB081652). These sequences were verified by a standard RT-PCR procedure with their 5′ and 3′ specific primers. The open reading frames estimated were aligned with human and mouse transferases (Fig. 2 A). The catalytic domain was conservative, but the regions following to the N-terminal transmembrane domain were variable. The rat-3.47 clone lost the fragment that corresponded to exon 4 of the human ABO gene and was also lost in mouse cDNA. The overlined amino acids in Fig. 2 A show the four residues that are considered the amino residues responsible for the sugar nucleotide donor selection of human A-transferase (Arg-175, Gly-234, Leu-266, and Gly-268) and B-transferase (Gly-175, Ser-234, Met-266, and Ala-268) (18Yamamoto F. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19257-19262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among these residues, the last two have been shown to be particularly important for substrate selection. Three cDNAs, rat-2.66, rat-2.61, and rat-2.6B, encoded Ala and Gly at equivalent residues of human 266 and 268, which are similar to those of human A-transferase. The cloned rat-3.47 encoded both Met and Ala, which are identical to those of B-transferase. Based on the maximum matching analysis, a phylogenetic tree was drawn using the neighbor joining method (Fig. 2 B). The four rat cDNAs were clustered in a branch next to the mouse ABO, suggesting that they are paralogous genes. Four rat cDNAs of the ABO homologues were inserted in a eukaryotic expression vector and their enzymatic activities were assayed by introducing the constructs into HeLa cells. The transfected HeLa cells were stained by anti-A, anti-B, and anti-H antibodies and subjected to flow cytometry (Table I). Three cDNA clones, rat-2.66, rat-2.61, and rat-2.6B, expressed A-antigen on HeLa cells when they were co-transfected with FUT1 cDNA, but clone rat-3.47 did not. Reciprocally, rat-3.47 expressed B-antigen but rat-2.66, rat-2.61, and rat-2.6B clones did not. Apparent expression of A- or B-antigens was not observed on the cells transfected with only ABO homologues (pSSRα-bsr). These results indicate that rat homologues also select H-antigen as an acceptor substrate and transfer GalNAc or Gal to it, depending on the residues responsible for substrate selection.Table IFlow cytometric analysis of HeLa cells transfected with expression vectorsHeLa cells were transfected with human or rat ABO homologue cDNAs in pCR3 eukaryotic expression vector. Mock transfection was performed with a pCR3 empty vector. Co-transfection with pSSRα (empty vector) or pSSRα-FUT1 was performed in each column as indicated. Twenty-four hours after transfection, HeLa cells were harvested and stained with anti-H, anti-A, or anti-B antibody. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Percent of stained cells (positive %) and mean fluorescent intensity with standard deviation (mean ± S.D.) are listed. Shaded numbers indicate the significant positive staining. Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were transfected with human or rat ABO homologue cDNAs in pCR3 eukaryotic expression vector. Mock transfection was performed with a pCR3 empty vector. Co-transfection with pSSRα (empty vector) or pSSRα-FUT1 was performed in each column as indicated. Twenty-four hours after transfection, HeLa cells were harvested and stained with anti-H, anti-A, or anti-B antibody. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Percent of stained cells (positive %) and mean fluorescent intensity with standard deviation (mean ± S.D.) are listed. Shaded numbers indicate the significant positive staining. To discriminate the expression of the four rat ABO homologues, multiplex RT-PCR was used for the templates originating from the 15 organs. Simultaneous amplification in a tube and gel electrophoresis showed exclusive and relatively high level expression of rat-2.66 transcript in salivary glands, small intestine, and urinary bladder, and weak expression in the stomach and colon (Fig. 3). Weak bands from rat-2.61 and rat-2.6B appeared in the large intestine. Transcripts of rat-3.47 were ubiquitous. Human A-transferase or B-transferase cDNA in pCAGGS vector was introduced in rat fertilized eggs by microinjection, and the founders were screened by PCR of tail DNA and RNA. Fifty-six rats were born from 346 eggs of the injected A-transferase gene. Genome integration was observed in 10 founders of the 56 rats. Six of the 10 rats were also RT-PCR positive. Two B-transferase transgenic (B-Tg) founders were identified in the same way as A-Tg rats. A- or B-antigen expression was assayed by an immunohistochemical technique. RT-PCR positive rats expressed A- or B-antigen on the epidermal cell surface, hair follicle epithelium, and sweat glands but not on red blood cells, vascular endothelium, connecting tissue, or bone (Fig.4 A). Two founders of each transgenic rat were mated and homozygous transgenic rats were established. After 1 year of observation, no macroscopic and microscopic phenotype alterations were observed in the founder or F1 and F2 transgenic rats. Although the differences in the embryo have not been analyzed, these findings suggest that enhanced expression of A-transferase or B-transferase activity has no effect on rat growth and development. To access the basal expression of A- and B-antigens in wild rats and determine the influence of overexpression of human A-transferase or B-transferase, systemic organs were stained by an immunohistochemical procedure. The staining profiles by anti-A or anti-B antibodies are listed in Fig. 4 C and representative results are shown in Fig. 4 B. Wild rats expressed A-antigens obviously on the acinus of salivary glands, mucosal crypts, intestinal mucus, and epithelium of the urinary bladder and weakly on stomach epithelium, which corresponded to the results of rat-2.66, rat-2.61, and rat-2.6B mRNA distribution. Enhanced expression of human A-transferase under the actin promoter resulted in the ectopic expression of A-antigen in the brain plexus, type II lung epithelium, the exocrine gland of the pancreas, and the epidermis, and enhanced expression in the epithelium of the stomach. Apparent staining by anti-B antibody was not observed in any wild and A-Tg rat organs studied, whereas weak expression of 3.47 mRNA was ubiquitous. Only B-Tg rats expressed B-antigen on the same organs as A-Tg rats, despite the fact that the staining was relatively weak compared with that in the A-Tg rats. The salivary glands, stomach, intestines, and bladder of B-Tg rats were still positive for anti-A antibody. To evaluate quantitatively the expression of ABH antigens in the intestine, the membranes blotted with small intestinal proteins of the three rats were stained by anti-A, anti-B, or anti-H antibody. It appeared that the bands with molecular weights around 216,000 and 78,000 were the nonspecific immune complexes or intrinsic peroxidase activity. Monoclonal antibody against A-antigen showed equivalent smear bands in all three rats. Antibody against B-antigen stained only B-Tg rat intestinal proteins. Anti-H antibody stained all rats weakly, but the smear band in wild rat was most prominent, which might be the result of masking of residual H-antigen by the overexpression of human A-transferase or human B-transferase (Fig. 5). We cloned four paralogous gene family members equivalent to theABO glycosyltransferase gene from a Wistar rat. Three of the genes expressed A-antigen and one expressed B-antigen on HeLa cells with the help of FUT1. The amino acid residues responsible for the selection of the nucleotide sugar donor in humans (L266M and G268A) were Ala and Gly in rat-2.66, rat-2.61, and rat-2.6B clones and resembled human A-transferase, and Met and Ala in rat-3.47 clones were identical to human B-transferase. These results showed that the corresponding residues of human 266 and 268 in rat clones are involved in the nucleotide sugar donor selection, UDP-GalNAc or UDP-Gal. B-antigen was undetectable in any organs studied from wild Wistar rats, whereas rat-3.47 mRNA for B-transferase activity was expressed ubiquitously in rat organs. Enforced expression of human B-transferase, however, resulted in the expression of B-antigen, although the level was much less than that of A-antigen. Therefore, the low transcript level of rat B-transferase may be the main reason for the deletion of B-antigen in wild Wistar rats. Another possible reason is competition for the substrate of UDP-galactose with α1,3-galactosyltransferase, which was discussed in a mouse homologue with cis-AB activity (17Yamamoto M. Lin X.H. Kominato Y. Hata Y. Noda R. Saitou N. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13701-13708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Bouhours et al. (9Bouhours D. Hansson G.C. Bouhours J.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) reported that rat large intestinal glycosphingolipids showed genetic polymorphisms, in which some rat strains lacked A-antigen, whereas all strains expressed B-antigen active glycosphingolipid. By breeding and back-crossing of the strains, those investigators also revealed that the polymorphism was not the result of allelic genes but was controlled by closely linked multigenes. During the preparation of this paper, Olson et al. (19Olson F.J. Johansson M.E.V. Klinga-Levan K. Bouhours D. Enerbäck L. Hansson G.C. Karlsson N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15044-15052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported on two rat A-transferases they cloned as a pair of alleles (AF469945 and AF469946). The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of AF469946 are identical to those of rat-2.61, and AF469945is 95% homologous to rat-2.66 and rat-2.61 clones. However, our four cDNA clones were identified from one animal and each mRNA expression pattern is distinctive from the others. Furthermore, multiple bands in a Southern blotting study supported a conclusion that four Wistar rat genes equivalent to the human histo-blood groupABO gene are not the allelic genes but members of the paralogous gene family. The predicted amino acid sequences of rat-2.66, rat-2.61, rat-2.6B, and rat-3.47 showed 97 to 83% homology among them. The neighbor joining method revealed that the rat orthologue members form one cluster, indicating they evolved from an ancestral gene. However, multiple alignment of the four predicted peptides showed sharing of amino acid residues among them, i.e. between rat-2.66 and rat-2.61 and between rat-2.66 and rat-2.6B. This indicated that the amino acid differences among the genes did not simply result from base substitutions but recombination by repeated gene shuffling among them. It has been postulated that tandem copy paralogous genes evolve through interlocus nucleotide shuffling. For example, RHD andRHCE genes, encoding the rhesus blood group system, donate or accept gene fragments from each other and develop highly polymorphic antigen systems (20Wagner F.F. Flegel W.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 3662-3668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Okuda H. Suganuma H. Kamesaki T. Kumada M. Tsudo N. Omi T. Iwamoto S. Kajii E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 670-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Rat ABO homologues might have evolved in this manner, and some strains lack A-transferase activity in the large intestine. The multicopy status of the ABO homologue appears not to be restricted to rats. Multiple fragments in the Southern blotting study probed by the human A-transferase gene were found in dogs, cats, and rabbits in addition to rats (22Kominato Y. McNeill P.D. Yamamoto M. Russell M. Hakomori S. Yamamoto F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 154-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Expression of both A- and B-antigens in the intestinal mucosa of rabbits has also been reported (23Breimer M.E. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.A. Leffler H. Pimlott W. Samuelsson B.E. Biomed. Mass Spectrom. 1979; 6: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Saitou and Yamamoto (24Saitou N. Yamamoto F. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1997; 14: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) argued that the seven nucleotide polymorphisms between A and B alleles in human are more excessive than expected as simple base substitutions and that positive selection pressure affected the evolution of higher primate ABO genes. However, if the mammalian ABO ancestral genes consisted of multicopy genes with A- and B-transferase activity like rats, they must donate or accept gene fragments from each other and may produce a locus composed of A and B alleles. The multicopy genes may possibly gather and bundle into a single gene through unequal crossover. Southern blotting studies in seven rat strains suggest deletion or acquisition of some loci. This estimation must be resolved by further genome projects in rats and other mammals. A-Tg rats expressed A-antigen in the brain plexus, lung type II epithelium, pancreas acinus, and skin in addition to digestive mucosa, salivary gland, and bladder, in which A-antigen was expressed in wild rats also. B-antigen in B-Tg rats was detected in the same tissue as A-antigen in A-Tg rats. These results indicate that the organs that ectopically expressed A-antigen provided the substrates for the transferase, H-antigen, but lacked the endogenous ABO homologues and resulted in negative staining against anti-A antibody. H-antigen in rodents is restricted to epithelial organs, whereas they also have two α1,2-fucosyltransferase genes like human (25Piau J.P. Labarriere N. Dabouis G. Denis M.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 623-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Sherwood A.L. Holmes E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 355: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The rodent orthologue of human FUT1 lacks the promoter that transactivates the gene in the erythroid of hominoids, so that rodents do not express H-antigen in the organs of mesothelial origin (27Koda Y. Soejima M. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7501-7505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Soejima M. Koda Y. Wang B. Kimura H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Ubiquitous and overexpression analysis of A-transferase and B-transferase clearly showed the absence of H-antigen in the endothelium but its presence in epidermis, brain plexus, lung, and pancreas. Further transgenesis of the human FUT1 gene will mimic ABH expression in human organs and will be useful for the simulation of the ABO- mismatched vascular graft. Holmes et al. (12Holmes E.H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7698-7703Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that precancerous liver and hepatoma in Fischer 344 rats induced by the chemical carcinogenN-2-acetylaminofluorene expressed B-antigen as the α-galactosyl-α-fucosyl-GM1 form. Precancerous liver and hepatome were induced to express α-fucosyltransferase (29Holmes E.H. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3706-3713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesized α-fucosyl-GM1 was the substrate for normally expressing α-galactosyltransferase and was converted into B-determinants. The ABO homologue that liver is expressing is the rat-3.47 gene with B-transferase activity. Then, the normally existing α-galactosyltransferase is estimated to have been the product of the rat-3.47 gene. In human colorectal, lung, and bladder cancer, the deletion of A- or B-antigen in cancer cells associate with poor prognosis of the cancer patients (7Hakomori S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1989; 52: 257-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). In 25% of primary bladder tumors, loss of heterozygosity of the ABH locus was observed (30Miyao N. Tsai Y.C. Lerner S.P. Olumi A.F. Spruck 3rd, C.H. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Nichols P.W. Skinner D.G. Jones P.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4066-4070PubMed Google Scholar). Rat chemical-induced colorectal cancer also changed the ABH antigen expression (13Hallouin F. Goupille C. le Cabellec M. Bara J. le Pendu J. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The ABH gene expression was down-regulated in A-negative human colorectal cancer cells by the methylation of the promoter and the reduced activity of the enhancer element of the gene (31Kominato Y. Hata Y. Takizawa H. Tsuchiya T. Tsukada J. Yamamoto F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37240-37250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 32Iwamoto S. Withers D.A. Handa K. Hakomori S. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The presented cDNA data should contribute for investigation in alteration of the rat ABO homologue expression in the chemical oncogenesis. Furthermore, the established Tg rats express A- or B-transferase independently from the native genes and will be useful to reveal whether the ABH antigen affect directly the cancer virulence. ABH antigen expression in human and rat fetuses is under strict control by stage of development and it is organ-specific (6Szulman A.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1980; 14: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33Mak K.M. Lieber C.S. Anat. Rec. 2000; 259: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), whereas its exact meaning for fetal development is still under investigation. ABH antigen was found in early embryos (week 5) in the cardiovascular endothelium, the epithelial cells of all organ rudiments, and the erythropoietic cells in blood islands (6Szulman A.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1980; 14: 127-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After recession of the epithelial cell wall antigens at the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, ABH antigen expression increases as the respective organs mature, e.g. mucous secretion in digestive organs. A-antigen and B-antigen expression in transgenic rats should be controlled byFUT1 or FUT2 gene expression, which might permit the usual embryogenesis of the transgenic rats. Immunohistochemical follow-up of A-antigen expression in wild and transgenic rat fetuses may provide further information on the function of the ABH antigen in embryogenesis. We are grateful to T. Oyamada and T. Hatano for valuable technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2148281839,"The function of synapsin I is regulated by phosphorylation of the molecule at multiple sites; among them, the Ser603 residue (site 3) is considered to be a pivotal site targeted by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII). Although phosphorylation of the Ser603 residue responds to several kinds of stimuli, it is unlikely that many or all of the stimuli activate the CaMKII-involved pathway. Among the several stimulants tested in PC12 cells, bradykinin evoked the phosphorylation of Ser603 without inducing the autophosphorylation of CaMKII, which was determined using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies against phospho-Ser603-synapsin I (pS603-Syn I-Ab) and phospho-Thr286/287-CaMKII. The bradykinin-evoked phosphorylation of Ser603 was not suppressed by the CaMKII inhibitor KN62, whereas high KCl-evoked phosphorylation was accompanied by CaMKII autophosphorylation and inhibited by KN62. Thus, we attempted to identify Ser603 kinase(s) besides CaMKII. We consequently detected four and three fractions with Ca2+/calmodulin-independent Ser603 kinase activity on the DEAE column chromatography of bovine brain homogenate and PC12 cell lysate, respectively, two of which were purified and identified by amino acid sequence of proteolytic fragments as p21-activated kinase (PAK) 1 and PAK3. The immunoprecipitants from bovine brain homogenate with anti-PAK1 and PAK3 antibodies incorporated32P into synapsin I in a Cdc42/GTPγS-dependent manner, and its phosphorylation site was confirmed as Ser603 using pS603-Syn I-Ab. Additionally, recombinant GST-PAK2 could phosphorylate the Ser603 residue in the presence of Cdc42/GTPγS. Finally, we confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis that the transfection of constitutively active rat αPAK (PAK1) in PC12 cells evokes the phosphorylation of Ser603 even in the resting mutant cells and enhances it in the bradykinin-stimulated cells, whereas that of dominant-negative αPAK quenches the phosphorylation. These results raise the possibility that Ser603 on synapsin I is alternatively phosphorylated by PAKs, not only by CaMKII, in neuronal cells in response to some stimulants.

Synapsin is a phosphoprotein found exclusively in neuronal presynaptic terminals and characterized as an anchoring protein between the vesicle phospholipid layer and the neuronal cytoskeleton. The cross-linking activity is regulated in a phosphorylation state-dependent manner, thereby controlling vesicle movement to active zones (1Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T.

Synapse. 1992; 10: 62-70Google Scholar), which is recognized as the site specific for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and as one of the most effective sites for neurotransmitter release (1Hilfiker S.

Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 459-464Google Scholar). However, it is unknown whether these stimuli directly or indirectly activate CaMKII through the adenylate cyclase/protein kinase A (PKA)-pathway or PKC-pathway(s). On the other hand, Hosakaet al. (8Hosaka M. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 1999; 24: 377-387Google Scholar) proposed that neurotransmitter release may require phosphorylation of site 1 (Ser9) in the N terminus of synapsins but not of Ser603, the former being recognized as a PKA and CaMKI site, the latter as a CaMKII site (1Hilfiker S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31235-31240Google Scholar). Recently, Jovanovic et al. (10Jovanovic J.N. Czernik A.J. Fienberg A.A. Greengard P. Sihra T.S. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 323-329Google Scholar) reported that brain-derived neurotrophic factor induced the release of neurotransmitter from rat synaptosomes coincidentally with the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and concomitantly with the phosphorylation of site 4/5 and site 6, but not with autophosphorylation of CaMKII. In contrast, Liu et al. (11Liu J. Fukunaga K. Yamamoto H. Nishi K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8292-8299Google Scholar) reported that brain-derived neurotrophic factor can promote the induction of long term potentiation and concomitant activation of CaMKII but not of mitogen-activated protein kinase in rat hippocampal slices, which probably occurred at a postsynaptic site. Furthermore, Matsubara et al. (12Matsubara M. Kusubata M. Ishiguro K. Uchida T. Titani K. Taniguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 35: 21108-21113Google Scholar) reported that cyclin-dependent kinases phosphorylate the site 4 (Ser551) and/or site 2 (Ser553) on synapsin Iin vitro and that this phosphorylation affects the affinity of synapsin I to F-actin. Although the phosphorylation site essential for the release of neurotransmitters is still controversial, the Ser603 residue must be one of the pivotal sites for the release (1Hilfiker S. Pieribone V.A. Czernik A.J. Kao H.T. Augustine G.J. Greengard P. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1999; 354: 269-279Google Scholar, 2Turner K.M. Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 459-464Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that many, or all of the stimuli that induce the phosphorylation of Ser603 activate the CaMKII pathway. Rather, it is plausible that many stimuli activate several protein kinases to phosphorylate the Ser603residue. Thus, to investigate the existence of a novel (or another) protein kinase that phosphorylates Ser603 on synapsin I in neuronal cells, we tested several agonists that induce the phosphorylation of Ser603 but not the autophosphorylation of CaMKII. Preinflammatory factors are reported to induce or enhance the release of neurotransmitters through the activation of cell surface receptors (13Appell K.C. Barefoot D.S. Biochem.

Among these agonists, bradykinin (BK) is recognized as a potent agonist of the release of catecholamine from PC12 cells in an intracellular Ca2+-dependent manner (13Appell K.C. Barefoot D.S. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 11-18Google Scholar, 16Gasman S. Chasserot-Golaz S. Popoff M.R. Aunis D. Bader M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20564-20571Google Scholar). In some of these, BK stimulation seems to be involved in small G protein-dependent pathway(s) in PC12 cells (17Nakamura K. Katoh H. Ichikawa A. Negishi M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 646-652Google Scholar). Recently, it has been accepted that BK stimulates a small G protein Cdc42/p21-activated kinase (PAK)-involved pathway in several cell systems (18Meriane M. Mary S. Comunale F. Vignal E. Fort P. Gauthier-Rouvière C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33046-33052Google Scholar, 19Lim L. Manser E. Leung T. Hall C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 242: 171-185Google Scholar, 20Wilk-Blaszczak M.A. Singer W.D.

In this study, we found that BK evokes the phosphorylation of synapsin I at Ser603 but not the autophosphorylation of CaMKII in PC12 cells and that bovine brain homogenate and PC12 cell lysate contain fractions that have Ca2+/calmodulin-independent Ser603 kinase activities. Synapsin I was purified from bovine brain as described by Schiebler et al. (22Bähler M. Greengard P. Nature. 1987; 326: 704-707Google Scholar). GST-Cdc42 was prepared according to the method of Chuang et al. (23Chuang T.H. Xu X. Quilliam L.A. Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 761-767Google Scholar). His-tagged PAK2 was prepared by GeneStorm Expression-Ready clone of human PAK2 (Invitrogen). In brief, COS7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/PAK2 using FuGENE 6. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested and lysed. His-tagged PAK2 was purified through a Ni column (Qiagen) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Chromatography columns, SP-, DEAE-, phenyl- and heparin-Toyopearl, and HA1000 (hydroxyapatite column), and MonoQ were purchased from Tosoh (Tokuyama, Japan). Anti-PAK1, anti-PAK3, and anti-Rho-kinase antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-synapsin I antibody was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). KN62 was from Seikagaku Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Other materials and chemicals were purchased from commercial sources. Monoclonal antibody against Ser603 (site 3)-phosphorylated synapsin I was raised in mice immunized with keyhole limpet hemocyanine (klh)-conjugated phosphopeptide GPIRQApSQAGPGPC-klh, as previously described (24Sakurada K. Seto M. Sasaki Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1563-C1572Google Scholar). In brief, Ribi adjuvant emulsion containing 25 μg of the phosphopeptide preparation was injected into BALB/c mice. Three days after the final booster, the spleen was removed and the spleen cells were fused with mouse P3Ui myeloma cells. After screening for useful hybridomas by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the antibody (pS603-Syn I-Ab) obtained was subjected to immunoblot analysis with synapsin I phosphorylated by CaMKII and with the extract of PC12 cells stimulated by 50 mm KCl (Fig. 1,A and B). The immunoactive band was completely quenched with 10 μg/ml Ser603-phosphorylated peptide (Fig. 1 A), and the cell extract showed almost a single immunoactive band (Fig. 1 B). Polyclonal antibodies (pS566-Syn I-Ab and pS603-Syn I-Ab) against synapsin I phosphorylated either at site 2 or site 3 were raised in rabbits immunized with klh-conjugated phosphopeptides ATRQApSISGPAPC-klh (site 2) and GPIRQApSQAGPGPC-klh (site 3) and characterized as described previously (25Tabuchi H. Yamamoto H. Matsumoto K. Ebihara K. Takeuchi Y. Fukunaga K. Hiraoka H. Sasaki Y. Shichiri M. Miyamoto E. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2350-2360Google Scholar). Other polyclonal antibodies were also raised in rabbits using phosphopeptides YLRRRLpSDSNFMAC-khl (site 1) for pS9-Syn I-Ab, ASPAAPpSPGSSGGC-klh (site 5) for pS67-Syn I-Ab and CAARPPApSPSPQRQC-klh (site 6) for pS551-Syn I-Ab and characterized as described above. The polyclonal antibody against Thr286/287-phosphorylated CaMKII was prepared and characterized as described previously (26Yokota S. Yamamoto M. Moriya T. Akiyama M. Fukunaga K. Miyamoto E. Shibata S. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 618-627Google Scholar). PC12 cells were plated and grown at a density of 9 × 105 cells/60 mm dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum at 37 °C for 2 days. After a 12-h serum starvation, the cells were used in the experiments. We made use of a HA-tagged rat αPAK-encoded plasmid pXJ40HA from Dr. Manser, in which Lys298 is mutated to Ala in order to make a dominant-negative form and Thr422 is replaced with Glu to produce a constitutively active form (27Manser E. Huang H.-Y. Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Google Scholar). The transfection of both was conducted according to the method of Bokoch (28Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 cells (1 × 105) were plated on polyimine-coated cover glass in 35-mm diameter dishes 24 h before transfection, washed with PBS, and then treated in 0.6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 μl of Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and 5 μg of the plasmid for 2 h at 37 °C. The resulting cells were washed with PBS and then further incubated in regular growth medium for 24 h at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum for serum starvation overnight. The cells were subjected to the stimulation with BK or KCl and processed for immunocytochemistry. PC12 cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 4% sucrose and 4 mm EGTA for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed three times with PBS and then permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. After a wash with PBS, the cells were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and washed once with PBS. The cells were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 1:2000 dilution of polyclonal pS603-Syn I-Ab in PBS containing 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. They were washed three times with PBS for 5 min and then incubated with 7.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) and 0.75 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h. PC12 cells were washed with HEPES-buffered saline (HBS) which contained 150 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 20 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. After preincubation with or without KN62, the cells were stimulated by 1 μm BK or 50 mm KCl at 37 °C for a specified period. The reaction was terminated by adding 5% trichloracetic acid, and the cells were then scraped and sedimented. The trichloroacetic acid cell pellet was dissolved in 200 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 8 m urea and a protease inhibitor mixture and then neutralized. 10 μl of the sample was subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) on a 5–20% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA.). After blocking with skimmed milk, the membrane was treated with the primary antibody (polyclonal (1:500) or monoclonal (1:100) pS603-Syn I-Ab) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ig antibody (Amersham Biosciences) using an ECL system (AmershamBisocsciences). CaMKII was prepared as previously described (29Fukunaga K. Yamamoto H. Matsui K. Higashi K. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1982; 39: 1607-1617Google Scholar), and the enzyme reaction was started by adding CaMKII to a 100-μl reaction mixture containing 20 μg of synapsin I, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 3 μmcalmodulin, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP or cold ATP for 10–30 min at 30 °C. The resulting mixture was subjected to autoradiography or immunoblotting analysis using pS603-Syn I-Ab. Phosphorylated synapsin I was used as the standard. The assays for other protein kinases, PKA, Rho-kinase, and PAKs were performed as described previously (30Nagumo H. Sasaki Y. Ono Y. Okamoto H. Seto M. Takuwa Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C57-C65Google Scholar). Ser603 (site 3) kinase activity was determined by ELISA using pS603-Syn I-Ab and synapsin I. Each fraction (10 μl) obtained by column chromatography was added to the well of a synapsin I (1 μg/well)-adsorbed 96-well immunoplate containing 100 μl of reaction mixture (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of 20% H3PO4, followed by washing with washing buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS). Phosphorylation of synapsin I was determined using monoclonal pS603-Syn I-Ab (1:100) followed by anti-mouse Ig antibody conjugated with HRP (1:1000). To prepare the immunoprecipitants of PAK1 and PAK3 from a bovine brain homogenate and PC12 cell lysate, anti-PAK1 and anti-PAK3 antibodies were prebound to protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by incubation for 1 h at room temperature and then washed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, 1 mmNa3VO4, 0.1 mmNa2MoO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 300 μl of bovine brain homogenate (∼30 μg of protein) or PC12 cell lysate (2 × 106 cells) was incubated with 20 μl of a 1:1 slurry of anti-PAK antibody-beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer and twice with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1 mm DTT. The bead pellet was used to assay the synapsin I phosphorylation activity. The protein kinase activity for each phosphorylation site of synapsin I was assessed by immunoblot analysis using pS9-Syn I-Ab, pS67-Syn I-Ab, pS551-Syn I-Ab, pS553-Syn I-Ab, and pS603-Syn I-Ab. Bovine brain gray matter (300 g) was homogenized in 1000 ml of homogenizing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The 100,000 × gsupernatant of the homogenate was applied to a SP-Toyopearl column (50 ml) equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT) and the flow-through fraction was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl column (250 ml). After a wash with buffer A, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient to 0.3 m NaCl in buffer A. Ser603 kinase activity was detected as four major peaks in the chromatogram. Peak I eluted with 90 mmNaCl, peak II with 120 mm NaCl, peak III with 175 mm NaCl, and peak IV with 200 mm NaCl. Each combined fraction of peaks II and III were made in 1 mammonium sulfate and then applied to a phenyl-Toyopearl column (50 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 1 m ammonium sulfate. The kinase activity was eluted with a linear gradient to 10% of dioxan in buffer A and dialyzed against buffer A. The dialysate of combined fractions containing protein kinase activity, which originated from peak II obtained by DEAE column chromatography, was further applied to a heparin-Toyopearl column (10 ml) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient to 0.7 m NaCl in buffer A. The resulting fractions were applied to a hydroxyapatite column (HA1000) (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer B (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0). Kinase activity was eluted with a linear gradient to 0.4 m potassium phosphate. An aliquot of each kinase-containing fraction was resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 5–20% (w/v) acrylamide gel, and proteins were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For the purification of peak III on DEAE-column chromatography, the fractions containing Ser603 kinase activity were subjected to phenyl-column chromatography. The protein kinase-containing fractions were dialyzed and further applied to a Source 15 Q (Amersham Biosciences) column (8 ml) equilibrated with buffer A and eluted with a linear gradient to 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. The fractions containing protein kinase activity were subjected to heparin-Toyopearl column chromatography (10 ml) followed by hydroxyapatite column chromatography (HA1000) (1 ml) as for peak II. Internal peptide microsequencing of p68 and p65 was carried out by the method of Hellman et al. (31Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Góñez J. Heldin C.-H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Google Scholar). The purified p68 and p65 were subjected to SDS-PAGE in 5–20% (w/v) acrylamide and the protein bands were cut out. The tryptic fragments were purified employing the SMART system using a reversed-phase column (μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10) (AmershamBiosciences), and the sequence was determined with a PPSQ-23 system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Of the several agonists tested, five evoked the phosphorylation of synapsin I at the Ser603 residue as determined with pS603-Syn 1-Ab (Fig. 1 C). The Ser603 residue was phosphorylated rapidly (within 30 s) in response to KCl, nicotine, glutamate, and BK, whereas nerve growth factor-evoked phosphorylation required a longer treatment (over 1 h). Bradykinin-evoked phosphorylation of Ser603 was accompanied by little or no autophosphorylation of CaMKII. Because the phosphorylation of Ser603 is generally considered to be CaMKII-dependent, we further investigated the BK-evoked phosphorylation at Ser603 in PC12 cells (Fig. 2). Both high KCl (60 mm) and 1 μm BK evoked a transient phosphorylation, and the extent of the KCl-evoked phosphorylation was 2- to 2.5-fold higher. The KCl-evoked, but not BK-evoked phosphorylation, was suppressed by 3 μm KN62, a CaMKII inhibitor, whose IC50 was around 1.5 μm (Fig.3). These findings led us to speculate that there is another pathway that might be activated by BK for the phosphorylation of Ser603 in PC12 cells besides the CaMKII-involved one.Figure 3Inhibition by KN62 of Ser603phosphorylation in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were preincubated with 1–10 μm KN62 for 15 min and then stimulated with 50 mm KCl (A) or 1 μm BK (B) for 30 s. Data are expressed as a percentage of the control without inhibitor. Each point and bar represents the mean ± S.D. of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We tried to detect and isolate the Ser603 kinase activity under Ca2+-free conditions in 100,000 × gsupernatant fractions of a bovine brain homogenate by sequential column chromatography using an ELISA system consisting of a pS603-Syn I-Ab and synapsin I-adsorbed 96-well plate (Fig.4). The first DEAE-Toyopearl column chromatography yielded four major peaks of Ser603 kinase activity; eluted with 0.09 m NaCl (peak I), 0.12m NaCl (peak II), 0.175 m NaCl (peak III), and 0.2 m NaCl (peak IV), respectively (Fig. 4 A). The peak I fractions reacted with anti-Rho-kinase antibody (data not shown). CaMKII was detected with anti-CaMKII antibody in fractions 10–22 (data not shown). Peak II and peak III fractions were further purified through a phenyl-Toyopearl column, a Source15Q column only for peak III, a heparin-Toyopearl column, and finally a hydroxyapatite column as described under “Materials and Methods.” The elution pattern of peak II and III fractions from the hydroxyapatite column is shown in Fig. 4 (B and C) and the SDS-PAGE staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 is shown in Fig. 4(D and E). The final eluates consisted of proteins of molecular mass 68,000 Da (for peak II) and 65,000 Da (for peak III), termed p68 and p65, respectively. The p68 and p65 obtained by SDS-PAGE were subjected to peptide microsequencing. The trypsin-digested peptide of p68 was sequenced as six internal peptides as follows: EKERPEISLPSDFEHTIHVGFDA, SVYTR, DIKSDNILLGMDG, LTDFGFCAQITPEQSKR, TMVGTPYWMAPEVVTR, and ELLQHQFLK; and that of p65 as four internal peptides: ERPEISLP, LLQTSNITKLEQK, YMSFTSGDKSAHGYIAA, and STMVGTPYWMAPEVV. The amino acid sequences of p68 peptides fully matched the p21-activated protein kinase isoform PAK1 as compared with the Swiss-Prot protein sequence data base entries, and the sequences of p65 matched PAK3 (Fig. 5).Figure 5Internal peptide microsequencing of p68 and p65. The amino acid sequence of six tryptic peptides from p68 and four from p65 was determined. The amino acid sequences are shown with the single-letter abbreviations. Identified amino acids areboxed. These sequences were compared with those of the bovine p21-activated protein kinase isoforms PAK1 and PAK3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As p68 and p65 were identified in the amino acid sequence of PAK1 and PAK3, respectively, we examined whether the immunoprecipitants from a bovine brain homogenate obtained using anti-PAK1 and PAK3 antibodies could phosphorylate synapsin I at the Ser603 residue. The immunoprecipitants of PAK1 and PAK3 incorporated 32P into synapsin I (both subtypes a and b) in a GST-Cdc42/GTPγS-dependent manner, and the extent of GST-Cdc42/GTPγS activation was 10–30 times higher (Fig.6 A). The phosphorylation site was identified as Ser603 using the pS603-Syn 1-Ab. Moreover, we tested the phosphorylation of other sites on synapsin I with the immunoprecipitants using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies (Fig. 6 B). The synapsin I preparation, which was treated with the immunoprecipitants of PAK1 and PAK3, reacted with pS9-Syn I-Ab to a similar extent to pS603-Syn I-Ab, whereas the intensity of the immunoreaction with pS551-Syn I-Ab was lower. Immunoreactivity for Ser67 and Ser553 was scarcely detected. To avoid phosphorylation by contaminants in these immunoprecipitants and also to check the activity of other PAK subtypes, we examined whether His-tagged recombinant PAK2 can phosphorylate synapsin I at Ser603. The preparation of recombinant PAK2 required GST-Cdc42/GTPγS to phosphorylate the Ser603 residue (Fig. 6 C). Recombinant PAK2 could also phosphorylate the Ser9 and Ser551 residues in a GST-Cdc42/GTPrS-dependent manner (Fig.6 D). Like the case of the bovine brain homogenate, we detected Ca2+-independent Ser603 kinase activity in a PC12 cells lysate by MonoQ column chromatography (Fig.7 A). Three major peaks of activity were obtained; the first peak was eluted with 0.25m NaCl (fractions 16–20), whereas the second and third peaks were eluted with 0.35 and 0.45 m NaCl, respectively. CaMKII was detected in fractions 12–18 using anti-CaMKII antibody (data not shown). The immunoprecipitants of PAK1 and PAK3 from the PC12 cell lysate also phosphorylated the Ser603 residue in a Cdc42/GTPγS-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B). Finally, to confirm the phosphorylation of synapsin I at Ser603 by PAK in neuronal cells, we used PC12 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding a constitutively active and dominant-negative HA-tagged rat αPAK (identical to PAK1). In PC12 cells transfection efficiency was low, so we thus investigated the phosphorylation in an immunocytochemical analysis with pS603-Syn I-Ab. The culture, which contained wild-type and mutant cells, has the advantage of detecting the phosphorylation in both cells in the same time and the field of microscope. The expression of constitutively active αPAK evoked an immunostaining signal for synapsin I phosphorylation even in resting HA-positive cells and enhanced the immunostaining signal upon stimulation with BK and KCl (Fig.8). The BK-evoked immunostaining signal was observed in a diffusing pattern in wild-type PC12 cells. In contrast, the"
https://openalex.org/W2033915593,"The cAMP responsiveness of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene promoter is mediated by a cAMP response unit, which includes three CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPs) sites, and a cAMP response element (CRE). Because both the CRE-binding protein and several C/EBP isoforms can to bind to the CRE with similar affinity, a variety of transcription factor bindings arrays in the cAMP response unit are possible that may affect the protein kinase A (PKA) responsivity of the promoter. To explore this issue, we have designed PEPCK promoter variants that have the native cis-elements within the cAMP response unit replaced with one or more LexA- and/or GAL4-binding sites. We also engineered the corresponding C/EBP and CRE-binding protein chimeras, which have their basic region leucine zipper domains replaced with LexA or GAL4 DNA-binding domains. Using this approach, we have reconstituted the PKA responsiveness of permissive PEPCK promoters in hepatoma cells and have characterized the PKA responsivity of the promoter under defined transcription factor occupancy patterns. Furthermore, analysis of deletion mutants of C/EBPalpha indicated that the domains that mediate its constitutive and PKA-inducible activities vary depending on which cis-element it occupies on the PEPCK promoter. These results suggest that promoter context may influence which domains within a transcription factor are employed to mediate transactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2156513099,"Insertions and deletions of nucleotides in the genes encoding the variable domains of antibodies are natural components of the hypermutation process, which may expand the available repertoire of hypervariable loop lengths and conformations. Although insertion of amino acids has also been utilized in antibody engineering, little is known about the functional consequences of such modifications. To investigate this further, we have introduced single-codon insertions and deletions as well as more complex modifications in the complementarity-determining regions of human antibody fragments with different specificities. Our results demonstrate that single amino acid insertions and deletions are generally well tolerated and permit production of stably folded proteins, often with retained antigen recognition, despite the fact that the thus modified loops carry amino acids that are disallowed at key residue positions in canonical loops of the corresponding length or are of a length not associated with a known canonical structure. We have thus shown that single-codon insertions and deletions can efficiently be utilized to expand structure and sequence space of the antigen-binding site beyond what is encoded by the germline gene repertoire.

Antibodies are highly specific receptors of the immune system that also have a great potential as reagents in biological chemistry and as therapeutic agents. The part of the antibody that makes contact with the antigen is comprised of two variable (V) 1The abbreviations used are: V, variable; L, light; H, heavy; CDR, complementarity-determining region; scFv, single chain variable region fragment; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; BSA, bovine serum albumin; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. domains, the heavy (H) and the light (L), which both are made up of a two-β-sheet framework. From this framework, six complementarity-determining region (CDR) loops, three from the light domain and three from the heavy domain, protrude and make up the antigen-binding site (1Amzel L.M. Poljak R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 961-997Google Scholar, 2Padlan E.A. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 169-217Google Scholar). Five of these CDR loops generally adopt only a limited number of backbone conformations, so-called canonical structures (reviewed in Ref. 3Al-Lazikani B. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 927-948Google Scholar), which are determined by the lengths of the loops and by the presence of specific key residues. The antigen specificity of the binding site is mainly determined by the sequence and conformation of these CDR loops. Antibody diversity is generated by the imprecise recombination of two or three sets of germline gene segments and by the combination of different heavy and light domains (4Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Google Scholar). The diversity is further increased by the process of somatic hypermutation (5Berek C. Milstein C. Immunol. Rev. 1987; 96: 23-41Google Scholar) and by receptor editing and revision (6Nemazee D. Weigert M. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1813-1817Google Scholar). As the germline variable gene repertoire encodes a rather limited number of CDR loop lengths (IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics data base, Ref. 7Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 207-209Google Scholar), the number of observed canonical structures is similarly limited. However, it was recently discovered that B cells evolve the genes encoding immunoglobulin V domains not only by nucleotide substitution but also through an additional mechanism of insertion and deletion of nucleotides during the hypermutation process (8de Wildt R.M. van Venrooij W.J. Winter G. Hoet R.M. Tomlinson I.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 701-710Google Scholar, 9Goossens T. Klein U. Küppers R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2463-2468Google Scholar, 10Ohlin M.

This mechanism has the potential to expand the available repertoire of loop lengths and conformations if the insertions and deletions involve entire codons and occur at positions in the sequence that can tolerate such modifications. A number of examples of seemingly functional insertions and deletions in the CDR of both the heavy and light domains of human antibodies have in fact been encountered lately (Refs. 8de Wildt R.M. van Venrooij W.J.

Furthermore, we have recently discovered that human IGHV 2The immunoglobulin gene names used in this report are according to the official IMGT/HUGO nomenclature (IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database, Ref. 7Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 207-209Google Scholar). germline genes carry features in CDR1 and CDR2 that make these regions particularly prone to deletions of entire codons (12Lantto J. Ohlin M. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 346-353Google Scholar). The occurrence of insertions and deletions in antibody V genes is not only of fundamental interest but is also of biotechnological importance. It has been known for some time that the topography of the antigen-binding site is related to the size of the antigen (13Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 113-118Google Scholar, 14Webster D.M. Henry A.H. Rees A.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 123-129Google Scholar, 15MacCallum R.M. Martin A.C. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 732-745Google Scholar). Three different types of binding sites have been described: cavity, groove, and planar, which roughly correspond to hapten, peptide, and protein, respectively. This relationship has been further investigated by Vargas-Madrazo et al. (16Vargas-Madrazo E. Lara-Ochoa F. Almagro J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 497-504Google Scholar), who have described a correlation between the length of the CDR loops and the antigen recognized. According to these findings, cleft-like binding sites that recognize small molecules are created by long loops (especially the CDRH2 and L1 loops), whereas planar-binding sites that are specific for large molecules are formed by short loops. In other words, by modifying the loop lengths of an antibody-binding site, it may thus be possible to design antibodies optimally suited for recognition of a particular class of antigen. Lamminmäki et al. (17Lamminmäki U. Paupério S. Westerlund-Karlsson A. Karvinen J. Virtanen P.L. Lövgren T. Saviranta P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 589-602Google Scholar) have in fact used this approach to modify a murine antibody specific for 17β-estradiol. They introduced additional residues into CDR2 of the heavy domain and were able to improve the recognition of the antigen. This improvement was suggested to be the result of a deeper binding site, created through the extension of CDRH2, which better accommodated the hapten (17Lamminmäki U. Paupério S. Westerlund-Karlsson A. Karvinen J. Virtanen P.L. Lövgren T. Saviranta P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 589-602Google Scholar). Despite the establishment of insertions and deletions as naturally occurring modifications of antibody sequences and the use of amino acid insertions for antibody engineering, little is still known about the functional consequences of such modifications. We have therefore created single-codon insertions and deletions as well as more complex modifications in the CDR of two human antibody single chain V region fragments (scFv) specific for a peptide and a hapten, respectively, and investigated the effects on antigen recognition, thermal stability, and protein folding. Our results demonstrate that single amino acid insertions in both CDRH1 and H2 and deletions in CDRH2 are usually well tolerated and permit production of folded proteins despite the fact that the modified loops carry amino acids that are disallowed at key residue positions in canonical loops of the corresponding length or do not take on a characteristic length of a known canonical structure. Modifications of this kind are in other words an efficient mode of expanding antibody sequence and structure space beyond what is encoded by the germline gene repertoire, which may enable targeting of novel or otherwise poorly immunogenic antigens. The frameworks encoding the anti-cytomegalovirus scFv AE11F and the anti-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) scFv FITC8 have been described elsewhere (18Ohlin M. Sundqvist V.A. Mach M. Wahren B. Borrebaeck C.A.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 703-710Google Scholar, 19Ohlin M. Owman H. Mach M. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 47-56Google Scholar, 20Söderlind E. Strandberg L. Jirholt P. Kobayashi N. Alexeiva V. Åberg A.M. Nilsson A. Jansson B. Ohlin M. Wingren C. Danielsson L. Carlsson R. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 852-856Google Scholar). The cloning and production of the AE11F and AE11F/3-20L1 scFv in Pichia pastoris have also been described (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar). Mini-libraries of scFv genes carrying codon insertions at various positions were created by the use of overlap extension PCR with degenerate primers that introduced NNK codons. Variants with a deletion were similarly created with primers lacking one codon. The AE11F-based variants carrying CDRH1 sequences derived from the IGHV4 subgroup were created using the CDR-shuffling technique (22Jirholt P. Ohlin M. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Söderlind E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 471-476Google Scholar) essentially as described previously (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar, 23Lantto J. Jirholt P. Barrios Y. Ohlin M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 178: 303-316Google Scholar). The FITC8 scFv and all variant scFv were cloned into the pPICZα vector (Invitrogen) with C-terminal FLAG sequences (24Hopp T.P. Pricket K.S. Price V.L. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1204-1210Google Scholar) and produced inP. pastoris as described previously (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar). The mini-libraries encoding AE11F and FITC8 variants were screened for scFv production or antigen binding according to the colony lift assay by McGrew et al. (25McGrew J.T. Leiske D. Dell B. Klinke R. Krasts D. Wee S.F. Abbott N. Armitage R. Harrington K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 187: 193-200Google Scholar). Briefly, transformed P. pastoris colonies were lifted onto cellulose acetate filters (Pall Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) and were grown on top of nitrocellulose filters, which were placed on methanol-containing plates. After 48 h of induction, scFv bound to the nitrocellulose filters were detected by a combination of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and rabbit anti-mouse Ig/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) or FITC-biotin (Sigma) and streptavidin/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO A/S) using the ECL Plus™ Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Single colonies were also picked and grown in liquid cultures to enable further characterization of the antigen binding properties (see below). In addition, a number of scFv variants were produced at a larger scale and purified as monomers. The AE11F-based variants were purified essentially as described previously (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar), whereas the FITC8-based variants were purified by affinity chromatography on a Sepharose resin with FITC-conjugated bovine serum albumin (BSA) (kindly provided by Dr. B. Jansson, BioInvent Therapeutic AB, Lund, Sweden) followed by gel filtration as before. The reactivity of the scFv variants with different antigens, both as crude expression supernatants and as purified monomers, was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by using the BIAcore technology (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The AE11F-based clones were tested on BSA, ovalbumin, streptavidin, and a biotinylated peptide that mimics the viral epitope (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar) bound via streptavidin and the FITC8-based clones on BSA, streptavidin, FITC-BSA, FITC-biotin (bound via streptavidin), and a number of irrelevant BSA-coupled haptens obtained from Sigma or Biosearch Technologies Inc. (Novato, CA). The ELISA was performed according to standard protocols with anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) and rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (DAKO) to detect bound scFv. The BIAcore measurements and the calculation of the reaction rate kinetics were performed essentially as described previously (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar). DSC measurements were performed using a VP-DSC from Microcal Inc. (Northampton, MA) in the temperature range 20–90 °C at a heating rate of 60°/h. All measurements were performed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, containing 0.02% sodium azide at protein concentrations between 0.1 and 0.2 mg/ml with PBS in the reference cell. Prior to proteinversus PBS measurements, PBS versus PBS scans were performed. CD spectra were recorded on a J-720 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Easton, MD) in a 2-mm cuvette at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Each sample was scanned two to eight times from 250 to 200 nm at a scan speed of 10 nm/min, a resolution of 1 nm, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a sensitivity of 20 millidegrees, and the scans were combined to produce the final spectrum. Data are presented as mean residue molar ellipticity, which was calculated using the mean residue weight of each scFv. The nucleotide sequences of the variant scFv clones were determined by automated DNA sequencing as described elsewhere (26Jirholt P. Strandberg L. Jansson B. Krambovitis E. Söderlind E. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Carlsson R. Danielsson L. Ohlin M. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 67-74Google Scholar) after isolation of the templates by direct PCR on P. pastoris colonies using vector-specific primers. In the case of the CDRH1-grafted clones, the origin of the CDR was determined using the IMGT/V-QUEST alignment tool at IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics data base (imgt.cines.fr and Ref. 7Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 207-209Google Scholar). All sequences were defined and numbered in accordance with the IMGT nomenclature and unique numbering (7Lefranc M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 207-209Google Scholar). Complete sequences of the variant scFv from this study can be found in GenBankTM under accession codes AF543317–AF543349. The canonical structure classification was performed using the software implemented on the Antibodies – Structure and Sequence server (www.bioinf.org.uk/abs/chothia.html and Ref. 27Martin A.C. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 800-815Google Scholar). The parent antibody frameworks used in this study are both of human origin although there are differences in the way they were obtained. The AE11F scFv was derived from a monoclonal antibody isolated from a cytomegalovirus-seropositive blood donor (18Ohlin M. Sundqvist V.A. Mach M. Wahren B. Borrebaeck C.A.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 703-710Google Scholar, 19Ohlin M. Owman H. Mach M. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 47-56Google Scholar). It originates from the IGHV3–30 andIGKV3–11 genes, which both have acquired a number of mutations (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar). This scFv recognizes both intact glycoprotein B from cytomegalovirus and peptides mimicking the AD-2 epitope (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar, 28Lantto J. Fletcher J.M. Ohlin M. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2001-2005Google Scholar). The hapten (FITC)-specific scFv FITC8 was derived from a synthetic scFv library, which had been constructed by shuffling of human CDR sequences into a single framework consisting of the human IGHV3–23and IGLV1–47 genes (20Söderlind E. Strandberg L. Jirholt P. Kobayashi N. Alexeiva V. Åberg A.M. Nilsson A. Jansson B. Ohlin M. Wingren C. Danielsson L. Carlsson R. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 852-856Google Scholar). The CDR sequences utilized by this scFv originate from IGHV3–7 and IGHV3–23 in the case of CDRH1 and CDRH2, IGLV1–40 and IGLV1–40or IGLV1–50 in the case of CDRL1 and CDRL2, andIGLV1–47 in the case of CDRL3. Except for the CDRL1 loop, which is one residue longer than the IGLV1–47 germline length, the CDR loops of the FITC8 scFv are of the same length as the loops normally encoded by the framework genes. As the structures of the two scFv have not been determined, the loop structures are unknown. However, by analyzing the deduced amino acid sequences using the tools at the Antibodies – Structure and Sequence server (27Martin A.C. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 800-815Google Scholar), the most similar of the observed canonical classes were identified (Table I).Table IExamples of various single-codon modifications in scFv clones based on the AEIIF and FITC8 frameworks, the canonical class belonging of the CDR loops, reactivity of the scFv with the original antigens as determined by ELISA or by BIAcore measurements, and the unfolding temperature of selected clones as determined by DSCscFv cloneModificationCanonical classAntigen recognitionUnfolding temperatureH1-H2-L1°CAE11FOriginal sequence1-3-2++62.4ASV18Ins Pro-31A2-3-2+ASV19Ins Asn-31A2-3-2+ASV43Ins Arg-31A2-3-2+ASV15Ins His-32A2-3-2+ASV37Ins Ile-32A2-3-2±ASV39Ins Phe-32A2-3-2+ASV02Ins Phe-33A2-3-2±ASV35Ins Asn-33A2-3-2−ASV07Ins Lys-57A1-U aU indicates that the canonical structure of the created loop length is currently unknown.-2++63.0ASV08Ins Ile-57A1-U-2+ASV28Ins Thr-57A1-U-2++ASV05Ins Glu-58A1-U-2++ASV10Del Val-581-1-2±61.9AE11F/3–20L1Ins CDRL1bSee text for details regarding the insertion.1-3-6 cThe automatic canonical class algorithms failed to unambiguously predict a structure for the CDRL1 loop of this scFv.

To determine the capability of the two antibody frameworks to tolerate length modifications in the CDR loops, we made single-codon insertions in CDRH1 and CDRH2 and a single-codon deletion in CDRH2. The modifications involved insertions after positions 31–33 in CDRH1, insertions after positions 57 and 58 in CDRH2, and a deletion at position 58 in CDRH2 (Fig. 1). All modifications were introduced at positions corresponding to the apices of the loops, i.e.the positions where the natural length variation occurs (31Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Gherardi E. Tomlinson I.M. Walter G. Marks J.D. Llewelyn M.B. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 799-817Google Scholar). A study of the IGHV germline gene repertoire has shown that these parts of the CDR carry repetitive sequence tracts, which naturally target them with deletions (and possibly also insertions) during the hypermutational process (12Lantto J. Ohlin M. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 346-353Google Scholar). Residues in these regions have also been shown to frequently make contact with the antigen in known antibody-antigen complexes (15MacCallum R.M. Martin A.C. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 732-745Google Scholar), suggesting that modifications at the above mentioned positions will result in an expansion of structure space that is relevant for antigen recognition. Libraries of scFv clones producing different insertion variants were screened directly by the use of a colony lift assay (25McGrew J.T. Leiske D. Dell B. Klinke R. Krasts D. Wee S.F. Abbott N. Armitage R. Harrington K. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 187: 193-200Google Scholar). This analysis showed that ∼95% of the clones based on the FITC8 framework had retained their specificity for FITC (data not shown). The libraries based on the AE11F framework were screened for the production of FLAG-carrying proteins, and a similar ratio of clones positive for scFv production was obtained (data not shown). Both positive and negative clones from each library were sequenced to determine the nature of the modifications, and the analysis showed that a wide range of amino acids was inserted at the intended positions. To determine the effect of these length modifications on the structure of the targeted loops, the most similar canonical structures were identified by the automatic canonical structure classification (27Martin A.C. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 800-815Google Scholar). A number of examples from each insertion library and the deletion variants are presented in TableI. As the AE11F-based libraries were only tested for the production of FLAG-tagged proteins, they had to be characterized further to determine whether the scFv were functionally folded. This was done by analyzing the antigen-binding properties of the modified clones. Although changes in loop structure may be associated with a loss of antigen recognition, specific recognition of an antigen will confirm that the polypeptide chain is correctly folded as this is a requirement for it to function as a framework for the antigen-binding site. Analysis of expression supernatants of randomly picked clones (including the deletion variants) by ELISA or by using the BIAcore technology confirmed the above finding that the majority of the FITC8-based clones recognized the original antigen. Importantly, this analysis showed that most of the AE11F-based clones had also retained their specificity for the original viral antigen (Table I). Furthermore, when tested for binding to a number of irrelevant antigens (see “Experimental Procedures”), none of the clones displayed any cross-reactivity (data not shown), demonstrating that the modified scFv clones retained a high degree of specificity for the original antigens and therefore likely also assumed a correct immunoglobulin fold. A number of clones of each specificity, chosen to exemplify the different modifications, were produced at a large scale to study the interaction with the original antigens in detail and determine the stability of the purified proteins. BIAcore measurements with the purified monomers of the ASV07, ASV10, ASV35, FSV43, FSV61, and FSV84 clones confirmed the previously obtained results with crude expression supernatants (Table I and Fig. 2). Furthermore, evaluation of the reaction rate kinetics with the original antigen showed that the modifications did not affect the dissociation rates of the FITC8-based clones to any greater extent (Fig.2 B). The thermal stability of the purified monomers was determined by DSC, and all tested clones displayed unfolding temperatures very similar to the parent scFv (Table I), further verifying that the IGHV3-derived antibody frameworks tolerate single-codon insertions and deletions in CDRH1 and H2 very well. As insertions and deletions have been demonstrated to occur naturally in both heavy and light domain V genes (8de Wildt R.M. van Venrooij W.J. Winter G. Hoet R.M. Tomlinson I.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 701-710Google Scholar), we decided to extend this study and also evaluate the stability of a previously produced AE11F-based scFv variant with an insertion in CDRL1 (AE11F/3-20L1) (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar). The modified CDRL1 of this scFv is identical, except for an additional serine residue, to the germline gene from which AE11F originates. This clone has also been demonstrated to recognize both the epitope-mimicking peptide and intact, recombinant glycoprotein B, albeit with a lower affinity than the affinity matured AE11F scFv (21Lantto J. Lindroth Y. Ohlin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1659-1669Google Scholar, 32Lantto J. Fletcher J.M. Ohlin M. Virology. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The thermal stability of the AE11F/3-20L1 scFv was determined as before after purification of monomeric scFv, and the unfolding temperature was found to be similar to that of the original scFv (Table I), thus indicating that not only heavy but also light domain CDR tolerate modifications of this nature well. As all of the insertions and deletions described so far were introduced at the tips of the hypervariable loops, the parts of the immunoglobulin fold that best can be expected to accommodate such modifications, we decided to introduce more extensive modifications to investigate the effect of such changes of antibody sequence and structure. These modifications were introduced into and immediately adjacent to CDRH1 of the AE11F framework by the CDR-shuffling technique (22Jirholt P. Ohlin M. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Söderlind E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 215: 471-476Google Scholar) using CDR sequences isolated from activated human B cells. Sequences originating from the IGHV4 subgroup were chosen for the grafting as these are only distantly related to the IGHV3 CDR and therefore allow for a higher degree of variability. In addition, genes from the IGHV4 subgroup encode loops of different lengths than genes from the IGHV3 subgroup, including loops of the same length as the ones created by the single-codon insertions in CDRH1, thus enabling a comparison with these modifications. Sequencing of randomly picked clones showed that seemingly functional, i.e. in-frame and without stop codons, IGHV3 genes carrying IGHV4-derived CDRH1 sequences were obtained (TableII). However, when analyzing crude expression supernatants of the constructs, it was found that all of the clones had lost the original antigen specificity and instead acquired a polyreactive character (Fig. 3).Table IIDeduced amino acid sequences, germline gene origin, and canonical structure class belonging of the CDRH1 loops of the AE11F scFv and the CDRHI-grafted variants of thisscFv cloneAmino acid sequenceGermline originCanonical structure2 3 33334 42 0 45690 4AE11FSCAASGFIFSEYD–-MHWVRQIGHV3-301E3...V..GSI.SGGYYWS.I..IGHV4-313E6...V..YSI.SGYY-WG.I..IGHV4-b2E10...V..GSI.S.Y-–WS.I..IGHV4-591E11...V..GSI.G.H–-WS.I..IGHV4-341E14...V..GSI.SGGYSWS.I..IGHV4-30-23Amino acid sequences are aligned and numbered in accordance with the IMGT unique numbering (7Lefranc M.P.

Finally, prostaglandin H2 serves as a common substrate for the various isomerases which catalyze the final step in the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane A2 (TxA2). Much attention has been devoted to the step catalyzed by PGHS since it is the target of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (2Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. DeWitt D.L. Hla T. Funk C.D. Smith W.L. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 271: 927-934Google Scholar). Two distinct PGHS enzymes are known, PGHS-1 and PGHS-2, and both catalyze the formation of prostaglandin H2from arachidonic acid (3Laneuville O. Breuer D.K. Xu N. Huang Z.H. Gage D.A. Watson J.T. Lagarde M. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19330-19336Google Scholar). The two PGHS have different profiles of expression; PGHS-1 is present in almost all tissues, and stimulation with hormones or mitogenic agents does not affect its basal levels significantly (4Smith W.L. Garavito R.M. DeWitt D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33157-33160Google Scholar). In contrast, PGHS-2 enzyme becomes detectable in certain contexts such as inflammation, cancer, or on addition of mitogenic agents (5Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Google Scholar). Although we have a great understanding of the regulatory mechanisms leading to the induction of PGHS-2 gene, the response elements and factors regulating the expression of PGHS-1gene are essentially unknown. PGHS-1 gene has a TATA-less promoter, is CG rich, and contains multiple potential start sites for transcription (6Xu X.M. Tang J.L. Chen X. Wang L.H. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6943-6950Google Scholar). A promoter study, using human umbilical vein endothelial cells, has shown that the 916-nucleotides sequence located upstream from the transcriptional start site had very low promoter activity and a modest increase of 1.8-fold was reported after TPA treatment (6Xu X.M. Tang J.L. Chen X. Wang L.H. Wu K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6943-6950Google Scholar). A few studies have shown variations in PGHS-1 mRNA and protein levels, notably, during the development of ovine lung (7Brannon T.S. North A.J. Wells L.B. Shaul P.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2230-2235Google Scholar), as well as during TPA-induced differentiation of monocytes (THP-1) cells to a macrophage phenotype (8Smith C.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J. Marnett L.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 400: 99-106Google Scholar). Thus far, mechanisms regulating the basal expression ofPGHS-1 gene as well as its induction during development and differentiation have not been described. To study the regulation of expression of the PGHS-1 gene, we have chosen the megakaryocytic cell line MEG-01 induced to differentiate into platelet-like structures on addition of TPA (9Ogura M. Morishima Y. Okumura M. Hotta T. Takamoto S. Ohno R. Hirabayashi N. Nagura H. Saito H. Blood. 1988; 72: 49-60Google Scholar). Using this model, we have monitored the levels of PGHS-1 protein and mRNA during MEG-01 differentiation; the highest levels of PGHS-1 protein were measured in the most differentiated cells, the enucleated platelet-like population, whereas PGHS-1 mRNA levels were greatest in the nucleated adherent population (10Mroske C. Plant M.H. Franks D.J. Laneuville O. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 411-421Google Scholar). We also performed a time-course study and noted that only mRNA levels were increased at day 1 after addition of TPA whereas both mRNA and protein increased at day 4 after stimulation (11Plant M.H. Laneuville O. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 677-685Google Scholar). The delay in PGHS-1 enzyme accumulation we observed is not unique to MEG-01 cells. Similar to our observation, the levels of PGHS-1 mRNA and protein were maximal at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, after treatment of human astrocyte cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors (12Taniura S. Kamitani H. Watanabe T. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16823-16830Google Scholar). PGHS-1 was also up-regulated by retinoic acid during neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma cell lines, and PGHS-1 protein increase occurred 1 day after mRNA increase (13Schneider N. Lanz S. Ramer R. Schaefer D. Goppelt-Struebe M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 416-424Google Scholar). These reports of a delayed accumulation of PGHS-1 enzyme relative to the increase in mRNA levels suggest that PGHS-1 protein synthesis could be under the control of a mechanism yet to be defined. In the current study, we report that although the steady-state levels of PGHS-1 mRNA are comparable at days 1 and 4, synthesis of PGHS-1 protein occurred at day 4 only. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the delay of PGHS-1 protein synthesis, we have identified a conserved 20-nt segment in the 3′UTR and have used it in RNA gel shift assays. We provide evidences for specific protein interactions with the 20-nt conserved segment of the PGHS-1 3′UTR in control or in 1-day-TPA-treated cells. The sequence-specific interaction was not observed using extracts from cells treated for 4 days that contain high levels of PGHS-1 protein. Our experiments indicate the presence of RNA-binding proteins (complex C) that bind to the 20-nt conservedcis element of the 3′UTR of PGHS-1 transcript, likely silencing its translation early after TPA stimulation. MEG-01 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum without antibiotics as previously published by our laboratory (11Plant M.H. Laneuville O. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 677-685Google Scholar). TPA was added to each culture at a final concentration of 16 nm. Control cells were treated with the same (CH3)2SO concentration that TPA-treated cells received (0.0001% v/v). Cells were incubated (37 °C, air/CO2 (19:1)) for 1 or 4 days and were harvested for RNA or protein analysis, enzymatic activity, metabolic labeling, or gel mobility-shift assays. Total RNA was extracted from MEG-01 cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen), mainly as we have described previously (11Plant M.H. Laneuville O. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 677-685Google Scholar). For Northern blot analysis, after gel separation and transfer, nylon membranes were prehybridized in 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, 20 mm Tris-Cl for 30 min. at 42 °C with 30 μg/ml of herring sperm DNA. Hybridization was done at 42 °C overnight using random-primed 32P-labeled PGHS-1 cDNA corresponding to the entire open reading frame, as a probe. The membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC/0.05% SDS at room temperature and then once in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min. The membranes were then exposed on phosphorscreen to visualize mRNA. The 32P-labeled human β-actin cDNA was used as control for the quantity of RNA loaded in each lane. For analysis of ribosomal RNA, total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107MEG-01 cells, resolved on 1% agarose gels, and stained with ethidium bromide. Protein isolation, quantification, and Western blotting were done as described previously (11Plant M.H. Laneuville O. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 677-685Google Scholar). Samples (10 μg of total protein) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The primary anti-PGHS-1 antibody is directed against residues Leu272-Gln283 of hPGHS-1 (gift of Dr. W. L. Smith, Michigan State University), and detected with anti-rabbit IgG linked to horseradish peroxidase (Promega). Protein bands were visualized using the Roche Molecular Biochemicals Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate detection system (POD) and photographed on Polaroid black and white Polapan 667 film. The membranes were incubated simultaneously with an anti-actin antibody developed in rabbit (Sigma) (loading control). For the MG-132 experiment, after stripping, membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Sigma) as a positive control for the proteasome inhibitor treatment; c-Myc was detected with an anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Promega). Sheep PGHS-1 purified from vesicular glands was used as a standard (1 μg) (provided from Dr. W. L. Smith). Thromboxane synthesis by intact MEG-01 cells was measured at 1 day and 4 days after TPA treatment. Cells (106) were removed from culture dishes, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium per 25 ml of culture. The substrate, [1-14C]arachidonic acid (final concentration of 10 μm; 42 mCi/mm) was added, and the cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To terminate the reaction, the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 ×g, and the medium was removed. Proteins from the medium were precipitated by adding 1 volume of ice-cold acetone. The supernatant containing the radioactive prostanoid products, mainly TxB2, and unreacted arachidonic acid was acidified with 1 volume of 0.1 m HCl and extracted with 3 volumes of ethyl acetate/methanol/0.2 m citric acid (30/4/1). The organic phase was evaporated to dryness under a stream of N2 and resuspended in 50 μl of the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) solvent: ethyl acetate/2,2,4-trimethylpentane/acetic acid, saturated with water. Samples were applied to a silica gel 60 TLC plate (VWR). The lipid products were separated by chromatography and detected by exposure to x-ray film for 40 h. Radioactive TxB2 was identified by comparison with an authentic TxB2 standard and quantified by densitometry analysis. MEG-01 cells were cultured as described above and treated or not with TPA for 1 or 4 days. Drugs were added 8 h before harvesting at the following concentrations: MG-132 (Sigma), 100 μm; chloroquine (Sigma), 100 μm; and PD150606 (Calbiochem), 20 μm. Both MG-132 and PD150606 were dissolved in (CH3)2SO at 100 mm and 20 mm, respectively, and chloroquine was dissolved in water at 100 mm. MEG-01 cells (2 × 107 cells) were treated with TPA for 1 or 4 days. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 7 000 ×g, washed in methionine-free medium, and resuspended in 4 ml of methionine-free RPMI. The cells were incubated 15 min at 37 °C to deplete the intracellular pools of methionine and metabolically labeled by incubation for 30 min with [35S]methionine (50 μCi/ml). To prepare lysates, the cells were suspended in a mixture of 20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Before immunoprecipitation, an aliquot (2.5% of total volume) of the lysates were kept and run on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Newly synthesized35S-labeled PGHS-1 was immunoprecipitated from lysates by using rabbit anti-human PGHS-1 IgG and protein A-Sepharose in the lysis buffer. Proteins were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and allowed to expose onto MR film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). PGHS-1 standard was run in parallel and stained with Coomassie Blue to confirm band identity. Expression vector pGEM-3Z (Promega) was previously digested withEcoRI and HindIII and isolated from agarose gel. The following oligonucleotides were designed to anneal to each other (annealing: 65 °C for 5 min and 15 min on ice) and to be ligated into the linear pGEM-3Z vector: oligo 1) 5′-AATTCCTCGAG TTCATTTTCCTGTTCAGTGAA-3′ and oligo 2) 5′-AGCTTTCACTGAACAGGAAAATGAA CTCGAGG-3′. The bold characters represent the conserved 20-nt sequence; the 5′ and 3′ extremities correspond either to the EcoRI orHindIII cohesive ends of the linear plasmid; the underlined sequence is the XhoI site used to identify positive clones. The same approach was used to generate the antisense and mutated sequences constructs (see Figs. 5 A and 8 A for exact probe sequences). The total length of each probe produced by this method was 37 nt. Uncapped sense, antisense, and mutant probes were transcribed from the corresponding pGEM-3Z-hPGHS-1–3′UTR vector linearized with HindIII, using T7 RNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Biosciences, PB20383, 20 mCi/ml) and 0.5 mm each of ATP, CTP, and GTP and 0.05 mm UTP for 2 h at 37 °C. The radiolabeled probes were recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation with tRNA after digestion of DNA template with DNase/RNase Free. The radiolabeled transcripts were verified on acrylamide gels and used directly in RNA mobility-shift assays after dilution at 200,000 cpm/μl or at 1 pmol of probe per binding reaction, based on their respective specific activities.Figure 8Mutations in the PGHS-1 3′-UTR 20-nt segment affecting the specific binding activity. A, sequences of the non-mutated probe (NM) and of 5 mutated probes (M1 to M5) used in RNA-EMSA. Italic characters indicate different point mutations into the conserved 20-nt sequence (boldcharacters), and more particularly into the UUUU tetranucleotide (framed sequence). For each mutated probe, formation of complex C is reported based on the RNA-EMSA results. B, RNA-EMSA representative of three independent experiments where32P-labeled non-mutated probe or mutant probe was incubated in presence of control MEG-01 lysate (20 μg) and heparin (2.5 μg/μl). As shown by the arrow, complex C formation was observed using NM, M1, or M2 probe, whereas complex C formation was absent with probe M3, M4, or M5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cells were incubated for 1 or 4 days with or without TPA, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and cellular extracts were obtained as described by Dignam (14Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 194-203Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the use of a BioRad protein assay kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Binding reactions were carried out with 10–20 μg of MEG-01 protein extract and 200,000 cpm of hPGHS-1–3′UTR 32P-labeled transcript, and were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 1× binding buffer (20 mmHepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, Tween 20® 0.2% (w/v), 30 mmKCl) in a total volume of 20 μl, to allow the formation of complexes. Heparin was added to different final concentrations and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were then placed on ice and irradiated for 10 min in a Stratalinker chamber (Stratagene 2400) at a distance of 6 cm from the light source, prior to electrophoresis on 5% native polyacrylamide (29:1 acrylamide:bis-acrylamide) gels in 0.5× TBE buffer. These binding reactions were analyzed by autoradiography. In some assays, cellular extracts were preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with different competitor RNAs or treatments, such as proteinase K, SDS, or heat denaturation before addition of the riboprobe. For complex C analysis, RNA-EMSA reactions submitted to UV irradiations as described above were resolved on 5% native gels. Complex C from 5 binding reactions was cut and pooled, and proteins were eluted in 50 mm (NH4) 2HCO3 buffer containing 0.001% SDS and 0.02 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 16 h with shaking. After elution, volume was concentrated on centrifugal filter devices (Centricon® and Ultrafree®-MC YM-10, Millipore) to a volume of 40 μl, and complex protein components were resolved on gradient (4–19%) polyacrylamide gels in denaturing conditions. Proteins were visualized with Sypro Tangerine protein gel stain (Molecular Probe, S12010). Dried gels were then exposed to PhosphorImaging screen for detection of proteins linked to the RNA probe. The temporal relationship between PGHS-1 mRNA, PGHS-1 protein, and PGHS-1 activity in TPA-treated MEG-01 cells was examined. The steady-state level of PGHS-1 mRNA was measured by Northern blot analysis and was normalized by comparison to β-actin mRNA (Fig.1 A). In agreement with previous results we have reported, increase in mRNA was detected at maximum at 1 day after TPA treatment and remained high for at least 4 days (11Plant M.H. Laneuville O. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 677-685Google Scholar). The steady-state level of PGHS-1 protein was measured by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). PGHS-1 enzyme increased disproportionately compared with PGHS-1 mRNA; there was no detectable PGHS-1 protein after 1 day of TPA stimulation and a strong signal after 4 days. Therefore, a significant delay in PGHS-1 protein accumulation occurred in TPA-treated MEG-01 cells. The activity of the PGHS-1 enzyme was measured by incubating the cells with the radioactive substrate arachidonic acid and analyzing the formation of TxB2, the stable metabolite of TxA2. The formation of TxB2 increased proportionally to the levels of PGHS-1 enzyme, i.e. low at 1 day after TPA stimulation and high at 4 days (Fig. 1 C), indicating that differences in PGHS-1 protein levels measured by Western blot are not an artifact. The possibility that thromboxane synthase protein and/or activity might limit the formation of TxB2 (Fig. 1 C) was excluded on the basis of a study reporting low formation of TxB2 despite high levels of thromboxane synthase protein in unstimulated MEG-01 cells (24Matijevic-Aleksic N. Sanduja S.K. Wang L.H. Wu K.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1269: 167-175Google Scholar). Also, this study reports very little variation in thromboxane synthase levels after TPA stimulation. The low levels of PGHS-1 protein at day 1 after TPA treatment despite a high level of transcript is consistent with either a low rate of protein synthesis or a high rate of protein degradation. In order to evaluate the importance of PGHS-1 protein degradation, cells were incubated for 8 h before harvesting with one of the following proteolytic system inhibitors: 100 μm MG-132, 20 μm PD-150606, or 100 μm chloroquine. The steady-state levels of PGHS-1 protein in presence or absence of MG-132, a proteasome inhibitor, were nearly identical, being undetectable in control cells and at day 1 after TPA treatment but high at day 4 (Fig.2). As a positive control for MG-132 treatment, c-Myc protein, known to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, was monitored. In agreement to the literature, c-Myc levels increased when MG-132 is added to the cells (15Gross-Mesilaty S. Reinstein E. Bercovich B. Tobias K.E. Schwartz A.L. Kahana C. Ciechanover A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8058-8063Google Scholar). PGHS-1 protein was also not detected in 1-day-TPA-treated cells subjected to other drugs such as the calpain inhibitor, PD-150606, or the lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine, thus excluding a high rate of degradation as an explanation for the lack of PGHS-1 protein after 1 day of TPA treatment (data not shown). To confirm the low rate of synthesis of PGHS-1 protein at 1 day after TPA treatment, de novo synthesis was measured by pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine. Labeled PGHS-1 levels in the lysate were determined by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-human PGHS-1 IgG, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography. The lysate of cells treated with TPA for 4 days contained newly synthesized PGHS-1, but essentially no new PGHS-1 protein was detected after treatment of the cells for 1 day (Fig. 3 A). These results suggest that the low level of PGHS-1 enzyme at day 1 after TPA treatment is due to a relatively lower level of PGHS-1 protein synthesis. To determine whether there is an increase in overall protein synthesis at 4 days after TPA treatment, we also analyzed labeled proteins before performing the PGHS-1 immunoprecipitation. Starting with the same number of viable cells (2 × 107) at 1 and 4 days after TPA stimulation, we observed less overall incorporation of [35S]methionine when cells are treated for 4 days compared with 1 day (Fig. 3 B,left panel). Ribosomal abundance was also reduced in the TPA 4-day samples (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Despite a decrease in the overall protein synthesis and a reduction in ribosomal abundance after 4 days of TPA treatment, the synthesis and steady-state levels of PGHS-1 protein were increased. The 3′-UTR of translationally regulated transcripts is a predominant site of regulation. In most cases of translational control, a cellular RNA-binding protein binds to a cis-acting element of the targeted message. Seeking for a potential site for regulation, we aligned the PGHS-1 3′-UTR from four different species and identified a 20-nt sequence perfectly conserved. For the human PGHS-1 transcript, the 20-nt sequence is located at the 491st nt after the stop codon (Fig. 4 A). Interacting proteins were detected by an RNA electrophoretic mobility-shift assay (EMSA) by using the [α-32P]UTP-labeled PGHS-1 20-nt conserved sequence as a probe. In the presence of increasing concentrations of heparin (1–5 μg/μl), the probe was retarded by extracts from control MEG-01 cells or cells treated with TPA for 1 day; four RNA-protein complexes, termed A, B, C, and D, were formed (Fig.4 B). None of the four complexes was detected in extracts from cells treated with TPA for 4 days. Thus, RNA-EMSA demonstrated that the formation of complexes A–D with the 20-nt conserved sequence is both time- and TPA-dependent. Extracts from the 4-day-treated cells produced a single complex, termed T, the intensity of which increased with the duration of the TPA exposure (Fig.4 B). To exclude the possibility of protein degradation or of an underestimation of protein amount used in the 4-day-TPA extract, the four extracts were run on SDS-PAGE stained with silver and have shown similar profiles (Fig. 4 C). The absence of complexes A–D with the 4-day-treated MEG-01 extract correlated with a high level of PGHS-1 protein in this extract as monitored by Western blot (Fig.4 D). These results suggest that the complexes A–D could comprise PGHS-1 mRNA-binding proteins regulating PGHS-1 translational activity negatively. The sequence specificity of all observed complexes was determined using an antisense probe that included the same restriction site sequences present in the sense probe and the PGHS-1 20-nt sequence in the opposite orientation (Fig.5 A). As shown in Fig.5 B (left panel), only one complex (complex C, indicated by the arrow) was not detected with the antisense probe incubated with extracts from control MEG-01 cells. Complex T, observed with the 4-day TPA extract, was also formed with the antisense probe (Fig. 5 B, right panel). Therefore the formation of complexes A, B, D, and T is both time- and TPA-dependent but not sequence specific. Addition of an excess amount of the unlabeled 20-nt sense probe to the binding reactions diminished the formation of complex C in a concentration-dependent manner (data not shown). The next experiments were designed to study complex C formation, which is time- and TPA-dependent and specific to the 20-nt conserved sequence in the PGHS-1 3′-UTR. The protein content in the complex C was confirmed by digestion or denaturation of the control MEG-01 extract before its addition to the binding reaction. Incubation of cell extracts with proteinase K alone or in presence of SDS, or denaturing cell extracts with SDS or heat all prevented complex formation (Fig. 6, line 4 to 7). Heating the probe before incubation with untreated MEG-01 extracts did not abolish complex formation (Fig. 6, line 8). Incubation of the probe with RNase A/T1 before incubation with a cell extract from control MEG-01 (Fig. 6, line 9) did not lead to complex formation, indicating that complexes do not result from binding with free labeled nucleotides or aborted shorter probes. Thus, formed complexes include protein(s), and the nucleotide sequence rather than the conformation were critical for the binding of proteins. To identify the nucleotides of the conserved sequence that are crucial for complex C formation, we performed competition experiments and design mutants lacking binding activity. Extracts prepared from control MEG-01 cells were preincubated with increasing amounts of ribonucleotides, either poly(U), poly(C), or poly(A), before the addition of the sense probe to the binding reactions. As shown in Fig. 7, the formation of complex C was partially competed by poly(U) additions as low as 10 ng and completely competed by an excess of 1000 ng. However, poly(C) or poly(A) did not significantly attenuate its formation at any concentration tested. The binding activity from MEG-01 extracts therefore binds preferentially U-rich sequence correlating with the fact that 50% of the nucleotides composing the 20-nt conserved sequence are U residues, of which four are found consecutively. Next, we designed mutated probes listed in figure 8A and used them in RNA-EMSA. First, we arbitrarily substituted 1 of 2 nucleotides (mutant 1) and observed that the formation of complex C was reduced but not abolished. Next, we targeted the four consecutive U residues in the conserved sequence and analyzed their binding activity. As shown in Fig. 8, substitution of the UUUU sequence to CUGA, UUGA, and CUUA (mutants 3–5 respectively) completely abolished the formation of complex C. Mutating only the second of the four consecutive U residues (UCUU, mutant 2) permitted formation of complex C. Therefore, the U residues of the 20-nt sequence and in particular the UUUU motif are important for the formation of complex C. To further characterize the protein(s) that interact with the 20-nt conserved region of the PGHS-1 3′-UTR, we first resolved, on native gels, binding reactions submitted to UV irradiations. Complex C was cut, eluted from the gel, and resolved on a gradient SDS-PAGE. Gels were first stained with SYPRO Tangerine stain to visualize all the proteins. Dried gels were then exposed to a PhosphorImaging screen to identify proteins interacting with the RNA probe. The stained gel showed that complex C is composed of at least 5 proteins with apparent molecular mass varying from 20–100 kDa with two major bands at ∼45 kDa and 100 kDa (Fig. 9, left panel). Strikingly, a doublet migrating at around 116 kDa and a band at 45 kDa were radioactive, indicating that these proteins are likely to bind the 20-nt sequence (Fig. 9, right panel). As a first step to characterize PGHS-1 expression, we analyzed steady-state levels of PGHS-1 mRNA and protein in a megakaryocytic cell line induced to differentiate. The levels of PGHS-1 mRNA were maximal at 1 day and remained elevated for at least 4 days after treatment with TPA, while PGHS-1 protein was not detected at 1 day, but levels were high at day 4. We hypothesized that a delay at the translational step was responsible for the lack of PGHS-1 protein at day 1 after TPA treatment. To support this hypothesis, we measuredde novo synthesis of PGHS-1 enzyme with metabolic labeling experiments and found no PGHS-1 synthesized at day 1, but synthesis did occur at day 4. As a potential mechanism that may mediate the lack of PGHS-1 translation in control MEG-01 cells or early after TPA stimulation, we report the binding of 45- and 116-kDa proteins to a 20-nt conserved sequence located in the 3′-UTR of the PGHS-1 transcript. Our current results suggest that protein extracts from control or 1-day-TPA-treated MEG-01 cells bound to the 20-nt conserved sequence in the 3′-UTR. This binding referred to as complexes A–D, was occurring in the absence of PGHS-1 synthesis. To the opposite, the synthesis of PGHS-1 enzyme correlated with the formation of complex T. The conserved sequence in the PGHS-1 3′-UTR appears to be unique, as a BLAST search has revealed that it is not found in any other gene. Similar to previously reported mRNA cis element, there is only one copy of the 20-nt cis element within the PGHS-1 message. A literature search has allowed us to identify other known 20-ntcis elements in the 3′-UTRs of c-fos (16You Y. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2931-2940Google Scholar), β2-adrenergic receptor (17Tholanikunnel B.G. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11471-11478Google Scholar), peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (18Fraboulet S. Boudouresque F. Delfino C. Ouafik L. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 894-904Google Scholar), and ribonucleotide reductase R2 (19Amara F.M. Smith G.M. Kuschak T.I. Takeuchi T.L. Wright J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 228: 347-351Google Scholar) that mediate translational regulation. These 20-nt sequences have no homology to the PGHS-1 3′-UTR conserved sequence but, like PGHS-1 conserved sequence, all contain stretches of uridylate residues important for the binding activity. The sequence-specific complex formed (complex C) with the 20-nt conserved sequence includes proteins of 116 and of 45 kDa that cross-linked to the RNA probe. Based on our observations that the U stretch is crucial for protein binding, we predict that proteins known to bind A + U-rich nucleotide regions, including the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, in particular heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins C, migrating at ∼45 kDa, are potential candidates (20Dreyfuss G. Matunis M.J. Pinol-Roma S. Burd C.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Google Scholar). The importance of translational regulation for the expression of thePGHS-1gene is only speculative at this stage. The overall reduction of ribosomal RNA after TPA treatment is consistent with previous reports of a suppression of ribosomal biogenesis that accompany terminal differentiation of myeloid cells (21Kroll S.L. Barth-Baus D. Hensold J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49410-49418Google Scholar). As suggested, a decrease in ribosomal biogenesis may be necessary to allow cells to redirect gene expression away from proteins involved in growth and toward those characterizing differentiated cells. For the differentiating MEG-01 cells, PGHS-1 protein synthesis would be favored despite a significant reduction of the levels of ribosomes, strengthening the importance of translational regulation forPGHS-1gene expression. We have reported that PGHS-1 protein levels show a consistent increase over the entire course of differentiation of MEG-01 cells, that is, from blast cell to platelet-shedding megakaryocyte (10Mroske C. Plant M.H. Franks D.J. Laneuville O. Exp. Hematol. 2000; 28: 411-421Google Scholar). It is well established that platelets represent one of richest source of PGHS-1 enzyme in the body, but the molecular mechanisms leading to this are unknown (22Funk C.D. Funk L.B. Kennedy M.E. Pong A.S. Fitzgerald G.A. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2304-2312Google Scholar). The most likely role of the translational regulation we document here would be to prevent the accumulation of PGHS-1 protein early in megakaryocyte differentiation. In this context, when differentiation of the platelet precursor cells is triggered by the hematopoietic factors, the levels of PGHS-1 mRNA would rapidly increase, but protein synthesis would be delayed until differentiation of the cells has reached the stage of releasing platelets. In a model similar to megakaryocytic maturation, erythroid differentiation is associated with the translational silencing of the 15-lipoxygenasegene (23Ostareck-Lederer A. Ostareck D.H. Standart N. Thiele B.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1476-1481Google Scholar). 15-Lipoxygenase mRNA is synthesized in the erythroid precursors of the bone marrow but remained untranslated until the maturation of reticulocytes into red blood cells. Interestingly, PGHS-1 enzyme metabolizes the same substrate as 15-lipoxygenase (arachidonic acid), and both enzymes are found at high levels in enucleated blood cells (the platelets and the red blood cells, respectively). In summary, in the setting of TPA-induced MEG-01 differentiation, the increase in the steady state levels of PGHS-1 protein could be accounted for by the increase in PGHS-1 synthesis, based on [35S]methionine labeling, suggesting that translational regulation is a significant means of PGHS-1regulation. We have identified a 20-nt conserved region in the 3′-UTR of the PGHS-1 transcript as a potential regulatory site. We report a correlation between the association of proteins to this cis element and the lack of PGHS-1 protein synthesis. We have identified a stretch of four U residues within the 20-nt conserved sequence that is essential for binding activity. Last, we have determined the size of the PGHS-1 mRNA-binding proteins, and their identity remains to be elucidated. We thank Adele Boudreau for her technical contribution."
https://openalex.org/W2024757748,"PI-TfuI, an intein spliced from the DNA polymerase of Thermococcus fumicolans, is a highly specific endonuclease, whose cleavage efficiency and specificity depend on both the substrate topology and the divalent cation used as cofactor. An open circular intermediate was observed during the cleavage of supercoiled DNA by PI-TfuI, suggesting a two-step cleavage of the DNA. We characterized this nicked intermediate and, through the development of a method of analysis of the cleavage reaction based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we demonstrated that the cleavage of DNA by PI-TfuI indeed results from two cleavage events. One step results in the cleavage of the bottom strand, which is independent of the DNA conformation or choice of the metal ion cofactor. A second step, which is slower, leads to the cleavage of the top strand and governs the specific requirements of PI-TfuI concerning the essential cofactor and the DNA topology. These two steps were shown to be independent in optimal conditions of cleavage. These data give support to the existence of two distinct and independent active sites in the endonuclease domain of the archaeal intein.

These data give support to the existence of two distinct and independent active sites in the endonuclease domain of the archaeal intein. Among the 34 proteins known to harbor inteins, archaeal DNA polymerases are the preferred hosts (Inbase, the New England Biolabs intein data base at www.neb.com/inteins/intein_intro.html; Inteins-Protein introns web site at bioinfo.weizmann.ac.il/∼pietro/inteins/). Indeed, 8 of the DNA polymerase genes from archaebacteria sequenced to date enclose 1 to 3 invading sequences. The intein coding sequences are inserted in-frame in the host genes, which are transcribed and translated into large precursor peptides. The subsequent protein splicing of these precursors is autocatalytic; it produces the mature DNA polymerases and liberates the inteins, which are also stable proteins. Among the 15 inteins recessed in archaeal DNA polymerase, 14 are potential endonucleases and only one is a mini-intein lacking the central endonuclease domain (1Dalgaard J.Z. Klar A.J. Moser M.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4391-4396Google Scholar). Besides, six other inteins are known to possess a specific endonuclease activity. Two are inserted in the Pyrococcus furiosis ribonucleotide reductase (8Komori K. Fujita N. Ichiyanagi K. Shinagawa H. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4167-4174Google Scholar, 9Komori K. Ichiyanagi K. Morikawa K. Ishino Y.

In this yeast, it was shown that the highly specific endonuclease activity of the PI-SceI intein confers to the intein coding sequence a specific mobility known as “homing” (13Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Google Scholar). The endonuclease activity of these 14 inteins was individually studied (3Perler F.B. Comb D.G. Jack W.E. Moran L.S. Qiang B. Kucera R.B. Benner J.

Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Google Scholar) and common features are observed. They recognize and cleave long asymmetrical sequences: a 16 to 31-bp sequence spanning the intein insertion site in the inteinless allele of their host gene is the substrate of the intein, the cleavage leaving a 4-base long 3′-hydroxyl overhang. Whereas PI-SceI and mycobacterial inteins cleave DNA at 37 °C, all other inteins are thermophilic enzymes that are active at temperatures ranging from 50 to 100 °C. The endonuclease activity of inteins requires a divalent cation, usually Mg2+. This cation is an essential cofactor for the phosphodiester bonds hydrolysis but is usually not required for DNA binding with the exception of PI-PfuI binding to its target sequence. All these enzymes are active at pH about 8–8.5 and, in a few cases, the catalysis is enhanced in the presence of monovalent ions. Although some inteins have been found to form only one specific complex with their target DNA, PI-SceI interacts with DNA, as a monomer, in a biphasic pathway aimed to settle the scissible bonds into the active site, and thus induces the double-stranded DNA cleavage without accumulation of a nicked intermediate (14Wende W. Grindl W. Christ F. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4123-4132Google Scholar, 15Gimble F.S. Wang J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 163-180Google Scholar). These observations raised the question of whether the cleavage reaction of the double-stranded DNA is performed by only one catalytic center that simultaneously cleaves the two DNA strands following a single binding event or by two catalytic centers that act in a concerted reaction. The existence of two separate active sites is fairly suggested. First, the 2 LAGLIDADG motifs, which are spaced by ∼100 amino acids in the primary structure of most inteins are involved in the endonuclease activity (9Komori K. Ichiyanagi K. Morikawa K. Ishino Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4175-4182Google Scholar, 16Hodges R.A. Perler F.B. Noren C.J. Jack W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6153-6157Google Scholar, 17Gimble F.S. Stephens B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5849-5856Google Scholar). Second, the structural homology between the endonuclease domain of the monomeric PI-SceI (18Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Google Scholar) and the homodimer of I-CreI (19Jurica M.S. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 469-476Google Scholar, 20Heath P.J. Stephens K.M. Monnat Jr., R.J. Stoddard B.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 468-476Google Scholar), a dodecapeptide homing endonuclease encoded by a self-splicing intron, is high. Whereas Christ and collaborators (21Christ F. Schoettler S. Wende W. Steuer S. Pingoud A. Pingoud V. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6908-6916Google Scholar) clearly defined the catalytic residues of PI-SceI, which are implied in the two active centers that specifically cleave each DNA strand of the substrate, this hypothesis remains to be explored for DNA cleavage by other inteins. To address this critical issue, we further studied the mechanism of DNA cleavage by PI-TfuI, an intein endonuclease from the DNA polymerase of Thermococcus fumicolans (GenBankTMaccession number Z69882). A previous study (6Saves I. Ozanne V. Dietrich J. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2335-2341Google Scholar) showed that PI-TfuI recognizes and cleaves a minimal sequence of 16 bp on supercoiled DNA with either Mn2+ or Mg2+ions as a cofactor but the enzyme is 5–10-fold more active in the presence of Mn2+ ions. Otherwise, it cleaves linear DNA only in the presence of Mn2+ ions and requires a 19-bp minimal recognition sequence. Hence, the cleavage efficiency and/or specificity of PI-TfuI depend on both the substrate topology and the divalent cation cofactor. By contrast with PI-SceI, an open circular nicked DNA is observed over the cleavage of supercoiled DNA by PI-TfuI (6Saves I. Ozanne V. Dietrich J. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2335-2341Google Scholar). That suggests a two-step cleavage of the DNA, giving support to the existence of two distinct active sites in the endonuclease domain of the archaeal intein. In the first part of this study, we characterized the nicked DNA as an intermediate of the double-stranded DNA cleavage reaction. We then set up a new method of analysis of the DNA cleavage using MALDI-TOF 1The abbreviations used are: MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; BM, bottom modified; TM, top modified; WT, wild type. mass spectrometry. This technology had already been applied to the analysis of nucleic acids (22Langley G.J. Herniman J.M. Davies N.L. Brown T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 1717-1723Google Scholar, 23Jurinke C. Zollner B. Feucht H.H. van den Boom D. Jacob A. Polywka S. Laufs R. Koster H. Genet. Anal. 1998; 14: 97-102Google Scholar) when searching for single nucleotide polymorphism in DNA sequences (24Stoerker J. Mayo J.D. Tetzlaff C.N. Sarracino D.A. Schwope I. Richert C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1213-1216Google Scholar), when sequencing DNA (25Nordhoff E. Luebbert C. Thiele G. Heiser V. Lehrach H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E86Google Scholar) or RNA (26Tolson D.A. Nicholson N.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 446-451Google Scholar), and also when characterizing DNA fragments generated by a nucleasic cleavage (27Chiu N.H. Tang K. Yip P. Braun A. Koster H. Cantor C.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E31Google Scholar,28Wada Y. J. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 33: 187-192Google Scholar). Here, the approach using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was optimized for the detection of small amounts of the DNA fragments typically generated by the intein cleavage in saline buffers, allowing the detection of less than 250 fmol of oligonucleotides produced by the enzymatic reaction. Finally, using this methodology, we demonstrated that the cleavage of DNA by PI-TfuI does indeed result from two independent reactions of cleavage. The recombinant intein was expressed in Escherichia coli, as previously described, after transformation of BL21(De3)(pLys-S) bacteria with the inducible expression vector pET26-Tfu1. The purification procedure was unchanged from that previously described (6Saves I. Ozanne V. Dietrich J. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2335-2341Google Scholar) and homogeneous fractions of PI-TfuI were obtained after a single step of anion exchange chromatography. These fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm NaCl, for storage. Previously described plasmids S1 and S4 (6Saves I. Ozanne V. Dietrich J. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2335-2341Google Scholar), containing, respectively, the 41-bp spanning the Pol-α homing site or the 16 bp constituting the minimal recognition and cleavage site of PI-TfuI, were used. The supercoiled form of these plasmids or the open circular intermediate of the cleavage were purified from a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA) using the Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen) and were diluted in water to a concentration of 100 ng/μl (56 fmol/μl). Endonuclease assays using these substrates were performed in a final volume of 10 μl, in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, buffer containing 100 mmNH4OAc and 25 mm MnSO4 or different concentrations of Mg(OAc)2, at 70 °C. The reaction mixtures were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel in TBE buffer. The amount of undigested substrates and products were quantified with the ImageQUANT program (Amersham Biosciences). Three different oligonucleotide duplexes, named WT, TM, and BM (Fig.1), were generated by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides P1 and P2, P1-mod and P2, and P1 and P2-mod, respectively, through boiling a mixture of 1 nmol of each oligonucleotide in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, for 5 min and slow cooling to room temperature. The sequences of these oligonucleotides are indicated in Table I. The first duplex (WT) contains the wild type 40 bp spanning the Pol-α site cleaved by the intein, whereas the two others contain a phosphorothioate bond in place of the scissible phosphodiester bond either in the top strand (TM) or the bottom strand (BM). 50 pmol of duplex were incubated with PI-TfuI in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8, containing 100 mmNH4OAc and 25 mm MnSO4 or 50 mm Mg(OAc)2 at 70 °C for different incubation times. These reaction mixtures were analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as indicated below.Table ICharacteristics of the oligonucleotides usedNameSizeSequenceTheorical M retExperimental M r [M+H]+mersMP1405′-TAGCTTATTTAGATTTTAGGTCGCTATATCCTTCGATTAT-3′12241.912243.4P2405′-ATAATCGAAGGATATAGCGACCTAAAATCTAAATAAGCTA-3′12332.112333.7P1-mod405′-TAGCTTATTTAGATTTTAGGTCGCTATATCCTTCGATTAT-3′12258.012259.6P2-mod405′-ATAATCGAAGGATATAGCGACCT*AAAATCTAAATAAGCTA-3′12348.112349.9F1215′-TAGCTTATTTAGATTTTAGGT-3′6454.16455.3F2195′-CGCTATATCCTTCGATTAT-3′5805.95807.1F3175′-AAAATCTAAATAAGCTA-3′5271.95273.1F4235′-ATAATCGAAGGATATAGCGACCT-3′7078.27079.5The asterisk indicates the phosphorothioate bond. Open table in a new tab The asterisk indicates the phosphorothioate bond. Four oligonucleotides, F1 to F4 (Isoprim, France), whose sequences are shown in Table I, were used to optimize the MALDI-TOF analysis conditions and to calibrate the analyzer in the positive linear mode. The lyophilized oligonucleotides were dissolved in 50 mm ammonium acetate at different concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 μm. The desalting procedure was adapted from the Langley's procedure (22Langley G.J. Herniman J.M. Davies N.L. Brown T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 1717-1723Google Scholar) to lower the MALDI-TOF detection limit. One μl of oligonucleotide sample was desalted by mixing with NH 4+-loaded ion exchange 200–400 mesh AG 50W-X8 beads (DowexTM, Bio-Rad) for 15 min at room temperature and 0.5 μl of the desalted solutions (25–250 fmol of calibrating oligonucleotides) were directly loaded on the sample plate together with an equal volume of matrix using the dried droplet method. The matrix used was a saturated solution of 3HPA (Aldrich Chemical Co.) in H2O/CH3CN (1/1, v/v) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (Sigma). The desalting procedure was subsequently optimized for the analysis of the cleavage reactions. First, the digested duplexes were precipitated using precipitator TM (Q.BIOgene, Illkirch, France), rinsed with acetone, dried, and resuspended in 5 μl of deionized water. 2.5 μl of these suspensions were then desalted by incubation with the NH 4+-loaded Dowex beads for 15 min at room temperature. The mixtures of digested DNA and beads were lyophilized and resuspended in 25 μl of the matrix. Hence, 1 μl of the matrix containing DNA (∼1 pmol) was loaded on the sample plate for MALDI-TOF analysis. MALDI-TOF analyses were performed using a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with delayed extraction technology and a reflector. Ions formed by a pulsed UV laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm, Laser Science, Newton, MA) were accelerated through a voltage of 20 kV. Spectra were the average of 500 acquisitions from a single laser pulse (2Hz) and were collected in linear positive ion mode over mass ranges ranging from 4000 to 8000 m/z or 8,000 to 15,000 m/z. Calibration of the spectra was performed using an external calibration with synthetic oligonucleotides F3 and F4. In our earlier examination of PI-TfuI endonuclease activity (6Saves I. Ozanne V. Dietrich J. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2335-2341Google Scholar), an open circular form of the DNA substrate was observed during the cleavage of supercoiled DNA into linear DNA. A kinetic analysis of the cleavage of the supercoiled substrate S1 containing the 41 bp spanning the intein insertion site was undertaken to determine whether this open circular DNA is an unspecific product of the reaction or a long-lived intermediate of the specific cleavage. Fig. 2 A shows the electrophoretic separation of the different forms of plasmid S1 that was incubated with PI-TfuI in the presence of 25 mm MnSO4, at 70 °C. The amount of each DNA form after different incubation times was quantified (Fig.2 B). In the presence of Mn2+ ions, the amount of open circular DNA increased during the first 8 min of the reaction and then progressively decreased, whereas the quantity of linear DNA (lin) was increased. The time courses of disappearance of supercoiled DNA and of appearance of linear DNA were fit to two exponentials using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA) to estimate the half-life of reaction. The rate of disappearance of the supercoiled substrate was thus estimated to be around 0.2 min−1(half-life of 5.3 min) and the rate of appearance of the linear product was estimated around 0.06 min−1 (half-life of 16.5 min). A similar kinetic analysis of supercoiled DNA cleavage was performed in the same buffer containing 50 mm Mg(OAc)2instead of MnSO4. As before, the supercoiled plasmid S1 was rapidly nicked into an open circular DNA (Fig. 2 C), the rate of disappearance of the supercoiled DNA being at least equivalent to the rate in the presence of Mn2+ (0.2 min−1). However, in the presence of Mg2+ ions, the open circular intermediate was rather stable and linear DNA appeared only very slowly (Fig. 2 D), its rate of appearance being estimated around 0.01 to 0.02 min−1 (half-life superior to 50 min). The stability of the open circular intermediate was observed independently of the Mg(OAc)2 concentration in the reaction buffer (data not shown). Moreover, a shifted DNA form, probably consisting of a complex between open circular DNA and the intein, was observed. To compare the efficiencies of supercoiled DNA nicking by PI-TfuI in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions, additional cleavage assays were performed using a lower amount of enzyme in the reaction mixture. As shown in Fig.3 A, around 80% of the supercoiled substrate had disappeared after 20 min of reaction in both buffers, meaning that the nicking activity is not dependent on the metal ion cofactor. Consistently with data in Fig. 2, B andD, the amount of linear DNA produced was ∼3-fold lower in the presence of magnesium ions. These preliminary results suggest that the open circular DNA is an intermediate of the cleavage reaction that is produced independently in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions and is subsequently cleaved into linear DNA preferentially in the presence of Mn2+ ions. Considering this hypothesis, we purified the open circular DNA formed during the reaction and submitted it to cleavage assays by PI-TfuI in the buffer containing 25 mm MnSO4 or 50 mmMg(OAc)2 (Fig 3 B). As expected, this open circular DNA was a good substrate of the enzyme in the presence of Mn2+ ions because it was readily processed into DNA cleaved on both strands, but was very slowly converted into linear DNA in the presence of Mg2+ ions. Moreover, the amounts of linear DNA produced in both conditions were similar to those obtained when supercoiled DNA was used as substrate of the cleavage reaction (Fig.3 A). These observations reinforce the hypothesis of a two-step cleavage including a nonlimiting first step of DNA nicking. Identical observations were made when the plasmid S4, containing the minimal 16-bp recognition and cleavage sequence, was used as substrate of PI-TfuI (not shown). Whatever the size of the target sequence, linear DNA was obtained after the incubation at 70 °C of the supercoiled DNA with PI-TfuI in the presence of 10–100 mm MnSO4, whereas accumulation of nicked plasmid was observed in the buffer containing 10–100 mm Mg(OAc)2. To go further in the characterization of the open circular intermediate of the reaction and in particular to determine whether one of the DNA strands is preferentially nicked in the first stage of the reaction, we developed a strategy to analyze the process of DNA cleavage using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. One critical step was the desalting of the oligonucleotides, the sensitivity of the analysis being mostly dependent on the efficiency of this particular process. Four synthetic oligonucleotides, F1 to F4, were used to optimize the DNA detection limits. Their sequences, shown in TableI, were chosen on the basis of the PI-TfuI cleavage site (6Saves I. Ozanne V. Dietrich J. Masson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2335-2341Google Scholar) meaning that these oligonucleotides are identical to the ones generated by the cleavage of the oligonucleotide duplex WT, a synthetic double-stranded substrate of PI-TfuI (Fig. 1). Among the various desalting procedures assayed, a variant of the procedure proposed by Langley and collaborators (22Langley G.J. Herniman J.M. Davies N.L. Brown T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 1717-1723Google Scholar) resulted in the lowest detection limits. The oligonucleotides were incubated with NH 4+-loaded Dowex beads, whereas Langley used H+-loaded Dowex beads for the desalting process previous to the MALDI-TOF analyses. Analyses of various amounts of each of the four synthetic oligonucleotides showed that the total ion current decreases when the length of the oligonucleotide increases. Despite that, as little as 25 fmol of the 23-mer oligonucleotide F4 could be detected with a signal/noise of 3 (Fig.4 A), whereas Langley's (22Langley G.J. Herniman J.M. Davies N.L. Brown T. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 13: 1717-1723Google Scholar) detection limit was reached with 5 pmol of 20-mer oligonucleotides. The measured masses of these oligonucleotides, under the protonated form, were in good agreement with the masses expected from their nucleotide sequences, differences between measured and expected masses being less than 0.5 Da (Table I). The analysis, in the same conditions, of an equimolar mixture of the four oligonucleotides showed that the detection limit of each oligonucleotide present in the mixture was higher than the detection limit of each oligonucleotide analyzed individually (Fig.4 B). Consequently, because the total ion current obtained for each oligonucleotide is dependent on oligonucleotide length, the detection limit of the smallest oligonucleotide F3 remains around 25 fmol, whereas that of the oligonucleotide F4 is 250 fmol in the presence of the other oligonucleotides. The WT DNA substrate of PI-TfuI was obtained by annealing the complementary oligonucleotides P1 and P2 (Table I). This double-stranded DNA (Fig. 1) corresponds to the 40-bp sequence spanning the intein insertion site in T. fumicolans genome, which is the target of the specific endonuclease PI-TfuI. Each of the 40-mer oligonucleotides P1 and P2 were independently analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 4, C and D). It is noteworthy that the resolution of the two oligonucleotides peaks was rather low compared with that of oligonucleotides F1 to F4. This decrease in resolution may be explained by a poor desalting efficiency because of the size of these oligonucleotides because the analyses of P1 and P2 gave similar signals. Nevertheless, for both oligonucleotides, as little as 250 fmol were detected with a signal/noise of 4 and the measured masses corresponded to the calculated masses within 1 Da (Table I). By contrast, the analysis of the oligonucleotide duplex formed by the hybridization of P1 and P2 in the intein reaction buffer highlighted that the ion current observed for oligonucleotide P2 was 3 times higher than that of P1, suggesting that P2 may be more efficiently desalted than P1 in the buffered solution (Fig. 4 E). One likely explanation, based on the observations of Gross and collaborators (29Gross J. Hillenkamp F. Wan K.X. Gross M.L. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2001; 12: 180-192Google Scholar), is that the affinity of the oligonucleotides for NH 4+ ions and, as a consequence, the desalting efficiencies of these oligonucleotides, when in competition, are dependent on the nucleotide sequence. Further modifications of the desalting procedure were then pursued to improve the DNA detection limits in the reaction buffer. Hence, a precipitation step with acetone was added, DNA was then resuspended in water, incubated with NH 4+-loaded ion exchange beads, and lyophilized in the presence of the beads. The matrix was directly added to the dried DNA mixture to be analyzed. This desalting procedure allowed us to detect less than 100 fmol of the cleavage fragments in the buffer containing 200 mm salts with a signal/noise superior to 3. The resolution of the two 40-bp parent oligonucleotides remained low so that it was not possible to follow the disappearance of each DNA strand during the reaction. The analysis of the duplex cleavage by the intein PI-TfuI was thus restricted to the mass range of the cleavage products,i.e. to m/z from 4,000 to 8,000. Fifty pmol of the WT duplex DNA were used as a substrate in digestion reactions and 1 pmol of digested DNA was analyzed by MALDI-TOF after desalting. The cleavage fragments generated by the incubation of the double-stranded DNA substrate with a large amount of PI-TfuI, at 70 °C in the optimal reaction buffer containing 25 mm MnSO4, were analyzed at various time points from 0 to 60 min of reaction. As expected, no cleavage fragment was detected when the reaction had not yet begun (Fig. 5 A). After 60 min of reaction, 4 peaks corresponding to the 4 generated fragments were detected (Fig. 5 F), showing that, as expected, the site of cleavage of each strand is unique. Moreover, the measured masses for these fragments are in agreement with the previously proposed cleavage site of PI-TfuI indicated in Fig. 1. MALDI-TOF analyses at intermediary times of reaction revealed that the four products of the reaction did not appear simultaneously in the reaction mixture. The two fragments generated by the cleavage of P2 and corresponding to the sequence of the controls F3 and F4 were clearly detected after 2 min of reaction (Fig. 5 B), whereas the two fragments generated by the cleavage of P1 and corresponding to the sequence of oligonucleotides F1 and F2 were only weakly observed after 5 min of reaction (Fig. 5 C). Analyses at longer reaction times showed that each fragment pair progressively appeared at different rates in the digestion mixture (Fig. 5, D–F), the cleavage of oligonucleotide P2 being faster than that of P1. These results demonstrated that the bottom strand of the DNA substrate is more rapidly cleaved by PI-TfuI than the top strand. Based on the variation of the absolute peak intensities observed on the mass spectra, the amount of fragments generated by the cleavage of oligonucleotide P2 (Fig. 5) may be considered as constant after 15 min of reaction, indicating that the cleavage of the P2 oligonucleotide was then complete, whereas the cleavage of P1 appeared to be complete after 60 min of reaction. The rate of cleavage of the top strand can thus be considered to be roughly 4-fold lower than the rate of cleavage of the bottom strand. A similar kinetic analysis was performed in the same buffer but in the presence of 50 mm Mg(OAc)2 instead of 25 mmMnSO4. Here again, the fragments corresponding to the cleavage of P2 oligonucleotide were rapidly generated (Fig.6 A). The fragments corresponding to the cleavage of P1, however, were only weakly detected after 60 min of reaction (Fig. 6"
