https://openalex.org/W1429299901,"Metamaterial-based optical cloaks have thus far used volumetric distribution of the material properties to gradually bend light and thereby obscure the cloaked region. Hence, they are bulky and hard to scale up and, more critically, typical carpet cloaks introduce unnecessary phase shifts in the reflected light, making the cloaks detectable. Here, we demonstrate experimentally an ultrathin invisibility skin cloak wrapped over an object. This skin cloak conceals a three-dimensional arbitrarily shaped object by complete restoration of the phase of the reflected light at 730-nanometer wavelength. The skin cloak comprises a metasurface with distributed phase shifts rerouting light and rendering the object invisible. In contrast to bulky cloaks with volumetric index variation, our device is only 80 nanometer (about one-ninth of the wavelength) thick and potentially scalable for hiding macroscopic objects."
https://openalex.org/W2265362920,"Over the past several decades, organometallic cross-coupling chemistry has developed into one of the most reliable approaches to assemble complex aromatic compounds from preoxidized starting materials. More recently, transition metal-catalyzed carbon-hydrogen activation has circumvented the need for preoxidized starting materials, but this approach is limited by a lack of practical amination protocols. Here, we present a blueprint for aromatic carbon-hydrogen functionalization via photoredox catalysis and describe the utility of this strategy for arene amination. An organic photoredox-based catalyst system, consisting of an acridinium photooxidant and a nitroxyl radical, promotes site-selective amination of a variety of simple and complex aromatics with heteroaromatic azoles of interest in pharmaceutical research. We also describe the atom-economical use of ammonia to form anilines, without the need for prefunctionalization of the aromatic component."
https://openalex.org/W1701091641,"Prostate cancer is initially responsive to androgen deprivation, but the effectiveness of androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors in recurrent disease is variable. Biopsy of bone metastases is challenging; hence, sampling circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may reveal drug-resistance mechanisms. We established single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) profiles of 77 intact CTCs isolated from 13 patients (mean six CTCs per patient), by using microfluidic enrichment. Single CTCs from each individual display considerable heterogeneity, including expression of AR gene mutations and splicing variants. Retrospective analysis of CTCs from patients progressing under treatment with an AR inhibitor, compared with untreated cases, indicates activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling (P = 0.0064). Ectopic expression of Wnt5a in prostate cancer cells attenuates the antiproliferative effect of AR inhibition, whereas its suppression in drug-resistant cells restores partial sensitivity, a correlation also evident in an established mouse model. Thus, single-cell analysis of prostate CTCs reveals heterogeneity in signaling pathways that could contribute to treatment failure."

Fumagalli et al. have found signs of selection for genetic variants in fat metabolism, not just for promoting heat-producing brown fat cells but also for coping with the large amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids found in their seafood diet (see the Perspective by Tishkoff). Genes under selection in these populations have a strong effect on height and weight of up to 2 cm and 4 kg, respectively, as well as a protective effect on cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

https://openalex.org/W1913451947,"The enhancement of the functional properties of materials at reduced dimensions is crucial for continuous advancements in nanoelectronic applications. Here, we report that the scale reduction leads to the emergence of an important functional property, ferroelectricity, challenging the long-standing notion that ferroelectricity is inevitably suppressed at the scale of a few nanometers. A combination of theoretical calculations, electrical measurements, and structural analyses provides evidence of room-temperature ferroelectricity in strain-free epitaxial nanometer-thick films of otherwise nonferroelectric strontium titanate (SrTiO3). We show that electrically induced alignment of naturally existing polar nanoregions is responsible for the appearance of a stable net ferroelectric polarization in these films. This finding can be useful for the development of low-dimensional material systems with enhanced functional properties relevant to emerging nanoelectronic devices."

For a few, subsequent infection results in lethal hemorrhagic disease. Katzelnick et al. used antibody-binding data to map structural divergence and antigenic variation among dengue viruses. Comparing results in monkeys and humans, the viruses approximately clustered into the four known groups. However, the four virus groups showed as much antigenic distance within a group as between groups. This finding helps explain why immune responses to dengue are highly variable, and it has complex implications for epidemiology, disease, and vaccine deployment. Science , this issue p. 1338"

Moore et al. observed that dividing neural stem cells in rodents establish a diffusion barrier that restricts damaged proteins to one daughter cell, leaving the other with intact molecules. But with age this diffusion barrier weakens, so that replicating stem cells of older animals are less able to exclude damaged proteins than are the stem cells of younger rodents.

https://openalex.org/W2283059525,"Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway occurs in a variety of cancers and often correlates with a poor prognosis. To further explore the potential role of Hippo pathway dysregulation in tumor development and progression, we investigated its downstream transcription factor TEAD4 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Increased expression and nuclear localization of TEAD4 were found in a significant portion of CRC tissues, in association with metastasis and a poor prognosis. In CRC cells, TEAD4 knockdown induced the mesenchymal–epithelial transition and decreased cell mobility in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Microarray analysis revealed that TEAD4 promoted cell adhesion and upregulated the epithelial–mesenchymal transition-related transcriptome in CRC cells. Vimentin was identified as a new direct target gene mediating TEAD4 function in CRC cells, whereby forced vimentin expression markedly reversed TEAD4-knockdown-induced cell morphological changes and decreased mobility. Interestingly, rescued expression of both WT TEAD4 and a Y429H mutant can reverse the mesenchymal–epithelial transition and increase vimentin expression, cell mobility and metastatic potential in TEAD4-knockdown CRC cells. The discrepant expression of YAP and TEAD4 in CRC tissues, the rescue ability of TEAD4 mutant defect in YAP binding and no effect on vimentin expression by YAP knockdown in CRC cells, all implicated a YAP-independent manner of TEAD4 function in CRC. Furthermore, vimentin positively correlated and CDH1 reversely correlated with the level of TEAD4 in CRC tissues and xenograft tumors. Our results suggest that TEAD4 nuclear expression can serve as a biomarker for CRC progression and poor prognosis. The transcription factor TEAD4 regulates a pro-metastasis transcription program in a YAP-independent manner in CRC, thus providing a novel mechanism of TEAD4 transcriptional regulation and its oncogenic role in CRC, independently of the Hippo pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2239632319,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of constitutive activity among orphan class-A G protein coupled receptors within the cAMP signaling pathway. Constitutive signaling was revealed by changes in gene expression under control of the cAMP response element. Gene expression was measured in Chinese hamster ovary cells transiently co-transfected with plasmids containing a luciferase reporter and orphan receptor. Criteria adopted for defining constitutive activation were: 1) 200% elevation over baseline reporter gene expression; 2) 40% inhibition of baseline expression; and 3) 40% inhibition of expression stimulated by 3 μM forskolin. Five patterns of activity were noted: 1) inhibition under both baseline and forskolin stimulated expression (GPR15, GPR17, GPR18, GPR20, GPR25, GPR27, GPR31, GPR32, GPR45, GPR57, GPR68, GPR83, GPR84, GPR132, GPR150, GPR176); 2) no effect on baseline expression, but inhibition of forskolin stimulated expression (GPR4, GPR26, GPR61, GPR62, GPR78, GPR101, GPR119); 3) elevation of baseline signaling coupled with inhibition of forskolin stimulated expression (GPR6, GPR12); 4) elevation of baseline signaling without inhibition of forskolin stimulated expression (GPR3, GPR21, GPR52, GPR65); and 5) no effect on expression (GPR1, GPR19, GPR22, GPR34, GPR35, GPR39, GPR63, GPR82, GPR85, GPR87). Constitutive activity was observed in 75% of the orphan class-A receptors examined (30 of 40). This constitutive signaling cannot be explained by simple overexpression of the receptor. Inhibition of cAMP mediated expression was far more common (65%) than stimulation of expression (15%). Orphan receptors that were closely related based on amino acid homology tended to have similar effects on gene expression. These results suggest that identification of inverse agonists may be a fruitful approach for categorizing these orphan receptors and targeting them for pharmacological intervention."

https://openalex.org/W3098761336,"Multiparticle entangled quantum states, a key resource in quantum-enhanced metrology and computing, are usually generated by coherent operations exclusively. However, unusual forms of quantum dynamics can be obtained when environment coupling is used as part of the state generation. In this work, we used quantum Zeno dynamics (QZD), based on nondestructive measurement with an optical microcavity, to deterministically generate different multiparticle entangled states in an ensemble of 36 qubit atoms in less than 5 microseconds. We characterized the resulting states by performing quantum tomography, yielding a time-resolved account of the entanglement generation. In addition, we studied the dependence of quantum states on measurement strength and quantified the depth of entanglement. Our results show that QZD is a versatile tool for fast and deterministic entanglement generation in quantum engineering applications."
https://openalex.org/W2217032169,"Previously, it has been shown that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) tumors exhibit high levels of hypoxia, characterized by low oxygen pressure (pO2) and decreased O2 intracellular perfusion. Chronic hypoxia is strongly associated with resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy and chemoradiation in an understudied phenomenon known as hypoxia-induced chemoresistance. The hypoxia-inducible, pro-oncogenic, serine-threonine kinase PIM1 (Proviral Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1) has emerged as a key regulator of hypoxia-induced chemoresistance in PDA and other cancers. Although its role in therapeutic resistance has been described previously, the molecular mechanism behind PIM1 overexpression in PDA is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that cis-acting AU-rich elements (ARE) present within a 38-base pair region of the PIM1 mRNA 3'-untranslated region mediate a regulatory interaction with the mRNA stability factor HuR (Hu antigen R) in the context of tumor hypoxia. Predominantly expressed in the nucleus in PDA cells, HuR translocates to the cytoplasm in response to hypoxic stress and stabilizes the PIM1 mRNA transcript, resulting in PIM1 protein overexpression. A reverse-phase protein array revealed that HuR-mediated regulation of PIM1 protects cells from hypoxic stress through phosphorylation and inactivation of the apoptotic effector BAD and activation of MEK1/2. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of HuR by MS-444 inhibits HuR homodimerization and its cytoplasmic translocation, abrogates hypoxia-induced PIM1 overexpression and markedly enhances PDA cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil under physiologic low oxygen conditions. Taken together, these results support the notion that HuR has prosurvival properties in PDA cells by enabling them with growth advantages in stressful tumor microenvironment niches. Accordingly, these studies provide evidence that therapeutic disruption of HuR's regulation of PIM1 may be a key strategy in breaking an elusive chemotherapeutic resistance mechanism acquired by PDA cells that reside in hypoxic PDA microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2266481176,"A wide variety of RNAs encode small open-reading-frame (smORF/sORF) peptides, but their functions are largely unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila polished-rice (pri) sORF peptides trigger proteasome-mediated protein processing, converting the Shavenbaby (Svb) transcription repressor into a shorter activator. A genome-wide RNA interference screen identifies an E2-E3 ubiquitin-conjugating complex, UbcD6-Ubr3, which targets Svb to the proteasome in a pri-dependent manner. Upon interaction with Ubr3, Pri peptides promote the binding of Ubr3 to Svb. Ubr3 can then ubiquitinate the Svb N terminus, which is degraded by the proteasome. The C-terminal domains protect Svb from complete degradation and ensure appropriate processing. Our data show that Pri peptides control selectivity of Ubr3 binding, which suggests that the family of sORF peptides may contain an extended repertoire of protein regulators."
https://openalex.org/W1916299706,"The social welfare provided by cooperation depends on the enforcement of social norms. Determining blameworthiness and assigning a deserved punishment are two cognitive cornerstones of norm enforcement. Although prior work has implicated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in norm-based judgments, the relative contribution of this region to blameworthiness and punishment decisions remains poorly understood. Here, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and fMRI to determine the specific role of DLPFC function in norm-enforcement behavior. DLPFC rTMS reduced punishment for wrongful acts without affecting blameworthiness ratings, and fMRI revealed punishment-selective DLPFC recruitment, suggesting that these two facets of norm-based decision making are neurobiologically dissociable. Finally, we show that DLPFC rTMS affects punishment decision making by altering the integration of information about culpability and harm. Together, these findings reveal a selective, causal role for DLPFC in norm enforcement: representational integration of the distinct information streams used to make punishment decisions."

Here we report the structures of RdRps and associated RNAs within nontranscribing and transcribing cypoviruses (NCPV and TCPV, respectively), using a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and a symmetry-mismatch reconstruction method. The RdRps and associated RNAs appear to exhibit a pseudo-D3 symmetric organization in both NCPV and TCPV. However, the molecular interactions between RdRps and the genomic RNA were found to differ in these states. Our work provides insight into the mechanisms of the replication and transcription in dsRNA viruses and paves a way for structural determination of lower-symmetry complexes enclosed in higher-symmetry structures."

Understanding such processes requires spatially and temporally resolved observations and experimental controls that precisely manipulate the interfacial thermodynamic state. Using the intense radiation fields of a focused synchrotron x-ray beam, we drove dissolution at the calcite/water interface and simultaneously probed the dynamics of the propagating reaction fronts using surface x-ray microscopy. Evolving surface structures were controlled by the time-dependent solution composition, as characterized by a kinetic reaction model. At extreme disequilibria, we observed the onset of reaction front instabilities with velocities of > 30 nanometers per second. These instabilities serve as a signature of transport-limited dissolution of calcite under extreme disequilibrium."
https://openalex.org/W2263792530,"NAD is essential for cellular metabolism and has a key role in various signaling pathways in human cells. To ensure proper control of vital reactions, NAD must be permanently resynthesized. Nicotinamide and nicotinic acid as well as nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinic acid riboside (NAR) are the major precursors for NAD biosynthesis in humans. In this study, we explored whether the ribosides NR and NAR can be generated in human cells. We demonstrate that purified, recombinant human cytosolic 5′-nucleotidases (5′-NTs) CN-II and CN-III, but not CN-IA, can dephosphorylate the mononucleotides nicotinamide mononucleotide and nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) and thus catalyze NR and NAR formation in vitro. Similar to their counterpart from yeast, Sdt1, the human 5′-NTs require high (millimolar) concentrations of nicotinamide mononucleotide or NAMN for efficient catalysis. Overexpression of FLAG-tagged CN-II and CN-III in HEK293 and HepG2 cells resulted in the formation and release of NAR. However, NAR accumulation in the culture medium of these cells was only detectable under conditions that led to increased NAMN production from nicotinic acid. The amount of NAR released from cells engineered for increased NAMN production was sufficient to maintain viability of surrounding cells unable to use any other NAD precursor. Moreover, we found that untransfected HeLa cells produce and release sufficient amounts of NAR and NR under normal culture conditions. Collectively, our results indicate that cytosolic 5′-NTs participate in the conversion of NAD precursors and establish NR and NAR as integral constituents of human NAD metabolism. In addition, they point to the possibility that different cell types might facilitate each other's NAD supply by providing alternative precursors.

Several commercial kits for the diagnosis of dengue are existing, but concerns have arisen regarding to the affordability and performance characteristics of these kits. Hence, the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is potentially ideal to be used especially in resource limited environments. Serum was collected from healthy donors and patients diagnosed with dengue infection. RNA extracted from the serum samples were tested by reverse-transcription-LAMP assay developed based on 3'-NCR gene sequences for DENV 1-4. Results were interpreted by a turbidity meter in real time or visually at the end of the assay. Sensitivity and specificity of RT-LAMP results were calculated and compared to qRT-PCR and ELISA. RT-LAMP is highly sensitive with the detection limit of 10 RNA copies for all serotypes. Dengue virus RNA was detected in all positive samples using RT-LAMP and none of the negative samples within 30-45 minutes. With continuing efforts in the optimization of this assay, RT-LAMP may provide a simple and reliable test for detecting DENV in areas where dengue is prevalent."

Klotho levels were assessed in the lung samples and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of non-smokers, smokers, and patients with COPD. The regulation of Klotho expression by cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was studied in vitro, and small interfering RNA (siRNA) and recombinant Klotho were employed to investigate the role of Klotho on CSE-induced inflammation.

Knockdown of endogenous Klotho augmented the expression of the inflammatory mediators, such as MMP-9, IL-6, and TNF-α, by MH-S cells. Exogenous Klotho inhibited the expression of CSE-induced inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, we showed that Klotho interacts with IκBα of the NF-κB pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2227717222,"MOF (MYST1, KAT8) is the major H4K16 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) in Drosophila and mammals and is essential for embryonic development. However, little is known regarding the role of MOF in specific cell lineages. Here we analyze the differential role of MOF in proliferating and terminally differentiated tissues at steady state and under stress conditions. In proliferating cells, MOF directly binds and maintains the expression of genes required for cell cycle progression. In contrast, MOF is dispensable for terminally differentiated, postmitotic glomerular podocytes under physiological conditions. However, in response to injury, MOF is absolutely critical for podocyte maintenance in vivo. Consistently, we detect defective nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi structures, as well as presence of multivesicular bodies in vivo in podocytes lacking Mof following injury. Undertaking genome-wide expression analysis of podocytes, we uncover several MOF-regulated pathways required for stress response. We find that MOF, along with the members of the non-specific lethal but not the male-specific lethal complex, directly binds to genes encoding the lysosome, endocytosis and vacuole pathways, which are known regulators of podocyte maintenance. Thus, our work identifies MOF as a key regulator of cellular stress response in glomerular podocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2475324019,"The canonical Wnt pathway (TCF4/β-catenin) has important roles during normal differentiation and in disease. Some Wnt functions depend on signaling gradients requiring the pathway to be tightly regulated. A key Wnt target is the transcription factor ZEB1 whose expression by cancer cells promotes tumor invasiveness by repressing the expression of epithelial specification markers and activating mesenchymal genes, including a number of Wnt targets such as LAMC2 and uPA. The ability of ZEB1 to activate/repress its target genes depends on its recruitment of corepressors (CtBP, BRG1) or coactivators (p300) although conditions under which ZEB1 binds these cofactors are not elucidated. Here, we show that TCF4 and ZEB1 reciprocally modulate each other's transcriptional activity: ZEB1 enhances TCF4/β-catenin-mediated transcription and, in turn, Wnt signaling switches ZEB1 from a repressor into an activator. In colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with active Wnt signaling, ZEB1 enhances transcriptional activation of LAMC2 and uPA by TCF4/β-catenin. However, in CRC cells with inactive Wnt, ZEB1 represses both genes. Reciprocal modulation of ZEB1 and TCF4 activities involves their binding to DNA and mutual interaction. Wnt signaling turns ZEB1 into an activator by replacing binding of CtBP/BRG1 in favor of p300. Using a mouse model of Wnt-induced intestinal tumorigenesis, we found that downregulation of ZEB1 reduces the expression of LAMC2 in vivo. These results identify a mechanism through which Wnt and ZEB1 transcriptional activities are modulated, offering new approaches in cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2213492263,"Melanoma dedifferentiation, characterized by the loss of MITF and MITF regulated genes and by upregulation of stemness markers as CD271, is implicated in resistance to chemotherapy, target therapy and immunotherapy. The identification of intrinsic mechanisms fostering melanoma dedifferentiation may provide actionable therapeutic targets to improve current treatments. Here, we identify NFATc2 transcription factor as an intrinsic regulator of human melanoma dedifferentiation. In panels of melanoma cell lines, NFATc2 expression correlated inversely with MITF at both mRNA and protein levels. NFATc2(+/Hi) melanoma cell lines were CD271(+) and deficient for expression of melanocyte differentiation antigens (MDAs) MART-1, gp100, tyrosinase and of GPNMB, PGC1-α and Rab27a, all regulated by MITF. Targeting of NFATc2 by small interfering RNA, short hairpin RNA and by an NFATc2 inhibitor upregulated MITF, MDAs, GPNMB, PGC-1α, tyrosinase activity and pigmentation and suppressed CD271. Mechanistically, we found that NFATc2 controls melanoma dedifferentiation by inducing expression in neoplastic cells of membrane-bound tumor necrosis factor-α (mTNF-α) and that melanoma-expressed TNF-α regulates a c-myc-Brn2 axis. Specifically, NFATc2, mTNF-α and expression of TNF receptors were significantly correlated in panels of cell lines. NFATc2 silencing suppressed TNF-α expression, and neutralization of melanoma-expressed TNF-α promoted melanoma differentiation. Moreover, silencing of NFATc2 and TNF-α neutralization downmodulated c-myc and POU3F2/Brn2. Brn2 was strongly expressed in NFATc2(+/Hi) MITF(Lo) cell lines and its silencing upregulated MITF. Targeting of c-myc, by silencing or by a c-myc inhibitor, suppressed Brn2 and upregulated MITF and MART-1 in melanoma cells. The relevance of NFATc2-dependent melanoma dedifferentiation for immune escape was shown by cytolytic T-cell assays.

With each tumor, 10-15 regions of interest (ROIs) were manually placed on TP and PT area. ADC and permeability parameters (Ktrans, Ve, Kep and iAUC) were calculated and their diagnostic efficiency was assessed.In TP, all permeability parameters and ADC value could significantly discriminate Low- from High grade gliomas (HGG) (p<0.001); among theses parameters, Ve demonstrated the highest diagnostic power (iAUC: 0.79, cut-off point: 0.15); the most sensitive and specific index for gliomas grading were Ktrans (84%) and Kep (89%). While, in PT area, only Ktrans could help in gliomas grading (P = 0.009, cut-off point: 0.03 min-1). Moreover, in TP, mean Ve and iAUC of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and metastases were significantly higher than that in HGG (p<0.003). Further, in PT area, mean Ktrans (p≤0.004) could discriminate PCNSL from HGG and ADC (p≤0.003) could differentiate metastases with HGG.Quantitative ADC and permeability parameters from Diffusion and DCE-MR in TP and PT area, especially DCE-MR, can aid in gliomas grading and brain tumors discrimination. Their combined application is strongly recommended in the differential diagnosis of these tumor entities."
https://openalex.org/W2335807821,"Hyperglycemia in diabetic patients results in a diverse range of complications such as diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular diseases. The role of aldose reductase (AR), the key enzyme in the polyol pathway, in these complications is well established. Due to notable side-effects of several drugs, phytochemicals as an alternative has gained considerable importance for the treatment of several ailments. In order to evaluate the inhibitory effects of dietary spices on AR, a collection of phytochemicals were identified from Zingiber officinale (ginger), Curcuma longa (turmeric) Allium sativum (garlic) and Trigonella foenum graecum (fenugreek). Molecular docking was performed for lead identification and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the dynamic behaviour of these protein-ligand interactions. Gingerenones A, B and C, lariciresinol, quercetin and calebin A from these spices exhibited high docking score, binding affinity and sustained protein-ligand interactions. Rescoring of protein ligand interactions at the end of MD simulations produced binding scores that were better than the initially docked conformations. Docking results, ligand interactions and ADMET properties of these molecules were significantly better than commercially available AR inhibitors like epalrestat, sorbinil and ranirestat. Thus, these natural molecules could be potent AR inhibitors."

Currently, the interaction between MAVS and TRAF6 is only partially understood, and atomic details are lacking. Here, we demonstrated that MAVS directly interacts with TRAF6 through its potential TRAF6-binding motif 2 (T6BM2; amino acids 455–460). Further, we solved the crystal structure of MAVS T6BM2 in complex with the TRAF6 TRAF_C domain at 2.95 Å resolution. T6BM2 of MAVS binds to the canonical adaptor-binding groove of the TRAF_C domain. Structure-directed mutational analyses in vitro and in cells revealed that MAVS binding to TRAF6 via T6BM2 instead of T6BM1 is essential but not sufficient for an optimal antiviral response. Particularly, a MAVS mutant Y460E retained its TRAF6-binding ability as predicted but showed significantly impaired signaling activity, highlighting the functional importance of this tyrosine.

These TRAF proteins are E3 ligases that can activate downstream TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)/IκB kinase ϵ (IKKϵ) and IKKα/β, which in turn activate the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3/7 and NF-κB. Activated IRF3/7 and NF-κB translocate to the nucleus to induce the expression of type I interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. TRAF proteins act as crucial adaptors and E3 ligases in signal transduction important for immunity and development (28Wang Y. Zhang P. Liu Y. Cheng G.

U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8408-8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Most TRAF proteins possess an N-terminal RING finger domain followed by several zinc fingers. TRAF proteins display E3 ligases activity and mediate Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination to modulate functions of substrate molecules via their RING finger domains (39Häcker H. Tseng P.H. Karin M. Expanding TRAF function: TRAF3 as a tri-faced immune regulator.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2011; 11: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In Toll-like receptor and NOD-like receptor signaling, TRAF6 recruits and activates NF-κB essential modulator-IKKα/β and TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein 1/2/3-TAK1, resulting in the activation of NF-κB and AP-1, whereas TRAF3 recruits IKKα and TBK1/IKKϵ to facilitate IRF3/7 phosphorylation and activation, both of which depend on their E3 ligase activities and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination (29Xie P. TRAF molecules in cell signaling and in human diseases.J. Mol. Signal. 2013; 8: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The regulatory effect of TRAF proteins on RLR signaling is controversial. MAVS has three potential TIMs, named TRAF2/3-binding motif (T2/3BM, 143PVQDT147) and TRAF6-binding motifs 1 and 2 (T6BM1, 153PGENSE158; T6BM2, 455PEENEY460) (17Xu L.G. Wang Y.Y. Han K.J. Li L.Y. Zhai Z. Shu H.B. VISA is an adapter protein required for virus-triggered IFN-β signaling.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 727-740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). The T2/3BM and T6BM1 are located in the proline-rich region of MAVS, whereas the T6BM2 is adjacent to the transmembrane domain. A group of studies indicate that MAVS associates with TRAF2 and TRAF3 via T2/3BM and associates with TRAF6 via T6BM1/2 (16Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Chen Z.J.

Deletion or mutation of TIMs impairs the binding of MAVS with TRAF proteins and the activation of NF-κB and interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). Moreover, deletion of T6BM2 resulted in a stronger effect than did T2/3BM or T6BM1 deletion, suggesting that T6BM2 plays a more important role in MAVS-mediated antiviral function. However, the interaction between MAVS and TRAF6 has not been structurally characterized. Here, we identified the T6BM2 of MAVS, but not the T6BM1, as the primary binding site of TRAF6 and determined the crystal structure of T6BM2 in complex with the TRAF_C domain of TRAF6 to 2.95 Å resolution. Mutations on the interface that disrupt MAVS-TRAF6 complex assembly significantly impaired downstream antiviral signaling. Of particularly interest, a MAVS mutant, Y460E, which was designed to retain its TRAF6-binding ability, could indeed bind TRAF6 as does wild type MAVS but could no longer elicit an optimal antiviral response, indicating a critical role of tyrosine 460. Overall, our work provides a structural basis to further study MAVS-TRAF6 signaling. The TIMs of human MAVS, T2/3BM (amino acids 138–153), T6BM1 (amino acids 149–165), and T6BM2 (amino acids 449–467) were cloned into pET28a with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. The TRAF domain (amino acids 310–504) and TRAF_C domain (amino acids 346–504) of human TRAF6 were cloned into pET28a with an N-terminal maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag and a C-terminal His6 tag, respectively. All constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) CodonPlus cells. Protein expression was induced by 0.25 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 1.0 in Terrific Broth medium, and cells were cultured for an additional 18 h at 22 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) for GST- and MBP-tagged proteins or in lysis buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm imidazole) for His-tagged protein and lysed by a high pressure homogenizer (JNBIO3000 Plus) at 1,200 bars. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 40 min. The soluble fractions for GST-tagged MAVS TIMs were applied to glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm reduced glutathione. The soluble fraction for MBP-tagged TRAF6 TRAF domain was applied to amylose resin (New England Biolabs) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm maltose. The soluble fraction for His-tagged TRAF6 TRAF_C domain was applied to nickel-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer B, and the proteins were eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 300 mm imidazole. To obtain untagged TRAF6 TRAF domain, the MBP tag was removed by His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease and rebound to nickel-Sepharose to remove tobacco etch virus protease. Proteins were then concentrated and applied to a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 pg column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT for GST-tagged MAVS TIMs and with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT for His-tagged TRAF6 TRAF_C domain. Protein of MBP-tagged and untagged TRAF6 TRAF domain were further purified by HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 pg column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The purity of target proteins was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Proteins of MAVS mutants were expressed and purified as wild type GST-tagged MAVS TIMs. For cellular assays, FLAG-tagged full-length MAVS and TRAF6 were cloned into pcDNA3.1. MBP-tagged TRAF6 TRAF domain was coupled on amylose resin and then mixed with various versions of MAVS proteins at 4 °C for 2 h in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The resin was washed two times with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 20 mm maltose. The input and output samples were loaded to SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) was performed using Octet Red 96 (ForteBio) as described previously (40Shi Z. Jiao S. Zhang Z. Ma M. Zhang Z. Chen C. Wang K. Wang H. Wang W. Zhang L. Zhao Y. Zhou Z.

The TRAF6 TRAF domain was labeled by biotin in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT at 25 °C for 1 h. Biotinylated TRAF6 TRAF domain was immobilized on streptavidin (SA) biosensors and then incubated with different proteins of MAVS constructs in kinetics buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% BSA, and 0.001% Triton X-100). All binding experiments were performed at 25 °C. The experiments contained five steps: 1) baseline acquisition; 2) loading of biotinylated proteins onto SA biosensor; 3) second baseline acquisition; 4) association of interacting protein for kon measurement; and 5) dissociation of interacting protein for koff measurement. Data were analyzed using Octet Data Analysis software version 7.0 (ForteBio). Equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated by the ratio of koff to kon. For crystallization, the T6BM2 peptide (450GPCHGPEENEYKSEGTFGI468) of MAVS was synthesized (Scilight-Peptide, Beijing, China). Before crystallization, the protein of TRAF6 TRAF_C domain was incubated with the T6BM2 peptide of MAVS on ice for 1 h. Crystallization trials were carried out at 18 °C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method. The sitting drops consisted of 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution and were equilibrated against 100 μl of reservoir solution. Crystals appeared after several days in reservoir solution consisting of 6% (v/v) Tacsimate, pH 6.0, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000. The crystals were then soaked in a cryoprotection solution composed of 6% (v/v) Tacsimate, pH 6.0, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.0, 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 4000, and 10% glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected on beamline BL17U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and processed using HKL2000 (41Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

HEK293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin and transfected with IFNβ-Luc or ISRE-Luc and different constructs of FLAG-tagged MAVS or TRAF6. The expression of FLAG-tagged MAVS and TRAF6 was detected by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody (F3165, Sigma). Luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) and then calculated as the ratio of luciferase/Renilla activity. MAVS−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin and then electrotransfected with different constructs of FLAG-tagged MAVS and infected with Sendai virus (SeV). Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcripted to cDNAs, which were then used as template for a quantitative PCR assay. The quantitative PCR assay was performed on a CFX96TM real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). Real-time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) was used to detect and quantify the mRNA level of the target gene. GAPDH was used as an internal control. The primers used were as follows: mIFNβ, 5′-AGCTCCAAGAAAGGACGAACA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCCCTGTAGGTGAGGTTGAT-3′ (reverse); mGAPDH, 5′-TTGTCATGGGAGTGAACGAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGGCAGTTGGTGGTACAGG-3′ (reverse); MAVS, 5′-CAGGCCGAGCCTATCATCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGGCTTTGAGCTAGTTGGCA-3′ (reverse). To experimentally determine which of the three TIMs (T2/3BM, T6BM1, or T6BM2) in MAVS is the primary binding site of TRAF6, we constructed and purified these TIMs of MAVS with a GST tag and the TRAF domain of TRAF6 with a MBP tag.

https://openalex.org/W1419039884,"Background Establishment of a biological pacemaker is expected to solve the persisting problems of a mechanical pacemaker including the problems of battery life and electromagnetic interference. Enhancement of the funny current (If) flowing through hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and attenuation of the inward rectifier K+ current (IK1) flowing through inward rectifier potassium (Kir) channels are essential for generation of a biological pacemaker. Therefore, we generated HCN4-overexpressing mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and induced cardiomyocytes that originally show poor IK1 currents, and we investigated whether the HCN4-overexpressing mESC-derived cardiomyocytes (mESC-CMs) function as a biological pacemaker in vitro. Methods and Results The rabbit Hcn4 gene was transfected into mESCs, and stable clones were selected. mESC-CMs were generated via embryoid bodies and purified under serum/glucose-free and lactate-supplemented conditions. Approximately 90% of the purified cells were troponin I-positive by immunostaining. In mESC-CMs, expression level of the Kcnj2 gene encoding Kir2.1, which is essential for generation of IK1 currents that are responsible for stabilizing the resting membrane potential, was lower than that in an adult mouse ventricle. HCN4-overexpressing mESC-CMs expressed about a 3-times higher level of the Hcn4 gene than did non-overexpressing mESC-CMs. Expression of the Cacna1h gene, which encodes T-type calcium channel and generates diastolic depolarization in the sinoatrial node, was also confirmed. Additionally, genes required for impulse conduction including Connexin40, Connexin43, and Connexin45 genes, which encode connexins forming gap junctions, and the Scn5a gene, which encodes sodium channels, are expressed in the cells. HCN4-overexpressing mESC-CMs showed significantly larger If currents and more rapid spontaneous beating than did non-overexpressing mESC-CMs. The beating rate of HCN4-overexpressing mESC-CMs responded to ivabradine, an If inhibitor, and to isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist. Co-culture of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) with aggregates composed of mESC-CMs resulted in synchronized contraction of the cells. The beating rate of hiPSC-CMs co-cultured with aggregates of HCN4-overexpressing mESC-CMs was significantly higher than that of non-treated hiPSC-CMs and that of hiPSC-CMs co-cultured with aggregates of non-overexpressing mESC-CMs. Conclusions We generated HCN4-overexpresssing mESC-CMs expressing genes required for impulse conduction, showing rapid spontaneous beating, responding to an If inhibitor and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, and having pacing ability in an in vitro co-culture system with other excitable cells. The results indicated that these cells could be applied to a biological pacemaker."

In this study, 994 non-duplicate, carbapenem non-susceptible Klebsiella pneumonia isolates were collected in Taiwan from 2011 to 2013 for detection of the carbapenemase genes, assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility and molecular epidemiology studies. Of these 994 isolates, 183 (18.4%) had carbapenemase genes: 157 (15.8%) KPC (145 KPC-2 and 12 KPC-17), 16 (1.6%) IMP-8, 9 (0.9%) VIM-1, and 1 (0.1%) NDM-1. KPC had the highest prevalence rate among the carbapenemases and represented a major epidemic clone circulating in Taiwan. The ST512 and ST258 KPC-2 KPs were first identified in Taiwan and were grouped into a small cluster in the PFGE profile. In addition, the genetic structure encompassing the blaKPC gene of the ST512 and ST258 isolates showed a different pattern from that of other KPC isolates. ST11 may be a major sequence type circulating in Taiwan, although a specific minor clone has begun to be observed.

https://openalex.org/W2199984605,"Two protein translocases drive the import of β-barrel precursor proteins into the mitochondrial outer membrane: The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex) promotes transport of the precursor to the intermembrane space, whereas the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM complex) mediates subsequent folding of the β-barrel and its integration into the target membrane. The non-bilayer-forming phospholipids phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and cardiolipin (CL) are required for the biogenesis of β-barrel proteins. Whether bilayer-forming phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), the most abundant phospholipid of the mitochondrial outer membrane, play a role in the import of β-barrel precursors is unclear. In this study, we show that PC is required for stability and function of the SAM complex during the biogenesis of β-barrel proteins. PC further promotes the SAM-dependent assembly of the TOM complex, indicating a general role of PC for the function of the SAM complex. In contrast to PE-deficient mitochondria precursor accumulation at the TOM complex is not affected by depletion of PC.

https://openalex.org/W2176839263,"Comparing DNA or protein sequences plays an important role in the functional analysis of genomes. Despite many methods available for sequences comparison, few methods retain the information content of sequences. We propose a new approach, the Yau-Hausdorff method, which considers all translations and rotations when seeking the best match of graphical curves of DNA or protein sequences. The complexity of this method is lower than that of any other two dimensional minimum Hausdorff algorithm. The Yau-Hausdorff method can be used for measuring the similarity of DNA sequences based on two important tools: the Yau-Hausdorff distance and graphical representation of DNA sequences. The graphical representations of DNA sequences conserve all sequence information and the Yau-Hausdorff distance is mathematically proved as a true metric. Therefore, the proposed distance can preciously measure the similarity of DNA sequences. The phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences by the Yau-Hausdorff distance show the accuracy and stability of our approach in similarity comparison of DNA or protein sequences. This study demonstrates that Yau-Hausdorff distance is a natural metric for DNA and protein sequences with high level of stability. The approach can be also applied to similarity analysis of protein sequences by graphic representations, as well as general two dimensional shape matching."
https://openalex.org/W1466210299,"Type I interferons (IFNs) are secreted by many cell types upon stimulation via pattern recognition receptors and bind to IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Although type I IFNs are well known as anti-viral cytokines, limited information is available on their role during fungal infection. In the present study, we addressed this issue by examining the effect of IFNAR1 defects on the host defense response to Cryptococcus neoformans. In IFNAR1KO mice, the number of live colonies was lower and the host immune response mediated not only by Th1 but also by Th2 and Th17-related cytokines was more accelerated in the infected lungs than in WT mice. In addition, mucin production by bronchoepithelial cells and expression of MUC5AC, a major core protein of mucin in the lungs, were significantly higher in IFNAR1KO mice than in WT mice. This increase in mucin and MUC5AC production was significantly inhibited by treatment with neutralizing anti-IL-4 mAb. In contrast, administration of recombinant IFN-αA/D significantly suppressed the production of IL-4, but not of IFN-γ and IL-17A, in the lungs of WT mice after cryptococcal infection. These results indicate that defects of IFNAR1 led to improved clearance of infection with C. neoformans and enhanced synthesis of IFN-γ and the IL-4-dependent production of mucin. They also suggest that type I IFNs may be involved in the negative regulation of early host defense to this infection."
https://openalex.org/W2131949800,"Optical microscopy provides rich spatio-temporal information characterizing in vivo molecular motion. However, effective forces and other parameters used to summarize molecular motion change over time in live cells due to latent state changes, e.g., changes induced by dynamic micro-environments, photobleaching, and other heterogeneity inherent in biological processes. This study focuses on techniques for analyzing Single Particle Tracking (SPT) data experiencing abrupt state changes. We demonstrate the approach on GFP tagged chromatids experiencing metaphase in yeast cells and probe the effective forces resulting from dynamic interactions that reflect the sum of a number of physical phenomena. State changes are induced by factors such as microtubule dynamics exerting force through the centromere, thermal polymer fluctuations, etc. Simulations are used to demonstrate the relevance of the approach in more general SPT data analyses. Refined force estimates are obtained by adopting and modifying a nonparametric Bayesian modeling technique, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (HDP-SLDS), for SPT applications. The HDP-SLDS method shows promise in systematically identifying dynamical regime changes induced by unobserved state changes when the number of underlying states is unknown in advance (a common problem in SPT applications). We expand on the relevance of the HDP-SLDS approach, review the relevant background of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, show how to map discrete time HDP-SLDS models to classic SPT models, and discuss limitations of the approach. In addition, we demonstrate new computational techniques for tuning hyperparameters and for checking the statistical consistency of model assumptions directly against individual experimental trajectories; the techniques circumvent the need for ""ground-truth"" and subjective information."

VM4 can degrade exogenous N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL), hence it effectively attenuates the virulence of bacterial soft rot pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum strain BR1 (Pcc BR1) as a consequence of quorum sensing inhibition.Isolated Delftia sp. VM4 can grow in minimal medium supplemented with AHL as a sole source of carbon and energy. It also possesses the ability to degrade various AHL molecules in a short time interval. Delftia sp. VM4 suppresses AHL accumulation and the production of virulence determinant enzymes by Pcc BR1 without interference of the growth during co-culture cultivation. The quorum quenching activity was lost after the treatment with trypsin and proteinase K. The protein with quorum quenching activity was purified by three step process. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) and Mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis revealed that the AHL degrading enzyme (82 kDa) demonstrates homology with the NCBI database hypothetical protein (Daci_4366) of D. acidovorans SPH-1. The purified AHL acylase of Delftia sp. VM4 demonstrated optimum activity at 20-40°C and pH 6.2 as well as AHL acylase type mode of action. It possesses similarity with an α/β-hydrolase fold protein, which makes it unique among the known AHL acylases with domains of the N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn)-hydrolase superfamily. In addition, the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for hydrolysis of the different AHL substrates by purified AHL-acylase were estimated. Here we present the studies that investigate the mode of action and kinetics of AHL-degradation by purified AHL acylase from Delftia sp. VM4.We characterized an AHL-inactivating enzyme from Delftia sp. VM4, identified as AHL acylase showing distinctive similarity with α/β-hydrolase fold protein, described its biochemical and thermodynamic properties for the first time and revealed its potential application as an anti-virulence agent against bacterial soft rot pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum based on quorum quenching mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1873216933,"When foraging, animals can maximize their fitness if they are able to tailor their foraging decisions to current environmental conditions. When making foraging decisions, individuals need to assess the benefits of foraging while accounting for the potential risks of being captured by a predator. However, whether and how different factors interact to shape these decisions is not yet well understood, especially in individual foragers. Here we present a standardized set of manipulative field experiments in the form of foraging assays in the tropical lizard Anolis cristatellus in Puerto Rico. We presented male lizards with foraging opportunities to test how the presence of conspecifics, predation-risk perception, the abundance of food, and interactions among these factors determines the outcome of foraging decisions. In Experiment 1, anoles foraged faster when food was scarce and other conspecifics were present near the feeding tray, while they took longer to feed when food was abundant and when no conspecifics were present. These results suggest that foraging decisions in anoles are the result of a complex process in which individuals assess predation risk by using information from conspecific individuals while taking into account food abundance. In Experiment 2, a simulated increase in predation risk (i.e., distance to the feeding tray) confirmed the relevance of risk perception by showing that the use of available perches is strongly correlated with the latency to feed. We found Puerto Rican crested anoles integrate instantaneous ecological information about food abundance, conspecific activity and predation risk, and adjust their foraging behavior accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2192963863,"We demonstrate a substantial evidence that the word length can be an essential lexical structural feature for word evolution in written Chinese. The data used in this study are diachronic Chinese short narrative texts with a time span of over 2000-years. We show that the increase of word length is an essential regularity in word evolution. On the one hand, word frequency is found to depend on word length, and their relation is in line with the Power law function y = ax-b. On the other hand, our deeper analyses show that the increase of word length results in the simplification in characters for balance in written Chinese. Moreover, the correspondence between written and spoken Chinese is discussed. We conclude that the disyllabic trend may account for the increase of word length, and its impacts can be explained in ""the principle of least effort""."
https://openalex.org/W2202871524,"A combination of signals across modalities can facilitate sensory perception. The audiovisual facilitative effect strongly depends on the features of the stimulus. Here, we investigated how sound frequency, which is one of basic features of an auditory signal, modulates audiovisual integration. In this study, the task of the participant was to respond to a visual target stimulus by pressing a key while ignoring auditory stimuli, comprising of tones of different frequencies (0.5, 1, 2.5 and 5 kHz). A significant facilitation of reaction times was obtained following audiovisual stimulation, irrespective of whether the task-irrelevant sounds were low or high frequency. Using event-related potential (ERP), audiovisual integration was found over the occipital area for 0.5 kHz auditory stimuli from 190-210 ms, for 1 kHz stimuli from 170-200 ms, for 2.5 kHz stimuli from 140-200 ms, 5 kHz stimuli from 100-200 ms. These findings suggest that a higher frequency sound signal paired with visual stimuli might be early processed or integrated despite the auditory stimuli being task-irrelevant information. Furthermore, audiovisual integration in late latency (300-340 ms) ERPs with fronto-central topography was found for auditory stimuli of lower frequencies (0.5, 1 and 2.5 kHz). Our results confirmed that audiovisual integration is affected by the frequency of an auditory stimulus. Taken together, the neurophysiological results provide unique insight into how the brain processes a multisensory visual signal and auditory stimuli of different frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2170894815,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a peptide-fermenting asaccharolytic periodontal pathogen. Its genome contains several genes encoding cysteine peptidases other than gingipains. One of these genes (PG1055) encodes a protein called Tpr (thiol protease) that has sequence similarity to cysteine peptidases of the papain and calpain families. In this study we biochemically characterize Tpr. We found that the 55-kDa Tpr inactive zymogen proteolytically processes itself into active forms of 48, 37, and 33 kDa via sequential truncations at the N terminus. These processed molecular forms of Tpr are associated with the bacterial outer membrane where they are likely responsible for the generation of metabolic peptides required for survival of the pathogen. Both autoprocessing and activity were dependent on calcium concentrations >1 mm, consistent with the protein's activity within the intestinal and inflammatory milieus. Calcium also stabilized the Tpr structure and rendered the protein fully resistant to proteolytic degradation by gingipains. Together, our findings suggest that Tpr is an example of a bacterial calpain, a calcium-responsive peptidase that may generate substrates required for the peptide-fermenting metabolism of P. gingivalis. Aside from nutrient generation, Tpr may also be involved in evasion of host immune response through degradation of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 and complement proteins C3, C4, and C5. Taken together, these results indicate that Tpr likely represents an important pathogenesis factor for P. gingivalis."
https://openalex.org/W2176889722,"A decline in breast cancer incidence has been attributed to the reduction in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions since the publication of the landmark WHIT paper in 2003. Concurrently, a relationship between HRT and cerebrovascular disease incidence has also been suggested. No generalized analysis of HRT prescription rates and breast cancer incidence rates that included more than seven years of data. We hypothesized that detailed analysis of SEER data would clarify the relationship between HRT use and breast cancer incidence. Given the large decline in HRT prescription rates uncovered, analyses of potential complications were also conducted, with the understanding that a small effect or one limited to a subpopulation, such as a single race, might not be detected.Incidence rates (per 100,000 women) and standard errors for ductal and lobular breast carcinomas, and endometrioid /endometrial carcinomas in women over 50 years were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database 1992-2012. From the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey 1996-2012 weighted counts and standard errors of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions for women over 50 years were obtained. Using the National Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), 1996-2010 weighted counts and standard errors of femoral neck fractures, total hip replacements, acute myocardial infarctions, and cerebral infarctions were obtained for 50+ year men and women. Weighted counts and standard errors were divided by US census figures and multiplied by 100,000. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze rates.Beginning 2001, HRT prescription rates dropped dramatically, 2001-2012 AAPC -14.9 (95% CI -17.4, -12.4). Breast cancer rates, which began to decline in 1999, increased after 2003; 2012 rates were similar to those seen in 2001 for both ductal, AAPC 0.1 (-0.4, 0.6) and lobular, AAPC 0.5 (-0.4, 1.5), carcinoma. Endometrial carcinoma rates increased, 2001-2012 AAPC 3.5 (3.1, 3.8), arguing against a negative effect of HRT discontinuation of endometrial carcinoma. Tests for parallelism failed to detect APC differences among genders for femoral neck fractures (P = 0.24), for total hip replacements (P = 0.11), for myocardial infarctions (P = 0.10), or for cerebral infarctions (P = 0.19), precluding any assignment of general effect on these disorders by HRT.Using SEER data, we demonstrated that changes in breast cancer rates cannot be explained by HRT prescription rate changes."
https://openalex.org/W2207887787,"Mast cell exocytosis, which includes compound degranulation and vesicle-associated piecemeal degranulation, requires multiple Q- and R- SNAREs. It is not clear how these SNAREs pair to form functional trans-SNARE complexes and how these trans-SNARE complexes are selectively regulated for fusion. Here we undertake a comprehensive examination of the capacity of two Q-SNARE subcomplexes (syntaxin3/SNAP-23 and syntaxin4/SNAP-23) to form fusogenic trans-SNARE complexes with each of the four granule-borne R-SNAREs (VAMP2, 3, 7, 8). We report the identification of at least six distinct trans-SNARE complexes under enhanced tethering conditions: i) VAMP2/syntaxin3/SNAP-23, ii) VAMP2/syntaxin4/SNAP-23, iii) VAMP3/syntaxin3/SNAP-23, iv) VAMP3/syntaxin4/SNAP-23, v) VAMP8/syntaxin3/SNAP-23, and vi) VAMP8/syntaxin4/SNAP-23. We show for the first time that Munc18a operates synergistically with SNAP-23-based non-neuronal SNARE complexes (i to iv) in lipid mixing, in contrast to Munc18b and c, which exhibit no positive effect on any SNARE combination tested. Pre-incubation with Munc18a renders the SNARE-dependent fusion reactions insensitive to the otherwise inhibitory R-SNARE cytoplasmic domains, suggesting a protective role of Munc18a for its cognate SNAREs. Our findings substantiate the recently discovered but unexpected requirement for Munc18a in mast cell exocytosis, and implicate post-translational modifications in Munc18b/c activation."
https://openalex.org/W2262273174,"Suppressors of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3) is associated with limitations of nerve growth capacity after injury to the central nervous system. Although genetic manipulations of SOCS3 can enhance axonal regeneration after optic injury, the role of SOCS3 in dendritic outgrowth after spinal cord injury (SCI) is still unclear. The present study investigated the endogenous expression of SOCS3 and its role in regulating neurite outgrowth in vitro. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induces SOCS3 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in neuroscreen-1 (NS-1) cells. In parallel to SOCS3 expression, IL-6 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in NS-1 cells. Lentiviral delivery of short hairpin RNA (shSOCS3) (Lenti-shSOCS3) to decrease SOCS3 expression into NS-1 cells enhanced IL-6-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (P-STAT3 Tyr705) and promoted neurite outgrowth. In addition, we determined if reduction of SOCS3 expression by microinjection of Lenti-shSOCS3 into spinal cord enhances dendrite outgrowth in spinal cord neurons after SCI. Knocking down of SOCS3 in spinal cord neurons with Lenti-shSOCS3 increased complete SCI-induced P-STAT3 Tyr705. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that complete SCI induced a significant reduction of microtubule association protein 2-positive (MAP-2+) dendrites in the gray and white matter at 1 and 4 weeks after injury. The SCI-induced reduction of MAP-2+ dendrites was inhibited by infection with Lenti-shSOCS3 in areas both rostral and caudal to the lesion at 1 and 4 weeks after complete SCI. Furthermore, shSOCS3 treatment enhanced up-regulation of growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) expression, which co-localized with MAP-2+ dendrites in white matter and with MAP-2+ cell bodies in gray matter, indicating Lenti-shSOCS3 may induce dendritic regeneration after SCI. Moreover, we demonstrated that Lenti-shSOCS3 decreased SCI-induced demyelination in white matter of spinal cord both rostral and caudal to the injury site 1 week post-injury, but not rostral to the injury at 4 weeks post-injury. Importantly, similar effects as Lenti-shSOCS3 on increasing MAP-2+ intensity and dendrite length, and preventing demyelination were observed when a second shSOCS3 (Lenti-shSOCS3 #2) was applied to rule out the possibilities of off target effects of shRNA. Collectively, these results suggest that knocking down of SOCS3 enhances dendritic regeneration and prevents demyelination after SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2462707758,"Background Familial correlations underlie heritability estimates of psychosis. If gene-environment interactions are important, familial correlation will vary as a function of environmental exposure. Methods Associations between sibling and parental schizotypy (n = 669 pairs, n = 1222 observations), and between sibling schizotypy and patient CAPE psychosis (n = 978 pairs, n = 1723 observations) were examined as a function of sibling cannabis use. This design is based on the prediction that in unaffected siblings who are not exposed, vulnerability for psychosis will remain latent, whereas in case of exposure, latent psychosis vulnerability may become expressed, at the level of schizotypal symptoms, causing the phenotypic correlation between relatives to become “visible” under the influence of cannabis. Results Siblings exposed to recent cannabis use resembled their patient-relative more closely in terms of positive schizotypy (urinalysis(+):B = 0.30, P<.001; urinalysis(-):B = 0.10, p<0.001; p-interaction = 0.0135). Similarly, the familial correlation in positive schizotypy between parent and sibling was significantly greater in siblings recently exposed to cannabis (urinalysis(+):B = 0.78, P<.001; urinalysis(-):B = 0.43, p<0.001; p interaction = 0.0017). Results were comparable when using lifetime cannabis frequency of use as exposure instead of recent use. Parental schizotypy did not predict cannabis use in the healthy sibling, nor in the patient. Similarly, parental cannabis use was not associated with level of schizotypy in the sibling, nor with psychotic symptoms in the patient, making gene-environment correlation unlikely. Conclusion Familial correlation of psychosis-related experiences varies considerably as a function of exposure to cannabis, confirming the importance of gene-cannabis interaction in shifts of expression of psychosis-related experiences."
https://openalex.org/W3122541764,"Our research explored the incidence and appropriateness of the much-maligned confirmatory approach to testing scientific hypotheses. Psychological scientists completed a survey about their research goals and strategies. The most frequently reported goal is to test the non-absolute hypothesis that a particular relation exists in some conditions. As expected, few scientists reported testing universal hypotheses. Most indicated an inclination to use a confirmation strategy to test the non-absolute hypotheses that a particular relation sometimes occurs or sometimes does not occur, and a disconfirmation strategy to test the absolute hypotheses that a particular relation always occurs or never occurs. The confirmatory search that dominates the field was found to be associated with the testing of non-absolute hypotheses. Our analysis indicates that a confirmatory approach is the normatively correct test of the non-absolute hypotheses that are the starting point of most studies. It also suggests that the strategy of falsification that was once proposed by Popper is generally incorrect given the infrequency of tests of universal hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W4237685932,"Background and Purpose This study aimed to investigate the knowledge of community general practitioners (GPs) and nurses about pre-hospital stroke recognition, treatment and management and secondary stroke prevention; to identify the sociodemographic and educational factors influencing knowledge. Methods A self-designed test questionnaire was applied in a self-administered close-exam setting among 480 GPs and nurses working in community health centers (stations) in eight urban districts of Chongqing. Results A total of 331 (69%) valid test questionnaires were returned. Of the 331 participants, 39% were aware of the clinical guidelines for cerebrovascular diseases, whereas 48% considered themselves to have stroke management capabilities. The correct rate of answering questions of pre-hospital recognition and management knowledge was as low as 24%, the correct rate of secondary stroke prevention knowledge was only 38%. In terms of the total score for stroke prevention and treatment knowledge, there were significant differences between the medical staff with different specialties before engaging in community health services and whether they have received GP training (P <0.05). Conclusion The community GPs and nurses in the urban districts of Chongqing clearly lack knowledge of stroke, and the levels of stroke prevention and treatment urgently need to be improved."
https://openalex.org/W2215533007,"We examined several measures of self-reported HIV risk behaviour in mutually disclosed sero-discordant couples over time to see if a couples counselling intervention was associated with changes in these behaviors.We analysed data from a prospective cohort study of HIV sero-discordant couples in Jinja, Uganda collected between June 2009 and December 2011. Participants received couples counselling, at 3-monthly intervals. We examined trends in reported condom-use, number of concurrent sexual partners, knowledge of HIV serostatus of concurrent partners and condom use of concurrent partners using Generalized Estimating Equation models, comparing responses at study enrollment with responses at six, 12 18 and 24 months of follow-up.A total of 586 couples were enrolled and the female member was HIV positive in 255 (44%) of them. The median age for female participants was 35 years and 42 years for men. Reported condom use at last sex with spouse increased over time (p<0.001) with the largest increases found among couples where the positive participant never received ART during the study(an increase from 68.8% at enrollment to 97.1% at 24 months). Male participants reported reductions in the number of concurrent sexual partners (p<0.001), increase in the knowledge of the HIV serostatus of these partners (p = 0.001) and a trend towards improved condom-use among non-primary partners (p = 0.070). Reported reduced risky behaviors did not wane over the study period.Couples counselling resulted in increased condom use among all participants and among men the intervention resulted in reductions in risk behaviour with concurrent sexual partners. Routine counselling for serodiscordant couples should be integrated in routine ART care programs."
https://openalex.org/W2216685261,"Interferons (IFNs) have been shown to inhibit influenza A virus (IAV) replication and play an essential role in controlling viral infection. Here we studied the kinetics and magnitude of induction of type I and type III IFN transcripts by primary porcine airway epithelial cells (pAECs) in response to swine and human origin IAV. We observed that swine influenza viruses (SIV) replicate more efficiently than the human pandemic influenza A/California/2009 (pH1N1 CA/09) in pAECs. Interestingly, we also found significant difference in kinetics of IFN-β, IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ3 gene expression by these viruses. While there was delay of up to 12 hours post infection (h p.i.) in induction of IFN genes in pAECs infected with swine IAV A/Sw/Illinois/2008 (H1N1 IL/08), human pH1N1 CA/09 rapidly induced IFN-β, IFN-λ1 and IFN-λ3 gene expression as early as 4 h p.i. However, the magnitude of IFN-β and IFN-λ3 induction at 24 h p.i. was not significantly different between the viral strains tested. Additionally, we found that swine H1N1 IL/08 was less sensitive to dsRNA induced antiviral response compared to human pH1N1 CA/09. Our data suggest that the human and swine IAVs differ in their ability to induce and respond to type I and type III interferons in swine cells. Swine origin IAV may have adapted to the pig host by subverting innate antiviral responses to viral infection."
https://openalex.org/W2200946595,"After I finished my Ph.D. studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2012, my career was at a crossroads. I had gone to graduate school with the hope of pursuing a career in academia, but by the time I got my degree, that dream seemed far from reality. I was burned out, and I couldn't even bring myself to look for postdoctoral positions, let alone consider a lifetime in the lab. I also knew I couldn't possibly make an objective decision about what I should do for the rest of my life. I needed a break.

> “I was burned out. … I needed a break.” 

I am often drawn to extremes, so I thought: “What could possibly be further from a Ph.D. in chemistry than to thru-hike the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), traversing the United States from Mexico to Canada?”

It was May and the sun was blazing at the California-Mexico border when I began my 2668-mile journey. Just days before I had been working in a chemistry lab, conducting research that I could take in seemingly infinite directions, but now there was just one: north. I started walking.

Over the next several weeks, my focus narrowed until my biggest concern was the number of miles to the next water source. I simply wanted to physically survive each day, which was a welcome change from the previous 5 years. In contrast with my experience in graduate school, progress on the trail was well defined and quantifiable: Each step brought me closer to Canada. Occupied with satisfying my immediate physical needs, I didn't spend much time consciously thinking about the future.

But after 16 weeks, 4 days, and 7 hours, I reached the Canadian border and my hiking adventure was over. Reality set in: I needed to return home and figure out what I was going to do next. I caught a bus from the trail's northern terminus at the Canadian border to Vancouver, then another bus to Seattle, Washington, then a flight back to Boston. I returned home 45 pounds under my typical healthy weight, as it had been difficult for me to consume all the calories I needed to hike nearly a marathon a day. While I recovered, I needed to eat every few hours and walk several miles each day to prevent leg spasms. It also took time to readjust emotionally to a life where there was no obvious, well-trodden path to follow.

I felt bored and detached after my trek, but this only made me more eager to start a new journey. Initially, I wasn't sure I was any closer to making a career decision than I had been before I started my hike, but after a few weeks of rest and recovery, it became clear that the weeks on the trail had refreshed me and renewed my love of science. I wanted to read journal articles to learn of new discoveries that had been reported while I was away. I was eager to embark on independent research. Most importantly, I missed the community of academics I had left behind.

So I decided I wanted to do a postdoc after all. I set up a meeting with my graduate school adviser, who then put me in contact with the lab head who would become my postdoctoral adviser. His research team was designing new organic flow battery chemistries, and it was a perfect fit for everyone: They got the synthetic chemist they needed, and I got a chance to work in an applied field with engineers, physical chemists, and theoreticians.

After hiking, I began to think much more about big-picture ideas than I had in graduate school. Although my Ph.D. said “Inorganic Chemistry,” to the motley group of hikers I encountered on the trail I was simply a scientist. I took that identity to heart and came back to the lab with fewer inhibitions about learning new fields of research. I had also become more accepting of the messiness of cutting-edge science. Basic research can be slow and in efficient, and sometimes it's not clear if the effort will be worth the reward of discovery. But hiking the PCT helped me learn to celebrate little accomplishments, and to take each day and each experiment one step at a time—lessons that have served me well as I pursue my academic career path.
