https://openalex.org/W3025871232,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus with high nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and to SARS-related coronaviruses that have been detected in horseshoe bats, has spread across the world and had a global effect on healthcare systems and economies1,2. A suitable small animal model is needed to support the development of vaccines and therapies. Here we report the pathogenesis and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in golden (Syrian) hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Immunohistochemistry assay demonstrated the presence of viral antigens in nasal mucosa, bronchial epithelial cells and areas of lung consolidation on days 2 and 5 after inoculation with SARS-CoV-2, followed by rapid viral clearance and pneumocyte hyperplasia at 7 days after inoculation. We also found viral antigens in epithelial cells of the duodenum, and detected viral RNA in faeces. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted efficiently from inoculated hamsters to naive hamsters by direct contact and via aerosols. Transmission via fomites in soiled cages was not as efficient. Although viral RNA was continuously detected in the nasal washes of inoculated hamsters for 14 days, the communicable period was short and correlated with the detection of infectious virus but not viral RNA. Inoculated and naturally infected hamsters showed apparent weight loss on days 6–7 post-inoculation or post-contact; all hamsters returned to their original weight within 14 days and developed neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that features associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in golden hamsters resemble those found in humans with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections. The pathogenicity and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in golden (Syrian) hamsters resemble features of COVID-19 in human patients, suggesting that these hamsters could be used to model this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3026002191,"A new coronavirus was recently discovered and named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 in humans causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been rapidly spreading around the globe1,2. SARS-CoV-2 shows some similarities to other coronaviruses; however, treatment options and an understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 infects cells are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 and show that inhibition of these pathways prevents viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell-culture model for infection with a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2. Using this cell-culture system, we determined the infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 by translatome3 and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 reshapes central cellular pathways such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism, protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and nucleic acid metabolism. Small-molecule inhibitors that target these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of SARS-CoV-2 and have enabled the identification of drugs that inhibit viral replication. We anticipate that our results will guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the modulation of host cells after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, our findings provide insights for the development of therapies for the treatment of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3024382268,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in Wuhan in December 2019 and caused coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1,2. In 2003, the closely related SARS-CoV had been detected in domestic cats and a dog3. However, little is known about the susceptibility of domestic pet mammals to SARS-CoV-2. Here, using PCR with reverse transcription, serology, sequencing the viral genome and virus isolation, we show that 2 out of 15 dogs from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in five nasal swabs collected over a 13-day period from a 17-year-old neutered male Pomeranian. A 2.5-year-old male German shepherd was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA on two occasions and virus was isolated from nasal and oral swabs. Antibody responses were detected in both dogs using plaque-reduction-neutralization assays. Viral genetic sequences of viruses from the two dogs were identical to the virus detected in the respective human cases. The dogs remained asymptomatic during quarantine. The evidence suggests that these are instances of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. It is unclear whether infected dogs can transmit the virus to other animals or back to humans. Two out of 15 dogs from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 were asymptomatically infected with SARS-CoV-2 and showed antibody responses to the virus."

Zellweger et al. provide a long-term, continental-scale assessment of the effects of micro- and macroclimate on the community composition of European forests (see the Perspective by Lembrechts and Nijs). They show that changes in forest canopy cover are fundamentally important for driving community responses to climate change. Closed canopies buffer against the effects of macroclimatic change through their cooling effect, slowing shifts in community composition, whereas open canopies tend to accelerate community change through local heating effects.

https://openalex.org/W3025183036,"A genetic history of China The history of human movements into and within China has been difficult to determine solely from archaeological investigations or genetic studies of contemporary peoples. Yang et al. sequenced DNA from 26 individuals from 9500 to 300 years ago from locations within China. Analyses of these individuals, along with previously sequenced ancient individuals and present-day genomes representing global populations, show a split between ancient humans in northern and southern China. Neolithic northern Chinese individuals are closest to modern-day East Asians, whereas ancient individuals from southern China are most closely related to modern-day Southeast Asians and show an affinity to modern-day Austronesian populations. These results indicate that there was a southward movement and admixture of peoples during the Neolithic that gave rise to modern-day populations in East Asia. Science this issue p. 282"

https://openalex.org/W3024848554,"De novo protein design has been successful in expanding the natural protein repertoire. However, most de novo proteins lack biological function, presenting a major methodological challenge. In vaccinology, the induction of precise antibody responses remains a cornerstone for next-generation vaccines. Here, we present a protein design algorithm called TopoBuilder, with which we engineered epitope-focused immunogens displaying complex structural motifs. In both mice and nonhuman primates, cocktails of three de novo-designed immunogens induced robust neutralizing responses against the respiratory syncytial virus. Furthermore, the immunogens refocused preexisting antibody responses toward defined neutralization epitopes. Overall, our design approach opens the possibility of targeting specific epitopes for the development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies and, more generally, will be applicable to the design of de novo proteins displaying complex functional motifs."

https://openalex.org/W3024719448,"Speeding up borylation Catalytic borylation is the rare reaction that can selectively target stronger over weaker saturated carbon–hydrogen (C–H) bonds. However, the trade-off has been that the reaction is slow and requires high excess of the hydrocarbon. Oeschger et al. now report that the right ligand (2-methylphenanthroline) coordinated to iridium can accelerate the reaction by 50- to 80-fold. This rate enhancement enables selective borylation of primary C–H bonds with the hydrocarbon as limiting reagent. The reaction is also unusually selective for β-C–H bonds in saturated heterocycles.

https://openalex.org/W3024064700,"Mapping vertebrate incompatibility alleles Deleterious gene interactions may underlie the observed hybrid incompatibilities. However, few genes underlying hybrid incompatibilities have been identified, and most of these involve species that do not hybridize in natural conditions. Powell et al. used genome sequencing to map genes likely responsible for incompatibilities that reduce fitness in naturally occurring hybrid swordtail fish. These gene combinations result in malignant melanoma, which is found in naturally hybridizing populations but is not present in the parental populations (see the Perspective by Dagilis and Matute). Using genome and population resequencing, the authors performed a genome-wide association study to identify potentially causative mutations. Using an admixture mapping approach that assessed introgression between multiple swordtail fish species, the authors suggest that lineages carry different genes that interact with the same candidate gene, resulting in the observed melanomas and providing insight into convergent hybrid incompatibles that arise between species.

Two groups have now probed gene expression in experiments and models using data obtained during the developmental cycles of P. falciparum in vitro and in the mouse model of P. chabaudi malaria. Smith et al. discovered that four strains of P. falciparum have circadian and cell cycle oscillators, each with distinctive periodicities that can be experimentally manipulated.

Xie et al. detected unusual QI oscillations in the differential cross section measured in the recoil scattering direction of the prototypical elementary reaction H + HD → H 2 + D (see the Perspective by Aoiz). Topological analysis showed that this pattern originates from the QI between a direct abstraction and previously unknown rebounding insertion pathways, which are affected by the geometric phase at energies far below the conical intersection. The QI observed between these two distinctive pathways in the three-atom system is a clear example of the quantum nature of chemical reactivity. Science , this issue p. 767 ; see also p. 706"
https://openalex.org/W3025156093,"Retinal fundus photography provides a non-invasive approach for identifying early microcirculatory alterations of chronic diseases prior to the onset of overt clinical complications. Here, we developed neural network models to predict hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and a range of risk factors from retinal fundus images obtained from a cross-sectional study of chronic diseases in rural areas of Xinxiang County, Henan, in central China. 1222 high-quality retinal images and over 50 measurements of anthropometry and biochemical parameters were generated from 625 subjects. The models in this study achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.880 in predicting hyperglycemia, of 0.766 in predicting hypertension, and of 0.703 in predicting dyslipidemia. In addition, these models can predict with AUC>0.7 several blood test erythrocyte parameters, including hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and a cluster of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Taken together, deep learning approaches are feasible for predicting hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and risks of other chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3025236532,"Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-expressing neurons are key regulators of energy and glucose homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that they provide dense projections to the median eminence (ME) in close proximity to tanycytes and fenestrated vessels. Chemogenetic activation of MCH neurons as well as optogenetic stimulation of their projections in the ME enhance permeability of the ME by increasing fenestrated vascular loops and enhance leptin action in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC). Unbiased phosphoRiboTrap-based assessment of cell activation upon chemogenetic MCH neuron activation reveals MCH-neuron-dependent regulation of endothelial cells. MCH neurons express the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), and blocking VEGF-R signaling attenuates the leptin-sensitizing effect of MCH neuron activation. Our experiments reveal that MCH neurons directly regulate permeability of the ME barrier, linking the activity of energy state and sleep regulatory neurons to the regulation of hormone accessibility to the ARC."

However, deep long-period earthquakes (DLPs) are a special type of seismicity tied most often to quiescent volcanoes. Wech et al. found more than a million of these DLPs under the inactive Mauna Kea volcano in Hawai'i over the past 19 years (see the Perspective by Matoza). Analysis of this large number of observations allowed the authors to conclude that the DLPs were connected to a deep, cooling magma body. Deep gas releases triggered by minerals crystallizing in the deep magma through the “second boiling” process may open cracks, triggering the DLPs. Science , this issue p. 775 ; see also p. 708"
https://openalex.org/W3025919310,"The human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) harbors a well-orchestrated Clp (caseinolytic protease) proteolytic machinery consisting of two oligomeric segments, a barrel-shaped heterotetradecameric protease core comprising the ClpP1 and ClpP2 subunits, and hexameric ring-like ATP-dependent unfoldases composed of ClpX or ClpC1. The roles of the ClpP1P2 protease subunits are well-established in Mtb, but the potential roles of the associated unfoldases, such as ClpC1, remain elusive. Using a CRISPR interference–mediated gene silencing approach, here we demonstrate that clpC1 is indispensable for the extracellular growth of Mtb and for its survival in macrophages. The results from isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation–based quantitative proteomic experiments with clpC1- and clpP2-depleted Mtb cells suggested that the ClpC1P1P2 complex critically maintains the homeostasis of various growth-essential proteins in Mtb, several of which contain intrinsically disordered regions at their termini. We show that the Clp machinery regulates dosage-sensitive proteins such as the small heat shock protein Hsp20, which exists in a dodecameric conformation. Further, we observed that Hsp20 is poorly expressed in WT Mtb and that its expression is greatly induced upon depletion of clpC1 or clpP2. Remarkably, high Hsp20 protein levels were detected in the clpC1(−) or clpP2(−) knockdown strains but not in the parental bacteria, despite significant induction of hsp20 transcripts. In summary, the cellular levels of oligomeric proteins such as Hsp20 are maintained post-translationally through their recognition, disassembly, and degradation by ClpC1, which requires disordered ends in its protein substrates.

In summary, the cellular levels of oligomeric proteins such as Hsp20 are maintained post-translationally through their recognition, disassembly, and degradation by ClpC1, which requires disordered ends in its protein substrates. Stringent control of protein expression in a pathogen during regular growth condition, as well as in response to extracellular stimuli during infection, is an important determinant of its virulence (1Aderem A. Underhill D.M. Mechanisms of phagocytosis in macrophages.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17 (10358769): 593-62310.1146/annurev.immunol.17.1.593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Proteostasis, a process of maintaining homeostasis for cellular proteins, primarily relies on the synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation of proteins (2Santra M. Farrell D.W. Dill K.A. Bacterial proteostasis balances energy and chaperone utilization efficiently.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2017; 114 (28292901): E2654-E266110.1073/pnas.1620646114Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Most intracellular proteins constantly undergo degradation and resynthesis. The overall rate of synthesis and degradation decides the shelf life of proteins in the cell, which varies from a few minutes to days (3Belle A. Tanay A. Bitincka L. Shamir R. O'Shea E.K. Quantification of protein half-lives in the budding yeast proteome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103 (16916930): 13004-1300910.1073/pnas.0605420103Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition, although certain proteins can be overexpressed to multiple orders of magnitude, many proteins are dosage-sensitive, and their overexpression beyond a threshold limit is detrimental for bacterial growth, which must be taken care of by the respective protease machinery (4Vavouri T. Semple J.I. Garcia-Verdugo R. Lehner B. Intrinsic protein disorder and interaction promiscuity are widely associated with dosage sensitivity.Cell. 2009; 138 (19596244): 198-20810.1016/j.cell.2009.04.029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Proteolysis is an essential quality control system of the cell which maintains the level of cellular proteins by involving various proteases. Although general proteolysis is involved in removal of misfolded or damaged proteins, regulated proteolysis works under specific signals. In the cell, proteostasis requires a consorted activity of ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAAs) and proteases. Typically, the multisubunit protease complex consists of the proteolytic component and regulatory ATPases. The ATPases chiefly perform the maintenance function (5Ghazaei C. Line El Helou M. Beyond proteostasis: roles of type I chaperonins in bacterial pathogenesis.J. Med. Microbiol. 2018; 67 (30074472): 1203-121110.1099/jmm.0.000811Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), whereas proteases act as final executioners in the life cycle of proteins (6Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475 (21776078): 324-33210.1038/nature10317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar). Known cases of such multicompartmentalized systems such as Clp (caseinolytic protease), Lon protease, or 20S proteasome reveal that the executory nature of proteases is managed by their fundamental architecture comprising of multisubunit chambered structure with a central pore, whereas associated ATPases such as ClpX, ClpA, ClpC1, or 19S proteasome, which are commonly known as unfoldases, recognize, unfold, and translocate the prospective substrate proteins into the proteolytic chamber (7Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. AAA+ proteins: have engine, will work.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6 (16072036): 519-52910.1038/nrm1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Hence, studying these diverse proteins will be pivotal in completely understanding the overall protein homeostasis in a cell. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis in humans, stands among the most dreaded and successful human pathogens while silently encompassing the majority of world’s population (8Getahun H. Matteelli A. Chaisson R.E. Raviglione M. Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection.N. Engl. J. Med. 2015; 372 (26017823): 2127-213510.1056/NEJMra1405427Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Recent estimates of the absolute concentrations of the annotated proteins in Mtb reveal that 90% are scarcely expressed within a range of 2 orders of magnitude (9Schubert O.T. Mouritsen J. Ludwig C. Röst H.L. Rosenberger G. Arthur P.K. Claassen M. Campbell D.S. Sun Z. Farrah T. Gengenbacher M. Maiolica A. Kaufmann S.H.E. Moritz R.L. Aebersold R. The Mtb proteome library: a resource of assays to quantify the complete proteome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Cell Host Microbe. 2013; 13 (23684311): 602-61210.1016/j.chom.2013.04.008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that a large fraction of mycobacterial proteome is tightly regulated. Complex evolution and years of adaptation has empowered Mtb with unique proteostasis network. Although mycobacteria are endowed with a range of chaperones such as GroEL1, GroEL2, DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE, and ClpB involved in regulating the native conformation of protein, presence of Clp, FtsH, and proteasome-like machinery ensures adequate execution of erroneous or terminally exhausted proteins. Although FtsH, a membrane protease, and Pup-proteasome system play crucial roles in mycobacterial survival during various stresses and infection, respectively, the Clp machinery is the standalone cytosolic protease driving proteolysis under the normal physiological conditions (10Lupoli T.J. Vaubourgeix J. Burns-Huang K. Gold B. Targeting the proteostasis network for mycobacterial drug discovery.ACS Infect. Dis. 2018; 4 (29465983): 478-49810.1021/acsinfecdis.7b00231Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In Mtb, Clp protease consists of two proteolytic subunits namely ClpP1 and ClpP2 and an unfoldase, ClpX (Class II) or ClpC1 (class I; orthologous to ClpA), which together constitute the multisubunit chambered protein complex (11Alhuwaider A.A.H. Dougan D.A. AAA+ machines of protein destruction in mycobacteria.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 (28770209): 4910.3389/fmolb.2017.00049Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). ClpP1P2 are known to form functional heterocomplex of 14 subunits with 7 subunits from each protein, whereas Clp ATPases constitute a homohexameric chamber that is uniquely attached to the ClpP2 subunit of ClpP1P2 tetradecameric complex (12Leodolter J. Warweg J. Weber-Ban E. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis ClpP1P2 protease interacts asymmetrically with its ATPase partners ClpX and ClpC1.PLoS One. 2015; 10 (25933022): e012534510.1371/journal.pone.0125345Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Functionally, Clp ATPases are supposed to recognize and associate with the putative substrate, unfold it, and subsequently translocate into the ClpP1P2 proteolytic chamber (13Schmitz K.R. Sauer R.T. Substrate delivery by the AAA+ ClpX and ClpC1 unfoldases activates the mycobacterial ClpP1P2 peptidase.Mol. Microbiol. 2014; 93 (24976069): 617-62810.1111/mmi.12694Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Whole-cell proteomic study with conditional clpP1P2 knockdown strain has established the essential nature of these proteins in Mtb physiology and intracellular survival (14Raju R.M. Jedrychowski M.P. Wei J.-R. Pinkham J.T. Park A.S. O'Brien K. Rehren G. Schnappinger D. Gygi S.P. Rubin E.J. Post-translational regulation via Clp protease is critical for survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10 (24603869): e100399410.1371/journal.ppat.1003994Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Unfortunately such characterization has not been attempted yet to delineate the function of associated unfoldases in the pathophysiology of Mtb. Although the transposon-based TRASH screen predicts the clpC1 gene to be indispensable (15DeJesus M.A. Gerrick E.R. Xu W. Park S.W. Long J.E. Boutte C.C. Rubin E.J. Schnappinger D. Ehrt S. Fortune S.M. Sassetti C.M. Ioerger T.R. Comprehensive essentiality analysis of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome via saturating transposon mutagenesis.MBio. 2017; 8 (28096490): e02133-1610.1128/mBio.02133-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the fundamental cause of its essentiality in Mtb is not understood. Moreover, its homologue is functionally redundant in other bacteria such as Escherichia coli (16Porankiewicz J. Wang J. Clarke A.K. New insights into the ATP-dependent Clp protease: Escherichia coli and beyond.Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32 (10320569): 449-45810.1046/j.1365-2958.1999.01357.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Hence, it is critical to experimentally determine the requirement of ClpC1P1P2 machinery to better characterize the role of ClpC1 in mycobacteria. Using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) approach of gene silencing (17Choudhary E. Thakur P. Pareek M. Agarwal N. Gene silencing by CRISPR interference in mycobacteria.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (25711368): 626710.1038/ncomms7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), here we establish that akin to clpP1 and clpP2, clpC1 is essential across different mycobacterial species including the pathogenic Mtb H37Rv, the nonpathogenic Mtb H37Ra, and the fast-growing soil bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) during extracellular growth, as well as in macrophages. Global protein expression profiling by quantitative proteomics indicates that the ClpC1P1P2 protein complex acts on a distinct set of proteins that are involved in a plethora of essential cellular functions including central metabolism and cell wall biosynthesis. Although comparative sequence analysis identifies known signatures of Clp machinery in a small subset of candidate proteins, ∼85% of these sequences are enriched with disorder-promoting residues at either the N or the C terminus, suggesting a possible role for terminal disordered regions in their recognition by Clp protease. Finally, we show that the small heat shock protein Hsp20, which is highly accumulated in clpC1(−) and clpP2(−) strains of Mtb, is a dosage-sensitive protein, and its expression is maintained in Mtb exclusively by ClpC1P1P2 proteolytic machinery by recognition of its C-terminal region, which is disordered. To understand the requirement of ClpC1, we constructed CRISPRi-based knockdown strains of Mtb H37Rv, conditionally depleted for clpC1 (annotated as clpC1(−)) in an anhydrotetracycline (ATc)–dependent manner, typically as described earlier (17Choudhary E. Thakur P. Pareek M. Agarwal N. Gene silencing by CRISPR interference in mycobacteria.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6 (25711368): 626710.1038/ncomms7267Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). As a positive control, clpP2 was also targeted using the same approach (annotated as clpP2(−)). The ATc-dependent nature of silencing enabled us to fine-tune the dosage of target genes with minimal intervention. Treatment of respective knockdown strains with 50 ng/ml ATc for 7 days resulted in 70–80% suppression of clpP2 and clpC1, respectively, compared with their levels in empty vector control (Fig. 1, A and B). Next, we analyzed the growth profile of clpC1(−) and compared it with clpP2(−) strain by determining A600 as well as bacterial colony-forming unit (CFU) over a period of 2 weeks. As presented in Fig. 1C, cultures of empty vector containing control strain grow to full turbidity and achieve A600 of 3.5 by 14 days, whereas bacteria depleted with either of these genes were unable to grow beyond A600 of 0.30. Furthermore, CFU estimation indicates that the clpC1(−) and clpP2(−) strains proliferate in the synthetic culture medium, albeit at a much slower rate compared with the empty-plasmid control (Fig. 1, D and E). Similar results were obtained with suppression of orthologous genes in the slow-growing avirulent strain Mtb H37Ra (Fig. S1A) or in fast-growing soil-borne Msm (Fig. S1B). These results thus conclude that ClpC1 unfoldase is required for bacterial replication across different mycobacterial species, irrespective of their growth rate or virulence. The extreme dependence of Mtb on the ClpC1 protein for its extracellular growth demonstrates critical requirement of ClpC1 in the management of the core metabolic processes. To further examine the requirement of ClpC1 for intracellular growth of Mtb, THP1 human monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with mid-log grown cultures of control and clpC1(−) strains at an MOI of 1:2 for 4 h. Subsequently, growth of mycobacteria was monitored by CFU plating of macrophage lysates at different intervals. As may be seen in Fig. 2A, the knockdown strain exhibits poor growth in THP1 macrophages compared with the control bacteria. Although the control Mtb cells show a substantial increase in bacterial counts on days 5 and 7 post-infection (3.92, 4.03, 4.03, 4.80, and 5.25 log10 CFU/well on 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after infection, respectively), growth of clpC1(−) within macrophages is essentially stalled (3.79, 3.88, 4.09, 4.13, and 4.24 log10 CFU/well on 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after infection, respectively). A similar level of attenuation in the intracellular growth was observed with clpP2(−) strain of Mtb H37Rv. Infection of THP1 with bacteria depleted with clpP2 resulted in complete cessation of growth because bacterial CFU did not increase by more than 5–8% of the initial CFU counts of 3.87 log10 CFU/well on day 0 (Fig. 2B). Based on these results, we conclude that ClpC1 and ClpP1P2 are indispensable for intracellular survival of Mtb in host macrophages. In general, any given compartmentalized degradation machinery works by implementing the activity of protease and assisting unfoldase for effective proteolysis (11Alhuwaider A.A.H. Dougan D.A. AAA+ machines of protein destruction in mycobacteria.Front. Mol. Biosci. 2017; 4 (28770209): 4910.3389/fmolb.2017.00049Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The fundamental role of the associated ATPase is to provide specificity by recognizing, linearizing, and translocating the corresponding substrate to the protease chamber. The physiological essentiality of ClpC1 ATPase may be determined by the kind of substrates that are dependent on this protein for their appropriate regulation. Therefore, it becomes quintessential to define the prospective substrates of ClpC1P1P2 machinery to completely decipher the workings of Clp complex in mycobacterium. Possible substrates of ClpXP and ClpAP machinery have been identified in E. coli using ClpP trap mutant (18Flynn J.M. Neher S.B. Kim Y.I. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Proteomic discovery of cellular substrates of the ClpXP protease reveals five classes of ClpX-recognition signals.Mol. Cell. 2003; 11 (12667450): 671-68310.1016/S1097-2765(03)00060-1Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). However, a similar approach did not work with Mtb because clpP1 and clpP2 genes are essential for growth and loss of clpP2 could not be complemented by expressing the S110A trap mutant (data not shown). Alternatively, we followed an approach wherein all such proteins that are accumulated in clpC1 knockdown strain were identified. We speculate that candidate proteins simultaneously showing abundance in an unrelated clpP2(-) strain may correspond to putative substrates of ClpC1P1P2. To achieve this objective, a global proteomic approach of iTRAQ-based LC–MS was implemented, as described under “Experimental procedures”. As summarized in Fig. 3A, whole-cell lysates were prepared after 4 days of ATc treatment from control, clpC1(−), and clpP2(−) strains and equal amount of proteins from each of these strains were subjected to tryptic digestion and labeling with four-plex isobaric tags followed by LC–MS. The time point was carefully chosen so that there is no major growth defect among strains. The iTRAQ data were obtained from two biological replicates with quantitation of ∼45% of total Mtb proteins based on at least two peptides in both the sets (Fig. 3B and Data Set S1). Further analysis reveals that 317 proteins in clpC1(−) and 359 proteins in clpP2(−) strains of Mtb H37Rv exhibit ≥1.5-fold accumulation in both the biological replicates. Importantly, 69% proteins accumulated in clpC1(−) (n = 219) are common to clpP2(−) (Fig. 3C). Apart from these, several proteins exhibit down-regulation upon depletion of clp genes; we anticipate that these are indirectly regulated either at the level of transcription or translation (Data Set S1). Furthermore, it was observed that 37% of proteins universally accumulated in both clpC1(−) and clpP2(−) strains are involved in intermediary metabolism and respiration, 24% regulate lipid metabolism, and cell wall and cell processes, whereas 27% are unknown (Table 1 and Fig. 3D). Remarkably, 38% proteins (n = 82) that are modulated in the above knockdown strains are essential for in vitro growth of Mtb (Table 1). Our results show that proteins mainly involved in energy production (AtpG, AtpA, AtpH, AtpD, Tkt, Ndh, Pgi, Gap, AceE, Pyk, PckA, GltA2, Gdh, Rv0248c, NadB, HemL, DlaT, LpdC, MenB, and EttA), amino acid metabolism (ThrC, ThrS, TrpS, GcvB, AspC, AlaS, HisC1, LysA, BkdB, IlvB1, GlnE, SerC, PheA, and GlyA1), protein homeostasis and transport (Rv3780, PrcB, Ffh, SecA1, SecA2, DnaJ1, DnaJ2, GrpE, ClpP1, and ClpB), Esx secretion system (EspE, EccA3, EccC3, EccD3, EspG3, and EccC5), cell wall biosynthesis (FabG1, GlgB, GlgE, InhA, AccD5, AccD6, and FtsH), transcription (SigA, CarD, SigE, MoxR1, and RbpA), DNA synthesis (PolA, NrdE, and GuaB2), and redox balance (TrxB2, SahH, and Mrp) are under regulation by Clp machinery, and their perturbation might be accountable for apparent lethality of respective knockdown strains (Table 1).Table 1List of proteins differentially accumulated in Mtb H37Rv in response to depletion of clpP2 and clpC1S.

https://openalex.org/W3024314955,"Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) is an integral membrane protein that is highly up-regulated on the cell surface of several human cancers, making it a promising therapeutic target to manage these diseases. It shares sequence homology with three enzymes (STEAP2–STEAP4) that catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of iron(III). However, STEAP1 lacks an intracellular NADPH-binding domain and does not exhibit cellular ferric reductase activity.

Indeed, several strategies for targeting STEAP1 in cancer have been explored; in 2007, a study reported the production and characterization of two monoclonal antibodies (mAb120.545 and mAb92.30) that bind STEAP1 with nanomolar affinity on prostate cancer cells and inhibit the growth of prostate and bladder tumor xenografts in mice (5Challita-Eid P.M.

At the molecular level, the four STEAP proteins are predicted to adopt a common architecture with intracellular N and C termini, six transmembrane helices, and a single heme B prosthetic group bound in the transmembrane domain (TMD) (26Kleven M.D. Dlakić M.

In contrast to STEAP2–STEAP4, STEAP1 does not exhibit metalloreductase activity when overexpressed on mammalian cells (19Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. McDonald A. Fleming M.D. The Steap proteins are metalloreductases.Blood. 2006; 108 (16609065): 1388-139410.1182/blood-2006-02-003681Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may have a distinct yet unidentified function. However, a recent study revealed that dithionite-reduced, purified STEAP1 retains heme and is capable of reducing metal-ion complexes and oxygen (30Kim K. Mitra S. Wu G. Berka V. Song J. Yu Y. Poget S. Wang D.-N. Tsai A.-L. Zhou M.

It has been proposed that STEAP1 may have a functional role in heterooligomeric complexes with other STEAP paralogues (19Ohgami R.S. Campagna D.R. McDonald A. Fleming M.D. The Steap proteins are metalloreductases.Blood. 2006; 108 (16609065): 1388-139410.1182/blood-2006-02-003681Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 30Kim K. Mitra S. Wu G. Berka V.

In support of this, its expression often correlates with the expression of STEAP2 in cancers (17Grunewald T.G.P. Bach H. Cossarizza A. Matsumoto I. The STEAP protein family: versatile oxidoreductases and targets for cancer immunotherapy with overlapping and distinct cellular functions.Biol. Cell. 2012; 104 (22804687): 641-65710.1111/boc.201200027Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and both proteins co-purify in detergent (30Kim K. Mitra S. Wu G. Berka V. Song J. Yu Y. Poget S.

Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1 (STEAP1) has a single b heme and is capable of reducing metal ion complexes and oxygen.Biochemistry. 2016; 55 (27792302): 6673-668410.1021/acs.biochem.6b00610Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), suggesting that they could form a functional complex. Further indications for a functional heterotrimeric STEAP complex emerged from the recent cryo-EM structures of homotrimeric human STEAP4 (29Oosterheert W. van Bezouwen L.S. Rodenburg R.N.P. Granneman J. Förster F. Mattevi A. Gros P. Cryo-EM structures of human STEAP4 reveal mechanism of iron(III) reduction.Nat.

This arrangement supports a model in which the heme in STEAP1 receives electrons from NADPH bound to an adjacent STEAP2/3/4 subunit. However, the in vivo redox activity of STEAP1, in both the absence and presence of other STEAP paralogues, remains to be established. In addition, there are no high-resolution structures available to help distinguish a functional role for STEAP1 as a metalloreductase or, as previously proposed, a potential channel or transporter protein (1Hubert R.S.

Thus, although STEAP1 is a populous plasma membrane component of many different types of cancer cells and hence is a promising novel therapeutic target, its structure and function in both health and disease remain unknown. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of full-length, trimeric human STEAP1 bound to three Fab fragments of the therapeutically relevant mAb120.545. The Fabs dock on the extracellular helices of STEAP1 through an extensive polar interface. The TMD of STEAP1 resembles the architecture of the STEAP4 TMD and exhibits cellular ferric reductase activity when fused to the NADPH-binding OxRD of STEAP4. A previous pioneering study reported the biophysical and electrochemical characterization of N-terminally truncated rabbit STEAP1, purified from insect cells in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol detergent (30Kim K. Mitra S. Wu G. Berka V. Song J. Yu Y. Poget S. Wang D.-N. Tsai A.-L. Zhou M. Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 1 (STEAP1) has a single b heme and is capable of reducing metal ion complexes and oxygen.Biochemistry. 2016; 55 (27792302): 6673-668410.1021/acs.biochem.6b00610Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our initial attempts to purify full-length, human STEAP1 from mammalian HEK cells using a similar protocol were hampered by the loss of the noncovalently bound heme B cofactor during the purification, suggesting that STEAP1 was not natively folded. Therefore, we screened several other detergents for the solubilization of STEAP1 and identified digitonin as a suitable replacement for lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol. In digitonin, the purified protein retained its heme cofactor (Fig. 1A) and eluted as a monodisperse peak in size-exclusion chromatography experiments (Fig. 1, B and D). In addition, thermostability assays revealed a melting temperature of ∼55.5 °C for STEAP1 in digitonin (Fig. 1, D and E), indicating that the protein was stable outside its native membrane environment. To assess whether the extracellular domains of purified STEAP1 adopted a conformation similar to those of membrane-embedded STEAP1, we tested the binding of STEAP1 to the Fab fragment of mAb120.545, which exhibits 1 nm affinity for STEAP1 on cells (5Challita-Eid P.M. Morrison K. Etessami S. An Z. Morrison K.J. Perez-Villar J.J. Raitano A.B. Jia X.C. Gudas J.M. Kanner S.B. Jakobovits A.

(February, 18, 2015) Antibodies and immunoconjugates and uses therefor. U.S. Patent EP2502938B1.Google Scholar). Size-exclusion chromatography assays revealed a smaller elution volume for STEAP1 when it was premixed with Fab120.545 (Fig. 1B), suggesting the formation of a complex, which was then confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis of the eluted sample (Fig. 1C). Thus, the conformation of the STEAP1 epitope recognized by the Fab fragment on cells is preserved during the detergent solubilization and purification of STEAP1. To gain insights into the molecular architecture of STEAP1, we set out to obtain a structural model of the protein using single-particle cryo-EM. Full-length, trimeric STEAP1 proved to be a challenging sample for EM due to its small size (<120 kDa) and the absence of folded domains protruding from the membrane region. To create a larger particle with more extramembrane features to facilitate EM image processing, we opted to determine the structure of STEAP1 purified in complex with Fab120.545. The complementarity-determining regions of Fab120.545 are identical to those present in STEAP1 antibodies used in clinical trials (Fig. S1), indicating that the structure of the STEAP1-Fab120.545 complex could also be useful in engineering antibodies and other molecules that target STEAP1 in cancer. Micrographs collected on a 200-kV Talos Arctica microscope showed nonaggregated particles distributed in vitreous ice (Fig. S2A). Subsequent 2D classification experiments yielded class averages with clear secondary structure elements and furthermore revealed that more than one Fab fragment is bound to micelle-embedded STEAP1 (Fig. 2A; Fig. S2B). Image processing in RELION (33Scheres S.H.W. RELION: implementation of a Bayesian approach to cryo-EM structure determination.J. Struct. Biol. 2012; 180 (23000701): 519-53010.1016/j.jsb.2012.09.006Crossref PubMed Scopus (3034) Google Scholar) finally resulted in a reconstructed cryo-EM-density map at ∼3.0-Å resolution (Fig. 2B; Fig. S2, C–F). The map displayed well-defined side chain density for the TMD of STEAP1 and the variable regions of the Fab (Fig. S3). The model for STEAP1 was built with the TMD of STEAP4 as the template (29Oosterheert W. van Bezouwen L.S. Rodenburg R.N.P. Granneman J. Förster F. Mattevi A. Gros P. Cryo-EM structures of human STEAP4 reveal mechanism of iron(III) reduction.Nat.

The refined structure has acceptable stereochemistry and exhibits high correlation to the cryo-EM density map within the determined resolution (Fig. S3, G and H; Table 1).Table 1Cryo-EM data collection, refinement, and validation statistics for STEAP1-Fab120.545 (PDB code 6Y9B, EMDB-10735)Data collection and processingMicroscopeTalos ArcticaCameraGatan K2 Summit + GIF filterMagnification×130,000Voltage (kV)200Frame/total exposure time (s)0.25/6.5No. of frames26Electron exposure (e−/Å2)49.5Defocus range (µm)−0.5 to −3.0Pixel size (Å)1.029Symmetry imposedC3No. of micrographs5,325No. of initial particle images616,302No. of final particles images169,426Map resolution (FSC = 0.143 threshold) (Å)2.97Map resolution range (Å)2.9–5.0RefinementModel resolution (FSC = 0.5 threshold) (Å)3.04Map sharpening B factor (Å2)0Model compositionNo. of nonhydrogen atoms11,889No. of protein residues1,434No. of ligands6B-factors (Å2)Protein100.5Ligands92.8RMSDBond lengths (Å)0.004Bond angles (°)0.536ValidationMolProbity score1.69Clash score5.08Poor rotamers (%)1.2Ramachandran plotFavored (%)94.6Allowed (%)5.4Disallowed (%)0 Open table in a new tab The cryo-EM structure reveals a 1:1 stoichiometry of the STEAP1-Fab120.545 complex, with 3 STEAP1 protomers interacting with 3 Fab molecules (Fig. 2, B–D). The Fabs bind at the extracellular region of STEAP1, consistent with the observation that the antibody targets STEAP1 expressed on intact cancer cells. The intracellular loops of STEAP1 extend ∼18 Å from the membrane region into the cytoplasm, whereas the Fabs protrude up to ∼75 Å into the extracellular space. STEAP1 adopts a trimeric arrangement that is similar to that of its family member STEAP4 (41% amino acid sequence identity; root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.8 Å for 640 Cα atoms) (Fig. 3). Each STEAP1 subunit contains six membrane-spanning α-helices (h1–h6) that define the TMD of the protein. A single B-type heme cofactor is surrounded by helices, h2, h3, h4, and h5 at the extracellular membrane leaflet (Fig. S3B). Strictly conserved histidine residues H175 and H268 coordinate the central iron moiety of the heme prosthetic group, thereby resembling the hexacoordinated heme arrangement of STEAP4. At the intracellular membrane leaflet side of the TMD, we observed weak density not corresponding to any protein residues. An overlay with the structure of STEAP4 revealed that the observed density overlaps with the flavin ring of the FAD-binding site in STEAP4 (Fig. S3D). The FAD-interacting residues in the TMD of STEAP3 and 4 are conserved in STEAP1, and the STEAP1-Fab120.545 cryo-EM sample was supplemented with 1 mm FAD before grid freezing.

https://openalex.org/W3025217136,"Here we focus on the highly conserved MYB-bHLH-WD repeat (MBW) transcriptional complex model in eggplant, which is pivotal in the transcriptional regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway. Through a genome-wide approach performed on the recently released Eggplant Genome (cv. 67/3) previously identified, and reconfirmed by us, members belonging to the MBW complex (SmelANT1, SmelAN2, SmelJAF13, SmelAN1) were functionally characterized. Furthermore, a regulatory R3 MYB type repressor (SmelMYBL1), never reported before, was identified and characterized as well. Through a qPCR approach, we revealed specific transcriptional patterns of candidate genes in different plant tissue/organs at two stages of fruit development. Two strategies were adopted for investigating the interactions of bHLH partners (SmelAN1, SmelJAF13) with MYB counterparts (SmelANT1, SmelAN2 and SmelMYBL1): Yeast Two Hybrid (Y2H) and Bimolecular Fluorescent Complementation (BiFC) in A. thaliana mesophylls protoplast. Agro-infiltration experiments highlighted that N. benthamiana leaves transiently expressing SmelANT1 and SmelAN2 showed an anthocyanin-pigmented phenotype, while their co-expression with SmelMYBL1 prevented anthocyanin accumulation. Our results suggest that SmelMYBL1 may inhibits the MBW complex via the competition with MYB activators for bHLH binding site, although this hypothesis requires further elucidation."
https://openalex.org/W3024687961,"Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) was first identified in the rodent prostate and is abundantly expressed in human and rodent prostate epithelium, stroma, immune cells and endothelium of the blood vessels. In the prostates of mice with inactivated ERβ, mutant phenotypes include epithelial hyperplasia and increased expression of androgen receptor (AR)-regulated genes, most of which are also upregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). ERβ is expressed in both basal and luminal cells in the prostate while AR is expressed in luminal but not in the basal cell layer which harbors the prostate stem cells. To investigate the mechanisms of action of ERβ and its potential cross-talk with AR, we used RNA-seq to study the effects of estradiol or the synthetic ligand, LY3201, in AR-positive LNCaP PCa cells which had been engineered to express ERβ. Transcriptomic analysis indicated relatively few changes in gene expression with ERβ overexpression, but robust responses following ligand treatments. There is significant overlap of responsive genes between the two ligands, estradiol and LY3201 as well as ligand-specific alterations. Gene set analysis of down-regulated genes identified an enrichment of androgen-responsive genes, such as FKBP5, CAMKK2, and TBC1D4. Consistently, AR transcript, protein levels, and transcriptional activity were down-regulated following ERβ activation. In agreement with this, we find that the phosphorylation of the CAMKK2 target, AMPK, was repressed by ligand-activated ERβ. These findings suggest that ERβ-mediated signaling pathways are involved in the negative regulation of AR expression and activity, thus supporting a tumor suppressive role for ERβ in PCa."
https://openalex.org/W3025031765,"Multisubunit-tethering complexes (MTCs) are large (250 to >750 kDa), conserved macromolecular machines that are essential for soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE)-mediated membrane fusion in all eukaryotes. MTCs are thought to organize membrane trafficking by mediating the initial long-range interaction between a vesicle and its target membrane and promoting the formation of membrane-bridging SNARE complexes. Previously, we reported the structure of the yeast Dsl1 complex, the simplest known MTC, which is essential for coat protein I (COPI) mediated transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This structure suggests how the Dsl1 complex might tether a vesicle to its target membrane by binding at one end to the COPI coat and at the other to ER-associated SNAREs. Here, we used X-ray crystallography to investigate these Dsl1-SNARE interactions in greater detail. The Dsl1 complex comprises three subunits that together form a two-legged structure with a central hinge. We found that distal regions of each leg bind N-terminal Habc domains of the ER SNAREs Sec20 (a Qb-SNARE) and Use1 (a Qc-SNARE). The observed binding modes appear to anchor the Dsl1 complex to the ER target membrane while simultaneously ensuring that both SNAREs are in open conformations, with their SNARE motifs available for assembly. The proximity of the two SNARE motifs, and therefore their ability to enter the same SNARE complex, will depend on the relative orientation of the two Dsl1 legs. These results underscore the critical roles of SNARE N-terminal domains in mediating interactions with other elements of the vesicle docking and fusion machinery."
https://openalex.org/W3025035929,"Bone marrow stroma influences metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) progression, latency, and recurrence. At sites of PCa bone metastasis, cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages interact to establish a perlecan-rich desmoplastic stroma. As a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, perlecan (HSPG2) stores and stabilizes growth factors, including heparin-binding Wnt3A, a positive regulator of PCa cell growth. Because PCa cells alone do not induce CAF production of perlecan in the desmoplastic stroma, we sought to discover the sources of perlecan and its growth factor-releasing modifiers SULF1, SULF2, and heparanase in PCa cells and xenografts, bone marrow fibroblasts, and macrophages. SULF1, produced primarily by bone marrow fibroblasts, was the main glycosaminoglycanase present, a finding validated with primary tissue specimens of PCa metastases with desmoplastic bone stroma. Expression of both HSPG2 and SULF1 was concentrated in αSMA-rich stroma near PCa tumor nests, where infiltrating pro-tumor TAMs also were present. To decipher SULF1's role in the reactive bone stroma, we created a bone marrow biomimetic hydrogel incorporating perlecan, PCa cells, macrophages, and fibroblastic bone marrow stromal cells. Finding that M2-like macrophages increased levels of SULF1 and HSPG2 produced by fibroblasts, we examined SULF1 function in Wnt3A-mediated PCa tumoroid growth in tricultures. Comparing control or SULF1 knockout fibroblastic cells, we showed that SULF1 reduces Wnt3A-driven growth, cellularity, and cluster number of PCa cells in our 3D model. We conclude that SULF1 can suppress Wnt3A-driven growth signals in the desmoplastic stroma of PCa bone metastases, and SULF1 loss favors PCa progression, even in the presence of pro-tumorigenic TAMs."
https://openalex.org/W3025344511,"Since 2000, human malaria cases in Malaysia were rapidly reduced with the use of insecticides in Indoor Residual Spray (IRS) and Long-Lasting Insecticide Net (LLIN). Unfortunately, monkey malaria in humans has shown an increase especially in Sabah and Sarawak. The insecticide currently used in IRS is deltamethrin K-Othrine® WG 250 wettable granule, targeting mosquitoes that rest and feed indoor. In Sabah, the primary vector for knowlesi malaria is An. balabacensis a species known to bite outdoor. This study evaluates an alternative method, the Outdoor Residual Spray (ORS) using a novel formulation of deltamethrin K-Othrine® (PolyZone) to examine it suitability to control knowlesi malaria vector in Sabah, compared to the current method. The study was performed at seven villages in Sabah having similar type of houses (wood, bamboo and concrete). Houses were sprayed with deltamethrin K-Othrine® (PolyZone) at two different dosages, 25 mg/m2 and 30 mg/m2 and deltamethrin K-Othrine® WG 250 wettable granule at 25 mg/m2, sprayed indoor and outdoor. Residual activity on different walls was assessed using standard cone bioassay techniques. For larval surveillances, potential breeding sites were surveyed. Larvae were collected and identified, pre and post spraying. Adult survey was done using Human Landing Catch (HLC) performed outdoor and indoor. Detection of malaria parasite in adults was conducted via microscopy and molecular methods. Deltamethrin K-Othrine® (PolyZone) showed higher efficacy when sprayed outdoor. The efficacy was found varied when sprayed on different types of wall surfaces. Deltamethrin K-Othrine® (PolyZone) at 25 mg/m2 was the most effective with regards to ability to high mortality and effective knock down (KD). The vector population was reduced significantly post-spraying and reduction in breeding sites as well. The number of simian malaria infected vector, human and simian malaria transmission were also greatly reduced."
https://openalex.org/W3025482390,"The vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an ATP-dependent proton pump that is essential for cellular homeostasis. V-ATPase activity is controlled by the regulated assembly of the enzyme from its component V1 and V0 domains. We previously reported that amino acid starvation rapidly increases V-ATPase assembly and activity in mammalian lysosomes, but the signaling pathways controlling this effect are unknown. In testing inhibitors of pathways important for controlling cellular metabolism, we found here that the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) inhibitor H89 increases lysosomal V-ATPase activity and blocks any further change upon starvation. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor dorsomorphin decreased lysosomal V-ATPase activity and also blocked any increase upon starvation. However, CRISPR-mediated gene editing revealed that PKA and AMPK are not required for the starvation-dependent increase in lysosomal V-ATPase activity, indicating that H89 and dorsomorphin modify V-ATPase activity through other cellular targets. We next found that the AKT Ser/Thr kinase (AKT) inhibitor MK2206 blocks the starvation-dependent increase in lysosomal V-ATPase activity without altering basal activity. Expression of AKT1 or AKT3, but not AKT2, was required for increased lysosomal V-ATPase activity in response to amino acid starvation in mouse fibroblasts. Finally, HEK293T cells expressing only AKT1 responded normally to starvation, whereas cells expressing only AKT2 displayed a significantly reduced increase in V-ATPase activity and assembly upon starvation.

Amino acid homeostasis, which involves balancing the production and utilization of free amino acids, is essential to cellular and organismal viability. To achieve homeostasis, cells must continually sense amino acid availability and respond accordingly. A major way that cells replenish the available supply of amino acids is through lysosomal proteolysis, which depends upon the low lumenal pH generated by vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). The V-ATPase is an ATP-dependent proton pump that functions to transport protons from the cytosol into various intracellular compartments or across the plasma membrane of specialized cells (1Forgac M.

V-ATPase–dependent acidification is essential for a variety of cellular processes. Acidification of early endosomes promotes ligand/receptor dissociation, which is important for signal termination and receptor recycling (5Maxfield F.R. McGraw T.E. Endocytic recycling.Nat. Rev. Mol.

The formation of endosomal carrier vesicles is also pH-dependent, as is autophagosome/lysosome fusion (7Gu F. Gruenberg J. ARF1 regulates pH-dependent COP functions in the early endocytic pathway.J.

Degradation of lysosomal contents depends on the activation of acid-dependent proteases. Finally, the proton gradient generated by the V-ATPase drives the coupled transport of small molecules, such as amino acids, out of the lysosome (9Xu H. Ren D. Lysosomal physiology.Annu. Rev.

Because these various processes occur within discrete pH ranges, the activity of the V-ATPase is highly regulated. The V-ATPase is composed of two multisubunit domains: the peripheral V1 domain that hydrolyzes ATP and the integral V0 domain that transports protons (1Forgac M. Vacuolar ATPases: rotary proton pumps in physiology and pathophysiology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8 (17912264): 917-92910.1038/nrm2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 2Kane P.M.

V-ATPase activity is controlled by reversible dissociation of the V1 and V0 domains, a process termed regulated assembly, where both the catalytic and transport functions of the enzyme are inhibited upon disassembly (1Forgac M.

Regulated assembly also occurs in mammalian cells, but the stimuli and signaling pathways controlling it are not the same as those in yeast. In mammalian cells, elevated glucose causes increased V-ATPase assembly and activity via the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway (13Sautin Y.Y. Lu M. Gaugler A. Zhang L. Gluck S.L.

Moreover, we recently reported that acute glucose starvation also increases V-ATPase assembly and lysosomal activity in mammalian cells, and that inhibitors of PI3K/AKT and AMPK block this effect (14McGuire C.M.

This was the first demonstration of AMPK control of assembly in any system, while PI3K is known to be important for increasing assembly in cells infected with influenza virus and in dendritic cells upon maturation (15Marjuki H.

Interestingly, unlike the examples discussed above, inhibition of either PI3K or one of its major effectors, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), failed to block the increase in assembly and lysosomal acidification upon amino acid starvation (17Stransky L.A.

In the present study, we sought to identify the pathways controlling V-ATPase–dependent lysosomal acidification in response to amino acid starvation. Using a combination of pharmacological and genetic approaches, we find that the PKA inhibitor H89 and the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin alter V-ATPase-dependent lysosomal acidification through off-target effects. In contrast, results using the AKT inhibitor MK2206 and genetic analysis demonstrate that AKT is important for controlling lysosomal V-ATPase activity upon amino acid starvation. AKT, also known as protein kinase B (PKB), is a serine/threonine kinase with diverse substrates that functions to promote survival, growth, and other anabolic processes (18Manning B.D. Toker A.

We now report that AKT1 or AKT3, but not AKT2, is required for the increase in V-ATPase–dependent lysosomal acidification in response to amino acid withdrawal. We previously reported that in mammalian cells, amino acid starvation increases V-ATPase assembly and lysosomal V-ATPase activity independently of PI3K or its major effector, mTORC1 (17Stransky L.A.

To test the role of the PKA pathway, we first determined the minimum concentration of the PKA inhibitor H89 necessary to inhibit forskolin-induced, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) (21Horstrup K.

We next tested the effect of H89 on lysosomal V-ATPase activity in HEK293T cells maintained in amino acids or starved for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 1B, H89 significantly increases basal lysosomal V-ATPase activity and blocks any further changes to activity upon amino acid starvation. This suggested that PKA is important for controlling the steady-state level of lysosomal V-ATPase activity in mammalian cells and, possibly, the response to amino acid starvation. To test the involvement of the AMPK pathway, we first determined the minimum concentration of the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin necessary to inhibit AMPK in HEK293T cells, as measured by phosphorylation of the AMPK substrate acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (22Ha J. Daniel S. Broyles S.S. Kim K.H. Critical phosphorylation sites for acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271 (7915280): 1385-2216810.1074/jbc.271.3.1385PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, dorsomorphin markedly reduces ACC phosphorylation, although, consistent with other reports, some AMPK activity appears to remain, even at high drug concentrations (23Vogt J. Traynor R. Sapkota G.P. The specificities of small molecule inhibitors of the TGFβ and BMP pathways.Cell Signal. 2011; 23: 1831-184210.1016/j.cellsig.2011.06.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, we selected 5 μm as the lowest dose at which maximal inhibition of ACC phosphorylation occurs. As shown in Fig. 1D, 5 μm dorsomorphin markedly reduces lysosomal V-ATPase activity and blocks the increase upon amino acid starvation, suggesting AMPK is important both for maintaining basal V-ATPase activity and for increasing activity during starvation. H89 and dorsomorphin were found to modulate lysosomal V-ATPase activity in the presence and absence of amino acids, suggesting PKA and AMPK regulate V-ATPase activity both under basal conditions and in response to starvation. However, because these compounds are known to have numerous off-target effects (23Vogt J. Traynor R. Sapkota G.P. The specificities of small molecule inhibitors of the TGFβ and BMP pathways.Cell Signal. 2011; 23: 1831-184210.1016/j.cellsig.2011.06.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 24Bain J.

J. 2007; 408 (17850214): 297-31510.1042/BJ20070797Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar), we wished to confirm these results with genetic disruption of PKA and AMPK. We chose to functionally disrupt PKA and AMPK by targeting the genes encoding their respective catalytic subunits using CRISPR-mediated genome editing. The PKA catalytic subunit has two main isoforms: PKA Cα, encoded by PRKACA, and PKA Cβ, encoded by PRKACB (25Turnham R.E. Scott J.D. Protein kinase A catalytic subunit isoform PRKACA; history, function and physiology.Gene. 2016; 577 (26687711): 101-10810.1016/j.gene.2015.11.052Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To disrupt PKA, we first transfected HEK293T cells with a plasmid containing the Cas9 nuclease, an enhanced GFP reporter, and guide sequences targeting PRKACA. Individual GFP-positive cells were sorted by FACS, and clonal populations were expanded. Multiple clones were derived and tested for knockout of PKA Cα by Western blotting. A successful PKA Cα knockout clone then was subjected to a second round of CRISPR to knock out PKA Cβ. Successful deletion of both PKA Cα and Cβ was confirmed in multiple clones by Western blotting (Fig. 2A). PKA function was then probed by stimulating cells with the PKA activator forskolin, and PKA activity was monitored by phosphorylation of VASP. As shown in Fig. 2B, PKA Cα/Cβ double knockout cells have nearly undetectable levels of phospho-VASP, even after forskolin stimulation. We next tested the ability of PKA Cα/Cβ double knockout cells to show increased V-ATPase activity upon amino acid starvation. Surprisingly, the PKA Cα/Cβ double knockout clones are unaffected in their ability to show increased lysosomal V-ATPase activity upon amino acid starvation (Fig. 2C), suggesting that PKA is not required for this effect. Furthermore, PKA Cα/Cβ double knockout clones do not exhibit a significantly different level of basal lysosomal V-ATPase activity compared with WT HEK293T cells (Fig. 2D). This suggests that PKA does not function to suppress lysosomal V-ATPase activity under basal conditions. Finally, H89 increased lysosomal V-ATPase activity in a PKA Cα/Cβ double knockout clone, further indicating that H89 modulates V-ATPase activity independently of its effect as a PKA inhibitor (Fig. 2E). We used a similar double knockout approach to disrupt AMPK. The AMPK catalytic subunit has two isoforms: AMPKα1, encoded by PRKAA1, and AMPKα2, encoded by PRKAA2 (26Herzig S. Shaw R.J. AMPK: guardian of metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2018; 19: 121-13510.1038/nrm.2017.95Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). We confirmed knockouts by Western blotting using isoform-specific antibodies and also confirmed that phosphorylation of ACC was nearly undetectable in AMPKα1/α2 double knockout cells (Fig. 3A). Surprisingly, AMPKα1/α2 double knockouts are also unaffected in their ability to show increased lysosomal V-ATPase activity in response to starvation, suggesting that AMPK also is not required for this effect (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the AMPKα1/α2 double knockout clone did not have reduced basal lysosomal V-ATPase activity relative to that of WT cells (Fig. 3C). We also found that dorsomorphin reduced lysosomal V-ATPase activity in this AMPKα1/α2 double knockout clone, further indicating that dorsomorphin modulates V-ATPase activity independently of its effect as an AMPK inhibitor (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these results demonstrate that PKA and AMPK are not required for amino acid-dependent changes in lysosomal V-ATPase activity. We next tested inhibitors of other signaling pathways that have been implicated in controlling V-ATPase activity. Interestingly, while the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 does not prevent the starvation-dependent increase in V-ATPase activity (17Stransky L.A. Forgac M. Amino Acid Availability Modulates Vacuolar H+-ATPase Assembly.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (26378229): 27360-2736910.1074/jbc.M115.659128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the AKT inhibitor MK2206 was found to block the response to starvation (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that AKT is important in controlling the starvation-dependent increase in V-ATPase activity despite the fact that no starvation-dependent change in AKT activity (as measured by phospho-AKT Western blotting) is observed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 4B). We next sought to test the function of AKT in amino acid-dependent changes in V-ATPase activity genetically. AKT triple knockout cells do not proliferate and, therefore, are not suitable for cell culture (27Sanidas I. Polytarchou C. Hatziapostolou M. Ezell S.A. Kottakis F. Hu L. Guo A. Xie J. Comb M.J. Iliopoulos D. Tsichlis P.N. Phosphoproteomics screen reveals akt isoform-specific signals linking RNA processing to lung cancer.Mol.

However, murine lung fibroblasts have been generated that lack endogenous AKT and instead express one of each of the three individual human AKT isoforms (28Iliopoulos D. Polytarchou C. Hatziapostolou M. Kottakis F. Maroulakou I.G. Struhl K. Tsichlis P.N. MicroRNAs differentially regulated by Akt isoforms control EMT and stem cell renewal in cancer cells.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra6210.1126/scisignal.2000356Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), as confirmed by Western blotting using isoform-specific AKT antibodies (Fig. 4C). We tested the ability of these AKT knockout fibroblasts to display increased lysosomal V-ATPase activity upon amino acid starvation. Interestingly, cells expressing only AKT1 or AKT3 exhibit the same 1.5-fold increase in V-ATPase activity observed with the WT HEK293T cells upon starvation (Fig. 4D). In contrast, fibroblasts expressing only AKT2 show no increase in V-ATPase activity in response to amino acid starvation. These results suggest that AKT is important for controlling lysosomal V-ATPase activity in response to changes in amino acid availability, and that this dependence is specific to particular isoforms of AKT. We next sought to further confirm our finding that particular AKT isoforms are important for controlling lysosomal V-ATPase activity in response to amino acid starvation. Because the mouse fibroblasts tested overexpress human AKT isoforms, we wished to test human cells expressing endogenous levels of AKT. Interestingly, Western blot analysis indicates that HEK293T cells express only AKT1 and AKT2 but lack AKT3 (Fig. 4C). Since fibroblasts expressing only AKT2 show no starvation-dependent increase in V-ATPase activity, we hypothesized that knocking out AKT1 in HEK293T cells (leaving only AKT2 intact) would block this response, whereas knocking out AKT2 (leaving only AKT1 intact) would have no effect. We targeted the AKT1 and AKT2 genes separately by CRISPR and confirmed, by Western blotting, the absence of the corresponding isoform in multiple independently derived clones (Fig. 5A). As further shown in Fig. 5A, there does not appear to be any substantial compensation by overexpression of other isoforms (including AKT3) in any of the derived clones. We next tested the effect of amino acid starvation on lysosomal V-ATPase activity in the AKT knockout clones. As shown in Fig. 5B, AKT2 knockout cells show a normal starvation-dependent increase in lysosomal V-ATPase activity relative to WT cells. In contrast, all AKT1 knockout clones tested have a greatly diminished response of lysosomal V-ATPase activity to starvation. Four clones showed no significant increase in V-ATPase activity upon starvation, while in four other clones the increase was significantly lower than that in WT cells. Thus, the mean V-ATPase activity upon starvation relative to the unstarved condition was 1.64 ± 0.02 in WT cells, 1.64 ± 0.09 in the negative-control clones, 1.14 ± 0.07 in AKT1 knockout clones, and 1.75 ± 0.09 in AKT2 knockout clones. Since it is possible that the lack of a starvation-dependent increase in activity is due to elevated basal activity in the AKT1 knockout cells, we also analyzed basal activity relative to WT cells. As shown in Fig. 5C, there is variability in basal activity among all groups, including the negative-control clones, although mean basal activities were quite similar to those of the WT. Thus, the mean basal lysosomal V-ATPase activity, relative to the WT, was 1.08 ± 0.12 in the negative control clones, 1.08 ± 0.08 in the AKT1 knockout clones, and 1.01 ± 0.09 in the AKT2 knockout clones. Importantly, among the four AKT1 knockout clones that showed no significant increase in V-ATPase activity upon starvation, no clone had a basal activity higher than 0.98 relative to the WT. Thus, for these clones, the lack of a starvation-dependent increase in lysosomal V-ATPase activity was not due to elevated basal activity. We next wished to test whether the reduced response of lysosomal V-ATPase activity observed in the AKT1 knockout clones was due to an attenuated increase in V-ATPase assembly. To measure V-ATPase assembly, Western blotting was performed on membrane and cytosolic fractions isolated from cells that had either been maintained in amino acids or starved for 1 h. Because the peripheral V1 domain is only present in membranes in fully assembled V-ATPase complexes, the abundance of V1 subunits in the membrane fraction reflects the level of V-ATPase assembly (14McGuire C.M. Forgac M. Glucose starvation increases V-ATPase assembly and activity in mammalian cells through AMP kinase and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling.J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 6, amino acid starvation led to significantly increased assembly in WT HEK293T cells and an AKT2 knockout clone, while there was no significant change in the AKT1 knockout clone. Since it is possible that the lack of a starvation-dependent increase in assembly is due to elevated basal assembly in the AKT1 knockout cells, we also analyzed basal assembly relative to WT cells. As shown in Fig. 6C, the AKT1 knockout clone did have significantly increased basal assembly relative to the WT, while the AKT2 knockout clone did not. This suggests that increased basal assembly may contribute to the failure to show increased V-ATPase assembly upon amino acid starvation in this AKT1 knockout clone. These results, taken collectively with data from the AKT knockout fibroblasts and the effect of the AKT inhibitor MK2206, demonstrate that AKT is involved in the starvation-dependent increase in lysosomal V-ATPase activity and assembly, and that this involvement depends upon the isoform of AKT expressed. Amino acid sensing is essential to cellular homeostasis, and the V-ATPase has emerged as a central component of the amino acid sensing machinery in mammalian cells (29Collins M.P. Forgac M.

https://openalex.org/W3024944091,"Cyanobacterial Hox is a [NiFe] hydrogenase that consists of the hydrogen (H2)-activating subunits HoxYH, which form a complex with the HoxEFU assembly to mediate reactions with soluble electron carriers like NAD(P)H and ferredoxin (Fdx), thereby coupling photosynthetic electron transfer to energy-transforming catalytic reactions. Researchers studying the HoxEFUYH complex have observed that HoxEFU can be isolated independently of HoxYH, leading to the hypothesis that HoxEFU is a distinct functional subcomplex rather than an artifact of Hox complex isolation. Moreover, outstanding questions about the reactivity of Hox with natural substrates and the site(s) of substrate interactions and coupling of H2, NAD(P)H, and Fdx remain to be resolved. To address these questions, here we analyzed recombinantly produced HoxEFU by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and kinetic assays with natural substrates. The purified HoxEFU subcomplex catalyzed electron transfer reactions among NAD(P)H, flavodoxin, and several ferredoxins, thus functioning in vitro as a shuttle among different cyanobacterial pools of reducing equivalents. Both Fdx1-dependent reductions of NAD+ and NADP+ were cooperative. HoxEFU also catalyzed the flavodoxin-dependent reduction of NAD(P)+, Fdx2-dependent oxidation of NADH and Fdx4- and Fdx11-dependent reduction of NAD+. MS-based mapping identified an Fdx1-binding site at the junction of HoxE and HoxF, adjacent to iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters in both subunits. Overall, the reactivity of HoxEFU observed here suggests that it functions in managing peripheral electron flow from photosynthetic electron transfer, findings that reveal detailed insights into how ubiquitous cellular components may be used to allocate energy flow into specific bioenergetic products."
https://openalex.org/W3025233731,"Comparative severity assessment of animal models and experimental interventions is of utmost relevance for harm-benefit analysis during ethical evaluation, an animal welfare-based model prioritization as well as the validation of refinement measures. Unfortunately, there is a lack of evidence-based approaches to grade an animal’s burden in a sensitive, robust, precise, and objective manner. Particular challenges need to be considered in the context of animal-based neuroscientific research because models of neurological disorders can be characterized by relevant changes in the affective state of an animal. Here, we report about an approach for parameter selection and development of a composite measure scheme designed for precise analysis of the distress of animals in a specific model category. Data sets from the analysis of several behavioral and biochemical parameters in three different epilepsy models were subjected to a principal component analysis to select the most informative parameters. The top-ranking parameters included burrowing, open field locomotion, social interaction, and saccharin preference. These were combined to create a composite measure scheme (CMS). CMS data were subjected to cluster analysis enabling the allocation of severity levels to individual animals. The results provided information for a direct comparison between models indicating a comparable severity of the electrical and chemical post-status epilepticus models, and a lower severity of the kindling model. The new CMS can be directly applied for comparison of other rat models with seizure activity or for assessment of novel refinement approaches in the respective research field. The respective online tool for direct application of the CMS or for creating a new CMS based on other parameters from different models is available at https://github.com/mytalbot/cms. However, the robustness and generalizability needs to be further assessed in future studies. More importantly, our concept of parameter selection can serve as a practice example providing the basis for comparable approaches applicable to the development and validation of CMS for all kinds of disease models or interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3025607118,"Accuracy of glioma grading is fundamental for the diagnosis, treatment planning and prognosis of patients. The purpose of this work was to develop a low-cost and easy-to-implement classification model which distinguishes low-grade gliomas (LGGs) from high-grade gliomas (HGGs), through texture analysis applied to conventional brain MRI. Different combinations of MRI contrasts (T1Gd and T2) and one segmented glioma region (necrotic and non-enhancing tumor core, NCR/NET) were studied. Texture features obtained from the gray level size zone matrix (GLSZM) were calculated. An under-sampling method was proposed to divide the data into different training subsets and subsequently extract complementary information for the creation of distinct classification models. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the models were calculated, and the best model explicitly reported. The best model included only three texture features and reached a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 94.12%, 88.24% and 91.18%, respectively. According to the features of the model, when the NCR/NET region was studied, HGGs had a more heterogeneous texture than LGGs in the T1Gd images, and LGGs had a more heterogeneous texture than HGGs in the T2 images. These novel results partially contrast with results from the literature. The best model proved to be useful for the classification of gliomas. Complementary results showed that the heterogeneity of gliomas depended on the MRI contrast studied. The chosen model stands out as a simple, low-cost, easy-to-implement, reproducible and highly accurate glioma classifier. Importantly, it should be accessible to populations with reduced economic and scientific resources."
https://openalex.org/W3024172711,"A growing body of literature acknowledges the association between negative stereotypes and individual components of active aging, but very few studies have tested this association, at both individual and population levels. The Stereotypes Content Model (SCM) states that the cultural aging stereotyping of higher warmth than competence (called paternalistic or ambivalent prejudice) is universal. Our aims in this study are to test the extent to which the universality of this stereotype is confirmed in European Countries as well as how far ""positive"", ""negative"" or ""ambivalent"" views towards older people, and other negative attitudes such as prejudice and behaviours such as discrimination, predict active aging assessed both at individual and population levels. We have analyzed data from the European Social Survey-2008 (ESS-2008), containing SCM stereotypical and other appraisal items (such as direct prejudice and perceived discrimination) about adults aged over-70 from 29 European countries. First, SCM cultural stereotypes about older adults (“friendly”, “competent”, and “ambivalent”) were calculated; secondly, after developing a typology of countries based on their “negative”, “ambivalent” and “positive” views about older adults, the universality of cultural stereotypes was tested; thirdly, taking into consideration ESS data of those older persons (over 70s) who self-reported indicators of active aging (health, happiness, satisfaction and social participation), multilevel analyses were performed, taking our inter-individual measure of active aging as dependent variable and our stereotypical classification (positive/negative/ambivalent), direct prejudice and perceived discrimination as predictors; finally, relationships between stereotypical and appraisal items on older adults were examined at population level with country data from Active Aging Indexes. Our results show cultural stereotypes about older people (more friendly than competent) are widespread in most European countries, and negative cultural views of older adults are negatively associated with active aging both at individual and population level, supporting that negative cultural views of older adults could be considered as a threat to active aging."
https://openalex.org/W3024447651,"At present, many researchers see hope that artificial intelligence, machine learning in particular, will improve several aspects of the everyday life for individuals, cities and whole nations alike. For example, it has been speculated that the so-called machine learning could soon relieve employees of part of the duties, which may improve processes or help to find the most effective ways of performing tasks. Consequently, in the long run, it would help to enhance employees' work-life balance. Thus, workers' overall quality of life would improve, too. However, what would happen if machine learning as such were employed to try and find the ways of achieving work-life balance? This is why the authors of the paper decided to utilize a machine learning tool to search for the factors that influence the subjective feeling of one's work-life balance. The possible results could help to predict and prevent the occurrence of work-life imbalance in the future. In order to do so, the data provided by an exceptionally sizeable group of 800 employees was utilised; it was one of the largest sample groups in similar studies in Poland so far. Additionally, this was one of the first studies where so many employees had been analysed using an artificial neural network. In order to enable replicability of the study, the specific setup of the study and the description of the dataset are provided. Having analysed the data and having conducted several experiments, the correlations between some factors and work-life balance have indeed been identified: it has been found that the most significant was the relation between the feeling of balance and the actual working hours; shifting it resulted in the tool predicting the switch from balance to imbalance, and vice versa. Other factors that proved significant for the predicted WLB are the amount of free time a week the employee has for themselves, working at weekends only, being self-employed and the subjective assessment of one's financial status. In the study the dataset gets balanced, the most important features are selected with the selectKbest algorithm, an artificial neural network of 2 hidden layers with 50 and 25 neurons, ReLU and ADAM is constructed and trained on 90% of the dataset. In tests, it predicts WLB based on the prepared dataset and selected features with 81% accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3024927906,"Shiga toxin (STx) is a virulence factor produced by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli. STx is taken up by mammalian host cells by binding to the glycosphingolipid (GSL) globotriaosylceramide (Gb3; Galα1-4Galβ1-4Glc-ceramide) and causes cell death after its retrograde membrane transport. However, the contribution of the hydrophobic portion of Gb3 (ceramide) to STx transport remains unclear. In pigeons, blood group P1 glycan antigens (Galα1-4Galβ1-4GlcNAc-) are expressed on glycoproteins that are synthesized by α1,4-galactosyltransferase 2 (pA4GalT2). To examine whether these glycoproteins can also function as STx receptors, here we constructed glycan-remodeled HeLa cell variants lacking Gb3 expression but instead expressing pA4GalT2-synthesized P1 glycan antigens on glycoproteins. We compared STx binding and sensitivity of these variants with those of the parental, Gb3-expressing HeLa cells. The glycan-remodeled cells bound STx1 via N-glycans of glycoproteins and were sensitive to STx1 even without Gb3 expression, indicating that P1-containing glycoproteins also function as STx receptors. However, these variants were significantly less sensitive to STx than the parent cells. Fluorescence microscopy and correlative light EM revealed that the STx1 B subunit accumulates to lower levels in the Golgi apparatus after glycoprotein-mediated than after Gb3-mediated uptake but instead accumulates in vacuole-like structures probably derived from early endosomes. Furthermore, coexpression of Galα1-4Gal on both glycoproteins and GSLs reduced the sensitivity of cells to STx1 compared with those expressing Galα1-4Gal only on GSLs, probably because of competition for STx binding or internalization. We conclude that lipid-based receptors are much more effective in STx retrograde transport and mediate greater STx cytotoxicity than protein-based receptors."

Studies of the association between concurrent objective measures of sleep, physical activity, and metabolic risk factors among adolescents are limited.The aim of the study was to examine the association between metabolic risk factors and objectively measured school day physical activity and sleep duration, quality, onset, and variability in adolescents.We measured one school week of free-living sleep and physical activity with wrist actigraphy in 252 adolescents (146 girls), aged 15.8±0.3 years. Metabolic risk factors included body mass index, waist circumference, total body and trunk fat percentage, resting blood pressure, and fasting glucose and insulin levels. Multiple linear regression adjusted for sex, parental education, and day length was used to assess associations between metabolic risk factors and sleep and activity parameters.On average, participants went to bed at 00:22±0.88 hours and slept 6.2±0.7 hours/night, with 0.83±0.36 hours of awakenings/night. However, night-to-night variability in sleep duration was considerable (mean ± interquartile range) 0.75±0.55 hours) and bedtime (0.64±0.53 hours) respectively. Neither average sleep duration nor mean bedtime was associated with any metabolic risk factors. However, greater night-to-night variability in sleep duration and bedtime was associated with higher total body and trunk fat percentage, and less physical activity was associated with higher trunk fat percentage and insulin levels.Greater nightly variation in sleep duration and in bedtime and less physical activity were associated with a less favorable metabolic profile in adolescents. These findings support the idea that, along with an adequate amount of physical activity, a regular sleep schedule is important for the metabolic health of adolescents."

Material and methods Normal development was studied in WntCre reporter mice (E10.0–12.5) for neural crest cells and Nkx2.5 immunostaining for second heart field cells. Data were compared to stage matched human embryos and a VEGF120/120 mutant mouse strain developing pulmonary atresia. Results Normal mouse and human embryos showed that the mid-pharyngeal endothelial plexus, connected side-ways to the 6th pharyngeal arch artery. The ventral segment formed the proximal pulmonary artery. The dorsal segment (future DA) was solely surrounded by neural crest cells. The ventral segment had a dual outer lining with neural crest and second heart field cells, while the distal pulmonary artery was covered by none of these cells. The asymmetric contribution of second heart field to the future pulmonary trunk on the left side of the aortic sac (so-called pulmonary push) was evident. The ventral segment became incorporated into the pulmonary trunk leading to a separate connection of the left and right pulmonary arteries. The VEGF120/120 embryos showed a stunted pulmonary push and a variety of vascular anomalies. Summary Side-way connection of the DA to the left pulmonary artery is a congenital anomaly. The primary problem is a stunted development of the pulmonary push leading to pulmonary stenosis/atresia and a subsequent lack of proper incorporation of the ventral segment into the aortic sac. Clinically, the aberrant smooth muscle tissue of the ductus arteriosus should be addressed to prohibit development of severe pulmonary ductal coarctation or even interruption of the left pulmonary artery."

Focusing on the alternansucrase (ASR) from Leuconostoc citreum NRRL B-1355, a well-known glucansucrase catalyzing the synthesis of both high- and low-molar-mass alternans, we searched for structural traits in ASR that could be involved in the control of alternan elongation. The resolution of five crystal structures of a truncated ASR version (ASRΔ2) in complex with different gluco-oligosaccharides pinpointed key residues in binding sites located in the A and V domains of ASR. Biochemical characterization of three single mutants and three double mutants targeting the sugar-binding pockets identified in domain V revealed an involvement of this domain in alternan binding and elongation. More strikingly, we found an oligosaccharide-binding site at the surface of domain A, distant from the catalytic site and not previously identified in other glucansucrases. We named this site surface-binding site (SBS) A1. Among the residues lining the SBS-A1 site, two (Gln700 and Tyr717) promoted alternan elongation. Their substitution to alanine decreased high-molar-mass alternan yield by a third, without significantly impacting enzyme stability or specificity.

The panel of polymers produced by glucansucrases varies dramatically in terms of size, type, and arrangement of α-glycosidic linkages and degree of branching, with all these features defining polymer structural properties and, consequently, the range of ongoing or potential applications. Among them, dextran, an α-1,6-linked glucan, was the first microbial polymer to be commercialized and used as plasma substitute (4Moulis C. André I. Remaud-Siméon M.

Other applications of α-glucans are mainly in the biomedical and analytical fields, but they are also used as thickening agents for food and cosmetics or as flocculants for ore mining (5Leemhuis H.

Recently, the α-1,3-linked α-glucan named mutan was proposed to be used for biomaterial applications (7Dennes, T. J., Perticone, A. M., and Paullin, J.

To produce size-defined α-glucans directly from sucrose and avoid fractionation steps, it seems essential to identify the molecular determinants involved in the control of polymer size. Since 2010, the 3D structure resolution of five different glucansucrases established that they all adopt a U-shaped fold made up by four domains (A, B, C, and IV), which are flanked by an additional domain V (9Vujičić-Žagar A.

Surprisingly, additional surface (or secondary) binding sites more distant from the active site were never described in the domains A, B, or IV of GH70 dextransucrases, contrary to what was observed for GH13 enzymes, which belong to the same clan as the GH70 enzymes and for which the distant surface-binding sites were found to play a role in substrate targeting, allosteric regulation, and also processivity (20Cuyvers S.

Given the structural diversity of α-glucans, we wondered whether the role of sugar-binding pockets in the synthesis of HMM dextran could be generalized to all glucansucrases, especially those producing polymers with a structure very different from that of dextran. With this in mind, we focused on the recombinant alternansucrase (ASR) from the L. mesenteroides NRRL B-1355 strain, recently reclassified as L. citreum (25Bounaix M.-S. Gabriel V. Robert H. Morel S. Remaud-Siméon M. Gabriel B. Fontagné-Faucher C. Characterization of glucan-producing Leuconostoc strains isolated from sourdough.Int. J. Food Microbiol. 2010; 144 (20591521): 1-910.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.05.026Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which stands out as a distinct GH70 glucansucrase synthesizing a polysaccharide made of alternating α-1,3- and α-1,6-linkages, named “alternan” (26Côté G.L.

From sucrose, ASR catalyzes the synthesis of a bimodal population of alternan, one of high molar mass (∼1,700,000 g mol−1) and one of much lower molar mass (1300 g mol−1) (27Joucla G. Pizzut S.

These two populations are formed during the early stage of the reaction, suggesting that ASR follows a semi-processive mechanism of polymerization involving polymer anchoring regions in the enzyme to facilitate HMM alternan formation (28Moulis C.

HMM alternan is more soluble in water and less viscous than dextran, making it a good substitute for gum arabic (29Côté G.L.

Recently, the resolution of ASR 3D structure combined to mutagenesis and molecular docking unraveled the structural basis for α-1,3- and α-1,6-linkage specificity and for the alternance mechanism that is governed by the recognition of the terminal glucosidic linkage of the incoming acceptor, thanks to specific subsites (13Molina M. Moulis C. Monties N. Pizzut-Serin S. Guieysse D. Morel S. Cioci G. Remaud Siméon M. Deciphering an undecided enzyme: investigations of the structural determinants involved in the linkage specificity of alternansucrase.ACS Catal. 2019; 9: 2222-223710.1021/acscatal.8b04510Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Several residues in the proximity of the active site were also found to be critical for HMM alternan formation. In particular, the replacement of Trp675 (subsite +2) and Trp543 (subsite +3′) by alanine resulted in 82 and 54% decreases of HMM polymer synthesis, respectively. In addition, four putative sugar-binding pockets (V-A, V-B, V-C, and V-D) homologous to those found in other GH70 family enzymes have been identified in ASR domain V. Surprisingly, removal of the entire domain V did not completely abolish polymer formation but reduced it by 86% (13Molina M. Moulis C. Monties N. Pizzut-Serin S. Guieysse D. Morel S. Cioci G. Remaud Siméon M. Deciphering an undecided enzyme: investigations of the structural determinants involved in the linkage specificity of alternansucrase.ACS Catal. 2019; 9: 2222-223710.1021/acscatal.8b04510Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The control of polymer elongation by ASR is thus complex, involving residues of both the catalytic site and domain V. To get deeper insight in this mechanism, we placed our effort in the resolution of several ASR complexes. To this end, ASR crystals were soaked with different sugars varying in terms of degree of polymerization (DP) and glycosidic linkages. We obtained several complexes with different types of oligosaccharides bound in domains A and V. Combined with mutant characterization, the study highlighted the contribution of the domain V in HMM alternan formation and shed light on the importance of a new surface/secondary binding site found in domain A but remote from the catalytic core, which is defined by residues Tyr717 and Gln700 and was named SBS-A1. To explore the structural determinants for alternan elongation, ASRΔ2 crystals were soaked with different acceptors varying in size and structures (Fig. 1). The following ligands were tested: glucose, isomaltose (I2), nigerose (α-d-Glcp-(1→3)-d-Glc), isomaltotriose (I3), panose, isomaltononaose (I9), isomaltododecaose (I12, α-d-Glcp-(1→6)-[α-d-Glcp-(1→6)]10-d-Glc), and a partially purified oligoalternan (OA) with a DP of ∼8 that contains 39% of α-1,3-linkages and 61% of α-1,6-linkages (Figs. S1 and S2). For the complexes with I2, I3, panose, and OA, we unexpectedly observed a positive difference electron density in the domain A, in a site that we named surface-binding site A1 (SBS-A1) and that has never been described before in GH70 family enzymes (Fig. 1). For the same four ligands plus the I9, density was also observed in the domain V at a position corresponding to the sugar-binding pocket V-B (Gly234–Thr304) previously proposed to be a putative sugar-binding pocket (13Molina M. Moulis C. Monties N. Pizzut-Serin S. Guieysse D. Morel S. Cioci G. Remaud Siméon M. Deciphering an undecided enzyme: investigations of the structural determinants involved in the linkage specificity of alternansucrase.ACS Catal. 2019; 9: 2222-223710.1021/acscatal.8b04510Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In contrast, no interpretable electron density was found in the pocket referred as V-A, also previously predicted to be a sugar-binding pocket. In all the complexes, the ASR crystallized in the space group P212121 with the presence of two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit and a very similar unit cell as the previously solved unliganded structure. Resolutions obtained are between 3.0 and 3.5 Å. Of note, in all the obtained complexes we will refer to the chain A in which the electron density is better defined. The glucosyl units of each oligosaccharide will be numbered in ascending order from their reducing end. We used the I2 and I3 complexes for which we obtained the highest resolution (3.0 Å) to model the isomaltose and isomaltotriose that are bound in pocket V-B. Comparison with the high resolution structures of the branching sucrase GBD-CD2 from L. citreum NRRL B-1299 in complex with I2 and I3 helped the assignment of protein–ligand interactions (Fig. S3). The Glcp2 is in CH-π stacking interaction with Tyr241 (ASR numbering) and interacts with Gln278, Gln270, and Lys280 through O2, O3, and O1 atoms, respectively, and also with the main-chain oxygen of Thr297 through O3 (Fig. 2A and Fig. S4). The Glcp1 mainly interacts with the Thr249 through its O5 and with the Lys280 through O6 and O5 hydroxyls, which suggests that Lys280 is a pivotal residue for the recognition of isomaltose moiety, as already observed in branching sucrase GBD-CD2 and dextransucrase DSR-M structures. In the I3 complex, Glcp3 occupies the remaining part of the pocket, which is delimited by Asp266 and weakly interacts with Asp266 and Asn268. Although obtained at lower resolution (Fig. S4), the other complexes obtained in pocket V-B (panose, OA, and I9) have also been modeled on the basis of the already established I2–I3 interaction. Panose interacts mainly with its isomaltose moiety because the presence of the short α-1,4 linkage probably destabilizes the interaction between Lys280 and Glcp1. For the OA complex, only three monosaccharides could be modeled into the electron density, which has a different shape than the I3 molecule (Fig. S4). Assuming that an isomaltose moiety is still in interaction with Gln278/Gln280, this ligand has been modeled as one isomaltose moiety further decorated by an α-1,3-linked glucose on its nonreducing end (Fig. 2C). Unfortunately, the remaining part of the oligosaccharide is not visible, and the lower resolution of this complex does not allow a complete modeling of this interaction. Lastly, it should be observed that in all complexes two protein monomers are arranged around a pseudo 2-fold axis in the asymmetric unit, and the domain V of each unit is intertwined with its equivalent of the second chain. Only seven of nine glucosyl units of isomaltononaose are visible into electron density, and they appear to bind at the interface of the two pockets V-B of each chain (Fig. S5). In our structures Gln270, Tyr241, Gln278, and Lys280 of pocket V-B are well-aligned with Gln186, Tyr158, Gln194, and Lys196 of pocket V-A (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas different residues are found in the pocket V-C (Fig. 2D and Fig. S6). On this basis we can propose that the sugar-binding pockets V-A and V-B are functional, whereas the pocket V-C is likely to be nonfunctional because of the absence of the QXK motif that, associated with a Tyr residue at the bottom of the pocket, was suggested to be a signature of sugar-binding pocket functionality (Fig. 2D) (12Claverie M.

The structural comparison of pockets V-A and V-B revealed similarities but also subtle differences; in particular, the pocket V-A seems to be more open with a longer distance between the aromatic platform (Tyr158 OH) and the top of the pocket (Thr213 O) that might explain the reduced affinity for oligosaccharides, at least in the crystalline form (Fig. S6). To further investigate the role of V-A and V-B pockets, the central stacking residues, Tyr158 and Tyr241, respectively, were replaced by an alanine. The mutations resulted in a slight decrease of the HMM polymer yield, from 31.5% for the WT to 27.2, 28, and 27.6% for the Y158A mutant, the Y241A mutant, and the Y158A/Y241A double mutant, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table 1). Enzyme specific activity, specificity, and melting temperature were not significantly affected for these three mutants (Table 1).Table 1Biochemical data of the characterized mutants.

Large number of produced seeds and easy dispersion favor the colonization of agricultural fields by this species. To know the factors that affect the germination of B. subalternans can help to understand its ecology, permitting to develop control strategies. Laboratory experiments were carried out to evaluate how the temperature, photoperiod, burial depth, water deficit, and salt stress affect the seed germination of B. subalternans. The means of the treatments of each experiment were shown in scatter plots with the bars indicating the least significant difference (LSD, p≤0.05). The results showed a germination percentage above 77% for a wide alternating temperature (15/20 C to 30/35 C night/day). The highest germination and uniformity occurred at 25/30°C night/day. Only 11% of the seeds germinated at a temperature of 35/40°C night/day. The deeper burial of seeds reduced their germination. Only 17% of the seeds germinated in darkness conditions. However, in constant light and 12 hours of light/dark conditions the germination percentage was over 96%, confirming the light dependence of the B. subalternans during germination. In constant light and 12 hours of light/dark, the germination was over 96%. B. subalternans seeds showed sensitivity to water and salt stress, and their germination was inhibited under a water potential of -0.4 MPa and 100.09 mM, respectively. The sensitivity of B. subalternans seeds to high temperatures, water stress, and salt stress explains the high frequency of this weed in south-central Brazil. The light and sowing depth showed that burial of seeds by mechanical control is a strategy to reduce the high infestation of B. subalternans."

In human ovarian cells, grape seed extracts (GSE) improved steroid production. Here, we investigated the effects of a GSE dietary supplementation on egg production and quality, fertility parameters, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and steroid content in yolk egg associated to plasma adipokines in broiler hens. For this, we designed two in vivo experiments, the first one included three groups of hens: A (control), B and C (supplemented with GSE at 0.5% and 1% of the total diet composition, respectively, since week 4), and the second one used two groups of hens: A (control) and D (supplemented with GSE at 1% of the total diet composition since hatching). We assessed the egg production from 23th to 40th weeks and quality at 33th week. After artificial inseminations, the fertility parameters were calculated. In egg yolk, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) level and steroid production were evaluated by Ros-Glo H202 and ELISA assay, respectively. Expression of steroidogenic enzymes and adipokines and their receptors was determined by RT-qPCR in ovarian cells and plasma adipokines (RARRES2, ADIPOQ and NAMPT) were evaluated by specific ELISA assays. The fertility parameters and egg production were unaffected by GSE supplementation whatever the experiment (exp.). However, the rate of double-yolk eggs decreased for all GSE supplemented groups (exp. 1 P <0.01, exp.2, P<0.02). In exp.1, C group eggs were bigger and larger (P<0.0001) and the shell elasticity was higher for both B and C (P<0.0003) as compared to control. In the egg yolk, GSE supplementation in both exp. reduced ROS content and steroidogenesis consistent with a decrease in P450 aromatase and StAR mRNA expression and basal in vitro progesterone secretion in granulosa cells (P<0.001). Interestingly, in both exp. RARRES2 plasma levels were positively correlated while ADIPOQ and NAMPT plasma levels were negatively correlated, with steroids and ROS in yolk (P<0.0001). Taken together, maternal dietary GSE supplementation did not affect egg production and fertility parameters whereas it reduced ROS content and steroidogenesis in yolk egg. Furthermore, it ameliorated egg quality by decreasing the number of double-yolk eggs and by improving the size of normal eggs and the elasticity of the shell. Taken together, our data suggest the possibility of using dietary maternal GSE to improve egg quality."

In saltwater, its attachment to chitin surfaces not only serves as the initial step of nutrient recruitment but is also a crucial mechanism underlying cholera epidemics. In this study, we report the first characterization of a chitooligosaccharide-specific chitoporin, VcChiP, from the cell envelope of the V. cholerae type strain O1. We modeled the structure of VcChiP, revealing a trimeric cylinder that forms single channels in phospholipid bilayers. The membrane-reconstituted VcChiP channel was highly dynamic and voltage induced. Substate openings O1′, O2′, and O3′, between the fully open states O1, O2, and O3, were polarity selective, with nonohmic conductance profiles. Results of liposome-swelling assays suggested that VcChiP can transport monosaccharides, as well as chitooligosaccharides, but not other oligosaccharides.

The main symptoms of V. cholerae infection are watery diarrhea and vomiting, causing dehydration, and the condition is life-threatening if not treated promptly. V. cholerae is a facultative anaerobe that employs both respiratory and fermentative metabolism using different carbon sources. In aquatic environments, they can grow on the chitin surfaces of abundant zooplankton, using them as their sole carbon source (5Blokesch M.

It has been reported that the gene expression profiles of V. cholerae are different during the human and environmental stages of their life cycle, allowing them to live under fluctuating conditions, such as temperature shifts, osmotic stress, and nutrient limitation, in the aquatic environment, as well as to reside inside human hosts (4Aunkham A.

On the attachment of V. cholerae to chitin, the polysaccharide is broken down by extracellular chitinases into small chitooligomers, which are then transported through the cell wall of the bacteria through one of the protein channels (porins) for further metabolism as the source of energy (11Hunt D.E.

Several outer-membrane porins from V. cholerae have been identified and characterized (13Chakrabarti S.R. Chaudhuri K. Sen K. Das J.

Further microarray expression experiments identified an ORF in mRNAs of V. cholerae expressed in response to growth of the bacteria on chitin oligosaccharides, and VC0972 was identified as the chip gene encoding chitoporin (ChiP), which serves as a chitooligosaccharide transporter (12Meibom K.L.

The genes encoding ChiPs are conserved in marine Vibrio species, emphasizing the physiological importance of the outer membrane ChiP in chitin utilization as the primary transporting system for chitinous nutrients. At the molecular level, it is still unclear how ChiP mediates the specific uptake of chitooligosaccharides, although our recent report suggests that the N-plug located on the periplasmic side plays an important role in substrate translocation by the ortholog VhChiP (4Aunkham A.

VC0972), which encodes VcChiP, in the genome of V. cholerae. The chip fragment was cloned into the pET23d(+) expression plasmid, and the recombinant VcChiP was expressed in the outer membrane protein (omp)-deficient Escherichia coli BL21(Omp8) strain. Using electrophysiological and biochemical approaches, we characterized chitooligosaccharide permeation through VcChiP reconstituted into artificial phospholipid membranes. Cell growth experiments were also carried out to verify the important role of VcChiP in the growth of the bacteria on chitooligosaccharides. The chip gene fragment encoding the full-length VcChiP was successfully ligated into the pET23d(+) expression vector, so as to be expressed under the control of the T7 promoter. Physical and chemical parameters for VcChiP were predicted from the ProtParam tool at the ExPASy bioinformatics resource portal (RRID:SCR_018087). The theoretical mass of the mature VcChiP lacking its signal peptide was 35,584 Da, and the predicted pI was 4.7. Here, we analyzed the sequence similarity between the newly identified VcChiP from V. cholerae and the recently characterized VhChiP from V. harveyi (18Suginta W. Chumjan W. Mahendran K.R. Schulte A.

As shown in the sequence alignment in Fig. 1, the amino acid sequence of VcChiP (UniProtKB entry Q9KTD0) is 38% identical to that of VhChiP (UniProtKB entry L0RVU0). The predicted secondary structure of VcChiP comprises 16 β-strands (β1–β16) flanked by 8 extracellular loops (L1–L8). There are three short α-helices, one at the N terminus and the other two on loop L3. The short helix located at the N terminus, referred to as the N-plug in VhChiP, contains 9 amino acids, whereas only 3 amino acids are predicted in VcChiP (residues LSD, in green). Long loops, other than loops L2, L3, L4, and L7, are similar in length to those in VhChiP, whereas L1 and L8 of VhChiP (residues in green) appear to be longer than those in VcChiP. In contrast, loop L5 of VcChiP (residues in red) is longer than L5 of VhChiP. The modelled structure of VcChiP was analyzed further. Figure 2A shows a top view of the homotrimeric subunits of VcChiP. One of the three subunits is depicted by a surface representation, showing the overall electrostatic features of the internal and extracellular surfaces of the protein channel to be strongly negatively charged, based on the ABPS electrostatics scale (Fig. 2A). The other two subunits are cartoon representations, showing the β-barrel assemblies, like those of all known porins. The most prominent loop, known as L3, consists of two short helices protruding toward the central part of the channel lumen. This loop has been suggested to control the size of molecules that pass through the protein cylinder, and as such it has been referred to as the pore constriction loop (4Aunkham A. Zahn M.

Figure 2B is a superimposition of the modelled structure of VcChiP on the crystal structure of VhChiP, yielding an r.m.s.d. of 0.147 Å for 290 Cα atoms, a value that indicates high similarity in their overall structures. Loop L3, residing within the lumen (Fig. 2B, cyan for VhChiP and orange for VcChiP), is essentially identical in the two ChiPs. We previously showed that residue Trp136 in loop L3 of VhChiP played an important role in regulating sugar binding and permeation (19Chumjan W. Winterhalter M. Schulte A. Benz R. Suginta W.

The sequence alignment identified Trp118 in L3 of VcChiP in a location equivalent to that of Trp136 of VhChiP (Fig. 1, red, open box). Three loops that are noticeably dissimilar in the two ChiPs are L1, L5, and L8. Superimposition of the Cα traces clearly shows that loop L5 is highly mobile and extraordinarily long in VcChiP but short in VhChiP (Fig. 2B, red). On the other hand, loops L1 and L8 are much longer in VhChiP than the corresponding loops in VcChiP (Fig. 2B, cyan). A short helix is located at the N terminus of both proteins but is much shorter (3 amino acids) in VcChiP than in VhChiP (9 amino acids). The chip gene was cloned into the pET23d(+) expression vector, ready to be expressed in the omp-deficient E. coli BL21(DE3) Omp8 Rosetta cell. The recombinant VcChiP, with its own 23-amino-acid signal sequence, was successfully expressed and inserted into the cell wall of the E. coli host. VcChiP was extracted from the cell walls with 2% (w/v) SDS, followed by 3.5% (v/v) octyl–n-octylpolyoxyethylene. The purity of the protein obtained after detergent extraction was 80–90%, and it was further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q HP column, followed by gel filtration on a HiPrep® 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 column. The purity after two chromatographic steps was 95–99%, with a final yield of 5–10 mg protein per liter of bacterial culture. The purified VcChiP was subjected to trypsin digestion, and the resultant tryptic peptides were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS before functional characterization was carried out. Nine tryptic peptides with monoisotopic masses compatible with the calculated masses were clearly identified (Table 1) in the putative sequence of VcChiP, providing 41% sequence coverage. The result confirmed that the recombinant protein expressed in the E. coli BL21(DE3) Omp8 host was VcChiP.Table 1Mass identification of tryptic peptides of recombinant chitoporin (VcChiP) from V. cholerae strain O1 by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometryPeptide no.

With protein addition on either the cis or the trans side of the phospholipid membrane, reconstituted VcChiP induced a sudden jump of ion current from zero to higher levels under applied potentials, indicating that the recombinant VcChiP could form channels, allowing ion flow and detectable ionic currents. However, the VcChiP channel exhibited significantly different behavior from that of the previously studied VhChiP (22Suginta W. Chumjan W. Mahendran K.R. Janning P. Schulte A. Winterhalter M. Molecular uptake of chitooligosaccharides through chitoporin from the marine bacterium Vibrio harveyi.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8 (23383078): e5512610.1371/journal.pone.0055126Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), despite the overall resemblance in their structures, in the following respects. (1) The ionic current passing through the VcChiP channel was rapidly fluctuating, with spontaneous gating throughout the recording time (Fig. 3). (2) The VcChiP channel clearly exhibited voltage dependence, being rarely open at low positive potentials (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively) but more regularly open and fluctuating at the equivalent negative potentials (Fig. 3, E and F). Frequent channel openings were induced by applying high, physiologically irrelevant potentials, i.e. > ±150 mV (Fig. 3, C and D and G and H) (3Huq A. Sack R.B. Nizam A. Longini I.M. Nair G.B. Ali A.

The ionic currents were significantly greater at negative potentials than at the corresponding positive potentials, yielding higher conductance values of the protein subunits at negative than at positive potentials. (4) With protein addition on the cis side, positive potentials additionally induced protein gating, with the opening of substate O1′ (Fig. 3, A and B) and substates O′1 and O′2 (Fig. 3, C and D, histogram analysis) between the fully open states O1 and O2, respectively. The open states O2 and O3 were rarely observed. (5) Much less gating was observed with negative potentials. Opening of mono-, di-, and trimeric subunits to the fully open states O1, O2, and O3 was observed (Fig. 3, E–H, histogram analysis). The trimeric openings were seen more regularly at applied potentials above −150 mV (Fig. 3, G and H, respectively). The opposite results were obtained with protein addition on the trans side. Figure 4 shows representative ion traces for continuous recording times of 1 min at different applied potentials. Figure 4, A–D, shows that ion currents were more stably open, with fully open states O1, O2, and O3 having discrete increases in potential from +50 to +100, +150, and +199 mV, respectively. In marked contrast, ion currents at negative potentials were highly fluctuating, with additional substates O1′, O2′, and O3′ between the main open states O1, O2, and O3 (Fig. 4, E–H). Larger ion currents were seen with positive potentials in the case of trans addition. At +199 mV, three subunits were almost constantly open (Fig. 4D), whereas −199 mV generated flickering currents (Fig. 4H). The ion current-voltage (I-V) relationship was further analyzed. Figure 5 shows plots of ion currents versus applied potential over the range of −199 to +199 mV, with protein addition on the cis (Fig. 5A) and trans (Fig. 5B) sides. The asymmetrical behavior of the channel response to positive and negative values of the applied potential is clear. The I-V plots show that with cis-side addition (Fig. 5A), the channels were more fully open at negative potentials with the main opening states O1, O2, and O3. Positive potentials generated highly gated openings with minor substates O′1 and O′2. The results were reversed with trans-side addition (Fig. 5B). Single-channel recordings were carried out multiple times to obtain a reliable population of VcChiP insertions (n = 33). It was consistently found that the channel had greater conductance at negative potentials than at positive potentials with addition on the cis side (Fig. 5C). Among all these measurements, we observed only one insertion showing the opposite behavior, with larger conductance at positive potentials and channel gating with lower subconductance values at negative potentials. These results indicate the asymmetric insertion of VcChiP into lipid membranes. Again, with protein added to the trans chamber, the conductance values were larger with positive potentials than with negative ones (Fig. 5D), and the conductance values increased in a nonproportional fashion as the applied potential was increased in either direction. The effects of voltage on conductance values were most pronounced with negative potentials for cis-side addition and with positive potentials for trans-side addition. Table 2 summarizes the representative conductance values of subunit openings at ±175 mV for both cis- and trans-side addition. Considering the cis/−175 mV condition, the conductance values for mono-, di-, and trimeric subunits (fully open states O1, O2, and O3) are 0.6 ± 0.1, 1.3 ± 0.2, and 1.9 ± 0.2 nS. For the cis/+175 mV condition, full trimeric opening scarcely occurred, so it was impossible to determine the conductance value for the state O3. The conductance values for full conductance of states O1 (0.4 ± 0.01 nS) and O2 (0.8 ± 0.04 nS) are approximately two-thirds of the corresponding values under negative potential. Subconductance values for states O1′ and O2′ additionally are estimated at 0.2 ± 0.02 and 0.6 ± 0.01 nS, respectively. Regarding the trans/+175 mV condition, the conductance values for the fully open states O1, O2, and O3 are roughly the same as those under the cis/+175 mV condition. Notably, the conductance values for dimeric (1.0 ± 0.01 nS) and trimeric (1.4 ± 0.06 nS) subunits from the trans/−175 mV condition are significantly less than the values from the trans/+175 mV condition. The subconductance values for the substates O1′, O2′, and O3′ are 0.4 ± 0.01, 0.7 ± 0.02, and 1.1 ± 0.01 nS, respectively. The values for O1′ and O2′ are slightly larger than the corresponding values under the cis/+175 mV condition.Table 2Single-channel conductance of VcChiP subunitsaThe electrolyte was 1 m KCl–20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5.

The presence of LPS results in autocatalytic activation of proC to α-chelicerase C, which, in turn, activates proB to chelicerase B, converting proCE to the clotting enzyme (CE). ProB and proCE contain an N-terminal clip domain, but the roles of these domains in this coagulation cascade remain unknown. Here, using recombinant proteins and kinetics and binding assays, we found that five basic residues in the clip domain of proB are required to maintain its LPS-binding activity and activation by α-chelicerase C. Moreover, an amino acid substitution at a potential hydrophobic cavity in proB's clip domain (V55A-proB) reduced both its LPS-binding activity and activation rate. WT proCE exhibited no LPS-binding activity, and the WT chelicerase B-mediated activation of a proCE variant with a substitution at a potential hydrophobic cavity (V53A-proCE) was ∼4-fold slower than that of WT proCE. The kcat/Km value of the interaction of WT chelicerase B with V53A-proCE was 7-fold lower than that of the WT chelicerase B-WT proCE interaction. The enzymatic activities of V55A-chelicerase B and V53A-CE against specific peptide substrates were indistinguishable from those of the corresponding WT proteases. In conclusion, the clip domain of proB recruits it to a reaction center composed of α-chelicerase C and LPS, where α-chelicerase C is ready to activate proB, leading to chelicerase B–mediated activation of proCE via its clip domain.

The LPS-triggered horseshoe crab coagulation cascade consists of prochelicerase C (proC), prochelicerase B (proB), and the proclotting enzyme (proCE), all of which belong to the trypsin family. A classical model for the proteolytic activation of serine protease zymogens has been established for trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen; both zymogens are activated by proteolytic cleavage of the Arg15–Ile16 bond in chymotrypsinogen numbering, followed by an insertion of the newly appearing N-terminal Ile16 into the activation pocket, the Ile16 cleft, to form a salt bridge between the α-amino group of Ile16 and the side chain of Asp194, which triggers conformational changes of the substrate binding site and the oxyanion hole required for catalysis (6Bode W.

The clip-domain-containing proteases are proteolytically activated by their specific upstream proteases, and the clip and catalytic domains of the resulting active forms remain to be covalently linked by a disulfide bond (14Muta T.

Interestingly, proB binds to LPS, and a mutant proB without the clip domain (Δclip-proB) exhibits decreased LPS-binding activity and a lower rate of activation by α-chelicerase C than WT proB (11Kobayashi Y.

In this study, to examine the roles of the clip domains of proB and proCE, we prepared several variants of proB and proCE with mutations in the clip domains and compared the LPS-binding activity and the activation rate of each of the mutants with those of the WT zymogens. A reagent prepared from hemocyte lysates of horseshoe crabs has been used for the Limulus test, a sensitivity test to detect LPS (23Armstrong P.B.

Here we prepared a WT proCE to apply a functional recombinant zymogen to a next-generation Limulus test. WT proB, prepared in an HEK293S cell line lacking N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GnTI−), contains two types of zymogen: the single-chain form and the two-chain form, consisting of the H and L chains formed through cleavage at site 1 by an unknown protease (Fig. 1). The activation rate of both types of proB by α-chelicerase C is assessed by detecting the appearance of the B chain through cleavage at site 2 by Western blotting using an anti-B chain antibody (11Kobayashi Y.

To confirm whether the cleavage reaction at site 2 for the proteolytic activation was quantified by Western blotting, WT proB at various concentrations was incubated with α-chelicerase C in the presence of LPS at an [E]/[S] ratio of 1/200 for 30 min at 37 °C and subjected to Western blotting. Site 2 of WT proB was cleaved, and the resulting B chain was detected (Fig. 2A). The relative band density was in direct proportion to the concentration of WT proB at least in the density range between 25 and 100 nm (Fig. 2B). After 30 min of incubation, WT proB at every concentration was cleaved ∼35% under the conditions used (Fig. 2C). Studies on LPS-binding proteins such as proC (14Muta T. Hashimoto R. Miyata T.

The clip domain of proB contains five basic residues (Arg17, Lys21, Lys25, Lys38, and Arg50). To determine whether the basic residues in the clip domain of proB are involved in the interaction with LPS, substitution mutants were prepared by replacing each of these basic residues with a glutamic acid, R17E-proB, K21E-proB, K25E-proB, K38E-proB, and R50E-proB. Each of these substitution mutants was incubated with WT α-chelicerase C in the presence of LPS and subjected to Western blotting (Fig. 3A). All of the mutants, especially K21E-proB, K25E-proB, and K38E-proB, exhibited slower activation by α-chelicerase C at the initial reaction phase, around 2 min of incubation, than WT proB (Fig. 3, A and B). To confirm the reduction of the activation rates of K21E-proB, K25E-proB, and K38E-proB by Western blotting, the expression time course of the amidase activity was monitored using a fluorogenic peptide substrate for chelicerase B, butoxycarbonyl-Leu-Thr-Arg-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Boc-L-T-R-MCA). The amidase activities of the three mutants were expressed more slowly than that that of WT proB (Fig. 3C). These findings indicate that the basic residues in the clip domain of proB play important roles to maintain the activation rate by α-chelicerase C. To determine the LPS-binding activity of these mutants of proB, the LPS-binding parameters were determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. As a positive control, WT proB exhibited an LPS-binding activity with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.2 × 10−9 M (kass = 6.0 × 105 M−1s−1 and kdiss = 7.6 × 10−3 s−1), comparable to the reported Kd value of 3.5 × 10−9 M (11Kobayashi Y. Takahashi T. Shibata T. Ikeda S. Koshiba T. Mizumura H. Oda T. Kawabata S. Factor B is the second lipopolysaccharide-binding protease zymogen in the horseshoe crab coagulation cascade.J. Biol.

However, the binding parameters of the five point mutants of proB could not be determined by SPR analysis because of their lower affinity for the LPS used to coat the sensor tip. These findings indicate that the basic residues in the clip domain of proB play an important role in maintaining the LPS-binding activity. K21E-proB, K25E-proB, and K38E-proB were fully converted into the active forms, which required a 6-h incubation at 37 °C with WT α-chelicerase C in the presence of LPS, and the kinetic parameters were determined using the specific fluorogenic substrate Boc-L-T-R-MCA. A preliminary experiment using WT chelicerase B showed a very high Km value (∼200 μm). Therefore, only kcat/Km values were determined under the conditions where [S] was below the Km value at an enzyme concentration of 10 nm, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The kcat/Km values of these activated mutants were equivalent to that of WT chelicerase B (Table 1), indicating that the substitutions of Lys21, Lys25, and Lys38 with E did not affect the amidase activities against the peptide substrate.Table 1Kinetic parameters of WT proteases and their mutants in the horseshoe crab coagulation cascade against the peptide substratesaData are means ± S.E. from three independent experiments.

These analyses revealed a unique hydrophobic cavity in the clip domains, comprising several conserved hydrophobic amino acids (dots in Fig. 4A). The hydrophobic cavity of Hd-PPAF-II is very important for recognizing prophenoloxidase, because an Hd-PPAF-II mutant with the substitution V111A causes a deficiency of the cofactor activity needed for the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase (29Piao S. Song Y. Kim J.H. Park S.Y. Park J.W. Lee B.L. Oh B. Ha N.

Therefore, we prepared a substitution mutant in the clip domain of proB (V55A-proB), which corresponds to residue Val111 of Hd-PPAF-II (Fig. 4A). Based on the sequence similarity, the locations of Val55 and the five basic residues in the clip domain of proB were superimposed in the crystal structure of the clip domain of Hd-PPAF-II (Fig. 4B). The activation of V55A-proB by WT α-chelicerase C in the presence of LPS was monitored by both Western blotting and the expression time course of the amidase activity. Western blotting indicated that the relative band intensity of the B chain for V55A-proB at 5 min of incubation was 4-fold lower than that for WT proB (Fig. 5, A and B). The expression of the amidase activity for V55A-proB at 5 min of incubation was 6-fold lower than that for WT proB (Fig. 5C). V55A-proB was fully converted to V55A-chelicerase B by 6 h of incubation with WT α-chelicerase C in the presence of LPS. The kcat/Km value of V55A-chelicerase B against Boc-L-T-R-MCA was equivalent to that of WT chelicerase B, suggesting that the potential hydrophobic cavity of proB does not affect the amidase activity (Table 1). Interestingly, V55A-proB exhibited no binding activity for the LPS-coated tip of the SPR sensor, indicating that the potential hydrophobic cavity plays a role in maintaining the LPS-binding activity of proB.

The prepared WT proCE had a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 48 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A). WT proCE had no significant affinity for the LPS-coated tip of the SPR sensor, indicating that the clip domain of proCE has no LPS-binding activity.

All individuals with suspected Sleep Apnea referred (January 2010-September 2017) for a one-night polysomnography were included. Demographics, self-reported symptoms and comorbidities were documented. The relationship between OSA severity and the presence of symptoms and comorbidities were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. Overall, 663 subjects were assessed. Of these, 57.3% were referred from chest physicians, and sleep test results were abnormal in 589 subjects (88.8%) of whom 526 patients (89.3%) fulfilled diagnostic criteria for OSA; 76.3% were men and women were on average older. OSA was severe in 43.2% and more severe in men. Almost all patients were symptomatic with ~2–4 symptoms per patient and women presented with symptoms that are more atypical. Comorbidities were significantly higher in women. In the multivariate analysis, age, male sex, obesity, symptoms of snoring, excessive daytime somnolence and witnessed apneas were associated with OSA severity. Only age and obesity were associated with self-reported diagnosis of hypertension and diabetes. This is the first study in Lebanon to explore the characteristics of patients with polysomnography-diagnosed OSA. High prevalence of severe OSA and low referral rates in the medical community support promoting awareness for an earlier diagnosis and more personalized approach in this country."

Identifying terminators correctly can optimize the genome annotation, more importantly, it has considerable application value in disease diagnosis and therapies. However, accurate prediction methods are deficient and in urgent need. Therefore, we proposed a prediction method ""iterb-PPse"" for terminators by incorporating 47 nucleotide properties into PseKNC-Ⅰ and PseKNC-Ⅱ and utilizing Extreme Gradient Boosting to predict terminators based on Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Combing with the preceding methods, we employed three new feature extraction methods K-pwm, Base-content, Nucleotidepro to formulate raw samples. The two-step method was applied to select features. When identifying terminators based on optimized features, we compared five single models as well as 16 ensemble models. As a result, the accuracy of our method on benchmark dataset achieved 99.88%, higher than the existing state-of-the-art predictor iTerm-PseKNC in 100 times five-fold cross-validation test. Its prediction accuracy for two independent datasets reached 94.24% and 99.45% respectively. For the convenience of users, we developed a software on the basis of ""iterb-PPse"" with the same name. The open software and source code of ""iterb-PPse"" are available at https://github.com/Sarahyouzi/iterb-PPse."
https://openalex.org/W3024430848,"Under physiologic conditions, the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits exceptionally low levels of activity compared to other brain regions. A sparse activation pattern is observed even when the DG is engaged to process new information; for example, only ~1-3% of neurons in the DG granule cell layer (GCL) are activated after placing animals in a novel, enriched environment. Moreover, such physiologic stimulation of GCL neurons recruits young granule cells more readily than older cells. This sparse pattern of cell activation has largely been attributed to intrinsic circuit properties of the DG, such as reduced threshold for activation in younger cells, and increased inhibition onto older cells. Given these intrinsic properties, we asked whether such activation of young granule cells was unique to physiologic stimulation, or could be elicited by general pharmacological activation of the hippocampus. We found that administration of kainic acid (KA) at a low dose (5 mg/kg) to wildtype C57BL/6 mice activated a similarly sparse number of cells in the GCL as physiologic DG stimulation by exposure to a novel, enriched environment. However, unlike physiologic stimulation, 5 mg/kg KA activated primarily old granule cells as well as GABAergic interneurons. This finding indicates that intrinsic circuit properties of the DG alone may not be sufficient to support the engagement of young granule cells, and suggest that other factors such as the specificity of the pattern of inputs, may be involved."
https://openalex.org/W3025110483,"Freeman Dyson, a towering figure in physics and mathematics, died on 28 February at the age of 96. During his long and vibrant life, Dyson explored both concrete and visionary technologies, ranging from safe, small nuclear reactors to proposals to genetically modify trees so they could grow on comets. He documented his adventures in beautifully written books and a marvelous collection of Web of Science video interviews. Dyson's most impactful contribution to physics was his fundamental work on quantum electrodynamics (QED), the theory of how matter interacts with the electromagnetic field. His synthesis of ideas completed the physical foundation for chemistry, materials science, laser physics, and electrical engineering.

Dyson was born on 15 December 1923 and raised in the village of Crowthorne in the United Kingdom. As a young child, he loved to calculate and build, and he retained that joyful curiosity and creativity throughout his adulthood. In 1945, after lending his skills to the Royal Air Force as a civilian during World War II, he earned his bachelor's degree in mathematics from Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. He began graduate studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, in 1947, where he worked with physicists Hans Bethe and Richard Feynman. Although he had not completed his doctorate, Cornell offered him a position as professor in 1951. The following year, he was given an appointment at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton, New Jersey, where he remained until his retirement in 1994.

Quantum electrodynamics was a vibrant yet extremely murky subject when Dyson began studying it in 1948. Candidate equations had been proposed by Paul Dirac in the early 1930s, but attempts to solve the full equations had led to severe mathematical difficulties. Physicists retreated to a truncated version of the theory, which supported many successful applications. In the years after World War II, however, advances in electronics and microwave engineering enabled more delicate measurements, which went beyond the scope of the abbreviated theory. The challenge of working with the full theory rose to the top of the agenda of theoretical physics. Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga showed how to get more accurate equations in a systematic but laborious way, using algebra. Richard Feynman's radically different approach was based on intuition and diagrams. Each approach had advantages and drawbacks, and it was far from obvious whether the differing methods would always yield the same answers.

Dyson unified these varied approaches into a single theory. He showed how to derive Feynman's rules from Dirac's theory mathematically, without guesswork. Thanks to Dyson's work, QED became a theory of unparalleled precision. In several current applications, the successful comparison of intricate theory and refined experiment reaches the level of a few parts per billion. QED is, in Feynman's words, “the jewel of physics.”



The theoretical tools that Dyson fashioned to solve QED have been extremely versatile. In condensed matter physics, they catalyzed Philip Warren Anderson's work on localization and Kenneth Geddes Wilson's work on phase transitions. More directly, they empowered physicists to derive consequences of quantum field theories proposed to describe other fundamental interactions. Today, our best understanding of strong and weak interactions uses theories that are structurally similar to QED but more complex. Without Dyson's work, these theories would have been unthinkable.

In collaboration with mathematician Andrew Lenard, Dyson proved that quantum mechanics explains the stability of matter. This is by no means obvious, because electrical attractions might foster a collapse. Indeed, Dyson and Lenard showed that stability depends on the Pauli exclusion principle for electrons, a property that has no classical analog. Another notable contribution was a series of papers on the statistical properties of energy levels in complex quantum systems. Dyson discovered a splendor of emergent mathematical regularities that transcend differences among such systems.

Dyson's last major work was a collaboration with William Press on the iterated prisoner's dilemma. Press had discovered, through numerical work, strategies that allow one player in that classic game theory problem to dictate the results of the other player when the game is played repeatedly. He showed his puzzling conclusions to Dyson, who—despite being almost 90 years old and a complete outsider to the field—Press thought might help. The next morning, Dyson presented him with the mathematical analysis that cracked the problem. Together, Dyson and Press injected a revolutionary, mathematically brilliant new idea into the problem—a kind of “enforceable deterrence”—that had escaped researchers in the field for decades. In this last work, Dyson beautifully illustrated the enduring power of mathematics to surprise, entertain, and enlighten. It was a fitting conclusion to a creative career that had begun 65 years earlier with important papers in number theory.

Dyson was a brilliant conversationalist. Part of this talent came from his penetrating empathy: He would focus an intense gaze on his interlocutor and process every word. Another part came from his quick intelligence: His answers came in complete paragraphs and were usually right on point. In 1998, when I was writing a review of quantum field theory, I asked many prominent physicists to pinpoint the most important insight about the physical world from that subject. Dyson immediately replied with the answer I had been proud to reach only after considerable thought (namely, that all electrons are exactly the same).

Dyson was wonderfully generous to his friends and colleagues. When my wife, Betsy Devine, organized a monthly newsletter for visitors to the IAS, Dyson contributed a monthly astronomy column. He also had a special appreciation of children. When my daughters spent time in my IAS office, which was directly below his, he never failed to stop by. His eyes sparkled and his expression glowed as he talked with them. He once told me that they were my best work. I was pleased to discover, years later, that when an interviewer asked Dyson what he considered his own best work, he said “raising six kids, who have become productive citizens.”"

I enjoy mentoring and have worked with a number of student groups over the years, but this offer was different. The group—called Brother 2 Brother (B2B)—is largely composed of African American and Latino students. It has a good reputation for fostering a supportive environment for male students who find themselves in the minority in virtually every other situation they encounter across campus. But I was reluctant to get involved because I didn't see myself as the right person for the job. What would a 52-year-old white male professor raised in largely white northern Appalachia have to offer?

It wasn't the first time the administrator, who founded B2B, asked me to get involved. Previously, I had always declined, thinking that the job would be better left to someone whose background was more similar to that of the group members. Plus, I wasn't sure I could fit it in my schedule. This time, though, with the administrator heading off to a different university and the current faculty adviser in poor health, I felt I couldn't say no.

I knew from the beginning that I needed to earn the right to be listened to—that my age, rank, and background would discourage openness. I spent roughly 1 year paying dues—simply being present, listening, and trying to be helpful—before the students began to see me as worthy of trust.

The first few meetings were especially awkward. I was clearly the outsider—that out-of-place white dude sitting in the corner. The students shot me looks indicating they were wondering why I was there. During the first year, I only managed to develop a few connections. It was a little disheartening, but I stuck with it because I had made a commitment and no one stepped up to take my place.

I'm glad I continued to work with the group, because in year two the students started to open up to me with questions and problems. There was little overlap between my rural upbringing and my students' largely urban backgrounds, but we bonded by discussing shared elements of our college experience: crummy jobs, financial aid issues, classroom experiences, music, sports, and the horrors of cafeteria food.

I did my best to help when they came to me with problems, even when I couldn't solve them myself. For example, one undergraduate student explained that he was having difficulty getting assistance from his academic adviser. I knew the faculty member, and I also knew he wasn't considered to be the best mentor. So I connected the student with another adviser, someone who always has time for students and is willing to problem-solve. I've also given group members tips about how to study and where to go on campus to troubleshoot administrative and academic issues. I didn't do anything most faculty couldn't do; the difference was that I was in the room to listen and provide advice.

My interactions with the B2B students have, honestly, been a highlight of my career—not only because I feel like I'm doing something worthwhile, but also because of what I've learned. The students have taught me to see the world through a different lens. They have given me a better understanding of the experiences of people of color—which, I believe, has strengthened my cultural competence and my ability to interact with others on a more meaningful level. And in the process, I've made new friends.

I encourage my fellow faculty members to get involved in programs such as B2B, even if you're not a member of an underrepresented group. It requires patience and time; it can be challenging, but it's also rewarding and fun. What's more, you'll help ease the service burden carried by our minority colleagues, work that is often invisible to white faculty and staff."
