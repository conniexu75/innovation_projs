https://openalex.org/W2152506161,"Local accumulation of the plant growth regulator auxin mediates pattern formation in Arabidopsis roots and influences outgrowth and development of lateral root- and shoot-derived primordia. However, it has remained unclear how auxin can simultaneously regulate patterning and organ outgrowth and how its distribution is stabilized in a primordium-specific manner. Here we show that five PIN genes collectively control auxin distribution to regulate cell division and cell expansion in the primary root. Furthermore, the joint action of these genes has an important role in pattern formation by focusing the auxin maximum and restricting the expression domain of PLETHORA (PLT) genes, major determinants for root stem cell specification. In turn, PLT genes are required for PIN gene transcription to stabilize the auxin maximum at the distal root tip. Our data reveal an interaction network of auxin transport facilitators and root fate determinants that control patterning and growth of the root primordium."

The mTOR pathway is regulated by a wide variety of cellular signals, including mitogenic growth factors, nutrients, cellular energy levels, and stress conditions. Recent studies have proposed several mechanisms to explain how mTOR is regulated by growth factors and cellular energy levels. However, little is known as to how mTOR is regulated by stress conditions. We observed that two stress-induced proteins, RTP801/Redd1 and RTP801L/Redd2, potently inhibit signaling through mTOR. Our data support that RTP801 and RTP801L work downstream of AKT and upstream of TSC2 to inhibit mTOR functions. These results add a new dimension to mTOR pathway regulation and provide a possible molecular mechanism of how cellular stress conditions may regulate mTOR function.

A fundamental question in cell biology is how various extracellular cues can cause changes in translational output and hence the growth of the cell. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 1The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; S6K, S6 kinase; 4EBP1, eukaryote initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, short interfering RNA. is a key regulator of translation that acts to stimulate protein synthesis by phosphorylating the ribosomal translation regulators p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryote initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (reviewed in Refs. 1Jacinto E.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1926-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar). mTOR is known to receive inputs from multiple signaling pathways and responds by increasing or decreasing protein synthesis appropriately. A prominent example of this phenomenon is how mTOR is stimulated by growth factors and the availability of nutrients, while it is inhibited by conditions such as low ATP levels, the absence of nutrients, or cellular stressors such as DNA damage or hypoxia. Regulation of protein synthesis by mTOR is responsible for controlling cell size and proliferation, and it has recently been shown that mTOR may also regulate other cellular processes such as cytoskeletal organization, mRNA turnover, transcription, and autophagy (1Jacinto E. Hall M.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Dysregulation of the mTOR pathway in vivo is associated with several inherited human syndromes, including tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), the PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, and Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (5Manning B.D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 399-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 6Inoki K. Corradetti M.N. Guan K.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 37: 19-34Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The tuberous sclerosis complex gene products, TSC1 and TSC2, are negative regulators of the mTOR signaling network (7Pan D. Dong J. Zhang Y. Gao X. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 78-85Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). TSC1 and TSC2 form a complex in the cell, and the integrity of the TSC1/2 complex is essential for either protein to function. Cells or tissues lacking TSC1 or TSC2 display high levels of mTOR activation as measured by the activation status of S6K and 4EBP1, indicating that the TSC1/2 complex negatively regulates mTOR function (8Tee A.R.

This inhibition occurs via the GAP (GTPase-activating protein) domain of TSC2. The target of the GAP activity of TSC2 is the small G protein Rheb, a potent positive upstream regulator of mTOR (12Zhang Y. Gao X. Saucedo L.J. Ru B. Edgar B.A. Pan D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 578-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 13Stocker H. Radimerski T. Schindelholz B. Wittwer F. Belawat P. Daram P. Breuer S. Thomas G. Hafen E. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Several studies have found that TSC2 stimulates GTP hydrolysis and inactivation of Rheb both in vivo and in vitro (15Li Y. Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Guan K.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 32-38Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 16Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 573-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Many of the signals known to impinge upon mTOR act through TSC2. For example, we have recently found that the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) directly phosphorylates and activates TSC2, thereby inhibiting translation through mTOR (17Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). AMPK is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated in response to low energy conditions. Under such conditions of ATP depletion, AMPK phosphorylates numerous substrates to enhance catabolism and suppress anabolism (18Hardie D.G. Hawley S.A. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). AMPK-mediated activation of TSC2 suppresses mTOR, as assayed by the inhibition of the phosphorylation of the mTOR targets S6K and 4EBP1, reduction in cellular protein synthesis, and a decrease in the overall size of cells (17Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). Therefore, the TSC2-mTOR pathway plays a critical role in the coordination between cellular energy levels and cell growth. In addition to low energy levels, it has been proposed that activation of AMPK is also responsible for coupling other stressors, such as osmotic stress, heat shock, or hypoxia to signaling through mTOR (19Hardie D.G. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5479-5487Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). AKT is a pro-survival kinase that is activated by insulin stimulation and positively regulates mTOR signaling by phosphorylating and inactivating TSC2 (9Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 20Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). AKT may also stimulate mTOR independently of TSC2 phosphorylation (22Dong J. Pan D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2479-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Recently, Reiling and Hafen (23Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2879-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) performed a genetic screen in Drosophila for genes that, when overexpressed, suppressed an mTOR hyperactivation phenotype downstream of AKT. Two hypoxia-induced proteins, termed Scylla and Charybdis, were identified from the genetic screen as negative regulators of the Drosophila TOR pathway. In this paper we investigate the mammalian orthologs of Scylla and Charybdis, RTP801 (also known as Redd1 and dig2) and RTP801L (also known as Redd2). RTP801 and RTP801L share ∼50% sequence identity to each other but show little homology to other known proteins. We show that both RTP801 and RTP801L function as potent negative regulators of the mammalian target of rapamycin. Furthermore, we show that these proteins function upstream of TSC2 and Rheb. Since RTP801 and RTP801L are up-regulated at the transcriptional level in response to a variety of stresses, including DNA damage, hypoxia, and glucocorticoid treatment (23Reiling J.H. Hafen E.

Anti-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG secondary antibodies were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). All other antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling. HA-tagged S6K (αII), FLAG-tagged 4EBP1, and GST-Akt were described previously (9Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Myc-tagged Rheb and Rheb-L64 were also described previously (29Inoki K. Li Y. Xu T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1829-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). RTP801 and RTP801L constructs were generated by PCR subcloning from IMAGE consortium clones 4302878 and 3877854 into the pCDNA3–3xHA and pPGS-cite-neo-HA vectors, between BamHI and EcoRI cloning sites. All newly made constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The AMPK inhibitor, commonly known as compound C, was obtained from Merck and was described previously (30Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4432) Google Scholar). Intact cells were treated with a 40 μm concentration of the compound suspended in Me2SO for 3 h preceding lysis. Rapamycin was purchased from Cell Signaling and was suspended in methanol. Negative controls for all experiments with pharmacological reagents included vehicle. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—Mammalian cell types were cultured and transfected as described previously (30Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M.

TSC2+/+ and TSC2–/– MEFs were obtained from D. Kwiatkowski. Cells were cultured for ∼48 h post-transfection unless otherwise noted, harvested in a mild lysis buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western analysis as described previously (31Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Bardeesy N. DePinho R.A. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). All immunoblots represent the best example of at least two repeated experimental trials. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (31Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Bardeesy N. DePinho R.A. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Retroviral Infection—Retroviral infection was performed by transfecting 293 Phoenix retrovirus packaging cells with empty vector or pPGS-CITE-neo-HA-RTP801 and RTP801L as described previously (17Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). RNA Interference (RNAi)—RTP801, RTP801L, and TSC2 short interfering RNAi oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon (Denver, CO). Each siRNA is a pool of four siRNAs directed against RTP801 or RTP801L. Oligonucleotides were transfected into HEK293 cells, and lysates were made ∼48 h post-transfection. Double-stranded RNAi against Scylla and Charybdis was made and used to treat S2 cells according to the method of Worby et al. (32Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Dixon J.E. Science's STKE. 2001; 2001: PL1PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether RTP801 and RTP801L function to suppress signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin, we determined the effect of overexpressed RTP801 and RTP801L on the key mTOR targets S6K and 4EBP1 in HEK293 cells. Our data show that both overexpressed RTP801 and RTP801L cause a dose-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of co-transfected S6K (Fig. 1A). The data also imply that RTP801L may be a more potent inhibitor of S6K than RTP801, since lower expression levels of RTP801L are required to inhibit S6K than RTP801 (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The RTP801- and RTP801L-mediated inhibition of co-expressed S6K was also observed in CHO cells (data not shown), indicating the effect is not specific to HEK293 cells. Similarly, RTP801 and RTP801L also inhibit the phosphorylation of co-expressed 4EBP1 (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that overproduction of RTP801 and RTP801L potently inhibit signaling through mTOR. Further supporting the physiological relevance of RTP801 and RTP801L in the regulation of S6K, we examined the effect of down-regulating RTP801 and RTP801L in HEK293 cells. Treatment of HEK293 cells with short interfering RNA oligouncleotides against RTP801 and RTP801L led to an increase in S6K phosphorylation on T389, and rapamycin treatment completely inhibited the effect of RTP801 or RTP801L RNAi (Fig. 2A). This increase was detected on both endogenous S6K (Fig. 2B) and on co-expressed S6K (Fig. 2A). We also observed an expected increase in phosphorylation of S6, the downstream target of S6K (Fig. 2B). Similar RNA interference experiments with Scylla and Charybdis were performed in Drosophila S2 cells. Down-regulation of either Scylla or Charybdis enhanced phosphorylation of the Drosophila S6K. 2M. N. Corradetti, K. Inoki, and K.-L. Guan, unpublished observations. Taken together with the overexpression experiments, these results further support the role of RTP801 and RTP801L as potent negative regulators of signaling upstream of mTOR. To address how RTP801 and RTP801L inhibit signaling through mTOR, we sought to determine how RTP801 and RTP801L function in the context of known constituents of the mTOR pathway. The serine/threonine AKT is a key positive regulator of mTOR that functions by phosphorylating and inactivating the tuberous sclerosis gene product TSC2, a negative regulator of mTOR (9Inoki K. Li Y. Zhu T. Wu J. Guan K.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 648-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar, 20Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar, 21Potter C.J. Pedraza L.G. Xu T. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that overexpression of RTP801 and RTP801L in HEK293 cells has little effect on the phosphorylation and activation state of a co-expressed Akt construct, although the basal activity of the AKT construct is sufficient to activate S6K (Fig. 3A). Consistently, RNAi oligonucleotides directed against RTP801 and RTP801L have little effect on the phosphorylation of endogenous Akt or a downstream target of Akt, GSK3β (Fig. 2B). Moreover, RTP801 and RTP801L inhibited AKT-induced S6K phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effect of RTP801L expression on S6K phosphorylation was effectively reversed by co-transfection of RNAi oligonucleotides, and RTP801L siRNA also abolished the expression of co-transfected HA-RTP801L (Fig. 3B). Collectively, these results indicate that RTP801 and RTP801L likely act downstream of AKT in mammalian cells. We also tested the relationship of RTP801 and RTP801L to AMPK, another known constituent of the mTOR pathway (17Inoki K. Zhu T. Guan K.L. Cell. 2003; 115: 577-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). To perform this experiment, we used a pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK (commonly known as Compound C) that specifically inhibits AMPK and not its upstream kinase LKB1 (30Zhou G. Myers R. Li Y. Chen Y. Shen X. Fenyk-Melody J. Wu M. Ventre J. Doebber T. Fujii N. Musi N. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Moller D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (4432) Google Scholar, 31Corradetti M.N. Inoki K. Bardeesy N. DePinho R.A. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1533-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Overexpressed RTP801 and RTP801L were still able to inhibit S6K phosphorylation in the presence of Compound C, albeit not as fully as in the absence of the compound (Fig. 3D). In addition, siRNA directed against RTP801 and RTP801L did not have a significant effect on AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these data imply that RTP801 and RTP801L do not act upstream of AMPK. However, from these data we cannot distinguish whether RTP801 and RTP801L act downstream of AMPK or parallel to AMPK. To determine the relationship between RTP801, RTP801L, and TSC2, we down-regulated the endogenous TSC2 protein with siRNA oligonucleotides. The results indicate that RTP801 and RTP801L were unable to fully inhibit S6K in the presence of TSC2 RNAi oligonucleotides (Fig. 4A). To further test the functional relationship between RTP801, RTP801L, and TSC2, we co-expressed RTP801 and RTP801L via retroviral infection in TSC2+/+ and TSC2–/– cells. Our results show that co-expression of RTP801 and RTP801L cause a reduction in endogenous S6K phosphorylation in TSC2+/+ cells but not TSC2–/– cells (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these data, RTP801 and RTP801L are unable to suppress S6K in the presence of overexpressed Rheb, the downstream target of TSC2 (Fig. 4C). The inability of RTP801 and RTP801L to suppress S6K was observed in the presence of either wild-type Rheb or Rheb L64, a more active mutant of Rheb. Therefore, RTP801 and RTP801L function upstream of TSC2 and Rheb to inhibit mTOR signaling. While RTP801 and RTP801L function similarly to inhibit signaling through the mammalian target of rapamycin, it is not likely that they are regulated by all the same agonists, since the organization of their respective promoters are different. Significantly more is known about regulation of RTP801 than RTP801L, possibly due to the decreased stability of RTP801L relative to RTP801 (24Ellisen L.W. Ramsayer K.D. Johannessen C.M. Yang A. Beppu H. Minda K. Oliner J.D. McKeon F. Haber D.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 995-1005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). RTP801 transcription has been shown to be rapidly up-regulated by hypoxia via the hypoxia inducible factor HIF1 (26Shoshani T. Faerman A. Mett I. Zelin E. Tenne T. Gorodin S. Moshel Y. Elbaz S. Budanov A. Chajut A. Kalinski H. Kamer I. Rozen A. Mor O. Keshet E. Leshkowitz D. Einat P. Skaliter R. Feinstein E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2283-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that RTP801 is up-regulated by treatment with the glucocorticoid drug dexamethasone (27Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone have been shown to cause a robust inhibition of S6K in cells that express the glucocorticoid receptor (33Shah O.J. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Romanelli A. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2525-2533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 34Monfar M. Blenis J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1107-1115PubMed Google Scholar), implying that the immunosuppresive effects of the mTOR-targeting drug rapamycin and glucocorticoid receptor-targeting drug dexamethasone may at least partially share a mechanism of action. Thus we speculate that since RTP801 (also called dexamethasone-induced gene 2, dig2) has been shown to be rapidly and stably up-regulated by dexamethasone (27Wang Z. Malone M.H. Thomenius M.J. Zhong F. Xu F. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27053-27058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is possible that dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of S6K works through a mechanism that requires RTP801. In addition, it has been well established that in response to DNA damage, cellular transcription of many genes is dramatically reduced through a mechanism that requires the transcription factor p53. Much less work has been performed on the regulation of translation in response to DNA damage, but it has been shown that several DNA damaging agents cause inhibition of signaling through mTOR (35Tee A.R. Proud C.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3021-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 36Proud C.G. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 927-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Since it has also been shown that a variety of DNA damaging agents, including etoposide, ionizing radiation, and the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate cause a rapid and stable increase in the transcription of RTP801 (24Ellisen L.W.

It will be critical in the future to determine how the structure of RTP801 and RTP801L leads to inhibition of signaling through mTOR. RTP801 and RTP801L possess little detectable homology to known protein domains. It remains unclear whether these proteins possess catalytic function, whether they serve as adaptor proteins, or whether they have some other, unknown mechanism of action. It also remains to be seen whether RTP801 and RTP801L somehow affect TSC2 GAP activity. The fact that RNAi against either RTP801 or RTP801L elevated S6K phosphorylation more dramatically in cells cultured in older medium than fresh medium (data not shown) suggests that these two gene products may play a more prominent role in mTOR regulation under poor growth conditions as opposed to rich conditions. Both the overexpression and down-regulation experiments described in this report demonstrate that RTP801 and RTP801L play a role to inhibit the mTOR pathway (Fig. 4D). It should be noted that, during the course of this study, similar observations were also made by Brugarolas et al. (37Brugarolas J. Lei K. Hurley R.L. Manning B.D. Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Witters L.A. Ellisen L.W. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2893-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Both studies indicate that RTP801 and RTP801L act upstream of TSC2, Rheb, and mTOR and possibly downstream of AKT. These results are consistent with genetic studies by Reiling and Hafen (23Reiling J.H. Hafen E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2879-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that Scylla and Charybdis, the Drosophila homologs of RTP801 and RTP801L, down-regulate the TOR pathway in Drosophila. Thus, RTP801 and RTP801L should be considered as potential upstream mediators of signals caused by stressors to mTOR, but it is clear that the molecular mechanism of RTP801 and RTP801L in mTOR inhibition requires further investigation. We thank the members of the Guan laboratory for critical reading of this manuscript and insightful discussions. We also thank Leif Ellisen for providing the RTP801 antibody."

Binding of β-arrestin to the receptor is a prerequisite for subsequent receptor desensitization, internalization via clathrin-coated pits, and the initiation of alternative signaling pathways. In this study we have investigated the interactions between receptors and β-arrestin2 in living cells using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. We show that (a) the initial kinetics of β-arrestin2 binding to the receptor is limited by the kinetics of GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation; (b) repeated stimulation leads to the accumulation of GRK2-phosphorylated receptor, which can bind β-arrestin2 very rapidly; and (c) the interaction of β-arrestin2 with the receptor depends on the activation of the receptor by agonist because agonist withdrawal leads to swift dissociation of the receptor-β-arrestin2 complex. This fast agonist-controlled association and dissociation of β-arrestins from prephosphorylated receptors should permit rapid control of receptor sensitivity in repeatedly stimulated cells such as neurons.

This fast agonist-controlled association and dissociation of β-arrestins from prephosphorylated receptors should permit rapid control of receptor sensitivity in repeatedly stimulated cells such as neurons. A major mechanism for switching off many G-protein-coupled receptors is homologous desensitization. Homologous desensitization is a two-step process (1Benovic J.L. Kühn H. Weyand I. Codina J.

First, agonist-activated receptors become substrates for G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), 1The abbreviations used are: GRK, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; eCFP and eYFP, enhanced CFP and YFP; α2A-AR, α2A-adrenergic receptor; α2A-cam, a mutant of the α2A-AR carrying a YFP in the third intracellular loop and a CFP at the C terminus; βArr2, β-arrestin2 (also called arrestin3); β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer. which phosphorylate serine and threonine residues in the C terminus or the intracellular loops of the receptors. The phosphorylated receptors then bind β-arrestins, and this interaction uncouples the receptors from their G-proteins and thereby blocks signaling to G-proteins. In addition to blocking “classical” receptor-G-protein signaling, β-arrestin binding to receptors can also mediate the activation of “novel” signaling pathways (often involving tyrosine kinases) and the targeting of the receptors to clathrin-coated pits. This targeting is then followed by internalization to endosomes and (after dephosphorylation (2Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

A detailed investigation of homologous desensitization has been difficult to achieve because of the lack of good methods to monitor and quantify its extent. In particular, the interaction between receptors and β-arrestins has been difficult to quantify in intact cells. Initial experiments utilized co-immunoprecipitation of receptors and β-arrestins (9Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K.

More recently, resonance energy transfer methods have been developed to quantify receptor-arrestin interaction (reviewed in Ref. 11Eidne K.A. Kroeger K.M. Hanyaloglu A.C. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 415-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It has been shown that both bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) are suitable methods to quantify the interaction between receptors and β-arrestins (12Angers S.

Screen. 2004; 9: 322-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In general, FRET is most frequently applied between a CFP-tagged donor (e.g. the β-arrestin) and a YFP-tagged acceptor fluorophor (e.g. the receptor). In unstimulated cells, the receptor resides in the plasma membrane, whereas β-arrestin is located in the cytosol (10Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). During agonist-induced desensitization β-arrestin translocates to the plasma membrane and forms a complex with the receptor. The spatial proximity of the two proteins brings CFP and YFP close together, which, upon excitation of the CFP, leads to FRET. Studies published so far have measured bioluminescence energy transfer (12Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) between G-protein-coupled receptors and arrestins in populations consisting of at least thousands of cells. In this article, we show that FRET between the β2-adrenergic receptor and β-arrestin can be detected with high temporal resolution in individual intact cells. Using the β2AR as a model system, we find that (a) the rate-limiting step of the formation of the β-arrestin-receptor complex is receptor phosphorylation by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), (b) washout of agonist results in dissociation of the complex, and (c) repeated short term stimulation of a cell leads to accumulation of phosphorylated receptors that can interact very rapidly with β-arrestin when agonist is added again. Therefore, the desensitization kinetics of “used” receptors is quite different from the desensitization kinetics of “naive” receptors. We speculate that this fast mode of receptor desensitization may be important in settings where receptors are stimulated in a pulsed manner, e.g. in synapses. Cell Lines and DNA Constructs—HEK293 cells stably expressing a conformational sensor of the murine α2A-adrenergic receptor (α2A-cam) (17Vilardaga J.-P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J.

Gagnon A.W. Penn R.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and the α2A-cam (17Vilardaga J.-P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar), respectively. Briefly, the stop codon was replaced with an XbaI site (TCTAGA), and the coding sequences of eCFP and eYFP except for the N-terminal methionine were appended in-frame. In additional constructs, eCFP and eYFP were also fused in front of the β-arrestin2 open reading frame, yielding CFP-βArr2 and YFP-βArr2, respectively. All constructs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing. FRET Measurements—The α2A-cam was stably expressed in HEK293 cells as described previously (17Vilardaga J.-P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). For all other measurements, HEK293 cells on 65-mm plates were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The ratio between receptor DNA and βArr2-CFP DNA was varied between 2:1 and 1:1. If GRK2 DNA was present, the ratio between receptor and GRK2 DNA was 3:1. 6 h after transfection, cells were split on round polylysine-coated coverslips (24 mm diameter), and experiments were performed after a further 18 h. The coverslips were mounted on an Axiovert 135 inverted microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using an “Attofluor” holder (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), and the cells were continuously superfused with HBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, 2.5 mm KCl, 4 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2). The superfusion system has been described previously (17Vilardaga J.-P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Cells were observed using an oil immersion 63× lens, a polychrome IV (Till Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany) for excitation, and a dual emission photometric system (Till Photonics). To minimize photobleaching, the illumination time was set to 10–40 ms applied with a frequency of 10 Hz if not stated otherwise. Fluorescence was measured at 535 ± 15 nm (F535) and 480 ± 20 nm (F480) (beam splitter DCLP 505 nm, Chroma Technology, Rockingham, VT) upon excitation at 436 ± 10 nm (beam splitter DCLP 460 nm, Chroma Technology). Signals detected by avalanche photodiodes were digitized using an analog/digital converter (Digidata 1322A, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and stored on PC using Clampex 8.1 software (Axon Instruments). The emission intensities were corrected by the respective spillover of CFP into the YFP channel and direct YFP excitation (spillover of YFP into the CFP channel was negligible) to give corrected intensities FCFP and FYFP. FRET was calculated as the ratio FYFP/FCFP. Ligands were applied using the superfusion system. Kinetics were fitted with monoexponential functions using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in Kaleidagraph 3.6 (Synergy Software). Confocal Microscopy—Confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica TCS SP2 system. HEK cells were transfected as above and split on round polylysine-coated coverslips that were mounted on a custom-built holder. YFP was excited with the 514 nm line of an argon laser and images were taken with a 63× lens using the factory settings for YFP. Fluorescence loss in the cytoplasm over time was quantified using the Leica confocal software or ImageJ (NIH Image software) as described by Oakley et al. (24Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Biochemical Assays—Receptor phosphorylation was measured in HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged β2AR and human GRK2 as described previously (21Dicker F. Quitterer U. Winstel R. Honold K. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5476-5481Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 25Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. Quitterer U. Nature. 2003; 426: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Briefly, the transfected cells were incubated in phosphate-free DMEM and loaded with [32P]orthophosphate. Cells were stimulated or not with 1 μm isoproterenol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 min. Subsequently, alprenolol (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the cells were incubated for a further 2 min at 37 °C. Incorporation of phosphate into the receptor was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. β2AR cell surface expression was measured using [3H]CGP12177 (Amersham Biosciences) binding to intact cells (25Lorenz K. Lohse M.J. Quitterer U. Nature. 2003; 426: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 26Staehelin M. Simons P. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for various times with 1 μm isoproterenol. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold HBS and incubated with the radioactive ligand for 2 h at 4 °C to determine the amount of cell surface receptors. Background binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm alprenolol. It was shown previously that HEK293 cells transiently transfected with βArr2-GFP fusion proteins and β2ARs will translocate the fluorescent protein to the plasma membrane upon stimulation of the receptor (10Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Time-lapse confocal microscopy with HEK293 cells transiently transfected with β2AR and βArr2-YFP showed that stimulation of the receptors with an agonist caused a translocation of β-arrestin2 to the cell surface (Fig. 1A and supplemental movie S1). This translocation was essentially complete after 1 min, which is in agreement with earlier data (27Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14498-14506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Quantification of the translocation showed a time constant of 2.16 ± 0.06 min-1 (Fig. 1A). Agonist washout resulted in redistribution of βArr2-YFP back to the cytosol which was always partial and very variable between cells. An example trace is shown in Fig. 1B. Can the interaction between a suitably tagged receptor and β-arrestin be detected by FRET between YFP- and CFP-tagged proteins? To investigate this question, the β2AR was tagged with CFP or YFP at the C terminus to yield β2AR-CFP and β2AR-YFP, respectively. The biological properties of β2AR-GFP fusion proteins in comparison with the wild-type receptor have been investigated extensively (10Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 28McLean A.J. Milligan G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Although these proteins are unable to recycle back to the plasma membrane due to the absence of a PDZ binding motif at the extreme C terminus (29Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), their binding, signaling, and internalization properties are very similar to those of the wild-type receptor. βArr2 was tagged with CFP or YFP at either the N or the C terminus, which yielded CFP-βArr2 and YFP-βArr2 (N-terminally tagged) as well as βArr2-CFP and βArr2-YFP (C-terminally tagged). We have shown earlier that all four fluorescent β-arrestins undergo agonist-induced translocation to the parathyroid hormone receptor (22Vilardaga J.-P. Frank M. Krasel C. Dees C. Nissenson R.A. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33435-33443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), suggesting that βArr2 can be tagged at either the N or the C terminus without loss of receptor binding. To further demonstrate that the tagged β-arrestins are functional, we showed that βArr2-CFP was able to enhance the internalization of β2AR in a manner similar to what has been reported for untagged βArr2 (Fig. 2). To measure FRET, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with one of the following combinations: 1) combinations where only the receptor was tagged (β2AR-CFP + βArr2, β2AR-YFP + βArr2); 2) combinations where only the β-arrestin was tagged (β2AR + βArr2-CFP, β2AR + βArr2-YFP); 3) combinations containing receptor and β-arrestin tagged with the same color (β2AR-CFP + βArr2-CFP, β2AR-YFP + βArr2-YFP); and 4) combinations containing receptor and β-arrestin tagged with different colors (β2AR-CFP + YFP-βArr2, β2AR-CFP + βArr2-YFP, β2AR-YFP + CFP-βArr2 and β2AR-YFP + βArr2-CFP). One day later, cells were excited at 436 nm and the fluorescence emissions at 480 and 535 nm (FCFP and FYFP; see “Experimental Procedures”), and the ratio FYFP/FCFP was determined. If agonist-induced binding of β-arrestin2 to the receptor results in FRET, this should be visible as an increase of FYFP/FCFP upon addition of agonist. In all cells expressing only a single fluorescent protein and in cells expressing identically colored receptor and β-arrestin2, excitation at 436 nm caused very little emission at 535 nm (YFP), and agonists did not elicit any changes in FYFP/FCFP. In contrast, when cells expressing any of the four combinations consisting of receptor and β-arrestin2 tagged with different colors were excited at 436 nm, a significant emission of yellow light was observed in the presence of agonist (data not shown), suggesting that agonist-induced FRET between the two fluorophores had occurred. The most robust agonist-induced changes were measured for the combination β2AR-YFP + βArr2-CFP, which was therefore used in all subsequent experiments. To confirm that the change in FYFP/FCFP was indeed due to FRET between β2AR-YFP and βArr2-CFP, we photobleached the acceptor (YFP) and monitored FCFP. Bleaching the YFP by illumination with 500 nm light in the continuous presence of isoproterenol led to an increase in CFP fluorescence, as expected for FRET (Fig. 3). Continuous monitoring of the fluorescence intensities allowed us to investigate the kinetics of the receptor/β-arrestin2 interaction. A representative trace of an experiment derived from observation of a single cell expressing β2AR-YFP and βArr2-CFP is shown in Fig. 4A. Upon short term agonist stimulation (<120 s), a slow increase in the ratio FYFP/FCFP was observed, which was due to a simultaneous increase in FYFP and a decrease in FCFP, as would be expected for FRET. The rate constant of this increase was 2.10 ± 0.60 min-1, corresponding to a t0.5 of 19.6 s (n = 6). This is virtually identical to the rate constant of β-arrestin2 translocation to the membrane as observed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1). When the agonist was washed out, the ratio decreased to approximately its initial value. This suggests that the existence of the complex between the β2AR and βArr2 in living cells requires the continuous presence of agonist. Complex dissociation could also be achieved by superfusing cells with an antagonist instead of buffer (data not shown). Fig. 4A was obtained with co-transfected human GRK2. When dominant-negative GRK2 (the K220R mutant) was co-transfected instead, no agonist-induced FRET was observed (Fig. 4B). When no GRK2 was co-transfected, changes in FRET were visible but were much less robust than with co-transfected GRK2 (data not shown). Furthermore, a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of the β2AR (19Bouvier M. Hausdorff W.P. De Blasi A. O'Dowd B.F. Kobilka B.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1988; 333: 370-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) was unable to elicit any agonist-induced FRET (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that GRK-mediated phosphorylation is required for a functional interaction between the β2-adrenergic receptor and β-arrestin2. In the experiments shown thus far, the agonist was applied for a short time, never exceeding 2 min. If cells were superfused with the agonist for extended times, we observed that after several minutes, FRET started to decline again, reaching its basal value after ∼30 min (Fig. 5A). However, in translocation assays, the association of βArr2-YFP with the membrane remained stable over this time range (Fig. 5B), consistent with observations by others (see for example Ref. 30Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar for a 60-min stimulation). The difference between the two experiments is that the tagging of β2AR with YFP (which is required for the FRET experiment) destroys a PDZ-binding domain at the extreme C terminus of the receptor, which is present in the wild-type receptor used for the translocation experiment. This PDZ-binding domain is important for recycling of the receptor to the plasma membrane (29Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Thus, in the FRET experiment the decrease of receptor levels at the plasma membrane should be more dramatic, which would lead to a pronounced loss of β-arrestin2 binding sites. When a single cell was repeatedly superfused with isoproterenol, we observed that the first stimulation resulted in a fairly slow FRET signal (see above), whereas subsequent stimulations caused much faster signals (kobs 19.5 ± 2.4 min-1, corresponding to a t0.5 of 2.1 s (n = 18)) (Fig. 6A, upper panel). The kinetics of the subsequent stimulations appeared identical. This suggests that the speed of complex formation between β2AR-YFP and βArr2-CFP was greatly enhanced by prior stimulation(s) of the receptor. Using a mutant of βArr2 that can bind to agonist-activated β2ARs in a phosphorylation-independent manner (R170E (18Celver J. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Chavkin C. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9043-9048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar)), the kinetic difference between first and subsequent stimulations was abolished; we always observed a rapid increase in agonist-induced FRET (Fig. 6A, lower panel), the speed of which was comparable with the second and subsequent binding of wild-type βArr2-CFP to the receptors (kobs 26.6 ± 5.9 min-1; n = 6) (Fig. 6B). In contrast to the association rates, the dissociation rates after the first and subsequent stimulations were indistinguishable (kobs of first dissociation 2.88 ± 0.54 min-1 (n = 7), kobs of subsequent dissociations 3.96 ± 0.54 min-1 (n = 13), p > 0.2 (Student's t test; when all 20 experiments were averaged, kobs was 3.60 ± 0.42 min-1, corresponding to a t0.5 of 11.6 s). These experiments show that the time-limiting step for arrestin binding is GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor. This would explain why the phosphorylation-independent R170E mutant of β-arrestin2 showed much faster binding to the receptor upon addition of agonist. Furthermore, after short term agonist stimulation and subsequent washout, the receptors appeared to remain phosphorylated at the cell surface. This phosphorylation alone was not sufficient for β-arrestin2 binding to the receptor, and the complex dissociated when the agonist was washed out. Upon subsequent agonist application, the receptor was already phosphorylated, which permitted much faster formation of the receptor-β-arrestin2 complex. Do prephosphorylated receptors indeed accumulate in cells after short agonist stimulation? We sought to answer this question by measuring β2-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation in intact cells. HEK293 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged β2AR (20Guan X.M. Kobilka T.S. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and GRK2 were stimulated for 1 min with 1 μm isoproterenol. To mimic the washout of agonist in the superfusion system, cells were then treated with the neutral antagonist alprenolol (10 μm) for another 2 min. Subsequently, receptor phosphorylation in these cells was determined by immunoprecipitation and compared with receptor phosphorylation in cells that had been stimulated but not undergone the agonist washout procedure. Fig. 7 shows a robust increase in receptor phosphorylation after a 1-min stimulation of cells with agonist that was somewhat reduced after 2 min of alprenolol addition. These results indicate that short stimulation of cells may indeed lead to the accumulation of phosphorylated receptors, the majority of which remains phosphorylated for at least 2 min. As illustrated in Figs. 4 and 6, removal of agonist leads to dissociation of the receptor-β-arrestin2 complex. To clarify whether the observed dissociation kinetics is an intrinsic property of the receptor-β-arrestin2 complex, we compared isoproterenol with two other agonists at the β2-adrenergic receptor, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The affinities of isoproterenol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine for the human β2AR are 0.5, 0.7, and 26 μm, respectively, and all three ligands are full agonists (31Del Carmine R. Ambrosio C.

Concentrations of 10-fold KD (i.e. 5 μm isoproterenol, 7.5 μm epinephrine, and 250 μm norepinephrine) induced an increase in FRET between β2AR-YFP and βArr2-CFP, although this increase was always reduced in the case of norepinephrine (Fig. 8A). The kinetics of loss of FRET after agonist washout was dependent on the identity of the agonist (Fig. 8B); norepinephrine washout resulted in the fastest dissociation of the receptor-β-arrestin2 complex (kobs 19.2 ± 3.0 min-1, n = 7), whereas isoproterenol washout resulted in the slowest dissociat"
https://openalex.org/W2007131731,"Copper is essential for brain metabolism, serving as a cofactor to superoxide dismutase, dopamine-β-hydroxylase, amyloid precursor protein, ceruloplasmin, and other proteins required for normal brain function. The copper-transporting ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B play a central role in distribution of copper in the central nervous system; genetic mutations in ATP7A and ATP7B lead to severe neurodegenerative disorders, Menkes disease and Wilson disease, respectively. Although both ATP7A and ATP7B are required, their specific roles and regulation in the brain remain poorly understood. Using high-resolution imaging and functional assays, we demonstrate that ATP7A and ATP7B show cell-specific distribution in adult cerebellum, have distinct enzymatic characteristics, and are regulated differently during development. ATP7B is continuously expressed in Purkinje neurons (PN) where it delivers copper to the ferroxidase ceruloplasmin. ATP7A is a faster copper transporter than Wilson disease protein as evidenced by faster rates of catalytic reactions. The expression of ATP7A switches during development from PN to Bergmann glia, the cells supporting PN function in adult brain.

Copper is an important nutrient for normal brain homeostasis serving as a cofactor of key metabolic enzymes involved in mitochondrial function, neurotransmitter biosynthesis, oxidative stress defense, and iron transport (1Frieden E. Clin. Physiol. Biochem. 1986; 4: 11-19PubMed Google Scholar). It plays additional and poorly understood roles in neuronal myelination (2Prodan C.I. Holland N.R. Wisdom P.J. Burstein S.A. Bottomley S.S. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1453-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and in regulation or function of the prion and amyloid precursor proteins (3Multhaup G. Schlicksupp A.

Res. 2004; 37: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Abnormal copper homeostasis is the primary cause of Menkes disease (MNK) 1The abbreviations used are: MNK, Menkes disease; WND, Wilson disease; MNKP, MNK protein; WNDP, WND protein; CP, ceruloplasmin; PN, Purkinje neuron; BG, Bergmann glia; P, postnatal day. and Wilson disease (WND), severe metabolic disorders with marked neurological manifestations (5Scheinberg H.

Despite the essential role of copper, very little is currently known about copper transport in either normal or diseased human brain. As a result, the molecular mechanisms underlying the MNK- and WND-related neurodegeneration remain essentially uncharacterized. MNK and WND are associated with mutations in copper-transporting P-type ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B, respectively (We will refer to ATP7A and ATP7B as Menkes disease protein, MNKP, and Wilson disease protein, WNDP). MNKP and WNDP are central for the regulation of copper distribution in human cells, and their general functions are very similar. Both proteins utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport copper from the cytosol into the secretory pathway thus participating in the biosynthesis of copper-dependent enzymes. In peripheral tissues, MNKP was shown to transport copper to tyrosinase in melanocytes (8Petris M.J. Strausak D. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2845-2851Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), whereas WNDP delivers copper to a ferroxidase ceruloplasmin in the liver (9Terada K. Nakako T. Yang X.L. Iida M. Aiba N. Minamiya Y. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Miura N. Sugiyama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1815-1820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, MNKP and WNDP regulate the intracellular copper concentration by trafficking to either plasma membrane (MNKP) or to vesicles (WNDP) and exporting excess copper from the cells (10Petris M.J. Mercer J.F.B. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 11Roelofsen H. Wolters H. Van-Luyn M.J. Miura N. Kuipers F.

In the central nervous system, the functional relationship between two copper-transporting ATPases is poorly understood. Current data suggest that MNKP controls the overall copper supply to the brain through its localization in choroid plexus (12Iwase T. Nishimura M. Sugimura H.H.I. Ozsawa F. Shinmura K. Suzuki M. Tanaka M. Kino I. Acta Neuropathol. 1996; 91: 482-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and also has a biosynthetic role in pituitary gland where it mediates copper delivery to peptidyl-glycine α-amidating monooxygenase (13Stevenson T.C.

What physiological functions the copper-transporting ATPases have in other brain regions and what the relationship is between MNKP and WNDP in either adult or developing brain remain unknown. Spatial and temporal differences in the expression of copper-transporting ATPases have been observed in tissues of mouse embryo (14Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Packman S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 7: 1043-1049Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar); however the developmental regulation of WNDP and MNKP has never been examined in detail and never within the CNS. To address these important issues, we have focused our attention on cerebellum, one of the critical regions of the brain expressing both MNKP and WNDP and several copper-requiring proteins. Using fluorescent imaging with a single cell resolution and functional analysis, we demonstrate that two copper-transporting ATPases, MNKP and WNDP, have distinct roles in cerebellum and that the copper distribution pathways in Purkinje neurons and Bergmann glia are tightly linked. These results have important implication for understanding of the Wilson disease and Menkes disease pathologies. Mouse Strains—The generation of Atp7b-/- mice has been described previously (15Buiakova O.I. Xu J. Lutsenko S. Zeitlin S. Das K. Das S. Ross B.M. Mekios C. Scheinberg I.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The Atp7b-/- and wild-type C57BLx129SV/SvEv mice were housed at the OHSU Department of Comparative Medicine according to the National Institutes of Health guidelines on the use of laboratory and experimental animals. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Animals were either perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde for the in situ hybridization studies or euthanized by CO2 inhalation for Western blotting experiments, and the livers and cerebellum were quickly removed. Mice of either sex were used for the experiments. Unless specified, adult wild-type and Atp7b-/- mice were 10 weeks of age. In Situ Hybridization—The brains were removed following perfusion, soaked for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde, 20% sucrose, then 30% sucrose and then embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound (Tissue-Tek, Torrance, CA) at -20 °C. Sagittal sections of 20 μm were sliced and placed onto gelatin/poly-l-lysine-coated slides. The slides were treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with an avidin/biotin blocking kit following manufacturer's instructions (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline/diethyl pyrocarbonate, 100 mm glycine/diethyl pyrocarbonate and 0.3% Triton X-100. Following treatment with 1 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min, slides were incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde followed by a 10-min incubation with 0.25% anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine. For prehybridization, slides were incubated in hybridization solution (2× sodium chloride and sodium citrate solution (SSC), 50% deionized formamide, 1% Sarkosyl, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 50 mm phosphate buffer, 250 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 500 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50 μm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 2 h. After prehybridization, biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probes at 200 ng/ml were added and incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidity chamber. Excess probes were removed by stringent washes in SSC, blocked in blocking buffer (TBT, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and incubated with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. For signal detection, fluorescein isothiocyanate and cynanine 3 (Cy3) Tyramide Signal Amplification system kits were used (Life Sciences, Rockville, MA). Samples were then mounted using Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). Immunohistochemistry—The 20-μm sagittal tissue sections were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in blocking buffer (5% serum of secondary antibody, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline). Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody diluted 1:5000 in dilution buffer (0.25% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline). Following washes, slides were incubated for 1 h in fluorescently labeled secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey antirat IgG for anti-WNDP or Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG for anti-MNKP or Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-goat for anti-ceruloplasmin (CP), Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Sections were washed, mounted using Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and analyzed using a Zeiss confocal scanning microscope. Expression of WNDP and MNKP in Sf9 Cells—Expression of WNDP in Sf9 cells has been described previously (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To generate the recombinant baculovirus expressing MNKP, the 4.6-kb full-length MNKP fragment was cloned into the pFastBactDual vector (Invitrogen) using BamHI cloning sites. The recombinant baculovirus was generated using the Bac-to-Bac kit (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Expression of MNKP in Sf9 cells was verified by Western-blotting using rabbit anti-MNKP antibodies that were raised against purified nucleotide-binding domain of MNKP. Functional Comparison of MNKP and WNDP—Phosphorylation of WNDP and MNKP using [γ-32P]ATP was performed as described previously (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using preparations of the membrane-bound MNKP or WNDP in the 20 mm Bis-Tris-propane, pH 6.0, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2 buffer (reaction buffer). Experiments on measuring the kinetic and ATP dependence of enzyme phosphorylation were conducted as published before (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For the dephosphorylation experiments, the proteins were first phosphorylated for 2 min with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP, and the aliquot of reaction was taken as the zero time point. Cold ATP was then added to 25 μm, and the reaction was allowed to proceeded on ice at the time intervals indicated on Fig. 3C. The proteins were then acid-precipitated, and their level of phosphorylation was analyzed following gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described previously (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To compare copper dependences of catalytic phosphorylation, 50 μg of WNDP- or MNKP-containing membrane preparations were resuspended in 200 μl of reaction buffer plus 250 μm bathocuproinedisulfonic acid disodium salt and incubated on ice for 15 min. Then mixture was spun down for 10 min at 20,000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of reaction buffer containing 100 μm ascorbate, 100 μm Tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate, and CuCl2 as indicated in Fig. 4. The mixture was incubated on ice for 15 min and then phosphorylation was performed as described above using with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP for 4 min on ice. Detection of ApoCP and Holo-CP Using Western Blotting—Liver pieces (5 mm × 5 mm) and whole cerebellum from the wild-type or Atp7b-/- mice were homogenized in 500 μl of the homogenization buffer, 25 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, and 1 tablet of Roche complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g. The pellet was discarded, and the soluble portion was further centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 × g. For liver samples, 50 μg of soluble portion was used, and for cerebellum, 60 μg of membrane fraction was utilized for separation on 4–20% Trisglycine gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and immunostained using anti-CP antibody (Sigma). The Expression of MNKP and WNDP in Adult Cerebellum Is Cell-specific—To determine the localization of MNKP and WNDP in cerebellum, we analyzed the distribution of their mRNAs using in situ hybridization with tyramide amplification. Three non-overlapping oligonucleotide probes for MNKP mRNA and two probes for WNDP mRNA were utilized (Table I). Probes corresponding to the reverse sequence of the sense strain were used as a negative control (Table II). All antisense probes for MNKP mRNA, used together or individually, produced staining characteristic of Bergmann glia, whereas the control probes yielded no detectable signal (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the WNDP-related signals were evident in Purkinje neurons (PN), quite distinctive from Bergmann glia (BG), and no PN staining was detected using the control probe (Fig. 1B). The marked difference between the MNKP and WNDP mRNA patterns strongly pointed to a cell-type specific distribution of MNKP and WNDP in adult cerebellum.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for the in situ hybridization experiments Sequence of anti-sense probes used in fluorescent in situ hybridization.ProbeSequenceMnkP1GATCATTTCTTCATTACTCATGTTCTGATTATGGTGAAGAGTTGCAAGGTGMnkP2GCATCAATTTGAACCAGGGATGCATTTTTAATGTTATTTTCTTCTATCTTCAMnkP3ACTCCTCTGTCCTGTGTGGCTCCGGGGATGCAACTCATAATTGTCATACGTWndP1CCCCAGGGTCTCAAAATGATTGGAAATCTGGACAGGAGAGACCGTCTCTTWndP2ACTCAGGGGCTTCATGCGGCCGTGGGCCTGGGCCTCATATCTCTCTAGGTC Open table in a new tab Table IIOligonucleotide primers used for the in situ hybridization experiments Sequence of probes used for negative control in fluorescent in situ hybridization.ProbeSequenceMnkP1CTAGTAAAGAAGTAATGAGTACAAGACTAATACCACTTCTCAACGTTCCACMnkP2CGTAGTTAAACTTGGTCCCTACGTAAAAATTACAATAAAAGAAGATAGAATMnkP3ACTCCTCTGTCCTGTGTGGCTCCGGGGATGCAACTCATAATTGTCATACGTWndP1GGGGTCCCAGAGTTTTACTAACCTTTAGACCTGTCCTGTCTGGCAGAGAAAWndP2TGAGTCCCCGAAGTACGCCGGCACCCGGACCCGGAGTATAGAGAGATCCG Open table in a new tab This result was confirmed by the immunohistochemistry experiments. The anti-MNKP antibody stained small cell bodies along the molecular layer, as expected for BG (Fig. 1C). This pattern was also identical to the immunostaining of the SK3 potassium channel, which is largely restricted to BG in cerebellum (Fig. 1C). 2J. Adelman, personal communication. The presence of WNDP protein in Purkinje neurons was similarly verified. The anti-WNDP antibody produced characteristic PN staining identical to the pattern of WNDP mRNA (Fig. 1, compare C with D) and to the mRNA expression pattern of a PN marker, the glutamate transporter mEAAT1 (17Amara S.G. Fontana A.C. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 41: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 18Sutherland M.L. Delaney T.A. Noebels J.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2191-2207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D). Thus, in the adult cerebellum, MNKP is expressed in Bergmann glia, whereas WNDP is present in Purkinje neurons. Co-expression with Ceruloplasmin Points to a Biosynthetic Function of WNDP—One of the functions of MNKP and WNDP in peripheral tissues is to deliver copper to the secretory pathway for incorporation into copper-requiring enzymes. CP is a copper-dependent ferroxidase, which is essential for iron homeostasis in the central nervous system (19Harris Z.L. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M. MacGillivray R.T. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2539-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 20Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. Jeong S.Y. Zhu Q. Julien J. David S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6578-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is synthesized in the cerebellum (21Klomp L.W. Farhangrazi Z.S. Dugan L.L. Gitlin J.D. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To determine which of the copper-transporting ATPases is involved in copper delivery for CP biosynthesis, we compared the cerebellar distribution of MNKP and WNDP with that of CP. Our experiments revealed that in the cerebellum CP is expressed primarily in Purkinje neurons with a weaker staining present in the basket cells and the granular layer but no detectable staining in Bergmann glia (Fig. 1D). Co-expression of WNDP and CP strongly suggests that WNDP participates in CP biosynthesis. We observed no co-localization of MNKP and CP, suggesting that the role of MNKP is distinct from that of WNDP. The Expression of MNKP Is Developmentally Regulated— Previous studies using 13-day-old mice pointed to MNKP expression in Purkinje neurons (22Murata Y. Kodama H. Abe T. Ishida N. Nishimura M. Levinson B. Gitschier J. Packman S. Pediatr. Res. 1997; 42: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) in contrast to our finding of MNKP restricted to Bergmann glia in the cerebellum of adult mice. This apparent discrepancy could be because of developmental changes occurring in MNKP expression. To test this possibility we examined the localization of MNKP in the cerebellum at the 2nd (P2), 13th (P13), and 18th (P18) day of postnatal development. We also compared the MNKP patterns of distribution with the expression of WNDP at the same stages. These experiments revealed markedly different distributions of MNKP mRNA in developing and adult cerebellum and also showed differences in the regulation of expression of MNKP and WNDP during development. At P2, MNKP mRNA is present in Purkinje neurons, where WNDP is also expressed (Fig. 2), suggesting that the early growth and development of these cells require the functioning of both copper-transporting ATPases. The localization of MNKP and WNDP in Purkinje neurons is also detected at P6 (our data, not shown) and P13 (Fig. 2). However later, at P18, a marked change occurs in MNKP expression. In addition to Purkinje neurons, the MNKP staining appears in Bergmann glia (Fig. 2, arrow) and is confined exclusively to Bergmann glia in the adult mice. In contrast, WNDP is consistently present in PN throughout development (Fig. 2), and the only change seen in WNDP patterns during development is an age-dependent decrease in the intensity of staining suggesting an age-related down-regulation of WNDP expression. Functional Properties of WNDP and MNKP Are Distinct— The presence of both MNKP and WNDP in PN during early development points to complementary functions of the copper-transporting ATPases in developing neurons, which could be associated with their different subcellular location in neurons. Alternatively, MNKP and WNDP might have distinct affinities for the substrate and/or different transport efficiency, which would help to achieve a more fine tuned regulation of intracellular copper. Examination of the MNKP and WNDP staining in PN did not reveal markedly different localization of these proteins, although further experiments are necessary to verify this conclusion. Consequently, we decided to compare the functional characteristics of MNKP and WNDP. Previous studies have suggested that MNKP may have higher turnover rate than WNDP (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F.

However, these experiments were performed using markedly different conditions (detergent-solubilized and immunoprecipitated MNKP (23Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar)) and expression in different cell types, all of which preclude accurate comparison. To overcome these problems, we expressed both MNKP and WNDP in Sf9 cells using baculovirus-mediated infection and then compared enzymatic characteristics of two copper ATPases in their membrane-bound form under identical conditions. The key steps in the MNKP and WNDP enzymatic cycle are transient phosphorylation and then dephosphorylation, which are coupled, respectively, with the binding and release of copper from the intramembrane sites (Fig. 3A) (16Tsivkovskii R. Eisses J.F. Kaplan J. Lutsenko S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 976-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Voskoboinik I. Mar J. Strausak D. Camakaris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28620-28627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Both steps can be monitored in vitro, and the kinetics of these reactions can be used to assess the relative turnover rates of MNKP and WNDP. Fig. 3B illustrates that under identical conditions phosphorylation of MNKP by ATP is ∼6-fold faster than WNDP phosphorylation (t½ = 0.095 + 0.018 and 0.59 + 0.25 min, n = 4, respectively). The dephosphorylation step is also considerably faster for MNKP (t½ = 0.35 + 0.14 min compared with 1.85 + 0.7 min for WNDP, n = 4) (Fig. 3C). These results suggest a significantly higher catalytic turnover rate for ATP hydrolysis (and hence copper transport) by MNKP. To verify that the distinct time dependences of partial reactions are not due to potential differences in the protein folding of recombinant WNDP and MNKP, we characterized an ATP dependence of catalytic phosphorylation for these two proteins. These experiments revealed that the apparent Km for ATP is essentially identical for WNDP and MNKP (1.1 + 0.3 and 1.0 + 0.4 μm, n = 3, respectively), indicating that both MNKP and WNDP bind the catalytic substrate with equally high affinity (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, the Km for copper, another substrate required for activation of phosphorylation, is lower for WNDP than for MNKP (1.1 ± 0.2 μm compared with 2.4 ± 0.7 μm, respectively, n = 5) suggesting that WNDP may bind copper more efficiently under copper-limiting conditions than MNKP (Fig. 4B). The Lack of Functional WNDP Results in the Switch of CP Expression from Purkinje Neurons to Bergmann Glia—MNKP and WNDP are structurally very similar sharing over 50% sequence identity (53% in mice). At the same time, our data demonstrate that these proteins have cell-specific distribution, differ in their developmental expression profiles, and have distinct functional properties. This raises the question as to whether or not there is any functional redundancy of these copper transporters in the cerebellum. To address this issue we utilized Atp7b-/- knock-out mice that lack functional WNDP (15Buiakova O.I. Xu J. Lutsenko S. Zeitlin S. Das K. Das S. Ross B.M. Mekios C. Scheinberg I.H. Gilliam T.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the inactivation of WNDP would disrupt the delivery of copper to CP in Purkinje neurons and, therefore, for MNKP to restore the copper delivery to CP it has to be expressed in PN instead of (or in addition to) Bergmann glia. However, the experiments revealed that in adult Atp7b-/- mice, the MNKP mRNA remains restricted to Bergmann glia (Fig. 5). In contrast, the distribution of CP is clearly changed. Unlike its expression in Purkinje neurons of wild-type mice, CP is present predominantly in Bergmann glia in the Atp7b-/- mice, suggesting that CP expression depends on the presence of a functional copper-ATPase in the cell. The switch in the expression of CP to Bergmann glia was verified by double labeling experiments using antibodies against CP and MNKP, or CP and the Bergmann glia marker SK3. Clear co-localization of both MNKP and CP, and of CP and SK3, was observed in the cerebellum of the Atp7b-/- mice (Fig. 6A). No PN staining was evident, confirming that the lack of copper-transporting activity by WNDP induces a switch in the expression of CP from Purkinje neurons to Bergmann glia, where the other copper transporter, MNKP, is active. It seemed likely that the change in CP expression from the WNDP-deficient neurons to the MNKP-containing Bergmann glia would restore copper delivery to CP via MNKP. To test this hypothesis we utilized the known property of CP to produce two protein bands corresponding to the copper-bound (holo-CP) and unbound forms (apoCP), when analyzed on a non-reducing gel (24Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the wild-type liver and cerebellum, the holo-CP and apoCP are both clearly visible (Fig. 6B). As expected, in the Atp7b-/- liver only apoCP is detected, because copper transport by WNDP is inactivated, and MNKP is not expressed in the liver. In contrast, in the cerebellum of the Atp7b-/- mice, there is little change in the amount of holo-CP compared with the wild-type. Thus, despite the lack of WNDP, copper is delivered to ceruloplasmin, most likely via MNKP. Defects in copper homeostasis have marked consequences for brain function; however, the copper distribution pathways in the normal and diseased brain remain essentially uncharacterized. Our results shed light on a functional relationship between two copper transporters, MNKP and WNDP, in the cerebellum. We demonstrated that MNKP and WNDP are both present in adult cerebellum, and their functions in this region of the brain are distinct. This conclusion is based on (i) cell-specific localization of MNKP and WNDP (in Bergmann glia and Purkinje neurons, respectively), (ii) co-localization of the copper-requiring enzyme CP with WNDP, but not with MNKP, and (iii) distinct functional characteristics and developmental regulation of the transporters. We propose that the major function of WNDP in cerebellum is to deliver copper to the copper-dependent ferroxidase CP, whereas the function of MNKP is likely to regulate copper concentration in Bergmann glia and perhaps also to export copper for delivery to Purkinje neurons. The localization of MNKP in Bergmann glia is a new and important finding. It has been confirmed by two independent methods (in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry), which yielded consistent BG patterns with a single cell resolution. Interestingly, in addition to localization in BG cell bodies, we also see MNKP mRNA in peripheral processes of BG. The peripheral mRNA localization may facilitate local control of protein synthesis in response to environmental cues (25Mothe A.J. Brown I.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 76: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), such as elevated copper. Under standard conditions, most of the MNKP protein is detected in the BG cell bodies. The amount of MNKP produced in processes, if any, is apparently too low to be detected by immunohistochemistry. We attribute the previously reported localization of MNKP in PN (26Murata Y. Kodama H. Mori Y. Kobayashi M. Abe T. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) to developmental changes in the expression of this protein, which we directly demonstrated in the present work. The switch in expression of MNKP from PN to BG occurs around day 18 of development, when the formation of close connections between BG and PN is being completed (27Reichenbach A. Siegel A. Rickmann M. Wolff J.R. Noone D. Robinson S.R. J. Hirnforsch. 1995; 36: 509-517PubMed Google Scholar). In the adult cerebellum, BG insulate PN maintaining the structure of PN and supplying trophic factors to these cells (27Reichenbach A. Siegel A. Rickmann M. Wolff J.R. Noone D. Robinson S.R. J. Hirnforsch. 1995; 36: 509-517PubMed Google Scholar, 28Furuya A. Tabata T. Mitoma J. Yamada K. Yamasaki M. Makino A. Yamamoto T. Watanabe M. Kano M. Hirabayashi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11528-11533Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). How copper is delivered to PN is currently unknown, but it is tempting to speculate that MNKP in Bergmann glia exports copper for further utilization by other cells, specifically by PN. This would parallel the role of MNKP in intestinal epithelia, where the major role of MNKP is to export copper for further utilization by other tissues. During the first 2 weeks after birth, MNKP is found mainly in PN along with WNDP. Why both ATPases are needed in developing neurons is not yet clear; however, a comparison of the functional properties of MNKP and WNDP offers some clues. The kinetic measurement suggests that MNKP is a faster copper transporter, because it undergoes both catalytic phosphorylation and dephosphorylation considerably faster than WNDP. Therefore, we hypothesize that MNKP plays a primary homeostatic role mediating efficient export of excess copper. Another potentially important difference in functional properties of MNKP and WNDP is their affinity for copper. The apparent Km of WNDP for copper is 2–3-fold lower than that for MNKP, which could be significant in vivo where there is essentially no free copper (29Prohaska J. Gybina A.A. J. Nutr. 2004; 135: 1003-1006Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The lower turnover and higher apparent affinity of WNDP for copper are consistent with its biosynthetic function. The metal delivery to the secretory pathway does not require high throughput but may significantly depend on the relatively high affinity of WNDP for copper under copper-limiting conditions. It is important to emphasize that, currently, the proposed relationship between different kinetic properties of MNKP and WNDP and their intracellular functions is only an attractive hypothesis, which requires further testing. Altogether, our results point to specific and non-overlapping roles of MNKP and WNDP in the wild-type cerebellum. Therefore, it seems particularly significant that in the Atp7b-/- mice, we observed functional compensation of WNDP by MNKP. The restoration of copper delivery to CP in the cerebellum of these mice occurs as a result of a striking shift in CP expression from Purkinje neurons to Bergmann glia, that suggests significant functional interdependence of copper metabolism in these cells. Inactivation of WNDP, which is associated with copper accumulation in the cytosol and disrupted copper delivery to CP in the WNDP-deficient neurons, is communicated to Bergmann glia resulting in induction of CP expression. Simultaneously, the CP-related staining disappears from Purkinje neurons either because of coordinated down-regulation of CP expression or diminished CP mRNA/protein stability in the WNDP-deficient neurons. Dissecting the mechanism of this unexpected and interesting phenomenon is an important goal of our future studies. Ceruloplasmin is an essential metabolic enzyme, which plays an important role in iron transport in the central nervous system (19Harris Z.L. Takahashi Y. Miyajima H. Serizawa M. MacGillivray R.T.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6578-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic defects in CP result in marked accumulation of iron in Purkinje neurons and neurodegeneration (30Miyajima H. Neuropathology. 2003; 23: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The co-expression of CP and MNKP in Bergmann glia in Atp7b-/- mice restores copper delivery to ceruloplasmin, compensating for the lack of WNDP and most likely restoring the CP function. The conspicuous lack of marked neurological abnormalities in the cerebellum of the Atp7b-/- mice (our data, not shown) and infrequent cerebellar manifestations in the Wilson's disease patients strongly points to the potential importance of this functional compensation.

In support of this notion, the current study demonstrates that the human cyclin D1 mRNA 5′ untranslated region contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and that both this IRES and the c-myc IRES are negatively regulated by AKT activity. Furthermore, we show that cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES function is enhanced following exposure to rapamycin and requires both p38 MAPK and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, as specific inhibitors of these pathways reduce IRES-mediated translation and protein levels under conditions of quiescent AKT activity.

Activation of mTOR results in phosphorylation of the p70 S6 kinase and the translation repressor 4E-BP1, allowing the formation of functional eIF-4F complexes resulting in cap-dependent mRNA translation initiation and ribosomal component biogenesis (4Raught B.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). The efficiency with which a mRNA can initiate cap-dependent translation is a function of the length and degree of secondary structure present within the 5′-UTR as well as the sequence context of the initiation codon (6Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic mRNAs contain 5′-UTRs with relatively short and unstructured 5′-UTRs (<100 nucleotides), which allow efficient cap-dependent ribosomal scanning (6Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 59: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, some key regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis have leaders that are quite long, highly structured, and contain many upstream AUG or CUG codons and, as a result, are inhibitory to scanning ribosomes (7Hellen C.U. Sarnow P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1593-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Translation initiation in a number of these mRNAs is achieved via IRES-mediated mechanisms (8Stoneley M. Willis A.E. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3200-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis via this alternative form of initiation is typically favored under conditions when the default cap-dependent pathway is inhibited (9Vagner S. Galy B. Pyronnet S.

The ability of AKT to regulate cap-dependent initiation is mediated via its inhibitory effects on the mTOR inhibitor complex TSC1/TSC2 (13Tee A.R. Fingar D.C. Manning B.D. Kwiatkowski D.J.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). A direct linkage between AKT and the mTOR kinase has also been described. AKT can phosphorylate mTOR, and studies in Drosophila have demonstrated that dTOR (Drosophila target of rapamycin) is downstream and epistatic to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway (5Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhang H. Stallock J.P. Ng J.C. Reinhard C. Neufeld T.P.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2689-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). However, AKT has recently been shown to negatively regulate the translation of the Elk-1 and Sap1a mRNAs independently of mTOR (18Figueroa C. Vojtek A.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5554-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and our prior work (19Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.H. Sawyers C.L. Lichtenstein A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2737-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) also suggests a role for AKT in the regulation of cap-independent translation. Previously, we identified many mRNAs the translation of which was unaffected or induced under conditions of mTOR inhibition following rapamycin treatment (19Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.H. Sawyers C.L. Lichtenstein A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2737-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Many of these transcripts remained on actively translated polysomes or shifted from monosomal to polysomal translational states following the global inhibition of cap-dependent translation. Interestingly, two of these mRNAs demonstrated remarkable differential translational states depending on the AKT activity status of the cell. In cells with relatively active AKT, the cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNAs were translationally repressed by mTOR inhibition, whereas in cells containing quiescent AKT, these transcripts were well translated and found in polysome structures following treatment with the drug. In this report we demonstrate that the human cyclin D1 mRNA can mediate internal translation initiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES function is stimulated following rapamycin exposure in cells with quiescent AKT activity but not in cells with activated AKT. Lastly, we show that differential AKT-dependent cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES activity is dependent on p38 MAPK and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling.

The cell lines were maintained in media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. We validated the expression of wild-type cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNAs in all of these cell lines by Northern analysis and sequencing of the 5′-UTRs of these transcripts, which were identical to previously published sequences (22Xiong Y.

The 5′-UTR of the human cyclin D1 mRNA (GenBank™ accession number NM053056) was amplified from total RNA. Subsequently it was inserted into the intercistronic region of pRF to generate pRCND1F. The 396-nucleotide c-myc (23Stoneley M. Paulin F.E. Le Quesne J.P. Chappell S.A. Willis A.E.

The inserts were also cloned into a promoterless version of pRF, pRF(–p) (kindly provided by J-T. Zhang, Indiana University). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Sequence Analysis and Secondary Structure Predictions—BESTFIT (GCG Wisconsin Package™, Accelrys) was used to compare the cyclin D1 leader to the 18 S rRNA sequences (GenBank™ accession number X03205).

In experiments in which rapamycin (Calbiochem) was used, cells were transfected and subsequently exposed to 10 nm rapamycin for 18 h after which extracts were prepared and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined. In Vitro Translation of Dicistronic mRNA Reporters—The dicistronic plasmids were linearized using BamHI and capped RNA transcribed in vitro (mMessage T7 transcription kit, Ambion). Capped RNA transcripts were used to program extracts of the indicated cell lines as described previously (26Carroll R. Lucas-Lenard J. Anal.

For in vitro kinase assays, MEFs treated with SB203580 (25 μm) or PD98059 (25 μm) for predetermined time points were harvested and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm NaPPi, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg of pepstatin, 2.5 μg of leupeptin, 2.5 μg of antipain, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100. Cleared supernatants were subsequently incubated with either anti-p38 or anti-ERK antibody and protein A-Sepharose overnight. Pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerolphosphate; 25 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. P38 kinase reactions were performed in the presence of 100 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 as a substrate. Phosphorylation of ATF-2 at Thr-71 was measured by Western blot using a phospho-specific ATF-2 antibody.

Similarly, the LAPC-4puro prostate cancer cell line with relatively quiescent AKT activity was stably transfected with a myristoylated AKT allele (or empty vector control). The differential AKT/mTOR cascade activation of these paired isogenic lines has already been described (19Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.H. Sawyers C.L. Lichtenstein A.K.

In addition, for this study, we also utilized MEFs in which the PTEN gene had been disrupted (21Wang S. Gao J. Lei Q. Rozengurt N. Pritchard C. Jiao J. Thomas G.V. Li G. Roy-Burman P. Nelson P.S. Liu X. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The AKT activity in these MEFs is markedly higher as compared with PTEN+/+ MEFs (21Wang S. Gao J. Lei Q. Rozengurt N. Pritchard C. Jiao J. Thomas G.V. Li G. Roy-Burman P. Nelson P.S. Liu X. Wu H.

To determine whether the human cyclin D1 leader could internally initiate translation, it was cloned into the intercistronic region of a dicistronic reporter mRNA and tested in transiently transfected cells. The c-myc leader, containing a known IRES (28Stoneley M. Chappell S.A. Jopling C.L. Dickens M. MacFarlane M. Willis A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), was also cloned into this region. The dicistronic mRNAs used in these studies contain the Renilla and firefly luciferases as the first and second cistrons, respectively (pRF). Because we had previously observed a differential pattern of cyclin D1 and c-myc polysome association in quiescent as compared with activated AKT-containing cells (19Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.H. Sawyers C.L. Lichtenstein A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2737-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), we investigated the ability of the cyclin D1 and c-myc leaders to initiate translation internally in transiently transfected cell lines containing differential AKT activities. We transiently transfected these cell lines with the indicated dicistronic constructs shown in Fig. 1A. Expression of the downstream firefly luciferase in the constructs containing the cyclin D1 5′-UTR or the c-myc IRES as compared with pRF (empty vector) was enhanced dramatically in those cell lines containing quiescent AKT activity (U87PTEN, LAPC-4puro, and PTEN+/+ MEF in Fig. 1, B, C, and D, respectively). For example, in the U87MGPTEN, LAPC-4puro, and PTEN+/+ MEF cell lines the presence of the 5′-UTR of cyclin D1 or the c-myc IRES resulted in an ∼3–4-fold increase in firefly luciferase activity. In contrast, firefly luciferase activity was minimally affected in the relatively “active AKT” member cell lines of these isogenic pairs, indicating that AKT activity prevented cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES function. Only a modest ∼1.5–2-fold increase was seen in myc-IRES activity, and there was no increase in cyclin D1 IRES activity. The presence of the human p27Kip1 IRES-containing sequences (24Kullmann M. Gopfert U. Siewe B. Hengst L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3087-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 29Miskimins W.K. Wang G. Hawkinson M. Miskimins R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4960-4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) in the dicistronic reporter construct resulted in an ∼10-fold increase in firefly luciferase activity in all of the cell lines tested irrespective of AKT activity. This was consistent with our earlier observations that the p27Kip1 mRNA was well translated in the face of mTOR inhibition regardless of the AKT status of the cell (10Qin X. Sarnow P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13721-13728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and indicates that p27Kip1 IRES function is independent of AKT activity. It also provides a control confirming that reporter expression will occur in the “high-AKT” cell lines if an IRES is functional. To evaluate whether the AKT-dependent enhanced translation of the downstream cistron in the cell lines tested was the result of initiation from shorter monocistronic transcripts or possibly from cryptic promoter activity, we analyzed the dicistronic mRNAs via Northern blot and luciferase activities in constructs where the SV40 promoter was absent (pRF(–p), pRCD1F(–p), and pRmycF(–p)) (30Han B. Zhang J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7372-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows a schematic diagram of the promoterless dicistronic constructs transfected into PTEN–/– and PTEN+/+ MEFs. As shown in Fig. 2B, introduction of the promoterless constructs resulted in minimal luciferase activities in both the PTEN–/– and PTEN+/+ MEFs, indicating that the AKT-dependent firefly luciferase expression from these constructs was not the result of internal promoter activities. Furthermore, Northern analysis of mRNAs from transfected PTEN–/– or PTEN+/+ MEFs detected only the presence of the full-length dicistronic transcripts when probed for sequences within the downstream firefly luciferase open reading frame (Fig. 2C). The 5′-UTR of cyclin D1 is 208 nucleotides in length, whereas the c-myc IRES sequences are 396 nucleotides in length. These data further supported the notion that the cyclin D1 5′-UTR was capable of internal initiation and that both the IRES activities of the 5′-UTR of cyclin and the c-myc IRES were regulated by AKT activity. The Cyclin D1 5′-UTR and c-myc IRES Mediate Internal Initiation in an AKT-dependent Fashion in Cell-free Extracts—To rule out that firefly luciferase reporter expression could be due to unusual cryptic splicing events, we analyzed the AKT-dependent IRES activities of the cyclin D1 and c-myc mRNAs in cell-free extracts. These extracts were prepared according to Carroll and Lucas-Lenard (26Carroll R. Lucas-Lenard J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and demonstrated to have high efficiencies in initiating protein synthesis. Capped dicistronic mRNAs that either lacked (pRF) or contained the cyclin D1 (pRCND1F) 5′-UTR, the c-myc IRES (pRmycF), or the p27Kip1 IRES (pRp27F) were in vitro transcribed and subsequently used to program translation in lysates from U87MG, U87MGPTEN, LAPC-4puro, LAPC-4myrAKT, PTEN+/+ MEFs, or PTEN–/– MEFs. Translation of the parent pRF mRNA yielded firefly luciferase activities, which were indistinguishable from the background obtained from control reaction mixtures that lacked the firefly luciferase reporter mRNAs. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 3, an equivalent amount of either pRCND1F or pRmycF mRNAs generated firefly luciferase activities, which were ∼2–4-fold higher in extracts prepared from cell lines with relatively quiescent AKT levels. The firefly luciferase activities generated from the pRp27F mRNA were consistently ∼6-fold higher in all cell extracts tested as compared with pRF mRNA. This again was consistent with the results from the dicistronic in vivo experiments, demonstrating that the IRES-dependent translation of p27Kip1 was independent of AKT activity. To evaluate whether the translation of the cyclin 5′-UTR and the c-myc IRES in these reporter mRNAs was indeed cap-independent within these cell extracts, in vitro transcribed and capped mRNAs from pRCND1F and pRmycF were translated in the presence of increasing concentrations of the cap analog m7GTP. This analog blocks cap-dependent translation by binding to the initiation factor eIF-4E (31Cai A. Jankowska-Anyszka M. Centers A. Chlebicka L. Stepinski J. Stolarski R. Darzynkiewicz E. Rhoads R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8538-85477Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Using mRNA in vitro transcribed from pRF and capped, translation of the Renilla luciferase cistron was blocked by ∼90–95% at 150 μm of m7GpppG but was not affected by comparable concentrations of the non-methylated form of the analog GTP, and the translation of the firefly cistron was unaffected by m7GpppG (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, with both the in vitro transcribed and capped mRNAs from pRCND1F and pRmycF, the translation of the Renilla cistron was inhibited by ∼80–90% at concentrations of 100 μm m7GpppG or higher in all cell extracts tested. However, the translation of the firefly cistron remained consistent in the extracts with relatively high levels of active AKT and increased ∼1.5–2.5-fold in extracts from the cell lines with relatively quiescent AKT levels. This again supported the notion that sequences present within the 5′-UTR of cyclin D1 mRNA could confer cap-independent initiation and that both this sequence and the c-myc IRES activities were enhanced under conditions of low AKT activity. AKT-dependent Cyclin D1 5′-UTR and c-myc IRES Activity Is Enhanced by Rapamycin—Because our previous studies (19Gera J.F. Mellinghoff I.K. Shi Y. Rettig M.B. Tran C. Hsu J.H. Sawyers C.L. Lichtenstein A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2737-2746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) demonstrated a stimulation of cyclin D1 and c-myc polysome association and protein levels by rapamycin under conditions of quiescent AKT activity, we assessed whether cyclin D1 or c-myc IRES activity would also be enhanced following rapamycin exposure in cells with quiescent AKT activity. To address the AKT-dependent affects of rapamycin on cyclin D1 or c-myc IRES function, we transfected our dicistronic constructs into the cell lines shown in Fig. 5 and determined Renilla and firefly luciferase activities prior to and following rapamycin exposure. Renilla luciferase activity was reduced by rapamycin ∼70–90% as compared with values obtained in the absence of the drug for each construct tested (data not shown). However, the results show that in the cell lines with relatively quiescent AKT (U87PTEN, LAPC-4puro, and PTEN+/+ MEFs), rapamycin treatment resulted in an ∼3–6-fold stimulation of firefly luciferase activity as compared with values obtained for lines containing active AKT. Interestingly, rapamycin exposure also stimulated p27Kip1 IRES activity ∼4–6-fold in all cell lines irrespective of AKT activity, again consistent with our previous data and results from others demonstrating the resistance of p27 IRESKip1 activity following exposure to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (24Kullmann M. Gopfert U. Siewe B. Hengst L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 3087-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis further demonstrated that rapamycin had no effect on pRF steady-state mRNA levels prior to and following rapamycin treatment (data not shown). Differential AKT-dependent Cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES Activity Is Dependent on Both p38 Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase and RAF/MEK/ERK Signaling—Because it has been demonstrated previously that c-myc IRES function is dependent on p38 MAPK activity during apoptosis (28Stoneley M. Chappell S.A. Jopling C.L. Dickens M. MacFarlane M. Willis A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1162-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and both p38 MAPK and ERK signaling following genotoxic stress (32Subkhankulova T. Mitchell S.A. Willis A.E. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we investigated whether these cascades also contributed to the differential AKT-dependent cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES activity we had observed. An additional rationale was the known ability of AKT to down-regulate p38 (33Gratton J.P. Morales-Ruiz M. Kureishi Y. Fulton D. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30359-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and ERK (34Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar) activity. To determine whether differential p38 or ERK signaling could be correlated with AKT-dependent cyclin D1 or c-myc IRES activity, we initially examined the activities of these kinases in the PTEN–/– and PTEN+/+ MEFs prior to and following rapamycin exposure. As shown in Fig. 6A, the basal p38 and ERK kinase activities as determined by in vitro kinase assays was ∼3–4-fold higher in the PTEN+/+ MEFs as compared with the PTEN–/– MEFs. Additionally, treatment with rapamycin resulted in an 8-fold induction of p38 and 10-fold induction of ERK activity in PTEN+/+ MEFs while only modestly increasing basal p38 and ERK activities (∼1–2-fold) in the PTEN–/– MEFs. Total p38 and ERK content in the samples was similar, demonstrating that equivalent amounts of material were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 6A). These data suggest that p38 and ERK signaling is activated by rapamycin exposure in an AKT-dependent manner and is consistent with the known negative regulatory effects of AKT on p38 and on ERK (33Gratton J.P. Morales-Ruiz M. Kureishi Y. Fulton D. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30359-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 34Zimmermann S. Moelling K. Science. 1999; 286: 1741-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). To investigate whether AKT-dependent cyclin D1 and c-myc IRES activity was regulated by p38 or ERK signaling we planned to transfect PTEN+/+ and PTEN–/– MEFs with the indicated dicistronic constructs in Fig. 6B and subsequently to treat these cells with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK inhibitor PD98058. Our preliminary experiments demonstrated almost complete inhibition of kinase activity using these inhibitors (data not shown). Treatment of either PTEN+/+ or PTEN–/– MEFs with SB203580 inhibited"

Sci. 1999; 24: 411-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Most RGS proteins contain additional noncatalytic domains that modulate the properties of their catalytic domains and allow them to interact with their partners in a broad range of signaling pathways. The R7 (also called “C”) subfamily of RGS proteins contains four members expressed in the mammalian nervous system, RGS6, RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11 (reviewed in Ref. 4Jones M.B. Siderovski D.P. Hooks S.B. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). R7 proteins share common domain composition and exist as constitutive complexes with the type 5 G protein β subunit (Gβ5). Marked progress in the understanding of the function of the R7 protein came from the studies of the short splice variant of RGS9, RGS9-1, which regulates signal duration in the phototransduction pathway in vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptors. Several functional properties of RGS9-1 in photoreceptors are regulated by its interacting partner, a SNARE-like protein R9AP. R9AP is responsible for targeting RGS9-1 to the photoreceptor outer segment, an intracellular compartment where phototransduction takes place (5Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Hopp J.A. Kolesnikov A.V. Chen C.K. Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also determines the RGS9-1 expression level by protecting RGS9-1 from proteolytic degradation in the cell (6Keresztes G. Martemyanov K.A. Krispel C.M. Mutai H. Yoo P.J. Maison S.F. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. Heller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1581-1584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, R9AP enhances the ability of RGS9-1 to stimulate G protein GTPase activity thus allowing the visual signal to be terminated on the physiologically rapid time scale (5Martemyanov K.A.

The physiological significance of RGS9-1 interaction with R9AP was emphasized in a recent human study of patients bearing defects in either RGS9 or R9AP molecules (9Nishiguchi K.M. Sandberg M.A. Kooijman A.C. Martemyanov K.A. Pott J.W. Hagstrom S.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nature. 2004; 427: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mutations of either protein resulted in a clinical phenotype characterized by impaired ability to adjust to bright light and by impaired temporal resolution of the visual signals resulting in reduced ability to see moving objects. The importance of RGS9-1 interaction with R9AP in the visual system suggests that similar interactions may regulate the function of other R7 proteins, each containing the N-terminal DEP domain. In mammals, all R7 proteins, including RGS6, RGS7, RGS11, and the long splice variant of RGS9, RGS9-2, are expressed in the brain (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas R9AP expression is restricted to the retina (12Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study we searched for unknown R9AP homolog(s) that could interact with R7 proteins in the brain. We have found that indeed all four R7 proteins interact with a novel neuronal homolog of R9AP, which we call R7-binding protein (R7BP). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The coding region of R7BP was amplified by PCR from Marathon-ready mouse brain cDNA library (BD Biosciences) using the NdeI-containing upstream primer: 5′-GGAATTCCATATGAGTTCTGCACCGAATGGGC-3′ and the EcoRI-containing downstream primer: 5′-TGGCGAATTCCTAGCTTGAGACAAGACAACATAAGC-3′. The PCR product was cloned into the pGEX2T Escherichia coli expression vector downstream from the GST coding sequence at BamHI and EcoRI sites via a BamHI-NdeI linker. The R7BP coding region was sequenced and found to be identical to the sequence found in GenBank™ (accession no. AK046733). The resulting vector was transformed into the BL21(DE3) E. coli strain, and the cells were induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside at OD800 = 0.8. Three hours post-induction cells were collected and disrupted by sonication. R7BP found in the particulate fraction was solubilization by 6 m urea and dialyzed into the Buffer A: 12 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 3.7 KCl, 447 mm NaCl, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Renatured protein was purified on the Hi-Trap glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. The construction of the pVL1392 plasmids encoding RGS9-1, the RGS9ΔDEP mutant of RGS9-1 (amino acids 112–484), and the short splice variant of Gβ5 was described previously (13Skiba N.P.

RGS7 cDNA cloned in pVL1392 was a gift from William Simonds (NIDDK, National Institutes of Health). The cDNAs coding for mouse RGS6 and RGS11 were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from total RNA isolated from the mouse brain. The RGS6 specific primers used were: BamHI-containing upstream 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCTCAGGGGTCCGGGGAC-3′ and MfeI-containing downstream 5′-GCGCAATTGTCAGGAGGACTGCATCAGGCCC-3′. The RGS11 specific primers used were: BamHI-containing upstream 5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCCATGGTTACCCGCTGC and MfeI-containing downstream 5′-GCGCAATTGCTACTCCCCATCGGCACCTTC-3′. PCR products were digested with BamHI and MfeI restriction endonucleases and cloned into the modified baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 treated with BamHI and EcoRI enzymes (13Skiba N.P.

The resulting constructs encoded RGS6 and RGS11 preceded by an amino acid sequence containing a His6 tag and a thrombin cleavage site. The coding regions for RGS proteins were sequenced and found to match those published in GenBank™ (NM_015812 for RGS6 and XM_128488 for RGS11) The R7 and Gβ5 constructs were used to generate recombinant baculoviruses through the custom service of Orbigen (San Diego, CA).

Specific antisera against the following peptides corresponding to the mouse proteins were obtained from both sheep and rabbit by Elmira Biologicals (Iowa City, IA): the N-terminal R7BP peptide CSAPNGRKKRPSRSTRSSI; the C-terminal RGS6 peptide CKKGKSLAGKRLTGLMQSS, the C-terminal RGS7 peptide CRKGKTLTSKSLTSLVQSY, the C-terminal RGS9-2 peptide DSDDPRAGESGDQTTEKEVICPWESLAEGKAG, and the C-terminal RGS11 peptide CSPALQSTPREPAATSSPEGADGE. Each peptide was purified by high performance liquid chromatography and coupled to the maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce); the resulting conjugates were used to immunize sheep and rabbits. Specific antibodies were purified from the immune sera by affinity chromatography on the columns with immobilized peptides used for the immunization. Preparation of the Brain Extracts—All procedures were performed at 4 °C unless stated otherwise. Whole brains were removed from mice and dissected on ice. For the analysis of the R7BP expression, various brain structures were removed, placed in 1.5 ml of Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 (Buffer B), and homogenized by sonication. Detergentinsoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting detergent extracts were subsequently used for immunoprecipitation by anti-R7BP and RGS9-2 antibodies. For the preparative immunoprecipitation of RGS9-2, striatums from six mice were placed in 3 ml of Buffer A. The tissue was homogenized by passing it through a series of needles (18–23 gauge), and the resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to sediment the membrane fraction. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer B and incubated for 1 h on a rocking platform to extract membrane proteins. The non-soluble debris was removed from the detergent-solubilized extract by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. Immunoprecipitation—For protein immunoprecipitation, 1.5 ml of the striatal extract or extracts obtained from other brain regions was incubated on a rocking platform for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to either anti-RGS9-2 or IgG antibodies (300 μg each). The antibodies were covalently crosslinked to the protein G with BS3 (Pierce) following the manufacturer's protocol. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of Buffer B. For preparative experiments, proteins were eluted with 100 μlof5% ammonium hydroxide, lyophilized, solubilized in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized with Novex Coomassie-based stain (Invitrogen). For analytical experiments, proteins were eluted by 50 μl of the SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. Pull-down Assays—Pull-down assays were conducted essentially as described previously (14Martemyanov K.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 16Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. Neuron. 2003; 38: 857-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 nmol of a GST-tagged protein was coupled to 15 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the binding buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.25% lauryl sucrose, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The beads were incubated with 50 μl of 0.1 μm R7·Gβ5 complexes for 20 min on ice and then washed three times with 1 ml of the binding buffer. RGS proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. 10-μl aliquots of the eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by the Western blot detection using specific antibodies against each RGS protein. Mass Spectrometry—Coomassie-stained protein bands were excised from the gel and treated with trypsin using the in-gel digestion kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Dried peptides were dissolved in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and 5 mg/ml α4-hydroxycinnamic acid as a matrix. 0.6 μl of peptide-matrix mix was loaded onto a 192-spot MALDI plate dried at room temperature and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS and MS/MS analyses using the 4700 Proteomics analyzer and GPS software package (Applied Biosystems). A combination of peptide mass fingerprinting and the MS/MS analysis was performed using the Mascot search engine. Fragmentation of the precursors was carried out using the collision-induced dissociation settings. Collision-induced dissociation spectra were submitted for protein identifications with a precursor precision tolerance of 1 Da and MS/MS fragment tolerance of 0.5 Da. R7BP Is a Novel Protein Interacting with RGS9-2 in the Brain—We searched for proteins interacting with RGS9-2 in the mouse striatum by conducting co-immunoprecipitation studies using affinity purified sheep IgG recognizing the C terminus of RGS9-2. A typical experiment, illustrated in Fig. 1A, revealed the presence of several protein bands including RGS9-2 and its constitutive Gβ5 subunit. To assess which of the bands present in this gel may be proteins interacting with RGS9-2 specifically we performed a control immunoprecipitation experiment using the total sheep IgG fraction. Only one protein, other than RGS9-2 and Gβ5, was precipitated by specific antibodies and absent in the control IgG precipitate. The corresponding band of ∼30 kDa was excised from the gel, subjected to tryptic digestion, and analyzed by MALDI MS and MS/MS mass spectrometry. Using a combination of peptide mass fingerprinting and MS/MS sequencing, we have identified six peptides corresponding to the sequence of an unnamed protein product with a molecular mass of 29,575 Da (NCBI accession number BAC32849.1; Fig. 1B). Three of these peptides (SICLLGSLQFHR, ELVISIGDVSVSCPSLR, LAAISGPEDGEIHPEICR) were sequenced by MS/MS with high ion scores that yielded confidence intervals of >99.9% for each peptide, indicating correct identification of the protein. R7BP is also encoded in human, rat, and Xenopus genomes (NCBI accession numbers XP_376386.1, XP_215473.2, and AAH73094.1, respectively). Based on its ability to interact with all R7 proteins (see below), we named this protein R7-binding protein or R7BP. Remarkably, its closest homolog is R9AP, which interacts with RGS9-1 in photoreceptors (Fig. 1B). As in R9AP, the predicted secondary structure of the major N-terminal part of the R7BP molecule contains four α-helices likely to form coiled coils (12Hu G. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9755-9760Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Keresztes G. Mutai H. Hibino H. Hudspeth A.J. Heller S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It also resembles the structure of syntaxin, a SNARE protein participating in membrane fusion (5Martemyanov K.A. Lishko P.V. Calero N. Keresztes G. Sokolov M. Strissel K.J. Leskov I.B. Hopp J.A. Kolesnikov A.V. Chen C.K. Lem J. Heller S. Burns M.E. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10175-10181Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Keresztes G. Mutai H. Hibino H. Hudspeth A.J. Heller S. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, unlike R9AP and syntaxin, R7BP lacks a C-terminal transmembrane domain. Instead, its C terminus contains a polybasic region followed by two cysteines. This resembles the sequence of the C terminus of Ras where both the polybasic region and lipid modifications of the cysteines were shown to mediate Ras membrane attachment (18Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. MacDonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 19Resh M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1451: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Based on this analogy, R7BP may also be a membrane-associated protein, which is consistent with its presence in brain membrane fractions. To obtain further evidence that RGS9-2 forms a complex with R7BP in striatum we conducted reciprocal co-precipitation experiments using the sheep anti-R7BP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1C, RGS9-2 was efficiently precipitated by anti-R7BP antibodies but not by the control, non-immune IgG. R7BP Is Specifically Expressed in the Nervous System—Fig. 1D illustrates our analysis of the R7BP tissue expression profile. Because of a relatively low abundance of R7BP, we first precipitated R7BP from each tissue extract using the sheep anti R7BP antibody. We then detected the presence of R7BP in each precipitate by Western blotting using the rabbit anti R7BP antibody. These experiments demonstrated that R7BP is ubiquitously expressed throughout the nervous system including the retina but is not detectible in any of the non-neuronal tissues that we tested. The Binding of RGS9 to R7BP Is Mediated by the DEP Domain—Since the binding of RGS9 to R9AP occurs via the N-terminal domain of RGS9 called DEP, we tested whether the same domain is responsible for RGS9 binding to R7BP. Our experimental approach replicated that used to establish the DEP domain as the R9AP interacting site (7Lishko P.V. Martemyanov K.A. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24376-24381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 8Hu G. Zhang Z. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14550-14554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We used pull-down assays to monitor the binding of the GST-tagged R7BP to a set of RGS9 constructs. As shown in the two upper panels of Fig. 2, both splice isoforms of RGS9, RGS9-1 and RGS9-2, interact with R7BP with similar efficiency. However, the construct lacking the DEP domain, RGS9ΔDEP, does not bind to R7BP at all. These data demonstrate that the DEP domain of RGS9 is required for the R7BP binding, whereas the unique C-terminal sequences of each splice isoform are not required for this interaction. Therefore, the DEP domain is responsible for the RGS9 interaction with both R9AP and R7BP. R7BP Interacts with All Four R7 Proteins—While R7BP is expressed throughout the entire central nervous system (Fig. 1C), the expression of RGS9-2 is restricted to striatum and just a few other brain regions (20Rahman Z. Gold S.J. Potenza M.N. Cowan C.W. Ni Y.G. He W. Wensel T.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2016-2026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Zachariou V. Georgescu D. Sanchez N. Rahman Z. DiLeone R. Berton O. Neve R.L. Sim-Selley L.J. Selley D.E. Gold S.J. Nestler E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Bouhamdan M. Michelhaugh S.K. Calin-Jageman I. Ahern-Djamali S. Bannon M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1691: 141-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This suggests that R7BP may be associated with other members of the R7 RGS family expressed in multiple brain regions (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Gold S.J. Ni Y.G. Dohlman H.G. Nestler E.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8024-8037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by immunoprecipitating R7BP from the mouse brain extract and probing the precipitate for the presence of RGS6, RGS7, and RGS11. The Western blot analysis illustrated in Fig. 3A revealed that all four members of the R7 family were present in the precipitate. No such precipitation was observed when specific anti-R7BP antibodies were substituted with non-immune IgG. We next studied the interactions between R7BP and R7 proteins using recombinant proteins in vitro. Each mouse R7 protein was co-expressed with Gβ5 in the Sf-9/baculovirus system and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each of these R7·Gβ5 complexes was functionally active, as evident by its ability to stimulate the GTPase activities of transducin and Gαo (data not shown). Pull-down assays shown in Fig. 3B demonstrated that each R7·Gβ5 complex was efficiently retained by R7BP attached to the Sepharose beads via an N-terminal GST tag (Fig. 3B). Control experiments demonstrated that no binding was observed with beads containing the GST tag alone, indicating that the interaction between R7BP and R7 proteins is specific. Finally, we analyzed the binding of R7 proteins to R9AP and snapin, a protein previously reported as a binding partner of the DEP domain of RGS7 (23Hunt R.A. Edris W. Chanda P.K. Nieuwenhuijsen B. Young K.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The data shown in Fig. 3B indicate that R9AP interacts with RGS9 and its closest homolog RGS11 but not with RGS6 and RGS7. This indicates that R7BP has a broader range (and perhaps functional role) of interaction with R7 proteins than R9AP. We did not observe the binding of the N-terminally GST-tagged snapin to any of these R7 proteins. At present, we cannot explain this discrepancy with the previous report; it may reflect low binding affinity or unidentified differences in experimental conditions. Concluding Remarks—RGS proteins of the R7 subfamily have been recently shown to play an important role in the normal functioning and survival of mammals. The functional knock-out of all four R7 proteins, which takes place in the Gβ5 knock-out mice, leads to multiple health problems, low body weight, and a high mortality rate (24Chen C.K. Eversole-Cire P. Zhang H.K. Mancino V. Chen Y.J. He W. Wensel T.G. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6604-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A less severe but also well identifiable phenotype was documented in the RGS9 knock-out mice. In addition to their visual impairment (25Chen C.K. Burns M.E. He W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), these mice display behavioral abnormalities due to impaired regulation of opioid and dopamine signaling pathways (21Zachariou V. Georgescu D. Sanchez N. Rahman Z. DiLeone R. Berton O. Neve R.L. Sim-Selley L.J. Selley D.E. Gold S.J. Nestler E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A milestone in understanding the biology of R7 proteins was the discovery that they all exist as constitutive complexes with Gβ5 (15Makino E.R. Handy J.W. Li T.S. Arshavsky V.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1947-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 27Cabrera J.L. De Freitas F. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Gβ5 determines the folding and stability of R7 proteins and regulates their catalytic activity (reviewed in Ref. 4Jones M.B. Siderovski D.P. Hooks S.B. Mol. Interv. 2004; 4: 200-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified another universal partner of all R7 proteins, a novel neuronal protein R7BP. R7BP has a high degree of homology to R9AP from photoreceptors, both being related to the syntaxin subfamily of SNARE proteins. The importance of the R9AP interaction with RGS9-1 for normal vision suggests that the interactions of R7 proteins with R7BP in the brain also bear major functional significance. Our understanding of the R9AP function in photoreceptors provides a strong conceptual framework for studying the function(s) of R7BP in the brain. Future experiments would explore the role of R7BP in maintaining R7 protein stability and expression levels, determining R7 protein intracellular targeting, and regulating R7 protein activity."

Evidence is presented demonstrating that only Pkc1 and the upstream elements of the cell integrity pathway are essential for cell survival upon treatment with two oxidizing agents, diamide and hydrogen peroxide. Mtl1 is characterized for the first time as a cell-wall sensor of oxidative stress. We also show that the actin cytoskeleton is a cellular target for oxidative stress. Both diamide and hydrogen peroxide provoke a marked depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton, being Mtl1, Rom2 and Pkc1 functions all required to restore the correct actin organization. Diamide induces the formation of disulfide bonds in newly secreted cell-wall proteins. This mainly provokes structural changes in the cell outer layer, which activate the PKC1-MAPK pathway and hence the protein kinase Slt2. Our results led us to the conclusion that Pkc1 activity is required to overcome the effects of oxidative stress by: (i) enhancing the machinery required to repair the altered cell wall and (ii) restoring actin cytoskeleton polarity by promoting actin cable formation.

Cells are constantly exposed to a series of environmental stresses, which are sensed by complex signal transduction pathways that are responsible for cellular damage repair and adaptation responses. These responses are mediated by (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); DTT, dithiothreitol.1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKC, protein kinase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); DTT, dithiothreitol. cascades in eukaryotic cells. In the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the PKC1-MAPK cell integrity pathway is involved in responses to a wide variety of stresses, including heat-shock (1Kamada Y. Jung U.S. Piotrowski J. Levin D.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), hypoosmotic shock (2Davenport K.R. Sohaskey M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Gustin M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30157-30161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), nutritional stress (3Torres J. Di Como C.J. Herrero E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43495-43504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and those associated with any other injuries that alter the integrity of the outer layer of cells. These environmental signals are generally sensed by Mid2 (4Rajavel M. Philip B. Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and Wsc family (5Verna J. Lodder A. Lee K. Vagts A. Ballester R. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13804-13809Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) cell surface proteins. Mtl1 is a putative cell membrane sensor with 50% homology to Mid2 (6Ketela T. Green R. Bussey H. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3330-3340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rajavel M. Philip B. Buehrer B.M. Errede B. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mtl1 has been characterized as a multicopy suppressor of the absence of Rgd1, a protein that functions as a GTPase-activating protein for Rho3 and Rho4 proteins (7De Bettignies G. Thoraval D. Morel C. Peypouquet M.F. Crouzet M. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and as a multicopy suppressor of Rho1 functions (8Sekiya-Kawasaki M. Abe M. Saka A. Watanabe D. Kono K. Minemura-Asakawa M. Ishihara S. Watanabe T. Ohya Y. Genetics. 2002; 162: 663-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell surface sensors transmit signals to Rom2, a guanine exchange factor protein of the GTP-binding protein Rho1. Rho1 then activates the Pkc1 protein kinase, which in turn activates an MAPK module; Pkc1 phosphorylates Bck1, a MAPK kinase kinase, which transmits the signal to both MAPK kinases, Mkk1 and Mkk2. Those finally activate the last member of the cascade, Slt2/Mpk1, by phosphorylating both the Thr190 and Tyr192 residues of this MAPK (the PKC1-MAPK pathway reviewed in Refs 9Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar and 10Hohmann S. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 300-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Rlm1, a transcription factor involved in the activation of cell wall genes, and Swi6 (a transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation) are both targets for Slt2. Activation of Slt2 correlates to activation of both downstream events (11Martin-Yken H. Dagkessamanskaia A. Basmaji F. Lagorce A. Francois J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The upper elements of the PKC1-MAPK pathway are involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton upon cell wall stress. It has been reported that hyperactivation of either Pkc1 or Rho1 alone causes depolarization of actin cables in patches dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (12Delley P.A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, the function of both Rho1 and Pkc1 is necessary for actin to become depolarized following heat stress (12Delley P.A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Actin cable assembly relies on the activity of the two redundant formins, Bni1 and Bnr1 (13Evangelista M. Pruyine D. Amberg D.C. Boone C. Bretscher A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14Sagot I. Klee S.K. Pelman D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Rho1 is able to localize to actin patches (15Drgonova J. Drgon T. Tanaka K. Kollar R. Chen G.C. Ford R.A. Chan C.S. Takai Y. Cabib E. Science. 1996; 272: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and is required for the activation of formins at high temperatures through Pkc1 (16Dong Y. Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This emphasizes the role of these proteins in polarized growth and morphogenesis. Oxygen is a vital molecule, but at the same time, it is responsible for provoking oxidative stress in cells, and causing cellular damage to various macromolecules (17Ames B. Shigenaga M. Hagen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5354) Google Scholar). Budding yeast constitutes an optimal eukaryotic model for studying oxidative stress responses (18Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Biteau B. Spector D. Azevedo D. Hohmann S. Hager P.W.H. Topics in Current Genetics. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg2003: 242-303Google Scholar). However, although in the case of environmental stresses, such as osmotic, nutritional, and heat-shock stresses, there are specific signal transduction pathways that sense and transmit the different signals to specific components in S. cerevisiae (19Banuett F. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 249-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there are no well characterized MAPK pathways for sensing and signaling oxidative stresses to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Nevertheless, there is considerable information in the literature detailing the nuclear transcriptional factors responsible for the induction of specific genes in response to oxidative stress in yeast. These are Yap1, Skn7, and Msn2/4 (for a review, see Ref. 18Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Biteau B. Spector D. Azevedo D. Hohmann S. Hager P.W.H. Topics in Current Genetics. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Heidelberg2003: 242-303Google Scholar). In this study, we decided to investigate whether the cell integrity pathway in S. cerevisiae played a role in oxidative stress responses based on the following observations: (i) Skn7 has been shown to interact with the GTPase Rho1 (20Alberts A.S. Bouquin N. Johnston L.H. Treisman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8616-8622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar); (ii) it has been reported that Msn2/Msn4 participate with the PKC1-MAPK pathway in the compensatory mechanism that is triggered by cell wall mutations (21Lagorce A. Hauser N.C. Labourdette D. Rodriguez C. Martin-Yken H. Arroyo J. Hoheisel J.D. François J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20345-20357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar); (iii) genome-wide analysis (22Gash A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3680) Google Scholar) indicates that the agent diamide induces the activation of genes regulated by Rlm1; and (iv) in human cells, isoforms of PKC are known to be either activated or inactivated by oxidative stress, and this is causally associated with tumorigenesis (for a review see Ref. 23Gopalakrishna R. Jake S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Pkc1, and the upper elements of the cell integrity pathway, are required for survival and adaptation to the oxidative stress provoked by two different oxidizing agents: hydrogen peroxide and diamide. We also report a new function for Mtl1 as a cell membrane receptor for oxidative stress. We present a detailed study demonstrating that the major effect caused by diamide is the oxidation of cell wall proteins, which activates the cell integrity pathway. Hydrogen peroxide exercises its action at the intracellular level, mainly by affecting a cellular function that is closely related to the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, we demonstrate that restoration of cell polarity and recovery from oxidative stress occurs in a Pkc1-dependent manner.

Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) was cloned at the SmaI site of the pFA6a plasmid containing the kanMX4 cassette. The resulting plasmid, pCYC86, was provided by Dr. Marti Aldea's laboratory. We then used PCR to amplify the sGFP-kanMX4 module from pCYC86. We did this by using oligonucleotides designed to insert the product in-frame, just before the stop codon of the genomic PKC1 sequence to obtain the fusion protein Pkc1-GFP. These were: MMO218, 5′-gcaagaagagtttagaggatttt-CCTTTATGCCAGATGATTTGGATTTACCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC; MMO219, 5′-CCGCTTAGATGTTTTATATAAAATTAAATAAATCATGGCATGACCTTTTCTgcataggccactagtggatc, where the use of lowercase letters represents the sequence used to amplify the kanMX4 cassette, and the use of capital letters represents the sequence homologous to the C-terminal domain of PKC1 designed for recombinational integration. Plasmids—Plasmid pMM126 contains PKC1 under the tetO7 promoter and is tagged with the HA epitope, as described before (27de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Torres J. Ariño J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33468-33476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To detect the total amount of Slt2 protein in protein extracts, we used yeast strains transformed with a YEP352 plasmid derivative containing the Slt2 open reading frame under its own promoter and tagged with the HA epitope in C-terminal (a gift from Dr. Maria Molina). All the strains used in this report were transformed with this plasmid, and the total amount of Slt2 was determined by using the anti-hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody (right panel), which was established as a loading control throughout this study. Media and Growth Conditions—Yeasts were grown in SC (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and auxotrophic requirements) or SD (SC plus drop-out mixture) media (28Kaiser C. Michaelis S. Mitchel A. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar) plus the required amino acids. Where needed, sorbitol was added to a final concentration of 0.8 m final concentration. Diamide (Sigma) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide, whereas hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) was diluted with sterile Milli Q water. Yeast Extracts and Immunoblot Analyses and Conditions for the Use of the Anti-phospho-p44/42 and Anti-Swi6—These analyses were performed as described previously (27de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. Torres J. Ariño J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33468-33476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The anti-HA antibody was used at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.125 m NaCl, 0.1% tween 20) in the presence of 0.25% milk fat, and the corresponding horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse secondary antibody, at a dilution of 1:10.000 in TBST containing 0.25% milk fat. Sulfhydryl Determination with DTNB (Ellman's Reagent)—Yeast cells were grown in SC medium at 25 °C (to an initial A600 = 0.6). The assay was essentially conducted as described before (29de Nobel J.G. Klis F.M. Munnik T. Priem J. van den Ende H. Yeast. 1990; 6: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 30 ml of culture were used for each treatment. They were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspended in 2 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4), and then treated and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min as follows: (i) control without treatment; (ii) 20 mm dithiothreitol (DTT); (iii) 1 mm H2O2; (iv) 2 mm H2O2; and (v) 4 mm diamide. After that, samples were washed three times with the same buffer. Next, they were resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent), and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Finally, samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 3 min, and the supernatants were used to measure the optical density at 412 nm. The amount of free SH residues was quantified at this wavelength. The reducing agent DTT was used as a control to quantify the maximum amount of free SH residues on cell surfaces. Osmotic stabilization was achieved in pkc1 and wild type cell cultures by adding sorbitol to a final concentration of 0.8 m. Zymolyase Digestions—Cells were exponentially grown in SC medium at 25 °C and subsequently treated with 4 mm diamide and 1 mm hydrogen peroxide for 30 and 60 min, respectively. Mock treated cells were used as controls. After the treatments, 10 ml of each cell culture were centrifuged at 2,500 rpm for 5 min. The resulting pellets were washed first with 10 ml of sterile Milli Q water and then with 5 ml of Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 9.4). The final pellet was resuspended in the last buffer. Samples of 1 ml of volume of each culture were added to 0.2 or 0.5 units zymolyase. Cell lysis was spectrophotometrically quantified at 600 nm. Actin Staining—Cells growing exponentially at 25 °C were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin as described before (3Torres J. Di Como C.J. Herrero E. de la Torre-Ruiz M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43495-43504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Log phase cells were treated, or mock treated, with 1 mm diamide for 9 h, then fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 1 h in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. Samples were then washed three times in the same buffer followed by a second fixation in osmium tetraoxide 1% in H2O for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing, the pellets were processed by dehydration using a series of acetones from 30–100% followed by propylene oxide treatment. Samples were then incubated in a resin (Durcupan ACM Epoxy Resin, Fluka): propylene oxide 3:1 for 45 min, 1:1 for 45 min, and 1:3 for 45 min, before embedding in resin and curing. Sections were cut and treated with lead citrate before viewing under a Zeiss 910 transmission electron microscope. Oxidative Stress Provoked by Diamide and Hydrogen Peroxide Activates the Cell Integrity Pathway—Given the role that the cell integrity pathway plays in the response to a wide variety of stresses, we decided to investigate whether this pathway was also involved in the oxidative stress response. Exponentially growing cells were treated either with diamide or hydrogen peroxide for the indicated times (Fig. 2A). Samples were taken for Western blot to detect activated Slt2, using the anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody raised against dually phosphorylated Thr202/Tyr204-p44/42 MAPK. It is generally accepted that detection of the doubly phosphorylated form of Slt2 provides a measure of kinase activation. The concentrations of the two oxidizing agents chosen for this study were sublethal and did not cause cell death during the course of the experiment. We had previously tested the following concentrations for the two agents: 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, and 5 mm in the case of hydrogen peroxide, and 1, 2, and 4 mm for diamide (not shown). During the first 3 h of treatment, we observed that concentrations of hydrogen peroxide of <1 mm failed to provoke a higher induction in Slt2 activity, whereas concentrations of >2 mm caused no detectable activation whatsoever. Increasing the concentrations of diamide had a different effect in Slt2 activity. Greater concentrations of diamide provoked higher inductions of Slt2 double phosphorylation, although these were concomitant with an increase in cell lethality (results not shown in this study). Diamide and peroxide treatments both significantly induced Slt2 dual phosphorylation, although the kinetics of activation differed, with activation occurring considerably sooner with diamide (Fig. 2A). The addition of the osmotic stabilizer sorbitol almost totally abolished Slt2-dependent diamide activation, suggesting that diamide might affect the cell wall. In contrast, sorbitol did not significantly affect Slt2 induction of activity provoked by peroxide. This seems to indicate that the mechanism that regulates the induction of the PKC1-MAPK pathway mediated by peroxide takes place inside the cells. Interestingly, when we used other peroxides such as t-butyl hydroperoxide we obtained similar results to those observed with H2O2 (not shown). Activation of the PKC1-MAPK pathway and the Slt2 kinase was correlated to two different processes: phosphorylation of Swi6 and transcriptional induction of genes regulated by Rlm1. To check whether the increase in Slt2 phosphorylation dependent on oxidative stress could be correlated with the activity of the kinase and the pathway, we tested both processes in cells treated with either diamide or hydrogen peroxide. We thereby confirmed this hypothesis by means of two results. One consisted on the observation that Swi6 became hyperphosphorylated upon both peroxide or diamide treatments as shown in Fig. 2B. In this figure we observe a slower mobility hyperphosphorylated Swi6 band detected with a polyclonal antibody (Dr. Noel Lowndes gift). And the second that the transcriptional levels of SLT2 and PST1 (both genes are transcriptionally regulated by Rlm1) increased concomitantly with increases in Slt2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). From these results we conclude that when cells sense the oxidative stress provoked by diamide and hydrogen peroxide, Slt2 becomes activated. Mtl1 Senses and Transduces the Oxidative Effect Caused by Diamide—We tested mid2, mtl1, wsc1, wsc2, wsc3, and wsc4 single mutants together with wsc1wsc2, mid2wsc1, and mtl1mid2 double mutants for Slt2 phosphorylation due to the addition of diamide or hydrogen peroxide to check whether any of the known cell receptors related to the cell integrity pathway were involved in sensing and signaling the oxidative stress input. In this study we decided to perform a quantitative analysis of Slt2 activation by using the following criteria: we calculated the value called induction -fold, as the ratio between quantitative levels of Slt2 phosphorylation at either 30 or 60 min and Slt2 phosphorylation level measured at time 0 (untreated cells). All of the single quantified values were also normalized with respect to their respective loading controls (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the numerical values shown in this study correspond to relative levels of Slt2 activation in samples treated with oxidative agents after different times of exposure. In some of the mutants used in this study the basal levels of Slt2 activity were significantly lower than those estimated for wild type cells. For this reason and to avoid possible misinterpretations we show the numerical values corresponding to Slt2 relative induction for each experiment. Relative induction of Slt2 phosphorylation was partly defective in mid2 mutant cells treated with diamide, whereas it was almost completely eliminated in mtl1 cells (Fig. 2C). The latter result led us to consider the possibility of Mtl1 and Mid2 being partly redundant for sensing the oxidative effect caused by diamide. To test this, we checked the status of Slt2 activity in the mtl1mid2 double mutant and obtained that for this function Mid2 and Mtl1 did not constitute additive sensors of oxidative stress. The other cell wall receptor mutants assayed displayed no significant differences with respect to their respective single mutants and wild type cells (not shown). However, different results were obtained for hydrogen peroxide: none of the mutants showed marked deficiency in the relative induction of Slt2 phosphorylation with respect to wild type levels, although a partial reduction in Slt2 phosphorylation was observed in mid2 and mid2mtl1 mutants upon 2 h of exposure to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2C). To further characterize the role of Mtl1 and Mid2 as sensors of oxidative stress caused by diamide, we tested cell viability in the presence of diamide. We observed that only the absence of Mtl1 significantly impaired cell viability in response to diamide (Fig. 2D). Moreover, overexpression of the constitutive active Pkc1 allele under the Gal1 promoter (named GalPkc1*, a gift from Dr. M. Hall, for details see Ref. 12Delley P.A. Hall M.N. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) rescued both cell viability in the mtl1 mutant (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that Mtl1 functions in the cell integrity pathway by sensing and transmitting the oxidative signal. Our results indicate that both Mtl1 and, at least in part, Mid2 are sensors for the diamide-mediated oxidative effect at the cell surface and play a role in the cell integrity pathway for this response. These findings are also consistent with the results shown above and suggest that hydrogen peroxide activates the pathway at the intracellular level. Pkc1, Rom2, and Mtl1 Are Required for Transmitting the Oxidative Signal to Slt2 and for Cell Viability in Response to Oxidative Stress—Once demonstrated that oxidative stress activates Slt2 mediated by cell wall receptors, we investigated which elements of the cell integrity pathway were involved in this activation. To do this, we treated rom2 mutant cells with either diamide or hydrogen peroxide, and upon both treatments a marked defect in Slt2 phosphorylation was observed, with respect to wild type cells (Fig. 2C). We also confirmed that Slt2 activation was totally eliminated in both pkc1 and bck1 mutants following treatments with both peroxide and diamide (Fig. 2C). These results demonstrate that upstream Pkc1 elements are required to transduce the activating signal to Slt2 upon oxidative treatment. However, at present we still cannot rule out the possibility of oxidants directly activating elements downstream of Pkc1. We tested cell viability in various mutants after diamide and peroxide treatment to gain an understanding of the physiological consequences of the involvement of the cell integrity pathway in oxidative stress response (Fig. 3). We observed that rom2 and pkc1 deletions were significantly sensitive to the oxidizing agents, whereas bck1 and mpk1 cell growth was indistinguishable from that of wild type cells (Fig. 3, A and B). It is relevant to note that we obtained the same results (qualitatively speaking) when checking with different concentrations of the two agents: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.5, 2, 4, and 6 mm in the case of hydrogen peroxide, and 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mm in the case of the diamide (data not shown). It is important to note that lack of viability of pkc1 due to the presence of the oxidizing agents was not totally rescued by sorbitol (Fig. 3B). This strongly suggests that Pkc1 function is essential for cell viability under oxidative conditions on despite of the presence of sorbitol as osmotic stabilizer and cell wall protective agent. We next performed cell viability studies in a rom2 mutant that had been transformed using the plasmid GalPkc1*. We observed that its overexpression compensated for rom2 cell death caused by diamide and peroxide (Fig. 3C). These data support that the Rom2 and Pkc1 functions are needed for cell survival against oxidation. The MAPK module downstream of Pkc1 (see Fig. 4A, bck1 and mpk1 viability) is dispensable for this cellular response.Fig. 4Diamide modifies the cell outer layer structure conferring greater resistance to zymolyase digestion and oxidating free-SH residues in cell-wall proteins.A, exponentially growing pkc1 and slt2 mutant cells in SC medium at 25 °C were treated with either diamide 4 mm for 30 min or with H2O2 1 mm for 1 h. Subsequently, 10 ml of culture at A600 of 0.6 was first washed with H2O and then with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of this buffer prior to the addition of either 0.2 or 0.5 units zymolyase. Cell lysis was estimated by measuring at A600 for the indicated periods. The pkc1 mutant was grown in the presence of the osmotic stabilizer sorbitol 0.8 m. B, when quantifying free-SH residues with DTNB (see “Materials and Methods”), the A412 was determined in intact cells treated with DTT, diamide, or hydrogen peroxide.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2133926420,"The dual membrane envelopes of Gram-negative bacteria provide two barriers of unlike nature that regulate the transport of molecules into and out of organisms. Organisms have developed several systems for transport across the inner and outer membranes. The Gram-negative periodontopathogenic bacterium Porphyromonas gingivalis produces proteinase and adhesin complexes, gingipains/adhesins, on the cell surface and in the extracellular milieu as one of the major virulence factors. Gingipains and/or adhesins are encoded by kgp, rgpA, rgpB, and hagA on the chromosome. In this study, we isolated a P. gingivalis mutant (porT), which showed very weak activities of gingipains in the cell lysates and culture supernatants. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that precursor forms of gingipains and adhesins were accumulated in the periplasmic space of the porT mutant cells. Peptide mass fingerprinting and N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the precursor proteins and the kgp′-′rgpB chimera gene product in the porT mutant indicated that these proteins lacked the signal peptide regions, consistent with their accumulation in the periplasm. The PorT protein seemed to be membrane-associated and exposed to the periplasmic space, as revealed by subcellular fractionation and immunoblot analysis using anti-PorT antiserum. These results suggest that the membrane-associated protein PorT is essential for transport of the kgp, rgpA, rgpB, and hagA gene products across the outer membrane from the periplasm to the cell surface, where they are processed and matured."

Here we report that PI4KIIIβ and PI4KIIα localize to discrete subcompartments of the Golgi complex in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. PI4KIIIβ was enriched in early Golgi compartments, whereas PI4KIIα colocalized with markers of the trans-Golgi network (TGN). To understand the temporal and spatial control of PI4P generation across the Golgi complex, we quantitated the steady state distribution of a fluorescent PI4P-binding domain relative to cis/medial Golgi and TGN markers in transiently transfected MDCK cells. The density of the signal from this PI4P reporter was roughly 2-fold greater in the early Golgi compartments compared with that of the TGN.

In addition to their function as intracellular second messengers, significant roles for PIs in the regulating interactions between the lipid bilayer and protein machinery involved in vesicle budding and traffic as well as in cytoskeletal organization have recently emerged (1Cockcroft S. De Matteis M.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2001; 180: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Balla T. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 475-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cellular signaling and intracellular trafficking events are activated independently, which requires spatial and temporal control of PI metabolism. This is mediated in part by the subcellular distribution of phosphatidylinositol kinases, which phosphorylate PIs in specific compartments of the cell, including the plasma membrane, endosomes, secretory granules, and the Golgi complex (3Gehrmann T.

Recent studies from our laboratory and others have documented an emerging role for phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) in regulating traffic along the biosynthetic pathway. These enzymes selectively catalyze the phosphorylation of PI at the D-4 position of the inositol ring to produce phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). Although PI4P serves as a major precursor of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, this lipid also has been shown to directly regulate the delivery of proteins from the Golgi complex to the plasma membrane in yeast (7Walch-Solimena C.

PI4KIIα appears to have a broader distribution in the cell and has been shown to be associated with several membrane bound organelles, including endosomes, a subcompartment of the endoplasmic reticulum, synaptic vesicles, and the Golgi complex (12Wang Y.J.

Although these two proteins function in the same organelle to generate PI4P, the suborganellar distribution of these kinases and the locations of the pools of PI4P they generate are unknown. Our previous studies in polarized MDCK cells have shown that altered PI4P metabolism has differential effects on intra-Golgi transport versus cell surface delivery, as well as on apical and basolateral traffic. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of PI4KIIIβ inhibited intra-Golgi transport, but paradoxically stimulated TGN to cell surface delivery of the apical marker influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in these cells. By contrast, overexpression of wild-type PI4KIIIβ had no effect on early Golgi transport but inhibited TGN-to-apical membrane delivery (9Bruns J.R. Ellis M.A. Jeromin A. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2012-2018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that PI4P can be regulated at the suborganellar level and has multiple and sometimes opposing roles in transport through the Golgi complex. Although changes in PI4K expression have been shown to affect total cellular phosphatidylinositol phosphate levels, it has been difficult to assess the temporal changes in PI4P distribution in the Golgi under conditions when PI4P metabolism is manipulated (9Bruns J.R.

Here we have expressed the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Fapp1, which binds to the Golgi complex in a PI4P-dependent manner, as a reporter to identify and quantify the steady state distribution of PI4P across the Golgi complex of MDCK cells. Moreover, we have examined the effects of modulating PI4K activity on this distribution. These studies allow us for the first time to correlate changes in PI4P levels and localization with kinetic effects on biosynthetic membrane traffic. Construction of Plasmids and Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses encoding PI4KIIIβ and PI4KIIIβD656A have been described previously (9Bruns J.R. Ellis M.A. Jeromin A. Weisz O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2012-2018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GFP-PI4KIIIβ, HA-PI4KIIα, and GFP-Fapp1(PH) were kindly provided by Tamas Balla (National Institutes of Health). A cDNA construct encoding the amino terminus of human β1-4-galactosyltransferase linked to yellow fluorescent protein (GalT-YFP) was a gift from Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health). To construct GST-Fapp1(PH), a SalI and EcoRI fragment containing the first 99 amino acids of Fapp1 was subcloned into the pGex 4t-1 vector. Recombinant expression of GST-Fapp1(PH) was carried out as described (18Dowler S. Currie R.A. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Kular G. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Trp15 and Arg18 within the Fapp1 sequence of GFP-Fapp1(PH) were mutagenized to Asp and Lys, respectively, using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene to generate the GFP-Fapp1(PH) N-K mutant. Cell Culture and Transfections—Transient transfections of MDCK type II cells and NRK cells were performed using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were seeded onto 12-mm coverslips and transfected 24 h later with 2 μg of plasmid DNA. Cells transfected with GFP-Fapp1(PH) or GFP-PI4KIIIβ were incubated for 12-16 h to allow for protein accumulation. The cells expressing HA-PI4KIIα were fixed and processed for indirect immunolocalization 8 h post-transfection (12Wang Y.J. Wang J. Sun H.Q. Martinez M. Sun Y.X. Macia E. Kirchhausen T. Albanesi J.P. Roth M.G. Yin H.L. Cell. 2003; 114: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). For some GFP-Fapp1(PH) quantitation studies, the cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses encoding PI4KIIIβ and PI4KIIIβD656A, then transfected 2 h later with plasmid encoding GFP-Fapp1(PH), and examined the following day. Similar results were obtained using cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding PI4K and GFP-Fapp1(PH). Fapp1(PH) Binding to Semi-permeabilized Cells—Cells transfected with a construct encoding GalT-YFP were grown on coverslips overnight. The indicated coverslips were incubated with 5 μm WMN for 1 h prior to permeabilization as described in Ref. 19Plutner H. Davidson H.W. Saraste J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1097-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar. Following permeabilization on ice, the cells were incubated with rat liver cytosol supplemented with an ATP-regenerating system and 0.2 μm GST-Fapp1(PH) for 30 min at 32 °C. Cells pretreated with WMN were incubated with cytosol supplemented with 5 μm WMN to inactivate any cytosol-associated PI4KIIIβ. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and processed for immunofluorescence. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Transfected cells were grown on coverslips, washed with PBS, fixed for 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, washed, and permeabilized with 0.1% TX-100 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% glycine. Cells were incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) followed by a 30-min incubation in PBS containing 5% normal goat serum. The coverslips were incubated for 1 h in primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, washed, incubated with secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer, washed, and mounted in Aquapolymount (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Rabbit anti-giantin (diluted 1:400) and mouse anti-GPP130 (diluted 1:500) were gifts from Adam Linstedt (Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA), Rabbit anti-furin (diluted 1:400) was from Affinity Bioreagents (Golden, CO), mouse anti-γ-adaptin (diluted 1:300) was from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA), and mouse anti-HA antibodies (diluted 1:1000) were from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Secondary antibodies (diluted 1:500; goat anti-rabbit 647 and goat anti-mouse 568 or TxRed) were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Imaging was performed on a TCS-SL confocal microscope equipped with argon and green and red heliumneon lasers (Leica, Dearfield, IL). Images were acquired by sequential scanning using a ×100 (1.4 numerical aperture) plan apochromat oil objective and the appropriate filter combination. Quantitative Immunofluorescence Analysis—High expression levels of GFP-Fapp1(PH) disrupted cellular morphology; therefore only cells in which cis/medial and TGN compartment markers were distinctly separated were chosen for quantitative analysis. In experiments with cells coexpressing GFP-Fapp1(PH) and PI4KIIIβD656A, quantitation was performed on cells that retained detectable levels of GFP-Fapp1(PH) binding to the Golgi complex. Confocal images of GFP-Fapp1(PH)-expressing cells were saved as 12-bit images and imported into MetaMorph® software (Universal Imaging). Each channel was individually thresholded, and binary masks of the cis/medial and TGN staining profiles were generated. A minimal region of overlap between the two masks that could not be identified conclusively as either compartment was removed from each mask. Binary masks were used to extract the intensity, area, and mean voxel intensity of GFP-Fapp1(PH) staining in each compartment. Both PI4KIIIβ and PI4KIIα have been localized to the Golgi complex of mammalian cells, but their sub-Golgi distribution is not known. To determine the intra-Golgi localization of these enzymes, MDCK cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP-PI4KIIIβ (Fig. 1, A-I) or HA-tagged PI4KIIα (Fig. 1, J-O). The cells were fixed 6-8 h after transfection and processed for triple label immunofluorescence using antibodies against cis/medial Golgi and TGN marker proteins (Fig. 1, A-I). Confocal microscopy demonstrated that GFP-PI4KIIIβ localized primarily with the cis/medial Golgi protein giantin (Fig. 1C) but displayed little overlap with the TGN markers furin (Fig. 1F) or γ-adaptin (Fig. 1I). Similar to previous studies, we found that PI4KIIα localized not only to Golgi structures but also to punctate cytosolic structures consistent with endosomes (12Wang Y.J. Wang J. Sun H.Q. Martinez M. Sun Y.X. Macia E. Kirchhausen T. Albanesi J.P. Roth M.G. Yin H.L. Cell. 2003; 114: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 16Balla A. Tuymetova G. Barshishat M. Geiszt M. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20041-20050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) In contrast to PI4KIIIβ, the Golgi-localized pool of PI4KIIα staining did not colocalize with giantin (Fig. 1L) but overlapped extensively with γ-adaptin (Fig. 1O). This is consistent with the reported function of this enzyme in generating a pool of PI4P that recruits AP-1 coat machinery (12Wang Y.J. Wang J. Sun H.Q. Martinez M. Sun Y.X. Macia E. Kirchhausen T. Albanesi J.P. Roth M.G. Yin H.L. Cell. 2003; 114: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Coexpression of GFP-PI4KIIIβ and HA-tagged PI4KIIα confirmed the distinct localizations of PI4KIIIβ and PI4KIIα (Fig. 1R). These data suggest that PI4KIIIβ and PI4KIIα function independently to generate PI4P-rich domains in the cis/medial Golgi and TGN of MDCK cells. To assess whether the PH domain of Fapp1 is an appropriate reporter of Golgi PI4P in MDCK cells, a GFP-tagged PH domain of Fapp1 (GFP-Fapp1(PH)) was transiently expressed in MDCK cells. Confocal microscopy images show GFP-Fapp1(PH) localized to the perinuclear region of the cell in structures that are also stained by antibodies specific for Golgi proteins (Fig. 2). To confirm that GFP-Fapp1(PH) localization to the Golgi complex requires binding of PI4P, a mutant protein was constructed in which selective recognition of PI4P is predicted to be disrupted. In this protein (GFP-Fapp1(PH) N-K), tryptophan and arginine residues in the conserved lipid recognition site within the PH domain have been mutagenized to asparagine and lysine, respectively. As predicted, these mutations largely inhibited Fapp1(PH) binding to PI4P as assessed by lipid strip binding and liposome pelleting assays. 2A. Blumental-Perry, C. Haney, E. A. Harrison, K. M. Weixel, O. A. Weisz, S. C. Watkins, and M. Aridor, manuscript in preparation. However, GFP-Fapp1(PH) N-K retained weak binding specificity for other PI species, confirming that the mutant protein is not grossly misfolded. When expressed in MDCK cells, GFP-Fapp1(PH) N-K localized primarily to the cytoplasm, and no Golgi staining was observed (Fig. 2). In some cells, a small amount of staining was also observed at the cell surface and on non-Golgi membranes, possibly as a result of GFP-Fapp1(PH) N-K binding to distinct PI species. Thus, GFP-Fapp1(PH) localizes to the Golgi complex of MDCK cells in a PI4P-specific manner. To examine the sub-Golgi distribution of PI4P, MDCK cells transiently expressing GFP-Fapp1(PH) were fixed and processed for indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies specific for markers of the cis/medial Golgi and TGN (GPP130 and furin, respectively; Fig. 3). The compartments in which GPP130 and furin reside could be readily resolved by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3A, bottom left panel). Comparison of the staining pattern of GFP-Fapp1(PH) with these markers revealed that GFP-Fapp1(PH) primarily localized with the cis/medial Golgi marker protein, GPP130, (Fig. 3A, bottom middle panel) and showed little overlap with furin in the TGN (Fig. 3A, bottom right panel). We used images from 20 cells to quantitate the relative density of Golgi-associated GFP-Fapp1(PH) in areas of colocalization with GPP130 versus furin. This quantitation method allows us to detect the average binding of GFP-Fapp1(PH) per unit pixel as opposed to the total intensity of staining in each compartment; importantly, the resulting values are independent of the relative area of each compartment that is captured in the optical section. The intensity of GFP-Fapp1(PH) staining was nearly twice as high in the cis/medial Golgi as in the TGN (see Fig. 5).Fig. 5The intra-Golgi distribution of GFP-Fapp1(PH) in MDCK cells is modulated by PI4K activity. MDCK cells transiently expressing GFP-Fapp1(PH) were infected prior to transfection with a control adenovirus or viruses encoding PI4KIIIβ or PI4KIIIβD656A or were cotransfected with PI4KIIα. The cells were processed for triple-labeled immunofluorescence using antibodies against GPP130 and furin as in Fig. 3. Confocal images of individual optical sections were imported into Metamorph™, and the mean voxel intensity of GFP-Fapp1(PH) in regions that colocalized with cis/medial Golgi versus TGN markers was quantitated as described under “Materials and Methods.” The graph shows the percentage of GFP-Fapp1(PH) voxel intensity in cis/medial versus TGN compartments calculated for each condition. Whereas overexpression of wild-type PI4KIIIβ has no effect on the relative intra-Golgi distribution of GFP-Fapp1(PH), expression of either PI4KIIIβD656A or PI4KIIα significantly alters the distribution of this probe across the Golgi complex. *, p < 0.001 versus control by Student's t test; control, n = 24; PI4KIIIβ, n = 24; PI4KIIIβD656A, n = 23; PI4KIIα, n = 7.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The cis/medial Golgi of MDCK cells is not disrupted by incubation with brefeldin A (BFA); however, the TGN becomes tubulated and dispersed under these conditions (20Hunziker W.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 933-943PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to confirm the localization of GFP-Fapp1(PH) in MDCK cells, we examined the effect of BFA (10 min, 5 μg/ml) on the localization of this probe. The staining pattern of the TGN marker furin was dramatically altered in BFA-treated cells compared with untreated controls (Fig. 3B, middle panels). In contrast, the overall staining pattern of GFP-Fapp1(PH), although slightly more dispersed than in control cells, was relatively unaffected by this drug (Fig. 3B, left-hand panels). No change in these patterns was observed even upon significantly longer incubations with BFA. 3K. M. Weixel and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observation. Together, these data suggest that a sizable pool of PI4P exists in the cis/medial Golgi of MDCK cells at steady state. A recent report has localized both full-length Fapp proteins and Fapp PH domains to primarily the TGN in NRK and COS7 cells (22Godi A. Di Campli A. Konstantakopoulos A. Di Tullio G. Alessi D.R. Kular G.S. Daniele T. Marra P. Lucocq J.M. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed a similar distribution when we expressed GFP-Fapp1(PH) in NRK cells (Fig. 3C, compare colocalization with giantin versus furin). Furthermore, brief treatment with BFA caused the majority of GFP-Fapp1(PH) signal to dissociate from the Golgi complex in the majority of NRK cells, as previously reported (22Godi A. Di Campli A. Konstantakopoulos A. Di Tullio G. Alessi D.R. Kular G.S. Daniele T. Marra P. Lucocq J.M. De Matteis M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 393-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). 3K. M. Weixel and O. A. Weisz, unpublished observation. The compartmentalization of PI4KIIIβ to the cis/medial Golgi and the observation that GFP-Fapp1(PH) colocalized primarily with a cis/medial Golgi marker in MDCK cells suggested that PI4KIIIβ may be responsible for the synthesis and maintenance of this pool of PI4P. To test whether PI4KIIIβ activity is required to maintain the PI4P pool detected by GFP-Fapp1(PH), MDCK cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding GFP-Fapp1(PH) and a dominant-negative, catalytically inactive mutant of PI4KIIIβ (PI4KIIIβD656A). Following fixation, the distribution of GFP-Fapp1(PH) was examined by confocal microscopy. In control cells, GFP-Fapp1(PH) was almost exclusively associated with the Golgi complex, with cytoplasmic staining observed only in cells expressing very high levels of the protein (Fig. 4A, left panel). The distribution of GFP-Fapp1(PH) was much more variable in cells expressing PI4KIIIβD656A. Golgi-associated GFP-Fapp1(PH) was detected in the majority of cells; however, it was significantly dimmer. Furthermore, the relative intensity of cytoplasmic GFP-Fapp1(PH) staining compared with Golgi staining was considerably higher than in control cells (Fig. 4A, right panel). In some PI4KIIIβD656A-expressing cells, GFP-Fapp1(PH) signal was completely dissociated from the Golgi; these cells were omitted from the quantitative immunofluorescence studies described below. As an alternative test for the role of PI4KIIIβ activity in the production of the early Golgi pool of PI4P in MDCK cells, GFP-Fapp1(PH)-expressing cells were treated with 10 μm WMN for 1 h at 37 °C prior to fixation. WMN is traditionally used as an inhibitor of PI3Ks (23Yano H. Nakanishi S. Kimura K. Hanai N. Saitoh Y. Fukui Y. Nonomura Y. Matsuda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25846-25856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and at higher concentrations functions as a potent inhibitor of type III but not type II PI4Ks (13Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J.

Under these treatment conditions, MDCK cells developed large vacuoles that began to fill the cell interior. As a result, the Golgi complex became slightly dispersed (Fig. 4C); however, the distribution of furin remained essentially coincident with that of giantin, and biosynthetic transport was maintained for several hours.3 Consistent with our observations in MDCK cells expressing PI4KIIIβD656A, WMN treatment caused a significant portion of the GFP-Fapp1(PH) signal to dissociate from the Golgi complex (Fig. 4C). In some cells, no residual Golgi staining was observed (Fig. 4C, arrows). These data suggest that PI4KIIIβ is largely responsible for maintaining the steady state pool of PI4P in the Golgi complex at steady state in MDCK cells. To confirm the requirement for PI4KIIIβ activity in this process, we determined the effect of WMN treatment on de novo synthesis of Golgi PI4P using an in vitro reconstitution assay. MDCK cells transiently expressing the TGN marker GalT-YFP were incubated with 5 μm WMN for 1 h. Following WMN treatment, the cells were permeabilized with digitonin, then washed, and incubated with rat liver cytosol containing an ATP-regenerating system, GST-Fapp1(PH) and 5 μm WMN (to inhibit cytosolic PI4KIIIβ). The cells were then incubated at 32 °C for 30 min followed by fixation and immunostaining with antibodies against GST and GPP130. Under control conditions where no WMN was added, GST-Fapp1(PH) localized almost exclusively with GPP130, consistent with our observations in intact cells (Fig. 4B, upper left panel; GST-Fapp1(PH) green, GPP130 red). In contrast, little overlap between GST-Fapp1(PH) staining and GalT-YFP was observed (Fig. 4B, lower left panel; GST-Fapp1(PH), green, and GalT-YFP, red). The distribution of GST-Fapp1(PH) was significantly altered in WMN-treated cells. Under these conditions, GST-Fapp1(PH) staining was adjacent to but no longer coincident with GPP130 and instead localized almost completely with GalT-YFP (Fig. 4B, right panels). In control cells only 35% of the total GST-Fapp1(PH) colocalized with GalT-YFP-positive compartments, consistent with the fraction of GFP-Fapp1(PH) staining we observed in the late Golgi of intact cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, 62% of the GST-Fapp1(PH) staining colocalized with GalT-YFP in cells reconstituted with WMN-treated cytosol. The experiments described above demonstrate that modulation of PI4KIIIβ activity in vivo and in vitro alters the recruitment of GFP-Fapp1(PH) to the Golgi complex as well as its suborganellar distribution. To quantitate the effects of altered PI4K expression on the steady state distribution of PI4P, MDCK cells expressing GFP-Fapp1(PH) alone"

Despite these findings, the molecular basis of Notch signaling in the vasculature is poorly understood. Here we report that activation of Notch signaling mediated through members of the HRT family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors represses smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation and expression of genes encoding smooth muscle cell contractile markers. Activation of Notch receptors by Jagged1 or forced expression of the constitutively active Notch1 intracellular domain in C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts inhibited myocardin-dependent transcription of SMC-restricted genes and activity of multiple SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements. Consistent with these findings, forced expression of HRT2 inhibited myocardin-induced expression of SMC-restricted genes and activity of SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements. Moreover, forced expression of HRT2 repressed transcription of multiple SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements in A10 SMCs. The repressive function of HRT2 was not mediated via the capacity of HRT2 to bind SMC CArG elements or by disruption of myocardin-SRF protein complexes. Structure-function analyses of HRT2 indicated that repression required the basic DNA binding domain and additional C-terminal sequence. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Notch signaling represses myocardin-dependent SMC transcription. These data are consistent with a model wherein Notch signaling represses SMC differentiation and maintenance of the contractile SMC phenotype.

In contrast to the skeletal and cardiac muscle cell lineages, where cellular differentiation is functionally coupled to irreversible exit from the cell cycle, SMCs retain the capacity to proliferate and modulate their phenotype during postnatal development (2Bochaton-Piallat M.L.

Although a reproducible transition from a “contractile” to a “synthetic” SMC phenotype is observed with passage of primary vascular SMCs in culture, in the intact vasculature SMCs are pleiotropic, expressing unique permutations and combinations of both contractile and synthetic genes that are continuously modulated in response to various stimuli and developmental cues (3Kumar M.S. Owens G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). For example, during embryonic angiogenesis, SMCs express relatively high levels of SMC contractile proteins as well as proteins required for cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation (4Majesky M.W. Tex. Heart Inst. J. 1994; 21: 78-85PubMed Google Scholar, 5Majesky M.W. Giachelli C.M. Reidy M.A. Schwartz S.M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This developmental program is also partially recapitulated in SMCs following arterial injury and in atherosclerotic plaques (6Shanahan C.M. Cary N.R. Osbourn J.K. Weissberg P.L. Arterioscler. Thromb.

SRF activates SMC contractile genes by physically associating with the recently identified cardiac and SMC-restricted SAP domain transcription factor, myocardin (13Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Curr. Opin.

Forced expression of myocardin in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells (which express SRF) activates a set of genes encoding SMC contractile proteins (15Du K.L. Ip H.S. Li J. Chen M. Dandre F. Yu W.

Moreover, there is no evidence of vascular SMC differentiation in myocardin-deficient mouse embryos, and these mice fail to survive past embryonic day 10.5, most likely due to vascular insufficiency (17Li S. Wang D.Z. Wang Z. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9366-9370Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). By contrast, relatively little is understood about the molecular mechanisms regulating vascular patterning and the response of vascular SMCs to growth factor stimulation and vessel wall injury. Increasing evidence suggests that Notch receptors and downstream Notch effectors in the Hairy-related transcription (HRT) family play important roles during embryonic and postnatal vascular development (for a review, see Ref. 18Iso T. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 543-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway regulates cell fate decisions and cellular differentiation mediated through cell-cell interactions (for a review, see Ref. 19Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4918) Google Scholar). When bound by either Delta-like or Jagged ligands, Notch receptors on the cell surface are activated, resulting in proteolytic cleavage and translocation of the Notch intracellular domain (ICN) to the nucleus. In the nucleus, ICN associates with the transcription factor CSL (CBF1/Su(H)/Lag-1)/RBP-J, providing DNA-binding specificity to the ICN-CSL complex. The ICN-CSL complex physically associates with transcriptional coactivators activating or derepressing transcription of target genes in the HES (Hairy-and-enhancer of split) and HRT (Hairy-related) transcription factor families (20Iso T. Kedes L. Hamamori Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 194: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). HRT1, HRT2, and HRT3 are direct targets of Notch signaling and are expressed at high levels in the embryonic vasculature (21Iso T. Chung G. Hamamori Y. Kedes L. J. Biol.

There is some controversy regarding the expression of Notch and HRT family members following vascular injury, most likely resulting from variations in the animal models employed and/or temporal assessment of Notch and HRT expression following injury (24Lindner V.

Analyses of spontaneous and genetically engineered mutations in Notch receptors and HRTs has provided strong evidence that Notch signaling is critical for normal vascular development, patterning, and homeostasis. Notch1-deficient mice die at embryonic day 9.5 and exhibit disorganized vascular patterning in the embryo and yolk sac (27Swiatek P.J. Lindsell C.E. del Amo F.F. Weinmaster G. Gridley T. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 707-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Similarly, the combined absence of HRT1 and HRT2 in mice leads to defective angiogenesis and embryonic lethality at embryonic day 9.5–10, whereas loss of HRT2 alone results in perinatal lethality due to cardiac and outflow tract defects (28Fischer A. Schumacher N. Maier M. Sendtner M. Gessler M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 901-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 29Donovan J. Kordylewska A. Jan Y.N. Utset M.F. Curr.

However, some HRT2-deficient mice survive into adulthood and exhibit dysfunctional vascular smooth muscle responses to arterial injury and growth factor stimulation (31Sakata Y. Xiang F. Chen Z. Kiriyama Y. Kamei C.N. Simon D.I. Chin M.T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 2069-2074Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the zebrafish, mutation of the gridlock gene, an HRT2 ortholog, results in failure to establish arterial versus venous patterning (32Zhong T.P. Childs S. Leu J.P. Fishman M.C. Nature. 2001; 414: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In mice, mutation of Jagged1 results in lethality at embryonic day 10.5 and is accompanied by abnormal vascular patterning and failure to remodel the primary vascular plexus in the yolk sac (33Xue Y. Gao X. Lindsell C.E. Norton C.R. Chang B. Hicks C. Gendron-Maguire M. Rand E.B. Weinmaster G. Gridley T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). In humans, Alagille syndrome, caused by a mutation in the Notch ligand Jagged1 gene, is associated with arteriopathy, most notably involving the pulmonary artery (34Kamath B.M. Spinner N.B. Emerick K.M. Chudley A.E. Booth C. Piccoli D.A. Krantz I.D. Circulation. 2004; 109: 1354-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Similarly, the human CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) syndrome is a heritable arteriopathy caused by a mutation in the human Notch3 gene (35Joutel A. Corpechot C. Ducros A. Vahedi K. Chabriat H. Mouton P. Alamowitch S. Domenga V. Cecillion M. Marechal E. Maciazek J. Vayssiere C. Cruaud C. Cabanis E.A. Ruchoux M.M. Weissenbach J. Bach J.F. Bousser M.G. Tournier-Lasserve E. Nature. 1996; 383: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). The experiments described herein examine the molecular basis of Notch function in cultured cells with particular emphasis on determining the effect of Notch signaling on SMC differentiation and maintenance of the SMC phenotype. We observed that Notch-induced HRT2 expression represses myocardin-induced SMC transcription and gene expression. Furthermore, HRT2 repressed multiple transcriptional regulatory elements controlling expression of SMC contractile genes in SMCs. Surprisingly, the repressive function of HRT2 is not mediated by disruption of myocardin-SRF protein complexes bound to DNA; nor does it reflect recruitment of HDAC activity by HRT2. Structure-function studies revealed that Notch-mediated repression is dependent upon the basic DNA binding domain and C terminus of HRT2. Together, these data suggest a model wherein Notch signaling converges upon and functionally antagonizes myocardin-dependent SMC differentiation and the contractile SMC phenotype. Plasmids—The expression plasmid (pcDNA3-ICN1) encoding the mouse Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN1) was prepared by subcloning the PCR-amplified ICN1 cDNA into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Expression plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged mouse SRF (pcDNA3 HA-SRF) and untagged mouse myocardin (pcDNA3-myocardin), were generated by subcloning the mouse SRF and myocardin cDNAs, respectively, into the expression vector pcDNA3. An amino-terminal FLAG-tagged myocardin expression plasmid (pFLAG-myocardin) was a gift of E. Olson (University of Texas Southwestern) and described previously (36Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid pcDNA3-GATA4 was derived from subcloning mouse GATA4 cDNA into the pcDNA3 vector. PCR fragments encoding mouse HRT2 deletion mutants were generated by subcloning HRT2 cDNA encoding amino acids 1–61 (HRT2:B), 1–103 (HRT2:BH), 1–164 (HRT2:BHO), 1–326 (HRT2:BHO+), and 1–339 (full-length HRT2) into pcDNA3.1 by TOPO directional cloning including a C-terminal V5 epitope tag (Invitrogen). All plasmids were sequenced to ensure accuracy of PCR amplification. A plasmid expressing N-terminal Myc-tagged HRT2, within which the basic domain was replaced by two amino acids, LE (HRT2(B–)), was described previously (37Nakagawa O. McFadden D.G. Nakagawa M. Yanagisawa H. Hu T. Srivastava D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13655-13660Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids for mouse HRT1 (pHRT1-V5) and HRT3 (pHRT3-V5) were prepared by subcloning PCR-amplified HRT1 and HRT3 cDNA, respectively, into pcDNA3.1 with a C-terminal V5 epitope tag. The luciferase reporter plasmids –3.5 SM22α-luc, –441 SM22α-luc, pCArGx4-luc, pSME4x4-luc, pPI-Act-luc, and pPI-Myo-luc were described previously (15Du K.L. Ip H.S. Li J. Chen M. Dandre F. Yu W. Lu M.M. Owens G.K. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2425-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The ARNT expression plasmid, pcDNA3-Arnt, was kindly provided by M. C. Simon (University of Pennsylvania). Cell Culture and Transfections—C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) fibroblasts, 293T cells, and A10 rat aortic smooth muscle cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) at 37 °C. Plasmid transfections were performed using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science) with a Fugene 6/DNA ratio of 3:1. For 10T1/2 cells, maintenance medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum 2 h prior to transfection, and the cells were harvested after 48 h. Where indicated, 24 h after plasmid transfection, 10T1/2 cells were placed in medium containing 300 nm trichostatin-A (TSA; Sigma) and harvested 24 h later. Notch1+/– embryonic stem (ES) cell clones (kindly provided by J. Rossant, University of Toronto) were described previously (38Conlon R.A. Reaume A.G. Rossant J. Development. 1995; 121: 1533-1545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notch1–/– ES were obtained by subjecting independently derived Notch1+/– clones to selection in G418 at a concentration of 1.5 μg/ml as described previously (39Mortensen R.M. Conner D.A. Chao S. Geisterfer-Lowrance A.A. Seidman J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2391-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Southern blotting was performed to verify mutation of both Notch1 alleles (data not shown). Retrovirus Preparation and Cell Transduction—Control MigR1- and MSCV-N1ΔE-GFP-expressing virions were prepared as described (40Aster J.C. Xu L. Karnell F.G. Patriub V. Pui J.C. Pear W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7505-7515Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). 2 × 105 10T1/2 cells were plated on a 60-mm tissue culture dish containing maintenance medium and incubated for 24 h at 37° C. Cells were infected with 1 ml of virus stock (titer >50%) in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. After an 8-h incubation at 37° C, 3 ml of fresh maintenance medium was added, and the cells were harvested after 40 h. The cell population was sorted for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. GFP-positive cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and exhibited stable fluorescence expression for at least 10 passages. Notch Ligand Stimulation Assay—Notch signaling was induced in 10T1/2 cells plated on dishes displaying immobilized Jagged1 ligand as described (41Ross D.A. Kadesch T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) except that the Myc-tagged Jagged1 was substituted with an Fc-Jagged1 fusion protein (kindly provided by T. Kadesch, University of Pennsylvania). Real Time RT-PCR Analysis—For quantitative analysis of endogenous gene expression levels, total RNA was harvested from either ES cells or 10T1/2 cells using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen), and 2 μg was subjected to oligo(dT)-primed reverse transcription (Invitrogen). cDNA was added to each reaction mixture containing gene-specific primers (5 μm) and SYBR Green 2× Master mix (Applied Biosystems) followed by thermal cycling between 95 and 60° C in a DNA Engine Opticon 2 System (MJ Research). mRNA quantification was calculated according to the 2–ΔΔc(t) method (42Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Expression levels of target genes were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels. All experiments were repeated at least twice, and results from a representative experiment are shown with S.D. values. Primer sequences for real time PCR of cDNAs for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, SMα-actin, SM-MyHC, SM22α, SM-calponin-h1, myocardin, HRT1, HRT2, and HRT3 were described previously (15Du K.L.

Luciferase Reporter Assays—10T1/2 or A10 cells were seeded at 20,000 cells/well in a 24-well tissue culture plate and transfected with 25 ng of luciferase reporter construct, 25 ng of myocardin expression plasmid, and the indicated amounts of ICN1 or HRT expression plasmids with additional pcDNA3 vector added to normalize total DNA concentration in each transfection. The Renilla expression plasmid, pRL-TK (5 ng), was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were measured by a dual luciferase assay (Promega). Each experiment was repeated at least two times with each reaction performed in triplicate. Results displayed with S.D. are from representative experiments. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—EMSAs were performed with in vitro transcribed and translated HA-SRF, FLAG-myocardin, and HRT2-V5 and the radiolabeled SME-4 CArG-box containing oligonucleotide probe as described previously (43Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; : 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). 1 μg each of pcDNA3 HA-SRF, pFLAG-myocardin, and pHRT2-V5 were added to a T7 transcription-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate per the manufacturer's instructions (Promega), and reaction products were verified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Equal amounts of lysate reactions were incubated with 32P-labeled SME-4 probe in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Biosciences) and binding buffer and incubated for 30 min on ice as described previously (43Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; : 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Reaction products were separated on a 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.25× TBE (1× TBE is 100 mm Tris, 100 mm borate, and 2 mm EDTA). For cold competition experiments, 75–150 ng of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction. Where indicated, 1 μg of anti-SRF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), or anti-V5 (Invitrogen) antibody was added to the binding reaction. EMSAs were also performed with nuclear extracts prepared from transfected 293T cells expressing HA-SRF (SRF); HA-SRF and FLAG-myocardin (Myoc/SRF); or HA-SRF, FLAG-myocardin, and HRT2-V5 (Myoc/SRF/HRT2). Nuclear extracts were prepared from transfected cells as described previously (43Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; : 2266-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). 10 μg of nuclear extract were added to the binding reaction with radiolabeled SME-4 probe under the reaction conditions described above. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—293T cells were transiently co-transfected with expression plasmids bearing V5 epitope-tagged HRT2 with GATA4, SRF, or FLAG epitope-tagged myocardin. Whole cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4° C with anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and Protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitated protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-GATA4 antibody (C-20; Santa Cruz), anti-SRF antibody (G-20; Santa Cruz), and anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) using an anti-SRF antibody (G20; Santa Cruz). Input DNA and DNA isolated from precipitated chromatin were subjected to 33 cycles of conventional PCR using primers flanking the 5′ CArG element from the SM-MyHC promoter as described (44Manabe I. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Activated Notch Signaling Represses Myocardin-dependent SMC Gene Expression and Transcription—To examine whether Notch signaling modulates SMC differentiation, we utilized 10T1/2 fibroblasts, which, in response to myocardin, differentiate and express a set of genes encoding SMC contractile markers, including SMα-actin, SM-MyHC, calponin-h1, and SM22α (45Yoshida T. Sinha S. Dandre F. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Kremer B.E. Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). First, we tested whether exposure of 10T1/2 cells to the Notch ligand Jagged1 alters myocardin-induced SMC differentiation. Jagged1 can activate Notch signaling whether it is on a neighboring cell or immobilized on a tissue culture plate (46Varnum-Finney B. Wu L. Yu M. Brashem-Stein C. Staats S. Flowers D. Griffin J.D. Bernstein I.D. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4313-4318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 10T1/2 cells plated on either Jagged1-coated or control tissue culture dishes were transfected with the pcDNA3-myocardin expression plasmid or the control plasmid pcDNA3. 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested, and SMα-actin, SM-MyHC, and SM22α mRNA were quantified by real time RT-PCR. Consistent with our previous report (15Du K.L. Ip H.S. Li J. Chen M. Dandre F. Yu W. Lu M.M. Owens G.K. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2425-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), cells transfected with pcDNA3-myocardin exhibited a dramatic increase in SMα-actin, SM-MyHC, and SM22α gene expression (Fig. 1A). However, when 10T1/2 cells grown on Jagged1-coated plates were transfected with pcDNA3-myocardin, a 50–80% inhibition of myocardin-induced SMα-actin, SM-MyHC, and SM22α gene expression was observed (Fig. 1A). Of note, the relative level of myocardin gene expression assessed by real time RT-PCR was equivalent whether cells were plated on Jagged1 or control plates (data not shown). As expected, the Notch target genes HRT1, HRT2, and HRT3 were significantly induced when exposed to Jagged1 ligand (Fig. 1B). In contrast, in cells grown in the presence of Jagged1 ligand, there was no change in expression levels of myocardin-independent genes, including SRF, smoothelin, and cardiac α-MyHC (data not shown). To determine whether Notch-mediated repression of genes encoding SMC differentiation markers is mediated through the Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN1), 10T1/2 cells were infected and stably transduced with either the Notch1ΔE (N1ΔE)-eGFP fusion retrovirus to facilitate constitutive Notch1 signaling activity or the control parental MigR1 retrovirus. As shown in Fig. 1C, consistent with the results described above, N1ΔE-expressing cells transfected with the pcDNA3-myocardin expression plasmid demonstrated a significant reduction of myocardin-induced SMC gene expression. Compared with the MigR1 control cells, 50–90% reductions of myocardin-induced expression of the SMα-actin, SM-MyHC, and SM22α genes were observed (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Notch signaling represses myocardin-dependent SMC gene activation, and this repression is recapitulated by constitutive expression of ICN1. To determine whether Notch signaling directly represses previously identified SMC-restricted transcriptional regulatory elements, we compared the capacity of myocardin to activate SMC transcriptional regulatory elements previously validated in transgenic mice (10Strobeck M.

Res. 1999; 84: 852-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). 10T1/2 cells were co-transfected with either an expression plasmid encoding the constitutively active Notch1 intracellular domain (ICN1) or the control plasmid pcDNA3 and luciferase reporter plasmids under the transcriptional control of the SMα-actin promoter/enhancer (pPI-Act-luc), SM-MyHC promoter/enhancer (pPI-Myo-luc), and SM22α promoter (–3.5 SM22α-luc), respectively. Forced expression of ICN1 repressed myocardin-induced activation of the SM22α promoter by 68%, the SMα-actin promoter/enhancer by 42%, and the SM-MyHC promoter/enhancer by 42% compared with cells co-transfected with the control pcDNA3 expression plasmid (Fig. 2). These results extend our findings above showing Notch-mediated repression of endogenous SMC gene expression and suggest that repression of myocardin-induced SMC gene expression is regulated, at least in part, at the level of transcription.

https://openalex.org/W2064333692,"The oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) represents the final step in a metabolic cycle that culminates in visual pigment regeneration. Retinol dehydrogenase 5 (RDH5) is responsible for a majority of the 11-cis-RDH activity in the RPE, but the formation of 11-cis-retinal in rdh5–/– mice suggests another enzyme(s) is present. We have previously shown that RDH11 is also highly expressed in RPE cells and has dual specificity for both cis- and trans-retinoid substrates. To investigate the role of RDH11 in the retinoid cycle, we generated rdh11–/– and rdh5–/–rdh11–/– mice and examined their electrophysiological responses to various intensities of illumination and during dark adaptation. Retinoid profiles of darkadapted rdh11–/– mice did not show significant differences compared with wild-type mice, whereas an accumulation of cis-esters was detected in rdh5–/– and rdh5–/–rdh11–/– mice. Following light stimulation, 73% more cis-retinyl esters were stored in rdh5–/–rdh11–/– mice compared with rdh5–/– mice. Single-flash ERGs of rdh11–/– showed normal responses under dark- and light-adapted conditions, but exhibited delayed dark adaptation following high bleaching levels. Double knockout mice also had normal ERG responses in dark- and light-adapted conditions, but had a further delay in dark adaptation relative to either rdh11–/– or rdh5–/– mice. Taken together, these results suggest that RDH11 has a measurable role in regenerating the visual pigment by complementing RDH5 as an 11-cis-RDH in RPE cells, and indicate that an additional unidentified enzyme(s) oxidizes 11-cis-retinol or that an alternative pathway contributes to the retinoid cycle.

Double knockout mice also had normal ERG responses in dark- and light-adapted conditions, but had a further delay in dark adaptation relative to either rdh11–/– or rdh5–/– mice. Taken together, these results suggest that RDH11 has a measurable role in regenerating the visual pigment by complementing RDH5 as an 11-cis-RDH in RPE cells, and indicate that an additional unidentified enzyme(s) oxidizes 11-cis-retinol or that an alternative pathway contributes to the retinoid cycle. In retinal photoreceptors, a photon of light isomerizes 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, a reaction that initiates a signal transduction cascade culminating in a visual sensation (1Okada T.

Both rod and cone opsin visual pigments contain the lightabsorbing chromophore 11-cis-retinal (4Filipek S. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Palczewski K. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 851-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Vision is sustained through biochemical reactions involving the regeneration of isomerized chromophores in rod and cone photoreceptors in a multistep retinoid cycling pathway (reviewed in Refs. 5McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar and 6Saari J.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism to regain light sensitivity is not completely understood, but it has been proposed to involve two distinct pathways, one for cone and the other for rod photoreceptors (7Mata N.L. Radu R.A. Clemmons R.C. Travis G.H. Neuron. 2002; 36: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Both pathways ultimately regenerate 11-cis-retinal conjugated to opsins by a retinylidene bond. However, cone visual pigments are regenerated much faster than rhodopsin in rods (reviewed by McBee et al. (5McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar)). To complete the visual cycle, photoisomerized all-trans-retinal is first reduced to all-trans-retinol within the photoreceptors. This reaction is followed by the movement of all-trans-retinol to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) 1The abbreviations used are: RPE, retinal pigment epithelium; EM, electron microscopy; ERG, electroretinogram; ES, embryonic stem; SDR, short chain dehydrogenase reductase; RDH, retinol dehydrogenase; ROS, rod outer segment(s); WT, wild type; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; EST, expressed sequence tag. for storage in retinosomes as all-trans-retinyl esters (8Imanishi Y.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), which are available for isomerization to 11-cis-retinol. The final reaction in the pathway involves oxidation of 11-cis-retinol to 11-cis-retinal and movement of the chromophore back to the photoreceptors (Fig. 1). The importance of the retinoid cycle for the development and maintenance of normal vision has prompted efforts to identify the critical enzymes and cofactors responsible for regulating each reaction of the cycle. Hereditary mutations in key regulatory enzymes involved in this pathway underlie a range of disorders from mild visual acuity problems to severe retinal dystrophies (see Retnet at www.sph.uth.tmc.edu). Although the enzymatic components of many retinoid cycle reactions are well characterized, the key mediator(s) for 11-cis-retinol oxidation to 11-cis-retinal remains to be identified. Leading candidates include one or more of the retinol dehydrogenase (RDH) enzymes, a subfamily of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) superfamily. RDH5 is expressed in RPE cells and has been shown to oxidize 11-cis-retinol in vitro. Mutations in the RDH5 gene have been linked to the clinical diagnosis of fundus albipunctatus and are associated with delayed dark adaptation (10Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, rdh5–/– mice display no retinal degeneration and have normal dark adaptation kinetics at bleaching levels that cause a delay in patients with fundus albipunctatus (11Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P. Van Vugt A.H. Van Hooser J.P. Wieringa B.E. Deutman A.F. Palczewski K. Ruether K. Janssen J.J. Mol. Cell.

Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 590-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This finding indicates that there are other RDH enzymes that facilitate retinol oxidation in the RPE. We have recently identified additional members of the RDH family that are expressed in the eye and exhibit the ability to catalyze reduction/oxidation reactions involving retinoids (13Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45537-45546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). One of these enzymes, RDH11, was initially designated as prostate short chain dehydrogenase reductase 1 (PSDR1) based on its hallmark SDR protein motifs and its high transcript expression level in the human prostate (14Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently RDH11 was identified as a gene regulated by sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a transcription factor that functions to coordinately regulate the expression of enzymes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis (15Kasus-Jacobi A. Ou J. Bashmakov Y.K. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32380-32389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). SDR enzymes also utilize steroids including RDH5. RDH11, however, lacks reactivity with steroid substrates but reduces other short chain aldehydes such as nonanal and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (15Kasus-Jacobi A. Ou J. Bashmakov Y.K. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32380-32389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RDH5 has NADH cofactor specificity and is more efficient in oxidizing retinols rather than reducing retinals in vitro (16Simon A. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Eriksson U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1107-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In contrast, RDH11 has NADPH specificity and catalyzes the reduction of retinals ∼50-fold more efficiently than it does the oxidation of retinol in vitro (17Kedishvili N.Y. Chumakova O.V. Chetyrkin S.V. Belyaeva O.V. Lapshina E.A. Lin D.W. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28909-28915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo substrate of RDHs might depend upon the relative concentration of substrates in the immediate environment, and several lines of evidence indicate that RDH11 can have 11-cis-RDH activity in the RPE. First, RDH11 is expressed in RPE cells. Second, the remaining enzymatic activity in rdh5–/– RPE exhibited NADPH cofactor specificity and reduced all-trans-, 9-cis-, and 11-cis-retinal (11Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D.

Van Hooser J.P. Kuksa V. McBee J.K. He Y.G. Janssen J.J. Driessen C.A. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32456-32465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), a characteristic consistent with the known subcellular localization of RDH11 (19Belyaeva O.V. Stetsenko A.V. Nelson P. Kedishvili N.Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14838-14845Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we examine the physiological role of RDH11 and in particular its role in the visual retinoid cycle by generating and characterizing mice with a targeted deletion of the rdh11 gene (rdh11–/–) and combined deletions of RDH5 and RDH11 (rdh5–/–rdh11–/–). Electrophysiological and biochemical measurements demonstrate that RDH11 plays a minor but complementary role to RDH5 in the flow of retinoids and thus in dark adaptation. Analyses of the rdh5–/–rdh11–/– mice reveal the existence of additional enzymes in the retina with 11-cis-RDH(s) activity, or the presence of an alternative pathway capable of generating the visual pigment. Animals—All animal experiments employed procedures approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington Animal Care Committees, and conformed to recommendations of the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia and recommendations of the Association of Research for Vision and Ophthalmology. Animals were maintained in complete darkness, and all manipulations were done under dim red light employing a Kodak No. 1 Safelight filter (transmittance >560 nm). Construction of Targeting Vector—A probe containing nucleotides 913–1213 of the mouse rdh11 cDNA was used to isolate the rdh11 genomic clone containing exons 2 to 7 from a 129S4 mouse library (P. Soriano, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA). The genomic region between exon 1 and 2 was PCR amplified using primers O1, 5′-GTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGAACCGGGGTGTGTCTAGGAT-3′ and O2, 5′-AGGAAACAGCTATGACCATCCGGGAAGCTGAACATTAGA-3′ (Fig. 2) and the KOD XL polymerase (Novagen, Madison, WI). The targeting vector was generated by PCR using KOD HiFi polymerase (Novagen). The 5′-arm was generated by amplifying a 1.8-kb fragment using primers O3, 5′-AGAAGTCCGCGGCACGTGGTCAAAGGATGGTTTC-3′ and O4, 5′-AAGTGCGGCCGCATGCTTGCCTCTAAGCCTGTTG-3′, and an equivalent length 3′-arm was amplified using primers O5, 5′-AAGTGTCGACTCAGAACTCAATAGGGGCTTGG-3′ and O6, 5′-AGTAAGCTTTGTGTAGGCAGAACGTGAAGCA-3′. The 5′-arm was subcloned into the NotI and SacII restriction sites of pPGKneolox2 DTA.2 (P. Soriano) whereas the 3′-arm was subcloned into the HindIII and SalI sites. Neomycin (neo) was used for positive selection and diphtheria toxin A-fragment (DTA) was used for negative selection. Homologous Recombination and Genotyping—Targeting vector was linearized with SacII and electroporated into R1_129 embryonic stem (ES) cells (20Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar), and colonies were selected in 300 μg/ml G418 for 9 days. Homologous recombination events were screened by Southern blotting and PCR using primers O7, 5′-AGGAGGGTTGCACTTTTTGCTCTCT-3′ and O8, 5′-GCCCAGTCATAGCCGAATAGCCTCT-3′ (Fig. 2A), which hybridized to the genomic sequence outside of the targeting arm construct and within the neo gene, respectively. Positive clones were microinjected into C57BL6 blastocysts and the resulting male chimeric mice were screened for germline transmission. Genotyping by PCR analysis was carried out using primers O9, 5′-ACTATGGCGTGCATGTGGAAGT-3′ and O10, 5′-TCTCCTTCCCAATGCCTGTG-3′ for wild-type (WT) (389 bp) and O9 and O11, 5′-GCTAAAGCGCATGCTCCAGA-3′ for targeted deletion (300 bp). The PCR product with primers O9 and O11 was cloned and sequenced to verify proper targeting of rdh11. A second PCR analysis with primers O9 and O12, 5′-GGACCCTACCCTTCTGCAACTG-3′ was used to determine WT (1.6 kb), heterozygous (1.6 and 2.4 kb), and homozygous (2.4 kb) genotypes. RDH5 mice were previously generated and characterized by Drs. Carola A. G. G. Driessen and Jacques J. M. Janssen (18Jang G.F. Van Hooser J.P. Kuksa V. McBee J.K. He Y.G. Janssen J.J. Driessen C.A.

Vision Res. 2003; 43: 3075-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Genotypes of RDH5 mice were determined by PCR using primers, KORDH-s1, 5′-GGGCAGCTGCAGTCTGCACCATC-3′ and KORDH-a1 5′-GGGCAAGACCTGACCTGGGGGC-3′, which produced a 2.9-kb fragment for the WT allele and a 1.5-kb fragment for the disrupted allele. Southern Blotting—Genomic tail or ES cell DNA was digested overnight with EcoRV and electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA samples were transferred onto a nylon membrane by capillary method. The membrane was incubated with a 700-bp DNA probe amplified with primers P13, 5′-ATAAGTCCCGCTGTCCTCTT-3′ and P14, 5′-TCTCCTGGCTCCTAGTAATCTAA-3′ and was subsequently labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Real-Time Quantitative PCR—RNA was TRIzol-extracted from liver and brain according to the manufacturer's protocol. 5 μg of RNA was used to generate the cDNA using 0.14 mm oligo-dT (22-mer) primer and 0.2 mm of each dNTP and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was carried out in triplicate for each sample using SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, San Francisco, CA), 0.2 μm of each primer, and 8 ng of cDNA. The PCR protocol used was 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. PCR was performed and analyzed using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. Mouse RDH11-14 gene expression was normalized to S16 expression. PCR without cDNA templates did not produce significant amplification products. Specificity of the primers was verified by the amplification of a single PCR product, which was determined by observing a single dissociation curve from each tissue. Primers for the real-time PCR are the following: mRDH11_F 5′-ACCAAGAGCACATGGGTAGC-3′, mRDH11_R 5′-CTCATCAGTCCTGGGTGCTT-3′; mRDH12_F 5′-CCAGGAACTCCTACCTGCTG-3′, mRDH12_R 5′-ACCCACATCCTCTTGCAGTC-3′; mRDH13_F 5′-GAGGAGCGAGTAGACATTCTGG-3′, mRDH13_R 5′-CCAGGGACGAGAGATTGATG-3′; mRDH14_F 5′-TGGTCAGGAATGGCATGTTG-3′, mRDH14_R 5′-GCATGATTGCGGCTAGACTG-3′; mS16_F 5′-AGGAGCGATTTGCTGGTGTGGA, mS16_R 5′-GCTACCAGGCCTTTGAGATGGA-3′. Immunoblotting—Mouse testes were solubilized in 6 volumes (w/v) of T-PER tissue protein extraction buffer (Pierce Biotechnology). 30 μg of protein extract was separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrophoretically transferred onto 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked in PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBST) and 5% milk (PBSTM) and labeled with an anti-RDH11 polyclonal antibody (2479) diluted to 1:5000 in PBSTM. After washing membranes with PBST, blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) at 1:10,000 dilution, and antibody labeling was detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce). Anti-RDH11 polyclonal antibody was generated against the C-terminal peptide LWDVSCDLLGLPVDW conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by Genemed Synthesis Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin (Pierce) as the standard. Analyses of Retinoids—All experimental procedures related to extraction, derivatization, and separation of retinoids from dissected mouse eyes were carried out as described previously (22Van Hooser J.P. Liang Y. Maeda T. Kuksa V. Jang G.F. He Y.G. Rieke F. Fong H.K. Detwiler P.B. Palczewski K. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2003; 85: 944-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). All reactions involving retinoids were carried out under dim red light. Retinoids were separated by normal phase HPLC (Beckman, Fullerton, CA, Ultrasphere-Si, 4.6μ 250 mm) with 10% ethyl acetate and 90% hexane at a flow rate of 1.4 ml/min with detection at 325 nm, using an HP1100 HPLC with a diode array detector and HP Chemstation A.03.03 software. Electroretinograms (ERGs)—Prior to recording, mice were dark-adapted overnight. Under safety light, mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection using 20 μl/g body weight of 6 mg/ml ketamine and 0.44 mg/ml xylazine diluted with 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl. The pupils were dilated with 1% tropicamide. A contact lens electrode was placed on the eye, and a reference electrode and ground electrode were placed in the ear and on the tail. ERGs were recorded with the universal testing and electrophysiologic system UTAS E-3000 (LKC Technologies, Inc. Gaithersburg, MD). The light intensity was calibrated by the manufacturer and computer-controlled. The mice were placed in a Ganzfeld chamber, and scotopic and photopic responses to flash stimuli were each obtained from both eyes simultaneously. Single Flash Recording—Flash stimuli had a range of intensities (–3.7–2.8 log cd•s•m–2), and white light flash duration was adjusted according to intensity (from 20 μs to 1 ms). 3–5 recordings were made with >10-s intervals, and for higher intensity intervals, intervals were 10 min or as indicated. There were no significant differences between the first and the fifth flash. Light-adapted responses were examined after bleaching at 1.4 log cd•m–2 for 15 min. Typically, four to eight animals were used for the recording of each point in all conditions. Double Flash Recording—The protocol was followed as previously published with some modifications (25Howes K.A. Pennesi M.E. Sokal I. Church-Kopish J. Schmidt B. Margolis D. Frederick J.M. Rieke F. Palczewski K. Wu S.M. Detwiler P.B. Baehr W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A test flash was delivered to suppress the circulating current of the rod photoreceptors. The recovery of this current was monitored by delivering a second flash, termed the probe flash. The interval time between two flashes varied from 200 to 2000 ms. The intensity of the test flash and probe flash was 0.4 and 1.6 log cd•s•m–2, respectively. Each trial was performed separately with 120-s interval time for dark adaptation. The amplitude of the probe flash alone was confirmed throughout the experiment to ensure that this time was sufficient. These probe flashes were also used to normalize the response of probe flashes following a test flash. The normalized amplitude of the probe flash a-wave versus the time between two flashes was plotted and fit by the linear regression algorithm in the SigmaPlot 2002 ver. 8.02 program. Dark Adaptation After Intense Constant Illumination—Mice were dark-adapted overnight and then bleached with the background light of a Ganzfeld chamber (500 cd•m–2) for 3 min. After the light was turned off, a single-flash ERG at –0.2 cd•s•m–2 was used to monitor recovery of a-wave amplitude every 5 min for 60 min. The recovery ratio was calculated by normalizing single flash a-wave amplitude responses at various times following bleaching to the WT dark-adapted a-wave response at the identical flash intensity of –0.2 cd•s•m–2. The recovery ratio versus time after bleaching was plotted and fit by the linear regression algorithm in the Sigma Plot 2002 ver. 8.02 program. Leading edges of the ERG responses were fitted with a model of rod photoreceptor activation as described previously (23Van Hooser J.P. Aleman T.S. He Y.G. Cideciyan A.V. Kuksa V. Pittler S.J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Palczewski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8623-8628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was carried out using the one-way ANOVA test. Transmission Electron Microscopy (EM)—For transmission EM, mouse eyecups were fixed primarily in 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1.6% paraformaldehyde in 0.08 m PIPES, pH 7.4, containing 2% sucrose, initially at room temperature for ∼1 h then at 4 °C for 24 h. The eyecups were then washed with 0.13 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, and post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, for 1 h at room temperature. The eyecups were dehydrated through a methanol series and transitioned to the epoxy embedding medium with propylene oxide. The eyecups were embedded for sectioning in Eponate 812. Ultrathin sections (60–70 nm) were stained with aqueous saturated uranium acetate and Reynold's formula lead citrate prior to viewing with a Philips CM10 EM. Generation of rdh11 Knock-out Mice—To determine the physiological role of RDH11, we generated rdh11–/–-null mice by deleting exons 2 and 3 through homologous recombination (Fig. 2A). Exon 2 contains the NADP(H)-binding site, which is essential for enzyme activity. If the short transcript for exon 1 is stably expressed, it will produce a 22-amino acid long peptide. Alternative splicing of exon 1 to exons 4, 5, 6, or 7 creates a frameshift resulting in a premature stop codon. Southern blotting and PCR analysis identified embryonic stem (ES) cell clones with the proper homologous recombination event for germline transmission. Southern blotting probed with the 5′-fragment derived from the rdh11 gene labeled the anticipated DNA fragment sizes of 5.9 kb for the WT allele and 6.5 kb for the targeted allele (Fig. 2B). PCR screening with a primer outside the targeting vector arm and another within the neo gene verified the Southern results (Fig. 2C). Of three male chimeras with 80–90% agouti coat color, one had germline transmission of the mutant rdh11 allele. All the experiments in this report used mice originating from this ES cell clone. Crosses of heterozygous rdh11+/– mice produced offspring with genotypes in accordance with expected Mendelian ratios (Fig. 2, D and E). Breeding of homozygous rdh11–/– mice produced average litter sizes (∼7–10 pups) and the offspring had normal survival and growth, indicating that rdh11–/– mice are fertile and healthy. Besides the retina, RDH11 is highly expressed in the liver and testes. At 2 months of age, tissues of rdh11–/– mice exhibited no histological differences grossly or upon microscopic analysis of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissues in comparison with organs from WT mice (data not shown). Relative to WT mice, immunoblotting analysis demonstrated the loss or reduction of RDH11 protein in testes from rdh11–/– or rdh11+/– mice, respectively (Fig. 3A). Quantitative PCR results of rdh11 mRNA expression were concordant with the protein level for RDH11 (Fig. 3B). Rdh11 transcripts were not detected in rdh11–/– liver but were measured in liver tissue from rdh11+/– and rdh11+/+ mice. Expression levels of rdh11 homologues, rdh12, 13, and 14, were analyzed to ensure that rdh11 on chromosome 12 was targeted and not the homologues. Rdh12, which is located ∼16 kb from rdh11 on chromosome 12, has the same intron-exon genomic organization and shares 43% nucleotide identity with rdh11. Transcripts of rdh11 homologues exhibited similar expression levels in the livers of different rdh11 genotypes (Fig. 3B), indicating the correct targeted disruption of rdh11 and a lack of transcriptionally based compensation for the loss of rdh11. Retinoid Analysis—To investigate the in vivo role of RDH11 in vertebrate retinoid cycling between photoreceptors and RPE cells, retinoid levels in the eyes of WT, rdh11–/–, rdh5–/–, and rdh5–/–rdh11–/– mice were measured 48 h after dark adaptation, or 15 min after a probe flash. Typical HPLC separation profiles of retinoids are illustrated in Fig. 4. In dark-adapted conditions rdh11–/– eyes had similar levels of retinoids relative to those in WT mice. Relative to WT mice, rdh5–/– mice had elevated levels of 11/13-cis-retinyl esters, which further increased 15 min after a single light flash that photoactivated ∼35% of rhodopsin (24Maeda T. Van Hooser J.P. Driessen C.A. Filipek S. Janssen J.J. Palczewski K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 85: 944-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4, peaks 1 and 2 and Table I), in agreement with previously published data (11Driessen C.A. Winkens H.J. Hoffmann K. Kuhlmann L.D. Janssen B.P. Van Vugt A.H. Van Hooser J.P. Wieringa B.E. Deutman A.F. Palczewski K. Ruether K. Janssen J.J. Mol. Cell.

The separation of 13-cis- from 11-cis-retinyl esters was particularly challenging, and only partial separation of these esters was accomplished (identified by characteristic UV/visible spectra). Interestingly, after a flash probe, rdh5–/–rdh11–/– mice had even greater amounts of 11/13-cis-retinyl esters relative to those in rdh5–/– mice (Fig. 4, peaks 1 and 2). Conversely, after the first critical 15 min of dark adaptation, the 11-cis-retinal chromophore regenerated with similar kinetics in all the mice.

https://openalex.org/W2157725526,"Methylation of DNA is involved in tissue-specific gene control, and establishment of DNA methylation pattern in the genome is thought to be essential for embryonic development. Three isoforms of Dnmt1 (DNA methyltransferase 1) transcripts, Dnmt1s, Dnmt1o, and Dnmt1p, are produced by alternative usage of multiple first exons. Dnmt1s is expressed in somatic cells. Dnmt1p is found only in pachytene spermatocytes, whereas Dnmt1o is specific to oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Here we determined that there is a tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (T-DMR) in the 5′ region of Dnmt1o but not in that of the Dnmt1s/1p. The methylation status of the Dnmt1o T-DMR was distinctively different in the oocyte from that in the sperm and adult somatic tissues and changed at each stage from fertilization to blastocyst stage, suggesting that active methylation and demethylation occur during preimplantation development. The T-DMR was highly methylated in somatic cells and embryonic stem cells. Analysis using Dnmt-deficient embryonic stem cell lines revealed that Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b are each partially responsible for maintenance of methylation of Dnmt1o T-DMR. In particular, there are compensatory and cooperative roles between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. Thus, the regulatory region of Dnmt1o, but not of Dnmt1s/1p, appeared to be a target of DNA methylation. The present study also suggested that the DNA methylation status of the gene region dynamically changes during embryogenesis independently of the change in the bulk DNA methylation status.

The present study also suggested that the DNA methylation status of the gene region dynamically changes during embryogenesis independently of the change in the bulk DNA methylation status. DNA methylation of the vertebrate genome occurs predominantly at cytosine residues in cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpGs) 1The abbreviations used are: CpGs, cytosine-guanine dinucleotides; T-DMR, tissue-dependent differentially methylated region; ES, embryonic stem; RT, reverse transcription; En, embryonic day n. (1Gruenbaum Y. Stein R. Cedar H. Razin A. FEBS Lett. 1981; 124: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). About 70% of CpGs are methylated, mainly in the repressive heterochromatin region and in repetitive sequences such as retrotransposable elements (2Yoder J.A. Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Formation of the cell type-specific DNA methylation pattern is one of the epigenetic events accompanying the production of diverse cell types in the body (3Shiota K. Kogo Y. Ohgane J. Imamura T. Urano A. Nishino K. Tanaka S. Hattori N. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Generally, DNA methylation in gene-containing regions of the genome is inversely correlated with the transcriptional activity of associated genes (4Kass S.U. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P.

We have previously shown that the rSphk1 (rat sphingosine kinase 1) gene, which has multiple alternative first exons embedded in a CpG island, has a tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (T-DMR), with its methylation status inversely correlated with the expression of one of the rSphk1 mRNA subtypes (11Imamura T. Ohgane J. Ito S. Ogawa T. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Genomics. 2001; 76: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the rPL-1 (rat placental lactogen 1) gene, exclusively expressed in the placenta and having no CpG island at its 5′ region, has a T-DMR that is hypomethylated in the placenta compared with other tissues (12Cho J.H. Kimura H. Minami T. Ohgane J. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 3389-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, T-DMRs were also found in the 5′ region of two developmentally essential genes in the mouse: Oct4 (octamer binding transcription factor 4) and Sry (sex-determining region on the Y chromosome). The T-DMRs of the Oct4 and Sry genes are hypomethylated in cells/tissues in which these genes are expressed (13Hattori N. Nishino K. Ko Y.G. Ohgane J. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17063-17069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 14Nishino K. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Biol.

Thus, DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing is involved in regulation of various genes regardless of the richness of CpGs. In mammals, there are five members of the DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase (Dnmt) family: Dnmt1, Dnmt2, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L (15Bestor T. Laudano A. Mattaliano R. Ingram V. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 971-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 16Yoder J.A. Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 17Okano M. Xie S. Li E.

Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development. 2002; 129: 1983-1993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dnmt1 is considered to be a maintenance methyltransferase based on the in vitro enzyme assay in which it preferentially recognized hemimethylated DNA (2Yoder J.A. Soman N.S. Verdine G.L. Bestor T.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 20Pradhan S. Talbot D. Sha M. Benner J. Hornstra L. Li E. Jaenisch R. Roberts R.J.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Dnmt1 gene in the mouse leads to global loss of methylation and biallelic expression or silencing of imprinted genes (24Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar, 25Li E. Beard C. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1993; 366: 362-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar, 26Caspary T. Cleary M.A. Baker C.C. Guan X.J. Tilghman S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3466-3474Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Unlike Dnmt1, biological activity of Dnmt2 did not reveal methyltransferase activity specific for CpGs (16Yoder J.A. Bestor T.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), and knock-out of the Dnmt2 gene in the mouse resulted in no detectable abnormality (18Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2536-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b have de novo methyltransferase activity in vitro (17Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar), and a lack of either of them caused extensive perturbations in DNA methylation patterns and premature (Dnmt3a-/-) or prenatal (Dnmt3b-/-) lethality (27Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). Three mRNA isoforms, Dnmt1s, Dnmt1p, and Dnmt1o, are expressed from the Dnmt1 locus because of alternative usage of multiple first exons. Dnmt1s is expressed in somatic cells, whereas Dnmt1p and Dnmt1o are exclusively expressed in male and female germ cells, respectively (28Mertineit C. Yoder J.A. Taketo T. Laird D.W. Trasler J.M. Bestor T.H. Development. 1998; 125: 889-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dnmt1p mRNA, expressed in pachytene spermatocytes, does not produce the active form of Dnmt1 protein, because short open reading frames in the first exon of Dnmt1p (exon 1p) likely interfere with translation of the authentic open reading frame. In contrast, translation from the ATG codon in the first exon of a Dnmt1o isoform (exon 1o) is apparently compatible with translation from an in-frame downstream ATG, which produces an N-terminal truncated active Dnmt1 protein (Dnmt1o). Dnmt1o solely exists in growing oocytes and preimplantation embryos until it is subsequently replaced by Dnmt1s at the blastocyst stage (28Mertineit C. Yoder J.A. Taketo T. Laird D.W. Trasler J.M. Bestor T.H. Development. 1998; 125: 889-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Carlson L.L. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2536-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Dnmt1o protein is of interest because it is excluded from the nucleus at all stages of preimplantation development but the eight-cell stage (28Mertineit C. Yoder J.A. Taketo T. Laird D.W. Trasler J.M. Bestor T.H. Development. 1998; 125: 889-897Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Carlson L.L. Page A.W. Bestor T.H. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2536-2541Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 30Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Doherty A.S. Bartolomei M.S. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The expression of Dnmt1s requires a cis-element in the promoter region and is controlled by transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 (32Kishikawa S. Murata T. Kimura H. Shiota K. Yokoyama K.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2961-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Dnmt1 transcription during cell cycle progression is modulated by two other cis-elements in the promoter region, which are regulated in a complex fashion by E2F and other transcription factors through E2F-Rb-HDAC-dependent and -independent pathways (33Kimura H. Nakamura T. Ogawa T. Tanaka S. Shiota K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3101-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although the regulatory mechanism for spatio-temporal expression of Dnmt1o isoform is poorly understood, the strictly regulated expression of Dnmt1o suggests that there may be tissue- or developmental stage-specific epigenetic marks on the upstream region of the first exon of Dnmt1o isoform. To address this possibility, here we investigate the methylation status of CpGs in the 5′ upstream region of Dnmt1o and Dnmt1s/1p in germ cells and preimplantation embryos. Animal Treatment and Reagents—The experiments were carried out according to the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals (Graduate School of Agriculture and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo). C57BL/6NCrj (B6) mice were purchased from Oriental Yeast Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and kept under regulated temperature (22–25 °C), humidity (40–60%), and illumination cycles (14 h light of and 10 h of dark) with ad libitum access to food and water. All of the reagents were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) unless otherwise stated. Collection of Oocytes and Embryos—Adult B6 females (7 weeks old) were injected with 7.5 IU of serum gonadotropin from a pregnant mare (Teikoku Hormone Mfg. Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Teikoku Hormone Mfg. Co., Ltd.) with a 48-h interval. Metaphase II oocytes were then collected from the oviducts 20 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection. The collected metaphase II oocytes were denuded of cumulus cells by incubation in 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo, Japan) in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature. To obtain embryos, superovulated B6 females were individually caged with a B6 stud male overnight and examined for the presence of a vaginal plug the next morning. Noon of the day on which vaginal plug was observed was designated as embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Preimplantation embryos were recovered from oviducts at E0.5 (early one-cell stage), E1.0 (late one-cell stage), E1.5 (two-cell stage), E2.0 (four-cell stage), and E2.5 (eight-cell stage). Some of the eight-cell stage embryos were cultured in 50-μl microdrops of potassium-enriched synthetic oviductal medium (KSOM) (34Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 186-187Google Scholar) under mineral oil (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air to obtain morula and blastocyst stage embryos. Postimplantation embryos (E7.5) were dissected out of uterine horns. For RNA/DNA preparation, only the morphologically normal oocytes and embryos were pooled and stored in 5 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated phosphate-buffered saline at -80 °C until use. Approximately 150 oocytes and 30–80 preimplantation embryos were used for DNA preparation. Kidney, liver, and ovary were collected from 60-day-old adult B6 mice Embryonic Stem (ES) Cells—The ES cell line MS12, derived from B6 mouse embryo (35Kawase E. Suemori H. Takahashi N. Okazaki K. Hashimoto K. Nakatsuji N. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1994; 38: 385-390PubMed Google Scholar), was a kind gift from Dr. H. Suemori (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan). The ES cell line J1, derived from 129S4/SvJae mouse embryo, and its Dnmt-deficient derivatives (Dnmt1-/-, Dnmt3a-/-, Dnmt3b-/-, Dnmt3a-/-, and Dnmt3b-/-) were kindly provided by Dr. E. Li (Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research). Both alleles (four alleles in the case of the double mutant) were targeted in vitro to produce these Dnmt-deficient ES cells (27Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). The ES cells were cultured on mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich)-treated STO cells in the presence of 1000 units/ml leukemia inhibitory factor (ESGRO®; Chemicon, Temecula, CA) under standard conditions (34Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 186-187Google Scholar). Before preparation of genomic DNA from ES cells, mitomycin C-treated STO cells were removed by taking advantage of differences in adherence to the dish surface between STO and ES cells. In brief, ES cells co-cultured with STO cells were trypsinized and replated on fresh tissue culture dishes. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, nonattached cells were collected and added to fresh tissue culture dishes again. Following a second 30-min incubation at 37 °C, nonattached ES cells were recovered and stored at -80 °C until use. Sodium Bisulfite Genomic Sequencing—Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously (14Nishino K. Hattori N. Tanaka S. Shiota K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22306-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Sodium bisulfite genomic sequencing was carried out as described previously (36Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar, 37Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5240) Google Scholar) with slight modification. In brief, EcoRI-digested genomic DNAs (0.5–2.0 μg) were denatured in 0.33 m NaOH for 15 min at 37 °C. Sodium metabisulfite (pH 5.0) and hydroquinone were added to final concentrations of 2.0 m and 0.5 mm, respectively. After incubation in the dark at 55 °C for 12 h, modified DNAs were purified with Wizard DNA Clean-Up system (Promega, Madison, WI). The reaction was stopped by further incubation in NaOH at a final concentration of 0.3 m at 37 °C for 15 min followed by ethanol precipitation. Purified DNAs were suspended in 20 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA. Bisulfite-modified DNA (2 μg) was amplified with AmpliTaq Gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and one of the following primer sets (see Fig. 1): o-1–1, 5′-TGTTTGTTTTGTGTAATAGGGTTTT-3′ and o-1–2, 5′-CCTAATACCCACAAAAACCAAAAAA-3′; o-2–1, 5′-GTTGTTTTTTGGTTTTTGTGGGTAT-3′ and o-2–2, 5′-CAACCTTAACAACACAACTAAAATA-3′; and s-1, 5′-GTTGGTAAGTAAATTAGAGTTATTT-3′ and s-2, 5′-ACTCCCTCAAACTCCCAATCAATAA-3′. The thermocycling program was 43 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, preceded and followed by 10 min of incubation at 95 and 72 °C, respectively. The amplified PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Collected oocytes or embryos in 5 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated phosphate-buffered saline were combined with 100 μl of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two μg of glycogen (Fermentas, Hanover, MD) were added as a carrier before ethanol precipitation. Isolated RNA was finally dissolved in 10 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The RNA preparations from adult tissues were also performed with the TRIzol reagent. Synthesis of cDNA was carried out using random hexamers and SuperScript II first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Amplifications by PCR were performed with 1-μl aliquots of cDNA in a total reaction volume of 20 μl using rTaq polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). Expressions of Dnmt1o, Dnmt1s, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b were specifically detected by using the following respective primer sets: Dnmt1o forward, 5′-GGTTGATTGAGGGTCATT-3′ and Dnmt1o reverse, 5′-GCAGGAATTCATGCAGTAAG-3′; Dnmt1s forward, 5′-GGGTCTCGTTCAGAGCTG-3′ and Dnmt1s reverse, 5′-GCAGGAATTCATGCAGTAAG-3′; Dnmt3a forward, 5′-CGAGGGCTTGACATCAGGGTC-3′ and Dnmt3a reverse, 5′-CACTCCGCTTCTCCAAGTCTCC-3′; and Dnmt3b forward, 5′-GTAGCGCAGCGATCGGCGCCGG-3′ and Dnmt3b reverse, 5′-CCCGCTGGCACCCTCTTCTTC-3′. The thermocycling program used for Dnmt1o and Dnmt1s was 36 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, preceded and followed by incubation at 95 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 10 min, respectively. For Dnmt3a, the program was 1 cycle at 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. For Dnmt3b, the program was 1 cycle at 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 1 cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. A primer set for β-actin (forward, 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCAA-3′; reverse, 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′) was also used as a positive control to ensure the integrity and quantity of RNA. PCR was performed for β-actin under the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were electrophoresed on 3% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immunocytochemistry—Anti-rat Dnmt1 antiserum has been generated against a region common to Dnmt1o and Dnmt1s, the N-terminal polypeptide (amino acids 108–318) of Dnmt1 protein (38Kimura H. Takeda T. Tanaka S. Ogawa T. Shiota K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Anti-Dnmt3a and anti-Dnmt3b antibodies (39Chen T. Ueda Y. Xie S. Li E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38746-38754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) were generously provided by Dr. E. Li through Dr. H. Sasaki (National Institute of Genetics). The embryos were freed of zona pellucida by brief exposure to acidified Tyrode's solution (pH 2.5) and fixed for 15 min at room temperature in a freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed specimens were incubated in a blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Triton X-100) for at least 1 h. For immunofluorescence detection of Dnmt1o, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b, the anti-Dnmt1 antiserum, the anti-Dnmt3a antibody, and the anti-Dnmt3b antibody were diluted 1:50, 1:1000, and 1:1000, respectively, in blocking buffer. Bound antibodies were detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) diluted 1:500 in blocking buffer. Immunostained embryos were counterstained in 10 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidinophenylindole (Roche Applied Science) in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. For microscopic examination, immunostained embryos were transferred into a drop of mounting medium (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) placed on a glass microscope slide. A coverslip was gently placed on the drop containing embryos to spread the mounting medium and slightly flatten the specimen and was subsequently sealed with clear nail polish. The embryos were then examined using an Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Tokyo, Japan) equipped for epifluorescence with fluorescein and UV filter sets. The obtained images were processed by deconvolution software IPLab program (M&S, Tokyo, Japan). Sequence Analysis—The genomic DNA sequence of Dnmt1 locus was obtained from GenBank™ (accession number NT_039472). Sequences of part of exon 1o and its downstream region were substituted with those from another GenBank™ entry (accession number AF175410) because they appeared ambiguous in NT_039472. Content of GCs and CpG frequency were analyzed and plotted with a web-based on-line program CpGPlot (bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/cpgplot.html) developed by the European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite. Genomic Structure and CpG Composition around the First Exons of Dnmt1—The positions of the three alternative first exons of Dnmt1 gene and CpG sequences are illustrated in Fig. 1. The first exon of Dnmt1o (1o) is located ∼7 kb upstream of the first exon of Dnmt1s (1s), and the first exon of Dnmt1p (1p) is located 85 bp downstream of 1s. There is a CpG island containing 39 CpGs, which covers 1s and a part of 1p (-68 to 332 relative to the putative transcription initiation site of Dnmt1s). There are 20 CpGs between 500 and 1500 bp upstream of 1o, whereas there are only two CpGs within 500 bp upstream of 1o (Fig. 1A). In the present study, we intensively investigated the methylation status of 18 of 20 distal CpGs in the 5′ region of 1o and of 49 CpGs within and around the CpG island at 1s/1p. The distal 18 CpGs in the 5′ region of 1o are designated hereafter by alphabetical letters, a to r, to avoid confusion and were divided into three groups (I, II, and III) for convenience to describe dynamic change of DNA methylation status. Groups I, II, and III contain five CpGs (a–e), nine CpGs (f–n), and four CpGs (o–r), respectively (Fig. 1A). Expression of Dnmt1 Isoforms Dnmt1o and Dnmt1s in the Oocytes and Embryos—Transcripts of Dnmt1o and Dnmt1s in oocytes, embryos before and after implantation, and ovary and ES cells were analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2). Dnmt1o transcripts were detected in oocytes, one- and two-cell stage embryos, morula, and ovary, whereas they were not detectable in four- and eight-cell stage embryos, blastocysts, ES cells, and E7.5 embryos. No Dnmt1o transcripts were detected in the kidney and liver of adult mice (data not shown). In contrast, Dnmt1s transcripts were detectable in all cells and tissues examined; then amount of Dnmt1s transcript was high in E7.5 embryos, ovary, and ES cells, whereas it was low in other embryos/cells including the oocytes and preimplantation embryos. Thus, expression of Dnmt1o is not allowed in the restricted embryonic stages including four-cell, eight-cell, and blastocyst stages and embryos after implantation. In this context, the expression of Dnmt1o is more severely controlled compared with Dnmt1s. It is unclear whether the de novo expression of Dnmt1o occurs during embryogenesis. Various mRNA species transcribed in oocytes are carried over into the preimplantation zygotes, and transcription is limited at early embryonic stages (40Aoki F. Worrad D.M. Schultz R.M. Dev. Biol. 1997; 181: 296-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 41Aoki F. Hara K.T. Schultz R.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2003; 64: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the one-cell stage embryos contained higher amounts of Dnmt1o mRNA than did the oocytes. Considering that the amount of β-actin mRNA was comparable between the oocytes and one-cell stage embryos, the increase in Dnmt1o transcript seems to be due to de novo synthesis after the fertilization. Similarly, resumption of Dnmt1o mRNA detection at the morula stage likely results from bona fide transcription at this stage rather than carry over from previous stages because transcripts were not detectable at the four- and eight-cell stages. Thus, transcription of Dnmt1o likely occurs in one-cell and morula stage embryos, whereas it is suppressed in four-cell, eight-cell, and blastocyst stage, and postimplantation embryos. DNA Methylation Status of the 5′ Regions of 1o and 1s/1p in Germ Cells and Somatic Tissues—DNA methylation status of CpGs in the 5′ regions of 1o and 1s/1p was investigated in adult somatic tissues and germ cells by the sodium bisulfite sequencing method. At the 5′ regions of 1o, all of the CpGs examined (a–r) appeared to be hypermethylated in sperm, kidney, and liver, whereas in the oocyte, 13 (f–r) were almost completely unmethylated, and the rest (a–e) were hypermethylated. All CpGs examined in the upstream region of 1s/1p were unmethylated in sperm and were also barely methylated in the oocyte, kidney, and liver (Fig. 3). A complete lack of methylation of CpGs in the 1s/1p upstream region was evident in all of the cells and tissues examined, including early embryos and ES cells (data not shown). These data indicate that there is a tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (T-DMR) in the 5′ region of Dnmt1o but not of Dnmt1s/1p. The CpG methylation status of Dnmt1o T-DMR was dependent on developmental stage, and it was different in the oocyte from sperm and adult somatic tissues. Dynamic Changes in DNA Methylation Status of Dnmt1o T-DMR during Preimplantation Development—We then investigated developmental changes in DNA methylation status of Dnmt1o T-DMR during preimplantation development (Fig. 4). In the early one-cell stage embryos collected at E0.5, the methylation pattern of CpG a–r was already distinct from that in the sperm and the oocyte; CpGs h–j and o–r were perfectly methylated, whereas other CpGs (f, g, and k–n) were unmethylated. This result clearly showed that site-specific de novo methylation (CpGs h–j and o–r) of the oocyte genome as well as site-specific active demethylation (CpGs f, g, and k–n) of the sperm genome occurred after fertilization to establish the one-cell stage-specific DNA methylation pattern of Dnmt1o T-DMR. The initial DNA methylation pattern of Dnmt1o T-DMR achieved after fertilization was maintained in the late one-cell stage embryos collected at E1.0. Further analyses with later stage embryos revealed that all but CpG n of Dnmt1o T-DMR were unmethylated at the two-cell stage, suggesting that active demethylation took place again between the one-cell and two-cell stages. At the four-cell stage, a particular set of CpGs (a and f–n) were fully methylated, and other CpGs (b–e and o–r) remained unmethylated, indicating that site-specific de novo methylation occurred again between the two- and four-cell stages. The methylation pattern at the eight-cell stage was also unique and suggested de novo methylation at four CpGs (b–e). Active demethylation occurred again at CpGs a–n, resulting in an almost totally unmethylated pattern of CpGs in the morula in which Dnmt1o transcripts were detected. The methylation status of each CpG showed a nearly all-or-none pattern until the morula stage, suggesting that all blastomeres at each developmental stage before mo"

https://openalex.org/W2041168003,"The human copper transporter 1 (hCtr1), when heterologously overexpressed in insect cells, mediates saturable Cu uptake. In mammalian expression systems, a rapid Cu-dependent internalization of hCtr1 has been reported in cells that overexpress epitope-tagged hCtr1 when exposed to Cu in the external medium. This finding led to the suggestion that such internalization may be a step in the hCtr1 transmembrane Cu transport mechanism. We have demonstrated that preincubation in Cu-containing media of sf9 cells stably expressing hCtr1 has no effect on the initial rate of Cu transport. Furthermore, Western blot analyses of fractionated sf9 cell membranes show no evidence of a regulatory Cu-dependent internalization from the plasma membrane. In similar studies on human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, we showed that incubation with Cu does not alter the initial rate of Cu uptake mediated by endogenous levels of hCtr1 compared with untreated cells. Confirmation that hCtr1 mediates this transport is provided by specific small interfering RNA-dependent decreases in hCtr1 protein levels and in Cu transport rates. Western blot analysis and confocal microscopy of human embryonic kidney 293 cells showed that the majority of hCtr1 protein is localized at the plasma membrane and no significant internalization is detected upon Cu treatment. We concluded that internalization of hCtr1 is not a required step in the transport pathway; we suggest that oligomeric hCtr1 acts as a conventional transporter providing a permeation pathway for Cu through the membrane and that internalization of endogenous hCtr1 in response to elevated extracellular Cu levels does not play a significant regulatory role in Cu homeostasis.

Cu is an essential cofactor for many enzymes in eukaryotic cells, and in recent years there has been an increasing understanding of the homeostatic mechanisms that are used to regulate cellular Cu content and to deliver Cu to its required sites (1Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 2Petris M.J. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 752-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Tightly controlled homeostatic mechanisms are required as Cu is an essential metal; however, as with several other trace metals, excessive metal accumulation is severely toxic (3Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M. Biochem. J. 1984; 219: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (4577) Google Scholar, 4Fridovich I. Science. 1978; 201: 875-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (2781) Google Scholar, 5Waggoner D.J. Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. Neurobiol. Dis. 1999; 6: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Cu removal from cells is handled by the ATP7 P-type ATPases, Wilsons and Menkes disease proteins, which utilize ATP hydrolysis to deliver Cu either to the extracellular compartment or into the secretory pathway (1Lutsenko S. Petris M.J. J. Membr. Biol. 2003; 191: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 6Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The protein(s) responsible for Cu uptake has been less well characterized. A major transporter mediating Cu entry into mammalian cells is Ctr1. Ctr1 is functionally related to the Cu uptake systems first identified in yeast about 10 years ago (7Dancis A. Yuan D.S. Haile D. Askwith C. Eide D. Moehle C. Kaplan J. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 393-402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 8Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25660-25667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ctr1 apparently mediates the uptake of Cu(I) into cells (9Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It is essential for embryonic development (11Kuo Y.M. Zhou B. Cosco D. Gitschier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6836-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 12Lee J. Prohaska J.R. Thiele D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6842-6847Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and some progress has been made toward understanding its mechanism, largely through elegant complementation studies in yeast (13Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Utilizing epitope-tagged constructs, it was recently shown that Cu exposure of cells that overexpressed tagged human copper transporter 1 (hCtr1) 1The abbreviations used are: hCtr1, human copper transporter 1; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RNAi, RNA interference; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; HEK, human embryonic kidney. molecules at their surface show a rapid and complete internalization from the plasma membrane (14Petris M.J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17428-17433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). This process occurred within 10 min of exposure to Cu levels (5 μm) that were close to the Km of the transporter. It was suggested that this Cu-dependent internalization might be a part of the transport pathway, rather like the internalization of the Fe-bound transferrin receptor in the process of cellular acquisition of iron (14Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 15Guo Y. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. Petris M.J. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 364: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that such internalization resulted in degradation of hCtr1 and suggested that the internalization-degradation that was Cu-dependent might be an important regulatory pathway that limited Cu uptake under Cu-replete conditions (14Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). hCtr1 consists of 190 amino acid residues. It has an extracellular amino terminus, an intracellular carboxyl terminus, and three transmembrane segments (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17Klomp A.E. Juijn J.A. van der Gun L.T. van den Berg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 881-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the methionine-rich amino terminus plays some role in Cu coordination in a functional oligomeric complex (13Puig S. Lee J. Lau M. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26021-26030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), but details of the transport mechanism are still the subject of intensive study. During studies on the structure and function of hCtr1 expressed in sf9 insect cells using baculovirus-mediated infection, we had observed that initial rates of Cu uptake remained linear for at least 1 h in the continued presence of extracellular Cu at concentrations ranging from 2 to 25 μm (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Likewise, others have seen linear uptake for at least 1 h in HEK 293 cells overexpressing epitope-tagged hCtr1 (9Lee J. Pena M.M. Nose Y. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4380-4387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). From our studies in insect cells, it seemed unlikely that a large fraction of hCtr1 was rapidly internalized from the plasma membrane. If this had occurred, the initial rate of Cu uptake would have been expected to fall. We have reported here an investigation of this issue in stably transfected insect cells and observed no decrease in the functional activity of hCtr1 following exposure to extracellular Cu. We also extended this approach to endogenous hCtr1 in HEK 293 cells. In this human cell line we do not observe a change in transport activity of endogenous hCtr1 following incubation with Cu or a Cu-dependent internalization from the plasma membrane. hCtr1 Detection—An antibody against the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of hCtr1 was raised in rabbits by Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO. The peptide SWKKAVVVDITEHCH was synthesized and conjugated to KLH. Rabbits were immunized. The resulting antibody was affinity purified using the peptide that it was raised against. Endogenous or overexpressed hCtr1 protein was probed with the hCTR1 antibody at a dilution of 1:50,000. hCtr1 Expression in Insect Cells—hCtr1 constructs were cloned into pIB/V5-HisTOPO vector (Invitrogen). Wild type hCtr1 and C189S cDNA were PCR amplified from a baculovirus expression vector (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) using primers (5′ forward primer, 5′-gaattcatggatcattccc-3′, and 3′ reverse primer, 5′-ccgcggaacaacttcccactgc-3′) that contain EcoRI and SacII restriction sites engineered at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. C189S is a mutant of hCtr1 that has the cysteine at amino acid position 189 mutated to a serine residue and migrates primarily as a monomer, as opposed to multimeric molecules (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The amplified cDNA constructs were ligated into the pIB/V5-His-TOPO vector. The expression plasmids were sequenced to confirm the correct cDNA sequence for each construct and then were transfected into sf9 cells using Cellfectin transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). sf9 cells containing integrated hCtr1 cDNA were selected using Blasticidin S (Invitrogen) for 2 weeks. Expression of the respective hCtr1 construct was compared with baculovirus-expressed protein and confirmed by Western analysis using our anti-hCtr1 antibody. Cells were maintained in Ex-Cell 420 medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) containing 0.015 mg/ml Blasticidin S. Cu uptake into cells was measured in each of these cell lines using Cu-64, as previously reported (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). A minimum of three determinations of the rate of Cu uptake was performed for each construct or experiment. RNAi Suppression—Two methods were utilized to generate siRNA molecules to use in RNAi analysis in HEK 293 cells. The first method used oligonucleotides selected and synthesized by Invitrogen (Stealth RNAi). The second method used the Invitrogen Block-iT RNAi kit. Two Stealth RNAi oligonucleotides were tested for knockdown of endogenous hCtr1 protein. The second method involved amplification of hCtr1 and modification of this amplified product using the components of the Block-iT RNAi TOPO transcription kit and the Block-iT Dicer RNAi kit. Briefly, hCtr1 cDNA was amplified using two primers (5′-gaattcatggatcattccc-3′ and 5′-aagcttaacaacttcccactgc-3′), and T7 linkers were ligated using the TOPO ligation technology. Equal amounts of sense and antisense single-stranded RNA transcripts were annealed to generate double-stranded RNA complexes that were then cut to create 20–25-bp fragments by the Dicer enzyme. These fragments were transfected into HEK 293 cells and analyzed to determine whether gene knockdown had occurred. Transfection efficiency was monitored using a fluorescent oligonucleotide (BLOCK-iT fluorescent oligo; Invitrogen) and estimated to be 80–90%. Both sets of RNAi molecules were transfected individually into HEK 293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 following Invitrogen's protocols. The ability of the RNAi molecules to knock down hCtr1 expression was analyzed by hCtr1 protein detection using anti-hCtr1 antibody on whole cell extracts and by measuring Copper-64 transport in HEK 293 cells transfected with and without RNAi molecules. As a control for nonspecific knockdown, RNAi were generated from a Lac Z cDNA using the Block-iT RNAi kit. Cell Fractionation—Fractionation of insect cells or HEK 293 cells was carried out using a 5-step sucrose step gradient as described previously (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or using linear Optiprep gradients (Sigma). Briefly, cells were treated with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) for 20 min followed by ±100 μm CuCl2 treatment for 2 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with PBS, and resuspended in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4). Cells were lysed using a dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), and the postnuclear fraction was layered on top of a 5-ml linear gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 3 h and collected in 0.5-ml fractions by tube puncture. 30 μg of protein from each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The subsequent protein blot was analyzed using the hCtr1 antibody (1:50,000) and an horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:10,000). Immunofluorescence—HEK 293 cells were grown in 12-well trays for 24–48 h on sterile glass coverslips. In each experiment, CuCl2 (100 μm) was added to the medium of some wells for 2 h, whereas other wells containing HEK 293 cells had no extra copper added. Cells were fixed and permeabilized by the addition of ice-cold acetone followed by a PBS wash. The cells were blocked in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1% gelatin overnight. The cells were probed with a primary antibody at the stated dilution for 1 h followed by PBS washes. The cells were then probed with secondary antibodies (1:2000) for 1 h followed by PBS washes. Samples were mounted using Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Ca). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). hCtr1 Expressed in Insect Cells—We have previously shown that viral expression of hCtr1 in sf9 insect cells provides good yields of functional protein (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the present study, we developed and used two stable sf9 cell lines expressing hCtr1. Stable cell lines allow more consistent expression of hCtr1 mutant proteins by removing some of the potential variables associated with a lytic viral expression system. Two cell lines were utilized in this study, one expressing a wild type construct and the second expressing a single cysteine substitution mutant, C189S. We tested the ability of cells expressing these two constructs to transport Cu across the plasma membrane in sf9 cells. The cell line expressing the wild type transporter showed saturable Cu uptake with an apparent Km of 8.2 ± 0.8 μm and a Vmax of 84 ± 3.6 pmol Cu/mg protein/min. Similarly, C189S had an apparent Km of 6.8 ± 0.6 μm and a Vmax of 66 ± 2.3 pmol Cu/mg protein/min (data not shown). The Km values for these two constructs are similar to those reported earlier using the baculovirus-mediated expression system (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Uptake experiments were performed using a copper concentration of 5 μm assayed for 65 min. We observed linear uptake of Cu-64 in both cell lines for at least 1 h. Cu-64 uptake was 3.5-fold greater in hCtr1 cell lines than in sf9 cells not expressing hCtr1. There was no demonstrable decrease in the rate of uptake during the 65 min of measurement (Fig. 1). Recently, reports suggesting rapid internalization of hCtr1 by extracellular copper have speculated about the role of this regulation on the transport of Cu into cells (14Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It has been reported that hCtr1 is internalized at copper levels similar to the apparent Km of hCtr1 for Cu transport. This led to the suggestion that binding of Cu to hCtr1 induces internalization with Cu bound. A subsequent event occurs once the Cu-bound hCtr1 is internalized that allows Cu to be transported from inside the endosome (or some other compartment) to proteins in the cytoplasm of cells, either via hCtr1 or another as yet unidentified protein. It was postulated that this mechanism might provide the basis for Cu uptake into cells (14Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 16Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). This model for Cu transport is reminiscent of transferrin receptor-mediated uptake of iron. We have tested this proposal in insect cells expressing C189S hCtr1 and examined the impact of exposure to extracellular copper on hCtr1 proteins at the plasma membrane. C189S was selected as it is predominantly monomeric in SDS gels (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29162-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Cells stably expressing C189S were pretreated for 10 min with 100 μm CuCl2. The cells were washed with transport buffer, and the rate of uptake into these cells was compared with cells that had not been exposed to Cu. The results are shown in Fig. 1. Clearly the pre-exposure to Cu is without effect on the kinetics of Cu uptake. Internalization of a significant fraction of hCtr1 at these high Cu levels would result in a decrease in the rate of Cu uptake. Similarly, Western blot analysis of C189S cells pretreated or not with 100 μm Cu showed no significant difference in the intensity of the hCtr1 C189S protein in the plasma membrane (Fig. 1, inset). This provides strong evidence that significant internalization of hCtr1 is not a necessary step in the transport mechanism. Consequently, there is no reason to suppose that hCtr1 mediates transport by a mechanism other than a conventional transport pathway. Endogenous hCTR1 Expression in HEK 293 Cells—Previous studies that have described Cu-dependent internalization have been carried out in mammalian cells that have been engineered to overexpress an epitope-tagged version of hCtr1. We decided to extend our experiments to assess the role that internalization might play in regulation of endogenous hCtr1 levels at the plasma membrane of HEK 293 cells. Utilizing a similar strategy as we described above for insect cells, we measured the rate of isotopic Cu uptake into HEK 293 cells following their incubation in the presence of 50 μm Cu (data not shown), 100 μm Cu, or in the absence of Cu. There was no impact of Cu pretreatment on the uptake of extracellular Cu (Fig. 2) where uptake was linear for at least 80 min following Cu pretreatment, and Western blot analysis of plasma membrane fractions isolated from these two sets of cells showed no significant change in the amount of hCtr1 protein (Fig. 2, inset). To better assess the possibility of shifts of hCtr1 from the plasma membrane to internal locations within the cell, we fractionated cells on a linear gradient after cycloheximide treatment followed by 3 h of copper treatment with 100 μm CuCl2. There was no significant movement of the hCtr1 from the plasma membrane to internal fractions either in cells pretreated with 100 μm CuCl2 or cells receiving no Cu pretreatment (data not shown). One question that arises from the experiments with HEK 293 cells is whether or not the major fraction of Cu uptake measured is mediated by endogenous hCtr1 or by some other transporter (see “Discussion”). To examine this issue, we utilized an RNAi approach. We treated HEK 293 cells with specific oligonucleotides designed to reduce hCtr1 protein levels. We examined both the rate of uptake of Cu into cells following RNAi knockdown and the antibody signal reflecting protein levels of hCtr1 in the plasma membrane. There was a significant decrease in hCtr1 expression in cells that have been treated with siRNA compared with control cells (Fig. 3, inset). Similarly, there was an ∼80% decrease in the rate of Cu uptake into the treated cells. This confirms that the major fraction of the Cu uptake into HEK 293 cells is mediated by hCtr1 (Fig. 3). These experiments demonstrate that endogenous hCtr1 protein is the primary protein involved in the Cu uptake pathway into these mammalian cells. Significantly, hCtr1 is available to mediate Cu uptake in both replete and Cu-depleted extracellular conditions. We do not see any shift of endogenous hCtr1 protein from the plasma membrane nor do we see any loss of total hCtr1 protein (or significant degradation) from the cellular pools of these cells. Confocal Microscopy of Endogenous hCtr1 Cellular Protein— Recent studies investigating the cellular localization of hCtr1 using confocal microscopy have produced conflicting results. The primary location of hCtr1 protein within the cell has varied depending on which cell line was examined (14Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 16Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Most of this work has been carried out utilizing overexpressed epitopetagged protein. To complement our characterization of the functional properties of endogenous hCtr1 protein, we utilized confocal microscopy to image the hCtr1 protein pools in HEK 293 cells. Using our hCTR1 antibody (1:500), we probed the cellular location of endogenous hCtr1 in HEK 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, we saw a significant amount of antibody staining at the plasma membrane. We next examined the effects that excess Cu in the extracellular medium might have on the amount and location of endogenous hCtr1 protein. HEK 293 cells were plated on coverslips and allowed to grow until 50% confluent. The cells were then either treated with 100 μm CuCl2 or were left in medium containing no excess Cu. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 4 (top two panels). We see endogenous hCtr1 protein at the plasma membrane in both Cu-treated cells and in cells with no Cu pretreatment. It is difficult to accurately quantitate the levels of protein found at the plasma membrane, but it is clear that a significant portion remains at the plasma membrane, competent to mediate Cu uptake. To confirm that the hCtr1 staining is at the plasma membrane, we double-labeled HEK 293 cells with our hCTR1 antibody as well as with an antibody raised against the β-subunit of the Na,K ATPase (1:500). The latter protein is not sensitive to extracellular Cu concentration. As can be seen in Fig. 4, G and H, Cu pretreatment has little effect on the localization of either protein and co-localization of these two proteins occurs at the plasma membrane. The absence of a Cu-dependent decrease in the rate of Cu uptake and no loss of hCtr1 from the plasma membrane of insect cells confirm that internalization of Cu-bound transporter is not an essential step for Cu uptake mediated by hCtr1. It seems likely that hCtr1 mediates Cu uptake in a more conventional manner. We suggest that hCtr1 provides a Cu permeation pathway through the plasma membrane. There have been several studies since the first observations on the function of hCtr1 that have concluded that the 28-kDa protein probably forms oligomers in the plasma membrane (9Lee J. Pena M.M.

It seems likely that a stable oligomer of hCtr1 monomers forms in the cell membrane and that this complex mediates the uptake of Cu into the cell. It has been suggested that these oligomers are probably trimeric, although other structures, tetramers or trimers of dimers, have not been ruled out. We suggest that the important methionine-rich domains in the extracellular amino terminus (10Eisses J.F. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

We are currently investigating the details of this proposal utilizing site-directed mutagenesis and functional transport assays. The suggestion that elevated extracellular Cu might directly feed back to reduce its own cellular uptake is attractive, especially in the light of post-translational down-regulation of Cu transporters that has been observed in yeast following their internalization (20Ooi C.E. Rabinovich E. Dancis A. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3515-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The initial report of Cu-dependent internalization of epitope-tagged hCTR1 in HEK 293 cells occurred at Cu levels as low as 2 μm and was essentially complete in 10 min (14Petris M.J. Smith K. Lee J. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9639-9646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies support this observation in HEK 293 cells at elevated Cu levels of ∼50–100 μm. Although both labeling and confocal microscopic evidence was presented for these epitope-tagged constructs, it should be emphasized that no functional corollary was demonstrated. Studies in other cells (HeLa and Caco2 cells) did not observe such Cu-dependent relocalization of endogenous levels of hCTR1 (16Klomp A.E. Tops B.B. Van Denberg I.E. Berger R. Klomp L.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar); these authors conclude that these putative regulatory phenomena may be cell-specific. It should be borne in mind that although hCtr1 expression is apparently essential for embryonic development and Cu uptake is its sole known physiological function, it is not the only transporter that can mediate Cu uptake. It has been suggested that in some intestinal cells Cu uptake is mediated by the divalent metal ion transporter, DMT1 (21Arredondo M. Munoz P. Mura C.V. Nunez M.T. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C1525-C1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the present work we have shown that in HEK 293 cells, a human cell line, hCTR1, is responsible for at least 80% of the Cu uptake. It is interesting that in intestinal cells it has been reported that Cu uptake is stimulated (and not decreased) by exposure to elevated Cu levels (22Zerounian N.R. Redekosky C. Malpe R. Linder M.C.

It has yet to be shown which of the Cu uptake proteins mediates the uptake pathway in these intestinal cells. In the present work we have supplied functional (Cu uptake measurements), biochemical (cell fractionation), RNA knockdown, and confocal microscopic data that together suggest that endogenous levels of hCTR1 are stably expressed in the plasma membrane and remain functional in the face of elevated extracellular Cu. We have suggested that Cu uptake is mediated by hCTR1 by providing a transport pathway across the plasma membrane and that the regulation of cellular Cu content in the face of elevated extracellular Cu levels more likely occurs via regulation of the Cu exit pathways. Such regulation of exit pathways has previously been reported (6Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) to occur in the relocalization of ATP7A, the Menkes disease protein, from intracellular locations to the plasma membrane in response to elevated Cu levels.

The present study uses patch clamp recording to identify a pore-lining lysine residue, Lys-95, that acts to attract large blocker molecules into this inner vestibule. Mutations that remove the fixed positive charge associated with this amino acid residue dramatically weaken the blocking effects of five structurally unrelated open channel blockers (glibenclamide, 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, lonidamine, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid, and taurolithocholate-3-sulfate) when applied to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. Mutagenesis of Lys-95 also induced amino acid side chain charge-dependent rectification of the macroscopic current-voltage relationship, consistent with the fixed positive charge on this residue normally acting to attract Cl– ions from the intracellular solution into the pore. These results identify Lys-95 as playing an important role in attracting permeant anions into the channel pore inner vestibule, probably by an electrostatic mechanism.

Physiol. 2004; 124: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These structurally diverse open channel blocker molecules share an apparently similar mechanism of action characterized by entry into the channel pore exclusively or preferentially from its intracellular end in a manner that is facilitated by negative membrane voltages and impeded by Cl– ions on the opposite side of the membrane. The sidedness of action shown by these open channel blockers has led to the suggestion that the CFTR pore has a wide inner vestibule that shows little discrimination between anions, allowing electrodiffusional entry of a structurally diverse range of negatively charged molecules (19Zhou Z.

Following patch excision, CFTR channels were activated by exposure of the cytoplasmic face of the patch to the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (20 nm) plus MgATP (1 mm). Activated channels were then “locked” in the open state by the addition of 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate (11Gong X. Linsdell P. J.

Initially, both intracellular (bath) and extracellular (pipette) solutions contained 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm TES. To study the effects of open channel blockers, 150 mm sodium gluconate was substituted for NaCl in the pipette solution. All solutions were adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. Given voltages have been corrected for liquid junction potentials calculated using pCLAMP8 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).CFTR inhibitors were added to the patch clamp chamber from stock solutions made up in normal bath solution. These stocks were made fresh every 3 h and stored in the dark at 4 °C until use. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich except for the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Promega, Madison, WI). Glibenclamide, lonidamine, and 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) were initially solubilized in Me2SO. Final Me2SO concentrations in the experimental chamber were ≤ 0.1%. At this concentration Me2SO had no apparent effect on CFTR macroscopic currents, which is in agreement with prior reports from several laboratories (22Sheppard D.N. Robinson K.A. J.

Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This phenomenon was ascribed to the location of Arg-334 in the outer vestibule of the pore, where its fixed charge acts electrostatically to attract Cl– ions from the extracellular solution into the pore (13Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Conversely, removal (by mutagenesis) of another positively charged residue within the pore, Lys-95 in TM1, caused strong outward rectification of the I-V relationship (6Ge N. Muise C.N. Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55283-55289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In a striking parallel with previous findings involving Arg-334 (13Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Gong X. Linsdell P. J. Physiol. 2003; 549: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), mutagenesis of Lys-95 had a strongly charge-dependent effect on I-V rectification (Fig. 1); the charge-conservative K95R, like wild type CFTR, showed a practically linear I-V relationship, whereas all of the other mutations, and especially the charge-reversing K95E, caused significant outward rectification. Although all of the results shown in Fig. 1 come from currents recorded after locking the channels open with PPi, identical rectification was observed prior to PPi treatment in all cases (data not shown), indicating that current rectification is not the result of voltage-dependent channel gating. Consideration of the overall net charge at these two amino acid positions (95 and 334) yields a continuum of the I-V relationship shape (Fig. 1C), which is consistent with these two positively charged residues playing analogous roles in attracting intracellular and extracellular Cl– ions, respectively, into the channel pore.Interaction of Open Channel Blockers with Lys-95—Because Lys-95 appears to play a role in attracting intracellular Cl– ions into the CFTR channel pore, I next addressed whether this positively charged residue is also involved in attracting large intracellular anions into the putative inner pore vestibule. As shown in Fig. 2, inhibition of macroscopic CFTR current by glibenclamide, a potent intracellular open channel blocker, was greatly weakened in K95Q as compared with wild type. Consistent with previous reports (19Zhou Z. Hu S. Hwang T.-C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 647-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Sheppard D.N. Robinson K.A. J.

Physiol. 1996; 271: L192-L200PubMed Google Scholar), intracellular glibenclamide blocked wild type CFTR in a voltage-dependent manner, with a Kd of 12.6 μm at –100 mV (Fig. 2, B and C) and an nH of between 0.91 and 1.11 at different voltages. In K95Q, the Kd at this voltage was increased to 107 μm, an increase of ∼8.5-fold. Furthermore, glibenclamide block of K95Q appeared only weakly dependent on voltage (Fig. 2C). Thus, the positively charged side chain of Lys-95 appears to be important in attracting negatively charged glibenclamide molecules into the channel pore, particularly at negative voltages that facilitate glibenclamide movement into the pore and across part of the transmembrane electric field.To investigate the role played by Lys-95 in attracting glibenclamide molecules into the pore, glibenclamide inhibition of other CFTR mutants was examined (Fig. 3). These results, using a number of different amino acid substitutions of Lys-95, strongly suggest that side chain charge at this position is important in controlling the apparent affinity of glibenclamide block; the apparent Kd at –100 mV was not affected in the charge-conservative K95R but was significantly increased in charge-neutralizing mutants (K95A, K95C, K95Q) and most strongly increased in the charge-reversing K95E mutant. Whereas it is likely that introduction of a negatively charged amino acid side chain at any point along the permeation pathway could impede the entry of negatively charged substances such as glibenclamide, the results with mutants in which the positive charge is removed are consistent with Lys-95 normally playing an electrostatic role in attracting anionic substances such as glibenclamide into the channel pore from its intracellular end.Fig. 3Glibenclamide affinity is dependent on amino acid side chain charge. Mean glibenclamide affinity (Kd) at –100 mV in different channel variants was estimated as described in the Fig. 2 legend. Values are means of data from 3–5 patches. Asterisks indicate a significant difference from wild type (WT) (p < 0.05). Because of low current expression in baby hamster kidney cell membrane patches, K95M was not included in this analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The blocking effects of other structurally unrelated open channel blockers on wild type and K95Q-CFTR are compared in Fig. 4. Four well characterized anionic CFTR open channel blockers from different chemical families were chosen, namely the disulfonic stilbene 4,4′-dinitrostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (27Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. J. Physiol. 1996; 496: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the indazole lonidamine (18Gong X. Burbridge S.M. Lewis A.C. Wong P.Y.D. Linsdell P. Brit. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 928-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the arylaminobenzoate NPPB (25Zhang Z.-R. Zeltwanger S. McCarty N.A. J. Membr. Biol. 2000; 175: 35-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 31Walsh K.B. Long K.J. Shen X. Brit. J.

Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, all of these substances caused potent, voltage-dependent inhibition of wild type CFTR currents when added to the intracellular solution. In contrast, at the same concentrations each of these substances had only weak inhibitory effects on K95Q-CFTR. Indeed, a simplistic quantitative analysis of the blocking effects of these substances at the single concentration studied (see “Experimental Procedures”) suggested that the Kd at –100 mV was increased by a factor of at least 25-fold in each case. Although this provides a rough approximation only, particularly as the estimated Kd was far greater than the concentration of blocker actually used in the case of K95Q, it does suggest that the blocking effects of each of these substances is in fact considerably more sensitive to mutagenesis of Lys-95 than are the blocking effects of glibenclamide. Thus Lys-95 appears to play a central role in conferring sensitivity to these open channel blockers on the CFTR pore.Fig. 4Mutagenesis of Lys-95 weakens the inhibitory effects of structurally diverse open channel blockers.A, example leak-subtracted current-voltage relationships for wild type and K95Q-CFTR following maximal channel activation with the protein kinase A catalytic subunit and PPi.

The proposed function of Lys-95 is shown in schematic form in Fig. 5. The fixed positive charge of the lysine side chain attracts Cl– ions from the intracellular solution into an inner vestibule of the channel pore (Fig. 5A). This role is directly analogous to that suggested previously for another fixed positive charge, that of the arginine side chain of Arg-334, in attracting extracellular Cl– ions into an outer pore vestibule (13Smith S.S. Liu X. Zhang Z.-R. Sun F. Kriewall T.E. McCarty N.A. Dawson D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 407-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). Removal of the fixed charge at position 95 reduces anion entry from the intracellular solution, leading to diminished anion efflux and an outwardly rectified current-voltage relationship, whereas removal of the positive charge at position 334 reduces anion entry from the extracellular solution and causes inward rectification. The analogous roles of these two positively charged amino acid side chains is supported by the continuum"

DNA helicases are involved in essentially all the metabolic pathways that entail melting of the DNA double helix, such as DNA replication, homologous recombination (HR), 1The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); RPA, replication protein A.1The abbreviations used are: HR, homologous recombination; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; AMP-PCP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-methylenetriphosphate); AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imino)triphosphate; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); RPA, replication protein A. and DNA repair reactions (1Opresko P.L.

Res. 2002; 509: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These enzymes invariably possess the ability to hydrolyze a nucleoside triphosphate (most often ATP) when DNA (in general ssDNA) is present, and they are capable of utilizing the free energy derived from the nucleotide hydrolytic reaction to translocate on the DNA. Upon encountering a duplex region, the base pairing in the DNA is disrupted to result in the separation of DNA strands. Certain DNA helicase enzymes, e.g. those that belong to the RecQ helicase family, are specific for DNA structures that arise during homologous recombination and when replication forks stall (1Opresko P.L.

Res. 2002; 509: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the translocase activity of some helicases enables them to dislodge proteins from their path of movement, and this property of the helicase enzymes in question is believed to be germane for their biological roles (3Kaplan D.L.

A number of DNA helicases, including the yeast Srs2 and Sgs1 proteins and the human BLM and WRN proteins, play roles in modulating homologous recombination efficiency and outcome, preventing replication fork demise, and the general maintenance of the genome (1Opresko P.L. Cheng W.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18099-18102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Wu L. Hickson I.D. Mutat.

In humans, inactivation of the BLM and WRN helicases can lead to Bloom syndrome and Werner syndrome, which are marked by cancer predisposition. These findings aptly underscore the importance for delineating the functions of DNA helicases in homologous recombination and related processes. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae MPH1-encoded product, a nuclear protein that possesses sequence homology to the superfamily 2 class of helicase enzymes, has been implicated in an HR-dependent pathway of mutation avoidance (8Entian K.D. Schuster T. Hegemann J.H. Becher D. Feldmann H. Guldener U. Gotz R. Hansen M. Hollenberg C.P. Jansen G. Kramer W. Klein S. Kotter P. Kricke J. Launhardt H. Mannhaupt G. Maierl A. Meyer P. Mewes W.

A deletion mutant of the MPH1 gene was first identified to be a spontaneous mutator (8Entian K.D. Schuster T. Hegemann J.H. Becher D. Feldmann H. Guldener U. Gotz R. Hansen M. Hollenberg C.P. Jansen G. Kramer W. Klein S. Kotter P. Kricke J. Launhardt H. Mannhaupt G. Maierl A. Meyer P. Mewes W. Munder T. Niedenthal R.K. Ramezani Rad M. Rohmer A. Romer A. Hinnen A. et al.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 683-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In mph1Δ cells, forward mutations at the CAN1 locus and the reversion of trp1-289 harboring an amber mutation are both enhanced. However, frameshift mutations, as gauged by analyzing the mutation spectrum at the URA3 locus and measuring the reversion of hom3-10, are not elevated (9Scheller J. Schurer A. Rudolph C. Hettwer S. Kramer W. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional analyses involving a rev3 mutation, which inactivates the error prone DNA polymerase ζ, revealed that the genetic mutations that accumulate in mph1Δ cells arise from the error-prone bypass of spontaneous DNA lesions by this polymerase. Cells lacking Mph1 are also hypersensitive to the genotoxic agents ethyl methanesulfonate, methyl methanesulfonate, and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and slightly so to camptothecin (9Scheller J. Schurer A. Rudolph C. Hettwer S. Kramer W. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA damage sensitivity and mutator phenotype of the mph1Δ mutant are epistatic to mutations in genes that belong to the RAD52 epistasis group required for HR, the homology-directed repair of damaged DNA, and the restart of stalled DNA replication forks. Even though the mph1Δ mutation does not impair spontaneous mitotic heteroallelic recombination and in fact elevates spontaneous allelic recombination frequency in a sgs1Δ background (10Schurer K.A. Rudolph C. Ulrich H.D. Kramer W. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1673-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), unequal sister chromatid recombination events are compromised. 2K. Anke Schürer and W. Kramer, unpublished data..2K. Anke Schürer and W. Kramer, unpublished data.. Taken together, the available genetic data are consistent with the premise that Mph1 protein functions to channel DNA lesions or DNA intermediates that are associated with damaged replication forks into HR or that it is involved in the resolution of such DNA intermediates by HR. As part of our overall effort at delineating the mechanism of HR pathways, we would like to define the biochemical properties of the Mph1 protein and its interactions with proteins of the RAD52 epistasis group. Toward this goal, we have overexpressed Mph1 in yeast, devised a procedure for its purification to near homogeneity, and carried out initial biochemical characterization of the purified protein to show that it has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities. Candidate orthologues of Mph1 are present in other eukaryotes including humans. The availability of purified Mph1 and the demonstration of its catalytic activities should facilitate future efforts aimed at deciphering the role of this factor and its orthologues in homologous recombination and mutation avoidance. Expression and Purification of Mph1 Protein—The MPH1 gene, containing an epitope of the Sendai virus L-protein (DGSLGDIEPYDSS (11Einberger H. Mertz R. Hofschneider P.H. Neubert W.J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4274-4280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) and also a His6 affinity tag, was cloned as an SmaI/EcoRI fragment into the Ecl136II/EcoRI sites of pYES2 (Invitrogen) containing the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter to yield pYES2-Mph1 (2μ, URA3, GAL1-MPH1). This Mph1 expression plasmid was introduced into the protease-deficient strain BJ5464 (MATα ura3-52 trp1 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1 GAL). Overnight cultures grown at 30 °C in complete synthetic media lacking uracil were diluted 8-fold into fresh medium containing galactose and incubated at 30 °C for 18 h to induce the expression of Mph1. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at –80 °C. All the subsequent steps were carried out at 4 °C. To prepare cell extract, 200 g of yeast paste was thawed in 350 ml of cell breakage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 10% sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitors aprotinin, chymostatin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A (each at 5 μg/ml)) and passed through a French press to disrupt cells. The crude extract was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g for 90 min), and the supernatant was diluted with K buffer (20 mm KH2PO4, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) to a conductivity equivalent to 150 mm KCl. This protein solution was passed through a 30-ml column of Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and the flow-through fraction was applied to a 30-ml SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) and was developed with a 300-ml gradient of 150–550 mm KCl in K buffer. As identified by immunoblotting with anti-histidine antibodies and staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels with Coomassie Blue, Mph1 eluted from the SP column at ∼350 mm KCl. The peak fractions were mixed with 2 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads with 20 ml of buffer K containing 150 mm KCl and 20 mm imidazole, Mph1 was eluted with K buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The protein-containing fractions were applied onto a 1-ml Source Q column (Amersham Biosciences), which was developed with a 20-ml gradient of 100–400 mm KCl in K buffer, with Mph1 eluting at ∼240 mm KCl. The peak fractions were pooled and fractionated on a 0.5-ml Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences) using a 10-ml gradient of 150–650 mm KCl in K buffer. Mph1 eluted from the Mono S column at ∼350 mm KCl and was concentrated to 80 μl in a Centricon-30 (Millipore). The concentrated Mph1 protein was stored in small aliquots at –80 °C. To establish the identity of the purified protein, it was subject to MALDI-TOF analysis in the W. M. Keck Biomedical Spectrometry Laboratory at the University of Virginia Health System. This analysis confirmed that the purified protein was Mph1. Purification of RPA—The heterotrimeric ssDNA binding factor RPA was purified to near homogeneity from Escherichia coli cells tailored to co-express the three subunits as described (12Sung P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1111-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). DNAs and DNA Helicase Substrates—The ϕX174 replicative form I DNA was purchased from Invitrogen, and the viral (+) strand was from New England Biolabs. Linearized replicative form I DNA was prepared by digestion with ApaLI. The oligonucleotides used in this study are summarized in Table I (Invitrogen). Selected oligonucleotides were 5′ end-labeled with [γ32-P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The following substrates were constructed from the oligonucleotides; (i) radiolabeled H1 was hybridized to unlabeled H3 to obtain a substrate with a 40-base pair duplex region and 40-nucleotide 3′ ssDNA overhang, (ii) radiolabeled H1 was hybridized to unlabeled H4 to obtain a partial duplex with a 40-base pair duplex region and a 40-nucleotide 5′ ssDNA overhang, and (iii) radiolabeled A2 was hybridized to unlabeled A1 to yield a partial duplex with a 100-base pair duplex region and a 50-nucleotide 3′ ssDNA overhang. The DNA hybridization reactions were conducted by heating equimolar amounts of the indicated oligonucleotide pairs at 95 °C for 10 min in buffer H (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) followed by slow cooling to room temperature. Hybridized DNA substrates were separated from un-annealed oligonucleotides in 12% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels run in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA) and were recovered from the gel by electroelution in dialysis tubing in TAE buffer.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides used in this studyName of the oligonucleotideDNA sequence (5′ to 3′)5-merACAGC8-merACAGCACC12-merACAGCACCAGAT16-merACAGCACCAGATTCAG20-merCCTTCAGTGAACCTCTACCC30-merAAAAGAATTCAGGTACGCTCCAGAAACTACAAAAG40-merGGATATGGATCCCTACTTATTGTACGTTACAGCCGGTAAG60-merAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGGTCGACTCTAGAGGATCCCCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAATTCGTAA90-merAAATCAATCTAAAGTATATATGAGTAAACTTGGTCTGACAGTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGAGGCACCTATCTCAGCGATCTGTCTATTTH1ATTAAGCTCTAAGCCATGAATTCAAATGACCTCTTATCAAH3TTGATAAGAGGTCATTTGAATTCATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATTGCTGAATCTGGTGCTGGGATCCAACATGTTTTAAATATGH4ATGTCACTATTGAAGCGCTGATCACTGTCTCCATCGAACGTTGATAAGAGGTCATTTGAATTCATGGCTTAGAGCTTAATA1GAGTTTTATCGCTTCCATGACGCAGAAGTTAACACTTTCGGATATTTCTGATGAGTCGAAAAATTATCTTGATAAAGCAGGAATTACTACTGCTTGTTTAATTCGCGGTAGGGTACTTCTACAGCTGATTTGATTAGTAGACGTGATCGGA2TAAACAAGCAGTAGTAATTCCTGCTTTATCAAGATAATTTTTCGACTCATCAGAAATATCCGAAAGTGTTAACTTCTGCGTCATGGAAGCGATAAAACTCP1GAGTTTTATCGCTTCCATGACGCAGAAGP3CAGAAAATCGAAATCATCTTCGGTTAAATC Open table in a new tab ATPase Assay—Unless stated otherwise, Mph1 (35 nm) was mixed with the DNA cofactor (25 μm nucleotides or base pairs) in 10 μl of buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) containing the indicated amounts of KCl. Unless stated otherwise, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C, and at the indicated times a 2-μl aliquot was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 500 mm EDTA to halt the hydrolysis reaction. The released radiolabeled phosphate was separated from the unhydrolyzed radiolabeled ATP by thin layer chromatography in polyethyleneimine cellulose sheets (13Petukhova G. Stratton S. Sung P. Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), and the level of these radiolabeled species was determined by phosphorimaging analysis of the chromatography sheets in a Personal Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). DNA Helicase Assay—Mph1 was incubated at 30 °C with the helicase substrates (300 nm nucleotides) in 10 μl of buffer D (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). RPA (500 nm) was added to some of the reactions. Aliquots (5 μl) of the reactions were drawn at the indicated times and treated with SDS (0.2% final) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) at 30 °C for 1 min. The released 32P-labeled DNA fragment was separated from the substrate in 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in TAE buffer at 23 °C. The gels were dried onto Whatman DE81 paper (Whatman International Limited) and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Mph1 Overexpression and Purification—For protein purification we attached a carboxyl-terminal His6 epitope to the MPH1-coding sequence and then placed the tagged gene under the galactose inducible GAL1 promoter in the vector pYES. The resulting plasmid, pYES-Mph1 (2μ, URA3, GAL1-MPH1), and the empty vector pYES were introduced into the protease-deficient yeast strain BJ5464. Plasmid-bearing strains were grown in the presence of galactose to induce the GAL1 promoter. When analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-histidine antibodies, lysates prepared from cells harboring pYES-Mph1 showed an immunoreactive band of 130 kDa that was absent in the control cell lysates (Fig. 1A). The observed size of the tagged Mph1 protein in the immunoblot analysis is in exact agreement with the predicted value of 130 kDa. A chromatographic procedure that entails fractionation of extracts on Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose, nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, Source Q, and Mono S was devised (Fig. 1B) to purify the tagged Mph1 protein to near homogeneity (Fig. 1C). Results from a MALDI-TOF analysis of the purified protein helped verify that it was tagged Mph1. The overall yield of Mph1 was 300 μg from 200 g of yeast cell paste. Three separate His6-tagged Mph1 preparations gave very similar results in all of the biochemical assays described below. Mph1 Has ssDNA-dependent ATPase Activity—The presence of Walker nucleotide binding motifs that could potentially endow Mph1 with the ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP prompted us to examine the purified Mph1 protein for ATPase activity. The ATPase assays were carried out in the absence of DNA or in the presence of ϕX174 replicative form I DNA, linear duplex, or viral (+) strand DNA. As shown in Fig. 2A, whereas little or no ATP hydrolysis occurred in the absence of DNA and with the replicative form I DNA or linear duplex, robust ATPase activity was seen with the viral (+) strand DNA. These results indicate that Mph1 has an ATP hydrolytic function that is dependent on ssDNA for activation. Even though oligonucleotides can also serve as a co-factor for ATP hydrolysis by Mph1 (see “Discussion”), poly(dT) was ineffective in this regard. Whether the absence of ATP hydrolysis with poly(dT) is due to a lack of binding of this polynucleotide by Mph1 or to another reason remains to be determined. When measured at 30 °C, pH 7.5, 15 mm KCl, 2.5 mm Mg2+, and with the ϕX174 viral (+) strand as the DNA cofactor, the kcat of ATP hydrolysis was calculated to be ∼1500 min–1. The ATPase activity observed is intrinsic to Mph1 because (i) our Mph1 preparations were highly purified (Fig. 1C) and (ii) this activity co-eluted with the Mph1 protein during the last step of protein purification in Mono S (Fig. 2B). Next, we examined how the Mph1 ATPase activity is influenced by various biochemical parameters. As shown in Fig. 3A, there was a slight increase in the ATP hydrolysis rate by elevating the incubation temperature from 23 °C. The ATPase activity of Mph1 is somewhat salt-sensitive, such that ∼30% inhibition of the activity occurred when the KCl concentration was increased from 15 to 200 mm (Fig. 3B). The optimal pH for ATP hydrolysis resides within the range of ∼6.6–8.4 (Fig. 3C). In terms of metal requirement, maximal activity was obtained with Mg2+, whereas Co2+ and Ca2+ are much less effective in this regard, and no activity was observed with Mn2+ or Zn2+ (Fig. 3D). The optimal concentration of Mg2+ was 2.5 mm. Minimal DNA Size Needed for the Activation of ATP Hydrolysis—We investigated the minimal length of ssDNA required for activation of the Mph1 ATPase activity. For this purpose we compared oligonucleotides ranging from 5 to 90 nucleotides in length for the ability to support ATP hydrolysis by Mph1 while keeping the overall concentration (in terms of the molar amount of total nucleotides) of the various DNA species the same. The results from this series of experiments are summarized in Fig. 4. Little or no ATP hydrolysis was observed until the length of the oligonucleotide reached 20 residues (Fig. 4A). Although lengthening the oligonucleotide to 30 residues resulted in only a slight elevation of ATP hydrolysis, a disproportionately large increase in ATPase activity was seen when the DNA length reached 40 residues (Fig. 4B). However, further increasing the DNA length from 40 to 60 or 90 nucleotides had only a minor stimulatory effect on ATP hydrolysis. The 60-mer substrate is as effective as ϕX viral (+) strand (5.4 kilobases in length) as a cofactor of ATP hydrolysis. Mph1 Possesses DNA Helicase Activity—Because Mph1 is related in sequence to the members of the superfamily 2 helicase family, we wished to test for helicase activity in the purified Mph1 protein. For this, we prepared 32P-labeled substrates that contained a 40-bp duplex and a 40-nucleotide 3′ or 5′ single-stranded overhang, a ssDNA length sufficient for optimal activation of the Mph1 ATPase function (Fig. 4B). Unwinding of the helicase substrates is indicated by the release of the radiolabeled 40-nucleotide fragment, which is resolved from the substrate by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel and then visualized by phosphorimaging analysis of the dried gel. We carried out the helicase assays under reaction conditions that give optimal ATPase activity (see Fig. 3). Displacement of the hybridized 32P-labeled fragment was observed only when the substrate with the 3′ single-stranded overhang was used. The amount of substrate unwound increased with the incubation time (Fig. 5, A and B) and was proportional to the concentration of Mph1 protein (Fig. 5C). As expected, when chromatographic fractions from the last step of purification in Mono S were examined for DNA unwinding activity, the level of this activity coincided with the amount of Mph1 protein in these fractions (data not shown). Thus, the results unveiled a 3′ to 5′ DNA helicase activity in Mph1. DNA Unwinding Requires ATP Hydrolysis—We wished to establish that the DNA unwinding function of Mph1 is fueled by ATP hydrolysis. As shown in Fig. 6A, no unwinding of the 3′ substrate was seen when ATP was omitted or substituted with ADP or the non-hydrolyzable (or slowly hydrolyzable) ATP analogues AMP-PNP, AMP-PCP, and ATPγS. The lack of DNA unwinding in the presence of these ATP analogues could have been due to an inability of Mph1 to recognize these nucleotides. To help eliminate this caveat, we examined the ability of the three analogues to inhibit the ATPase activity of Mph1. In these assays, the [γ-32P]ATP concentration was at 0.1 mm, whereas the concentration of the three analogues was at either 0.5 or 2 mm. The results, as presented in Fig. 6B, showed that the amount of 32P-labeled ATP hydrolyzed by Mph1 was reduced by all these nucleotides, with the most pronounced inhibition seen with ATPγS. For instance, at 0.5 and 2 mm of ATPγS, the hydrolysis of ATP was reduced by 65 and 80%, respectively. These results indicate that Mph1 binds ATPγS well and the other two analogues moderately well, and they further verify that DNA unwinding by Mph1 requires hydrolysis of the bound nucleotide. The results in Fig. 6C reveal that DNA unwinding by Mph1, like ATP hydrolysis, requires Mg2+, with Ca2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ being ineffective in this regard. Effect of RPA on Mph1-mediated DNA Unwinding—The helicase substrate used above contains a 40-bp duplex region. We asked whether a substrate that harbors a longer duplex region is also unwound by Mph1. For this purpose we made a 32P-labeled partial duplex that contains a 100-bp duplex region and a 50-nucleotide 3′ single-stranded overhang. As shown in Fig. 7A, as much as 100 nm Mph1 unwound only ∼5% of the substrate after 5 min of incubation. To help minimize possible re-annealing of separated DNA strands behind the translocating Mph1 helicase, we added the heterotrimeric ssDNA binding factor RPA to the reaction. Importantly, the presence of RPA significantly enhanced the unwinding ability of Mph1, such that ∼25% of the substrate had been dissociated by 50 nm Mph1 after 5 min of incubation (Fig. 7, B and C). To determine whether Mph1 is capable of unwinding an even longer duplex region, we prepared another helicase substrate consisting of a 32P-labeled 500-base DNA fragment hybridized to the ϕX174 viral (+) strand (14Van Komen S. Reddy M.S. Krejci L. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44331-44337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The substrate was incubated with increasing amounts of Mph1 with or without a quantity of RPA that would be sufficient to sequester the free ssDNA present in the substrate and generated as a result of DNA strand separation. However, over a wide range of Mph1 concentrations and under a variety of reaction conditions tried, little or no dissociation of this long helicase substrate occurred (data not shown). Mph1 Protein Is a 3′ to 5′ DNA Helicase—In this study we have overexpressed the MPH1-encoded product as a His6-tagged protein in yeast and have devised a simple method for its purification to near homogeneity. We established the identity of the Mph1 protein by immunoblot analysis with anti-histidine antibodies and mass spectrometry. Because the Mph1 protein exhibits homology to helicase enzymes of the superfamily 2 (9Scheller J. Schurer A. Rudolph C. Hettwer S. Kramer W. Genetics. 2000; 155: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined our purified Mph1 preparations for the ability to hydrolyze ATP and unwind DNA. The results showed a robust ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity in Mph1 and also an ability of Mph1 to unwind partially duplex DNA substrates. These enzymatic activities co-eluted with the Mph1 protein during the last step of purification in Mono S, thus helping establish that the activities are intrinsic to Mph1. The maximal activation of the ATP hydrolytic function requires a relatively long stretch of ssDNA such that a length increase from 30 to 40 nucleotides resulted in greater than a 3-fold elevation of ATP hydrolysis. Whether this reflects a large ssDNA binding site size for Mph1 or another reason remains to be determined. The polarity of DNA unwinding is 3′ to 5′ with respect to the strand on which Mph1 translocates, and as expected, the unwinding reaction is coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP. Although Mph1 is perfectly capable of dissociating a 40-bp duplex region without the aid of another protein factor, significant unwinding of a 100-bp duplex is contingent upon the addition of the heterotrimeric ssDNA binding factor RPA. The role of RPA in the Mph1-mediated DNA unwinding is likely to prevent DNA reannealing by sequestering single strands of DNA produced as a result of strand separation by Mph1. However, Mph1, even with RPA present, cannot completely unwind a 500-bp duplex region. Role of the Mph1 Helicase in Homologous Recombination and Mutation Avoidance—The mph1Δ mutant shows a spontaneous mutator phenotype and also sensitivity to a variety of DNA damaging agents, and both of these phenotypic manifestations are epistatic to mutations in the RAD51, RAD52, and RAD55 genes (10Schurer K.A. Rudolph C. Ulrich H.D. Kramer W. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1673-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), members of the RAD52 epistasis group required for chromosome repair and maintenance via HR. The mph1Δ mutant shows hyperrecombination between heteroalleles in the sgs1Δ background (10Schurer K.A. Rudolph C. Ulrich H.D. Kramer W. Genetics. 2004; 166: 1673-1686Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) but appears to be impaired in sister chromatid-based HR-mediated rescue of damaged replication forks caused by the treatment of cells with the UV mimetic 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide and the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin.2 It seems possible that Mph1 protein functions to stabilize or process the DNA intermediates that are produced during HR-mediated replication fork rescue and restart. Alternatively or in addition, Mph1 could be involved in the DNA synthesis step of HR-mediated replication fork rescue, and in this regard, the apparently modest processivity of the Mph1 helicase activity would be sufficient for the relatively short new DNA segment that needs to be synthesized. Like Mph1, several other eukaryotic DNA helicases, including the Srs2 and Sgs1 helicases in S. cerevisiae and the BLM and WRN helicases in humans, have been found to exert an important influence on the efficiency of HR reactions and/or the outcome of these reactions. In S. cerevisiae, mutational inactivation of the SRS2 gene, which encodes a member of the SF1 helicase family, results in a spontaneous hyperrecombination phenotype and other phenotypic changes because of the deregulation of HR, thus indicative of an anti-recombinase function in the Srs2 protein (5Veaute X.

Genetics. 1991; 127: 75-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the functional interactions between the Rad51 recombinase and purified Srs2 has revealed a robust ability in this helicase protein to disrupt the Rad51-ssDNA nucleoprotein filament, a critical catalytic intermediate in HR reactions (18Sung P. Krejci L. Van Komen S. Sehorn M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42729-42732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), thereby providing a biochemical explanation for its anti-recombinase activity (5Veaute X. Jeusset J. Soustelle C. Kowalczykowski S.C. Le Cam E. Fabre F. Nature. 2003; 423: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 6Krejci L. Van Komen S. Li Y. Villemain J. Reddy M.S. Klein H. Ellenberger T. Sung P. Nature. 2003; 423: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Because the mph1Δ mutation elevates allelic recombination in the sgs1Δ background, it remains possible that Mph1 protein also acts in a manner similar to Srs2 in destabilizing nucleoprotein filaments of Rad51 and ssDNA. In addition to its anti-recombinase function, Srs2 also positively influences the repair of double-strand breaks by the synthesis-dependent single-strand annealing sub-pathway of HR. Whether or not Mph1 also affects the efficiency of double-strand break repair via synthesis-dependent single-strand annealing will be a subject of our future investigations. In genetic and biochemical studies, the Sgs1 helicase and human BLM helicases appear to work in conjunction with topoisomerase III to suppress the formation of crossover recombinants by resolving the Holliday intermediate in a non-crossover fashion (19Ira G. Malkova A. Liberi G. Foiani M. Haber J.E. Cell. 2003; 115: 401-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 20Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nature. 2003; 426: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), and the WRN helicase appears to be important for processing recombination intermediates possibly including the Holliday structure (21Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It will be of interest to determine whether or not Mph1 interacts with topoisomerase III and resolves specific DNA structures that arise during HR reactions as well. The development of an expression system and purification protocol for Mph1 as well as the characterization of the ATPase and helicase activities of Mph1 should provide valuable material and basal information for defining its biochemical properties and interactions with other protein factors that function in the formation and resolution of HR intermediates. Because an apparent orthologue of MPH1 exists in humans, our continuing studies with S. cerevisiae Mph1 should complement efforts on the human counterpart."

The transcription start site of the PN promoter running the expression of the bzd catabolic genes was identified. Gel retardation assays and PN::lacZ translational fusion experiments performed both in Azoarcus sp.

This is the first report of a transcriptional repressor and a CoA-derived aromatic inducer controlling gene expression in the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds. DNase I footprinting experiments revealed that BzdR protected three regions (operators) at the PN promoter. The three operators contain direct repetitions of a TGCA sequence that forms part of longer palindromic structures. In agreement with the repressor role of BzdR, operator region I spans the transcription initiation site as well as the -10 sequence for recognition of the RNA polymerase.

In the last 3 decades, some insights have been added to the knowledge of the anaerobic catabolism of aromatic acids. Most of the studies have focused on the biochemical steps that lead to the mineralization of the aromatic ring in a few microorganisms such as certain strains of Rhodopseudomonas (photosynthetic α-Proteobacteria), Thauera, and Azoarcus (denitrifying β-Proteobacteria), in some Fe(III) and sulfate reducers, and in fermentative bacteria (1Harwood C.S.

Herrmann H. Fuchs G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 439-458Crossref Google Scholar). A general strategy used by microbes to degrade anaerobically benzoate is its activation to benzoyl-CoA that is then degraded to central biosynthetic intermediates through a series of reactions that involve aromatic ring reduction, β-oxidation-like reactions, and ring cleavage as main steps. Biochemical and genetic insights on benzoate degradation have been reported in Rhodopseudomonas palustris, Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum MS-1, Thauera aromatica, Azoarcus evansii, and Azoarcus sp. CIB (1Harwood C.S. Burchhardt G. Herrmann H. Fuchs G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 22: 439-458Crossref Google Scholar, 2Barragán M.J.L. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L.

Despite some progress on the enzymology of anaerobic catabolism of benzoate by these bacteria in recent years, very little is known about the regulation of the genes involved in this particular catabolic process. Although several genes have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of the anaerobic benzoate degradation, so far only badR and aadR have been shown to control the expression of a benzoate catabolic cluster in R. palustris (6Egland P.G. Harwood C.S. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 100-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 7Egland P.G. Harwood C.S. J.

The bzd catabolic genes are organized in a single operon (bzdNOPQMSTUVWXYZA) encoding the enzymes that activate, dearomatize, and cleave the aromatic ring of benzoate yielding CoA derivative molecules that are channeled into the central metabolism of the cell (2Barragán M.J.L.

The bzd catabolic operon is driven by the PN promoter (Fig. 1A). Upstream of the bzd operon is located the bzdR gene that is expressed from the PR promoter (Fig. 1A) (2Barragán M.J.L. Carmona M.

It has been suggested previously that the bzdR gene might encode the specific transcriptional regulator (BzdR) of the bzd cluster (2Barragán M.J.L. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5762-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).By using different genetic and biochemical approaches, we show in this work that bzdR codes for a specific regulator of the bzd catabolic genes, being the first example of a benzoyl-CoA-dependent transcriptional repressor that is described in anaerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds. Moreover, primary sequence analyses and three-dimensional modeling of BzdR reveal an unusual modular structure that allows us to consider BzdR as the first member of a new subfamily of transcriptional regulators.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Plasmids, and Growth Conditions—The Escherichia coli and Azoarcus strains as well as the plasmids used in this work are listed in Table I. To construct plasmid pCK01BzdR, a 1.6-kb EcoRI/BamHI DNA fragment containing the bzdR gene was PCR-amplified from plasmid pECOR7 (Table I) by using oligonucleotides 5R (5′-GGAATTCAGGTTCATTCGGCAGCGAGACA-3′; an engineered EcoRI site is underlined) and 3R (5′-GCGGATCCTTCGACATACTCGGCCCGAGCGGTATCTAC-3′; an engineered BamHI is underlined); the resulting fragments were then cloned into EcoRI/BamHI double-digested pCK01 plasmid (Table I). Plasmid pQE32-His6BzdR was constructed by cloning into double-digested pQE32 plasmid a 1-kb BamHI/HindIII fragment harboring the bzdR gene that was PCR-amplified from the pECOR7 plasmid by using oligonucleotides 5HISReg (5′-CGGGATCCTTTCCAACGATGAGAACTCATCAC-3′; an engineered BamHI is underlined) and 3HISReg (5′-GGGAAGCTTTCAGCGTGCCAGGACTTCGAGG-3′; an engineered HindIII is underlined). Unless indicated otherwise, E. coli cells were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (15Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). When required, E. coli cells were grown anaerobically in M63 minimal medium (15Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) at 30 °C using the corresponding necessary nutritional supplements and 20 mm glycerol, as carbon source, and 10 mm nitrate, as terminal electron acceptor. Azoarcus strains were grown anaerobically in MC medium as described previously (2Barragán M.J.L. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L. Díaz E. J.

Plasmid DNA was prepared with a High Pure plasmid isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). DNA fragments were purified with Gene-Clean Turbo (Q-BIOgene). Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Oligo-1000 M nucleotide synthesizer (Beckman Instruments, Inc.). All cloned inserts and DNA fragments were confirmed by DNA sequencing through an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Transformation of E. coli cells was carried out by using the RbCl method or by electroporation (Gene Pulser; Bio-Rad) (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).

Thus, a 598-bp DNA fragment spanning from the 3′-end of the bzdR gene to the translation start codon of the bzdN gene was PCR-amplified using plasmid pECOR7 (Table I) as template and oligonucleotides 3REG (5′-GGGGTACCCGTGCATCAATGATCCGGCAAG-3′; an engineered KpnI site is underlined) and 5BZN (5′-GCTCTAGACCCATCGAACTATCTCCTCTGATG-3′; the bzdN start codon is indicated in boldface type, and an engineered XbaI site is underlined) (2Barragán M.J.L. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5762-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a 2070-bp DNA fragment spanning from the 5′-end of the bzdR gene to the translation start codon of bzdN was PCR-amplified using plasmid pECOR7 as template and oligonucleotides 5REG (5′-GGGGTACCGGTTTCGTCGCAGGTGCTGTCTGGC-3′; an engineered KpnI site is underlined) and 5BZN. The PCR-amplified fragments were digested with KpnI and XbaI restriction endonucleases and ligated to the KpnI/XbaI double-digested pSJ3 promoter probe vector, giving rise to plasmids pSJ3PN (PN::lacZ) and pSJ3RPN (Pr-bzdR/PN::lacZ) (Table I, Fig. 4). The correct lacZ translational fusions were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. Plasmids pUTminiTn5PN and pUTminiTn5RPN were constructed by subcloning the NotI cassettes from pSJ3PN and pSJ3RPN into the mini-Tn5 delivery plasmid pUTminiTn5Km2 (Table I, Fig. 4), and they were transferred from E. coli S17–1λpir to E. coli AFMC cells (Table I) by biparental filter mating (22Herrero M. de Lorenzo V. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6557-6567Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Exconjugants containing the PN::lacZ and PR-bzdR/PN::lacZ translational fusions inserted into their chromosomes were selected for the transposon marker, kanamycin, on rifampicin-containing LB medium, generating the E. coli AFMCPN and AFMCRPN strains, respectively (Table I).Fig. 4Schematic representation of the construction of the PN::lacZ and bzdR-PN::lacZ translational fusions.

Strain CIBdbzdR—For disruption of the bzdR gene through single homologous recombination, a 499-bp internal fragment of bzdR was PCR-amplified by using primers BzdRInt5′ (5′-GCGAGCGCAGCGGGGAATG-3′) and N-INV-III (5′-GCTTGCGACCACCGACTCC-3′), and it was cloned into the SmaI-digested pK18mob (a mobilizable plasmid that does not replicate in Azoarcus) (Table I). The resulting construct, pK18mobbzdR (Table I), was transferred from E. coli S17–1λpir (donor strain) into Azoarcus sp. strain CIB (recipient strain) by biparental filter mating (2Barragán M.J.L. Carmona M. Zamarro M.T. Thiele B. Boll M. Fuchs G. García J.L. Díaz E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5762-5774Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Exconjugants harboring the disrupted bzdR gene by insertion of the suicide plasmid, namely Azoarcus sp. strain CIBdbzdR, were isolated aerobically on kanamycin-containing MC medium lacking nitrate and containing 0.4% citrate as the sole carbon source for counterselection of donor cells. The mutant strain was analyzed by PCR to confirm the disruption of the target gene.Overproduction and Purification of His6-BzdR—The recombinant plasmid pQE32-His6BzdR (Table I) carries the bzdR gene without the ATG start codon and with a His6 tag coding sequence at its 5′-end, under control of the T5 promoter and two lac operator boxes. The His tail added 13 amino acids (MCGSHHHHHHGIL) to the N-terminal end of His6-BzdR-protein (34.842 Da). The His-tagged protein was overproduced in E. coli M15 strain harboring plasmid pREP4 (Table I) that produces the LacI repressor to strictly control gene expression from pQE32 derivatives in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. E. coli M15 (pREP4, pQE32-His6BzdR) cells were grown at 37 °C in 50 ml of ampicillin- and kanamycin-containing LB medium until the cultures reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5. Overexpression of the His-tagged protein was then induced during 3 h by the addition of 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested at 4 °C, resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm imidazole), and disrupted by passage through a French press (Aminco Corp.) operated at a pressure of 20,000 p.s.i. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The clear supernatant fluid was carefully decanted and applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen). Columns were then washed at 4 °C with 50 volumes of wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 40 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and the His-tagged BzdR protein was eluted by using elution buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 750 mm imidazole, pH 8.0). The purified protein was dialyzed at 4 °C in FP buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm KCl) and stored at -20 °C.Gel Retardation Assays—A 268-bp DNA fragment spanning from position -174 to +79 with respect to the transcription start site of PN promoter (Fig. 1B) was PCR-amplified from plasmid pSJ3PN (Table I) by using oligonucleotides 5BZN (see above) and RetIII (5′-GGGAATTCCGAGCCTCGCGTTTTACTGC-3′; an engineered EcoRI site is underlined). This fragment was digested with XbaI and EcoRI restriction enzymes, and it was cloned in XbaI/EcoRI double-digested pUC18 vector, giving rise to plasmid pUC18FP4 (Table I). The DNA fragment was then excised from pUC18FP4 by digestion with EcoRI and HincII restriction enzymes, and it was labeled by filling in the overhanging EcoRI-digested end with [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I as described by Sambrook et al. (8Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The labeled fragment (PN probe) was purified by using Gene-Clean Turbo (Q-BIOgene). The retardation reaction mixtures contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm KCl, 0.05 nm DNA probe, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and purified His6-BzdR protein in a 9-μl final volume. After incubation of the retardation mixtures for 20 min at 30 °C, mixtures were fractionated by electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide gels buffered with 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gels were dried onto Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences).DNase I Footprinting Assays—The DNA fragment used for DNase I footprinting assays was PCR-amplified from plasmid pECOR7 by using oligonucleotides 5IVTPN (5′-CGGAATTCCGTGCATCAATGATCCGGCAAG-3′), which hybridizes with the 3′-end of bzdR, and 3IVTPN (5′-CGGAATTCCATCGAACTATCTCCTCTGATG-3′; an engineered EcoRI site is underlined, and the bzdN start codon is indicated in boldface type). The amplified DNA fragment was then digested with PvuII and EcoRI restriction enzymes, and the resulting 376-bp substitution was singly 3′-end-labeled by filling in the overhanging EcoRI-digested end with [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment as indicated above. The labeled fragment was purified by using Gene-Clean Turbo (Q-BIOgene). For DNase I footprinting assays, the reaction mixture contained 2 nm DNA probe, 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and purified protein in 15 μl of FP buffer (see above). This mixture was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C, after which 3 μl (0.05 units) of DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) (prepared in 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 125 mm KCl, and 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5) was added, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for 20 s. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 180 μl of a solution containing 0.4 m sodium acetate, 2.5 mm EDTA, 50 μg/ml calf thymus DNA, and 0.3 μl/ml glycogen. After phenol/chloroform extraction, DNA fragments were precipitated with absolute ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, dried, and directly resuspended in 5 μl of 90% (v/v) formamide-loading gel buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 0.05% (w/v) xylene cyanol). Samples were then denatured at 95 °C for 2 min and fractionated in a 6% polyacrylamide-urea gel. A + G Maxam and Gilbert reactions (23Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499"
https://openalex.org/W2015741145,"Antibody-induced demyelination is an important component of pathology in multiple sclerosis. In particular, antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) are elevated in multiple sclerosis patients, and they have been implicated as mediators of demyelination. We have shown previously that antibody cross-linking of MOG in oligodendrocytes results in the repartitioning of MOG into glycosphingolipid-cholesterol membrane microdomains (“lipid rafts”), followed by changes in the phosphorylation of specific proteins, including dephosphorylation of β-tubulin and the β subunit of the trimeric G protein and culminating in rapid and dramatic morphological alterations. In order to further elucidate the mechanism of anti-MOG-mediated demyelination, we have carried out a proteomic analysis to identify the set of proteins for which the phosphorylation states or expression levels are altered upon anti-MOG treatment. We demonstrate that treatment of oligodendrocytes with anti-MOG alone leads to an increase in calcium influx and activation of the MAPK/Akt pathways that is independent of MOG repartitioning. However, further cross-linking of anti-MOG·MOG complexes with a secondary anti-IgG results in the lipid raft-dependent phosphorylation of specific proteins related to cellular stress response and cytoskeletal stability. Oligodendrocyte survival is not compromised by these treatments. We discuss the possible significance of the anti-MOG-induced signaling cascade in relation to the initial steps of MOG-mediated demyelination.

In particular, antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a highly encephalitogenic glycoprotein concentrated in the outer lamella of the myelin sheath and thus exposed to the environment (6Linington C. Webb M. Woodhams P.L. J. Neuroimmunol. 1984; 6: 387-396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), have been implicated as mediators of demyelination (7Cross A.H.

Upon ligand or antibody cross-linking, a variety of plasma membrane receptors undergo enhanced partitioning into glycosphingolipid-cholesterol membrane microdomains (“lipid rafts”) as an obligatory first step toward participation in early signal transduction events (11Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5059) Google Scholar, 12Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar, 13Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that antibody cross-linking of MOG on the surface of OLs results in the rapid repartitioning of a significant fraction of MOG into lipid rafts, followed by dephosphorylation of β-tubulin and the β subunit of the trimeric G protein (Gβ), and a rapid retraction of OL processes and myelin-like membranes (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to elucidate this mechanism and better consider its relationship to antibody-mediated demyelination in multiple sclerosis, we have taken a proteomic approach to identify target proteins for which the phosphorylation states and/or expression levels are altered upon MOG cross-linking. We show that antibody-induced activation of MOG signaling in its non-lipid raft state triggers the activation of MAPK and Akt pathways and an increase in calcium influx. Further cross-linking of anti-MOG·MOG complexes by anti-IgG leads to a requisite MOG repartitioning into lipid rafts, followed by the activation of signaling pathways related to stress response and cytoskeletal instability and finally dramatic changes in cellular morphology. These processes are reversible and, at least in the short run, nontoxic. We propose that the signaling cascade triggered upon antibody-mediated repartitioning of MOG into lipid rafts is pertinent to the initial steps of MOG-mediated demyelination in multiple sclerosis. Antibodies—Antibodies were obtained as follows: mouse monoclonal anti-MOG (8–18C5; Dr. C. Linington, University of Aberdeen, UK); anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) 513mAb (Dr. R.

O4 monoclonal antibody (15Sommer I. Schachner M. Dev. Biol. 1981; 83: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar) was prepared in our laboratory (16Bansal R. Warrington A.E. Gard A.L. Ranscht B. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Mixed primary cultures and highly enriched populations of maturing OLs were prepared as described previously (17Pfeiffer S.E. Warrington A.E. Bansal R. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 18Bansal R. Kumar M. Murray K. Morrison R.S. Pfeiffer S.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 263-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). OL populations were grown in defined medium modified N2 (19Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar, 20Gard A.L. Pfeiffer S.E. Development. 1989; 106: 119-132PubMed Google Scholar) for 7 days to obtain MOG-expressing OLs. Antibody Perturbation—OLs were first incubated at 37 °C with monoclonal anti-MOG antibody (155 μg/ml IgG) for various time intervals (5–60 min). Antibody was then washed out by two changes of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. In most cases, the OLs were then further incubated at 37 °C with goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500) for 5–60 min to cross-link the anti-MOG·MOG complexes formed in the first step. In some cases, cells were treated prior to antibody incubation with the protein kinase inhibitors (Calbiochem) PD098059 (50 μm), LY294002 (50 μm), or Y27632 (15 μm) for 2 h or with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD, 5 mm; Sigma) for 15 min at 37 °C. Controls were subjected to the same schedule of washes and incubations. Detergent Extraction and Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation— Cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of a solution of 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 25 mm Tris-Cl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin/aprotinin, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaP2O7, 1 mm sodium o-vanadate, and Triton X-100 (1% final concentration) as described previously (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 15 min) to separate them into a detergent-insoluble pellet and a detergent-soluble supernatant fraction and processed for immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. For sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kim T. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pellet fractions were mixed with 2 m sucrose, overlaid with 1 and 0.2 m sucrose, and centrifuged for 16 h at 200,000 × g at 4 °C. After centrifugation, 0.5-ml fractions were collected at 4 °C from the top (fraction 1) to the bottom (fraction 10) of the gradient. Immunoprecipitation—Soluble and insoluble fractions of the Triton X-100 extracts were solubilized in 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated overnight with anti-Fyn (1:50) at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (0.01 mg/ml) beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were separated by centrifugation, washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blot with anti-pan-Fyn or anti-phosphorylated Fyn (anti-pY418 or anti-pY529). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting Analysis—Solubilized samples (described above) were loaded onto acrylamide gels (Protean II minicell apparatus; Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was carried out using NIH Image 1.62. Two-dimensional PAGE—Two-dimensional PAGE was carried out as described previously (2Taylor C.M. Marta C.B. Claycomb R.J. Han D.K. Rasband M.N. Coetzee T. Pfeiffer S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4643-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S.

Briefly, OL extracts (300 μg of protein) were solubilized in 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% ASB-14, 0.5% IPG buffer 4–7, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.001% bromphenol blue. Samples were applied to Immobiline™ Dry Strip, pH 4–7, isoelectric focusing gels (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were separated in the first dimension (200 V, 1 h; 500 V, 1 h; 1,000 V, 1 h; ramped to 8,000 V, 30 min; held at 8,000 V for 30,000 V-h) at 20 °C using an IPGPhor electrophoresis unit (Amersham Biosciences). For the second dimension, SDS-PAGE was carried out in 10% acrylamide running gels. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Coomassie Blue-stained spots were excised and digested overnight with trypsin. Tryptic peptides were separated by microcapillary liquid chromatography coupled to a tandem mass spectrometer (LCQ-DECA; Finnigan-MAT, San Jose, CA; Center for Proteomics and Biological Mass Spectrometry at the University of Connecticut Health Center). Peptide fragmentation spectra were analyzed against the OWL data base by using the SEQUEST algorithm followed by INTERACT and PEPTIDE PROPHET (2Taylor C.M. Marta C.B. Claycomb R.J. Han D.K. Rasband M.N. Coetzee T. Pfeiffer S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4643-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Mature OLs were stained live with anti-sulfatide O4 (16Bansal R. Warrington A.E. Gard A.L. Ranscht B. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar) or fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with either phosphospecific (1:50) or total EF-2 (1:100) antibodies or with anti-MBP as described previously (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The diameter of randomly chosen cells (100 cells/experiment) was determined by using a calibrated microscopic grid. Detection of Cell Death—Cell death was detected by using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay (Apoptag kit; Serologicals Corp., Norcross, GA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described before (23Oh L.Y. Denninger A. Colvin J.S. Vyas A. Tole S. Ornitz D.M. Bansal R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 883-894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the total cell number was determined by Hoechst dye staining. Percentages of TUNEL+/total cells were estimated by analysis of at least 30 fields from three independent experiments (100 cells were analyzed in each experiment). Determination of cAMP and Calcium (Ca2+) Levels—Changes in cAMP levels upon MOG cross-linking were determined by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) following the manufacturer's instructions. To estimate changes in Ca2+ levels, mature OLs were labeled with 10 μg/ml Fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at 37 °C. After 30 min of recovery with fresh medium, anti-MOG antibody followed by anti-mouse IgG (5-min incubation each antibody at 37 °C), anti-MAG antibody followed by anti-mouse IgG (5 min incubation each antibody at 37 °C), or anti-mouse IgG alone (5-min incubation at 37 °C) was added to the culture. Fluorescence intensity changes (estimating Ca2+ levels) were recorded every 15 s (starting before the addition of anti-MOG or anti-MAG antibody) by time lapse confocal microscopy (LSM 510 Zeiss) using a thermo-controlled chamber. Image analysis was carried out with NIH Image 1.62. Ionomycin was used as a positive control. A total of 20 cells were analyzed for each condition. Statistical Analysis—Means and S.E. were calculated, and evaluation of statistical significance between conditions was made using Student's two-tailed t test. Identification of Proteins That Change Their Phosphorylation State upon MOG Cross-linking—We previously have shown (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kim T. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurocytol. 1999; 28: 281-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that treatment of live OLs with anti-MOG followed by cross-linking secondary antibody (subsequently referred to as MOG cross-linking) causes rapid repartitioning of MOG into a detergent-insoluble fraction. At least half of this fraction has key biochemical characteristics of lipid rafts, including detergent solubility at 37 °C or at 4 °C upon prior cholesterol perturbation, and low density. MOG repartitioning is followed rapidly by changes in the phosphorylation state of specific proteins and dramatic changes in OL cytoarchitecture. In contrast, treatment with anti-MOG alone was ineffective at inducing MOG repartitioning or changes in cell morphology (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); these effects were confirmed in this study, even when treatment with anti-MOG alone was extended to 60 min (Fig. 1A). To identify the proteins undergoing MOG cross-linking-mediated changes in phosphorylation state, we first resolved the total population of cellular proteins by two-dimensional PAGE, using a method that allows increased resolution of transmembrane and GPI-anchored proteins from lipid-rich membranes such as myelin and myelin-like membranes from OLs (22Taylor C.M. Pfeiffer S.E. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, B–D). No changes were observed in the overall pattern of proteins identified by silver staining (Fig. 1B). However, upon further analysis by anti-phosphoamino acid immunoblots generated from these two-dimensional gels, we found significant differences in the phosphorylation state of specific proteins (Fig. 1C). These phosphoproteins were then identified by mass spectrometry and/or two-dimensional Western blot with specific antisera (Fig. 1D). As noted previously (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Gβ and β-tubulin underwent dephosphorylation on threonine (Fig. 1C, spot 4) or tyrosine (Fig. 1C, spot 5), respectively. In addition, eight other proteins were identified (Figs. 1, C and D, and 2A) that underwent hyperphosphorylation of either tyrosine heat shock protein 74 (HSP74; spot 1), annexin vi (spot 2), Fyn (spot 3), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; spots 6–6′), α-enolase (spot 7), threonine collapsin response mediator protein-2 (CRMP-2; spot 8), elongation factor 2 (EF-2; spot 9), and/or serine α-enolase (spot 7), CRMP-2 (spot 8), Akt (identified by one-dimensional immunoblot with a phosphospecific antibody; Fig. 2A). In contrast to MOG, the detergent insolubility of these proteins was not changed upon cross-linking (data not shown). These proteins fall into three general functional categories involving cellular stress response, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal stability. Response of OLs to Anti-MOG Alone Compared with MOG Cross-linking—Extracellular signal-regulated kinase members of the MAPK kinase family, in close association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and its downstream effector Akt (24Rus H.G. Niculescu F.I. Shin M.L. Immunol. Rev. 2001; 180: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), promote OL survival (25Casaccia-Bonnefil P. Gu C. Khursigara G. Chao M.V. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 45: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Stariha R.L. Kim S.U. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 52: 680-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further investigation showed that in contrast to the other phosphoproteins that required MOG cross-linking, e.g. EF-2 (Fig. 2B and data not shown), treatment with anti-MOG antibody alone (i.e. no secondary cross-linking) led to hyperphosphorylation of both MAPK and Akt (Fig. 2B). In many cases, an interrelationship has been observed between protein phosphorylation and the intracellular levels of calcium (Ca2+) and/or cAMP. For example, Gβ down-regulates Ca2+ influx by modulating the activity of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (27Diverse-Pierluissi M. McIntire W.E. Myung C.S. Lindorfer M.A. Garrison J.C. Goy M.F. Dunlap K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28380-28385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar); increased Ca2+ levels lead to the phosphorylation of certain proteins, including MAPK (28Liu H.N. Larocca J.N. Almazan G. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 66: 50-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 29Pancholi V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 902-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 30Watanabe T. Inui M. Chen B.Y. Iga M. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17656-17662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and calcium-calmodulin kinase III phosphorylates EF-2 in response to both Ca2+ and cAMP (31Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined Ca2+ and cAMP levels before and after exposure of OLs to antibodies. Calcium levels rapidly increased (≤1 min) upon treatment with anti-MOG alone; they remained elevated without further increase, even after the addition of secondary cross-linking antibody (starting at 300 s, see arrow; Fig. 3A). As controls, this response was not observed when cross-linking was carried out using anti-myelin-associated glycoprotein (anti-MAG) antibody or secondary antibody alone (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the levels of cAMP in OLs were unchanged by treatment with either anti-MOG antibody alone, anti-MOG followed by secondary antibody, or secondary antibody alone (Fig. 3B). We conclude that treatment with anti-MOG antibody alone is sufficient to cause increased Ca2+ levels and hyperphosphorylation of MAPK and Akt. Changes in Stress Response-related Proteins upon MOG Cross-linking—The cellular stress response (e.g. heat shock) is a protective mechanism that enhances cell survival in times of environmental stress by down-regulating the level of protein synthesis, thereby limiting the accumulation of misfolded proteins (32Fogli A. Dionisi-Vici C. Deodato F. Bartuli A. Boespflug-Tanguy O. Bertini E. Neurology. 2002; 59: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The MOG cross-linking-dependent hyperphosphorylations of EF-2, HSP74, and α-enolase (another heat shock protein) (29Pancholi V. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 902-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) are consistent with a cellular stress response. In addition, the level of HSC70, a member of the HSP70 family previously implicated in multiple sclerosis (33Aquino D.A. Capello E. Weisstein J. Sanders V. Lopez C. Tourtellotte W.W. Brosnan C.F. Raine C.S. Norton W.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 56: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was also significantly increased upon MOG cross-linking, whereas the total levels of two other heat shock proteins, HSP90 and HSP32, were unaffected (Fig. 4A). Since EF-2 is inactivated by phosphorylation at residue Thr56, thereby preventing the elongation step of protein synthesis (31Ryazanov A.G. Shestakova E.A. Natapov P.G. Nature. 1988; 334: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), we used an antibody directed against phospho-EF-2/Thr56 to further study this protein in OLs. We found that EF-2 did in fact undergo hyperphosphorylation at Thr56 upon MOG cross-linking and that this occurred in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction; as shown also in Fig. 1B, the total level of EF-2 was unmodified (Fig. 4A). Immunocytochemistry further confirmed the cross-linking-dependent hyperphosphorylation of EF-2 in OLs, accompanied by the predicted retraction of OL processes (Fig. 4B, d). The changes in stress-responding proteins and OL morphology could in principle be an indication of cell death. However, the number of TUNEL+ cells was unchanged even when cells were cross-linked for either up to 2 h and analyzed immediately or for 30 min and then analyzed 2–14 h after antibody removal (Supplementary Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained when cell death was evaluated by propidium iodine staining (not shown). We conclude that antibody cross-linking of OLs in culture does not lead to cell death over the time periods studied, and in fact previous studies have shown that the physiological changes induced by MOG cross-linking are reversible (14Marta C.B. Taylor C.M. Coetzee T. Kim T. Winkler S. Bansal R. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5461-5471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Role of Cytoskeletal-related Proteins in MOG-mediated Events—The cytoskeleton is a critical mediator of cellular physiology. Several proteins that change their phosphorylation state upon MOG cross-linking (Fig. 1) regulate cytoskeletal dynamics. CRMP-2 activation is related to depolymerization of both actin microfilaments and microtubules (34Fukata Y. Itoh T.J. Kimura T. Menager C. Nishimura T. Shiromizu T. Watanabe H. Inagaki N. Iwamatsu A. Hotani H. Kaibuchi K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 35Liu B.P. Strittmatter S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); changes in β-tubulin and Fyn phosphorylation affect microtubule integrity (36Osterhout D.J. Wolven A. Wolf R.M. Resh M.D. Chao M.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1209-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 37MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 38Atashi J.R. Klinz S.G. Ingraham C.A. Matten W.T. Schachner M. Maness P.F. Neuron. 1992; 8: 831-842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar); and annexin vi phosphorylation increases its calcium binding affinity (39Freye-Minks C. Kretsinger R.H. Creutz C.E. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 620-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), leading to an inhibition of F-actin polymerization (30Watanabe T. Inui M. Chen B.Y. Iga M. Sobue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17656-17662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Noting that the phosphorylation of CRMP-2 by active Rho serine/threonine kinase leads to actin depolymerization during growth cone collapse (35Liu B.P. Strittmatter S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we studied the effect of exposing OLs to a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y27632) (40Niederost B. Oertle T. Fritsche J. McKinney R.A. Bandtlow C.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10368-10376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) prior to MOG cross-linking (Fig. 5). As expected, this treatment prevented the increased phosphorylation of CRMP-2 upon cross-linking (Fig. 5A) and, in addition, significantly attenuated, but did not completely eliminate, the MOG cross-linking-mediated retraction of OL processes (Fig. 5, B, b and f, and C, b and f). The Rho kinase inhibitor did not prevent changes in either the phosphorylation state of MAPK or Akt (Fig. 5D) or of the other proteins whose phosphorylation state was altered by MOG cross-linking (data not shown). These data indicate that although Rho kinase is clearly an important mediator of the MOG cross-linking-mediated changes in OL morphology, presumably operating through CRMP-2, other molecules unaffected by the Rho kinase inhibitor also must contribute to this process. Further, although pretreatment of OLs with inhibitors of either MAPK (PD098059) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (LY294002) prior to MOG cross-linking eliminated the increased phosphorylation of MAPK and Akt, respectively (Fig. 5D), it did not prevent changes in OL morphology (Fig. 5, B, c, d, g, and h, and C, c, d, g, and h). Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-tubulin is stimulated by activation (i.e. phosphorylation) of insulin growth factor receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor (a member of the Erb family of receptor tyrosine kinases) and by Src kinases such as Fyn (37MacRae T.H.

https://openalex.org/W2075765538,"NS3 (nonstructural protein 3) from the hepatitis C virus is a 3′ → 5′ helicase classified in helicase superfamily 2. The optimally active form of this helicase remains uncertain. We have used unwinding assays in the presence of a protein trap to investigate the first cycle of unwinding by full-length NS3. When the enzyme was in excess of the substrate, NS3 (500 nm) unwound >80% of a DNA substrate containing a 15-nucleotide overhang and a 30-bp duplex (45:30-mer; 1 nm). This result indicated that the active form of NS3 that was bound to the DNA prior to initiation of the reaction was capable of processive DNA unwinding. Unwinding with varying ratios of NS3 to 45:30-mer allowed us to investigate the active form of NS3 during the first unwinding cycle. When the substrate concentration slightly exceeded that of the enzyme, little or no unwinding was observed, indicating that if a monomeric form of the protein is active, then it exhibits very low processivity. Binding of NS3 to the 45:30-mer was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, resulting in KD = 2.7 ± 0.4 nm. Binding to individual regions of the substrate was investigated by measuring the KD for a 15-mer oligonucleotide as well as a 30-mer duplex. NS3 bound tightly to the 15-mer (KD = 1.3 ± 0.2 nm) and, surprisingly, fairly tightly to the double-stranded 30-mer (KD = 11.3 ± 1.3 nm). However, NS3 was not able to rapidly unwind a blunt-end duplex. Thus, under conditions of optimal unwinding, the 45:30-mer is initially saturated with the enzyme, including the duplex region. The unwinding data are discussed in terms of a model whereby multiple molecules of NS3 bound to the single-stranded DNA portion of the substrate are required for optimal unwinding.

Helicases are enzymes that provide single-stranded nucleic acid intermediates for processes such as replication, recombination, and repair of nucleic acids (1Hall M.C. Matson S.W. Mol.

These enzymes are proposed to use the energy gained from ATP hydrolysis to separate double-stranded nucleic acids. The unwinding mechanism of a helicase may reflect the oligomeric state of the enzyme. Helicases such as Escherichia coli DnaB (5Bujalowski W. Klonowska M.M. Jezewska M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31350-31358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bacteriophage T4 gp41 (6Dong F. Gogol E.P. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 10668-10675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been shown to exist as hexamers. These hexameric helicases are proposed to operate through a DNA exclusion mechanism in which the hexamer encircles one strand of a duplex and excludes the complementary strand during translocation along the DNA (3Patel S.S. Picha K.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 651-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 8Egelman E.H. Yu X. Wild R. Hingorani M.M. Patel S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It has also been determined that some hexameric helicases such as DnaB may drive branch migration by acting as a molecular pump (11Bujalowski W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 116-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 12Kaplan D.L. O'Donnell M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Most helicases are believed to translocate with a directional bias along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). 1The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EMSAs, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; F-T15, 3′-fluorescein-labeled T15; F-30-mer, 3′-fluorescein-labeled 30-mer; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); HCV, hepatitis C virus. Dda helicase from bacteriophage T4 was proposed to use force to remove proteins bound to DNA based upon its ability to displace streptavidin from biotin-labeled oligonucleotides in a directionally biased manner (10Morris P.D. Raney K.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5164-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 13Morris P.D. Tackett A.J. Babb K. Nanduri B. Chick C. Scott J. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19691-19698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ability of Dda to displace proteins from DNA increases when multiple molecules of Dda are involved in the reaction (14Byrd A.B. Raney K.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2004; 11: 531-538Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The active form of many helicases still remains unresolved. Dda was shown to be capable of functioning as a monomer during unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) (15Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14722-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PcrA helicase from Bacillus stearothermophilus has been proposed to function as a monomer based on x-ray crystallographic studies (16Bird L.E. Brannigan J.A. Subramanya H.S. Wigley D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2686-2693Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 17Soultanas P. Dillingham M.S. Wiley P. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B.

Biochemical studies of the translocation activity of PcrA on ssDNA also support PcrA function as a monomer (19Dillingham M.S. Wigley D.B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 643-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Dda and PcrA are proposed to utilize an “inchworm-like” mechanism in which a monomeric helicase has two DNA-binding sites that allow a cycle of unwinding and translocation along a nucleic acid lattice. Biochemical and biophysical evidence has been presented supporting a dimeric form of the UvrD helicase (20Maluf N.K. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 889-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Maluf N.K. Fischer C.J. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 913-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). NS3 (nonstructural protein 3) from the hepatitis C virus contains 3′ → 5′ helicase activity in the C-terminal domain as well as serine protease activity in the N-terminal domain (22Neddermann P. Tomei L. Steinkuhler C. Gallinari P. Tramontano A. De Francesco R. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 469-476PubMed Google Scholar). In work with the helicase domain of NS3 (NS3h), Preugschat et al. (23Preugschat F. Danger D.P. Carter III, L.H. Davis R.G. Porter D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5174-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) mixed NS3h mutants lacking strand-separating activity in steady-state unwinding assays with wild-type NS3h and observed no dominant-negative phenotype that would be expected if NS3h requires oligomerization to function. This negative result was proposed to illustrate a monomeric form of the helicase domain of NS3 and supported an inchworm-like mechanism as suggested from the x-ray crystal structure of NS3h bound to a dU8 oligonucleotide (24Kim J.L. Morgenstern K.A. Griffith J.P. Dwyer M.D. Thomson J.A. Murcko M.A. Lin C. Caron P.R. Structure. 1998; : 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). In contrast, Levin and Patel (25Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) reported that the helicase domain of NS3 is active as an oligomer. Oligomerization of NS3h was indicated by protein-protein cross-linking and by unwinding assays in which an ATPase-deficient mutant form of NS3h was mixed with wild-type NS3h under conditions of excess enzyme, which revealed that 13.5 molecules of NS3h were required for unwinding a 33-bp substrate. Levin and Patel (25Levin M.K. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31839-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) proposed a model of unwinding that utilizes a cycle of transient protein-protein interactions that result in exchange of NS3h molecules through dissociation during translocation and unwinding. Most recently, Patel and co-workers (26Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have proposed a model for unwinding by NS3h that does not require protein-protein interactions, but does rely on functional cooperativity between helicase monomers. We have investigated the active form of full-length NS3 during the first unwinding cycle with a series of unwinding experiments in the presence of a protein trap and varying ratios of NS3 to DNA substrate. A protein trap allows the investigation of actively bound NS3 during the first unwinding cycle by removing NS3 that is not initially bound to the DNA substrate and sequestering NS3 that dissociates from the DNA substrate. Optimal unwinding was observed only under conditions that favor binding of multiple NS3 molecules to the single-stranded region of the substrate. The results are qualitatively similar to those reported by Patel and co-workers (26Levin M.K. Wang Y.H. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26005-26012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) for the NS3 helicase domain. Materials—Na4EDTA, SDS, bovine serum albumin, β-mercaptoethanol, MOPS, NaCl, acrylamide, bisacrylamide, MgCl2, KOH, ATP, formamide, xylene cyanol, bromphenol blue, HEPES, urea, and glycerol were from Fisher. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Poly(U) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. DNA oligonucleotides were from Integrated DNA Technologies. Sephadex G-25 was from Sigma. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. Recombinant full-length NS3 was expressed and purified as described previously (27Tackett A.J. Wei L. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Concentrations of nucleic acid oligonucleotides are in strands, whereas concentrations of nucleic acid polymers are in nucleotides. Unwinding Substrate—The primary substrate used to monitor NS3 unwinding was a 45:30-mer partial duplex containing a T15 single-stranded overhang: 3′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCATCATGCAGGACAGTCGGATCGCAGTCAG-5′ and 5′-GTAGTACGTCCTGTCAGCCTAGCGTCAGTC-3′. A 60:30-mer was used in some experiments that was identical to the 45:30-mer except that the 3′-overhang contained 15 additional thymidine residues. Each DNA oligonucleotide was purified by preparative gel electrophoresis (13Morris P.D. Tackett A.J. Babb K. Nanduri B. Chick C. Scott J. Raney K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19691-19698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Crude oligonucleotide was suspended in formamide and resolved on a 7 m urea and 20% polyacrylamide vertical slab gel (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). Oligonucleotide was visualized by UV shadowing and excised from the gel. Purified oligonucleotide was electroeluted from the gel slice using a Schleicher & Schüll Elutrap apparatus. Purified oligonucleotides were then desalted on a Waters Sep-Pak C18 column and lyophilized using a Savant Speed-Vac. The lyophilized oligonucleotides were suspended in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA. Oligonucleotide concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm in 0.2 m KOH and applying calculated extinction coefficients (28Carroll S.S. Benseler F. Olsen D.B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 365-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To create the partial duplex unwinding substrate, a 1:2 ratio of 45-mer to 30-mer was heated at 95 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture of the 45:30-mer partial duplex was resolved on a native 20% polyacrylamide gel, electroeluted, desalted, and quantified as described above. The purified 45-mer was 5′-radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeling reaction proceeded for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by heat denaturation of the enzyme at 70 °C for 10 min. The unlabeled 30-mer (1 eq) was added to the 5′-radiolabeled 45-mer. Excess [γ-32P]ATP was removed by passage through two 1-ml Sephadex G-25 spin columns. The 5′-radiolabeled 45:30-mer was heated to 95 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. This stock solution of the radiolabeled 45:30-mer was added to a more concentrated stock solution of the gel-purified 45:30-mer to create the substrate for DNA unwinding experiments. Unwinding Assays—The NS3 unwinding experiments in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 were performed using a KinTek rapid chemical quench-flow instrument maintained at 37 °C with a circulating water bath. All concentrations listed are after mixing. NS3 unwinding buffer consisted of 50 mm K+MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 μm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm NaCl. For excess enzyme experiments, 45:30-mer DNA (1 nm) was incubated with NS3 (500 nm) prior to initiating the unwinding reaction with 5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. For experiments performed with a protein trap, 5–75 μm poly(U) was incubated with ATP and MgCl2 unless otherwise stated. After rapid mixing of the NS3/45:30-mer solution with the ATP/MgCl2/poly(U) solution, the reaction was quenched with 200 mm EDTA and 0.7% SDS. To prevent re-annealing of the ssDNA products, a DNA trapping strand was added to the vial in which the quenched solution was collected. The DNA trapping strand was a 30-mer that was complementary to the 30-mer in the 45:30-mer substrate and was added in 30-fold excess of the substrate. A 25-μl aliquot of the quenched reaction mixture was added to 5 μl of loading buffer (30% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) and electrophoresed on a 20% polyacrylamide gel. The amount of free 45-mer and 45:30-mer was quantified using an Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (13Morris P.D. Tackett A.J. Babb K. Nanduri B. Chick C. Scott J. Raney K.D.

Unwinding experiments with 25 or 100 nm 45:30-mer and NS3 were performed as described above except that 3 μm DNA trapping strand was incubated with the ATP/MgCl2/poly(U) solution to prevent re-formation of the substrate during the reaction. The addition of the 30-mer DNA trapping strand to the reaction will affect the observed rate for unwinding during multiple cycle conditions in the absence of a protein trap by serving as a binding site for NS3, but it should not affect the first cycle of unwinding by the initially bound NS3 with or without a protein trap (15Nanduri B.

This method of data analysis utilizes differential equations to describe each of the species and provides the best fit to the data in accordance with the model. Scheme 1 describes the steps involved in product formation that account for the “lag” during the rapid phase of strand separation as well as the slow conversion of nonproductively bound NS3 to productive NS3 (31Cheng W.

The unwinding reaction was performed at 37 °C, and the reaction was quenched with 200 mm EDTA and 0.7% SDS. The protein trapping efficiency of poly(U) was determined by incubating 75 μm poly(U) with 100 nm 45:30-mer prior to adding 2000 nm NS3, after which 5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 were added (▪).

EMSA binding buffer consisted of 50 mm K+MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 μm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm NaCl. Varying concentrations of NS3 were incubated with 0.1 nm 5′-radiolabeled T15, 30:30-mer duplex (identical to the duplex portion of the 45:30-mer), or 45:30-mer DNA in binding buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. For stoichiometric binding assays, the DNA concentration was increased to >10-fold above the KD as determined from the EMSA. 100 nm 45:30-mer or T15 was incubated with varying concentrations of NS3 in binding buffer for 5 min at 37 °C. Following the incubation, glycerol was added to 5%, and the samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel at 200 V using a PROTEAN II xi system (Bio-Rad). The amount of DNA bound was determined using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. The amount of DNA bound was quantified from the loss of the band representing the free DNA. The binding data at 0.1 nm DNA were fit to a hyperbola to determine KD values using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software). Fluorescence Polarization with Fluorescein-labeled DNA—Fluorescence polarization was used to monitor the interaction of NS3 with the DNA substrate. Fluorescence polarization buffer consisted of 50 mm K+MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 μm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm NaCl. 3′-Fluorescein-labeled T15 (F-T15) and 3′-fluorescein-labeled 30-mer (F-30-mer) were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and purified by preparative gel electrophoresis. The F-30-mer was identical to the 30-mer in the 45:30-mer DNA substrate. Duplexes were prepared by mixing the F-30-mer with a complementary 30-mer or 45-mer. The blunt-end F-30:30-mer and 45:F-30-mer were purified by nondenaturing preparative gel electrophoresis as described above. Varying concentrations of NS3 were incubated with 0.1 nm F-T15, F-30: 30-mer, or 45:F-30-mer in fluorescence polarization buffer for 3 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 1 ml/sample. Fluorescence polarization was monitored on a Beacon fluorescence polarization instrument (Invitrogen). Fluorescence polarization buffer was used as the blank. The change in millipolarization units was determined using a sample of 0.1 nm fluorescein-labeled DNA as the zero point. After reading each sample, 10 mm MgCl2 and1mm ATPγS (Sigma) were added to each sample. Following a 3-min incubation at 37 °C, the fluorescence polarization of each sample was again obtained. Fluorescence polarization data were fit to a hyperbola to obtain KD values using KaleidaGraph. Fluorescence Titration Assays Measuring Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence—NS3 was titrated with poly(U), and the change in protein fluorescence was measured using an SLM-AMINCO luminescence spectrometer. Samples were excited at 280 nm with a band pass of 4 nm, and emission was monitored at 340 nm with a band pass of 8 nm. The instrument was maintained at 25 °C with a circulating water bath. Titration buffer contained 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 50 μm EDTA, 10 mm NaCl, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The NS3 concentration was 100 nm. Corrections for dilution and inner filter effects were applied. Prior to the addition of poly(U), NS3 was allowed to equilibrate for ∼45 min because the intrinsic fluorescence of the sample exhibited a gradual reduction over this time (32Lam A.M. Keeney D. Eckert P.Q. Frick D.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3950-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The titration data were fit to a quadratic equation using KaleidaGraph Version 3.5 software. Unwinding under Excess Enzyme Conditions—The ability of full-length NS3 to unwind partial duplex DNA was monitored under excess enzyme conditions. NS3 (500 nm) was incubated with 45:30-mer partial duplex DNA (1 nm) prior to initiating unwinding with 5 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C. Under these conditions of low DNA concentration, re-annealing of ssDNA products to re-form substrate during the reaction is very slow and does not affect the observed rates (27Tackett A.J. Wei L. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Amaratunga M. Lohman T.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6815-6820Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To prevent re-annealing of ssDNA products after the reaction had been quenched with 200 mm EDTA and 0.7% SDS, a 30-fold excess of 30-mer DNA trapping strand complementary to the 30-mer in the 45:30-mer substrate was placed in the receiving vial for the KinTek rapid chemical quench-flow apparatus. The formation of ssDNA products was observed by 5′-radiolabeling the 45-mer of the substrate. Free 45-mer unwinding product was separated from the 45:30-mer unwinding substrate on a 20% polyacrylamide gel and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 1A). Under these conditions, product formation consisted of a fast phase of rapid unwinding, followed by a second slower phase (Fig. 1). The majority of ssDNA is formed during the fast phase, which is characterized by a lag in the initial portion of the unwinding curve. The lag is due to the fact that ssDNA product is not observed until the helicase unwinds most of the duplex. More than one step is required to do this, so a lag appears in the early portion of the time course for DNA unwinding (33Ali J.A. Lohman T.M. Science. 1997; 275: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The unwinding data were fit to Scheme 1 using the program Scientist (27Tackett A.J. Wei L. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Cheng W. Hsieh J. Brendza K.M. Lohman T.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 327-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The steps in Scheme 1 are the minimal number required to fit the unwinding data for the 30-bp substrate. Two species for DNA unwinding are shown, ES1 and ES2, which correspond to productively bound enzyme and a kinetic intermediate, respectively. The intermediate is believed to represent a partially unwound substrate that occurs along the pathway to fully unwound DNA. The lag phase in product formation is described by the formation of the ES2 intermediate prior to complete unwinding. A slower phase is observed after the lag phase, which is accounted for by the conversion of a nonproductive ES complex (ESNP) to a productive complex (27Tackett A.J. Wei L. Cameron C.E. Raney K.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 31Cheng W. Hsieh J. Brendza K.M. Lohman T.M. J. Mol.

To investigate whether the large steady-state pools of PI and apolar PIMs are required for mycobacterial growth, we have generated a Mycobacterium smegmatis inositol auxotroph by disruption of the ino1 gene. The ino1 mutant displayed wild-type growth rates and steady-state levels of PI, PIM, and LAM when grown in the presence of 1 mm inositol. The non-dividing ino1 mutant was highly resistant to inositol starvation, reflecting the slow turnover of inositol lipids in this stage. In contrast, dilution of growing or stationary-phase ino1 mutant in inositol-free medium resulted in the rapid depletion of PI and apolar PIMs. Whereas depletion of these lipids was not associated with loss of viability, subsequent depletion of polar PIMs coincided with loss of major cell wall components and cell viability. Metabolic labeling experiments confirmed that the large pools of PI and apolar PIMs were used to sustain polar PIM and LAM biosynthesis during inositol limitation. They also showed that under non-limiting conditions, PI is catabolized via lyso-PI. These data suggest that large pools of PI and apolar PIMs are not essential for membrane integrity but are required to sustain polar PIM biosynthesis, which is essential for mycobacterial growth.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, infects nearly one third of the world population and causes active disease in an estimated 16 million people worldwide (1Onyebujoh P. Rook G.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 930-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The distinctive cell wall of M. tuberculosis and other pathogenic mycobacteria (M. leprae, M. avium-M. intracellulare complex, and M. ulcerans) confers protection against a range of microbicidal processes and many classes of antibiotics and undoubtedly contributes to the success of these organisms as pathogens. The mycobacterial cell wall contains a number of unusual features, including the presence of a highly structured peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan (AG) 1The abbreviations used are: AG, arabinogalactan; GPL, glycopeptidolipid; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; IPS, inositol-1-phosphate synthase; LAM, lipoarabinomannan; LM, lipomannan; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PIM, phosphatidylinositol mannoside; cfu, colony-forming unit(s); ORF, open reading frame.-mycolic acid macromolecule and a diverse array of glycolipids that form an asymmetric outer bilayer with the mycolic acids (2Brennan P.J.

Mycobacteria and other members of the Actinomycetales also differ from other eubacteria in synthesizing phosphatidylinositol (PI) and the biosynthetically related lipoglycans, PI mannosides (PIMs), lipomannan (LM), and lipoarabinomannan (LAM) (5Besra G.S.

Whereas there is accumulating evidence that the PIMs and LM/LAM have potent immuno-modulatory activities that may be important for the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis (7Briken V. Porcelli S.A.

This conclusion is supported by the finding that both phosphatidylinositol synthase and PimA, the first mannosyltransferase in the PIM/LM/LAM pathway (Fig. 1), are essential for growth and viability of the saprophytic mycobacteria species M. smegmatis (11Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 12Kordulakova J. Gilleron M. Mikusova K. Puzo G. Brennan P.J.

It is possible that the large steady-state pools of PI and apolar PIM species may be required for cell membrane integrity and/or other membrane functions. In this regard, it is notable that PI is a bilayer-forming phospholipids, whereas cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine, the other major phospholipids in the mycobacterial membrane, can form non-bilayer structures (13Dowhan W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 199-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar). Alternatively, or in addition, PI and apolar PIMs could function as a large dynamic pool of precursors for polar PIMs and LM/LAM biosynthesis. In order to investigate the potential role(s) of PI and PIMs as both precursor and end products, we have generated a M. smegmatis inositol auxotroph by disrupting the ino1 gene encoding inositol-3-phosphate synthase (IPS). IPS is a key enzyme in the only known pathway for the de novo synthesis of inositol from d-glucose-6-phosphate (Fig. 1). The rate of synthesis of PI and downstream products in this mutant should therefore be dependent on the supply of extracellular inositol. Stoker and co-workers (14Movahedzadeh F. Smith D.A. Norman R.A. Dinadayala P. Murray-Rust J. Russell D.G. Kendall S.L. Rison S.C. McAlister M.S. Bancroft G.J. McDonald N.Q. Daffe M. Av-Gay Y. Stoker N.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have recently disrupted the orthologous gene in M. tuberculosis. The M. tuberculosis mutant required very high levels of exogenous inositol for growth and was severely attenuated in macrophages and severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (14Movahedzadeh F. Smith D.A. Norman R.A. Dinadayala P. Murray-Rust J. Russell D.G. Kendall S.L. Rison S.C. McAlister M.S. Bancroft G.J. McDonald N.Q. Daffe M. Av-Gay Y. Stoker N.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, cellular levels of inositol lipids did not decrease when the M. tuberculosis mutant was suspended in inositol-free medium, although this may have been due to the use of non-replicating cultures (14Movahedzadeh F. Smith D.A. Norman R.A. Dinadayala P. Murray-Rust J. Russell D.G. Kendall S.L. Rison S.C. McAlister M.S. Bancroft G.J. McDonald N.Q. Daffe M. Av-Gay Y. Stoker N.G. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that inositol starvation has little effect on the cellular levels of inositol lipids or the viability of the non-replicating M. smegmatis ino1 mutant. In contrast, dilution of the ino1 mutant in inositol-free medium resulted in the rapid depletion of PI and apolar PIMs and a slower depletion of polar PIMs. Depletion of polar PIMs coincided with loss of other cell wall components and cell viability. We have also identified a novel lipase-mediated catabolic pathway that is involved in regulating cellular levels of PI in both wild-type and mutant M. smegmatis. These findings provide new insights into the function and metabolism of PI and PI-containing glycolipids in mycobacteria. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue MRF′ (Stratagene) was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium. Wild-type M. smegmatis mc2155 (15Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar) and the mutants derived from it were routinely grown on M9 agar (16Sambrook J. Russell D.G. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Handbook. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) with 0.4% glucose and 1.5% agar supplemented with 1 mm inositol, except where stated. Mycobacteria used for all growth and biochemical studies were grown in M9 broth with 0.4% (w/v) glucose and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 and supplemented with inositol as required. Antibiotics, streptomycin (20 μg/ml), kanamycin (20 μg/ml), or ampicillin (100 μg/ml) was added to media as required. Growth and survival of the cultures were measured by counting colony-forming units (cfu) using solid M9 media containing 1 mm inositol as a test medium or by measurement of cellular protein (17Meyers P.R. Bourn W.R. Steyn L.M. van Helden P.D. Beyers A.D. Brown G.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1998; 36: 2752-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from mycobacteria as described (18Jeevarajah D. Patterson J.H. Taig E. Sargent T. McConville M.J. Billman-Jacobe H. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6792-6799Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PCRs were performed in an MJ Research PTC-200 Peltier thermal cycler. Reactions contained 10 ng of template DNA, 20 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, 2 units of Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) or 0.2–1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science), and the enzyme reaction buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Southern hybridization using digoxygenin-labeled probes (Roche Applied Science) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transformation of bacteria was performed using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. Competent M. smegmatis cells were prepared as described previously (19Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L. Snapper S.B. Udani R.A. Jones W. Barletta R.G. Bloom B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 537-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Creation and Genetic Characterization of a M. smegmatis ino1 Mutant—A Lambda FixII (Stratagene) genomic library of M. smegmatis was screened by plaque hybridization using an oligonucleotide homologous to the M. tuberculosis ino1 gene (5′-GACTTCCTGAACATGCTGG). The probe bound to a phage clone, ϕHBJ24, which had previously been shown to contain ponA (20Billman-Jacobe H. Haites R.E. Coppel R.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 3011-3013Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further analysis showed that ino1 was a 1089-bp ORF that was contained on a 3.6-kb PstI fragment along with three other ORFs. The 3.6-kb PstI fragment was subcloned into the PstI site of pBluescript SK(+) and then linearized by digestion of a BalI site 634 bp into the ino1 ORF. A kanamycin resistance cassette, aphA-3, was derived by PCR, using M13 universal primers, from pUC18K (21Menard R. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5899-5906Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) and then digested with SmaI and cloned into the BalI site of pHBJ228 to disrupt ino1. This construct was then linearized by digestion of the HindIII site of the pBluescript SK(+) cloning site, treated with T4-DNA polymerase, and then ligated with a streptomycin resistance gene that had been excised from pHP45Ω (22Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar) by SmaI digestion. The resulting plasmid, pHBJ244, was transformed into M. smegmatis for allelic exchange to replace the chromosomal copy of ino1 with a disrupted version. Transformants were selected on LB media containing 55 mm inositol and kanamycin. Potential double crossover mutants (kanamycin-resistant, streptomycin-sensitive) were screened for their ability to grow in the absence of inositol on M9 minimal medium. The disruption of ino1inan inositol auxotroph was confirmed by Southern hybridization. The blots were hybridized with a 411-bp digoxygenin-labeled DNA probe derived by PCR from ino1 using primers (5′-TCGGAAGAGGCCGACAAG and 5′-TTGCGGTCGTCGAGCCAG). The hybridizing PstI and Bgl11 fragments of the mutant were 800 bp larger than the corresponding bands in the parent, showing that ino1 had increased in size due to disruption by the 800-bp aphA-3. The ino1 mutant was complemented with an intact copy of the ino1 gene on a mycobacterial shuttle vector, pHBJ334, which is a streptomycin-resistant derivative of pMV261 (23Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F. Snapper B. Barletta R.G. Jacobs W.R. Bloom B.R. Nature. 1991; 351: 456-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). The complementation plasmid, pHBJ378, was made by cloning a PCR-amplified copy of the ino1 gene (primers 5′-CGGAATTCTCTGAGCACGCAGGAG and 5′-CGGAATTCAGCCCTCGATGAAGG) into the EcoRI site of the vector such that the gene would be transcribed by the GroEL promoter. Both pHBJ378 and the vector pHBJ334 were introduced into M. smegmatis mc2155 wild type and ino1 mutant strains by electrotransformation (19Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kalpana G.V. Cirillo J.D. Pascopella L.

IPS Enzyme Assay—The IPS activity was assayed essentially as described previously (24Klig L.S. Antonsson B. Schmid E. Friedli L. Yeast. 1991; 7: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), except that the inositol and glucose in the samples were detected by aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) sheets (Merck). The HPTLC was developed three times in 1-propanol:acetone:water (9:6:5, 5:4:1, and 9:6:5, v/v), and then the amount of inositol and glucose was measured on a HPTLC plate reader (Berthold). Enzyme activity was expressed as units/mg protein. One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 nmol of d-myo-inositol-3-phosphate in 1 h. Extraction and Analysis of M. smegmatis Cell Wall Components— Mycobacterial cells were harvested from liquid cultures by centrifugation and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Lipids were extracted twice in 20 volumes of CHCl3:CH3OH (2:1, v/v) and once in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O (1:2:0.8, v/v) for 2 h at room temperature. The extracts were combined and dried under a stream of N2, and lipids were separated from salts and polar metabolites by biphasic partitioning in 1-butanol:water (2:1, v/v). LM/LAM was extracted from the delipidated pellet with three rounds of refluxing in 50% ethanol for 2 h at 100 °C. The combined 50% ethanol extracts were dried under N2, and LAM was purified by octyl-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography (25Morita Y.S. Patterson J.H. Billman-Jacobe H. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 589-597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipids (PI, PIMs, and GPLs) were analyzed by HPTLC and loading normalized to cellular protein (17Meyers P.R. Bourn W.R. Steyn L.M. van Helden P.D. Beyers A.D. Brown G.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1998; 36: 2752-2754Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PI and PIMs were resolved in CHCl3:CH3OH:1 m NH4OAc:13 m NH3:H2O (180:140:9:9:23, v/v) (solvent 1), and GPLs were resolved in CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1, v/v) (solvent 2). HPTLC plates were stained with orcinol/H2SO4 (carbohydrate), cupric acetate (lipids), or molybdate stain (phospholipids) (26Macala L.J. Yu R.K. Ando S. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1243-1250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cupric acetate-stained bands were quantitated by densitometry with the Kodak Digital Science™ Image system (Eastman Kodak Co.). PI-specific phospholipase C digestion was performed as described previously (27McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monosaccharide composition of purified LAM fractions and AG in the residual pellet was determined after hydrolysis in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (2 h, 100 °C) followed by conversion of the released monosaccharides to their alditol acetate derivatives by reduction in NaBD4 and acetylation in acetic anhydride using 1-methyl-imidazole as a catalyst (28Henry R.J. Blakeney A.B. Harris P.J. Stone B.A. J. Chromatogr. 1983; 256: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed using a Hewlett Packard 6890 GC fitted with a HP-1 column attached to a Hewlett Packard 5973 mass selective detector. For analysis of alditol acetates, the column was held at 80 °C for 1 min, ramped at 30 °C min–1 to 140 °C and then at 5 °C min–1 to 250 °C, and held at 250 °C for 20 min. Metabolic Labeling—Cells were grown to mid-exponential phase in M9 broth with 1 mm inositol. Cells were washed twice in M9 broth (37 °C) to remove the inositol. The concentrated cells (1:500 of original volume) were pulsed with myo-[2-3H]inositol (50 μCi/ml) for 5 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice again in M9 broth (37 °C) to remove the unincorporated myo-[2-3H]inositol before being resuspended in fresh M9 media (37 °C) with 0 or 1 mm inositol at the same density as when they were harvested. Growth of cultures was monitored by biomass accumulation. Samples were harvested from the cultures during the actively growing periods for analysis of cell wall components. Radiolabeled lipids were detected by fluorography after coating the HPTLC sheets with EA Wax (EA Biotech) and exposure to BioMax MR film (Kodak) at –80 °C or scraped from the HPTLC sheets and label quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Characterization of the M. smegmatis ino1 Mutant—A gene with 87% amino acid identity to the M. tuberculosis ino1 gene was isolated from M. smegmatis. The M. smegmatis homologue was present in an essentially identical loci to the M. tuberculosis ino1 gene (29Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Krogh A. McLean J.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6557) Google Scholar). Specifically, two ORFs of unknown function (Rv0048c and Rv0047c in M. tuberculosis) were located downstream of ino1, whereas another ORF of unknown function, Rv0045c, precedes it. These ORFs have 48–81% amino acid identity to M. smegmatis homologues. The protein encoded by M. smegmatis ino1 had 87% amino acid identity to M. tuberculosis IPS. A M. smegmatis ino1 mutant was generated by targeted disruption of the ino1 gene encoding a putative IPS (Fig. 2A). Colonies of the ino1 mutant were only recovered from M9 agar containing inositol, supporting a role for this gene in inositol metabolism. Disruption of ino1 was confirmed by Southern hybridization (Fig. 2B) and measurement of IPS activity. Whereas wild-type M. smegmatis contained high levels of IPS activity (3.29 ± 0.77 units/mg protein), no IPS activity was detected in the ino1 mutant (<0.01 ± 0.03 unit/mg protein). Finally, complementation of the ino1 mutant with an intact copy of the M. smegmatis ino1 gene on a mycobacterial shuttle vector increased IPS activity to 0.15 ± 0.08 unit/mg protein and restored inositol prototrophy. These data indicate that ino1 encodes the only functional IPS in M. smegmatis and that the ino1 mutant is auxotrophic for inositol. Effect of Inositol Starvation on the Non-replicating ino1 Mutant—Non-replicating stages of the ino1 mutant were highly resistant to inositol starvation. When stationary-phase cells were resuspended in inositol-free medium at high density, culture viability remained constant over 400 h (Fig. 3A). Analysis of the total lipid fraction showed that levels of polar PIMs (AcPIM6/Ac2PIM6) did not decrease over this period, whereas levels of apolar PIMs (AcPIM2/Ac2PIM2) decreased by ∼60% (Fig. 3B). Remarkably, PI was not detectable in stationary-phase ino1 mutant, regardless of whether inositol was present in the medium or not (Fig. 3B). In contrast, wild-type M. smegmatis expresses high levels of PI during stationary growth (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that apolar PIMs are very stable metabolites that are turned over very slowly in non-dividing cells. They also show that in the absence of the endogenous pathway of inositol biosynthesis, stationary-phase M. smegmatis is unable to accumulate PI. A large steady-state pool of PI is thus not essential for the viability of non-dividing M. smegmatis. Effect of Inositol Starvation on Replicating Stages of the ino1 Mutant—To examine whether PI or downstream products were essential for growth of M. smegmatis, stationary-phase ino1 cells were diluted into fresh medium containing 1000 μm inositol, 1 μm inositol, or no inositol. The growth kinetics of the ino1 mutant was indistinguishable from that of wild-type M. smegmatis in the presence of 1000 μm inositol (Fig. 4, A and B; data not shown). In contrast, biomass did not increase substantially (<0.5 log unit), and viability decreased to zero over 200 h when the ino1 mutant was diluted into inositol-free medium (Fig. 4, A and B). Interestingly, ino1 mutant cells remained intact for ∼25 days after loss of viability, as shown by unchanged biomass (Fig. 4A). The ino1 mutant grew slowly in the presence of 1 μm inositol, and the viability of these cultures decreased dramatically after 150 h (Fig. 4, A and B). Aliquots of the ino1 mutant grown in the presence of 1 or 1000 μm inositol were harvested at various time points to determine whether the loss of viability of cultures grown in 1 μm inositol was associated with the loss of specific inositol lipids. PI was detected in inositol-replete cultures during exponential growth phase but decreased to below the level of detection in stationary-phase cultures (Fig. 5A). In contrast, PI never accumulated to detectable levels in either exponential or stationary-phase ino1 cells grown in the presence of 1 μm inositol (Fig. 5A). These data extend the observation made on stationary-phase cells, suggesting that a large pool of PI is not required for either the viability or growth of M. smegmatis. Because wild-type mycobacteria express high levels of PI throughout growth (Fig. 3B), these data also suggest that the ino1 mutant has a reduced capacity to take up inositol in stationary phase and/or an increased dependence on endogenously synthesized inositol for PI biosynthesis. Unlike PI, cellular levels of PIM2 and PIM6 were expressed throughout growth when the ino1 mutant was grown in 1000 μm inositol, with the relative abundance of the diacylated species increasing with culture age (Fig. 5B). However, in the presence of 1 μm inositol, levels of apolar PIM species decreased to below the level of detection within 78 h. Levels of polar PIMs also decreased, but at a slower rate (Fig. 5B). Surprisingly, LAM levels in inositol-deprived ino1 mutant decreased to ∼20% of the level found in the ino1 mutant grown in 1000 μm inositol, but then they remained constant for the remainder of the experiment (Fig. 5C). The initial decrease in LAM levels may reflect the dilution of this component as a result of ongoing cell division (Fig. 4). The fact that apolar and polar PIMs persisted for longer than LAM suggested that most of the PI was redistributed into PIM biosynthesis rather than LAM biosynthesis under inositol-limiting conditions. To investigate whether the loss of polar PIMs was associated with loss of other cell wall components, the ino1 mutant was grown in 1000 or 1 μm inositol, and cells were harvested at the beginning of stationary phase. As shown in Fig. 5, D and E, components of both the outer lipid layer (GPLs) and inner peptidoglycan-AG-mycolic acid complex (AG) were reduced by >90% in inositol-limited cultures. In contrast, cellular levels of cytoplasmic membrane phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cardiolipin were not decreased after inositol starvation (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that the loss of polar PIMs has little effect on the composition of the cytoplasmic membrane but is associated with the catastrophic loss of major cell wall components and cell viability. Relationship between PI and PIM in Actively Dividing Mycobacteria—The affect of inositol starvation on actively dividing mycobacteria was monitored by cultivating the ino1 mutant in 1000 μm inositol and then transferring cells in mid-exponential phase to fresh medium containing either 1000 μm inositol or no inositol at the same cell density. M. smegmatis wild type and the ino1 mutant in 1000 μm inositol medium continued to multiply for 15 h before entering stationary phase (Fig. 6A). Whereas levels of PI decreased by 50% when the ino1 mutant reached stationary phase, cellular levels of other phospholipids and total PIM remained constant throughout exponential and stationary growth (Fig. 7, A and C). Interestingly, levels of diacylated PIM2 and PIM6 in the ino1 mutant (Fig. 7C) and wild type (data not shown) invariably increased at 5 h and subsequently decreased, suggesting that the inositol acylation reaction is reversible. In the absence of exogenous inositol, the actively dividing ino1 mutant underwent ∼3–4 cell divisions before biomass plateaued after ∼15 h and viability decreased after 26 h (Fig. 6B). Inositol starvation led to the rapid decrease in PI (depleted within 3 h) and apolar PIMs (depleted within 5 h) (Fig. 7, B and D) but to a small increase in AcPIM6 levels over 5 h (Fig. 7, B and D). Levels of LM/LAM remained constant during this period (data not shown). These data support the notion that the major cellular pools of PI and PIM2 can be used to sustain polar PIM synthesis during nutrient starvation. They also suggest that dividing cells are more resistant to inositol starvation than stationary-phase cells, by virtue of containing a larger steady-state pool of PI.Fig. 7Alterations in PI and PIM levels in the actively dividing ino1 mutant. The ino1 mutant (mid-exponential phase) was resuspended in M9 medium containing 1000 μm inositol or no inositol and harvested at the indicated time points. A and B, changes in the cellular levels of phospholipids and PIMs were monitored by HPTLC. HPTLC sheets were developed in solvent system 1, and lipids were detected with cupric acetate staining.

To investigate which of these processes predominates under inositol-replete or -limiting conditions, M. smegmatis wild type and the ino1 mutant were pulse-labeled with myo-[3H]inositol and then resuspended in fresh medium containing 1000 μm inositol or no inositol. In wild-type M. smegmatis, label was initially incorporated into PI and subsequently chased into AcPIM2, LAM, and AcPIM6 (Fig. 8, A–D). The efficiency of labeling of the latter species was increased when the chase was performed in inositol-free medium, which appeared to coincide with reduced turnover of labeled PI (Fig. 8, A and C). Regardless of the chase conditions, total incorporation of myo-[3H]inositol into PIM and LAM fractions never exceeded 48–56% of the label initially incorporated into the PI fraction (Fig. 8, B and D). These data suggest that th"

Prior AFM and electron microscopy single molecule studies showed that a cardiac PEVK isoform behaved as a random coil with structural variations that resulted in persistence length values (p) ranging widely between 0.2 and 2.5 nm (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Li H. Linke W.A.

Given that the persistence length of a polypeptide chain determines its elasticity, it was surprising that the values of p varied so much between molecules. In this earlier work, it was proposed that proline content, resulting into individualized mixtures of cis and trans conformations, might account for the broad range of persistence lengths observed. Here we present a study designed to gain a better understanding for the role various exons play in the passive elastic properties of PEVK and whether this is influenced by either proline content alone or rather the overall proline, glutamate, valine, and lysine amino acid content of the PEVK domain. We have used molecular biology techniques to generate three distinct polyprotein chimeras containing PEVK domains encoded by a single exon, fused together with the titin I27 domain. We examined these proteins with single molecule atomic force spectroscopy. The PEVK polyprotein chimera design was essential to unambiguously identify single molecules, a crucial step in correctly measuring the persistence length of the PEVK domains (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F.

Application of the worm-like chain (WLC) fit to our AFM force-extension curves describes the restoring force as a result of stretching the polymer and is given by, F(x)=kTp[14(1−xLc)−2−14+xLc](Eq. 1) where F is the force, x is the extension, p is the persistence length, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in degrees Kelvin, and Lc is the contour length of the polymer. The parameters of p and Lc are measured by fits to the measured force-extension curves (Fig. 1, A–C, and Fig. 2D, thin lines). In the region where the I27 fingerprint unfolds, consecutive fits measure the increase in contour length associated with each unfolding event (ΔLc ∼ 28 nm), which together with the peak unfolding forces, positively identify a single PEVK containing polyprotein.Fig. 2Similar persistence length values found in polypeptides from different PEVK exons.A–C, histograms of the persistence length values, p, measured from polyproteins engineered with PEVK modules from different exons.

Although the two molecules are of similar total contour length, the PEVK extension shows very different persistence lengths (0.38 nm versus 1.93 nm). The boxed gray region is shown in greater detail at the top of the panel.

Li H. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7299-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The force-extension mode of AFM operation has also been recently described (20Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Data collection and control of the AFM head were done by means of data acquisition cards (6052E and 6703, National Instruments, Austin, TX) controlled by software written in IGOR PRO (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Cantilevers used for AFM experiments were Si3N4 levers (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) having spring constants typically in the range of 40–50 pN nm–1 and were calibrated in solution with the equipartition theorem. A pulling speed for all measurements was set to 400 nm/s. Data analysis was done with IGOR PRO. Construction of the [(PEVK)3I27]4 Polyproteins—The method for protein engineering, utilizing successive cycles of BamHI/BglII sticky end ligations, has been described previously (20Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 21Li H.

Polyprotein constructs used in this study were based on the human titin I27 and PEVK sequence (4Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar, 14Freiburg A. Trombitas K. Hell W. Cazorla O. Fougerousse F. Centner T. Kolmerer B. Witt C. Beckmann J.S. Gregorio C.C. Granzier H. Labeit S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1114-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). While the human titin gene contains 116 exons coding for PEVK sequences, we have confined our investigation to exons 120, 161, and 184. All three exons are approximately equal in size (encoding 27, 28, or 30 amino acids, respectively) but contrast in proline as well as overall PEVK content. Specifically exon 120 contains 4 prolines with an overall PEVK content equal to 70%, exon 161 has 2 prolines with an overall PEVK of 55%, and exon 184 has 11 prolines with 87% of its content made up by PEVK amino acids. Thus these three selected exons provide a range of proline and PEVK composition, features that make them ideal to use in an examination of the exon-specific contribution to PEVK flexibility. The core sequence for our polyprotein chimeras was always three identical tandem repeats of a PEVK exon (which we refer to as a single PEVK domain), followed by an I27 module, with the core sequence repeated four times. The finished constructs had the following structure: [(exon120PEVK)3I27]4, [(exon161PEVK)3I27]4, or [(exon184PEVK)3I27]4. Additionally all constructs contained two terminal cysteine-cysteine residues to orient a covalent protein attachment to the gold substrate during AFM experiments (20Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Polyprotein expression in bacteria, as well as protein purification by Ni2+ chelation and size exclusion chromatography, have also been described previously (20Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The polyproteins used in this study were constructed from single PEVK exons and an I27 domain. Because the number of amino acids in the selected PEVK exons is approximately one-third the number of amino acids in the I27 domain (27–30 versus 89 amino acids, respectively), all the chimeric polyproteins were designed to include three repeats of a single PEVK exon linked to I27 as the core sequence, which was repeated 4-fold such that any of our recombinant constructs always contained 12 identical copies of a PEVK exon and four I27 domains. This can be appreciated in the cartoons of Fig. 1, A–C, where three identical PEVK exons are placed in tandem and represented by the green, lavender, and dark blue coiled structures, followed by the β-stranded I27 domain shown in gold, and repeated four times. By engineering such a polyprotein, we were able to confine our analysis to only those AFM force-extension traces in which the well described signature of I27 unfolding was present, namely a contour length increase of ∼28 nm, as well as a peak unfolding force of ∼200 pN (21Li H.

Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Our method of analysis is highlighted in Fig. 1. Panel A in Fig. 1 illustrates a typical force-extension sawtooth pattern trace. In this experiment three I27 unfolding peaks are present, while the last peak represents the detachment of the protein from either the cantilever or the surface. The initial featureless region of the force-extension curve corresponds to the extension of the PEVK domain. We fit this region with the WLC model up to 90 pN, just before the first unfolding peak of the I27 fingerprint (Equation 1; Fig. 1, A–C, thin lavender trace). Following the extension of the PEVK domain, we fit the WLC to the unfolding peaks to identify the I27 fingerprint. We explicitly measure ΔLc per I27 unfolding event by measuring the difference in the contour length between the first and the last unfolding peaks and dividing by the total number of events (20Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). In Fig. 1A we measured ΔLc = 86.4 nm, which divided by three events, gives ΔLc = 28.2 nm per unfolding. This value together with unfolding forces of ∼200 pN defines the mechanical unfolding of three I27 modules (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc.

Fowler S.B. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A single PEVK exon, repeated three times, represents a PEVK domain within our polyprotein of either 81 (exon 120), 84 (exon 161), or 90 (exon 184) amino acids. Since each amino acid contributes 0.38 nm/residue (23Carrion-Vazquez M. Marszalek P.E. Oberhauser A.F. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11288-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), this will result in the extension of each PEVK domain to a contour length of Lc = 30.8, 31.9, or 34.2 nm for exons 120, 161, or 184, respectively. Due to the characteristic lack of mechanical resistance of a random coil, the extension of a PEVK domain will always occur before any I27 unfolding event. A WLC fit to the initial extension observed in the AFM recording from a [(exon120PEVK)3I27]4 polyprotein shown in Fig. 1A measures Lc = 72.5 nm. While the extension of this region is predominantly from the PEVK domain, part of this extension represents a contribution from the three folded I27 modules, ∼4.5 nm/folded I27 domain (22Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1025-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 24Improta S. Krueger J.K. Gautel M. Atkinson R.A. Lefevre J.F. Moulton S. Trewhella J. Pastore A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 761-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and has to be subtracted from the measured Lc. A corrected Lc value of 59 nm is consistent with the extension of two PEVK domains (two exon 120 domains, see above; Lc = 61.6 nm). Hence, in the schematic below the trace in Fig. 1A, the first two PEVK domains, as well as the first I27 domain are opacified given that they do not contribute to the force extension curve. Fig. 1B illustrates four I27 unfolding events preceded by an initial PEVK extension of 93 nm, corresponding to three PEVK domains, while the three I27 unfoldings of Fig. 1C are preceded by an initial PEVK extension of 119 nm corresponding to the extension of all four PEVK domains. Fig. 1D shows a histogram of the peak unfolding force for the I27 fingerprint from all 239 recordings used in our study The mean value of the unfolding force was 196 ± 30 pN (n = 823), which was similar to our prior results (20Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 21Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6527-6531Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). All single molecule traces used in our analysis had to meet the strict criteria outlined above, namely that a regular saw-tooth pattern of I27 unfolding events had to be preceded by a PEVK extension corresponding to integer multiples of a PEVK domain. WLC fits to the PEVK domain (thin lavender lines in Fig. 1, A–C) are done before any I27 module unfolds. The persistence length of a folded I27 polyprotein is large and was measured to be p = 9.8 nm (see supplementary information in Ref. 9Li H. Linke W.A. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M. Kerkvliet J.G. Lu H. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), marking a rigid protein. Furthermore, an individual I27 module is likely to be much stiffer than the I27 polyprotein. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that in the case of the PEVK-I27 polyproteins studied here, I27 modules, prior to their unfolding, do not contribute to the flexibility of the PEVK domains being measured. We were able to collect 60, 94, and 85 single molecule recordings for the PEVK exons 120, 161, and 184, respectively. WLC fits to the initial extension of the [(exon120PEVK)3I27]4 polyprotein (sixty recordings) measured the persistence length shown in the histogram of Fig. 2A. The bin widths are set to 0.15 nm (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the mean value of the measured persistence length for this exon is p = 0.89 ± 0.42 nm. The same wide distribution of persistence length values was observed for the other two PEVK exons. WLC fits to the initial extension of the [(exon161PEVK)3I27]4 polyprotein (94 recordings) gave an average persistence length of p = 0.92 ± 0.38 nm (Fig. 2B), whereas the fits to the [(exon184PEVK)3I27]4 polyprotein (85 recordings) gave an average persistence length of p = 0.98 ± 0.4 nm (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D shows two recordings obtained from [(exon120PEVK)3I27]4 polyproteins, which are similar in length and have the same number of I27 unfolding events (four), yet their PEVK domains show very different values of persistence length (p = 0.38 nm versus p = 1.93 nm). These recordings highlight the variations in the persistence length of the PEVK domains. Of the 363 exons encoding titin, the elastic I-band region is encoded by a total of 251 exons, highlighting the importance of alternative splicing in controlling titin elasticity (2Granzier H.L. Labeit S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). The I-band comprises of 135 exons coding for immunoglobulin domains and unique sequences and there are 116 exons coding for PEVK sequences (2Granzier H.L. Labeit S. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). It is believed that each of the approximately ∼600 striated muscles of the human body will have a unique alternatively spliced form of titin (4Labeit S. Kolmerer B. Science. 1995; 270: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). For example, cardiac titin possesses two extensible regions of unknown structure, the N2B unique region and the PEVK region. The unique cardiac-specific N2B and PEVK regions are 572 and 186 amino acids long, respectively. The mechanical properties of these regions were recently examined by single molecule AFM techniques and were found to behave like extensible random coils (7Watanabe K. Nair P. Labeit D. Kellermayer M.S. Greaser M. Labeit S. Granzier H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11549-11558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D.

Kerkvliet J.G. Lu H. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In contrast to mechanically stable folded proteins like the immunoglobulin domains of titin (20Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), an unstructured protein domain generates a recoiling force that changes monotonically with its length (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This recoiling force is well described by simple models of polymer elasticity, where the flexibility of the chain is defined by the persistence length, p. For unstructured proteins of equal length a higher value of p predicts a lower force at any given extension. Hence we were surprised to find that the persistence length of the cardiac specific PEVK varied widely from molecule to molecule between values of p = 0.3–2.3 nm (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), in sharp contrast with the persistence length of the N2B unique region, which was narrowly distributed around a mean value of p = 0.66 nm (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Li H. Linke W.A.

The wide variations in the persistence length of the cardiac PEVK were attributed to result from the different conformations of its proline residues. Such conformations were thought to be the result of polyproline type I (cis) and type II (trans) helical structures (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and the two allowed conformations of the trans prolyl residues (25Schimmel P.R. Flory P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Extrapolating from these results, we proposed that the proline content encoded into each of the 116 PEVK exons would result into modular flexibility cassettes that through alternative splicing, tune the elasticity of a given myofibril. In a more recent study, Granzier and colleagues used protein engineering and single molecule AFM techniques to measure the persistence length of multi-exon PEVK constructs (18Labeit D. Watanabe K. Witt C. Fujita H. Wu Y. Lahmers S. Funck T. Labeit S. Granzier H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). They showed a histogram of the measured persistence length for a PEVK protein encompassing exons 119 to 136. These combined PEVK exons showed a wide persistence length distribution, p = 0.3–2.7 nm, which was very similar to the cardiac specific PEVK. Hence, these experiments did not resolve the question of whether individual exons code for protein sequences with well defined and narrowly distributed persistence length values. The experiments that we report here were designed to test the “flexibility cassette” hypothesis. We engineered polyproteins that contained multiple repeats of a single PEVK exon, combined with an unfolding fingerprint used to identify single molecules (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Li H. Linke W.A. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M.

Labeit S. Granzier H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). For our study, we chose the PEVK exons 161, 120, and 184, which contained 7, 14, and 37% proline, respectively. This range covered the proline content found in the cardiac titin N2B unique (7%) and cardiac PEVK (23%) sequences. In contrast to our expectations, we found that in all three cases the persistence length values were distributed broadly, p = 0.26–2 nm, similar to all prior multi-exon single molecule measurements of PEVK protein flexibility (8Li H. Oberhauser A.F. Redick S.D. Carrion-Vazquez M. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10682-10686Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Li H. Linke W.A.

Given that there are still 113 exons to be examined at the single exon level with single molecule techniques, we cannot rule out the existence of persistence length distributions that are exon-specific. However, our current data does not support the flexibility cassette hypothesis for PEVK exons. Alternatively, the diversity of PEVK exons may simply represent a strategy for the fine length adjustment of a random coil-like protein, without ever repeating the same sequence. In this scenario, all PEVK proteins would show the same range of persistence length values, in agreement with the current literature and our latest observations (Fig. 3). It is still possible that the single molecule AFM approach blurs the true values of the persistence length of PEVK. A possible explanation for the broad distribution in persistence lengths is that, in contrast to other proteins, PEVK proteins can accumulate torsional strain. In addition to their persistence length, molecules such as DNA show torsional stiffness (twist persistence length), which affects their flexibility (26Nelson P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14342-14347Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). When single molecules are picked up by an AFM tip, they will extend by uncoiling from their resting conformation. While relaxed on the surface, different proteins will have varying degrees of coiling, which upon extending will result into different amounts of torsion for each molecule. If PEVK proteins can accumulate this torsional strain, their persistence length would vary over wide ranges. However, the ability of proteins to store torsional strain has not yet been measured. We thank Drs. H. Li and A. S. R. Koti and R. B. Robertson for their help."

This assay can detect ligand binding to proteins of unknown function. The recombinant protein was found to be in a dimeric, native-like folded state and to unfold cooperatively. ThermoFluor was used to screen the protein against a library of 3000 compounds that were specifically selected to provide information about possible biological functions. The results of this screen identified pyridoxal phosphate and pyridoxamine phosphate as equilibrium binding ligands (Kd ∼ 50 pm, Kd ∼ 2.5 μm, respectively), consistent with an enzymatic cofactor function. Several nucleotides and nucleotide sugars were also identified as ligands of this protein. Sequence comparison with two enzymes of known structure but relatively low overall sequence homology established that several key residues directly involved in pyridoxal phosphate binding were strictly conserved. Screening a collection of generic drugs and natural products identified the antifungal compound canescin A as an irreversible covalent modifier of the enzyme. Our investigation of this protein indicates that its probable biological role is that of a nucleoside diphospho-keto-sugar aminotransferase, although the preferred keto-sugar substrate remains unknown.

These experiments demonstrate the utility of a generic affinity-based ligand binding technology in decrypting possible biological functions of a protein, an approach that is both independent of and complementary to existing genomic and proteomic technologies. It is estimated that 40–60% of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes have unknown or tentatively assigned biological functions (1Yakunin A.F. Yee A.A. Savchenko A. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The protein products encoded by these genes are potentially valuable targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, understanding the functions of previously uncharacterized bacterial proteins could lead to the development of new classes of antibiotics (2Chan P.F. Macarron R. Payne D.J. Zalacain M. Holmes D.J. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2002; 2: 291-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such antibiotics are urgently needed for treating the growing number of bacterial strains resistant to currently available therapies. The advent of new tools for proteomics and bioinformatics has facilitated the identification of protein function, achieved through classification of functional domains, patterns of expression, and binding partners. These tools are essential for defining biological function in a cellular context. The majority of known microbial drug targets contain sites of interaction with low-molecular weight ligands, for example, cofactors and metabolites. Discovering and understanding these “drug-able” sites on new proteins is of vital importance (3Strausberg R.L. Schreiber S.L. Science. 2003; 300: 294-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Sequence data alone is often insufficient to describe the molecular functions of proteins and their sites of interaction with small molecules. Even when tentative assignment of molecular function is possible, biochemical characterization of the expressed protein product is essential to confirm and elaborate function. High throughput biochemical methods have been developed to address this need and take full advantage of the vast quantities of biochemical data in commercial data bases. For example, chemically reactive probes have been used to study multiple members of a family of enzymes (4Adam G.C. Sorensen E.J. Cravatt B.F. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 781-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Affinity-based screening of ligands immobilized in microarrays has been employed to identify small molecule binding partners of proteins (5MacBeath G. Koehler A.N. Schreiber S.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 7967-7968Crossref Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Other affinity-based technologies such as surface plasmon resonance and capillary electrophoresis have also been used to study small molecule binding when protein function is unknown (6Williams C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2000; 11: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The utility of many methods is limited by their requirement for covalent modification of the target protein and/or the use of libraries of specialized molecules that may not be representative of the vast diversity of biochemical space. For screening using any available sample of soluble expressed protein and any commonly accessible chemical library, we have developed an affinity-based screening technology, ThermoFluor® (7Pantoliano M.W. Petrella E.C. Kwasnoski J.D. Lobanov V.S. Myslik J. Graf E. Carver T. Asel E. Springer B.A. Lane P. Salemme F.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2001; 6: 429-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ThermoFluor measures the enhanced thermal stability conferred by the binding of ligands to the native state of proteins and is readily adaptable to high-throughput screening in 384-well plates. No knowledge of substrates or binding partners is required to detect binding in ThermoFluor, a feature that renders it ideal for characterizing the binding of biological ligands to proteins of unknown function. In this work, we have screened CFE97 1The abbreviations used are: CFE97, cloned for expression protein 97; Dpx, dapoxyl sulfuric acid; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; CCD, charge coupled device; AHBA, 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; PMP, pyridoxamine phosphate; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. from Streptococcus pneumoniae (8Thanassi J.A. Hartman-Neumann S.L. Dougherty T.J. Dougherty B.A. Pucci M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3152-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), a protein of unknown function, against a functional probe library comprising commercially available biomolecules. In an earlier study, 113 genes were shown to be essential for growth of S. pneumoniae using targeted gene disruption (8Thanassi J.A. Hartman-Neumann S.L. Dougherty T.J. Dougherty B.A. Pucci M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3152-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These genes were selected to have a significant level of homology to related genes from at least two of four other bacterial species (40% global amino acid sequence identity to genes found in Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli,or Staphylococcus epidermis) (8Thanassi J.A. Hartman-Neumann S.L. Dougherty T.J. Dougherty B.A. Pucci M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3152-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar)). A number of these genes have unknown or poorly characterized functions. One of these orphan proteins, CFE97, the protein product of gene sp1837 from S. pneumoniae, was cloned, expressed, purified, and screened using ThermoFluor. Information obtained from the screening hits enabled further biochemical characterization of the target, as well as the design of biochemical assays tailored to the putative function of CFE97. The results of these experiments, in combination with comparative analyses of the protein sequence, provide a clearer picture of the possible biochemical functions of CFE97. Materials—All materials were of the highest available quality and were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Canescin A was obtained from Microsource (Gaylordsville, CT) and Dpx was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Protein—The sp1837 gene was inserted into a pET vector with a His6 tag as described previously (8Thanassi J.A. Hartman-Neumann S.L. Dougherty T.J. Dougherty B.A. Pucci M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3152-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The plasmid was transformed into the BL21(DE3) pLys-S expression strain of E. coli (Novagen) and 2 liters of culture were grown. The cell paste was lysed using the Rannie homogenizer and the supernatant from ultracentrifugation of the lysate was filtered through a 1.2-μm filter. The filtrate was loaded onto an 80-ml Ni-MCC (Pharmacia Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow) column, and the protein was eluted with a 25–500 mm imidazole gradient. Fractions were pooled based upon protein amount and purity in SDS-PAGE. The final purification step was an Amersham Biosciences Superdex-200 (26/60) size exclusion column with a running buffer of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The final protein was >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE using a 4–20% Tris glycine gel. Description of the ThermoFluor Assay—The ThermoFluor assay was performed as described previously (7Pantoliano M.W. Petrella E.C. Kwasnoski J.D. Lobanov V.S. Myslik J. Graf E. Carver T. Asel E. Springer B.A. Lane P. Salemme F.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2001; 6: 429-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using instrumentation built at 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals. 2The ThermoFluor assay was developed by 3-Dimensional Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was merged into Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, L.L.C. “ThermoFluor” is a registered trademark in the United States and certain other countries. The protein (2 μl at 2 μm in 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 100 μm Dpx) was dispensed into black Abgene polypropylene ThermoFast-384 plates (Epsom, UK) containing an equal volume of test compound in either water or 4% Me2SO. Wells contained 4 μl (protein + compound) and were overlaid with 1 μl of polydimethylsiloxane DC200 oil (Sigma) to prevent evaporation. For each plate, the temperature was increased from 30 to 75 °C in 1 °C increments. At each temperature the plates were equilibrated for 3 min and then rapidly cooled to 25 °C, after which four images were recorded using a 12-bit, cooled CCD camera (10 s exposure time). An average intensity per well was calculated by integrating pixel intensities per well and averaging the four exposures. Approximately 3000 compounds comprising the functional probe library (contents described below) were screened against CFE97, at a concentration between 10 μm and 1 mm (compound dependent). Analysis of Ligand Binding Using ThermoFluor—The analysis of protein unfolding curves and the derivation of equilibrium binding constants has been described in detail elsewhere (7Pantoliano M.W. Petrella E.C. Kwasnoski J.D. Lobanov V.S. Myslik J. Graf E. Carver T. Asel E. Springer B.A. Lane P. Salemme F.R. J. Biomol. Screen. 2001; 6: 429-440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Matulis D. Kranz J.K. Salemme F.R. Todd M. Biochemistry. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the temperature dependence of the increase in fluorescence because of protein denaturation, y(T), can be described by the following equation, Keq=e−ΔUGTRT=e−(ΔUHTr+ΔUCp(T−Tr)−T(ΔUSTr+ΔUCplnTTr))RT(Eq. 1) where yf is fluorescence intensity when protein is folded (native), yu is fluorescence intensity when protein is non-native, and the exponential represents the probability of a protein with unfolding free energy ΔUG(T) being folded. The midpoint of the unfolding is defined as the Tm. The equilibrium constant for unfolding (Keq) is temperature-dependent, as given by the following expression (10Brandts J.F. Hu C.Q. Lin L.N. Mos M.T. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8588-8596Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 11Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6927-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), Keq=e−ΔUGTRT=e−(ΔUHTr+ΔUCp(T−Tr)−T(ΔUSTr+ΔUCplnTTr))RT(Eq. 2) where ΔUG(Tr), ΔUHTr, and ΔUSTr are the Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of protein unfolding, respectively, at a reference temperature taken to be Tm. The thermal stability at any temperature, T, can be calculated from the expected change of each thermodynamic parameter relative to a reference temperature, Tr, using standard equations (Equation 2) that include the heat capacity of protein unfolding, ΔUCp, which is assumed to be temperature independent. The equilibrium constant for ligand binding (Kb) at any temperature can be calculated from its value at a reference temperature by a similar function, Kb=e−ΔbGTRT=e−(ΔbHT−TΔbST)RT=e−(ΔbHT0+ΔbCp(T−T0)−T(ΔbST0+ΔbCplnTT0))RT(Eq. 3) where ΔbGT, ΔbHT, ΔbST, and ΔbCp are, respectively, Gibbs free energy, enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity of ligand binding at any temperature, T, relative to that at a reference temperature, T0 (again, the heat capacity is assumed to be temperature independent). For protein unfolding, the reference temperature was set to the Tm in the absence of added ligand; for ligand binding, the reference temperature was 37 °C. All reported binding affinities were measured at Tm and then extrapolated to 37 °C, assuming ΔbHT0=37 °C ∼ -5 kcal mol and ΔbCp ∼ -250 cal mol-1 K-1. The accuracy of Tm as determined across 384 identical melts was ±0.2 °C; ligand induced changes in thermal stability greater than 0.4 °C were considered significant. The above expressions for Keq and Kb can be combined to calculate the effect of ligand concentration on the observed protein Tm using the following equation, Lt=(1−Keq)(Pt2+1KeqKb)(Eq. 4) where Lt is the total ligand concentration (free + bound), and Pt is the total protein concentration (free + bound) (9Matulis D. Kranz J.K. Salemme F.R. Todd M. Biochemistry. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding affinity, Kb, was determined by measuring the effect of varying ligand concentrations on protein Tm (9Matulis D. Kranz J.K. Salemme F.R. Todd M. Biochemistry. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Compound was serially diluted in either aqueous buffer or Me2SO. These dilutions were mixed with protein and dye in the assay buffer, and the Tm was measured at each compound concentration, as described above. In cases where ligand binding was found to be reversible, the plot of Tm versus ligand concentration was simulated using Equation 4 by fitting unfolding curves to Equation 1 to obtain an observed Tm and comparing these values to curves simulated by inserting different values of Kb into Equation 4. Composition of the Functional Probe Library—The functional probe library comprised a proprietary set of molecules selected from four general classes of compounds: known bioactive molecules (substrates, cofactors, and receptor ligands), generic drugs, natural products, and compounds that are inhibitors or antagonists of biological reactions and interactions. Portions of this library were purchased in plates from vendors; the remainder consisted of compounds that were purchased individually and assembled into plates based upon annotations in data bases of biological ligands (e.g. BRENDA (12Schomburg I. Chang A. Ebeling C. Gremse M. Heldt C. Huhn G. Schomburg D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: D431-D433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The assembled library was dispensed into 384-well plates as concentrated stock solutions in Me2SO or water, and the plates were stored at -80 °C. Absorbance Measurements and Assays—A Hewlett Packard model 8453 diode-array spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was use to record absorbance spectra using 100-μl quartz cuvettes (1-cm path length). Protein was dialyzed exhaustively to remove excess cofactor prior to the analyses shown in Fig. 6A. Initial velocities for the half-reaction in which pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is converted into pyridoxamine phosphate (PMP) were calculated from the increase in absorbance at 330 nm versus time using a Tecan Safire plate reader at 37 °C. Reactions (25 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 μm PLP plus 0–10 mm amino acid) were initiated by adding enzyme (to 5 μm) and the appearance of PMP was monitored for 90 min. Initial rates were calculated during the linear portion of the assay, and kinetic constants were determined using double-reciprocal plots. Biophysical Characterization of CFE97—Purified CFE97 (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) was characterized by several biophysical techniques. Helicity of purified protein was estimated by circular dichroism (CD model 202, Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ), using protein desalted into 25 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0. The CD spectrum indicated that CFE97 contained a considerable amount of α-helix as judged by minima near 208 and 222 nm. The temperature dependence of the CD signal showed a marked decrease in ellipticity on heating, with a Tm near 50 °C. Sedimentation equilibrium data were measured on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge at 20 °C. Samples were centrifuged until equilibrium was attained, as judged by an unchanging absorbance versus radial position profile. The data were analyzed with either a single homogeneous species model or a monomer-dimer model as described previously (13Doyle M.L. Tian S.S. Miller S.G. Kessler L. Baker A.E. Brigham-Burke M.R. Dillon S.B. Duffy K.J. Keenan R.M. Lehr R. Rosen J. Schneeweis L.A. Trill J. Young P.R. Luengo J.I. Lamb P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9426-9434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Buffer density was 1.00499 g ml-1 and the partial specific volume was 0.7392 ml g-1. The enthalpy of protein unfolding was measured using differential scanning calorimetry (VP-DSC, MicroCal, L.L.C., Northampton, MA). Protein was desalted into 25 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, using a PD-10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the same buffer. Degassed protein at 0.4 mg/ml was loaded into a thoroughly washed, thermally conditioned calorimeter cell. Differential excess enthalpy in the protein cell versus an exact buffer match in the reference cell was monitored as the temperature was ramped (10 to 90 °C, at 1 °C/min). Mass Spectrometry—Protein samples were incubated alone or with a 10-fold molar excess of PLP or canescin A. Following incubation, samples were dialyzed in PIPES buffer to remove excess compound, desalted into 70% acetonitrile/water (v/v), and injected onto a Micromass Q-Tof® mass spectrometer. Mass was determined using electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. Data were analyzed using the formula ((m/z) · z) - z = mass, where m/z is a mass to charge ratio given by the instrument for a peak and z is an estimated charge. Given the correct charge estimate, all peaks will arrive at the same mass ± 0.01%. Analysis of the Oligomeric State of CFE97—For orphan proteins, by definition, there is no function-based standard by which to evaluate the state of the protein in solution. It is therefore important to determine whether the expressed protein is in a homogeneous state consistent with native, folded protein. Equilibria between intermediates on a protein unfolding pathway can complicate protein melting curves, and the interpretation of ligand effects on stability. Thus it is standard practice to undertake a thorough biophysical characterization of the target protein prior to any ThermoFluor screening. In the case of an unknown protein the biophysical data may also be useful in decryption of function. Although purified CFE97 showed significant α-helicity by circular dichroism and no apparent light scattering, a discrepancy in the native molecular weight was seen when comparing results obtained with different measurements. Analytical size exclusion chromatography of the purified CFE97 protein yielded a homogeneous elution profile indicating an apparent mass of 41 kDa when compared with a series of protein standards, consistent with a monomeric form of the protein (expected molecular mass is 46.6 kDa, based on sequence). However, dynamic light scattering analysis yielded an apparent mass of 93 kDa, suggesting CFE97 was present as a dimer. To resolve this discrepancy, we conducted analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. Fig. 1 shows sedimentation equilibrium data for CFE97 conducted at several rotor speeds. Global analysis of the data to a single species model gave an average mass of 91 kDa, which clearly demonstrated that CFE97 is predominantly a dimer at micromolar concentrations. However, a slightly better global fit was obtained to the multiple rotor speeds data with a monomer-dimer model, yielding a dimerization equilibrium constant of 300 nm. Sedimentation velocity experiments were also conducted with CFE97 at 1.0, 0.3, and 0.1 mg/ml. At each of these concentrations the protein sedimented as a single species with a sedimentation coefficient of ∼4.5 S and no detectable aggregate (data not shown). The thermal stability of CFE97 was measured using differential scanning calorimetry in the presence and absence of environmentally sensitive dyes used in ThermoFluor experiments (Fig. 2). In the absence of hydrophobic dye, the thermogram shows a single cooperative unfolding unit. Thermal stability decreased ∼1 °C in the presence of dye, consistent with dye interacting specifically with non-native protein. DSC curves could be simulated by a monomeric equilibrium unfolding model; however, a better fit to the data was obtained assuming a monomer-dimer equilibrium unfolding model (14Todd M.J. Semo N. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), where folded dimer is in equilibrium with unfolded monomer. These latter fits are shown in Fig. 2, with fit thermodynamic parameters listed in Table I. Thus, the results of several distinct analyses indicate that CFE97 exists as a dimer in solution. A ΔUHTm of 80 kcal mol-1 and a ΔUCp of 3000 kcal mol-1 K-1 were used in Equations 2 and 4 to interpret the concentration effect of ligands on Tm (below).Table IThermodynamic parameters for CFE97 unfoldingParameterValue no Me2SOValue + Dpx + Me2SOa50 μm Dpx, 2% Me2SOMonomeric unfolding modelTm49.2 °CΔUHTm163 kcal mol-1ΔUCp6 kcal mol-1 K-1Dimeric unfolding modelbUsing dimeric unfolding models, the fit Tm (defined as where ΔUGTm = 0) is dependent on protein concentration.

Of ∼3000 compounds tested, 55 reproducibly increased the midpoint transition temperature by an amount ≥1 °C; a subset of these is shown in Table II.Table IISelected hits from a ThermoFluor screen of the functional probe library against CFE97 Open table in a new tab A potent and informative hit discovered in the screening panel was PLP, which increased the Tm of CFE97 by 25 °C. PLP is a cofactor for several classes of enzymes including aminotransferases, decarboxylases, and dehydratases, and the genes for these enzymes constitute as much as 1.5% of bacterial genomes (15John R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these enzymes typically exist as homodimers or some other dihedrally symmetric polymeric form (16Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The PLP binding site comprises elements from both halves of the dimer (16Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Our biophysical characterization of CFE97 as a dimer is thus consistent with the biochemical relevance of the observed PLP binding. PLP forms a specific Schiff base with an active site lysine in enzymes for which it is a cofactor (17Toney M.D. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1471-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The occurrence of pyrroloquinoline quinone as a ligand (Table II) may reflect specific Schiff base formation with the same reactive lysine residue utilized by PLP, or nonspecific protein labeling. Pyrroloquinoline quinone is an amine-reactive quinone that, in addition to serving as an essential enzyme co-factor in some Gram-negative bacteria (18Klinman J.P. Mu D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 299-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), has been found to bind to pyridoxal-dependent enzymes, although the significance and details of these interactions are not clear (19Choi S.Y. Khemlani L.S. Churchich J.E. Biofactors. 1992; 3: 191-196PubMed Google Scholar). In our initial characterization of this screening hit we observed atypical closing behavior (e.g. interference, nonspecific binding; not shown), and this lead was not pursued further. Many of the remaining hits generally occupy one of three categories: nucleotide-like (purines or pyrimidines), those resembling a sugar moiety, and other molecules. Characterization of Pyridoxal Phosphate and Pyridoxamine Binding—The identification of PLP as a ligand in the screen prompted us to conduct additional studies to characterize its binding to CFE97. Fig. 3A shows the thermal transitions measured using ThermoFluor in the presence and absence of 75 μm PLP or PMP. PLP shifts the midpoint in the unfolding transition from 48 to 73 °C, an increase of 25 °C, consistent with tight binding of this potential co-factor; PMP under the same conditions increased the Tm by 5 °C. The weaker but nevertheless significant affinity of CFE97 for PMP is consistent with a co-factor role for PLP/PMP. The concentration dependence of Tm as a function of PLP and PMP was simulated using Equation 4 with calorimetrically determined ΔUHTm and ΔUCp values (Table I). The effect of ligand concentration on Tm is not only highly dependent on these thermodynamic parameters (9Matulis D. Kranz J.K. Salemme F.R. Todd M. Biochemistry. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) but is also model dependent. Equation 4 assumes a binding stoichiometry of one ligand bound per homodimer. A much better description of the dependence of Tm on ligand concentration was achieved using values for unfolding energetics equal to half of those measured, as might be expected if each homodimer bound two PLP molecules. These latter simulations, yielding Kd estimates of 50 pm (PLP) and 2.5 μm (PMP), are shown in Fig. 3B. The difference in the binding affinities of the two forms of the co-factor is probably because of additional stabilization energy conferred by Schiff base formation upon binding of PLP. The shape of the PLP titration curve, in which the Tm continuously increases and fails to plateau even at the highest PLP concentrations, is consistent with reversible covalent binding (9Matulis D. Kranz J.K. Salemme F.R. Todd M. Biochemistry. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry measurements for CFE97 treated with 1 mm PLP, then dialyzed, did not reveal an increase in molecular weight, confirming reversibility. The thermal stabilities of more than 20 other proteins have been measured in the presence and absence of PLP, and no instances of nonspecific, high-affinity PLP binding have been observed in these control studies. The binding of PMP, although weaker than that of PLP, is likely because of a specific interaction with the protein at the pyridoxal binding site. Taken together, these results suggest that the interaction between PLP/PMP and CFE97 is specific and may reflect a requirement for enzymatic function. Canescin A Binding—Another apparently tight-binding ligand detected in the ThermoFluor screen was canescin A, a natural product that inhibits fungal growth by an unknown mechanism (Table II) (20Angawi R.F. Swenson D.C. Gloer J.B. Wicklow D.T. J. Nat. Prod. 2003; 66: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This compound is one of the substances in the functional probe library, such as natural products and generic drugs, that have biological activity for which the target of interaction is not precisely known. For such compounds, ThermoFluor can b"

In addition, the vaccinia virus carrying the human MBP gene was shown to exhibit potent growth inhibitory activity toward human colorectal carcinoma, SW1116, cells in nude mice. We have proposed calling this activity MBP-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (MDCC) (Ma, Y., Uemura, K., Oka, S., Kozutsumi, Y., Kawasaki, N., and Kawasaki, T. (1999) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 96, 371–375). In this study, the MBP ligands on the surface of SW1116 cells were characterized. Initial experiments involving plant lectins and anti-Lewis antibodies as inhibitors of MBP binding to SW1116 cells indicated that fucose plays a crucial role in the interaction. Subsequently, Pronase glycopeptides were prepared from whole cell lysates, and oligosaccharides were liberated by hydrazinolysis. After being tagged by pyridylamination, MBP ligand oligosaccharides were isolated with an MBP affinity column, and then their sequences were determined by mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry after permethylation, in combination with endo-β-galactosidase digestion and chemical defucosylation. The MBP ligands were shown to be large, multiantennary N-glycans carrying a highly fucosylated polylactosamine type structure. At the nonreducing termini, Leb/Lea or tandem repeats of the Lea structure prevail, a substantial proportion of which are attached via internal Lex or N-acetyllactosamine units to the trimannosyl core. The structures characterized are unique and distinct from those of other previously reported tumor-specific carbohydrate antigens. It is concluded that MBP requires clusters of tandem repeats of the Leb/Lea epitope for recognition.

Human MBP is a homo-oligomer of an ∼31-kDa subunit, each subunit containing a carbohydrate recognition domain followed by a short neck region on the COOH-terminal side and a collagen-like domain followed by a short cysteine-rich region on the NH2-terminal side. Three subunits form a structural unit, and MBP normally consists of two to six structural units joined through disulfide bonds at the amino termini, the whole molecular mass being ∼200–600 kDa (5Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Yokota Y. Arai Y. Kawasaki T. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The carbohydrate specificity of MBP is rather broad (it binds to mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, and fucose) in accordance with the fact that MBP binds to the cell surfaces of a wide variety of pathogens (7Jack D.L. Turner M.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 753-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 8Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). MBP exhibits complement-dependent bactericidal activity, i.e. the Escherichia coli K12 and B strains, which have exposed N-acetylglucosamine and l-glycero-d-mannoheptose residues, respectively, are killed by MBP with the aid of complement (8Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In addition, 1-deoxymannojirimycin (an α-mannosidase inhibitor)-treated baby hamster kidney cells, which have high mannose type oligosaccharides exposed on their surfaces, are also killed by MBP with the aid of complement (9Ohta M. Kawasaki T. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This complement activation pathway is called the lectin pathway (10Malhotra R. Lu J. Holmskov U. Sim R.B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1994; 97: 4-9PubMed Google Scholar). MBP has also been shown to function as a direct opsonin (11Kuhlman M. Joiner K. Ezekowitz R.A. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1733-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) and to prevent virus infection (12Hartley C.A. Jackson D.C. Anders E.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4358-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hart M.L. Saifuddin M. Uemura K. Bremer E.G. Hooker B. Kawasaki T. Spear G.T. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2002; 18: 1311-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, normal mammalian cells such as circulating blood cells did not bind MBP, probably because the surfaces of such mammalian cells are mostly covered with complex type sugar chains terminating in sialic acids and rarely with high mannose type sugar chains (14Uemura K. Yokota Y. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4581-4584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, malignant transformation or viral infections modify the oligosaccharide structures on cell surfaces, and aberrant glycosylation exhibited by glycolipids and glycoproteins in tumors has been implicated as an essential mechanism defining the stage, direction, and end result of tumor progression (15Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar). Along the same lines, we found that MBP recognizes and binds specifically to the surface of human colorectal carcinoma, SW1116, cells. More interestingly, the recombinant vaccinia virus carrying the human MBP gene was demonstrated to exhibit potent growth inhibitory activity toward human colorectal carcinoma cells transplanted into KSN nude mice, when administered by intratumoral or subcutaneous injection (16Ma Y. Uemura K. Oka S. Kozutsumi Y. Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of MBP-mediated tumor growth inhibition has not been clearly elucidated, we have proposed calling this activity MBP-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, several other human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines have also been shown to bind MBP carbohydrate-dependently (17Muto S. Sakuma K. Taniguchi A. Matsumoto K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1999; 22: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, to elucidate the mechanism of MBP-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we tried to characterize the MBP ligands on the surface of SW1116 cells. The binding of the ligands to MBP is believed to be the initial signal step leading to the growth inhibition of the tumor cells. Initial hapten inhibition experiments involving various plant lectins and Lewis blood group type monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as inhibitors of MBP-binding to SW1116 cells indicated that fucose plays an important role in the interaction. Subsequent isolation of the PA-tagged oligosaccharides ligands with an MBP-affinity column, followed by MS analysis of the ligands revealed that MBP ligands on SW1116 cells are N-glycans with highly fucosylated polylactosamine type structures and large molecular sizes.

MBP was purified from normal rabbit serum (Pel-Freez Biologicals, Inc. (AR)) using an affinity column of Sepharose 4B-mannan, as described previously (18Kawasaki N. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biochem. 1983; 94: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). For the preparation of MBP-Sepharose 4B, rabbit serum MBP (3–5 mg of protein/ml of gel) was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human colorectal carcinoma cell line, SW1116 cells, was maintained by serial passages in Leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and incubation at 37 °C with free gas exchange with atmospheric air in a standard tissue culture incubator. FITC-labeled MBP (FITC-MBP) was prepared by conjugating the purified rabbit serum MBP with FITC (100 μg/1 mg of MBP) in 50 mm borate buffer, pH 9.2, containing 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm CaCl2, and 100 mm mannose for 18 h at 4 °C. FITC-labeled anti-Lewis mAbs (except for the FITC-labeled anti-Lex mAb) were prepared as described for the preparation of FITC-MBP in 50 mm borate buffer, pH 9.2, containing 200 mm NaCl. Reseeded SW1116 cells (5 × 106 cells/75 cm2 flask) were grown in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS at 37 °C for 4–5 days. After washing with PBS (–), the cells were released from the flask by incubation with trypsin-EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C. The released cells (1–1.5 × 106 cells/ml) were dispersed as a homogeneous suspension in buffer A by thorough pipetting. Approximately 1.5 × 106 cells were washed twice with buffer B and then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (–) for 30 min at room temperature. After being rinsed once with buffer C and then twice with buffer D (for staining with FITC-MBP, FITC-plant lectins, and FITC-mAbs) or buffer E (as a negative control for FITC-MBP staining), the fixed cells were incubated with 1.5 μg of each FITC-anti-Lewis mAb in a final volume of 150 μl of buffer D or 2 μg of FITC-MBP or FITC-plant lectins in 100 μl of buffer D (or buffer E, for the negative control for FITC-MBP staining) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the cells twice with buffer D or buffer E, followed by once with buffer D, the cells were suspended in 1.0 ml of buffer D and then cell staining was analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer with CELL Quest software (BD Biosciences). Cells (1.5 × 106 cells) fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (–) as above were washed twice and then preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with 30 μg of protein each of various unlabeled plant lectins, or 30 and 140 μg of protein of unlabeled anti-Lewis mAbs or isotype control immunoglobulins of the respective mAbs, in 150 μl of buffer C or buffer D (as a negative control for FITC-MBP staining). To each of these suspensions, 3 μg of FITC-labeled MBP was added followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the cells twice with buffer D or buffer E, followed by once with buffer D, the cells (1.0 × 106) were suspended in 1.0 ml of buffer D, and then cell staining was analyzed with a flow cytometer as above. SW1116 cells were grown in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS with free gas exchange with atmospheric air at 37 °C for 10 days when the cell density reached 70–80% confluence (approximately 3.5 × 107 cells/175-cm2 culture flask). After rinsing once with PBS (–), the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in 15 ml of a mixed medium consisting of 98% RPMI 1640 medium without glucose and 2% Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Then, 1.85 MBq of d-[1-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride dissolved in 50 μl of TBS and 1.65 mg of sodium pyruvate in 150 μl of TBS were added to the medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. 3H radioactivity was determined with a liquid scintillation counter (model LSC3000; ALOKA Co., Ltd., Tokyo). SW1116 cells were grown in Leibovitz's L-15 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS at 37 °C for 2–3 weeks until they reached confluence through two to five passages. After rinsing the flasks once with PBS (–) containing 2 mm EDTA and twice with buffer B, the cells were removed from the flasks with cell scrapers and collected by centrifugation. The cells were washed three times with 150 mm NaCl and then homogenized in a glass-made Dounce type homogenizer (tight pestle; Wheaton Science Products) in buffer C containing 1% Triton X-100 (approximately 1 × 107 cells/ml) on ice. The homogenates were left on ice for 1 h and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatants were stored as the cell lysates at –80 °C. SW1116 cell lysates were thawed and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the resulting supernatants were heated at 100 °C for 7 min and then lyophilized. The dried cell lysates were extracted three times with 80% ethanol followed by once with 100% ethanol and chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and chloroform/methanol/H2O (1:2:0.8, v/v/v), respectively, to remove lipids. The delipidated residues were lyophilized and digested with Pronase (sample/enzyme, 50:1 by weight) in 5.0 ml of 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm (CH3CO)2Ca for 72 h at 37 °C under a layer of toluene. During the digestion, Pronase (1/100 of the starting sample weight) was added to the incubation mixture at 24 and 48 h, respectively. The digest was centrifuged to separate a clear supernatant solution from the insoluble materials. The insoluble materials were digested again with Pronase (1/100 of the starting sample weight) for 72 h with the addition of the same amount of Pronase at 25 and 48 h, respectively. The digest was centrifuged to obtain a clear supernatant. The two clear supernatant fractions obtained after the first and second digestions were combined and lyophilized. The sample was dissolved in buffer F and then applied to a Bio-Gel P4 column (1.9 × 98 cm), which had been equilibrated with buffer F. The flow-through fraction was collected and lyophilized. The fraction was digested again with 1/100 of the starting sample weight of Pronase in 2.0 ml of 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm (CH3CO)2Ca for 72 h at 37 °C, with the addition of 1/200 of the starting sample weight of Pronase at 24 and 48 h, respectively. To the digest, trichloroacetic acid was added to a final concentration of 10%, and then the digest was left standing on ice for 30 min. The precipitate generated was centrifuged off at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the resultant clear supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of aqueous saturated diethyl ether to extract the trichloroacetic acid. The extraction was repeated twice more. The aqueous phase was neutralized with ammonium bicarbonate, concentrated with a SpeedVac, and then applied to a Bio-Gel P4 column (1.9 × 98 cm). The flow-through fraction was collected as the crude glycopeptide fraction. The glycopeptide fraction was purified further on a Bio-Gel P10 column (1.9 × 100 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer F. The glycopeptide fraction was lyophilized, dried in a vacuum desiccator over P2O5 for 72 h and then subjected to gas phase hydrazinolysis at 110 °C for 1 h in Hydraclub S-204 (J-OIL Mills, Inc.) to release the oligosaccharides. The released oligosaccharides were N-acetylated according to the manufacturer's instructions (J-OIL Mills, Inc.), the pH value of the N-acetylated sample solution was adjusted to 3, and then the sample was applied to a Dowex 50-X8 column. The flow-through oligosaccharide fraction from the resin was pooled and reductively aminated with 2-aminopyridine in a Palstation, model 4000 (TAKARA BIO, Inc.), using a Palstation pyridylamination reagent kit for oligosaccharide analysis (TAKARA BIO, Inc.) at 90 °C for 1 h. The PA-derivatized oligosaccharides were purified by extraction with phenol/chloroform/isoamylalchol (25:24:1, v/v/v) and with chloroform followed by gel filtration HPLC on TSKgel G2500PWXL (7.8 mm × 30 cm), which had been equilibrated and was eluted with 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. HPLC was performed with a Shimadzu LC-6A liquid chromatograph equipped with a fluorometer (model RF-10AXL) (Shimadzu Corp. (Kyoto)). The PA-tagged oligosaccharides were detected fluorometrically at an excitation wavelength of 320 nm and an emission wavelength of 400 nm. The lyophilized PA-oligosaccharides were dissolved in buffer G and then applied to an MBP-Sepharose 4B column (3 ml of gel). The column was washed with buffer G, and the bound PA-oligosaccharides were eluted with buffer H. The eluated PA-oligosaccharides were desalted by passage through a Bio-Gel P4 column (1 × 30 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer F, and the purified MBP-binding oligosaccharides were designated as MBP ligand oligosaccharides (MLO). The lyophilized PA-tagged MLO were dissolved in H2O and then applied to a TSKgel DEAE-5PW column (7.8 mm × 7.5 cm) that had been equilibrated with eluent A (aqueous NH3, pH 9.0). After sample injection, the column was eluted with a linear gradient of 0–50% of eluent B (0.25 m ammonium acetate, pH 8.0) over 10 min, and then with eluent A/eluent B (50:50, v/v) for 15 min, followed by 100% eluent B for 35 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at room temperature. PA-sugar chain mixture 3, a mixture of a series of oligosaccharides containing zero to four sialic acid residues/chain, was used as reference sugars. 3H-Labeled PA-MLO was analyzed on a tandemly connected dual TSKgel G3000PWXL column (7.8 mm × 30 cm x 2) that had been equilibrated and was eluted with 10 mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. 3H-Labeled PA-MLO was applied to an amide column (4.6 mm × 25 cm; PALPAK type S) that had been equilibrated with eluent A (200 mm acetic acid-trimethylamine buffer, pH 7.3, and acetonitrile (35:65, v/v). Oligosaccharides were eluted with a linear gradient of eluent B (200 mm acetic acid-trimethylamine buffer, pH 7.3, and acetonitrile (50:50, v/v), from 0 to 100%, over 50 min and then 100% of eluent B for 100 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. The oligosaccharide fraction obtained on C18 Sep-Pak cartridge fractionation of the endo-β-galactosidase digest of 3H-labeled PA-MLO was analyzed by lectin affinity HPLC on LA-PHA-E4, LA-PHA-L4, and LA-AAL columns. The eluents used for the LA-PHA-L4 and LA-PHA-E4 columns were as follows: eluent A, 50 mm Tris-H2SO4 buffer, pH 8.0, and eluent B, 50 mm Tris-H2SO4 buffer, pH 8.0, and 0.1 M potassium tetraborate. The LA-PHA-E4 HPLC column was equilibrated with eluent A, and the oligosaccharides were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–100% of eluent B in 25 min and 100% eluent B for 15 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. The LA-PHA-L4 column was equilibrated with eluent A, and after injection of a sample, the oligosaccharides were eluted with 100% eluent A for 5 min, then a linear gradient of 0–100% of eluent B over 15 min, and finally 100% eluent B for 10 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. The fractions were collected at 0.25 ml/tube, and an aliquot of each fraction was used for determination of 3H radioactivity. The LA-AAL column was equilibrated with eluent A, 50 mm Tris-H2SO4 buffer, pH 7.3. After injection of a sample, the column was eluted with 100% of eluent A for 3 min, then 100% of eluent B (50 mm Tris-H2SO4 buffer, pH 7.3, and 5 mm fucose) from 3 to 13 min, and finally 100% of eluent A from 13 to 50 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature. The fractions were collected at 0.15 ml/tube, and an aliquot of each fraction was used for determination of 3H radioactivity. To a lyophilized sample, 20 μl of 48% HF was added, and then the mixture was left at 4 °C for 48 h. At the end of the reaction, HF was removed off with N2 gas. 3H-Labeled PA-MLO (approximately 1 μg of mannose equivalent) was digested with 25 milliunits of endo-β-galactosidase from E. freundii in 20 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.8, containing 20 mm d-(–)-galactono-1,4-lactone at 37 °C for 48 h under a layer of toluene, according to the conditions described by Fukuda et al. (19Fukuda M. Dell A. Oates J.E. Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8260-8273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After heating at 100 °C for 3 min, the digest was lyophilized. The digest was applied to a C18 Sep-Pak cartridge that had been washed sequentially with methanol, acetonitrile, and H2O. The cartridge was eluted with 3 ml each of H2O, 50% acetonitrile in 5% acetic acid, and 100% acetonitrile in 5% acetic acid in that order, each eluate being pooled and lyophilized. The acidic fraction of 3H-labeled PA-MLO (approximately 2–3 μg of mannose equivalent) was digested with 50 milliunits of neuraminidase (EC 3.2.1.18) from A. ureafaciens in 50 μl of 60 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, at 37 °C for 18 h. After heating at 100 °C for 3 min, the sample was lyophilized. PA-tagged oligosaccharides were subjected to gas phase hydrolysis in 4 n HCl and 4 n trifluoroacetic acid (50:50, v/v) using a glass-made flask under a N2 atmosphere at 100 °C for 4 h, according to information from TAKARA BIO, Inc. (20.bio.takara.co.jp/catalog/protocol.asp?ID=338 (in Japanese)Google Scholar), and an aliquot of the hydrolysate was used for the estimation of PA-tagged reducing terminal sugars. The rest of the hydrolysate was lyophilized and reductively aminated with 2-aminopyridine in a Palstation under the same conditions as described above except that samples were heated at 90 °C for 20 min with a Palstation pyridylamination reagent kit for monosaccharide analysis. Analysis of PA-monosaccharides was carried out on a TSKgel sugar AXI column (4.6 mm × 15 cm) essentially according to the method described by Suzuki et al. (21Suzuki J. Kondo A. Kato I. Hase S. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 55: 283-284Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The column was equilibrated and eluted with 0.7 m borate/KOH buffer, pH 9.0, and acetonitrile (9:1, v/v) at 65 °C at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. PA-sugar"

Mammals have two Lgl homologs, Lgl1 (Mlgl, Hugl) and Lgl2. Lgl1 and Lgl2 directly interact with the Par-6·aPKC protein complex (7Betschinger J. Mechtler K. Knoblich J.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 10Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr.

Loss of Lgl1 in mice results in formation of neuroepithelial rosette-like structures, similar to the neuroblastic rosettes in human primitive neuroectodermal tumors. The newborn Lgl1 knock-out mice develop severe hydrocephalus and die neonatally. Due to loss of mitotic spindle orientation, a large proportion of neural progenitor cells fail to exit the cell cycle and differentiate, and instead, continue to proliferate (11Klezovitch O. Fernandez T.E. Tapscott S.J. Vasioukhin V. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These results have revealed a critical role for mammalian Lgl1 in the regulation of mitotic spindle orientation, proliferation, differentiation, and tissue organization of neuroepithelial cells. Although there is growing information on the protein partners of Lgl, the molecular details of the roles of Lgl in mitotic spindle orientation and cell cycle, however, remain obscure. In Drosophila neuroblasts, the rotation of the spindle requires the activities of Par-3, Inscuteable (Insc), and Partner of inscuteable (Pins) (12Yu F. Morin X. Cai Y. Yang X. Chia W. Cell. 2000; 100: 399-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Although no mammalian gene similar to Insc is known, mammalian Par-3 participates in the establishment of epithelial cell polarity and several mammalian proteins related to Pins have been identified (13Mochizuki N. Cho G. Wen B. Insel P.A. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 181: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J.

The mammalian Pins homolog, LGN, binds the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein NuMA and plays a key role in spindle pole organization during mitosis in mammalian cells (15Du Q. Stukenberg P.T.

Biol. 2002; 12: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). NuMA is a large coiled-coil and microtubule (MT)-binding protein that organizes the spindle poles orientation (17Gaglio T. Saredi A. Compton D.A. J.

The binding of NuMA to LGN is necessary for the binding of LGN to the α subunits of heterotrimeric G-protein (Gα) at the cell cortex (19Du Q. Macara I.G. Cell. 2004; 119: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The ternary NuMA·LGN·Gα complex regulates the interaction of aster MTs with the cell cortex, thereby causing the chromosome segregation during mitosis (19Du Q. Macara I.G.

Lgl2 formed a complex with aPKC, Par-6, and LGN favorably in mitotic cells. The inhibition of the binding between Lgl2 and LGN caused the mitotic spindle disorganization and the chromosome mis-segregation through affecting the formation of the LGN·NuMA complex. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—One bait vector, pGBD Lgl2 (full-length, aa 1–1015), was constructed by subcloning the insert encoding the amino acid residue of Lgl2 into pGBD-C1 (20James P. Hallady J. Gottschling E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid screening libraries constructed from human brain cDNAs were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Two-hybrid screening using the yeast strain PJ69-4A (MATα trp1–901 leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 his3–200 gal4Δ gal80Δ GAL2-ADE2 LYS2::GAL1-HIS3 met2::GAL7-lacZ) was performed as described (20James P. Hallady J. Gottschling E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard procedures for yeast manipulations were performed as described (21Kaiser C.A. Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Vectors—The cDNA encoding full-length human Lgl2 was obtained as described previously (10Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding full-length human LGN (IMAGE: 712445) was obtained from ATCC (Rockville, MD). Expression vectors were constructed in pCMV-HA (22Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), pMAL-C2 (New England Biolabs Inc.), and pFastBac1-maltose-binding protein (MBP) using standard molecular biology methods. The pFastBac1-MBP was constructed with a baculovirus transfer vector, pFastBac1 (Invitrogen), to express a fusion protein with N-terminal MBP. Constructs of human Lgl2 and LGN contained the following aa: pCMV-HA-Lgl2-Full, aa 1–1015; pCMV-HA-Lgl2-N, aa 1–640; pCMV-HA-Lgl2-C, aa 636–1015; and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-LGN-Full, aa 1–677; GST-LGN-N, aa 1–365; GST-LGN-C, aa 360–677. Knockdown of Lgl and LGN by the RNA Interference Method—The mammalian expression vector, pBS-H1 (23Yamada A. Irie K. Hirota T. Ooshio T. Fukuhara A. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6016-6027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), was used for expression of small interfering RNA in HEK293 cells. The following inserts were used: human LGN gene-specific insert was a 19-nucleotide (nt) sequence corresponding to nts 124–142 (GCTGCAGTTCAAGTTGGAA) of human LGN cDNA; human Lgl1 gene-specific insert was a 19-nt sequence corresponding to nts 2160–2178 (CCTATACTTTGCCGACACA) of human Lgl1 cDNA; human Lgl2 gene-specific insert was a 19-nt sequence corresponding to nts 605–623 (ACCAGATCCTGATCGGCTA) of human Lgl2 cDNA; and a control (Scramble) insert was a 19-nt sequence (TCTAACAGTGTCCGAGCCA) with no significant homology to any mammalian gene sequence, all of which were separated by a 9-nt noncomplementary spacer (TTCAAGAGA) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nt sequence. Antibodies—The GST fusion fragment of LGN (aa 360–677) was produced in Escherichia coli, purified, and used as antigen to raise a polyclonal antibody (pAb) in rabbit. The rabbit anti-LGN pAb was affinity-purified using MBP-LGN-C (aa 360–677) immobilized on Amino-link agarose beads (Pierce). A mouse anti-HA monoclonal Ab (mAb) was purchased from Babco. A rat anti-HA mAb was purchased from Roche Applied Science. A mouse anti-aPKCλ mAb was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. A goat anti-Par-6 pAb was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechonology. A mouse anti-NuMA mAb was purchased from Calbiochem. A mouse anti-α-tubulin mAb was purchased from Sigma. A mouse anti-actin mAb was purchased from Chemicon. Rabbit anti-Lgl1 and Lgl2 pAbs were made as described previously (10Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Pull-down Assay—To determine the binding site of Lgl2 to LGN, HEK293 cells were transfected with pCMV-HA-Lgl2-Full, -N, and -C. After 48-h incubation, the cells were harvested and suspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 15 min. The extract was applied onto the full-length or truncated form of GST-LGN (500 pmol) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) (100 μl wet volume). After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer A, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl at pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) for 10 min. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-HA mAb. Direct Binding of Lgl2 to LGN—MBP-Lgl2-C or MBP-Lgl2-Full was incubated with GST-LGN-Full or GST alone (20 pmol each) immobilized on 40 μl (wet volume) of glutathione-Sepharose beads in 400 μl of Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 27.5 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100) at 25 °C for 2 h. After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The amount of bound MBP-Lgl2 was determined by comparing the intensity of its band with those of various amounts of bovine serum albumin using a densitometer Fluorchem™ (Alpha Innotech Corp.). The Kd value was calculated by Scatchard analysis. Cell Culture, Cell Cycle Synchronization, and Transfection— HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum. To synchronize the cells in mitosis, thymidine and nocodazole treatment was performed as described (24Zieve G.W. Turnbull D. Mullins J.M. Mcintosh J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1980; 126: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5 mm thymidine (Sigma) for 16 h and incubated in fresh DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 8 h. After the incubation, nocodazole (Sigma) was added at a final concentration of 0.33 μm, and the incubation was continued for another 4 h. HEK293 cells were transfected with the full-length or truncated form of pCMV-HA-Lgl2 using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 48-h incubation, the cells were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells per dish onto 35-mm collagen type I-coated dish. At 24 h after the seeding, the cells were fixed and stained with DAPI (Nacalai Tesque) and the rat anti-HA mAb. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—HEK293 cells treated with or without the thymidine and nocodazole treatment were extracted by the addition of Buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0, 27.5 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10% sucrose, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm EDTA, 10 μm α-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The cell extract was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The extract was incubated with the anti-LGN pAb (5 μg) or the anti-Lgl2 pAb (5 μg) at 4 °C for 18 h. Immunocomplexes were then precipitated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). After the beads were extensively washed with Buffer C, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with the anti-Lgl2, anti-aPKCλ, anti-Par-6, or anti-LGN Abs. Other Methods—Immunofluorescence microscopy of cultured cells was done as described (25Kamei T. Matozaki T. Sakisaka T. Kodama A. Yokoyama S. Peng Y.F. Nakano K. Takaishi K. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6776-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was done as described by Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). To identify a Lgl2-binding protein(s), we performed the yeast two-hybrid screening using a human brain library with full-length Lgl2 as a bait. We isolated full-length of LGN (Fig. 1A). LGN has a modular domain structure consisting of seven tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR) and four G-protein regulatory (GPR) or GoLoco domains. The TPR domain may serve as a regulatory domain for the interaction between the GPR domain and Gα (28Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or may play an important role in the localization of LGN (28Pizzinat N. Takesono A. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16601-16610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The GPR domain interacts with Gα and stabilizes the GDP-bound form of Gα (29Kaushik R. Yu F. Chia W. Yang X. Bahri S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3144-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We next confirmed the binding of Lgl2 to LGN and determined their binding regions by a pull-down assay. HA-tagged full-length Lgl2 expressed in HEK293 cells bound the N-terminal fragment of LGN (LGN-N, aa 1–365) but not the C-terminal fragment (LGN-C, aa 360–677) (Fig. 1B). HA-tagged C-terminal fragment of Lgl2 (Lgl2-C, aa 636–1015), but not N-terminal fragment of Lgl2 (Lgl2-N, aa 1–640), bound the N-terminal fragment of LGN (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that the C-terminal region of Lgl2 binds the N-terminal region of LGN. To confirm the direct binding of Lgl2 to LGN, we performed affinity chromatography using the pure recombinant proteins of Lgl2 and LGN. MBP-Lgl2-C bound to immobilized GST-LGN-full-length but not GST (Fig. 2A). MBP-Lgl2-full-length bound to GST-LGN-full-length but less efficiently than MBP-Lgl2-C. There might be a conformational change required for efficient binding between Lgl2-full-length and LGN-full-length. As Lgl2 has been shown to bind to Par-6 through its N-terminal WD repeats and aPKC through its phosphorylation sites (10Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), these bindings might help to open the C-terminal tail of Lgl2 for its binding to LGN. The binding of MBP-Lgl2-C to GST-LGN-full-length was dose-dependent and saturable (Fig. 2B). Scatchard analysis demonstrated a single class of binding site with a Kd value of 56 nm. These results indicate that Lgl2 directly binds LGN. To examine the in vivo binding of Lgl2 to LGN, a co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed using the HEK293 cell lysate. When Lgl2 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-Lgl2 pAb, LGN was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 3A). Lgl2 was reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-LGN pAb. In addition to LGN, Par-6 and aPKC were co-immunoprecipitated with Lgl2, consistent with the earlier observations that Lgl2 forms a complex with Par-6 and aPKC (7Betschinger J. Mechtler K. Knoblich J.A. Nature. 2003; 422: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 10Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thus, Lgl2 forms a novel complex with Par-6, aPKC, and LGN. LGN has been shown to play an important role in spindle pole orientation and to localize at cell periphery during mitosis (29Kaushik R. Yu F. Chia W. Yang X. Bahri S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3144-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined by a co-immunoprecipitation assay whether the amount of the Lgl2·Par-6·aPKC·LGN complex is changed during mitosis. To produce large numbers of mitotic cells, HEK293 cells were treated with thymidine and nocodazole. Over 80% of the cells showed mitotic cell phenotype (data not shown). The Lgl2·Par-6·aPKC·LGN complex was more predominantly formed in the mitotic cells than in the control cells (Fig. 3A). We furthermore examined by immunostaining the localization of these proteins in the interphase and the metaphase of HEK293 cells. As shown previously (29Kaushik R. Yu F. Chia W. Yang X. Bahri S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3144-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), LGN localized in the cytoplasm in the interphase and at the cell periphery in the metaphase (Fig. 3B). aPKC co-localized with LGN at the cell periphery in the metaphase. Lgl2 and aPKC co-localized in the perinuclear structure and faintly at the cell-cell contact sites in the interphase. In the metaphase, Lgl2 and aPKC as well as LGN localized at the cell periphery. These immunostaining data are consistent with the biochemical data shown in Fig. 2A and suggest that Lgl2 forms a complex with LGN, aPKC, and Par-6 during mitosis. Dysfunction of LGN has been shown to have the phenotype of multiple micronuclei due to chromosomal mis-segregation and defect in cell division through mis-localization of mitotic spindle regulator NuMA, a LGN binding partner (15Du Q. Stukenberg P.T. Macara I.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 16Du Q. Taylor L. Compton D.A. Macara I.G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate the functional significance of the binding between Lgl2 and LGN, we examined the effect of overexpression of Lgl2-C, the LGN-binding fragment, on cell division. About 8% of the cells overexpressing Lgl2-C showed the presence of multiple micronuclei (Fig. 4A). Less than 0.5% of the cells overexpressing HA-control, Lgl2-full-length, and Lgl2-N contained micronuclei. We next examined whether the Lgl-C-induced formation of multiple micronuclei is due to chromosomal mis-segregation and defect in mitotic spindle organization through dysfunction of NuMA. Both NuMA and MTs of mitotic spindle were mis-localized in the cells overexpressing Lgl-C. LGN, but not aPKC and Par-6, was not localized at the cell cortex during mitosis in the cells overexpressing Lgl-C (Fig. 4B and data not shown). To further confirm this result, we performed a loss-of-function analysis by use of the RNA interference (RNAi) method. We knocked down endogenous Lgl (Lgl1 and Lgl2) and LGN by the RNAi method (Fig. 4C). The Lgl-knockdown cells had apparently a similar multinucleate phenotype as that of the LGN-knockdown cells (Fig. 4A). The percentage of the Lgl-knockdown cells showing the multinucleate phenotype was 6% and slightly less than that of the LGN-knockdown cells. Both NuMA and MTs of mitotic spindle were mis-localized in the Lgl-knockdown cells similarly to those of the LGN-knockdown cells. In addition, LGN, but not aPKC and Par-6, was not localized at the cell cortex during mitosis in the Lgl-knockdown cells. These results suggest that Lgl plays a role in chromosome segregation through regulating the LGN and NuMA localization during mitosis. In addition, to examine the Lgl-C effect on binding between endogenous LGN and NuMA in the cells, we examined the amount of NuMA bound to endogenous LGN by a co-immunoprecipitation assay using the anti-LGN pAb. The LGN·NuMA complex was more predominantly formed in the cells overexpressing Lgl-C than in the control cells (Fig. 4D). Lgl2-C indeed bound to LGN more predominantly than Lgl2-full-length. These results indicate that the binding of Lgl2 to LGN is important for the formation of the LGN·NuMA complex to regulate chromosome segregation. Previous studies have shown that Lgl2 is largely expressed at the cell-cell contact sites in epithelial cells (10Yamanaka T. Horikoshi Y. Sugiyama Y. Ishiyama C. Suzuki A. Hirose T. Iwamatsu A. Shinohara A. Ohno S. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 734-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, there have been no analysis of potential change in the pattern of Lgl2 complex formation during mitosis. We have first presented here that Lgl2 forms a novel complex with LGN, Par-6, and aPKC and that this complex formation is enhanced during mitosis. This complex shows cortical localization in mitotic cells. The functional significance of the cell cycle-dependent cortical localizaiton of this complex is not yet clear, but the localization of LGN at the cell cortex during mitosis is somewhat similar to what is described for Drosophila Pins. In Drosophila, Pins is normally found in the lateral cortex of epithelial cells and only become asymmetrically localizes upon the expression of inscuteable in neuroblasts, for which a mammalian homolog has not been found so far (31Kraut R. Chia W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Knoblich J.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Pins is also dependent on heterotrimeric G-protein activity for its localization (30Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pins and LGN have been shown to bind Gα through their C-terminal GPR domain (29Kaushik R. Yu F. Chia W. Yang X. Bahri S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3144-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Schaefer M. Petronczki M. Dorner D. Forte M. Knoblich J.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 183-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). They behave as GDP dissociation inhibitors of the Gα. For the efficient binding of LGN to Gα at the cell cortex, the binding of LGN to NuMA seems to be prerequisite (19Du Q. Macara I.G. Cell. 2004; 119: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). LGN normally folds back onto itself and shows a closed conformation. The binding to NuMA triggers a partially open state of LGN for further interaction with Gα. The formation of ternary NuMA·LGN·Gα complex regulates the interaction of aster MTs with the cell cortex, thereby causing the chromosome segregation during mitosis. The binding of Lgl2 to LGN enhances the formation of NuMA-LGN complex. Lgl2 seems to induce the full activation of LGN in cooperation with NuMA at the cell cortex during mitosis. Formation of the Lgl2·Par-6·aPKC·LGN complex might activate the activity of LGN during mitosis. Therefore, the Lgl2·Par-6·aPKC·LGN complex may play a role in coupling the Par signaling pathway to LGN and the heterotrimeric G-proteins, to ensure that bipolar spindles are correctly organized and oriented for normal cell division."

The best studied group of autoinducers are the acylhomoserine lactones (AHSLs), which are central to the regulation of virulence in many plant and animal pathogens. Variation of the acyl side chain of the AHSLs underlies the observed species specificity of this communication system. Here we show that even different strains of the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora employ different dialects of this language and demonstrate the molecular basis for the acyl chain length specificity of distinct AHSL synthases. Under physiological concentrations, only the cognate AHSL with the “right” acyl chain is recognized as a signal that will switch on virulence genes. Mutagenesis of the AHSL synthase gene expISCC1 identified the changes M127T and F69L as sufficient to effectively alter ExpISCC1 (an N-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone producer) substrate specificity to that of an N-3-oxooctanoyl-l-homoserine lactone producer.

After the AHSL concentration reaches a critical threshold level corresponding to a certain quorum of bacteria, the AHSL interacts with the cognate R-protein and controls the expression of quorum sensing-regulated target genes (1Whitehead N.A.

At present, >70 AHSL synthases (LuxI-like I-proteins) and sensors (LuxR-like R-proteins) are known (4Taga M.E. Bassler B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In E. carotovora, the production of both carbapenem antibiotics and extracellular enzyme (cellulase, pectate lyase, polygalacturonase, and protease) virulence factors is controlled by AHSLs and, hence, requires a functional I-protein known as CarI or ExpI, respectively (1Whitehead N.A.

Although carbapenem synthesis in E. carotovora ATT39048 is positively regulated by an R-protein (CarR) (1Whitehead N.A. Barnard A.M. Slater H. Simpson N.J.L. Salmond G.P.C. FEMS Microbiol.

For the actual change in target protein levels, several other factors might be important, including small regulatory RNA chaperones influencing RNA stability (e.g. Hfq of Vibrio harveyi and RsmA in E. carotovora (17Lenz D.H.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24291-24296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The enzymatic reaction mechanism of AHSL synthesis involves the substrates S-adenosyl-l-methionine and an acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) (20More M.I.

The crystal structure of EsaI, the I-protein of P. stewartii, revealed a high similarity of the AHSL synthase to N-acetyltransferases and allowed modeling of the 3-oxo-C6-phosphopantetheine part of acyl-ACP in the active cavity of EsaI. Mutation analysis was used to demonstrate the importance of several residues for the activity of EsaI, thereby confirming the model (23Watson W.T. Minogue T.D. Val D.L. Beck von Bodman S. Churchill M.E.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Additional conserved residues essential for activity have been identified in LuxI (24Hanzelka B.L. Stevens A.M. Parsek M.R. Crone T.J. Greenberg E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4882-4887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and RhlI (25Parsek M.R. Schaefer A.L. Greenberg E.P. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In EsaI, the substrate acyl-ACP selection seems to be due to binding to a hydrophobic pocket. Indeed, changing of the conserved Thr-140 to Ala resulted in the production of fully reduced homoserine lactones instead of N-3-oxohexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), which has been explained as a stabilizing effect of a favorable hydrogen bond between the C3 carbonyl and the hydroxy group of Thr (23Watson W.T. Minogue T.D. Val D.L. Beck von Bodman S. Churchill M.E.A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The recently described crystal structure of LasI from P. aeruginosa seems to indicate that different bacteria might have different mechanisms for substrate selection. Here, a tunnel with no apparent restriction on acyl chain length passing through the enzyme can accommodate the acyl chain of the acyl-ACP substrate (26Gould T.A. Schweizer H.P. Churchill M.E.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).It has been speculated (2Fuqua C. Greenberg E.P. Nat. Rev. Mol.

Cell. 2002; 9: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) that the C terminus of I-proteins should contain residues responsible for specificity to a substrate with a certain acyl side chain length, but the actual residues and structural prerequisites determining this specificity have not yet been identified. Here, we describe the specificity of AHSL signaling in E. carotovora and demonstrate the molecular basis for the substrate chain length specificity of the AHSL synthase ExpI. The changes M127T and F69L in ExpI resulted in a product shift from 3-oxo-C6-HSL to N-3-oxooctanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C8-HSL). Additional multiple amino acid changes restored production of the changed product 3-oxo-C8-HSL to wild type levels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Mutagenesis—The E. carotovora strains SCC1 and SCC3193 originate from potato field collections near the Viikki Campus of the University of Helsinki (27Pirhonen M. Palva E.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 170-172Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The expISCC1 gene was amplified from E. carotovora SCC1 DNA by PCR with 5′-CGGGATCCATGTTAGAGATATTTG-3′ (5′-CGGGATCCTTAGAGATATTTGATGTAAATC-3′ without ATG for cloning into pQE30 (Qiagen)) and 5′-GGAAGCTTTCAAGCCTGTGCAATAG-3′ cloned into BamHI/HindIII sites of pBluescript II SK or pQE30 and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α and JM109. ExpISCC1 (GenBank™ accession number AY507108) is >99% identical to CarI and 70% identical to ExpISCC3193. Mutations were created using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit with plasmids containing expISCC3193 (13Pirhonen M. Flego D. Heikinheimo R. Palva E.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2467-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) or expISCC1. Each mutation was confirmed by sequencing, and plasmids were transformed by electroporation to an AHSL synthase-deficient (ExpI-) transposon mutant of E. carotovora without detectable AHSL production (SCC3065), which is derived from strain SCC3193 (13Pirhonen M.

Cellulase assays were performed with 10-μl supernatants of overnight grown cultures on cellulose indicator plates (carboxymethylcellulose) using Congo Red to determine cellulose digestion as described (13Pirhonen M.

After evaporating to dryness in a SpeedVac, samples were dissolved in 20 μl (potato) or 200 μl (LB and M9) of 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid. 5 μl of the dissolved samples were injected for liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis by an Agilent 1100 series high performance liquid chromatography system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Luna (Phenomenex) C18 column (100 × 4.6-mm inner diameter, 3-μm particle size) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml min-1 with 45 or 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid coupled without split to a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Q-TOF Micro, Micromass Instruments). The positive electrospray ionization conditions included a capillary voltage of 3.2 kV, a cone voltage of 20 V, 5 eV ionization, a source temperature of 110 °C, and a desolvation temperature of 400 °C. Tandem mass spectrometry spectra were generated with a collision energy of 12 eV with argon. AHSL standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (C7-, C8-, 3-oxo-C6-HSL) or synthesized (C4-, C6-, C9-, 3-oxo-C8-HSL) as described (10Zhang L. Murphy P.J. Kerr A. Tate M.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). 3-OH-C6- and 3-OH-C8-HSL have been reduced from the corresponding 3-oxo-derivatives by stirring at room temperature with equimolar amounts of sodium borohydride in methanol for 15 min followed by purification over silica gel with chloroform/methanol. 3-Oxo-C5-, 3-oxo-C7-, 3-oxo-C9, 3-oxo-C10-, C5-, and C10-HSL have been identified by their high performance liquid chromatography retention time as well as by tandem mass spectrometry analysis.Immunoblot Analysis—For Western blot hybridization, E. coli JM109 was grown overnight in triplicate, diluted into fresh LB medium, and grown until the A600 was 0.7. Expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and, after 4 h, 1 ml of culture was collected. After an additional 2 h of growth, 2-ml supernatants of the same cultures were collected for AHSL measurement as described above. The pellet collected at 4 h was suspended in 100 μl of 6× PAGE sample buffer, and 10 μl were loaded to the gel. Protein extracts were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred with a buffer tank blotting system (Hoefer, Amersham Biosciences) to nitrocellulose membrane (Nitro Bind, Micron Separations Inc.) using standard protocols (29Elbing K.

As the primary antibody, an anti-His5 monoclonal antibody (Qiagen) was used at a 1:2000 dilution according to manufacturer's instructions.

Palva E.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2467-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 28Pirhonen M. Saarilahti H. Karlsson M.-B. Palva E.T. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1991; 4: 276-283Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar) of E. carotovora wild type strain SCC3193 exhibits strongly reduced virulence and extracellular enzyme production, which can be rescued by exogenous addition of this autoinducer (13Pirhonen M. Flego D. Heikinheimo R. Palva E.T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2467-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). However, the substrate specificity of the AHSL synthases and the AHSL recognition specificity of the R-proteins is not absolute but may also include structurally similar AHSLs (15Welch M. Todd D.E. Whitehead N.A. McGowan S.J. Bycroft B.W. Salmond G.P.C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 22Parsek M.R. Val D.L. Hanzelka B.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4360-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). To assess the specificity of the autoinducer communication system in SCC3193, we compared the ability of AHSLs with different chain lengths and with or without a 3-oxo-group at the C3 position of the acyl chain to restore cellulase (Cel) production in SCC3065. To our surprise, <0.05 μm 3-oxo-C8-HSL is required to restore Cel production; this is >200 times less than the concentration of 3-oxo-C6-HSL needed to achieve the same effect (Fig. 1). The AHSLs with fully reduced acyl chains have intermediate activity with N-octanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL) as the most active compound (Fig. 1B). Obviously, the recognition of AHSLs in SCC3065 (and SCC3193) seems to be optimized for 3-oxo-C8-HSL rather than for 3-oxo-C6-HSL.This finding prompted us to characterize the AHSL profile of SCC3193 with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (Fig. 2A and Table I). Indeed, the main AHSL in SCC3193 is 3-oxo-C8-HSL, and only traces of 3-oxo-C6-HSL can be detected. An inverse AHSL profile can be observed in another E. carotovora strain (SCC1) (27Pirhonen M. Palva E.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 170-172Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with 3-oxo-C6-HSL as the main component. The type of AHSL produced is dependent on the corresponding I-protein (22Parsek M.R. Val D.L. Hanzelka B.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Greenberg E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4360-4365Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 23Watson W.T. Minogue T.D. Val D.L. Beck von Bodman S. Churchill M.E.A. Mol.

The expI mutant SCC3065, which itself produces no detectable amounts of AHSLs, produces either 3-oxo-C6- or 3-oxo-C8-HSL after the introduction of expISCC1 or expISCC3193, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B). A mixed culture of SCC3065 + expISCC1 and SCC3065 + expISCC3193 results in the concomitant production of both 3-oxo-C6- and 3-oxo-C8-HSL. E. coli JM109 containing expISCC1 or expISCC3193 produces similar profiles with 3-oxo-C6- or 3-oxo-C8-HSL as the main components (data not shown).Fig. 2Strain- and ExpI-specific AHSL production in E. carotovora.

It seems that in the more stringent in planta environment only a few AHSLs have a role in determining virulence, as indicated by the poorer AHSL profile produced by E. carotovora in planta (Supplemental Table I). The specificity of SCC3193 for 3-oxo-C8-HSL in planta is also demonstrated by the inability of the 3-oxo-C6-HSL-producing ExpISCC1 to complement the avirulent phenotype of SCC3065 in potato (Fig. 2C). This lack of complementation is not due to the inability of ExpISCC1 to direct the synthesis of 3-oxo-C6-HSL in SCC3065 in planta as revealed by mixed infection with SCC3065 + expISCC1 and SCC3065 + expISCC3193 (Fig. 2B). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the two different strains of E. carotovora use different dialects of the same AHSL language in their control of virulence and that these dialects are strain-specific at the physiological concentrations of the respective AHSLs.Mutation Analysis Reveals Critical Residues for the Substrate Chain Length Specificity of the AHSL Synthase—The molecular basis for the distinct acyl chain length specificity of different autoinducer synthases, essential for the specificity of bacterial communication, has not been elucidated. The alignment of closely related ExpI-proteins with different chain length specificities augmented by the crystal structure of EsaI allows us now to identify candidates for the critical residues determining acyl chain length specificity.

These residues in ExpISCC1 are Leu-67 (Val in EsaI and ExpIEch), Phe-69, Leu-123, and Met-127; the corresponding residues in ExpISCC3193 are Ser-67, Leu-69, Phe-123, and Thr-127 (numbering according to ExpISCC1). The identity of residue 126 does not correlate with C6 or C8 production, as it is Ser-126 in CarI and ExpISCC1 but Ala-126 in all other sequences.

Ionotropic glutamate receptors are the main excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian central nervous system and hence play a key role in processes such as learning and memory (1Mayer M.L.

The validity of these inferences hinges on the assumption that the isolated ligand-binding domain is a good model for the domain in a functional receptor, i.e. the ligand-binding domain in the presence of the functional unit, namely the transmembrane segments forming the ion channel. The assumption that the S1S2 protein is a representative model of the domain in the full glutamate receptor is currently based on equilibrium ligand binding assays that suggest similar ligand binding properties for the two proteins (16Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 17Chen G.-Q. Sun Y. Jin R. Gouaux E. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2623-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and recent UV-visible spectroscopic investigations that indicate a similar electronic environment for the antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitro-2,3-dihydroxy-quinoxaline in the S1S2 protein as in the full-length receptors expressed in cells (18Deming D. Cheng Q. Jayaraman V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17589-17592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this report we have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to provide the first direct confirmation that the ligand-binding domain of a functional glutamate receptor exhibits the same conformational changes (cleft closure) due to agonist binding as that observed in the structures of the S1S2 protein. For these FRET investigations we have modified the cysteine light ΔN-GluR4 homomeric receptors. The ΔN-GluR4 receptors have the extracellular N-terminal domain (residues 1–402) deleted from the GluR4 flip subunit of the α-amino-5-methyl-3-hydroxy-4-isoxazole propionate subtype of the glutamate receptor and represent the minimum model construct essential for the full function, namely agonist-induced activation and desensitization, of the receptor. The two extracellular non-disulfide-bonded cysteine residues (426 and 529) in this ΔN-GluR4 construct were mutated to serine, providing a receptor with no accessible cysteines. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was then introduced at the N terminus to this modified protein to serve as the acceptor, and cysteines were introduced at specific positions and tagged using a maleimide derivative of terbium chelate to serve as the donor molecule and distances between donor and acceptor measured based on the FRET efficiency. Mutations and eGFP-tagged Cysteine Light GluR4 Construct Preparation—Using the construct for the GluR4-flip receptor with the first 402 residues deleted (generously provided by Dr. Keinanen, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland) the two accessible non-disulfide-bonded cysteine residues, Cys426 present in the extracellular side as well as Cys529 present in the first transmembrane segment of the receptor, were mutated to serine using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For introducing the GFP at the N terminus of this double mutant, the ΔN-GluR4-C426S-C529S construct was amplified with PCR using primers containing XhoI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites; the PCR product was digested by using the XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes and subcloned into the corresponding sites of pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Invitrogen). This construct was digested with NheI and BamHI, and the 2.3-kb fragment, which contained the ΔN-GluR4-C426S-C529S construct cDNA fused with coding sequence for eGFP at the N terminus, was cloned into pcDNA3.1. The construct thus obtained (ΔN*-GFP) served as the background construct on which residues 444, 446, 653, and 686 were then individually mutated to cysteine to yield the four constructs used for the FRET study. For the donor only experiments the same mutations were performed on the ΔN-GluR4-C426S-C529S without the presence of GPF tag (ΔN*). Mutations in the plasmids were introduced using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA), and the integrity of the final constructs verified by sequencing the coding region for both strands of the DNA. Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK-293) Cell Cultures—HEK-293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin in 250-cc culture flasks. Transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) transfection reagent with 0.5 μg of modified glutamate receptor cDNAs per ml of medium. Transfected cells were allowed to grow for 1–3 days before use. Receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells were washed in extracellular buffer and labeled at specific cysteine sites with the maleimide derivative of terbium chelate for an hour. The cells were then washed with extracellular buffer until no free dye was observed in the wash and were subsequently used for fluorescence lifetime measurements. For electrophysiological characterization, the HEK-293 cells expressing the mutant receptors were labeled with the probe for half an hour then rinsed once with extracellular buffer prior to the measurements. Electrophysiological Measurements—For whole cell current recordings, transfected HEK-293 cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of –60 mV, and solutions were applied using a home mode U tube with a 100-μm aperture. The electrode solution, for the electrophysiological measurements, contained 140 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4); the extracellular bath solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Currents were amplified with an Axon 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), low pass filtered at 1 kHz. The filtered signal was digitized using a Labmaster DMA digitizing board controlled by Axon PClamp software. All the experiments were performed at room temperature and at pH 7.4. Fluorescence Measurements—The fluorescence measurements were obtained using a TimeMaster™ model TM-3/2003 (Photon Technologies Inc.), a cuvette-based fluorescence lifetime spectrometer. A nitrogen/dye laser system provided high intensity illumination that was fiber-optically coupled to the sample compartment, which contains a thermostatable cuvette holder with microstirrer. Emitted light was collected by quartz optics at 90 degrees to the incident beam and passed through a 200-mm monochromator to a stroboscopic detector. Data were collected using Felix 3.0 software and analyzed using Kaleidagraph (Synergy software). Determination of the R0 Value for GFP and Terbium Tagged to the Glutamate Receptor—The overlap integral J was calculated using Equation 1,J=∑iFD(λi)⋅εA(λi)⋅λi4∑iFD(λi)(Eq. 1) where FD(λ) is the fluorescence spectrum of terbium, ϵA(λ) the absorption spectrum of GFP tagged to the glutamate receptor, and λ is the wavelength. The calculations were performed using a spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel), and the value of J was determined to be 2.82⋅1015 M−1 cm−1 nm4. Using this value for J, R0 was then calculated using Equation 2,R06=8.785⋅10−5⋅κ2⋅ϕD⋅Jn4(Eq. 2) where κ is the orientation factor, ϕ is the quantum yield of terbium, and n is the refractive index. Using 2/3 as the value for κ (19Haas E. Katchalski-Katzir E. Steinberg I.Z. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5064-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), 0.6 for ϕ (Clontech), and 1.3 as the value for n, R0 was determined to be 59 Å. Since the absorption spectrum of terbium was not significantly altered for the different sites probed, this R0 value was used for determining the distances for all the sites probed. Distance Calculations Based on Lifetime—The distance between the donor:acceptor fluorophores was determined by measuring the time constants of donor fluorescence decay in the absence (τD) and sensitized emission of the acceptor due to energy transfer from the donor (τDA) and using Equation 3 given by Förster's theory of singlet-singlet energy transfer.R=R0(τDAτD−τDA)1/6(Eq. 3) The error in the distances determined by FRET assuming a 2/3 as the value of κ was established by measuring the fluorescence anisotropy, p, of the donor and acceptor. A detailed calculation outlining the conversion of the p values of the donor and acceptor in terms of the error in FRET is provided by Haas et al. (19Haas E. Katchalski-Katzir E. Steinberg I.Z. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5064-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The value of p was determined by measuring the intensity of the light in the parallel (I∥) and perpendicular (I∥) positions.p=I∥−I⊥I∥+I⊥(Eq. 4) Using Equation 4, the value of p was determined to be 0.47 for GFP tagged to glutamate, and this was not significantly altered by the presence of terbium chelate at the different sites on the protein. Since the terbium chelate is unpolarized it does not contribute to the error. Therefore using the value of 0.47 for GPF, the maximum error in the FRET distances was determined to be +12% to –9% of the actual distances using the calculations of Haas et al. (19Haas E. Katchalski-Katzir E. Steinberg I.Z. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5064-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Functional Characterization of the Mutant Proteins—Each of the mutant proteins with the donor and acceptor tags were individually characterized using electrophysiological measurements to ensure that they exhibited similar activation and desensitization as the wild type receptor. Whole cell currents were obtained in the presence of partial agonist kainate (10 mm) and full agonist glutamate (10 mm) under desensitizing conditions (absence of cyclothiazide) and non-desensitizing conditions (presence of cyclothiazide (100 μm)) (Fig. 1A). These studies show that the whole cell currents are similar for the wild type and mutant proteins tagged with fluorophores with 1) the activation of full agonist glutamate leading to significantly larger currents than the activation by partial agonist kainate, 2) the receptors being predominantly desensitized in the continued presence full agonist glutamate with similar lifetimes for desensitization (9–14 ms), and 3) desensitization being blocked in the presence of cyclothiazide. Additionally, the doseresponse curves as determined by the dependence of the peak currents due to activation by various concentrations of glutamate are not significantly different for the wild type and mutant proteins tagged with fluorophores (Fig. 1B) indicating that the equilibrium binding properties are not significantly different. Since the fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments probe the equilibrium end states these mutants are excellent models for this study. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—The distances between the reference GFP protein tagged at the N terminus and various residues in the S1 and S2 segments tagged with the terbium chelate donor were determined in the apo and various ligated states by using the lifetimes of acceptor-sensitized emission and donor emission without an acceptor (Table I; Fig. 2 and supplemental material). When sites 444 and 446 are tagged with the terbium chelate fluorophore, no changes are observed in the sensitized emission lifetime between apo, kainate bound, glutamate bound, and glutamate bound in the presence of cyclothiazide (Table I; Fig. 2 and supplemental material). This indicates that the distance between the donor and acceptor is the same in all these states of the protein. Since residues 444 and 446 are present in domain 1 of the glutamate receptor (Fig. 2), it can be concluded that the position of the acceptor GFP with respect to domain 1 is the same for the protein in the apo, kainate bound, glutamate bound, and glutamate bound in the presence of cyclothiazide.Table ILifetimes for the donor only (τD in μs), sensitized emission lifetimes (τDA in μs), and the distances (rDA in Å) computed based on the lifetimes for the various sites probedSiteApoKainate boundGlutamate boundGlutamate bound in presence of CZLifetimerDALifetimerDALifetimerDALifetimerDAτDτDAτDτDAτDτDAτDτDAS653C104947.436110127.932108912.428108013.628T686C105942.135110128.833111023.431107422.131A444C94013.02993514.12993113.82994712.829V446C93913.92994013.82993512.92995113.229 Open table in a new tab The lifetime for the sensitized emission when the donor is attached to residues 653 or 686, on the other hand, is state-dependent and follows the order apo state > kainate bound > glutamate bound ∼ glutamate bound in the presence of cyclothiazide (Fig. 2). This order indicates that distance between acceptor GFP and donor tagged at these sites decreases upon going from the apo state to the agonists bound states and also that full agonist glutamate induces a larger decrease in the distance relative to partial agonist kainate. Furthermore, the absence of an affect on the lifetime due to cyclothiazide suggests that the distance between the donor and acceptor is not altered significantly by the presence of cylclothiazide. Residues 653 and 686 are present on domain 2 of the ligand-binding segment (Fig. 2); therefore the movement of these residues toward GFP upon binding agonists with larger decrease in distance upon binding glutamate relative to kainate is in complete agreement with the x-ray structures of the isolated ligand-binding domain which indicate partial cleft closure upon binding kainate and full cleft closure upon binding glutamate. These results provide conclusive proof that the structural changes in the isolated ligand-binding domain are replicated in a fully functional glutamate receptor. In addition, the present results also provide the first evidence that there is no significant change in the degree of cleft closure between the open and desensitized states of the protein (glutamate bound in the presence of cyclothiazide and glutamate bound states). The lack of significant changes within a domain upon going from the activated to desensitized state is consistent with the current hypothesis based on structural and functional investigations, where it has been suggested that cleft closure predominantly mediates channel opening (activation), while desensitization is predominantly mediated by the decoupling of the interface between the S1S2 dimers (7Armstrong N.A.

https://openalex.org/W1987024939,"The presence of a complete (BH1-3) proapoptotic molecule is necessary for the induction of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade in mammalian cells. It is unclear, however, what distinct roles the members of the large family of BH3-only proapoptotic molecules play in apoptosis. Although biochemical analysis of these molecules can characterize binding efficiencies of BH3 family members, the biologic consequences of these interactions are difficult to predict. We have, therefore, established three functional categories of BH3-only human proapoptotic proteins based on their toxicity after expression in budding yeast: directly killing (tBid), sensitizing in Bax/Bcl-2 expressing cells (Bad or Puma), and non-toxic (BNip3, BNip3L, and Noxa). The mechanism of killing by the proapoptotic molecules in yeast, however, is not due to activation of the recently described yeast metacaspase MCA1."
https://openalex.org/W1983380636,"Although the p53 family members share a similar structure and function, it has become clear that they differ with respect to their role in development and tumor progression. Because of the high degree of homology in their DNA binding domains (DBDs), it is not surprising that both p63 and p73 activate the majority of p53 target genes. However, recent studies have revealed some differences in a subset of the target genes affected, and the mechanism underlying this diversity has only recently come under investigation. Our laboratory has demonstrated previously that p53 represses transcription of the P-glycoprotein-encoding MDR1 gene via direct DNA binding through a novel p53 DNA-binding site (the HT site). By transient transfection analyses, we now show that p63 and p73 activate rather than repress MDR1 transcription, and they do so through an upstream promoter element (the alternative p63/p73 element (APE)) independent of the HT site. This activation is dependent on an intact DNA binding domain, because mutations within the p63DBD or p73DBD are sufficient to prevent APE-mediated activation. However, neither p63 nor p73 directly interact with the APE, suggesting an indirect mechanism of activation through this site. Most interestingly, when the p53DBD is replaced by the p63DBD, p53 is converted from a repressor working through the HT site to an activator working through the APE. Taken together, these data indicate that, despite considerable homology, the DBD of the p53 family members have unique properties and can differentially regulate gene targeting and transcriptional output by both DNA binding-dependent and -independent mechanisms.

Given this high degree of homology, it is not surprising that p63 and p73 bind to the p53 consensus sequence and activate a large subset of p53 target genes, albeit with somewhat different efficiencies (7.Kartasheva N.N.

Despite these structural and functional similarities, several observations underscore fundamental differences among these family members with respect to their roles in oncogenesis and tissue development. First, although p63 and p73 were initially described as tumor suppressor proteins because of their localization to regions of the chromosome either deleted or altered in several cancer types (12.Herranz M.

Differential promoter utilization results in the loss of the amino-terminal transcriptional activation domain (TAD) (the ΔN forms) and the creation of dominant negative isoforms that can inhibit transcriptional activation by other family members on at least a subset of target genes (21.Grob T.J.

Most interestingly, high levels of certain p63 and p73 isoforms have been observed in some tumors, suggesting that these proteins may act as oncogenes rather than classic tumor suppressor proteins (24.Westfall M.D. Mays D.J.

Another notable difference among the homologues lies in their apparent roles in development, with p63 playing a critical role in epithelial stem cell renewal and epithelial homeostasis, and p73 contributing to neurogenesis (1.Irwin M.S. Kaelin W.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar). Among the first evidence for these roles was the observation that p63–/– and p73–/– mice each exhibit a distinct pattern of developmental defects that had not been observed in p53–/–animals. The p63–/–animals were born with severe craniofacial, limb, and epithelial cell defects (16.Yang A. Schweitzer R. Sun D. Kaghad M. Walker N. Bronson R.T. Tabin C. Sharpe A. Caput D. Crum C. McKeon F.

Nature. 1999; 398: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1674) Google Scholar), whereas p73–/–animals have congenital hydrocephalus, hippocampal dysgenesis, and defects in pheromone detection (15.Yang A.

These phenotypic differences demonstrate a subset of unique roles for each family member in both development (p63 and p73) and oncogenesis (p53). Wild-type p53 is best known as a transcriptional activator, an activity that is dependent on its interaction with a DNA consensus element consisting of two half-sites, each composed of two copies of the sequence PuPuPuC(A/T) (where Pu indicates purine) separated by 0–13 nucleotides. The role of p53 in transcriptional repression, although less well studied, has also been shown to be critical to its function in the apoptotic pathway (29.Zhu J. Zhang S. Jiang J. Chen X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39927-39934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30.Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4668-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Yet there have been very few queries of a similar role for p63 and p73. Nevertheless, due to clearly demonstrated functional differences among the homologues with respect to development and tumorigenicity, it seems important to identify and investigate any fundamental differences at the level of transcriptional regulation, including the effect of these homologues on p53-repressed genes. Our laboratory has a long standing interest in the transcriptional regulation of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-encoding MDR1 gene, which was first identified by virtue of its overexpression in multidrug-resistant tumor cells (31.Riordan J.R. Ling V. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 12701-12705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that Pgp plays a general anti-apoptotic role by conferring resistance to a variety of caspase-mediated apoptotic inducers in addition to chemotherapeutics (32.Johnstone R.W. Cretney E. Smyth M.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Smyth M.J. Krasovskis E. Sutton V.R. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moreover, expression of Pgp in critical organs such as the blood-brain barrier and colon epithelium impacts on drug pharmacokinetics and biodistribution (36.Schinkel A.H. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 37.Liu Y. Hu M. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2000; 38: 877-881PubMed Google Scholar). Given the multiple potential roles of MDR1/Pgp in tumor progression and drug response, an understanding of its regulation in normal and tumor cells is essential. MDR1 was one of the first promoters to be shown to be repressed by p53 (38.Chin K.V. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Science. 1992; 255: 459-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). More recently, we have dissected the mechanistic basis for this repression, and we identified a region within the MDR1 promoter consisting of an atypical p53 consensus sequence (the HT site) that mediates p53 repression by direct DNA binding (39.Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27716-27720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This site differs from the p53 consensus (activator) motif in that the quarter sites, which are arranged in a head-to-head (HH) configuration in the consensus motif, are arranged in a head-to-tail (HT) orientation within the MDR1 promoter. When p53 binds to this HT site, MDR1 transcription is repressed; when the HT site is converted to a consensus HH site within the context of the MDR1 promoter, transcription is activated. Thus, the orientation of the quarter sites within this promoter dictates the effect of the promoter-bound p53 on MDR1 transcription. In light of the high degree of homology within the DBDs of the p53 family members, and the numerous studies that have shown that the p53 homologues are capable of activating genes that contain the p53 consensus (HH) site, we sought to investigate the role of p63 and p73 on the p53-repressed MDR1 promoter. Most surprisingly, we found that both p63 and p73 activate, rather than repress, the MDR1 promoter. Moreover, this activation occurs independent of the HT site and is indirectly mediated by a novel upstream element. Finally, the difference in transcriptional effects of the p53 family members on MDR1 transcription is due, at least in part, to differences among their DNA binding domains. Cell Culture and Transfections—The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-AS (ATCC CRL-2137), the hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell line (ATCC HB-8065), and the lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1299 (ATCC CRL-5803) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units of penicillin/streptomycin per ml. Human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells (ATCC HTB-85) and the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line SW620 (ATCC CCL-227) were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 1:3 (DNA/FuGENE 6). For all transfections, DNA was added at a concentration of 2 μg/well (salmon sperm DNA was used as a carrier when needed). Luciferase activity was measured as described previously (39.Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27716-27720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), using the Luminoskan Ascent plate reader (ThermoLabSystems, Finland). Luciferase activity was normalized to protein concentration, determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). The luciferase activity of reporter constructs in the absence of exogenous p53, p63, or p73 was arbitrarily set at 1. Experiments were performed a minimum of three times in triplicate. Plasmids and Site-directed Mutagenesis—All mutant constructs were created using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The reporter constructs included pMDR1-HT (containing sequences from –1202 to +118 of the MDR1 promoter), pMDR1/–221 (–221 to +118), pMDR1/–136 (–136 to +118) (40.Jin S. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4377-4384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and pMDR1-HTmut (pMDR1-HT promoter mutated within the p53 HT site) (39.Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27716-27720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The pMDR1/–190 construct was engineered by inserting a SmaI site at position –190 of pMDR1-HT using the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GGAATGTTCTGGCTTCCGTccCgggTCTCTAGAAAGGGCAAG-3′ (the SmaI site is shown in boldface and mutated bases are in lowercase). The resulting construct was digested with SmaI and recircularized to generate pMDR1/–190. The p63 and p73 isoform expression vectors have been previously described (23.Zaika A.I. Slade N. Erster S.H.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pRC-p63γ (R304H) and pCDNA-p73α (R293H) were created using the following oligonucleotides: R304H, 5′-CGACGCTGCTTTGAGGCCCACATCTGTGCTTGCCCAGGAAG-3′; R293H, 5′-CGCCGGTCCTTTGAGGGCCACATCTG CGCCTGTCCTGGCCGC-3′. The p53/63DBD and p53/73DBD chimeric constructs were engineered as follows. NheI sites were placed at the 5′ and 3′ boundaries of the p63, p53, and p73DBD via site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant plasmids were digested with NheI, and the DBD fragments and vectors lacking the respective DBDs were isolated using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) following gel electrophoresis. Relevant vectors were ligated to a heterologous DBD, and the NheI sites were converted to wild-type sequences. The plasmids p53/63DBD and p53/73DBD include amino acids 141–320 of p63 or 131–310 of p73, respectively, in place of amino acids 112–290 of the p53DBD. Electromobility Shift Assays—p63γ and p73α proteins were prepared in vitro using the TnT Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System as described by the manufacturer (Promega, WI). Gel shift assays were performed as described previously with a few modifications (39.Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27716-27720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). SK-N-AS whole cell extract was prepared as follows. SK-N-AS cells were transfected with 12 μg of expression plasmid as described previously. Plates were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed with ice-cold buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). When indicated, 200 ng of one of the following antibodies was added: mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), p73 Ad-2 (Oncogene Research Products, MA), p63 (4A4) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or HA (HA-(Y11) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)). Oligonucleotides used as gel shift probes or for competition were as follows: con53, 5′-TTGGCTGGACATGCCCGGCGCCGGGGCGTGGGCATGTCCCAGCGC-3′; APE, 5′-GATGCGCGTTTCTCTACTTGCCCTTTCTAGAGAGGTGCA-3′; and HT, 5′-CGGCTGTGCTCAGCCCACGCCCCGGCGCTGTTCTGCCCAGCCAA-3′. RT-PCR—SK-N-AS cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 12 μg of expression construct; total RNA was extracted using Trizol as recommended by the vendor (Invitrogen). RT-PCRs were performed using SuperScript One-step RT-PCR as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). RNA at a concentration of 0.1 and 1.0 μg was used for G3PDH and MDR1 PCRs, respectively. The primers used for the PCRs are as follows: MDR1 forward, 5′-GGGATAAAGAAAGCTATTACAGCC-3′, and MDR1 reverse, 5′-ATCTGGTTTGTGCCCACTCT-3′; G3PDH (BD Biosciences), 5′-ATCTGGTTTGTGCCCACTCT-3′. Western Blot Analysis—5 × 105 SK-N-AS cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and transfected with 12 μg of expression construct. Plates were washed with ice-cold PBS, and cells were lysed with ice-cold RIPA buffer (1× PBS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and supernatant was collected. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). Western blotting was performed using 30 μg of protein electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The following antibodies were used: p73(H-79) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p63(4A4) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p53(Ab-6), p73(Ab-2), and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1000, and anti-mouse, anti-rabbit (Amersham Biosciences), or anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5000. Blots were developed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). p63 and p73 Activate Rather than Repress MDR1 Transcription—We have shown previously that wild-type p53 represses transcription of MDR1 through direct binding to a novel head-to-tail (HT) element within the proximal MDR1 promoter (39.Johnson R.A. Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27716-27720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). To assess a role for the p53 family members p63 and p73 on MDR1 transcription, we evaluated the effect of different isoforms of each protein on MDR1 promoter activity in a transient transfection assay. The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-AS (which does not express either p63 or p73) was co-transfected with the wild-type MDR1 luciferase expression construct pMDR1-HT and either empty vector or one of the predominant p63 or p73 isoforms (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis verified equivalent concentrations of both p63 isoforms (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and p73 isoforms (Fig. 2C, upper panel) in the transfectants. Most surprisingly, all three p73 isoforms (α, β, and γ) activated rather than repressed the MDR1 promoter; the relative strength of activation by the various p73 isoforms was consistent with what has been observed in the analyses of the effects of these isoforms on other promoters (7.Kartasheva N.N. Contente A. Lenz-Stoppler C. Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4715-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 8.Levrero M. De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Gong J. Wang J.Y. Melino G. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1661-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Melino G. De Laurenzi V. Vousden K.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). p63γ was also shown to activate MDR1 transcription, whereas p63α was a very weak activator; again, this difference in activation potential for p63 isoforms is consistent with what was observed for regulation of the promoter of p21 and other p53 target genes (45.Serber Z. Lai H.C. Yang A. Ou H.D. Sigal M.S. Kelly A.E. Darimont B.D. Duijf P.H. Van Bokhoven H. McKeon F. Dotsch V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8601-8611Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The failure of p63α to efficiently activate the MDR1 promoter suggested that MDR1 activation is dependent upon a transcriptionally competent form of the protein. To address this more fully, the ΔN forms of p63 and p73 that lack the amino-terminal TAD and are therefore transcriptionally compromised (Fig. 1) were co-transfected into SK-N-AS cells along with pMDR1-HT and protein expression quantitated by Western blot (Fig. 2, B and C, lower panels). As shown in Fig. 2D, ΔNp63γ was impaired in its ability to activate the MDR1 construct, resulting in approximately half the level of activation as was observed with p63γ; a similar reduction in activity was observed in a co-transfection analysis of the p21 promoter (data not shown and see Ref. 28.King K.E. Ponnamperuma R.M. Yamashita T. Tokino T. Lee L.A. Young M.F. Weinberg W.C. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3635-3644Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). That all activity is not lost upon deletion of the TAD is not completely unexpected, because it has been suggested that ΔNp63 may contain a second TAD and can in fact activate the transcription of a subset of genes (6.Yang A. Kaghad M. Wang Y. Gillett E. Fleming M.D. Dotsch V. Andrews N.C. Caput D. McKeon F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 305-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar, 46.Wu G. Nomoto S.

Biol. 2002; 22: 8659-8668Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The effect of deletion of the TAD was even more striking with respect to p73α, because ΔNp73α was unable to activate either the MDR1 promoter (Fig. 2D) or the p21 promoter (data not shown and see Ref. 21.Grob T.J. Novak U. Maisse C. Barcaroli D. Luthi A.U. Pirnia F. Hugli B. Graber H.U. De Laurenzi V. Fey M.F. Melino G. Tobler A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1213-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that activation of the MDR1 promoter by the p53 family members is dependent on the transcriptional activation competence of the protein. Most interestingly, when a similar experiment was performed in p53-deficient H1299 cells (Fig. 2E), neither p63 nor p73 isoforms were able to activate MDR1, indicating that activation may be cell line/tissue-specific. Although one difference between the SK-N-AS and H1299 cells is the status of p53 (wild-type and null, respectively), this does not appear to be the primary basis for the difference in activation by p63 and p73 because the SW620 cell line expressing mutant p53 (R273H) was able to support p63 and p73 activation (Fig. 2F), whereas the wild-type p53-expressing HepG2 cell line could not (Fig. 2G). To evaluate activation of the endogenous MDR1 gene by the p53 family members, either p63γ or p73α expression vectors were transiently transfected into SK-N-AS cells. RT-PCR analysis of MDR1 mRNA from transfected cells lines showed a substantial increase in MDR1 RNA in cells that expressed either p63γ (Fig. 2H, lane 2) or p73α (lane 5) as compared with the empty vector control (lane 1). However, no increase in MDR1 levels was observed in ΔNp63γ (lane 3) or ΔNp73α (lane 4) transfectants. G3PDH expression was unaffected by these proteins (Fig. 2H, lower panel). Thus, both the endogenous MDR1 gene as well as a transfected MDR1 promoter construct can be activated by the p53 homologues, and this activation is dependent on the amino-terminal activation domain. p63 and p73 Activate MDR1 Transcription through a Novel Upstream Element (the APE)—To addr"

We constructed three mutants, C33A/C173A, C135A/C165A, and all-Ala, to evaluate the contributions of individual disulfide bonds to the structure, stability, and biological functions of endostatin. Both tryptophan emission fluorescence spectrum and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum show that C135A/C165A and all-Ala, the two mutants lacking disulfide bond Cys135–Cys165, lost nearly their entire tertiary structure. Although C33A/C173A appears to retain some native-like structures, it is less stable and has a higher helical content, which confirms our earlier hypothesis that the polypeptide backbone of endostatin has a high helical propensity. C135A/C165A and all-Ala mutants lost most of their inhibitory activities both on the migration and proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells, whereas C33A/C173A is partially active. The mutants without disulfide bond Cys135–Cys165 can hardly be internalized and localized to cytoskeleton and nucleus in the cell, which probably contributes to their loss of inhibition on the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The former disulfide bond connects helix α1 (longer α-helix) to the central β-sheet and the latter circularizes a twisted loop containing three strands (5Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Our group recently reported that ES is acid-resistant with slow kinetics upon acid-induced unfolding (7Li B. Wu X.Y. Zhou H. Chen Q.J. Luo Y.Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2550-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The disulfide bonds are very difficult to access in native ES, because they cannot be completely reduced in the absence of denaturants (7Li B. Wu X.Y. Zhou H. Chen Q.J. Luo Y.Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2550-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These properties are proposed to be attributed to the existence of a nested pattern of disulfide bonds (7Li B. Wu X.Y. Zhou H. Chen Q.J. Luo Y.Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2550-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds are one of the significant interactions for protein native conformations, stabilities, and activities (8Hirs C.H.W. J. Biol.

In order to elucidate the functions of the two disulfide bonds in ES, each of the two individual disulfide bonds was mutated by substituting cysteine residues with alanine, which is a conservative change (18Suganuma N. Matzuk M.M. Boime I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19302-19307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine residues are widely found in the secondary structures of proteins such as α-helix, β-sheet, and turns (19Luo Y. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5283-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1984: 1-9Google Scholar). The mutations to Ala do not make any specific side chain interactions to affect protein stabilities (19Luo Y. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5283-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1984: 1-9Google Scholar). Serine is structurally similar to cysteine except that it contains a hydroxyl group instead of a thiol group (21Milanez S. Mural R.J. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10694-10699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can also be used to replace cysteine residues of proteins (22Firsov D. Robert-Nicoud M. Gruender S. Schild L.

However, serine may not be suitable for replacing cysteine residues in ES because 1) serine tends to disrupt α-helices (20Creighton T.E. Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H.

Nature. 1984; 307: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and 2) the polypeptide backbone of ES appears to have a high helical propensity as reported by our group (7Li B. Wu X.Y. Zhou H. Chen Q.J. Luo Y.Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2550-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A total of three mutants were constructed: C33A/C173A, C135A/C165A, and all-Ala (Fig. 1). These mutants were subjected to conformational analyses by Trp fluorescence emission, CD, 1H NMR, stability measurements with denaturants, and biological activity evaluation on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs). C33A/C173A was found to retain some of the native structures, stabilities, and biological functions. In contrast, mutants C135A/C165A and all-Ala lost almost all of their tertiary structures and biological functions. When the disulfide bond Cys33–Cys173 is mutated, both C33A/C173A and all-Ala gain much increased helical contents compared with wild type ES. This observation confirms our earlier hypothesis that the polypeptide backbone of ES may have an intrinsic high α-helical propensity (7Li B. Wu X.Y. Zhou H. Chen Q.J. Luo Y.Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2550-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Without any disulfide bonds, all-Ala has the least native conformation and the lowest stability and activity but the highest helical propensity. Dixelius et al. reported that ES can be internalized by endothelial cells (32Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L. Engstrom A. Timpl R. Welsh M. Claesson-Welsh L. Blood. 2000; 95: 3403-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, ES is believed to be involved in the interaction of cytoskeleton components (32Dixelius J. Larsson H. Sasaki T. Holmqvist K. Lu L.

Cancer Lett. 2003; 196: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between cytoskeleton proteins and ES has not been elucidated at the molecular level. Our results show that lacking disulfide bonds impairs the internalization and localization of ES to cytoskeleton of endothelial cells, which results in the decrease of inhibitory activities of ES both on the migration and proliferation of HMECs. These observations may help to evaluate the contributions of disulfide bonds on the structures of ES and the correlation between structures and the biological functions of ES. Construction of Mutants and Protein Expression—Constructs for ES mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis using a wild type ES construct in pET25b (Novagen) as the template (Fig. 1). DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the correct introduction of mutations. The recombinant wild type ES and its mutants have MGGSHHHHH at their N termini. Protein Purification—Plasmids encoding human wild type ES or its mutants were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) strain. Wild type ES and its mutants were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli and purified via an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen). Wild type ES and its mutants were refolded and purified by Protgen. Protein concentrations were determined according to Edelhoch's method (39Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3006) Google Scholar). Measurements of Tryptophan Emission Fluorescence—Trp emission fluorescence of ES was measured with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrophotometer using cuvettes with an optical path length of 1 cm. The temperature was maintained constantly at 20 °C using an external bath circulator. Trp emission fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 288 nm. The excitation wavelength at 288 nm was chosen because ES contains four Trp residues, and excitation at 288 nm ensures fluorescence emission mainly contributed by Trp residues. The emission spectra were measured from 300 nm to 400 nm (excitation and emission slit width = 5 nm). The scan speed was 240 nm/min. The concentration of wild type or mutants was 0.9 μm in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Circular Dichroism Measurements—Far-UV CD was recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter equipped with a temperature-controlled liquid system. A stock of ES was diluted in 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) by aliquots to a final protein concentration of 5 μm. Cuvettes of 2-mm path length were used over the wavelength range between 200 and 250 nm. Spectral acquisition was taken at 0.2-nm intervals with 4-s integration time and a bandwidth of 1.0 nm. An average of four scans was obtained for all of the spectra. Photomultiplier absorbance did not exceed 600 V in the spectral region analyzed. Data were corrected for buffer contributions and smoothed using the software provided by the manufacturer. All of the measurements were performed under nitrogen flow. The results are expressed as mean residue ellipticity, [θ], in units of degrees cm2 dmol–1. A mean residue weight of 110 was used for the peptide chromophore. Hydrogen Exchange and 1H NMR Measurements—The concentration of wild type ES or its mutants was adjusted to 200 μm in 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 16% D2O. The samples were then incubated at 20 °C for 100 min before NMR measurement. 1H NMR spectroscopy was taken at 500 MHz on a Varian Inova 500NB instrument. NMR spectra were acquired using a spectral width of 8000.0 Hz, a relaxation delay of 1.0 s, and 128 repetitions. pH Titration—Wild type ES or its mutants were first dissolved in 30 mm acetate (pH 5.5) to make a stock solution, which was then diluted by aliquots into 4 mm acetate buffer at different pH values. 1 m HCl was used to adjust pH when pH values were lower than 3.5. The final protein concentration was 0.9 μm. Trp emission fluorescence measurements were carried out immediately after the samples were incubated at 20 °C for 100 min. However, the incubation time of mutants was reduced to 30 min because of their faster equilibration process. Urea-induced Unfolding—A stock solution of ES was diluted by aliquots into different concentrations of urea to reach a final protein concentration of 0.9 μm. The buffer used was 5 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4. After incubation at 20 °C for 120 min (wild type) or 30 min (mutants), Trp emission fluorescence measurements were carried out. Data Analysis—Unfolding curves were analyzed by a two-state equation with linear base lines, according to the procedure of Santoro and Bolen that uses data inside as well as outside the transition zone to fix the base lines (40Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Both C135A/C165A and all-Ala cannot be normalized to two-state curves because of the marginal stability and the difficulties in finding their base lines. Proteolysis Assay—Wild type ES or its mutants were diluted in PBS to 14 μm. Trypsin (0.25 units/ml) was added and incubated with ES at 0 or 37 °C. The reactions were terminated at different time intervals by adding Laemmli SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. The digested wild type ES or its mutants were then analyzed on 12% SDS gels followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Cell Culture—Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) and ECV304 cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Cell Migration—The motility of HMECs was measured by using a modified Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Inc.) assay. Briefly, to inhibit the migration of HMECs, lower chambers were filled with DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS containing wild type ES or its mutants at concentrations ranging from 4 mg/ml to 0.4 ng/ml or saline as a control. HMECs (1 × 104) were added to the upper chambers in DMEM, supplemented with 0.2% FBS and 10 ng/ml bFGF. The cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 h, after which the number of cells migrated to the lower surface was counted. The migration results were expressed as the average number of cells per high magnification optical microscopic (×400) field. Five fields were counted for each assay. Each sample was assayed in tetrad, and the assays were repeated twice. Cell Proliferation—Wild type ES or its mutants were assayed for their inhibitory activities on the proliferation of HMECs stimulated by bFGF (5 ng/ml) with the Colorimetric Assay for Cell Survival and Proliferation Kit (Chemicon International) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HMECs were inoculated into DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. HMECs grown to 70% confluence were serum-deprived in DMEM for 12 h and then treated for 48 h with 0.6–60 μg/ml wild type ES or its mutants supplemented with 2% FBS and 5 ng/ml bFGF at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (50 μg/ml) was added into the culture and mixed by tapping gently on the side of the tray. After incubating at 37 °C for 4 h, 100 μl of color development solution (isopropyl alcohol with 0.04 m HCl) was added into each well and mixed thoroughly by repeated pipetting with a multichannel pipettor. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the absorbance at 570 nm was measured on an ELISA plate reader with a reference wavelength of 630 nm. Each sample was assayed in hexad, and the assays were repeated twice. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as mean values ± S.E. Multiple comparisons were performed by one-way analysis of variance, and differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Immunofluorescence Analysis—HMECs were plated into 24-well plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 24 h. After they were serum-deprived in DMEM for 12 h, HMECs were supplemented with 2% FBS and 5 ng/ml bFGF. The cells were then treated with 10 μg/ml wild type ES or its mutants for 8 h. The treated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and finally incubated with 1:200 rabbit anti-ES polyclonal antibodies in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin followed by incubation with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The fields were photographed under the TRITC wavelength with an Olympus fluorescence microscope. Internalization Assays of Labeled Endostatin—Wild type ES and its mutants were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin by the EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-LC biotinylation kit (Pierce) in PBS. HMECs or ECV304 cells were plated on 24-well plates and cultured as described in the immunofluorescence assay. After 8 h of serum deprivation, the cells were incubated in DMEM medium, 2% FBS, and 5 ng/ml bFGF containing 10 μg/ml biotin-labeled wild type ES or its mutants (as described in the legend to Fig. 9). At different time intervals, the treated cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 on ice. After they were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h, the cells were incubated with 1:300 TRITC-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) in PBS, 0.2% Tween 20, 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The fields were photographed under the TRITC wavelength with an Olympus fluorescence microscope. Effect of Disulfide Bonds on the Structure of Endostatin— The tryptophan fluorescence emission was used to monitor the conformational changes of wild type ES or its mutants. The maximal Trp fluorescence emission wavelength of wild type ES is at 320 nm, whereas that of C33A/C173A and C135A/C165A red shift to 320 and 335 nm, respectively (Fig. 2A). Not surprisingly, the maximal emission wavelength of all-Ala is even at about 340 nm, which is close to a completely denatured state (Fig. 2A). In order to have a more precise measurement of conformational changes, NMR was employed. Since all-Ala is not very stable at neutral pH, the 1H NMR spectra of wild type and its mutants were therefore taken at pH 6.0, at which the wild type ES still retains its native conformation (7Li B. Wu X.Y. Zhou H. Chen Q.J. Luo Y.Z. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2550-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas the mutants appear to have the same conformation as at neutral pH with low protein concentrations (see Fig. 3E). In the NMR spectra, the up-field chemical shifts of methyl peaks, the sharp chemical shift dispersions in the aromatic region, and spreading out of the histidine 1Hϵ1 resonances are all characteristic properties of tightly packed native proteins. These characters are present not only in the NMR spectrum of wild type ES but also in that of C33A/C173A, suggesting that this mutant retains some native-like conformations. Although C135A/C165A also retains some native structures, the chemical shift dispersion at the aromatic region becomes broader, and the number of peaks below 0 ppm is reduced significantly. No tertiary structures were detected in all-Ala based on its NMR spectrum (Fig. 2C). The secondary structures of ES contain a large fraction of loop structures and β-sheets and only a small fraction of α-helices (5Hohenester E. Sasaki T. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1656-1664Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The helical contents of mutants C33A/C173A and C135A/C165A are about 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared with that of the wild type based on far-UV CD measurements at 222 nm. All-Ala has the highest helical content among all three mutants, greater than 2-fold wild type (Fig. 2B). pH Titration of Endostatin Wild Type and Its Mutants—The pH titration behaviors of ES mutants vary according to the locations of the disulfide bonds (Table I). The Trp fluorescence emission spectra of acid-induced unfolding of wild type ES and its mutants are red-shifted, and their fluorescence intensity decreases significantly upon unfolding (Fig. 3, A–D). As monitored by Trp fluorescence emission, wild type ES begins unfolding at about pH 3.5; on the other hand, mutants C135A/C165A and C33A/C173A cannot retain their native tertiary structures even at pH 4.0 and 5.0, respectively (Fig. 3E). These two mutants have different slopes in the unfolding transition regions. The transition region of C135A/C165A is between pH 4.0 and 2.5, whereas that of C33A/C173A is between pH 5.0 and 2.5.Table IStability measurements of wild type endostatin and its mutantsWild typeC33A/C173AC135A/C165AAll-AlapH valueaThe pH value of the midpoint of acid-induced unfolding transition of ES.2.74.33.14.9[urea] (m)4.1bThe urea concentration of the midpoint of urea-induced unfolding transition of ES (Cm value).2.6bThe urea concentration of the midpoint of urea-induced unfolding transition of ES (Cm value).7.0cThe urea concentration of completely unfolded ES.4.0cThe urea concentration of completely unfolded ES.6.0cThe urea concentration of completely unfolded ES.3.0cThe urea concentration of completely unfolded ES.m (cal·mol-1·m-1)dm, the apparent m value defined by the linear extrapolation model.11842147a The pH value of the midpoint of acid-induced unfolding transition of ES.b The urea concentration of the midpoint of urea-induced unfolding transition of ES (Cm value).c The urea concentration of completely unfolded ES.d m, the apparent m value defined by the linear extrapolation model. Open table in a new tab Stability Measurements of Endostatin Wild Type and Its Mutants—The stabilities of ES mutants vary with different disulfide bonds as expected. Urea-induced unfolding of wild type ES and its mutants was monitored by measuring the intrinsic Trp fluorescence emission. The Trp fluorescence emission spectra are red-shifted, and their fluorescence intensity increases significantly upon unfolding (Fig. 4, A–D). The unfolding curves show that unfolding of wild type and C33A/C173A, but not the other two mutants, can be described as a two-state process (Fig. 4, E and F). Wild type ES has a Cm of 4.1 m, which is more stable than all of the mutants. C33A/C173A unfolds with a Cm of 2.6 m. It has a sharp unfolding curve with an m value of 2147 cal·mol–1·m–1. C135A/C165A, of which the unfolding is not a two-state process, unfolds completely in 6 m urea. The unfolding of all-Ala is completed in 3 m urea via a noncooperative mechanism (Table I). Proteolysis Stability of Endostatin Wild Type and Its Mutants—Endostatin is relatively stable against trypsin. It requires up to 60 min to be digested completely to an 18-kDa fragment at 37 °C; this fragment appears to be trypsin-resistant (Fig. 5). The proteolysis stabilities of mutants vary. C33A/C173A is almost as resistant to trypsin as wild type, and it can also be digested to the 18-kDa fragment. Mutant C135A/C165A was completely digested by trypsin (37 °C, 10 min) to smearing fragments based on SDS-PAGE analysis. Surprisingly, all-Ala, the unstable protein against denaturants, is more resistant to trypsin digestion than wild type ES (Fig. 5). Effects of Disulfide Bonds on the Inhibitory Activity of Endostatin in the Migration of HMECs—Wild type ES inhibits angiogenesis stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor or bFGF (2O'Reilly M.S.

The production of this ligand is catalyzed by the enzyme glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, which utilizes α-d-glucose 1-phosphate and MgCTP as substrates. Previous x-ray crystallographic investigations have demonstrated that the Salmonella typhi enzyme complexed with the product CDP-glucose is a fully integrated hexamer displaying 32 point group symmetry. The binding pocket for CDP-glucose is shared between two subunits. Here we describe both a detailed kinetic analysis of the cytidylyltransferase and a structural investigation of the enzyme complexed with MgCTP. These data demonstrate that the reaction catalyzed by the cytidylyltransferase proceeds via a sequential rather than a Bi Bi ping-pong mechanism as was previously reported. Additionally, the enzyme utilizes both CTP and UTP equally well as substrates. The structure of the enzyme with bound MgCTP reveals that the binding pocket for the nucleotide is contained within one subunit rather than shared between two. Key side chains involved in nucleotide binding include Thr14, Arg15, Lys25, and Arg111. In the previous structure of the enzyme complexed with CDP-glucose, those residues defined by Thr14 to Ile21 were disordered. The kinetic and x-ray crystallographic data presented here support a mechanism for this enzyme that is similar to that reported for the glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferases.

O-Antigens are glycan side chains of bacterial surface lipopolysaccharides that play a role in pathogenicity and are recognized by the immunological defense system of the host (1Samuel G. Reeves P. Carbohydr. Res. 2003; 338: 2503-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Tyvelose, as shown in Scheme 1, is a 3,6-dideoxyhexose that occurs in the O-antigens of some types of Gram-negative bacteria such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis IVA and Salmonella typhi (2He X.M. Liu H.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 701-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It is produced via a complex biochemical pathway that employs α-d-glucose 1-phosphate as the starting ligand. The first committed step in the pathway, as shown in Scheme 1, is the transfer of a CMP moiety from CTP to glucose 1-phosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by α-d-glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, which was first purified in the early 1960s from various bacterial species (3Ginsburg V. O'Brien J. Hall C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1962; 7: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 4Mayer R.M. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1900-1904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nikaido H.

These initial reports established the kinetic parameters of the enzyme and were in general agreement despite the varying sources of protein. All of the studies demonstrated that the cytidylyltransferase has a strict preference for CTP, with only trace activity in the presence of dCTP and UTP, and no measurable activity with any other NTP or dNTP (4Mayer R.M. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1900-1904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kimata K. Suzuki S. J. Biol.

The enzyme was shown to have maximal activity at pH ∼8 and to display feedback inhibition by CDP-paratose, CDP-tyvelose, and other intermediates in the production of CDP-tyvelose (4Mayer R.M. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1900-1904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Nikaido H. Nikaido K. J. Biol.

Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3789-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the type of inhibition observed was consistent with multiple binding sites for the inhibitor. The overall reaction was shown to be readily reversible with an equilibrium constant in the direction of CDP-glucose formation of 0.57 to 1.0 (4Mayer R.M. Ginsburg V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1900-1904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kimata K. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1099-1113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These initial reports also indicated that the quaternary structure of the enzyme was monomeric with an overall molecular weight of 110,000 (7Rubenstein P.A. Strominger J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3789-3796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following these earlier studies, highly purified samples of α-d-glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase were subsequently obtained from Salmonella enterica strain LT2, Y. pseudotuberculosis, and Streptomyces glaucescens GLA.0 (8Lindqvist L. Kaiser R. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 122-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Thorson J.S. Kelly T.M. Liu H.W. J.

In contrast, these investigations indicated the quaternary structure of the enzyme to be tetrameric rather than monomeric with a subunit molecular weight of ∼30,000 (9Thorson J.S. Kelly T.M. Liu H.W. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1840-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A detailed kinetic analysis of the cytidylyltransferase from S. enterica suggested that its catalytic mechanism proceeds via a Bi Bi ping-pong reaction (8Lindqvist L. Kaiser R. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 122-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In such a mechanism, CTP binds first to the enzyme followed by an attack of an enzymatic base on the α-phosphorus of the nucleotide, resulting in the formation of an enzyme-CMP covalent intermediate and the release of pyrophosphate. Glucose 1-phosphate subsequently binds and conducts a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus of the enzyme-CMP intermediate resulting in CDP-glucose formation. Strikingly, this mode of catalysis is in sharp contrast to the sequential mechanism reported for the related glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferases (11Zuccotti S. Zanardi D. Rosano C. Sturla L. Tonetti M. Bolognesi M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 831-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Barton W.A. Lesniak J. Biggins J.B. Jeffrey P.D. Jiang J. Rajashankar K.R. Thorson J.S. Nikolov D.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Recently, the x-ray crystallographic structure of the S. typhi glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase complexed with CDP-glucose was determined in this laboratory (13Koropatkin N.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44023-44029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The enzyme crystallized in the space group P6322 with one subunit in the asymmetric unit. Contrary to previous reports, the crystallographic data clearly demonstrated the enzyme to be a fully integrated hexamer displaying 32 point group symmetry. Subsequent analytical ultracentrifugation experiments confirmed the hexameric nature of the cytidylyltransferase (13Koropatkin N.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44023-44029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A view of one-half of the hexamer is shown in Fig. 1. Note that each active site is formed by residues contributed from two subunits, specifically those related by the crystallographic dyads. Each subunit displays a “bird-like” appearance with the “body” dominated by a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet and the two “wings” formed by β-hairpin motifs. Here we present both a detailed kinetic analysis of the enzyme and the three-dimensional structure of the protein complexed with CTP. These biochemical and x-ray crystallographic data indicate that the reaction proceeds via a sequential mechanism, that the enzyme can utilize both UTP and CTP, that the binding site for CTP is contained within a single subunit of the hexamer, and that the wings of each subunit adopt different orientations when CTP versus CDP-glucose is bound in the active site. Protein Purification—The S. typhi glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase was purified according to previously published procedures (13Koropatkin N.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44023-44029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma. The concentrations of CTP, CDP-glucose, UTP, and UDP-glucose were determined by UV spectrophotometry assuming extinction coefficients at 271 nm of 9.3 mm-1 cm-1 for CTP and CDP-glucose and 10.3 mm-1 cm-1 for UTP and UDP-glucose. Enzymatic Assays for the Forward and Reverse Reactions—The activity of glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase in the forward reaction was followed by two spectrophotometric methods. Absorbance readings were taken with a Beckman DU 640B spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature-controlled 6-cell autosampler. The substrate specificity of cytidylyltransferase was assessed in a coupled assay in which the production of pyrophosphate was linked to the oxidation of NADH. These assays were performed in a discontinuous manner utilizing the pyrophosphate detection kit from Sigma (product P-7275). The pyrophosphate detection kit contained the coupling enzymes pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, aldolase, triose-phosphate isomerase, and glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, as well as the appropriate substrates. For this set of experiments, the pyrophosphate reagent was prepared by resuspending one vial of the lyophilized reagent mixture in 2 ml of sterile water, rather than the recommended 4 ml. The assay was initiated by the addition of cytidylyltransferase (18 μl, 0.25 μg/μl) to 3 ml of solution containing 1–2 mm NTP, 3–4 mm MgCl2, 1–2 mm of various sugar 1-phosphates, and 25 mm HEPPS (pH 8.0). At various times (0 min to 24 h), 800 μl were removed and quenched by the addition of 40 μl of 2 m HCl and 20 μl of CCl4 followed by 30 s of vortexing. These aliquots were subsequently centrifuged for 1 min and 800 μl were withdrawn and transferred to a Microfuge tube containing 35 μl of 2 m NaOH to neutralize the pH. To this solution, 165 μl of the pyrophosphate reagent were added and the reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The amount of pyrophosphate produced over time was assessed by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm according to the manufacturer's instructions. Negative controls were performed in which cytidylyltransferase, CTP, or glucose 1-phosphate were omitted from the reaction. The kinetic constants for the cytidylyltransferase forward reaction were assessed via a continuous coupled assay for the detection of pyrophosphate. Unfortunately, an unidentified contaminant in the Sigma pyrophosphate detection kit acted as a substrate for the cytidylyltransferase reaction when only CTP or UTP were added to the reaction. Therefore, this kit could not be used to perform a continuous assay. Instead, the individual reagents of the kit were purchased from Sigma and the pyrophosphate reagent was reconstituted from the individual components. Each 350-μl reaction contained 14.4 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 1.6 mm citrate, 32 μm EDTA, 64 μm MnCl2, 6.4 μm CoCl2, 256μmβ-NADH, 3.8 mm fructose 6-phosphate, 0.06 units of pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, 0.6 units of glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, 5.6 units of triose-phosphate isomerase, 0.84 units of aldolase, 0.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 0.35 μg of cytidylyltransferase, and varying amounts of CTP with MgCl2 and glucose 1-phosphate. CTP was varied from 50 μm to 1 mm at fixed levels of glucose 1-phosphate in the range of 25 μm to 1 mm. The MgCl2 concentration was fixed at 2.5 mm above the concentration of CTP in each reaction. 40 μl of the variable substrate, glucose 1-phosphate or CTP and MgCl2, were transferred to a quartz cuvette and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 310 μl containing the remaining reaction components. The reaction was quickly mixed and the absorbance at 340 nm was monitored every 15 s over 7 min. During this time, the reactions were kept at a constant temperature of 26 °C. The continuous assay was also performed varying α-d-xylose 1-phosphate while keeping the concentration of CTP fixed at 1 mm. Similarly, the concentrations of dCTP or UTP were varied while maintaining the concentration of glucose 1-phosphate at 1 mm. In the assays involving dCTP and xylose 1-phosphate, 20 times the concentration of cytidylyltransferase was required to achieve an observable reaction velocity. To compare reaction velocities, the rate of the reaction with CTP and glucose 1-phosphate at this higher enzyme concentration was also measured. Control experiments for the continuous assay were performed in which cytidylyltransferase, glucose 1-phosphate, or NTP were omitted from the assay to ensure that pyrophosphate production did not occur unless both of the substrates and cytidylyltransferase were present. The products of the reaction with CTP, UTP, glucose 1-phosphate, and xylose 1-phosphate were identified via HPLC 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HEPPS, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid. analysis. HPLC analysis of the reaction products was performed on an ÄKTA HPLC (Amersham Biosciences) equipped with a 1-ml Resource Q column using two different sets of conditions. The reaction products were analyzed at pH 4.0 with a gradient of 20 to 500 mm ammonium acetate over 20 ml and at pH 8.5 with a gradient of 20 to 500 mm ammonium carbonate over 20 ml. The products of the reaction were identified by comparing the chromatograms to those of authentic samples of CMP, UMP, CDP, UDP, CDP-glucose, UDP-glucose, CTP, or UTP. The kinetic constants for the reverse (NTP synthesis) reaction were determined via a discontinuous HPLC assay. Each 1–5-ml reaction contained 1 μg/ml cytidylyltransferase and 25 mm HEPPS (pH 8.0), whereas the concentrations of CDP-glucose and sodium pyrophosphate or UDP-glucose and sodium pyrophosphate were varied over the range of 20 μm to 10 mm. The concentration of MgCl2 was fixed at 2 mm above the concentration of pyrophosphate. Reaction aliquots were removed at various times and quenched with HCl and carbon tetrachloride as described for the discontinuous coupled assay. One-ml samples of the reaction were injected onto a 1-ml Resource Q column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 4.0). The NTP product was separated from the nucleotide 5′-diphosphate-glucose substrate with a linear gradient from 0 to 300 mm LiCl over 20 ml. The elution profile was monitored by UV absorbance at 271 nm. The retention volumes for CDP-glucose, CTP, UDP-glucose, and UTP were 9.2, 13.4, 9.7, and 15.3 ml, respectively. The area under the elution peak for UTP and CTP was calculated and compared with a standard curve relating the area under the elution peak to the micromoles of NTP. Measurement of the Equilibrium Constant and Divalent Cation Dependence—The equilibrium constant and Mg2+ dependence for the cytidylyltransferase reaction were assessed via an HPLC-based assay to detect the relative proportion of CDP-glucose to CTP and vice versa. For the measurement of the equilibrium constant, the standard reaction contained 1 mm each of sodium pyrophosphate and CDP-glucose or 1 mm each of CTP and glucose 1-phosphate, 3 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm HEPPS (pH 8.0). Each 1-ml reaction contained 2.5 μg of cytidylyltransferase. To determine the dependence of the cytidylyltransferase reaction on the concentration of Mg2+, CTP and glucose 1-phosphate were fixed at 0.2 and 1 mm, respectively, whereas the concentration of MgCl2 was varied from 0.7 to 5.2 mm. These 1-ml reactions contained 1.0 μg of cytidylyltransferase. The reaction products were separated on a 1-ml Resource Q column with a linear gradient of 20 to 250 mm ammonium carbonate (pH 8.5) over 20 ml. The elution profile was monitored by UV absorbance at 271 nm and the area under the peaks was used to determine the proportion of CDP-glucose to CTP. Kinetic Data Analysis—The kinetic constants for the forward reaction were assessed using the data obtained from the continuous spectrophotometric assay. Before the final data analysis, the initial velocity pattern was determined by plotting each data set to the equation. 1v=(KV)1A+(1V) (Eq. 1) The double reciprocal plot clearly showed a series of intersecting lines suggesting a sequential mechanism (Fig. 2). Therefore, all 60 data points from the continuous assay with CTP and glucose 1-phosphate were fitted to Equation 2. v=VABKiaKb+KaB+KbA+AB (Eq. 2) The data were fitted with the program SEQUENO to calculate V, Ka, Kb, Kia, and Kib from Kib = (Kia Kb)/Ka, where Kia and Kib are the dissociation constants for binary EA and EB complexes, Ka and Kb are Michaelis constants for A and B, and V is the maximum velocity (14Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). In this equation, A is the concentration of CTP, whereas B is the concentration of glucose 1-phosphate. The kinetic parameters for the back reaction and for the alternate substrates for the forward reaction were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 3) of the form. v=VAK+A (Eq. 3) Crystallization of Glucose-1-phosphate Cytidylyltransferase—Prior to crystallization, the protein was concentrated to 9.5 mg/ml. CTP and MgCl2 were added to final concentrations of 4 and 8 mm, respectively. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion against a precipitant solution containing 24–28% poly(ethylene glycol) 400, 100 mm MgCl2, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0). The crystals belonged to the space group P6322 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 84.2, c = 157.4, and one subunit per asymmetric unit. X-ray Data Collection and Structural Analysis—Prior to x-ray data collection, the crystals were serially transferred from the hanging drop experiments to a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% poly(ethylene glycol) 400, 10% ethylene glycol, 400 mm NaCl, 100 mm MgCl2, 4 mm CTP, and 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), flash-cooled to -150 °C in a stream of nitrogen vapor, and stored under liquid nitrogen until synchrotron beam time became available. X-ray data from a single crystal were collected on a CCD detector at the COM-CAT 32-ID beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). All x-ray data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALE-PACK (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

The control experiments, however, indicated that pyrophosphate was produced even when only CTP and cytidylyltransferase were added to the coupling enzymes. The products from the reaction containing CTP, coupling reagent, and cytidylyltransferase were verified by HPLC and indicated that in the absence of glucose 1-phosphate, a compound consistent with the HPLC profile of CDP-glucose was produced. In addition, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on the product of this reaction showed that it had the same molecular weight as CDP-glucose. It should be noted that CMP was not detected as a product of this reaction nor was it detected in prolonged incubations of cytidylyltransferase, CTP, and MgCl2. Because the pyrophosphate reagent in the detection kit appeared contaminated with a substrate for the cytidylyltransferase reaction, this reagent could only be utilized to perform a discontinuous assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In this set of assays, CTP, dCTP, UTP, dUTP, ATP, and GTP were tested for activity with glucose 1-phosphate. Similarly, d-glucose 1-phosphate, d-xylose 1-phosphate, d-mannose 1-phosphate, d-galactose 1-phosphate, d-fructose 6-phosphate, and d-glucose 6-phosphate were tested as substrates with CTP. Only reactions containing CTP, dCTP, UTP, glucose 1-phosphate, and xylose 1-phosphate produced detectable levels of pyrophosphate. The kinetic parameters of the cytidylyltransferase reaction with these substrates were further assessed in a continuous assay system. To confirm the identity of the products from the cytidylyltransferase reaction in the forward direction, samples of the reaction with CTP, dCTP, UTP, glucose 1-phosphate, and xylose 1-phosphate were analyzed by HPLC. The substrate and product peaks from the reaction were identified by comparing the retention volumes to those of known samples of CTP, CDP, CMP, CDP-glucose, UTP, UDP, UMP, and UDP-glucose at both pH 8.5 and 4.0. In all reactions, the only product identified was the nucleotide 5′-diphosphate-sugar, with no concomitant formation of nucleotide 5′-monophosphate. In addition, prolonged incubation of cytidylyltransferase with CTP or UTP did not result in CMP or UMP formation, confirming that the enzyme does not perform a pyrophorylysis side reaction. Thus it can be concluded that the measurement of pyrophosphate is an appropriate method to determine the kinetics of product formation. The kinetic constants for the forward cytidylyltransferase reaction were determined using a continuous assay coupling the production of pyrophosphate to the oxidation of NADH. To establish whether the cytidylyltransferase reaction follows a sequential or ping-pong mechanism, the glucose 1-phosphate concentration was varied at several fixed concentrations of CTP while measuring the initial velocity of the reaction. Double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity with respect to substrate concentration resulted in a series of lines that intersected in the lower left quadrant as shown in Fig. 2. The initial velocity pattern is consistent with a sequential mechanism for cytidylyltransferase. This is in sharp contrast to that previously reported for the Salmonella glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase that suggested a ping-pong mechanism on the basis of double reciprocal plots of the initial velocity pattern (8Lindqvist L. Kaiser R. Reeves P.R. Lindberg A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 122-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial velocity data in the present investigation were fitted to the rate equation for a sequential mechanism using the least-squares fitting program SEQUENO (14Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). The data fit the rate equation for a sequential mechanism well with σ = 0.18 μm/min for the initial velocity values. The results from this analysis are reported in Table III. The Km for CTP (Ka)is148 ± 7 μm and the Km for glucose 1-phosphate (Kb) is 52 ± 2 μm. The Vmax for the forward reaction with CTP and glucose 1-phosphate is 10.4 ± 0.2 μm/min. The dissociation constants (Ki) of CTP and glucose 1-phosphate are 35 ± 8 and 12 ± 3 μm, respectively. The fact that the dissociation constants are lower than the Km values for CTP and glucose 1-phosphate argues that the substrates bind in an anti-synergistic fashion in the forward reaction.Table IIIKinetic parameters for the forward reaction with CTP and glucose 1-phosphate These parameters were generated from a least-squares fit of the data to the rate equation for a sequential mechanism, assuming A = CTP and B = glucose 1-phosphate. The fit gave σ = 0.18 μm/min.Vmax110.4 (±0.2) μm/minKA148 (±7) μmKB52 (±2) μmKia35 (±8) μmKib12 (±3) μm Open table in a new tab The continuous assay was also utilized to determine the kinetic parameters from the reaction with UTP and glucose 1-phosphate, dCTP and glucose 1-phosphate, and CTP and xylose 1-phosphate. The Km for UTP is 159 ± 8 μm and the Vmax of the reaction is 15.4 ± 0.3 μm/min. The ratio of the Vmax of the reaction with UTP versus CTP is 1.5 ± 0.04, suggesting that the rates of the reaction with UTP or CTP are essentially the same. These data indicate that the enzyme appears to utilize CTP and UTP equally well, a finding that has not been reported for any other hexose 1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase or uridylyltransferase. However, the rate of the reaction is severely decreased when CTP is replaced with dCTP. The Km for dCTP is 3.0 ± 0.5 mm, which is 20 times greater than the Km for CTP and the rate of the reaction is 30% that of the reaction with CTP. Of the hexose 1-phosphates tested, only xylose 1-phosphate acted as a substrate in the forward reaction. The Km for xylose 1-phosphate is 3.6 ± 0.3 mm, which is 72 times greater than the Km for glucose 1-phosphate. The rate of the reaction with xylose 1-phosphate, however, is ∼40% faster than the reaction with glucose 1-phosphate. This rate increase could be explained if the product CDP-xylose has a low affinity for the enzyme in which case the product release step for CDP-xylose would be much faster than that for CDP-glucose. This would give a higher apparent velocity for the reaction of CTP and xylose 1-phosphate. The equilibrium constant for cytidylyltransferase was analyzed by measuring the proportion of substrate versus product via HPLC analysis, obtained from both the forward and reverse reactions. These data indicate a Keq of 0.27 with the reaction having a slight preference for CTP synthesis. There is some indication in the kinetic data that a second Mg2+ ion is required in addition to that forming the Mg2+-CTP complex. Thus a 2 mm excess of Mg2+ over Mg2+-CTP was needed for full activity although a 0.5 mm excess should have been sufficient to keep MgCTP in that form. The dissociation constant of the second metal ion is presumably less than 1 mm. Kinetic parameters for the back reaction (NTP synthesis) indicate that the enzyme has a clear preference for CDP-glucose over UDP-glucose as shown in Table IV. The Km for CDP-glucose is 11 ± 2 μm, whereas the Km for UDP-glucose is 2535 ± 240 μm. However, the Vmax for both substrates is nearly the same at ∼8 μm/min. The Km for pyrophosphate is 67 ± 8 μm.Table IVKinetic parameters of the reverse reaction (NTP synthesis) These parameters were calculated by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation.SubstrateKm (μm)Vmax (μm/min)CDP-glucose11 (±2)8.0 (±0.2)Pyrophosphate67 (±8)8.3 (±0.3)UDP-glucose2535 (±240)7.6 (±0.3) Open table in a new tab The dramatic difference in the Km for CDP-glucose versus UDP-glucose but a nearly identical Km for CTP and UTP may be explained if the binding of the triphosphate nucleotide is driven by the affinity of the enzyme for pyrophosphate. Indeed, the Km for pyrophosphate is less than the Km for CTP or UTP (158 and 149 μm, respectively). The relatively low affinity of the enzyme for UDP-glucose suggests that the rate of dissociation of the UDP-glucose product is likely not rate-limiting and thus explains the slightly elevated Vmax for the forward reaction with UTP versus CTP. The results from the back reaction are somewhat more difficult to explain. Additional x-ray crystallographic and kinetic data, including the determination of the Km for glucose 1-phosphate and pyrophosphate in the presence of UTP and UDP-glucose, respectively, will be required to fully explain the current observations. Electron density corresponding to the bound nucleotide, MgCTP, is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the cytosine ring is in the anti-conformation, whereas the ribose adopts the C2′-endo pucker. At this resolution it is not possible to completely define the coordination geometry about the Mg2+ ion. However, it is apparent from this structure that the Mg2+ ion sits within 2.5 and 3.1 Å of the α-phosphoryl oxygens (Fig. 4a). Additionally, the side chains of Asp131 and Asp236 lie within coordination distance of the magnesium (2.0 and 2.1 Å, respectively). There is a second peak of electron density positioned near the α,β-bridging oxygen (2.4 Å) and a γ-phosphoryl oxygen (2.8 Å) of the nucleotide. This has been tentatively modeled as a magnesium ion.Fig. 4Structure of the cytidylyltransferase with bound CTP. A close-up view of the active site, within ∼3.2 Å, is shown in a. The green spheres represent bound magnesium ions. The dashed green lines indicate possible ligand coordination to these cations. At a resolution of 2.5 Å it is not possible to completely define the coordination spheres of the magnesiums. Ordered water molecules are depicted as red spheres. Possible hydrogen bonds (within 3.2 Å) between CTP and the protein are indicated by the dashed lines. A superposition of the α-carbon traces for the models of the cytidylyltransferase with either bound CDP-glucose (yellow) or CTP (blue) is depicted in b. Note that the β-hairpin motif labeled β9, β10 in b forms part of the active site in a neighboring molecule in the hexamer. The manner in which the enzyme accommodates either CTP or the product, CDP-glucose, is depicted in c.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A close-up view of the active site with bound MgCTP is shown in Fig. 4a. The backbone amide nitrogen of Gly10, the carbonyl oxygen of Ser106, and the guanidinium group of Arg111 all lie within hydrogen bonding distance to the carbonyl oxygen, the amino group, and the ring nitrogen, respectively, of the cytosine base. The 2-hydroxyl group of the nucleotide ribose sits within ∼2.9 Å of the backbone amide nitrogen of Gly11 and a water molecule, whereas the 3-hydroxyl group lies within 2.9 and 2.7 Å of the backbone nitrogen of Gly130 and the carbonyl oxygen of Leu8, respectively. In the previously determined structure of the enzyme complexed with its product, CDP-glucose, the loop defined by Thr14 to Ile21 was disordered (13Koropatkin N.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44023-44029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Strikingly, in the presence of CTP, the loop becomes ordered and both Oγ of Thr14 and Nϵ of Arg15 participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with γ-phosphoryl oxygens (Fig. 4a). Note that the side chain of Lys25 projects toward the α-phosphoryl group of CTP with its ϵ-nitrogen sitting at 2.4 Å from a phosphoryl oxygen. Shown in Fig. 4b is a superposition of the subunits with either bound CDP-glucose or CTP. The polypeptide chains for these two models correspond with a root mean square deviation of 0.45 Å for 203 structurally equivalent α-carbons. The most dramatic structural changes that occur upon binding either CTP or CDP-glucose are limited primarily to the β-hairpin regions labeled β3, β4, and β9, β10 in Fig. 4b. All of the residues involved in anchoring CTP to the protein are contained within the same subunit of the hexamer. This is in marked contrast to that observed in the model of the enzyme with bound product, CDP-glucose, whereby part of the binding pocket is provided by a second subunit in the hexamer. Specifically, Glu178 and Lys179 from a neighboring molecule form electrostatic interactions with CDP-glucose (13Koropatkin N.M. Holden H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44023-44029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These residues are disordered in the absence of CDP-glucose (Fig. 4b). An overlay of the CTP and CDP-glucose ligands, when bound in the active site of the cytidylyltransferase, is given in Fig. 4c. As can be seen, the two ligands adopt similar positions with respect to their base and ribosyl moieties. Quite remarkable conformational differences, however, occur beginning at their α-phosphorus atoms. Specifically, the torsional angle defined by the bond between O-5 of the ribosyl group and the α-phosphorus atom differs by ∼115° in these two models. As a result the glucosyl group in CDP-glucose abuts the side chain of Tyr129, whereas the γ-phosphoryl group of CTP sits near Thr14 and Arg15 (Fig. 4c). These two structures further argue against a Bi Bi ping-pong mechanism in that the only potential base near the α-phosphorus is Lys25. Strikingly, the β-phosphorus of the CDP-glucose ligand is located at ∼3.4 Å from the α-phosphorus of CTP in the overlay presented in Fig. 4c. Assuming that the binding of the glucose moiety in CDP-glucose mimics what would occur for the substrate, glucose 1-phosphate, it is easy to envisage a catalytic mechanism for the cytidylyltransferase that proceeds via direct nucleophilic attack of the glucose 1-phosphate phosphoryl oxygen on the α-phosphorus of CTP. In conclusion, from both the structural and kinetic data presented here it can be concluded that the cytidylyltransferase reaction is sequential and similar to that reported for the glucose-1-phosphate thymidylyltransferases (11Zuccotti S.

https://openalex.org/W2075829955,"The Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases (SFKs) participates in a variety of signal transduction pathways, including promotion of cell growth, prevention of apoptosis, and regulation of cell interactions and motility. In particular, SFKs are required for the mitogenic response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). However, it is not clear whether there is a discrete SFK-specific pathway leading to enhanced gene expression or whether SFKs act to generally enhance PDGF-stimulated gene expression. To examine this, we treated quiescent NIH3T3 cells with PDGF in the presence or absence of small molecule inhibitors of SFKs, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and MEK1/2. Global patterns of gene expression were analyzed by using Affymetrix Gene-Chip arrays, and data were validated by using reverse transcription-PCR and ribonuclease protection assay. We identified a discrete set of immediate early genes induced by PDGF and inhibited in the presence of the SFK-selective inhibitor SU6656. A subset of these SFK-dependent genes was induced by PDGF even in the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 or the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. By using ribonuclease protection assays and nuclear run-off assays, we further determined that PDGF did not stimulate the rate of transcription of these SFK-dependent immediate early genes but rather promoted mRNA stabilization. Our data suggest that PDGF regulates gene expression through an SFK-specific pathway that is distinct from the Ras-MAPK and PI3K pathways, and that SFKs signal gene expression by enhancing mRNA stability.

The protein-tyrosine kinase Src was first described more than 20 years ago. It is the prototype for a group of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, the Src family. Some members of this family are restricted in their expression to hematopoietic cells, whereas others (Src, Fyn, and Yes) are more ubiquitously expressed. SFKs 1The abbreviations used are: SFKs, Src family kinases; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGF-R, PDGF receptor; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, MAPK kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; RPA, ribonuclease protection assay; RT, reverse transcription; UTR, untranslated region; CRD, CR instability determinant; AUREs, AU-rich elements; probe IDs, probe identification. help to transduce signals from a variety of cell surface receptors during proliferative and immune responses. They are also frequently activated as cells enter mitosis, rearrange their cytoskeleton, or become motile (1Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar, 3Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). Thus, they are involved in a diverse array of physiological processes. Much of the understanding of SFK function comes from analyses of fibroblasts in culture. These studies established that SFKs participate in the mitogenic response elicited by several peptide growth factors, including epidermal growth factor (EGF) and PDGF (4Bromann P.A. Korkaya H. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7957-7968Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). SFKs become activated when fibroblasts are stimulated with PDGF, whose receptor is itself a tyrosine kinase (5Ralston R. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7845-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and associate with the PDGF receptor (PDGF-R) (6Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). SFKs are required for PDGF to stimulate mitogenesis in NIH3T3 cells (8Twamley-Stein G.M. Pepperkok R. Ansorge W.

Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has recently focused on the growth factor-stimulated production of Myc, a transcription factor required for efficient cell cycle transit. Previous work demonstrated that the block to PDGF-stimulated DNA synthesis caused by dominant negative SFKs could be overcome by expression of Myc (10Barone M.V. Courtneidge S.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 509-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Another transcription factor, Fos, was unable to rescue this block. Furthermore, Myc could not overcome the block caused by dominant negative Ras. Together, these data suggested that PDGF stimulation results in the initiation of a discrete SFK signal transduction pathway, distinct from the classical Ras-MAPK pathway, which culminates in Myc production. The subsequent characterization and use of SU6656, an SFK inhibitor, confirmed that myc mRNA was in large part under SFK control (9Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). These studies have suggested that different PDGF effectors might each control a discrete subset of the response of the cell to PDGF. However, one study reported that activation of PDGF-R led to enhanced expression of a set of immediate early genes, and that PDGF-R mutants lacking binding sites for individual signaling effectors (including Ras-GAP or PI3K) failed to block expression of any of these genes (11Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). These data suggested a lack of specificity in PDGF-R signaling. We decided to address this issue by using a different approach: analyzing global patterns of gene expression in quiescent fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF in the presence or absence of various small molecule inhibitors. These studies are reported here. Cell Line and Reagents—NIH3T3 fibroblast cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mml-glutamine, 1.5 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Recombinant human PDGF-BB was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). SU6656 was obtained from SUGEN, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA), and U0126, PD98059, and LY294002 were purchased from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Radionuclides were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ), and all other molecular biology reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Murine Genome U74v2 set and Mouse Expression set 430 GeneChip arrays were purchased from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). PDGF Stimulation and RNA Isolation—NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 7 × 105 cells/10-cm plate and grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% O2 for 24 h. Cells were then quiesced for 40 h in starvation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2 mml-glutamine, 1.5 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and 1× insulin/transferrin/selenium (Invitrogen)). After 40 h, quiescent cells were placed in fresh starvation medium for an additional 30 min. Cells were then incubated with SU6656 (2 μm), U0126 (10 μm), LY294002 (7.5 μm), PD98059 (50 μm), or Me2SO vehicle for 1 h. Then, in the presence of inhibitors or vehicle, cells were stimulated for 1 h with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Total RNA was isolated using either Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) or RNeasy mini kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The quality of the total RNA was analyzed by measuring the A260/A280 ratio as well as the intensity of 18 S and 28 S rRNA on a 1% agarose gel. Affymetrix GeneChip Analysis—The Affymetrix protocol followed was essentially as described previously (12Miller J. Bromberg-White J.L. DuBois K. Eugster E. Srikanth S. Haddad R. DeLeeuw C. Webb C.P. Appl. Genomics Proteomics. 2003; 2: 253-265Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 pmol of a T7-(dT)24 primer was added to 10 μg of total RNA. The primer and RNA were denatured at 70 °C for 10 min and placed on ice, and cDNA was then synthesized by using SuperScript II RT (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reactions were terminated by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 30 mm, and samples were placed on ice. An equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) was added to each cDNA sample, transferred to Phase Lock gels (Eppendorf Scientific, Westbury, NY), and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 min. The aqueous upper layer was precipitated with 2.5 m ammonium acetate and 2.5× final volume 100% ethanol. Samples were centrifuged, and resulting pellets were washed extensively with 80% ethanol and resuspended in 12 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The in vitro transcription labeling reactions were done using the ENZO BioArray kit (Affymetrix) to synthesize amplified biotin-labeled cRNA targets. The labeled cRNA was cleaned using RNeasy mini kits, and 15 μg was hybridized to Murine Genome U74Av2 or Mouse Expression 430 GeneChip arrays at the Genomics Technology Support Facility at Michigan State University (East Lansing, MI) on a Gene-Chip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix). Probe intensity values were extracted from the array image using GCOS software (Affymetrix). All of the Affymetrix GeneChip array expression data have been deposited in the NCBI gene expression and hybridization array data repository (accession number GSE2196). Data Analysis—Affymetrix gene expression data were normalized to an average intensity of 500 across each array, and the normalized CHP files were entered into xenobase, a relational database with associated analysis software (www.vai.org/vari/xenobase/default.asp). Data from corresponding quiescent NIH3T3 samples were selected as reference to allow calculation of treated/quiescent gene expression ratios. Gene expression ratios were log2-transformed prior to analysis so that relative increases and decreases in gene expression were represented on a linear scale. For genes called absent in test and reference samples, no fold change in gene expression was calculated. For hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles, log2-transformed gene expression ratios were loaded into and viewed with xenobase, and average linkage clustering was carried out using correlation coefficients as described (13Eisen M.B. Spellman P.T. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14863-14868Crossref PubMed Scopus (13262) Google Scholar). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR—Unique oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed using Unigene sequence data from the NCBI database, and oligonucleotides were obtained from IDT DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Five μg of RNeasy mini kit-purified total RNA was reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II RT using oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two μl of cDNA per reaction were amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers as follows: 94 °C (2 min); 19–24 cycles of 94 °C (1 min), 55 °C (30 s), and 72 °C (1 min). PCRs were performed in duplicate or triplicate, and products were visualized by using 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Amplification of β-actin was used as an internal control. Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA)—Quiescent NIH3T3 cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml PDGF in the presence of small molecule inhibitors. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). For each reaction, 25 μg of total RNA was mixed with 32P-labeled riboprobes, which were transcribed from restriction-digested plasmid DNA using the MAXIScript T7 kit from Ambion, Inc. (Austin, TX). RPAs were performed using the RPA III kit from Ambion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protected fragments were resolved by PAGE using Criterion 5% TBE urea precast gels (Bio-Rad). After PAGE, gels were transferred to filter paper, vacuum-dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 1–6 h. Films were processed in a Kodak film developer and scanned into Adobe Photoshop 7.0 for digital imaging. Nuclear Run-off Assay—Quiescent NIH3T3 cells were stimulated with 25 ng/ml PDGF for 0–60 min. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 1000 rpm at 4 °C. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Nonidet P-40). After 5 min of incubation on ice, the cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization, and nuclei were isolated by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm at 4 °C. The nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold reaction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 140 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol) and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 2000 rpm at 4 °C. The nuclei were then resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold reaction buffer containing 5 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and 25 μCi of [α-32P]UTP. Following 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the nascent RNA was extracted using Trizol and hybridized to specific DNA probes blotted on Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Biosciences). To prepare DNA probes, 400–600-bp DNA fragments from mouse mcp-1, mcp-3, myc, adrenomedullin, fos, and β-actin were amplified by PCR using gene-specific primer pairs. Ten μg of PCR product were denatured by incubating in 100 mm NaOH at 100 °C for 10 min. Denatured DNA samples and nonspecific probes were applied to nitrocellulose membrane using Bio-Dot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then air-dried and UV cross-linked (1200 μJ) using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Immunoblotting—To detect ERK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2, NIH3T3 cells were treated as described above and suspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Protein bands were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 mouse monoclonal antibody (E-4), stripped, and reprobed using anti-ERK1/2 rabbit polyclonal antibody (C-16, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Sigma) and detected using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Patterns of Gene Expression in NIH3T3 Fibroblasts Are Experimentally Reproducible—To identify global patterns of PDGF-induced immediate early gene expression in NIH3T3 cells, quiescent cells were treated for 1 h with 25 ng/ml PDGF-BB or with vehicle. Two separate but identical experiments were performed, and the total RNA from each was hybridized to Affymetrix Murine Genome (MG) U74Av2 Gene-Chip arrays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because only low passage (less than 10 passages) NIH3T3 cells were used in these studies, and because identical conditions were used in each experiment, a high degree of data reproducibility between experiments was expected. To eliminate low intensity noise, we analyzed gene expression data from both experiments using the following filters: gene expression values were present in all samples, and sample intensity values were greater than 150 units and differed by more than 350 intensity units from quiescent NIH3T3 reference. For experiment 1, this filtering resulted in the identification of 538 sample probe IDs that differed from the reference. The log2-transformed gene expression ratios from experiment 1 were plotted against the log2-transformed gene expression ratios from experiment 2. The resulting correlation coefficient of 0.87 demonstrated a high level of experimental reproducibility between experiments (Fig. 1A). This set of probe IDs was further filtered to include only probe IDs that changed expression levels at least 2-fold in response to PDGF treatment. Again, the log2-transformed gene expression ratios from experiment 1 were plotted against the log2-transformed gene expression ratios from experiment 2. In this case, the correlation coefficient of 0.89 further demonstrated a low level of variability in gene expression data between experiments (Fig. 1B). PDGF Drives Pathway-specific Gene Expression—To determine the contribution of various signaling pathways to PDGF-induced immediate early gene expression, we analyzed global patterns of PDGF-induced gene expression in the presence of various small molecule inhibitors. Because we were most interested in the contribution of SFKs in PDGF-induced gene expression, we used the drug SU6656 to block SFK activity (9Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). To isolate the contribution of SFKs specifically, PDGF-induced gene expression was also analyzed in the presence of the MEK1/2 inhibitors U0126 or PD98059, or in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. The concentrations of inhibitors were selected based on the minimum concentrations of each drug required to completely block PDGF-induced bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). To demonstrate that inhibitor treatment alone has little effect on overall gene expression levels, quiescent NIH3T3 cells were treated for 1 h with 25 ng/ml PDGF or vehicle in the presence of 2 μm SU6656, 10 μm U0126, 7.5 μm LY294002, or vehicle. Total RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Expression (MOE) 430A GeneChip arrays as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We analyzed gene expression data by using the following filters: gene expression values were present in all samples; sample intensity values were greater than 50 units and differed by more than 100 intensity units from reference values, and sample values varied at least 3-fold with respect to quiescent NIH3T3 reference. This filtering resulted in the inclusion of 29 different probe IDs. Some genes were represented by multiple probe IDs (e.g. Tis 11b, Krupple-like factor 4, etc.), which provides additional confirmation of their expression patterns. These 29 probe IDs were subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering so that changes in gene expression across samples could be readily observed. The cluster diagram of these data, which were not mean-centered, indicates relative high and low expression for the given probe ID as shown in Fig. 2 by red and green boxes, respectively. These data demonstrate that each inhibitor alone has little effect on basal levels of gene expression and that PDGF treatment induces the expression of a set of genes, which are differentially affected by inhibitors. Note that whereas LY294002 alone appears to significantly alter expression of a few probe IDs in clustering raw data, in fact when clustering mean-centered data, these differences are less significant. SFK-dependent Genes—To identify a set of PDGF-induced immediate early genes that required SFK activity for expression, quiescent NIH3T3 cells were treated for 1 h with 25 ng/ml PDGF or vehicle in the presence of 2 μm SU6656 or vehicle. Global patterns of gene expression were analyzed using Affymetrix MG U74Av2 GeneChip arrays using the following filters: values were present in all samples; sample intensity values were equal to or greater than 50 units and differed by more than 100 units from reference, and sample values were increased at least 2-fold in response to PDGF. This filtering resulted in the inclusion of 127 probe IDs that were induced at least 2-fold by PDGF, and of these 36 were induced less than 1.5-fold in response to PDGF plus 2 μm SU6656 (Table I).Table IThe expression of a subset of PDGF-inducible genes is inhibited by the SFK-specific inhibitor SU6656UnigeneGene encodesLog2 gene expression ratio relative to quiescent fibroblastsPercent inhibitionPDGFPDGF + SU6656Mm.4679Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor140.021.884.4Mm.289824Interleukin 1 receptor-like 132.75.284.3M19681MCP-15.12.061.4Mm.328358cDNA clone UI-M-BH1-alc-a-02-0-UI 5′4.31.956.5U20735JunB3.31.553.9Mm.259672Adult male aorta and vein cDNA, RIKEN full-length enriched library, clone: A530041M223.01.452.8L00039Myc14.36.852.3Mm.290207E26 avian leukemia oncogene 2, 3′-domain3.71.851.9Mm.1408Adrenomedullin21.810.651.6Mm.86541CCR-416.17.851.2D16497Natriuretic peptide precursor type B14.07.248.9Mm.795Colony-stimulating factor 1 (macrophage)2.51.348.4Mm.3468Suppressor of cytokine signaling 33.01.647.8U89411Nuclear factor, interleukin 3, regulated17.59.347.0Mm.24402Glutamine fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 223.712.746.6Mm.18571Tis 11b5.12.845.0U83148Nuclear factor, interleukin 3, regulated2.01.144.3Mm.8042Inhibin β-A4.02.342.4Mm.3117Pleckstrin homology-like domain, family A, member 14.72.841.7Mm.282184Vascular endothelial growth factor A5.43.141.6Mm.25613Immediate early response 33.32.040.6U86783Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 246.527.940.1Mm.280895Uridine monophosphate kinase2.31.439.7Mm.2614711 days embryo head cDNA, RIKEN full-length Enriched library, clone: 6230421P05 product: unknown EST, full insert sequence2.61.637.5K02236Metallothionein 239.925.236.7U20735JunB3.42.236.2AV374868Suppressor of cytokine signaling 32.11.336.1M28845Egr-12.51.635.8Mm.292547Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 24.02.635.3Mm.249333RIKEN cDNA 1300002F13 gene4.73.134.8Mm.110220DNA-damage inducible transcript 39.56.234.8U86783Nuclear receptor subfamily 4, group A, member 22.31.534.6Mm.2706Activating transcription factor 32.11.434.2Mm.289824Interleukin 1 receptor-like 111.67.734.0X70058MCP-32.51.633.7V00835Metallothionein 13.02.033.6 Open table in a new tab We performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR as well as RPA analysis to validate these gene expression data. By using equivalent amounts of cDNA for each reaction, gene-specific primer pairs were used to amplify small segments of the genes of interest by PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Six genes were selected for RT-PCR analysis because the array analysis suggested their expression was induced by PDGF and inhibited by SU6656 (Table I). Reactions were performed in triplicate, and β-actin was used as a control for relative amounts of template. These data demonstrate that expression of mcp-1, myc, adrenomedullin, ccr-4, tis 11b, and mcp-3 genes were enhanced in response to PDGF treatment and that in each case 2 μm SU6656 inhibited the PDGF-induced increase in gene expression (Fig. 3A). We then selected three of these six genes and analyzed expression levels further by using quantitative RPA. These data confirm that mRNA expression levels of MCP-1, MCP-3, and adrenomedullin were significantly increased in response to PDGF and were potently inhibited by SU6656 (Fig. 3B). The apparent small PDGF-induced increase in the expression of β-actin is likely because of the simultaneous use of four different riboprobes in this experiment, and we generally do not see very significant increases in β-actin expression in response to PDGF treatment (see Fig. 5B). These data confirm the gene expression data shown in Table I and validate the identity of a set of genes induced by PDGF through SFK activity.Fig. 5RT-PCR and RPA analysis of SFK-dependent and MEK-dependent genes. Quiescent NIH3T3 cells were treated for 1 h with 25 ng/ml PDGF or vehicle in the presence of 2 μm SU6656, 10 μm U0126, 7.5 μm LY294002, or vehicle. A, by using equivalent amounts of cDNA for each reaction, gene-specific primer pairs were used to amplify small segments of genes by PCR.

Reactions were performed in duplicate, and β-actin was used as a control for relative amounts of total RNA. The data presented are derived from two separate assays, each of which had internal positive and negative controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We identified a set of PDGF-inducible genes that signal through SFKs. However, SFKs are known to also participate in signaling through other pathways, notably the Ras-MAPK pathways and the PI3K pathways (2Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). To determine which genes were specifically dependent on SFK activity for increased expression in response to PDGF, quiescent NIH3T3 cells were treated with 25 ng/ml PDGF or vehicle for 1 h in the presence of 2 μm SU6656, 10 μm U0126, 7.5 μm LY294002, or vehicle. For these analyses, gene expression was evaluated by using a newer version of the Affymetrix GeneChip arrays (MOE 430A) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Expression data were analyzed using the following filters: values were present in all samples; sample intensity values were greater than 50 units and differed by more than 100 intensity units from reference; sample values genes were increased at least 2-fold in response to PDGF treatment, and genes were inhibited at least 50% by one of the three inhibitors. This filtering resulted in the inclusion of 174 probe IDs that were induced at least 2-fold by PDGF, and of these 6 were only inhibited at least 50% by 2 μm SU6656, 11 were only inhibited at least 50% by 10 μm U0126, and 2 were only inhibited at least 50% by 7.5 μm LY294002 (Table II). All of the 23 probe IDs that passed the above filtering criteria were subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering so that changes in gene expression across samples could be readily observed. The cluster diagram of these mean-centered data indicates relative high and low expression for the given probe ID as shown in Fig. 4 by red and green boxes, respectively. These data demonstrate that each inhibitor alone has little effect on basal levels of gene expression and that PDGF treatment induces the expression of a set of genes, which are differentially affected by inhibitors.Table IIThe expression of discrete sets of PDGF-responsive genes is specifically inhibited by the SFK inhibitor SU6656, by the MEK inhibitor U0126, and by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002UnigeneGene encodesLog2 gene expression ratio relative to quiescent fibroblastsPDGFPDGF + SU6656PDGF + U0126PDGF + LY294002SFK-dependentMm.290320MCP-128.48.921.140.0Mm.246513Fos12.34.417.013.1Mm.86541CCR-425.810.218.322.0Mm.1408Adrenomedullin2.71.23.23.8Mm.795Colony-stimulating factor 1 (macrophage)3.41.62.23.1Mm.259672Adult male aorta and vein cDNA, RIKEN full-length enriched library, clone: A530041M223.51.73.35.5MEK-dependentMm.282092Hsp409.26.82.08.8Mm.282092Hsp406.14.31.66.1Mm.248335FosB16.116.74.713.7Mm.249333RIKEN cDNA 1300002F13 gene24.913.47.423.7Mm.6215Fra-118.014.15.615.8Mm.249333RIKEN cDNA 1300002F13 gene36.520.914.438.9Mm.4791Epiregulin13.511.05.416.6Mm.289681Diphtheria toxin receptor12.47.35.115.7Mm.6215Fra-111.79.15.010.1Mm.290421Egr-213.39.85.711.3Mm.28405Serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase8.14.93.87.7PI3K-dependentMm.273188Coagulation factor III3.22.63.61.5AV260654AV2606542.32.32.61.1 Open table in a new tab We used semi-quantitative RT-PCR and RPA to validate these gene expression data as described above.

In addition, the affected individuals exhibit latently expressed (i.e., postpubertal) above normal activity levels of hepatic multicytochrome P450-dependent drug metabolizing enzymes. We report that in spite of apparent normal health for the better part of their lives, daily administration of therapeutic-like doses of phenobarbital to male and female rat pups during the first postpartum week reduced life expectancy by approximately 20%. Necropsy at the time of natural death revealed an associated two- to threefold increase in the incidence of tumors in barbiturate-exposed rats of both sexes and a three- to fourfold increase in urinary tract pathologies in male rats. At 2 yr of age, in agreement with an overexpression of hepatic CYP2C6 and CYP2C7, both in vitro and in vivo drug metabolism was more rapid in the phenobarbital-imprinted male and female animals. Moreover, when the senescent rats were rechallenged with a nominal dose of the barbiturate, males and females neonatally exposed to phenobarbital exhibited a dramatic overinduction of multicytochrome P450-dependent drug metabolizing enzymes as well as an overexpression of individual isoforms of cytochrome P450 implicated in enhanced susceptibility to tumorigenesis. Our findings support the growing realization that many adult diseases have their origins in early life by emphasizing that unlike adults, the new born is ""plastic,"" and even therapeutic drugs may produce ""silent"" programming defects that subtly, but irrevocably, jeopardize life-long well-being."
https://openalex.org/W1994547477,"Cisplatin is a platinum-containing chemotherapeutic drug that has been widely used to treat various human cancers. It acts by forming inter- and intracross-links of DNA, which is believed to be a major cause for its therapeutic efficacy. However, little attention has been paid to the effect of cisplatin on death ligand-induced cell death. Here we demonstrate that cisplatin inhibits death ligand-induced cell death in cell lines in a p53-independent manner. This inhibitory effect of cisplatin on cell death is direct, whereby cisplatin forms a complex with caspases leading to their inactivation. The cisplatin-caspase complex is reversed by the addition of reducing agent dithiothreitol, and caspase activity is regained. In addition, cisplatin shows a death-inhibition effect in in vivo animal models of fulminant liver damage induced by Fas activation and lipopolysaccharide-induced liver shock mediated by tumor necrosis factor-α. Together, we demonstrate that cisplatin inhibits cell death induced by death ligands in cell lines and in mice through caspase inactivation.

Cell death induced by death ligands, such as TNF-α, 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; DTT, dithiothreitol; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; pNA, p-nitroanilide; d-gal, d-galactosamine. TRAIL, and FasL, has been shown to play a pivotal role in maintaining a homeostasis like the immune response (1Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 2Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). However, death ligands have been shown to participate in many pathological processes. For instance, FasL, TNF-α, or TRAIL contributes to acute hepatic failure such that blocking of these death ligands ameliorates the hepatic cell death in various experimental animal models (3Zheng S.J. Wang P. Tsabary G. Chen Y.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 113: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 4Schmaltz C. Alpdogan O. Kappel B.J. Muriglan S.J. Rotolo J.A. Ongchin J. Willis L.M.

Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Upon engagement of death receptors by death ligands, the death signaling pathway is initiated by formation of death-inducing signaling complex at the trimerized cytoplasmic domain of death receptors (Apo-1/Fas, DR4, or DR5) (1Wang S. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8628-8633Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 2Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The activation of procaspase-8 at the death-inducing signaling complex stimulates the downstream signaling cascades transmitted through two major pathways, mitochondria-dependent and -independent pathways. In the mitochondria-independent pathway, caspase-8 directly activates procaspase-3 to active caspase-3, which cleaves target substrates and eventually leads to cell death. In the mitochondria-dependent pathway, caspase-8 cleaves Bid into tBid, which translocates to the mitochondria and causes mitochondrial damage culminating in an efflux of death-promoting proteins such as cytochrome c. This in turn leads to activation of caspase-9 and then caspase-3 (6Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar). Despite the existence of these two pathways, the mitochondria-dependent pathway is thought to be critical in hepatic cell death, because effective death induction of hepatocytes does not occur unless the mitochondria-dependent signaling pathway is actively engaged (8Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Cisplatin was first identified as a growth suppressant of bacterial cells and later found to have a tumor-killing activity in mice, leading to its use as an anti-cancer agent in humans. It has been widely prescribed to treat the various human tumors including germ-cell tumors, advanced bladder carcinoma, breast cancer, and lung carcinoma. Cisplatin is believed to cause cross-linking in intra- and interstrands of DNA, eventually leading to cell death mediated through the activation of caspases (9Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 10Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated that chemotherapeutic agents including cisplatin significantly increase the death-inducing activity of death ligands. Even at a subtherapeutic doses, which show no induction of cell death, chemotherapeutic agents are able to promote death ligand-induced killing (11Arizono Y. Yoshikawa H. Naganuma H. Hamada Y. Nakajima Y. Tasaka K. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Munshi A. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 50: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Here, using in vitro and in vivo models, we show that cisplatin has the opposite effect. Rather than promoting death ligand-mediated cell killing, cisplatin inhibits cell death induced by death ligands, and this effect is achieved through direct association of cisplatin with caspases. Cell Culture and Measurement of Cell Viability—HeLa, PC-3, and HCT116 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were plated on 48-well plates for cell death assay. Cell viability was determined by crystal violet staining as described previously (23Kim Y.M. Kim T.H. Seol D.W. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31437-31441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were stained with 0.4% crystal violet in methanol for 10 min at room temperature and then washed with tap water. Stained cells were extracted with 4% methanol, and dye extracts were measured at a 540 nm wavelength using a micro-plate reader. Western Blotting—Cell lysates or recombinant proteins were separated by a 15% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were hybridized with anticaspase-8 antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), anti-Bid antibody (a generous gift from Dr. Xiao-Ming Yin at the University of Pittsburgh), or anti-caspase-3 antibody (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA). Analysis of Bid Cleavage—Active recombinant caspase-8 protein (100 ng) was pretreated with cisplatin, etoposide, z-VAD-fmk, or cisplatin plus DTT in the reaction buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS), and then recombinant Bid protein (100 ng) or cytosolic lysate (200 μg) prepared from mouse liver was added to the reaction mixtures. The cleavage of Bid was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Bid antibody. In Vitro Analysis of Caspase Activities—Caspase-8 (Calbiochem) and caspase-3 assay kits (R&D System) were purchased, and the assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ac-IETD-pNA and Ac-DETD-pNA were used as the substrates for caspase-8 and caspase-3, respectively. Recombinant caspase-8 or caspase-3 protein was preincubated with cisplatin, etoposide, z-VAD-fmk, or cisplatin plus DTT for 10 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of substrates and then further incubated for1hat37 °C upon the addition of substrates. Caspase activities were measured at a 405 nm wavelength using a micro-plate reader. Binding of Cisplatin to Caspases—Active recombinant caspase-8 (50 ng) or caspase-3 protein (50 ng) was pretreated with cisplatin (25 μg) or etoposide (25 μg) in 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline buffer and then further incubated on ice for 1 h. Reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and caspase-3 and -8 were visualized by Western blotting with anti-caspase-3 antibody or anti-caspase-8 antibody. Animal Models—All animal studies followed the institutional guidelines. Adult BALB/c mice were purchased from Damool science (Daejeon, Korea) and injected intravenously with 1.5 μg of LPS/mouse (Sigma) and 20 mg of d-galactosamine (d-gal)/mouse (Sigma) or with 7.5 μg of Jo-2 antibody/mouse (Pharmingen). Cisplatin (0.6 mg/mouse) was injected intravenously 2 h before LPS/d-gal injection. After treatment, the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The photographs of the gross liver were taken with an Olympus digital camera, and the liver tissues were collected and processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining. Protective Effect of Cisplatin on Death Ligand-induced Cell Death in Cell Lines—Chemotherapeutic agents substantially increase cell death induced by TRAIL, FasL, or TNF-α and even induce cell death in cells resistant to the individual agent alone (12Munshi A. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 50: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Jazirehi A.R. Ng C.P. Gan X.H. Schiller G. Bonavida B. Clin.

Thus, we first evaluated the death-enhancing activity of various chemotherapeutic agents on TRAIL-induced cell death. HeLa cells were treated with TRAIL for 6 h in the presence of cisplatin or etoposide and analyzed for cell death. Cisplatin or etoposide alone did not show any significant cell death-inducing activity at 6 h of treatment, whereas TRAIL effectively induced cell death in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A). When co-treated with TRAIL, etoposide increased TRAIL-induced cell death as previously observed (Fig. 1A). Similarly, other chemotherapeutic agents, such as actinomycin D, doxorubicin, cycloheximide, and MG132, also promoted TRAIL-induced cell death (data not shown). However, cisplatin inhibited TRAIL-induced cell death in HeLa cells. Moreover, cisplatin attenuated the death-enhancing activity of etoposide in TRAIL-induced cell death (Fig. 1, C-E), indicating that the death-inhibitory activity of cisplatin is dominant over the death-enhancing activity of etoposide. These findings prompted us to investigate the detailed mechanism of the death-inhibitory activity of cisplatin. First of all, we asked the question whether the death-inhibitory activity of cisplatin is only for TRAIL or whether it extends to other death ligands. To answer the question, we examined the effects of cisplatin and etoposide on FasL-induced cell death in HeLa cells. Similar to the results observed with TRAIL, cisplatin prevents agonistic anti-Fas (CH11)-induced cell death in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). Our data showed that cisplatin effectively inhibits the cell death-inducing activity of both TRAIL and FasL, indicating that cisplatin may block a common signaling pathway activated by TRAIL and FasL. The death-induction activity of cisplatin has been thought to be mainly because of the formation of intra- and interstrand DNA cross-links, which leads to the stabilization of the p53 tumor suppressor protein and subsequently the induction of either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (16Caelles C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Nature. 1994; 370: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 17Gong J.G. Costanzo A. Yang H.Q. Melino G. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Levrero M. Wang J.Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether or not the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on TRAILinduced cell death is associated with p53 function. We first utilized a PC-3 prostate tumor cell line that has a p53-null mutation and is susceptible to TRAIL-induced cell death. As shown in Fig. 1C, cisplatin inhibited TRAIL-induced cell death and the death-enhancing activity of etoposide in PC-3 cells, as observed in HeLa cells. This indicates that p53 is not associated with the death-inhibitory activity of cisplatin. To further confirm that p53 is not associated with the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on TRAIL-induced cell death, we next utilized a human colon cancer HCT116 p53-deficient cell line in which the p53 gene was specifically deleted by homologous recombination. HCT116 p53+/+ or HCT116 p53-/- cells were treated with cisplatin or etoposide in the presence or absence of TRAIL and analyzed for cell death. As shown in Fig. 2, D and E, cisplatin inhibited TRAIL-induced cell death regardless of p53 status, whereas etoposide did not show any inhibitory effect. Our data confirm that the death inhibition of cisplatin does not depend on the p53 status. Cisplatin Inhibition of Caspase Activation and Bid Cleavage—Caspase activation is a key mechanism for the induction of cell death by various death stimuli, including death ligands and chemotherapeutic agents. Studies have shown that upon engagement of TRAIL and FasL, caspase-8 activation is required for their induction of cell death, because caspase-8-deficient cells are resistant to these death ligands (18Seol D.W. Li J. Seol M.H. Park S.Y. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1138-1143PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to elucidate the mechanism of the death-inhibitory activity of cisplatin, we investigated the upstream and downstream components of the mitochondrial-dependent death pathway comprising caspase-8 activation, Bid cleavage, and caspase-3 activation. HeLa cells were pretreated with cisplatin or etoposide for 15-120 min and incubated for 2 more hours following TRAIL addition. Cisplatin clearly inhibited TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage in a time-dependent manner; however, etoposide enhanced TRAIL-induced caspase-8 activation (Fig. 2A). These results agree with our observation of the death-inhibitory effect of cisplatin and the death-enhancing effect of etoposide on TRAIL addition. Because caspase-8 has been known to activate caspase-3 both directly and indirectly, we examined whether TRAIL-induced caspase-3 activation was inhibited by cisplatin. Caspase-3 activation was inhibited by cisplatin but not by etoposide in a similar fashion as caspase-8 activation (Fig. 2A). Caspase-8-cleaved Bid is known as a key factor for the initiation of the mitochondria-dependent death signal pathway, leading to the release of mitochondrial death factors from the mitochondria to the cytosol (7Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 19Kim T.H. Zhao Y. Barber M.J. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol.

Because we observed the cisplatin inhibition of caspase-8 activation and Bid cleavage, we next examined whether cisplatin inhibits the release of cytochrome c in response to TRAIL. HeLa cells were pretreated with cisplatin or etoposide for 1-2 h and treated with TRAIL. Then, we detected the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. The amount of the released cytochrome c was decreased by cisplatin but not etoposide treatment in agreement with the attenuated caspase-8 activation and the decreased Bid cleavage seen with cisplatin (Fig. 2B). Our data strongly suggest that cisplatin inhibits TRAIL-induced cell death by suppressing the activation and/or activity of caspases including caspase-3 and -8, the inhibition of which abrogates both the mitochondria-dependent and the mitochondria-independent signal pathways. Cisplatin Inactivates Caspases—Although it has been well recognized that cisplatin forms DNA adducts, several studies have reported that cisplatin is also able to form a complex with proteins, as observed in high mobility group box protein 1, albumin, TATA box-binding protein, and histone H1 (9Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 20Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 23-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 21Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that cisplatin has been shown to interact with the sulfur group of the cysteine residue, forming a cisplatin-protein complex (22Ivanov A.I. Christodoulou J. Parkinson J.A. Barnham K.J. Tucker A. Woodrow J. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14721-14730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Notably, caspases are cysteine proteases with a cysteine residue at the active site, and modification or change of the cysteine residue to another amino acid abrogates their activities. Thus, we examined whether cisplatin directly inactivates caspases by interacting with the sulfur group of their cysteine residues. Active recombinant caspase-8 was preincubated with cisplatin, etoposide, or a pan caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk in the presence or absence of a reducing agent, DTT, and then recombinant full-length Bid protein or cytosolic lysates from mouse liver were added. Bid cleavage was analyzed by Western blotting. Bid cleavage by caspase-8 was inhibited by cisplatin and z-VAD-fmk but not by etoposide (Fig. 2, C and D). DTT eliminated the inhibitory effect of cisplatin on the Bid cleavage activity of caspase-8 (Fig. 2D). Our data indicate that cisplatin directly inactivates caspase-8, which is reversed by DTT. To further confirm that caspases are inactivated by cisplatin, active recombinant caspases were preincubated with cisplatin, etoposide, or their inhibitors, and their activities were subsequently measured using specific colorimetric substrates. As shown in Fig. 2E, cisplatin inhibited the activity of caspase-8, and this inhibitory effect of cisplatin was eliminated by the addition of DTT. Cisplatin also inhibited the activity of caspase-3 in a way similar to that of caspase-8 (Fig. 2F). Cisplatin Directly Binds to Caspases, Leading to Caspase Inactivation—Nitric oxide has been shown to effectively inhibit the cell death of hepatocytes by inactivating caspases via formation of S-nitrosylation with caspases at the cysteine residue of their active sites, and a reducing agent, DTT, reverses caspase inhibition activities by eliminating S-nitrosylation from caspases (23Kim Y.M.

Yin X.M. Billiar T.R. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 770-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Moreover, cisplatin is known to form a cisplatin-protein complex with several proteins by binding to the sulfur group of cysteine residues as mentioned (22Ivanov A.I. Christodoulou J. Parkinson J.A. Barnham K.J. Tucker A. Woodrow J. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14721-14730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Together, the evidence suggests that cisplatin may inactivate caspases by binding to the sulfur group of their cysteine residues. To examine this possibility, active recombinant caspase-3 or -8 was incubated with cisplatin or etoposide and analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the presence or absence of the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol. Cisplatin, but not etoposide, treatment caused mobility shifts of caspase-3 and -8 in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. These cisplatin-induced mobility shifts were eliminated by the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3, A and B). Our data indicate that cisplatin inactivates caspases by directly forming a cisplatin-caspase complex at the sulfur group of cysteine residues of caspases. Inhibition of TNF-α-mediated Hepatic Cell Death in Mice— To examine whether cisplatin inhibits cell death induced by death ligands in animal models, we adopted the model of TNF-α-mediated cell death of hepatocytes in mice induced by LPS and d-galactosamine (LPS/d-gal) (25Zhao Y. Li S. Childs E.E. Kuharsky D.K. Yin X.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27432-27440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26Yin X.M. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). BALB/c mice injected with 1.5 μg of LPS/mouse and 20 mg of d-galactosamine/mouse, which causes death of hepatic cells within 20-24 h. Massive liver damage was observed grossly (Fig. 4C) and histologically (Fig. 4F). Pretreatment of 0.6 mg of cisplatin/mouse at 2 h before injection of LPS/d-gal tremendously reduced hepatic cell death in the liver as judged by the gross appearance of the liver (Fig. 4D) and hemotoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 4F). Caspase-8 activity was significantly decreased (Fig. 4E) and procaspase-3 and -8 were found to be cleaved to a lesser degree (Fig. 4G) as compared with that observed in mice without cisplatin treatment. An intravenous injection of LPS/d-gal into mice caused 80% mortality; however, cisplatin significantly reduced the mortality to ∼25% (Fig. 4H). Together, these data indicate that the reduction of mouse mortality was attributable to a reduction in liver damage due to the caspase inactivation by cisplatin. Inhibition of FasL-induced Fulminant Liver Damage in Mice—To further confirm that cisplatin inhibits death ligand-induced cell death in mice, we utilized another animal model of FasL-induced fulminant liver damage in mice. FasL has been shown to induce fulminant liver damage in mice through a massive cell death of hepatocytes (5Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 8Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J.

BALB/c mice were intravenously injected with Jo-2 antibody, an agonistic antibody to mouse Fas. Mice injected with 7.5 μg of Jo-2 antibody /mouse were dead of fulminant liver failure within 6-7 h. The liver damage was readily observed grossly (Fig. 5C) and microscopically by H/E staining (Fig. 5G). Caspase-8 activation measured by a colorimetric assay (Fig. 5E) and cleavage of procaspase-8 and -3 (Fig. 5F) were evident. Consistent with the LPS/d-gal-injected mice, mice pretreated with cisplatin 2 h before Jo-2 injection were evidently protected from the liver damage as judged by the reduction in liver damage seen grossly (Fig. 5D) and at the histological level (Fig. 5G) by H/E staining of liver. Caspase-8 activity (Fig. 5E) and the production of cleaved caspase-8 and -3 were substantially reduced (Fig. 5F) as well. These data indicate that cisplatin inhibits FasL-induced hepatic cell death in mice mediated through caspase inactivation. Cisplatin is one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents for treatment of cancer patients because of its potent death-inducing activity against various human cancers derived from testicular, ovarian, lung, and head and neck cancer. A number of studies have demonstrated that the tumor suppressing activity of cisplatin mainly depends upon DNA damage, leading to apoptotic cell death through p53 stabilization (9Siddik Z.H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7265-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 10Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 435-439Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 21Kartalou M. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 2001; 478: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, here we demonstrated that cisplatin inhibits death ligand (TRAIL, FasL, or TNF-α)-induced cell death in cancer cells irrespective of p53 status (Fig. 2) and death ligand-induced hepatic injury in mice (Figs. 4 and 5). Our studies revealed that the mechanism by which cisplatin inhibits death ligand-induced cell death is through direct association of cisplatin with caspases. This association most likely occurs between the cysteine residues in caspases and cisplatin leading to abrogation of caspase activity (Figs. 2 and 3). Many studies, however, have demonstrated that cisplatin promotes cell death in various tumor cells (11Arizono Y. Yoshikawa H. Naganuma H. Hamada Y. Nakajima Y. Tasaka K. Br. J. Cancer. 2003; 88: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Munshi A. McDonnell T.J. Meyn R.E. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 2002; 50: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14Evdokiou A. Bouralexis S. Atkins G.J. Chai F. Hay S. Clayer M. Findlay D.M. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 99: 491-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). This discrepancy between the previous reports and our data on the action of cisplatin leads us to speculate that two possible mechanisms for the action of cisplatin exist, which depend on the duration of treatment. The immediate early response appears to be associated with inactivation of pre-existing caspases resulting from the prompt binding of cisplatin to caspases. This inactivation of the pre-existing caspases by cisplatin is likely to be a major determinant for inhibiting death ligand-induced cell death. On the other hand, the late responses possibly initiated by cisplatin-DNA adducts are believed to involve several cellular processes like gene expression or repression, modulation of protein activity, and/or other unknown events, which require more than 48 h to be observed, which is the time cisplatin alone can induce cell death in HeLa cells. These cellular processes finally activate caspases, which may be newly synthesized, to induce cell death. This process of caspase activation appears to be a secondary event rather than a direct interaction of cisplatin with caspases. Thus, the caspase activation by cisplatin observed in majority of previous studies results from the secondary cellular processes. In this study, in contrast, we have utilized both cisplatin and death ligands such that we had a chance to observe the direct interaction between cisplatin and caspase activation caused by death ligands. This is possible mainly because of the different activation time points of caspases induced by cisplatin and TRAIL in that caspase activation by TRAIL occurs within 2-4 h in HeLa cells, the time when cisplatin alone cannot activate the caspases, whereas caspase activation by cisplatin takes 24-48 h. Thus, we are able to distinguish the caspase activation by death ligands or cisplatin alone. This allows us to see the new aspect of cisplatin that is inactivation of caspases. Together, we suggest that cisplatin has the dual function of caspase inactivation through direct association at the early responses and caspase activation through cellular processes at the late responses.

These proteins reveal a strikingly similar coordination arrangement of their diiron centers, but fulfill entirely different biological functions; in MMOH, the diiron center is located directly at the substrate binding catalytic site and is directly responsible for the hydroxylation of methane or other substrates, whereas in R2, the diiron center is more than 35 Å away from the substrate binding active site located in the second protein subunit R1 (9Sjöberg B.-M.

The catalytic role of the diiron center in R2 is to generate and stabilize a tyrosyl radical (at position Tyr122 in Escherichia coli R2), and this tyrosyl radical is connected to the active site in R1 via a chain of H-bonded amino acid residues. It has been proposed that upon substrate binding in R1 Tyr122 transfers its radical character via this chain to a cysteine (Cys439 in E. coli R1), which in turn starts substrate turnover from ribonucleotide to deoxyribonucleotide (9Sjöberg B.-M.

The R2 protein is a homodimer which in its active form contains two μ-oxo bridged diferric iron centers and a substoichiometric amount of a tyrosyl radical. The active form can be generated in vitro by the so-called reconstitution reaction by adding a 6-fold molar excess of Fe2+ and molecular oxygen to the iron-free apoR2 protein (13Atkin C.L. Thelander L. Reichard P. Lang G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosyl radical is stabilized by a surrounding cluster of hydrophobic side chains as well as by the diiron center, and survives for a couple of days at room temperature. During the reconstitution reaction, several intermediate states of the diiron center have been proposed (7Eklund H. Uhlin U. Färnegårdh M. Logan D. Nordlund P. Prog. Biophys. Mol.

To investigate the redox chemistry of R2 and the functional abilities of diiron centers in general, it is of great interest to modify the proteins by site-directed mutagenesis and to trap and characterize paramagnetic intermediates during the reconstitution reaction of the apoprotein with ferrous iron and molecular oxygen. The substitution of the radical site at Tyr122 in E. coli R2 with other amino acids has been performed for several reasons: (i) A protein-linked radical generated on another aromatic amino acid, e.g. tryptophan, is expected to be similarly well shielded and stabilized by the hydrophobic environment as is the tyrosyl radical. Such radicals and their interactions with the protein may be studied as models for functional amino acid radicals in other enzymes, where radicals might be more difficult to detect. (ii) A radical from another amino acid residue at this site may or may not assume the function of Tyr122 as a temporary electron and proton acceptor for the active site in the R1 protein in the catalytic cycle. (iii) By altering the normal target for oxidation by the diiron center, the latter may perform a different chemistry, which could help in understanding the different reactions of other structurally related diiron proteins, such as MMO. Results for several Tyr122 mutations have been reported previously. In R2-Y122F the precursor intermediate X was observed to have an increased lifetime compared with the wild type, and it was succeeded by transient tryptophan radicals at Trp111 and Trp107 near the iron site, which have been analyzed by EPR and ENDOR spectroscopy (18Sahlin M.

The mutant R2-Y122H of E. coli RNR described in this work was made in an attempt to generate a histidine radical at the shielded position 122. Histidine residues in proteins play important roles in coordination of metal ions and may also mediate electron and proton transfer. So far there is no evidence for the involvement of histidine radicals in the catalytic reaction of a protein. However, transient histidine radicals have been generated in Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase during a reaction with hydroperoxide and were indirectly detected by EPR using the spin trap technique (23Gunther M.R.

The crystal structure shows the majority (∼95%) of the protein, and information on the structure of the paramagnetic minority species H can be obtained only from spectroscopy. Detailed EPR and ENDOR studies of R2-Y122H with specific isotope labels on the ligands of the diferric cluster indicate that the stable paramagnetic center H in R2-Y122H is a diferric iron center strongly coupled to a phenoxyl radical derived from the phenylalanine Phe208. This finding is supported by comparison of MALDI-TOF mass spectra of trypsin-digested R2-Y122H and wild-type R2. Materials—57Fe (95.2%) foil was purchased from Chemotrade, Düsseldorf, Germany; D2O (99.97%), [γ-13C]Asp, [δ-13C]Glu, and D8-Phe were purchased from Isotec (Sigma-Aldrich). Sinapinic acid, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, urea, hydroxyurea, dithionite, phenazine methosulfate, 8-hydroxyquinoline-5-sulfonate, bathophenanthroline sulfonate, trisodium ascorbate, kanamycin, and carbenicillin were purchased from Sigma. Diammoniumiron(II)sulfate hexahydrate, hydrogen peroxide, acetonitrile, imidazole, lithium hydroxide, trifluoroacetic acid, and acetic acid from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. Trypsin Gold (Mass Spectrometry Grade) was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), dithiothreitol from Biomol, Hamburg, Germany, and iodoacetamide from Bio-Rad. The oligonucleotide used for generating the R2 mutant Y122H d(5′-TTCATTCTAGATCCCATACTCATATC-3′) was synthesized and purified by Scandinavian Gene Synthesis AB, Köping, Sweden. A restriction cleavage site for XbaI (TCTAGA), which does not alter the resulting amino acid sequence was also included in the primer. The histidine codon is indicated by bold face letters and the underlining denotes the changed nucleotides. Oligonucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis of pTB2 was performed with the uracil-DNA method described by Kunkel (25Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar) using the Muta-Gene in vitro mutagenesis kit purchased from Bio-Rad. The new construction, plasmid pTB2-Y122H, was verified with dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli MV 1190 [Δ(lac-proAB), thi, supE, Δ(srl-recA)306::Tn10/F′traD36, proAB, lacIZΔM15)] obtained from Bio-Rad was used for mutagenesis, cloning, and plasmid preparation. E. coli MC1009 [Δ(lacIPOZYA)X74, galE, galK, strA, Δ(araleu)7697, araD139, recA, srl::Tn10] obtained from Amersham Biosciences was used for expression. Plasmid pTB2 containing the nrdB gene coding for protein R2 was used in combination with a second plasmid, pGP1–2, for overexpression of R2-Y122H using heat induction of the T7 RNA polymerase (26Climent I. Sjöberg B.-M. Huang C.Y. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4801-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification—The cells carrying the R2-Y122H mutation were grown either in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, or in minimal medium (27Åberg A. Ormö M. Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9845-9850Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Both media contained carbenicillin 50 mg/ml and kanamycin 50 mg/ml. R2-Y122H was purified using the standard methods as described previously (28Sjöberg B.M. Hahne S. Karlsson M. Jörnvall H. Göransson M. Uhlin B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5658-5662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein purified by these methods was normally 90% pure. For crystallization the mutant was further purified on FPLC Mono Q 10/10 and Superdex 200 columns. The molar absorption index (ϵ280–310) for R2, 120,000 m–1cm–1, was used to determine the protein concentration. The iron content was determined colorimetrically with bathophenanthroline as an iron-chelating agent (29Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. Backes G. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The cells expressing R2-Y122F were only grown in the minimal medium to produce the iron-free apo form. Isotope Labeling of R2-Y122H—An acidic 57Fe stock solution was prepared as described by Sturgeon et al. (16Sturgeon B.E. Burdi D. Chen S. Huynh B.H. Edmondson D.E. Stubbe J. Hoffman B.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7551-7557Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The iron content in the 57Fe solution was determined using the bathophenanthroline assay (29Sahlin M. Sjöberg B.-M. Backes G. Loehr T.M. Sanders-Loehr J. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1990; 167: 813-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) after removing undissolved fragments. Cells containing the mutation R2-Y122H were grown in minimal medium as described by Åberg et al. (27Åberg A. Ormö M. Nordlund P. Sjöberg B.-M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9845-9850Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) except that the trace metal solution was omitted, and substituted with either 1 ml of 0.5% 56FeIIICl3× 6H2O for the unlabeled control, or a corresponding amount of the 57Fe stock solution for the labeled sample. This modified minimal medium was also used for global 15N labeling and for 13C, and 2H isotope labeling of amino acid residues, where the medium was supplemented with sterile filtered solution of the isotope labeled l-amino acid to a final concentration of 160 μm. The cells were harvested, and the protein was purified as described above. Reconstitution of Apoprotein R2 with Ferrous Iron and Oxygen—The reconstitution of the iron site in R2 carried out at room temperature as follows: a solution of 2 mm apoR2 (Y122H or Y122F) in air-saturated 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6 was mixed in an EPR tube with an anaerobic solution of Mohr's salt (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 (6× molar excess) dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6. The reaction was stopped by immersing the EPR tube into cold isopentane (–120 °C). To trap the FeIIIFeIV intermediate X in R2-Y122F, a rapid freeze quench apparatus (System 1000 from Update Instruments) was used to mix equal volumes of aerobic apoR2 and anaerobic Fe2+ solutions. The mixture was sprayed into a cold isopentane bath (–120 °C) to quench the reaction at time points from 8 ms to 2 s after mixing. The frozen spray was then tightly packed into an EPR tube. Hydroxyurea Treatment—In order to suppress the superimposing EPR doublet signal of Y122· from chromosomally encoded wild-type protein, the R2-Y122H protein was incubated with 10 mm hydroxyurea at 4 °C. After 30 min of incubation time the hydroxyurea was removed by running R2 through a Sephadex G-25 column. Hydroxyurea did not react with center H. Chemical Reduction—Reduction of R2-Y122H was performed in septum-sealed vials with alternating evacuation and argon flushing to minimize the presence of oxygen. To a solution of 0.2–1.0 mm protein in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, an equimolar concentration of phenazine methosulfate was added as redox mediator as well as a four times excess of either dithionite or ascorbate as reducing agent (30Atta M. Andersson K.K. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Gräslund A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 6429-6430Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Samples were extracted by an airtight Hamilton syringe and transferred to a 4-mm outer diameter EPR tube before freezing in liquid nitrogen after incubation at room temperature from 1 to 10 min. Trypsin Digestion—The trypsin digestion was performed on wild-type R2 and R2-Y122H using the following protocol (31Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification Using Tandem Mass Spectrometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, NY2000: 160-162Google Scholar): 10 μl of the 0.35 mm protein R2 was added to 100 μlof6 m urea in 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, to unfold the protein. Then 5 μl of 200 mm dithiothreitol was added to reduce the cysteine residues, and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at room temperature. Then 20 μl of 200 mm iodoacetamide was added to block all cysteine thiol groups and thereby prevent formation of unwanted disulfide bridges. After 60 min of incubation at room temperature, 20 μl of 200 mm dithiothreitol was added, which was allowed to react with any excess of iodoacetamide for another 60 min at room temperature. The solution was then diluted with 775 μl of 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, to reduce the urea concentration to below 0.6 m where trypsin is active, and then 100 μl of 0.2 ng/μl trypsin was added. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight. The reaction was terminated by addition of 5 μl of 100% acetic acid, and the samples frozen for later analysis by mass spectrometry. Continuous Wave (CW) EPR and ENDOR Instrumentation—X-band (9.5 GHz) EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer using a standard rectangular (TE102) EPR cavity (Bruker ER4102ST) equipped with an helium flow cryostat (Oxford, ESR9). CW-ENDOR spectra were measured on a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer using a self-built ENDOR accessory, which consists of a Rhode & Schwarz RF synthesizer (SMT02), an ENI A200L solid state RF amplifier, and a self-built high-Q TM110 ENDOR cavity (32Zweygart W. Thanner R. Lubitz W. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 109: 172-177Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cavity was adapted to an Oxford helium flow cryostat (ESR 910). The measured g-values were calibrated using the known g-value standard Li:LiF, with g = 2.002293 ± 0.000002 (33Stesmans A. van Gorp G. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 1989; 60: 2949-2952Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spin concentrations were determined by comparison of the double integrals of the EPR spectra with that of a 0.200 mm Cu(II)(ClO4)2 standard. Pulse ENDOR—The pulse ENDOR spectra were recorded at X-band using a Bruker ESP 380E spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments helium flow cryostat (CF935) and a Bruker ER 4118X-MD5-EN resonator. For all measurements the Davies pulse sequence (34Davies E.R. Phys. Letters A. 1974; 47: 1-2Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar) was used. The lengths of the microwave (MW) pulses (π and π/2), the radiofrequency pulse (RF), τ, and the shot repetition rate are given in the figure captions for each experiment. Simulation of EPR Powder Spectra—The EPR powder spectra have been analyzed using a program for simulation and fitting of EPR spectra with anisotropic g and hyperfine tensors based on the work of Rieger (35Rieger P.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 50: 485-489Google Scholar), which is described in Ref. 19Lendzian F. Sahlin M. MacMillan F. Bittl R. Fiege R. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.-M. Gräslund A. Lubitz W. Lassmann G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 8111-8120Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar and references therein. Thereby, resonant field positions were calculated to second order for arbitrary orientations of the g and hyperfine tensor principal axes. Mass Spectrometry—The correct incorporation of isotope-labeled amino acids into R2 was proved by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager DE or DE PRO, PE Biosystems). One microliter of apoR2 (∼0.8 μg) in 1% acetic acid was added to precrystallized matrix (excess of sinapinic acid in 95% acetone) on the sample plate. The following molecular masses of E. coli R2 proteins were determined (calculated polypeptide molecular mass in Da and number of defined amino acids per polypeptide chain in parenthesis): native R2, 43386 (43385.7); R2-Y122H, 43359 (43359; 9 His, incl. H122); R2-Y122H 13C-Asp R-C*OOH, 43364 (43384; 25 Asp); R2-Y122H 13C-Glu R-C*OOH, 43389 (43391; 32 Glu). Trypsin-digested R2 proteins were analyzed using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Voyager-RP DE) in the linear positive ion mode. The total acceleration voltage was 25 kV. The voltage on the first grid and the delay time between ion production and extraction were adapted to the mass of the different samples. For each spectrum 100 single scans were accumulated. The matrix, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was dissolved at a concentration of 15 mg/ml in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. An aliquot of 1 μl of sample (3.5 pmol) and 1 μl of matrix solution were mixed on the sample plate and air-dried. All data were calibrated by using an external calibration standard mixture (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Crystallization and Structure Determination of R2-Y122H—The mutant R2-Y122H was crystallized as described previously for metR2 (36Nordlund P. Uhlin U. Westergren C. Joelsen T. Sjöberg B.M. Eklund H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 258: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Crystals belonged to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 74.1 Å, b = 85.0 Å, c = 114.8 Å. A single crystal was soaked in a cryoprotectant solution consisting of crystal mother liquor containing an additional 20% glycerol for 5 min then flash-cooled directly in liquid N2. Data to 1.9-Å resolution were collected at the Swiss-Norwegian beamline of the ESRF synchrotron, Grenoble, France. The data were integrated and scaled using XDS (37Kabsch W. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography, Volume F. Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001Google Scholar). Further data reduction and processing utilized programs from the CCP4 package (38Collaborative Computational Project no. 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar). Details of the data quality are presented in Table I. The starting model for refinement was the 1.7-Å structure of diferrous R2 (39Logan D.T. Su X.-D. Åberg A. Regnström K. Hajdu J. Eklund H. Nordlund P.

D. 1998; 53: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13818) Google Scholar) were used for refinement. 5 cycles of rigid body refinement were carried out at 4-Å resolution followed by full refinement of atomic positions and B-factors, first at 2.5 Å then at 1.9 Å. Occupancies for Tyr122 side chain atoms were set to zero. The density for a histidine side chain was clearly visible in the difference electron density maps.

Our finding that cytosolic hsp70s showed a similar SGL binding specificity (9.Mamelak D. Mylvaganam M. Whetstone H. Hartmann E. Lennarz W. Wyrick P. Raulston J. Han H. Hoffman P. Lingwood C.

In addition, the similar SGL binding of hsp70s from prokaryotes, which contain no SGLs, questions whether SGL binding is an evolutionarily conserved or fortuitous function. hsp70 binding to the sulfogalactosyl residue is dependent on (6.Mamelak D.

Therefore, we considered whether tyrosine sulfate and SGC recognition were related and, subsequently, whether phosphotyrosine and sulfogalactose recognition could be related. Peptide mimics of carbohydrate epitopes are well known (19.Cunto-Amesty G. Luo P. Monzavi-Karbassi B. Kieber-Emmons T. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 20: 157-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reverse was also considered possible. Considerable evidence in the literature is consistent with this concept. Tyrosine sulfate conjugated to dihexadecyl (DHD) phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) prepared as described previously (18.Galustian C. Childs R.A. Stoll M. Ishida H. Kiso M. Feizi T. Immunology. 2002; 105: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was kindly supplied by Dr. T. Feizi (Imperial College, Harrow, United Kingdom). Tyrosine and tyrosine sulfate coupled to PE were prepared by the same procedure in our laboratory using both DHD and Escherichia coli diacyl-PE. 4′-SGC, 6′-SGC, and 6′-phosphogalactosylceramide (6′-PGC) were synthesized from GalCer to retain ceramide heterogeneity. The structure of these compounds was verified by mass spectrometry, and the synthetic procedure will be described elsewhere. The binding of mAb anti-SGC (Sulf1), kindly provided by Dr. P.

Human full-length c-Src cDNA was generated by transposing residues 1–875 of the 5′-cDNA sequence from human c-Src cDNA in the Bluescript plasmid (a kind gift of Dr. D.

The two c-Src fragments were recombined at a KpnI site, the construct was cloned using TA-cloning vector, and the entire sequence was verified (ACGT, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The cDNA then was introduced into pcDNA3.1/His A (Invitrogen) vector and used as a basic plasmid for construction of GST-c-SrcSH2. cDNA for c-SrcSH2 was generated from pcDNA3 using the 5′-primers Src-SH2-F (5′-GAATTCAGGCTGAGGAGTGGTATTTTGG-3′ corresponding to nt 440–461 of c-Src and the 3′-primer Src-SH2-R (5′-CTCGAGTCTGCGGCTTGGACGTGGGGCA-3′ complementary to nt 742–766 of c-Src. The full-length SHP-1 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells encoding amino acids 1–595 (bb) were amplified with oligonucleotides SHPA (5′-GATCAGGAATTCCCATGGTGAGGTGGT-3′) and SHPB (5′-TCGCTCGAGCCACCTGAGGACAGCACCGCT-3′). For making SHP-1/SH2N, SHP-1/SH2C, and SHP-1/SH2N-SH2C DNA fragments, a jumping PCR approach was applied from above full-length SHP-1 DNA template using the 5′-primer SHPA, corresponding to nt 1–16 of SHP-1, and SHP-1 SH2C-F (5′-GATCAGGAATTCCCATGGTGAGGTGGTACCATGGCCACATC-3′), corresponding to nt 1–9 and 328–345 of SHP-1), respectively, and the 3′-primer SHP-1 SH2N-R (5′-CTCGAGCCTCTCACTAGTGGGATCGGA-3′), complementary to nt 307–327 of SHP-1, and SHP-1 SH2C-R (5′-CTCGAGCACCC TCGTGGCATAGTACGG-3′), complementary to nt 634–654 of SHP-1). PCRs were performed in 50 μl of reaction mixture using 50 ng of primers and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the recommendation of manufacturer. The PCR products contained an EcoRI as well as XhoI restriction sites at the N and C termini. These DNAs were digested with EcoRI and XhoI restriction enzymes and cloned within the pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) vector at the same sites located downstream of glutathione S-transferase (GST) driven by tac promoter and in-frame with GST. The region that contained the truncations was completely sequenced to assure the effectiveness of the deletion and that no other mutations were introduced during deletion or cloning. GST-c-Src/SH2, SHP-1/SH2 C, SHP-1/SH2 N, and SHP-1/SH2 C+N proteins were overexpressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen) and transformed with the pGEX-4T-2 constructs, and the GST fusion proteins were produced as described previously (24.Ma X.Z.

A 500-ml culture of E. coli cells expressing each pGEX-4T-2/SH2 construct was grown at 37 °C until an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm was reached. The culture was then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the incubation continued for an additional 2 h. The cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication (six cycles of 50 s with a 1-min pause in between on ice). Triton X-100 to final concentration of 1% was added to the disrupted cells, and then cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. 1 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was added to the supernatant and mixed gently for 5 min at room temperature. The beads were washed three times by adding 50 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuging for 10 s at 500 × g. The fusion protein was eluted by adding 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCI, pH 8.0, and 5 mm reduced glutathione, and the purified GST protein fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for appropriate size. GSL binding of the SH2 domain fusion proteins was determined by TLC overlay, either by dot blot or chromatographically separated species. TLC chips or plates were blocked with bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with fusion proteins (∼1 μg/ml) overnight at room temperature. After washing, bound SH2-GST was detected using an anti-GST (9.Mamelak D. Mylvaganam M. Whetstone H. Hartmann E. Lennarz W. Wyrick P. Raulston J. Han H. Hoffman P. Lingwood C.

In the molecular modeling studies, the minimum energy conformations of tyrosine phosphate and of 3′-sulfogalactose were obtained from ab initio Restricted Hartree-Fock/6-31G* geometry optimization using the GAUSSIAN98 program (25.Frisch M.J.

The initial structure of 3′-sulfogalactose was derived from Protein Data Bank structure 1ONQ of a CD1-sulfatide complex (26.Zajonc D.M. Elsliger M.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) followed by initial geometry optimization at the Slater Type Orbital (STO-3G) level. Point charges for the O atoms of the sulfate and phosphate groups were obtained from the CHELPG (charges from electrostatic potentials using a grid) method (27.Breneman C.M. Wilberg K.B. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 361-373Crossref Scopus (4026) Google Scholar). Galactose 3′-sulfate was docked into the binding site of p-nitrophenyl catachol sulfate co-crystallized within the arylsulfatase substrate binding site (Protein Data Bank code 1E2S) (28.von Bulow R.

The sulfate group of galactose 3′-sulfate was forced to occupy the same position as that of pNCS with harmonic restraints, and the potential energy of the system in vacuo was minimized with a fully flexible ligand and binding pocket using the program CHARMM (Chemistry at Harvard Molecular Mechanics) (29.Brooks B.R.

Substitution of Phosphate for Sulfate and Tyrosine for Galactose: DnaK and mAb Anti-SGC Sulfogalactolipid Binding— Positional isomers of SGC were made together with the phosphate analogue of 6′-SGC, 6′-PGC. To address the effect of tyrosine substitution for galactose on ligand binding, tyrosine and tyrosine sulfate derivatives of PE, originally generated to demonstrate P and L-selectin binding (18.Galustian C. Childs R.A. Stoll M. Ishida H. Kiso M. Feizi T. Immunology. 2002; 105: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), were constructed. Fig. 1a shows that, in addition to 3′-SGC, both (non-physiological) 4′- and 6′-SGC are effectively bound by DnaK (E. coli hsp70). A comparison of the binding of 6′-SGC with 6′-PGC (Fig. 1a) shows the retention of DnaK binding following phosphate-sulfate substitution at this position. However, the tolerance for phosphate substitution within SGC is ligand-selective. The mAb anti-3′-SGC antibody, Sulf1 (20.Fredman P. Mattsson L. Andersson K. Davidsson P. Ishizuka I. Jeansson S. Mansson J.-E. Svennerholm L. Biochem. J. 1988; 251: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), while effectively binding 6′-SGC (although less than 3′-SGC), does not recognize 6′-PGC (Fig. 1c). Thus, in this case, phosphate cannot substitute for sulfate within the galactosphingolipid. Unlike DnaK, Sulf1 does not bind 4′-SGC (Fig. 1c). The doublet for 6′-SGC on TLC (hydroxyl and non-hydroxylated fatty acids) is bound by DnaK, whereas only the upper (non-hydroxylated) species is bound by Sulf1, a clear demonstration of lipid modulation of SGC binding. Both DnaK and Sulf1 tolerate galactose substitution by tyrosine. Commercially available anti-pY antibodies are routinely used to screen for phosphotyrosine proteins (32.Kamps M.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) following up-regulation of intracellular signal transduction pathways. These antibodies do not bind phosphoserine or phosphothreonine (33.Glenney Jr., J.R. Zokas L. Kamps M.P. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 109: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but may (34.Donella-Deana A. Varro A. Dockray G.J. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1095: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or may not (35.Jones J.A. Cushley W. Biosci. Rep. 1985; 5: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 36.Jones J.A. Wood A. Cushley W. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) bind sulfotyrosine. The target antigens are specific pY residues within proteins in signal transduction cascades generated by a balance between cytosolic tyrosine kinases (37.Craven R.J. Lightfoot H. Cance W.G. Surg. Oncol. 2003; 12: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and an equivalent family of phosphatases (38.Wang W.Q. Sun J.P. Zhang Z.Y. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DnaK, Sulf1, and anti-pY antibodies show significant binding to (DHD) PE-sulfotyrosine (Fig. 1, a, c, and d). However, Sulf1 preferentially bound sulfotyrosine- E. coli PE (diacyl, containing a complex mixture of fatty acid (C16:0, C16:1, and C18:1) esters (39.Urban J.E. Klopfenstein W.E. Ahmad K. Baines J.D. Can J. Microbiol. 1981; 27: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar)). Remarkably, the binding of both anti-pY and DnaK to sulfotyrosine- E. coli PE was not observed, whereas Sulf 1 showed a significant preference for sulfotyrosine- E. coli PE (Fig. 1). Thus, the character of sulfotyrosine-PE binding is typical of GSL receptors in that the lipid moiety can have a major effect on recognition. Thus, for DnaK, sulfate can be replaced by phosphate and galactose can be substituted by tyrosine. For mAb anti-SGC, galactose can be replaced by tyrosine but sulfate cannot be replaced by phosphate, at least in the 6′ position. For anti-pY, phosphate can be replaced sulfate (in a select “chemoenvironment”) but galactose cannot replace tyrosine. Recognition of the phosphotyrosine motifs within signaling proteins by downstream signaling molecules is a highly selective process that involves not only the phosphotyrosine moiety itself but its molecular environment as well (adjacent amino acids) (40.Zhang Z.Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. Maclean D. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4446-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Particularly, tyrosine residues within the cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins are prevalent adjacent to the membrane domain (41.Sipos L. von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1333-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Thus, the membrane environment may play a role in the receptor function of such residues when phosphorylated, as we have observed for GSLs (42.Lingwood C.A. Trends Glycosci. Glycotech. 1999; 11: 1-9Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The recognition of SGLs by their ligands is modulated by their “molecular environment” (the lipid moiety of the SGL) (9.Mamelak D. Mylvaganam M. Whetstone H. Hartmann E. Lennarz W. Wyrick P. Raulston J. Han H. Hoffman P. Lingwood C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3572-3582Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10.Mamelak D. Mylvaganam M. Tanahashi E. Ito H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Lingwood C. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 335: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both sulfotyrosine (Fig. 1) and sulfogalactose (10.Mamelak D. Mylvaganam M. Tanahashi E. Ito H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Lingwood C. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 335: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) ligand binding is similarly modulated by lipid conjugation, supporting a structural relationship between these epitopes. Comparison of Galactose 3′-Sulfate and Phosphotyrosine Conformation—Molecular superimposition of the minimal energy conformers of phosphotyrosine and 3′-sulfogalactose shows an essential overlap of the rings and a significant coincidence of the orientation of the sulfate and phosphate moieties. The energy-minimized conformation and charge distribution for phosphotyrosine were obtained from ab initio calculations (Fig. 2A). The conformation of 3′-sulfogalactose from the structure of the SGC/CD1a co-crystal (26.Zajonc D.M. Elsliger M.A. Teyton L. Wilson I.A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 808-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) was used as the starting point for geometry optimization (Fig. 2B). The charge distribution within the phosphate oxygen atoms is not greatly dissimilar from that of the sulfate oxygen atoms, despite the phosphate double and the sulfate single charge. This is explained by the partial delocalization of the phosphate charge within the tyrosine ring. Arylsulfatase Provides a Model for Phosphotyrosine-Sulfogalactose Equivalence—Precedent for the structural convergence of 3′-sulfogalactose and phosphotyrosine with regard to ligand binding can be found from a well studied example in the literature. The enzyme responsible for the degradation of SGC in vivo is termed arylsulfatase A. Deficiency in this enzyme activity results in the lysosomal storage disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, due to intracellular SGC accumulation (43.Gieselmann V. Matzner U. Hess B. Lullmann-Rauch R. Coenen R. Hartmann D. D'Hooge R. DeDeyn P. Nagels G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1998; 21: 564-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The name “arylsulfatase” is used because the enzyme will also desulfate various aryl substrates. Indeed, this activity was demonstrated before the natural substrate (SGC) was identified (44.Roy, A. B. (1979) CIBA Found. Symp. 177–190Google Scholar). The several aryl sulfate substrates have a substituted tyrosinelike ring structure. Arylsulfatase has recently been found to have tyrosine phosphatase activity (45.Chruszcz M. Laidler P. Monkiewicz M. Ortlund E. Lebioda L. Lewinski K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 96: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine inhibits arylsulfatase-mediated SGC desulfation (46.Stoecker P.W. Manowitz P. Harvey R. Yacynych A.M. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine and methylumbelliferyl phosphate can bind within the aryl sulfate/SGC binding site to inhibit desulfation. Moreover, the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate in phosphotyrosine cleavage has been crystallized. The covalently bound phosphate was localized in the same position as the sulfate in the enzyme p-nitrocatachol sulfate co-crystal (47.Boltes I. Czapinska H. Kahnert A. von Bulow R. Dierks T. Schmidt B. von Figura K. Kertesz M.A. Uson I. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 483-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The substrate binding site activity (45.Chruszcz M. Laidler P. Monkiewicz M. Ortlund E. Lebioda L. Lewinski K. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2003; 96: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is in a cleft lined primarily with polar residues (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, a non-polar domain within the cleft (Leu68 and Val91) is uninvolved in binding the hydrophobic aryl substrates. Since SGC has not been crystallized with the enzyme, we have modeled 3′-sulfogalactose within the substrate binding site as defined by the co-crystal (Fig. 3) (28.von Bulow R. Schmidt B. Dierks T. von Figura K. Uson I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The galactose ring occupies a position intermediate between the two conformations of the aryl ring in the co-crystal, and its hydroxyl groups can form several hydrogen bonds with the protein (Fig. 3, Table I). In addition, the 6′-CH2 makes hydrophobic contact with Val91 in the hydrophobic domain, providing additional binding energy for the natural SGL substrate (Fig. 3B). Thus, although the aryl ring provides the more non-polar substrate, it is the galactosyl substrate that utilizes the hydrophobic patch within the arylsulfatase substrate binding site. In the catachol sulfate/arylsulfatase co-crystal, a water molecule is resolved adjacent to the aryl ring, which is H-bonded to the sulfate oxygen to assist in the coordination of the bound sulfate. In our model of the sulfogalactosyl complex, the 4′-O of the polar surface of the galactose ring is superimposed on this water molecule and forms an intramolecular hydrogen bond with a sulfate oxygen (Fig. 3B and Table I). Thus, in the aryl substrate, a water molecule substitutes for the more hydrophilic character of the galactose as opposed to the catachol (or tyrosine?) ring. Thus, the hydrophobic difference between the aryl and the galactopyranose ring may be reduced, surprisingly by hydration of the aryl ring in the ligand-bound form to more closely mimic the asymmetric polarity of the galactopyranose. This solvation of the ligand-bound aryl ring is similar to the effect we have ascribed to the lipid moiety on GSL solvation for binding (48.Mylvaganam M. Lingwood C.A. Wong C.-H. Carbohydrate-based Drug Discovery. 2. Wiley-VCH Press, Weinheim, Germany2003: 761-780Google Scholar) and could similarly provide a basis for the effect of the lipid moiety on sulfotyrosine-PE binding.Table IHydrogen bonds (HB) and non-polar contacts involving galactose sulfate docked in arylsulfatase AAtom 1Atom 2SeparationCommentsnmGalactose atom (CHARMM)C-6Val91, Cγ20.32Hydrophobic contactO-4His125, Nϵ20.37Weak HBO-4Ser150, Oγ0.36Weak HBO-4Sulfate OS30.31Intramolecular HBO-1Arg288, Nη20.35HBO2Glu285, Oϵ20.29HBO2Lys302, Nζ0.27HBO-3 (sulfate)Lys302, Nζ0.31HBO-3 (sulfate)His229, Nϵ20.27HBOS1 (sulfate)Lys123, Nζ0.27HBOS2 (sulfate)Lys302, Nζ0.30HBOS2 (sulfate)Ala69, NH (backbone amide)0.34HB Open table in a new tab Both the 3′- and (non-physiological) 4′-SGC are effectively bound by hsp70 (4′< 3′) (10.Mamelak D. Mylvaganam M. Tanahashi E. Ito H. Ishida H. Kiso M. Lingwood C. Carbohydr. Res. 2001; 335: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, both catachol 3′- and 4′-sulfate are effectively bound by ligand (4′ < 3′) (49.Strobel G. Werle E. Weicker H. Biochem. Int. 1990; 20: 343-351PubMed Google Scholar). This finding suggests that vicinal sulfates in either an aryl or sugar ring can present sulfate in an equivalent format for ligand binding. In terms of hsp70/SGL binding, our model would suggest that the ATPase activity of the N-terminal domain of cytosolic (and other) hsp70s might be modulated by interaction with unknown cytosolic phosphotyrosine (or sulfotyrosine) containing polypeptides. This may provide an as yet undetected means to regulate hsp70 function. Tyrosine phosphorylation is an older post-translational modification than sulfogalactosylation. Interaction of prokaryote hsp70s with phosphotyrosine motifs could provide an evolutionary basis of the conserved SGL binding that we have observed (9.Mamelak D. Mylvaganam M. Whetstone H.

https://openalex.org/W1973081673,"DNA replication is controlled by the stepwise assembly of the pre-replicative complex and the replication apparatus. Loading of the origin recognition complex (ORC) onto the chromatin is a prerequisite for the assembly of the pre-replicative complex. To define the physiological functions of the mammalian ORC, we cloned ORC subunit cDNAs from mouse NIH3T3 cells and found novel variant forms of Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3 each derived from alternative RNA splicing. The variant form of Orc1, Orc1B, lacks 35 amino acid residues in exon 5; the variant of Orc2, Orc2B, lacks 48 amino acid residues in exon 2. In the Orc3 variant, Orc3B, only 1 amino acid residue is deleted in exon 15. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the full-length Orc1–3 subunits, Orc1A, Orc2A, and Orc3A, as well as Orc2B and Orc3B, were widely expressed in various mouse cell lines and mouse tissues. In contrast, Orc1B was only expressed in the thymus and at an early embryonic stage. Overexpression of these Orc subunits in cultured cells revealed that Orc1A, Orc2A, Orc3A, Orc2B, and Orc3B are localized in the nucleus, whereas Orc1B remains exclusively in the cytoplasm. Moreover, fusion of the 35 amino acids spliced fragment from mOrc1A with β-galactosidase resulted in its translocation into the nucleus. When Orc1B is expressed transiently, its degradation occurs in a proteasome-independent manner, whereas Orc1A is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Taken together, we conclude that mouse Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3 each exist in two alternative-splicing variants and that naturally occurring Orc1B lacks a functional domain that is essential for nuclear translocation and proteasome-dependent degradation.

Eukaryotic DNA replication is strictly controlled during the cell cycle thus ensuring that cells enter S phase only once per cell cycle. A considerable body of evidence from both yeast genetics and biochemical analysis using Xenopus egg extracts has shown that the initiation of replication requires the stepwise assembly of protein complexes on chromatin to form a pre-replicative complex (pre-RC). 1The abbreviations used are: pre-RC, pre-replicative complex; ORC, origin recognition complex; ARS, autonomously replicating sequence; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; HA, hemagglutinin A; RT, reverse transcription; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The pre-RC consists of the origin recognition complex (ORC), the minichromosome maintenance protein complex, as well as the Cdc6 and Cdt1 proteins. After activation of the pre-RC by phosphorylation through cyclin-dependent kinases and the Dbf4-dependent Cdc7 kinase, Cdc45, Mcm10, and the GINS (Go-Ichi-Ni-San; 5-1-2-3 in Japanese) complex associate with the pre-RC to form the pre-initiation complex. After Cdc45-mediated recruitment of DNA polymerases to the pre-initiation complex, DNA polymerase α initiates DNA synthesis. To maintain genome integrity and the correct ploidy, each step in the formation of the pre-RC, pre-initiation complex, and replication apparatus is tightly controlled by multiple checkpoint mechanisms (1.Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 2.DePamphilis M.L. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 310: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3.Mendez J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 1008-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As the first step in pre-RC assembly, the ORC binds to pre-replicative chromatin throughout the genome. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DNA binding sites for the ORC, consisting of an autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) consensus sequence and a B element located within regions of several hundred base pairs, were shown to act as replication origins and were defined as an ARS. Characterization of ARS binding proteins in S. cerevisiae has led to the identification of replication initiation factors as ORC (5.Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). The S. cerevisiae ORC is composed of six subunits and is stably associated with the ARS throughout cell cycle (6.Diffley J.F.

ARS-dependent formation of the pre-RC is solely responsible for ORC binding in S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (5.Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 7.Moon K.Y. Kong D. Lee J.K. Raychaudhuri S. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12367-12372Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, the S. cerevisiae ORC has additional functions within the nucleus, including transcription silencing, heterochromatin formation, and nucleosome positioning (8.Triolo T. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1996; 381: 251-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 9.Bose M.E. McConnell K.H. Gardner-Aukema K.A. Muller U. Weinreich M. Keck J.L. Fox C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 774-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10.Lipford J.R. Bell S.P. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Because most of the pre-RC components identified in S. cerevisiae have been found in other eukaryotes, including human, it is believed that the mechanisms controlling the initiation of replication are conserved in all eukaryotes (1.Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). However, the origin sequence remains to be elucidated, particularly in metazoan cells. Although several sequences have been characterized as metazoan origins of replication, most studies have suggested that initiation of DNA synthesis in metazoans is triggered at broad zones within discrete chromosomal loci (11.Gilbert D.M. Science. 2001; 294: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 12.Aladjem M.I. Fanning E. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 686-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recent findings, that homologues of the S. cerevisiae ORC exist throughout most eukaryotes, imply that its further characterization will shed light on the initiation of DNA replication in metazoan cells. Studies of the metazoan Orc proteins have revealed that the ORC complex of higher eukaryotes is unexpectedly different from the yeast ORC. First, mammalian Orc1 and Orc6 are loosely associated with the other ORC subunits, Orc2–5 (13.Vashee S. Simancek P. Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26666-26673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 14.Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29067-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Second, mammalian Orc2–5 associate with chromatin at late telophase and remain bound during subsequent cell cycle progression, whereas Orc1 binds chromatin during the G1 to S phases and gets selectively released from chromatin during the S to M phase transition (15.Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41528-41534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 16.Ohta S. Tatsumi Y. Fujita M. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41535-41540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Third, chromatin-bound Orc1 is modified during S phase by ubiquitination, which results in its degradation by a proteasome-dependent pathway during S phase (15.Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41528-41534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 17.Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H. Kim S.Y. Hidaka M. Tansey W.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Thus, the metazoan ORC might have evolved to control replication at different levels, as compared with S. cerevisiae, and may play additional roles in DNA replication of higher eukaryotes. To understand the molecular mechanisms of DNA replication in metazoan cells, it is essential to characterize the function of each subunit of the ORC complex in the replication process, especially the mechanism by which the ORC is loaded onto chromatin and the interplay between the ORC and other replication components of the pre-RC at the onset of replication. To understand the physiological function of the ORC in higher eukaryotes, we characterized the role of Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3 in mouse cell lines. By cloning cDNAs of mouse Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3, we found that an alternative splicing variant exists for each protein. Using a naturally occurring truncated mOrc1 protein, we characterized a domain crucial for nuclear translocation and degradation. cDNA Cloning of Mouse Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3 Homologues—cDNAs for mouse Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3 were amplified by PCR using sequence-specific primers and a mouse NIH3T3 cell line cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The following primers were used: mOrc1, 5′-GGGGTACCGGATCCATGCCATCCTACCTCACAAG-3′ and 5′-CCGGTACCCAATTGTCACTCTTCTTTGAGAGCAA-3′; mOrc2, 5′-GGGAATTCGGATCCATGAGCACTCTGCAGTTAAA-3′ and 5′-CCGTCGACGGTACCTATGCCTCCTCCTCTTCC-3′; mOrc3, 5′-GGCAATTGATGCACACGGGGCCGCGGACT-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGTTAACAGCCTCCCCATGTAA-3′. To construct an HA (hemagglutinin A)-tagged full-length mOrc1, the linker sequence 5′-GAATTACCACCATGGGCTACCCATACGACGTCCCAGACTACGCTGGTACCCCGAATTC-3′, encoding the HA tag, was inserted into the EcoRI site of pCAGGS mammalian expression vector (18.Jiang J. Yamato E. Miyazaki J. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 133: 423-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and named pCAGGS-HA. PCR products for mOrc1 were digested by MunI and KpnI and subcloned into EcoRI-KpnI-digested pCAGGS-HA. T7-tagged full-length mOrc1, mOrc2, and mOrc3 were constructed using XbaI-BglII-digested PCR products and the NheI-BamHI-digested mammalian expression vectors pSRHisB or pSRHisC, which contain three epitope tags (a six-His tag, T7 tag, and Xpress tag) under the control of an SRα promoter (19.Mizuno T. Yamagishi K. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7886-7896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identities of all these constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing with an Applied Biosystems 377A automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). cDNA of mOrc1B, mOrc2B, and mOrc3B—Novel variant cDNAs analyzed in this study were termed mOrc1B, mOrc2B, and mOrc3B, and the cDNA sequences have been deposited in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™, Accession numbers AB190255, AB190256, and AB190257, respectively. Mutant Plasmid Constructs—The cDNA for an NLS mutant (mOrc1A:KRR(266–268)NQQ) was amplified using the following primer pairs, 5′-AACATCTAACCAGCAGGCAGCCTTC-3′ and 5′-GAAGGCTGCCTGCTGGTTAGATGTT-3′. Mutation of the CDK phosphorylation sites in mOrc1A used the following primers: S276A, 5′-CTGAGACCACCGCGCCTCCTAAAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTTTAGGAGGCGCGGTGGTCTCAG-3′; S276D, 5′-CTGAGACCACCGATCCTCCTAAAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTTTAGGAGGATCGGTGGTCTCAG-3′; and S276E, 5′-CTGAGACCACCGAGCCTCCTAAAAAGC-3′ and 5′-GCTTTTTAGGAGGCTCGGTGGTCTCAG-3′, and the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The identities of all these constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing, as described above. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-1 cells, which are derived from the African green monkey kidney cell line CV-1, were transfected with an origin-defective SV40 virus, and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator. Swiss3T3 and FM3A (mouse mammary carcinoma) cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Transfection of COS-1 cells was performed by electroporation, as described previously (20.Sorimachi H. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Saido T.C. Kawasaki H. Sugita H. Miyasaka M. Arahata K. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10593-10605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of protein expression was analyzed 48 h after transfection unless otherwise indicated. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR Analysis—cDNAs for NIH3T3, FM3A, and Swiss3T3 cells were prepared using the Cells-to-cDNAII kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX), following the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was amplified by PCR using the TaqDNA polymerase-based PCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) under the following PCR conditions: 94 °C for 45 s, 55 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, 30 or 40 cycles for mOrc1 and mOrc2, and 94 °C for 45 s, 63.7 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, 30 or 40 cycles for mOrc3. cDNAs for mOrc1 were amplified using the reverse primer (primer b in Fig. 2A) 5′-GATGGCTTAGGTTTTACTAGGAAGC-3′, and one of the forward primers for mOrc1A and B: mOrc1A primer a, 5′-GAGTCTACGGACTCTTCCTCTTCTT-3′; mOrc1A primer c, 5′-GGTTTTACTAGGAAGCCTAACACGA-3′; mOrc1B primer d, 5′-GGTTTTACTAGGAAGCCTAATAAAC-3′. The cDNAs for mOrc2 were amplified with primer e, 5′-GGGAGATGATGATGTTCTTAGTCAC-3′, and primer f, 5′-AGCAGAATACTCACTCTCACTGTCA-3′. cDNAs for mOrc3A and mOrc3B were specifically amplified with the forward primer g, 5′-CTCTCAGAAGCCAAGAAAAGAGTAA-3′ and one of the reverse primers: mOrc3A primer h, 5′-GCATCCTCTTCCTCTTTGCTATCTG-3′, or mOrc3B primer i, 5′-GCATCCTCTTCCTCTTTGCTATCAT-3′. cDNAs from embryos and various tissues of Swiss Webster mice were purchased from Clontech and OriGene Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD), respectively. PCR products were separated by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by staining with SYBR Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cell Cycle Analysis—Swiss3T3 cells were synchronized by serum starvation using DMEM containing 0.2% fetal bovine serum for 72 h and then released by changing the medium to DMEM containing 15% fetal bovine serum. Cells were harvested at the indicated time points. Synchronized growth was monitored with a Laser Scanning Cytometer (LSC2, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with propidium iodide, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Southern Hybridization—PCR products of mOrc1A/mOrc1B and mOrc2A/mOrc2B were detected by Southern hybridization using RT-PCR samples of mOrc1B or mOrc2B, respectively, as probes. Each probe was labeled using the Random Primer DNA Labeling Kit version 2 (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan). The DNAs were transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) overnight and then fixed on the membrane by heating for 2 h at 80 °C. Hybridization was performed for 2 h at 65 °C with gentle agitation using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were washed extensively, and signals were detected by using a BAS3000 phosphorimaging device (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) or exposure to x-ray film (BioMax, Eastman Kodak). Antipeptide Antibody Preparation—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the mOrc1A internal region (C-KKSSCDSLDYQKTSKRRAAF) and the boundary region sequences in exon 5 of mOrc1B (C-KKSLELDGLGFTRKPNKPREIK) (see Fig. 3A). Immunization and affinity purification by anti-peptide-conjugated columns were performed as described previously (21.Hirano T. Kobayashi R. Hirano M. Cell. 1997; 89: 511-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed and permeabilized as described before (22.Mizuno T. Ito N. Yokoi M. Kobayashi A. Tamai K. Miyazawa H. Hanaoka F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3552-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The slides were then blocked with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum (blocking buffer) for 30 min at room temperature, incubated with anti-T7 antibody (Novagen, EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) for 12 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with PBS for 5 min each time. Cells were then incubated with Alexa-488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and counterstained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 for 20 min. The samples were sealed with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed using an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope. Antibody staining was performed as follows: primary antibodies were anti-HP1β (Serotec Ltd., Oxford, UK), anti-calreticulin (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, BC, Canada), MitoTracker (Molecular Probes), and anti-β-galactosidase (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). Preparation of Cell Extracts and Western Blot Analysis—After transfection, COS-1 cells were washed with PBS, scraped from the plates in ice-cold PBS, centrifuged for 5 min, resuspended in cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm 1, 4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C, and subjected to low speed centrifugation (3,000 rpm for 5 min). The supernatant (S1) was collected, and the insoluble chromatin fraction was digested for 30 min at 25 °C with 1,000 units/ml of RNase-free DNase I (Roche Applied Science) in cytoskeleton buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The solubilized fraction was collected by low speed centrifugation (S2). The insoluble fraction was further extracted with cytoskeleton buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.3 m KCl for 30 min at 4 °C and separated by low speed centrifugation (S3). Finally, the remaining insoluble material was extracted with 2 m NaCl buffer (10 mm 1, 4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 2 m NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA) for 30 min at 4 °C and separated by high speed (15,000 rpm) centrifugation (S4 and P). For Western analysis, samples were separated by electrophoresis using a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically onto 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica MA). After incubation of the membranes with primary antibodies in Blocking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% I-block (Tropix, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3) for 12 h at 4 °C, the membranes were washed three times with Blocking buffer, then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) in Blocking buffer. Blots were developed using the enhanced chemiluminescent reagent CDP-Star reagent (Tropix), following the manufacturer's instructions. To inhibit the proteasome, transfected COS-1 cells were treated with 20 μm Me2SO or MG132 (Calbiochem) for 10 h. cDNA Cloning of Variant Forms of Mouse Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3 Derived from Alternative Splicing—To identify the cDNAs coding for mouse Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3, PCR-based cloning was carried out using a mouse NIH3T3 cell line cDNA library as a template. PCR primers were designed as reported previously (23.Yanagi K. Mizuno T. You Z. Hanaoka F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40871-40880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found several cDNAs that are shorter than the respective full-length cDNAs for mouse Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3 deposited in the NCBI data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/mouse/index.html). For each Orc subunit gene, only one locus exists throughout the mouse genome, and sequence analysis revealed that mouse Orc1, Orc2, and Orc3 each have two isoforms derived from alternative RNA splicing. While full-length Orc1 is composed of 840 amino acid residues, the short Orc1 cDNA encodes 805 amino acid residues with 35 amino acid residues lacking in exon 5. The acceptor site for alternative splicing in exon 5 of Orc1 aligns with the canonical splice site consensus sequence (AG), whereas the donor splice site (CC) did not fit the GT consensus sequence (Fig. 1B). Such noncanonical splice sites are very rare and represent only 0.02% of all splice sites (24.Burset M. Seledtsov I.A. Solovyev V.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4364-4375Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In this report, we refer to the previously reported mouse Orc1 and the novel splicing variant of mouse Orc1 as mOrc1A and mOrc1B, respectively (Fig. 1A). As for Orc2 and Orc3, the short protein isoforms lack 48 and 1 amino acid residues encoded in exons 2 and 15 of full-length Orc2 and Orc3, respectively. The variants of mouse Orc2 and Orc3 are referred to as mOrc2B and mOrc3B (Fig. 1A). In both variants, the consensus splice site sequences matched general splicing rules. This suggests, therefore, that the mOrc2B transcript skips exon2 of the mOrc2 gene during splicing. The mechanism generating the mOrc3B transcript, which lacks CAG in exon 15 of the mOrc3 gene, is unclear, but the transcript was found in vivo (Fig. 1, C and D). Expression of Splicing Variants of Mouse Orc Subunits in Mouse Cells—To verify expression of the novel splicing variants of mOrc1B, mOrc2B, and mOrc3B, we performed RT-PCR analysis using cDNAs from several embryonic stages as well as multiple mouse tissues and cultured cells. Specific primers for mOrc1A/mOrc1B, mOrc2A/mOrc2B, and mOrc3A/mOrc3B were designed as shown in Fig. 2A, and specific products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by SYBR Green staining and/or Southern hybridization. A single transcript of the predicted size was observed when cDNA of each Orc subunit was used as a template (Fig. 2B). When primers a and b were used for mOrc1, PCR fragments corresponding to mOrc1A and mOrc1B were amplified simultaneously as 505- and 400-bp fragments, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 7). PCR with primers b and c resulted in a specific 496-bp fragment corresponding to mOrc1A (Fig. 2B, lane 5), whereas PCR using primers b and d with mOrc1B as a template, resulted in a 391 bp-fragment (Fig. 2B, lane 9). PCR products of mOrc2A and mOrc2B were simultaneously detected by primers e and f. In the case of mOrc3A/mOrc3B, the two constructs differ by only three bases in length. To distinguish mOrc3A and mOrc3B, we designed two primers completely annealing each cDNA and optimized PCR conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After improving the conditions, we could amplify specific PCR products for mOrc3A and mOrc3B using primers g and h, or g and i, respectively (Fig. 2B, lanes 13–18). RT-PCR was carried out under these conditions, for various tissues or cultured cells. As shown in Fig. 2C, PCR products for mOrc1A, mOrc2A, mOrc3A, mOrc2B, and mOrc3B were detectable in embryos as well as in most tissues, including heart, brain, muscle, kidney, spleen, testis, and small intestine. Interestingly, in contrast to mOrc3A and mOrc3B, mOrc1 and mOrc2, and variants, were scarcely detected in the liver under our conditions (lane 8), suggesting that Orc3 may have a specific function for homeostasis in mouse liver. As for mOrc2B, specific signals were found in most of the tissues. However, the ratio of mOrc2B to mOrc2A is not constant; for example, mOrc2B expression in lung, spleen, and small intestine was lower than in other tissues. Furthermore, mOrc3A and mOrc3B were scarcely detected in the lung and the thymus. Although the PCR product for mOrc1A was clearly detected throughout the developmental stages E7 to E17, mOrc1B was only detected in embryonic stage 17. In addition, a PCR product for mOrc1B was only detected in the thymus. Taken together, these results strongly suggested that mOrc1B was substantially expressed in specific environments and at certain time points during development such as the thymus or late embryonic stages. These various expression patterns for mOrc1, mOrc2, and mOrc3 in mouse tissues are consistent with its distribution in human cells (17.Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H. Kim S.Y. Hidaka M. Tansey W.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25.Thome K.C. Dhar S.K. Quintana D.G. Delmolino L. Shahsafaei A. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35233-35241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To test the distribution of mOrc subunits in cultured cells, RT-PCR analysis was carried out. PCR products for mOrc1A were clearly detected in several cultured mouse cell lines, including NIH3T3 cells, FM3A cells, and Swiss3T3 cells (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–3). Interestingly, the mOrc1A mRNA expression levels oscillated during cell growth using serum-starved and stimulated Swiss3T3 cell lines. This finding is consistent with the previous report that human Orc1 transcripts are modulated by E2F, a conserved transcription factor that plays a major role at the G1-S transition (26.Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27.Asano M. Wharton R.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2435-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In contrast, a small but significant amount of PCR product derived from Orc1B was found in cultured cells (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–3). Because mOrc1B, mOrc2B, mOrc3A, and mOrc3B mRNAs were only detectable after 40 PCR cycles, the signal intensities may not be quantitative. However, these data did confirm that expression of mOrc subunits, as well as their alternative splicing variants, occurs in different tissues and at different time points during development. Detection of mOrc1B from Thymus Tissues with an Anti-mOrc1B Antibody—To ensure that mOrc1B was substantially translated in mice, we prepared polyclonal anti-mOrc1A and mOrc1B antibodies, which were raised against peptides corresponding to a unique region in mOrc1A and the splicing junction of mOrc1B, respectively (Fig. 3A). Specificities of these antibodies were analyzed using recombinant mOrc1A or mOrc1B protein (Fig. 3B, lanes 7 and 8). Western blot analysis showed that anti-mOrc1B recognized both the mOrc1A and mOrc1B recombinant proteins. These signals disappeared completely after adding mOrc1B-derived peptides, indicating that the anti-mOrc1B antibody specifically recognizes these sequences in both mOrc1A and mOrc1B (Fig. 3B, lanes 9–12). Using this anti-mOrc1B antibody, we analyzed FM3A or thymus tissue extracts. In both extracts, a 97-kDa polypeptide band corresponding to the mOrc1A protein was detected (Fig. 3B, lanes 5 and 6, and at higher magnification in Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, a 93-kDa band, which corresponds to the mOrc1B protein, was specifically detected in thymus whole cell extracts from Swiss Webster mice (Fig. 3B, lane 5, or Fig. 3C, lane 2). When the anti-mOrc1A antibody was used for Western analysis using recombinant mOrc1A or mOrc1B protein, a single 97-kDa band was detected (data not shown), indicating that this antibody specifically detects mOrc1A, but not mOrc1B. Note that the band marked with an asterisk (in Fig. 3C, lane 3) is a nonspecific signal detected by the anti-mOrc1A antibody. Thus, using anti-peptide antibodies, we confirmed that the novel variant form of mOrc1, mOrc1B, can be detected in thymus tissues. Subcellular Distribution of Ectopically Expressed mOrc1A and mOrc1B Analyzed by Cellular Fractionation and Western Analysis—A previous report for human Orc1 showed that Orc1 is localized primarily in the insoluble nuclease-resistant fraction associated with the nuclear matrix (16.Ohta S.

To determine the subcellular distribution of mOrc subunits, including the novel variants, mOrc proteins transiently overexpressed in COS-1 cells were fractionated by simple extraction of the cells using detergent, nuclease, and increasing salt concentrations, as shown in Fig. 4A."
https://openalex.org/W1974799228,"Moesin is a member of the ERM family, a family of cross-linkers between the plasma membrane and the actin cytoskeleton, which are known to be activated by phosphorylation. Previously, we reported the RhoA and Rho kinase-dependent phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 in hippocampal neuronal cells by glutamate. Here we studied the induction of moesin phosphorylation by KCl (60 mm) in PC12 cells. Moesin phosphorylation at Thr-558 was increased after 2 min of KCl treatment, peaked at 5 min, and returned to the basal level by 60 min. KCl also activated Rac1, but not RhoA, in PC12 cells, and KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation was suppressed in dominant negative Rac1 (N17 Rac1)-expressed cells. The inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA), known as an upstream kinase of Rac1, abolished Rac1 activation and moesin phosphorylation by KCl. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of moesin by KCl was independent of KCl-induced membrane depolarization and calcium influx but was dependent on KCl-induced chloride conductance. 60 mm KCl induced chloride conductance in PC12 cells, and pretreatment with Cl– channel blocker abolished Rac1 activation and moesin phosphorylation by KCl. These results suggest that the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 in PC12 cells by KCl treatment is PKA- and Rac1-dependent and that KCl-induced chloride conductance is involved in the activation of this signaling system.

ERM proteins consist of three domains: a globular domain at the N-terminal half, which is conserved among the members of the band 4.1 superfamily and is referred to as the FERM (4.1 and ERM) domain, a membrane-binding domain, and an extended α-helical, charged C-terminal domain, which contains a consensus sequence motif for actin binding. Thus, ERM proteins have been suggested to function as cross-linkers between actin filaments and plasma membranes, and to be involved in microvilli formation, cell adhesion, cell motility, cytokinesis, phagocytosis, and the integration of membrane transport with signaling pathways (1.Bretscher A. Edwards K. Fehon R.G. Nature. 2002; 3: 586-599Google Scholar). The ERM proteins are phosphorylated in growth factor-stimulated cells (2.Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 3.Krieg J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19258-19265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In thrombin-activated platelets, moesin is phosphorylated at a specific C-terminal threonine 558 residue (Thr-558), causing filopodia formation (4.Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro functional analysis suggested that C-terminal threonine phosphorylation maintains ERM proteins in the active state by suppressing intramolecular interaction (5.Matsui T. Maeda M. Doi Y. Yonemura S. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). ERM proteins are phosphorylated and then relocalized to apical membrane protrusions in a RhoA-dependent manner in fibroblasts (6.Shaw R.J. Hary M. Solomon F. Jacks T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 403-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and at least one of the ERM proteins was shown to be required for the RhoA-dependent formation of stress fibers and focal contacts in Swiss 3T3 cells (7.Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In fibroblasts, ERM proteins are essential for Rho- and Rac-induced cytoskeletal reorganization (7.Mackay D.J. Esch F. Furthmayr H. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 927-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In addition, the expression of constitutively active mutants of the small GTPase family, Rho, Rac and Cdc42, induce phosphorylation on the C-terminal threonine residue of ERM proteins (8.Nakamura N. Oshiro N. Fukata Y. Amano M. Fukata M. Kuroda S. Matsuura Y. Leung T. Lim L. Kaibuchi K. Genes Cells. 2000; 7: 571-581Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In a previous report (9.Jeon S. Kim S. Park J.B. Suh P.G. Kim Y.S. Bae C.D. Park J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16576-16584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we also demonstrated that glutamate induces the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 through RhoA and Rho kinase activation in hippocampal neuronal cells. During development and regeneration, neurons grow over large distances in a process controlled by extrinsic factors and cytoskeletal interactions, and the suppression of radixin and moesin was found to alter growth cone morphology, motility, and process formation in primary cultured neurons (45.Paglini G. Kunda P. Quiroga S. Kosik K. Caceres A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 443-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, functional studies have established that, in sympathetic neurons, growth cone collapse induced by nerve growth factor deprivation is concomitant with a significant decrease in the radixin of growth cones (10.Gonzalez-Agosti C. Solomon F. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1996; 34: 122-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the mature peripheral nervous system, local ERM activation is implicated in the efficient formation of the nodes of Ranvier and Schwann cell differentiation (11.Gatto C.L. Walker B.J. Lambert S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest that the localization of ERM protein may be essential for the formation of neuronal growth cones and axons. Previously, we reported that electroconvulsive shock (ECS) induced the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 in the rat hippocampus (9.Jeon S. Kim S. Park J.B. Suh P.G. Kim Y.S. Bae C.D. Park J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16576-16584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ECS is used to treat psychiatric disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and manic-depressive illness. Although the mechanism of the treatment has not been elucidated, ECS has been reported to increase neurotransmitters and cAMP in rat brain (12.Pende M. Fisher T.L. Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Blenis J. Gallo V. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1291-1301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Nomikos G.G. Gruber S. Svensson T.H. Mathe A.A. Eur. Neuropsychopharmacol. 2000; 10: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), which led us to study the phosphorylation of moesin in hippocampal neuronal cells by glutamate stimulation. Because ECS is an electrical stimulus, and convulsion represents the depolarization of the neurons in the brain, it was very probable that the depolarization of neuronal cells induced by electricity may affect brain function and thus exert a therapeutic effect (33.Banken, R. (2002) The Use of Electroconvulsive Therapy in Québec, Agence d'évaluation des technologies et des modes d'intervention en santé (AET-MIS), Montreal, CanadaGoogle Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that ECS may induce moesin phosphorylation in the hippocampus by inducing depolarization in neuronal cells. So, we studied whether KCl-induced membrane depolarization increases moesin phosphorylation in PC12 cells. KCl-induced membrane depolarization is expected to activate voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and the subsequent Ca2+ influx could act as a second messenger for the activations of other signaling molecules, such as, pyk2, paxillin, and MAPK (14.Park S.-Y. Avraham H. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19768-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15.Beitner-Johnson D. Ferguson T. Rust R.T. Kobayashi S. Millhorn D.E. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). KCl treatment induced phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 in PC12 cells, and this phosphorylation was PKA- and Rac-dependent, but independent of depolarization and Ca2+ influx. Therefore, we looked for effects caused by KCl in neuronal cells in addition to depolarization. Recently, Steinert and Grissmer (16.Steinert M. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) reported that high K+ induced chloride conductance in human T lymphocytes. Here, we report that K+-induced chloride conductance is indeed involved in the activation of PKA and Rac1, and in the subsequent phosphorylation of moesin. Moreover, blocking chloride channels abolished moesin phosphorylation, but not the Ca2+-dependent activation of ERKs. These findings imply that KCl activates at least two separate pathways in PC12 cells, namely, a calcium-dependent pathway and a chloride conductance-dependent pathway. Immunoblotting—For immunoblotting, PC12 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline once, and then solubilized with 100 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Thirty micrograms of cell lysates was electrophoresed in 10% or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were then incubated with anti-moesin polyclonal (TM2), anti-phosphoERM (pThrERM) polyclonal, anti-phosphoMAPK (Cell Signals), anti-MAPK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Rac1 monoclonal (BD Transduction Laboratories) antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 0.05%), the blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, and the bands were visualized using the ECL system (Pierce). Molecular weights were determined by comparing the mobilities of protein bands with prestained molecular weight markers (Invitrogen). Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in RPMI containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C, under 5% CO2. PC12 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 in a 6-well plate coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). For KCl treatment, the cells were cultured in RPMI containing 0.5% horse serum for 16 h. The next morning, the medium was replaced with Kreb's bicarbonate buffer (126 mm NaCl, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 25 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.3) for 1 h and then stimulated with or without 60 mm KCl for various periods (2, 5, 10, 30, and 60 min). To induce membrane depolarization, PC12 cells were incubated in Kreb's bicarbonate buffer containing the potassium channel blockers, 1 mm TEA, and 10 mm BaCl, for 5 min. For the inhibition experiments, PC12 cells were incubated in Kreb's bicarbonate buffer containing 10 μm protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89, 10 μm myristoylated PKA inhibitor peptide (Calbiochem, #476485), 10 μm nifedipine, 200 μm NPPB (5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid), 500 μm SITS (4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2′-disulfonic acid), or 1 mm 9-anthracene carboxylic acid for 30 min before KCl treatment. 1 mm EGTA was added to the culture medium 10 min before the KCl treatment to chelate calcium in the media. To establish stably expressed N17Rac1 PC12 cells, plasmids (3.2 μg of pcDNA N17Rac1 or empty vectors) were transfected into the PC12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were then selected using 500 μg/ml G418 for 3 days and then maintained in 50 μg/ml G418. Cloned cells were verified by immunoblotting cell lysates with anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody. The transfected cells were cultured in RPMI containing 0.5% horse serum for 16 h and then stimulated with or without 60 mm KCl for 10 min. RhoA and Rac1 Activity Assays—RhoA and Rac1 activities were measured as described by Ren et al. (17.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). PC12 cells (2 × 107 cells) were seeded in 100-mm culture dishes and serum-starved in 0.5% horse serum RPMI for 18 h. The cells were then treated with or without 60 mm KCl. For RhoA activity assays, the cells were lysed with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 15 min on ice. The cell lysates were then passed 10 times through a 23-gauge needle and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with 30 μg of the GST-Rho-binding domain of mouse rhotekin (GST-RBD)-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 4 °C. For Rac1 activity assays, cells were resuspended in 200 μl of NS buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 10 min on ice, and then passed 10 times through a 23-gauge needle. After adding 200 μlof 2× no-salt-lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), cell lysates were passed through a 23-gauge needle 10 times, and then placed on ice for 5 min. 400 μl of high salt-binding buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 30 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) was then added, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated with 30 μg of the GST-Rac/Cdc42-binding domain of rat PAK3 (GST-PBD)-bound glutathione-Sepharose beads for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with wash buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40 mm NaCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli sample buffer, separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting with mouse monoclonal anti-RhoA and anti-Rac1 antibodies. Whole-cell Patch Clamp—Cells were transferred into a bath on the stage of an inverted microscope (IX-70, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The bath (∼0.3 ml) was superfused with a modified Tyrode's solution, as described previously (16.Steinert M. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), containing 160 mm NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm glucose, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. For high KCl bath solution all Na+ was replaced by an equimolar amount of K+. For selectively recording Cl– currents, a mixture of K+ channel blockers (10 mm TEA and 1 mm BaCl2) was added to the bath perfusate (both NaCl and KCl bath solution). The pipette solution contained 155 mm potassium aspartate, 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 mm Mg-ATP, at pH 7.4 (titrated with KOH). The bath was superfused at a velocity of 10 ml/min, and voltage clamp experiments were performed at room temperature. Patch pipettes with a free-tip resistance of 2.5–3 megohms were connected to the head stage of a patch-clamp amplifier (Axopatch-1D, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Liquid junction potentials were corrected for using an offset circuit before each experiment and a KCl (1 m)-agar bridge was used as a reference. pCLAMP software version 7.0 and Digidata-1200A (both from Axon Instruments) were used for data acquisition and to apply command pulses. Voltage and current data were low pass filtered (5 kHz), stored in a Pentium-grade computer, and analyzed using Origin version 6.1 software (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, CA). Moesin Phosphorylation at Thr-558 in 60 mm KCl-treated PC12 Cells—ERM protein expressions are tissue type-dependent. Therefore, we examined the levels of each ERM family protein in PC12 cells. As was found in H19–7/IGF-IR cells, moesin was the predominant ERM protein in PC12 cells; ezrin was also expressed but at a much lower level than moesin, and radixin was barely expressed (data not shown), which was consistent with a previous report (18.Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 180-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Anti-p-ThrERM antibody detected mainly one band in PC12 cell lysate, and this band corresponded to moesin. Thr-558 of moesin was phosphorylated in PC12 cells even without stimulation, as reported previously (4.Nakamura F. Amieva M.R. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31377-31385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), but 60 mm KCl treatment rapidly increased moesin phosphorylation at Thr-558. Moesin phosphorylation was transient; it increased at 2 min, peaked at 5 min (twice the basal level), which lasted until 30 min, and returned to basal level after 60 min of KCl treatment (Fig. 1). At which time the amount of moesin was unchanged versus its initial level; this was confirmed by reprobing the membrane with the moesin-specific antibody, TM2 (Fig. 1). Rac1 Is Involved in the Phosphorylation of Moesin Induced by KCl—The Rho family proteins, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, have been implicated in the phosphorylation of moesin in various cell lines; previously we reported that RhoA is activated by glutamate treatment in hippocampal neuronal cells (9.Jeon S. Kim S. Park J.B. Suh P.G. Kim Y.S. Bae C.D. Park J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16576-16584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To determine whether the RhoA family proteins are involved in the phosphorylation of moesin by KCl, we examined the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and of Cdc42 in PC12 cells after 60 mm KCl treatment by measuring the amounts of RhoA bound to the GST-fused RhoA-binding domain of rhotekin (GST-RBD) or Rac1/Cdc42 bound to the GST-fused Rac/Cdc42-binding domain of PAK3 (GST-PBD). KCl treatment induced a rapid increase in the amount of cellular GTP-bound Rac1 in PC12 cells but did not increase the amount of cellular GTP-bound RhoA (Fig. 2). The amount of GTP-bound Cdc42 was barely detectable in either KCl-treated or untreated PC12 cells, suggesting that the activity of Cdc42 in PC12 cells was very low and was not increased by KCl treatment (data not shown). These results indicate that KCl activates Rac1, but not RhoA, in PC12 cells. Increased Rac1 activity was observed after 2 min of KCl treatment, and this gradually increased to 10 min, which coincided with the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558, thus suggesting that Rac1 might be involved in the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558. To confirm the involvement of Rac1 in moesin phosphorylation, we established PC12 cells expressing dominant negative Rac1, N17 Rac1, and vector-only-transfected cells. We selected two clones (numbers 9 and 38), which expressed more than three times as much N17Rac1 as endogenous Rac1 (Fig. 3A). KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation was significantly suppressed in both of the N17Rac1-expressing cells (Fig. 3B), but not in control cells. These results indicate that Rac1 is indeed involved in moesin phosphorylation by KCl in PC12 cells. Previously, we demonstrated that Rho-kinase is downstream of Rho in glutamate-induced moesin phosphorylation in hippocampal neuronal cells. Thus we studied whether Rho-kinase is also downstream of Rac1 in the KCl-induced phosphorylation of moesin in PC12 cells, however, we found that pretreatment with the Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, did not suppress KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation (data not shown). Further study will be needed to elucidate the kinase involved in moesin phosphorylation, which is activated by KCl treatment as a downstream effecter of Rac1 in PC12 cells.Fig. 3Rac1 is involved in the phosphorylation of moesin by KCl treatment in PC12 cells.A, PC12 cells were transfected with empty vector DNA (Vector) or pc DNA N17Rac1 (N17Rac1), and the transfected cells were selected with G418. To confirm Rac1 expression, cloned cell lysate (numbers 38 and 9) was electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Rac1 antibody. B, Rac1-overexpressed cells (38 and 9) were unstimulated or stimulated with 60 mm KCl for 5 min, and whole cell lysates were electrophoresed in SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p-ThrERM or TM2 antibodies. Densitometric analysis was then performed, and data are presented as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments (bottom panel). “C” represents unstimulated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) KCl-induced Rac1 Activation Is Dependent on PKA in PC12 Cells—In previous study, we were unable to identify the upstream signaling pathway of Rho activation by glutamate treatment in hippocampal neuronal cells, because the pathways upstream of RhoA are not known. On the other hand, PKA has been suggested to be an upstream kinase for the activation of Rac1 in EGF-stimulated cells (19.O'Connor K.L. Mercurio A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47895-47900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility of PKA involvement in the activation of Rac1 by KCl treatment in PC12 cells. The inhibition of PKA activity with a specific inhibitor H89, completely abolished Rac1 activation (Fig. 4A) and moesin phosphorylation in PC12 cells (Fig. 4B). Because H89 is known to inhibit other kinases in addition to PKA (20.Davis S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we studied the effect of another PKA inhibitor, cell-permeable myristoylated PKA inhibitor peptide (14–22 amide), on the phosphorylation of moesin. The myristoylated PKA inhibitor peptide also abolished the phosphorylation of moesin after KCl treatment (data not shown). To confirm PKA involvement in moesin phosphorylation, PC12 cells were treated with 10 μm forskolin to increase intracellular cAMP levels, and it was found that the temporal pattern of forskolin-induced moesin phosphorylation was similar to that of KCl treatment (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that PKA activation is involved in the activation of Rac1 and in the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 in PC12 cells by KCl treatment. Although the inhibition of PKA and Rac1 abolished moesin phosphorylation by KCl treatment, it did not affect the basal level of phosphorylated moesin, suggesting another pathway of moesin phosphorylation exists in PC12 cells and that it is independent of PKA and Rac1 activation. We previously reported a RhoA-dependent pathway in hippocampal neuronal cells (9.Jeon S. Kim S. Park J.B. Suh P.G. Kim Y.S. Bae C.D. Park J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16576-16584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the present study indicates that at least two Rho family proteins are involved independently in the phosphorylation of moesin at Thr-558 in neuronal cells and that these are activated in stimulus-specific manner. KCl-induced Moesin Phosphorylation Is Independent of Calcium Influx and Membrane Depolarization in PC12 Cells—KCl treatment of PC12 cells induces plasma membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx into the cells. To examine whether KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation at Thr-558 is dependent on Ca2+ influx, we eliminated calcium from the culture medium before KCl treatment. The elimination of extracellular Ca2+ with 1 mm EGTA did not suppress KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation at Thr-558 in PC12 cells (Fig. 5A). To confirm the result, we inhibited the L-type calcium channels with a specific blocker, nifedipine, because it is known that KCl-induced depolarization increases Ca2+ influx into cells mainly by opening these calcium channels in PC12 cells (21.Mark M.D. Liu Y. Wong S.T. Hinds T.R. Storm D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Nifedipine also failed to inhibit KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Moreover, the elimination of intracellular calcium with 10 μm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic (BAPTA-AM) did not affect KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation (data not shown). We also examined the calcium dependence of Rac1 activation by KCl in PC12 cells and found that nifedipine treatment had no effect on KCl-induced Rac1 activation (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation is independent of calcium signaling pathways in PC12 cells. We then examined whether membrane depolarization per se is involved in moesin phosphorylation. To evoke membrane depolarization without changing the extracellular K+ concentration, a mixture of K+ channel blockers (1 mm TEA and 10 mm BaCl) was applied. Combined treatment with TEA and Ba2+ did not induce moesin phosphorylation, but it did induce strong calcium-dependent (data not shown) MAPK phosphorylation in PC12 cells (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that 60 mm KCl induced membrane depolarization in PC12 cells but that this depolarization was not responsible for KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation. Increasing Cl–Conductance by Increasing Extracellular K+in PC12 Cells—The results above suggest that neither voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx nor membrane depolarization is responsible for KCl-induced moesin phosphorylation in PC 12 cells. Thus, it was tempting to hypothesize that an increase in extracellular K+ ([K+]ext) directly regulates theses signaling mechanisms in PC12 cells. In lymphocytes and osteoblasts, it has been reported that an isotonic increase of [K+]ext increased chloride conductance (16.Steinert M. Grissmer S. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22.Brauer M. Frei E. Claes L. Grissmer S. Jager H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether 60 mm KCl changes chloride conductance in PC12 cells by using the whole cell patch clamp technique. Fig. 6 shows an averaged series of currents elicited by voltage ramps from –90 to 60 mV (0.03 V/s) obtained from four PC12 cells. Throughout the experiment, a mixture of K+ channel blockers (1 mm BaCl and 10 mm TEA) was used to minimize the interference from K+ currents. The membrane current induced by ramp depolarization showed an outwardly rectifying shape in the control solution. However, the application of KCl bath solution increased this membrane conductance, which peaked after 10 min, while retaining this outwardly rectifying shape. The addition of Cl– channel blocker (200 μm NPPB) completely abolished the outwardly rectifying current and the basal current, indicating that both KCl-induced and basal level conductance were chloride channel-dependent. Under the KCl bath solution (i.e. isotonic replacement of NaCl with KCl, see “Experimental Procedures”), the equilibrium potential for K+ (EK) was very close to 0 mV according to the Nernst equation: EK = 58 mV × log(164.5 mm/155 mm) = 1.5 mV. In contrast, considering the partial permeability of aspartate to Cl– channels (Paspartate/PCl = 0.1, Ref. 22.Brauer M. Frei E. Claes L. Grissmer S. Jager H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: 22-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the net equilibrium potential for permeable anion would be 58 mV × log{[6 mm + (0.1 × 155 mm)]/170.5}, approximately –52 mV. The high K+-induced membrane current in PC12 cells reversed its direction at –40 mV, i.e. close to –52 mV but far from 0 mV (arrowhead in Fig. 6). Taken together with the sensitivity of chloride conductance to NPPB, these data suggest that an isotonic increase of extracellular K+ activates outwardly rectifying Cl– channels in PC12 cells. KCl-induced Rac1 Activation and Moesin Phosphorylation Are Dependent on the Activation of Cl–Channels in PC12 Cells—To determine whether KCl-induced chloride current is involved in Rac1 activation and moesin phosphorylation in PC12 ells, we pre-treated PC12 cells with the volume-sensitive Cl– channel blocker, NPPB (200 μm). To exclude the possibility that moesin phosphorylation by 60 mm KCl might be induced by the hyperosmolarity caused by"
