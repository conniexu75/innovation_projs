https://openalex.org/W3129399011,"During the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, a D614G substitution in the spike glycoprotein (S) has emerged; virus containing this substitution has become the predominant circulating variant in the COVID-19 pandemic1. However, whether the increasing prevalence of this variant reflects a fitness advantage that improves replication and/or transmission in humans or is merely due to founder effects remains unknown. Here we use isogenic SARS-CoV-2 variants to demonstrate that the variant that contains S(D614G) has enhanced binding to the human cell-surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), increased replication in primary human bronchial and nasal airway epithelial cultures as well as in a human ACE2 knock-in mouse model, and markedly increased replication and transmissibility in hamster and ferret models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that the D614G substitution in S results in subtle increases in binding and replication in vitro, and provides a real competitive advantage in vivo-particularly during the transmission bottleneck. Our data therefore provide an explanation for the global predominance of the variant that contains S(D614G) among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses that are currently circulating."
https://openalex.org/W3109007711,"Background Identified in December 2019 in the city of Wuhan, China, the outbreak of COVID-19 spread throughout the world and its impacts affect different populations differently, where countries with high levels of social and economic inequality such as Brazil gain prominence, for understanding of the vulnerability factors associated with the disease. Given this scenario, in the absence of a vaccine or safe and effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19, nonpharmacological measures are essential for prevention and control of the disease. However, many of these measures are not feasible for millions of individuals who live in territories with increased social vulnerability. The study aims to analyze the spatial distribution of COVID-19 incidence in Brazil’s municipalities (counties) and investigate its association with sociodemographic determinants to better understand the social context and the epidemic’s spread in the country. Methods This is an analytical ecological study using data from various sources. The study period was February 25 to September 26, 2020. Data analysis used global regression models: ordinary least squares (OLS), spatial autoregressive model (SAR), and conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the local regression model called multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR). Findings The higher the GINI index, the higher the incidence of the disease at the municipal level. Likewise, the higher the nurse ratio per 1,000 inhabitants in the municipalities, the higher the COVID-19 incidence. Meanwhile, the proportional mortality ratio was inversely associated with incidence of the disease. Discussion Social inequality increased the risk of COVID-19 in the municipalities. Better social development of the municipalities was associated with lower risk of the disease. Greater access to health services improved the diagnosis and notification of the disease and was associated with more cases in the municipalities. Despite universal susceptibility to COVID-19, populations with increased social vulnerability were more exposed to risk of the illness."
https://openalex.org/W3131436668,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a major threat to global health. Vaccines are ideal solutions to prevent infection, but treatments are also needed for those who have contracted the virus to limit negative outcomes, when vaccines are not applicable. Viruses must cross host cell membranes during their life cycle, creating a dependency on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study, we examined whether the synthetic machinery for glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as a therapeutic target to combat SARS-CoV-2. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS): (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the United States Food and Drug Administration-approved drug Cerdelga and (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat, which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, these inhibitors also disrupt replication of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Our data imply that synthesis of glycosphingolipids is necessary to support viral life cycles and suggest that GCS inhibitors should be further explored as antiviral therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3133077596,"Sialic acid (Sia)-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 7 (Siglec-7) is an inhibitory receptor primarily expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and monocytes. Siglec-7 is known to negatively regulate the innate immune system through Sia binding to distinguish self and nonself; however, a counter-receptor bearing its natural ligand remains largely unclear. Here, we identified a counter-receptor of Siglec-7 using K562 hematopoietic carcinoma cells presenting cell surface ligands for Siglec-7. We affinity-purified the ligands using Fc-ligated recombinant Siglec-7 and diSia-dextran polymer, a strong inhibitor for Siglec-7. We then confirmed the counter-receptor for Siglec-7 as leukosialin (CD43) through mass spectrometry, immunoprecipitation, and proximity labeling. Additionally, we demonstrated that the cytotoxicity of NK cells toward K562 cells was suppressed by overexpression of leukosialin in a Siglec-7-dependent manner. Taken together, our data suggest that leukosialin on K562 is a counter-receptor for Siglec-7 on NK cells and that a cluster of the Sia-containing glycan epitope on leukosialin is key as trans-ligand for unmasking the cis-ligand.

Siglecs are sialic-acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins that are mainly expressed on immune cells in a cell-type-specific manner (1Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Varki A. Siglecs and their roles in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Siglecs are type I membrane immunoreceptors containing a Sia-binding N-terminal V-set domain and several C2-type Ig-like domains that act as regulators of oligomerization or as spacers in projecting the ligand-binding site away from the membrane surface. The majority of Siglecs are involved in the innate immune system by distinguishing molecules as self or nonself; Sia is considered a self-molecule (1Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Varki A. Siglecs and their roles in the immune system.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Siglecs regulate immune cell functions by binding to Sia residues. Disrupting these interactions causes changes in the states of infection, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. It is known that enhanced sialylation on the surface of cancer cells is relevant in their escape mechanism from the host immune system (2Macauley M.S. Crocker P.R. Paulson J.C. Siglec-mediated regulation of immune cell function in disease.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014; 14: 653-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar); therefore, Siglecs are used as targeting therapeutic molecules toward cancer cells for drug delivery (3Angata T. Nycholat C.M.

Siglec-7 (CD328), a member of the human CD33-related Siglecs, is localized predominantly on human NK cells and monocytes. Siglec-7 consists of an extracellular N-terminal V-set domain, two C2-type Ig-like domains, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif in the cytosolic region (7Nicoll G. Ni J. Liu D. Klenerman P. Munday J. Dubock S. Mattei M.G. Crocker P.R. Identification and characterization of a novel Siglec, Siglec-7, expressed by human natural killer cells and monocytes.J. Biol.

Siglec-7: A sialic acid-binding lectin of the immunoglobulin superfamily.Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It acts as an inhibitory receptor in a Sia-binding-dependent manner. The recognition of Siglec ligands is usually modulated by the endogenous ligands at the cellular surface via cis-interaction, which is known as masking (3Angata T. Nycholat C.M. Macauley M.S.

Bovin N. Crocker P. Ganglioside GD3 expression on target cells can modulate NK cell cytotoxicity via siglec-7-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Eur. J. Immunol. 2003; 33: 1642-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The masking effect was clearly shown for CD22, which specifically binds to α2,6-linked Sia on B cells (9Razi N. Varki A. Masking and unmasking of the sialic acid-binding lectin activity of CD22 (Siglec-2) on B lymphocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7469-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Unmasking was achieved by exogenous addition of sialidase or cellular activation (11Freeman S.D. Kelm S. Barber E.K. Crocker P.R.

It has also been shown that microglia activation by pathogens or inflammatory cytokines causes glycan-related degrading enzymes, such as the sialidase Neu1, to reduce Sia on the cell surface (14Sumida M.

However, the natural unmasking mechanism of NK cells, which is involved in the surveillance system, and the identity of the trans-ligand on the cancer cells that escape from NK cell remain unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to confirm the natural trans-ligand for Siglec-7 for further understanding of the cis-ligand unmasking mechanism. The glycan structure of the ligand for Siglec-7 has been studied in part. Siglec-7 binds to the Neu5Acα2,8Neu5Acα2- (diSia) sequence present within the GD3 structure and the branched α2,6-sialyl residues present in DSGb5 and DSLc4 (15Yamaji T. Teranishi T. Alphey M.S.

The clustering of diSia epitopes is also important for enhancing the affinity of molecular units for the binding to Siglec-7 (8Angata T. Varki A. Siglec-7: A sialic acid-binding lectin of the immunoglobulin superfamily.Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Complex ligand specificity has also been shown by several sets of glycan array experiments [http://www.functionalglycomics.org/glycomics/publicdata/primaryscreen.jsp]. Although it is still unknown why such complex specificity occurs in the region of the Siglec-7 V-set domain containing residue R124, which was proven by X-ray crystallography as necessary for ligand binding (17Alphey M.S.

Yasuda Y. Yoshimura A. Goshima A. Crocker P.R. Vergoten G. Nishiura Y. Takahashi T. Hanashima S. Matsumoto K. Yamaguchi Y. Tanaka H. Kitajima K. Sato C.

Functional analysis of Siglec-7 in sialidase-treated NK cells, with the ganglioside ligands GD3 and DSGb5 was shown to inhibit NK cell cytotoxicity toward GD3-or DSGb5-expressing cancer cells (10Nicoll G. Avril T. Lock K. Furukawa K. Bovin N. Crocker P. Ganglioside GD3 expression on target cells can modulate NK cell cytotoxicity via siglec-7-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Eur. J.

Ganglioside DSGb5, preferred ligand for Siglec-7, inhibits NK cell cytotoxicity against renal cell carcinoma cells.Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1373-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, the counter-receptor for Siglec-7 in cancer cells and its involvement in NK cell functions are still unknown. Recently, we demonstrated the presence of the counter-receptor for Siglec-7 in K562 cancer cells, often used as the target cells for NK cytotoxicity assays (20Yoshimura A. Hatanaka R. Tanaka H. Kitajima K. Sato C. The conserved arginine residue in all Siglecs is essential for Siglec-7 binding to sialic acid.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 534: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the counter-receptor for Siglec-7 using diSia-dextran (diSia-Dex), a strong inhibitor of Siglec-7-ligand binding, and demonstrated its involvement in cytotoxicity. Recently, we identified the presence of the counter-receptor for Siglec-7 on the K562 cell surface (20Yoshimura A. Hatanaka R. Tanaka H. Kitajima K. Sato C. The conserved arginine residue in all Siglecs is essential for Siglec-7 binding to sialic acid.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 534: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we investigated whether K562 and HeLa cells express natural ligands for Siglec-7 on their surfaces (21Jandus C. Boligan K.F. Chijioke O. Liu H. Dahlhaus M. Démoulins T. Schneider C. Wehrli M. Hunger R.E. Baerlocher G.M. Simon H.U. Romero P. Münz C. von Gunten S. Interactions between Siglec-7/9 receptors and ligands influence NK cell-dependent tumor immunosurveillance.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Both K562 and HeLa cells had ligands for Siglec-7 on the cell surface, as demonstrated by flow cytometry (Fig. 1A), and the binding was Sia-dependent because Siglec-7 binding disappeared after sialidase treatment (Fig. 1A). In addition, the Siglec-7 R124A mutant, in which the Arg residue essential for Sia binding is replaced by Ala (18Attrill H. Imamura A. Sharma R.S. Kiso M. Crocker P.R. van Aalten D.M.

Commun. 2020; 534: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), showed no binding, indicating that binding occurred with the V-set domain of Siglec-7. The binding signal of Siglec-7 to K562 was stronger than that of HeLa cells, indicating that K562 expressed the ligands at a higher level than HeLa cells. To confirm the presence of the counter-receptor for Siglec-7, pull-down assays were performed using Siglec-7EcFc on K562 and HeLa cell homogenates. As shown in Figure 1B, a 110kDa-gp was observed in K562, and a 270kDa-gp was observed in both K562 and HeLa. The results obtained in K562 cells were consistent with those of our previous study (20Yoshimura A. Hatanaka R. Tanaka H. Kitajima K. Sato C. The conserved arginine residue in all Siglecs is essential for Siglec-7 binding to sialic acid.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2020; 534: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). To analyze the glycan structures of the Siglec-7 counter-receptor, enzyme digestion with sialidase and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was performed on K562 homogenates. Removal of N-linked glycans by PNGase F did not decrease the Siglec-7 staining; however, sialidase treatment markedly abolished this signal (Fig. 1C). It is noteworthy that a weakly stained band appeared at a molecular weight of 105 kDa after PNGase F digestion. Using an anti-diSiaα2,3Gal antibody, S2-566 (22Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the 110kDa-gp was observed at a lower level than the other stained bands in a Sia-dependent manner but not in an N-glycan dependent manner. Next, to develop a method for purification of the counter-receptor, we used diSia-Dex, which has been demonstrated to inhibit the binding of Siglec-7 to the diSia-containing ganglioside, GD3 (23Yamaguchi S. Yoshimura A. Yasuda Y. Mori A. Tanaka H. Takahashi T. Kitajima K. Sato C. Chemical synthesis and evaluation of a disialic acid-containing dextran polymer as an inhibitor for the interaction between Siglec 7 and its ligand.Chembiochem. 2017; 18: 1194-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 2A, the binding to K562 was strongly inhibited by diSia-Dex, but not by Dex alone, indicating that Siglec-7 binding was competitive with diSia epitopes. To determine the ability of diSia-Dex to release the counter-receptor from Siglec-7, we performed a pull-down assay for K562 cell homogenates and attempted to elute the ligand using diSia-Dex. As shown in Figure 2B, diSia-Dex successfully released 110kDa-gp and 270kDa-gp, which were confirmed to be present on the cell surface via cell surface biotin labeling. The coprecipitated proteins (gel) contained these two components. DiSia-Dex-eluted components of the same size were also detected by Siglec-7 blotting, suggesting that they are counter-receptors for Siglec-7. Upon silver staining, several components were visualized in both the diSia-Dex-eluted and gel fractions. These data suggest that the 110kDa- and 270kDa-gps are surface counter-receptors for Siglec-7 and that several other proteins are also associated via indirect binding to Siglec-7. To identify the cell surface counter-receptor for Siglec-7, it was purified by affinity chromatography using a Siglec-7 column. Proteins captured by Siglec-7 from the membrane fraction and the whole cell lysate were eluted with Dex for nonspecific release or with diSia-Dex for specific release. As shown in Figure 3, the 110kDa-gp could be purified from the membrane fraction and the whole cell lysate by diSia-Dex, and the 270kDa-gp could be purified from the whole cell lysate (Fig. 3). To identify the 110kDa-gp and 270kDa-gp observed by Siglec-7 blotting, we excised the bands at approximately 110 kDa and 270 kDa on the silver stained gel, treated them with trypsin, and performed LC-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS analysis. Based on several trials of MS and ProteinPilot software analyses (Table S1), we identified leukosialin (CD43/sialophorin: gene name SPN), nucleolin (gene name: NCL), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (gene name: HNRNPU) as potential counter-receptor candidates for Siglec-7 with an approximate molecular weight of 110 kDa. MS analyses for 270kDa-gp were not successful due to the small amount of purified proteins. To confirm the MS results, we analyzed the purified fraction by western blotting with specific antibodies against these proteins. As shown in Figure 4, SPN protein bands were clearly observed at approximately 110 kDa by Siglec-7 blotting (Fig. 4A) using both the cell lysate and the Siglec-7 purified fraction. After sialidase treatment, the band shifted but did not disappear, indicating that the SPN was sialylated (Fig. 4B). Migration also decreased, indicating the presence of heavy sialylation on SPN. The 270kDa-gp observed by Siglec-7 blotting was not observed using the anti-SPN antibody, indicating that this was not an oligomeric form of the SPN protein. SPN staining was most intense in the cell lysate, but the staining was faint in the Siglec-7 purified fraction (Fig. 4B), indicating that the glycan epitope recognized by Siglec-7 is, in part, on SPN. Using anti-NCL and -HNRNPU antibodies, we found bands around the 110kDa-gp band (Fig. 4, C and D). The HNRNPU and NCL bands were observed only after sialidase treatment in the Siglec-7 purified proteins (Fig. 4, C and D). To confirm this, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis. We immunoprecipitated an identified counter receptor for Siglec-7, SPN, and NCL and immunoblotted them with Siglec-7EcFc, anti-SPN, anti-NCL, and anti-HNRNPU antibodies. As shown in Figure 5, SPN-immunoprecipitated 110kDa-gp was detected with Siglec-7EcFc and anti-SPN. However, the immunoprecipitated NCL protein was not detected using either Siglec-7EcFc or anti-SPN but was observed using an anti-NCL antibody. In addition, the anti-NCL antibody immunoprecipitated a 120 kDa band that was observed with the anti-HNRNPU antibody, indicating that the complex of HNRNPU and NCL was precipitated using the anti-NCL antibody.Figure 5Immunoprecipitation of candidate molecules for Siglec-7 by specific antibodies. Leukosialin and nucleolin were immunoprecipitated with antileukosialin or antinucleolin antibodies (2 μl) from K562 lysate (200 μg).

Chen Y.J. Fan C.Y. Tang C.J. Chen Y.H. Low P.Y. Ventura A. Lin C.C. Angata T. Identification of Siglec ligands using a proximity labeling method.J. Proteome Res. 2017; 16: 3929-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Siglec-9, which favors monoSia ligands and shows binding activity with K562, was used for comparison, and Fc was used as a negative control. After binding with Siglec-7-EcFc, Siglec-9EcFc, and Fc to the surface of K562 cells, we labeled the proteins present near Siglec-7, Siglec-9, and Fc using H2O2 and biotinyl-tyramide. We then analyzed the biotin-labeled lysates via streptavidin and found that the 110kDa-gp and a 170kDa-gp were labeled with Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, but Siglec-7 labeling was more intense (Fig. 6A). Then, biotinylated molecules were purified using streptavidin beads and blotted using streptavidin and Siglec-7EcFc. As shown in Figure 6C, the 110kDa-gp was clearly stained using Siglec-7 and faint using Siglec-9 but not using the negative control of Fc. Streptavidin blot analysis also showed similar results for 110kDa-gp (Fig. 6B). We then analyzed with anti-SPN antibody and found that the 110kDa-gp, which was precipitated from lysates proximity-labeled using Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, could also be detected (Fig. 6D). Taken together, these results indicate that SPN on the surface of K562 cells was a counter-receptor for Siglec-7 and Siglec-9, although the SPN association with Siglec-7 was more pronounced. To understand the biological significance of the interaction between SPN and Siglec-7, we established K562 cell lines in which SPN was either stably overexpressed or knocked down by RNA interference. We named the cells K562-SPN and K562-shSPN, respectively. First, the cells were validated by flow cytometry using anti-SPN antibody and Siglec-7. As shown in Figure 7A, K562-SPN expressed SPN at a higher level and K562-shSPN expressed SPN at a lower level on the cell surface than K562-mock. Unexpectedly, Siglec-7 binding was not correlated with the expression levels of SPN, but rather inversely correlated to a small extent. We then analyzed the Siglec-7-labeled cell surface proteins by the PL method. As shown in Figure 7B, the 110kDa-gp was observed using the streptavidin probe, although K562-SPN showed doublet bands. The expression levels of endogenous and exogenous SPN were confirmed using anti-SPN and anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 7, D and E). The loading control is shown in Figure 7C. The anti-SPN antibody could recognize the endogenous and exogenous SPN, because the doublet bands around 110 kDa in Figure 7B were also observed in the anti-SPN blot (Fig. 7D). K562-shSPN showed a tiny amount of SPN protein. Exogenous SPN, which was Myc-tagged, could be detected using an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 7E) and corresponded to the upper band. Both SPN proteins were recognized by Siglec-7 (Fig. 7F). To understand the involvement of Siglec-7 in the cytotoxicity of NK cells, we used Siglec-7-overexpressed (NK-Sig7) and empty vector-containing NK92-MI cells (NK-EV) (25Huang C.H. Liao Y.J. Fan T.H. Chiou T.J. Lin Y.H. Twu Y.C. A developed NK-92MI cell line with Siglec-7neg phenotype exhibits high and sustainable cytotoxicity against leukemia cells.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19: 1073Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). First, we analyzed the surface of the NK cells and confirmed cell surface expression of Siglec-7 (Fig. 8A) on NK-Sig7 cells compared with that on NK-EV as a negative control. Both NK-EV and NK-Sig7 cells expressed similar levels of SNP on the cell surface (Fig. 8B). When we analyzed Siglec-7 or Siglec-9 binding to the NK cells, we found that the ligands of Siglec-7 and Siglec-9 were present at low levels in NK-EV and NK-Sig7 cells (Fig. 8, C and D). When we added diSia-Dex to the NK cells, the binding was almost the same as with Dex (Fig. 8, E and F), indicating that, in both cases, NK cells showed no diSia-Dex binding and that Siglec-7 on NK cells was completely masked. After treating the NK cells with sialidase, binding was observed only when using diSia-Dex for NK-Sig7 cells (Fig. 8, E and F), indicating that the cis-ligands for Siglec-7 can be released by sialidase treatment but not effectively. Finally, using K562-SPN or K562-shSPN, we analyzed the influence of Siglec-7 binding to SPN on NK cell cytotoxicity toward K562 cells. As shown in Figure 9A, there was a clear relationship between the expression level of SPN and the cytotoxicity of NK cells. The cytotoxicity of NK-EV and NK-Sig7 cells toward K562-mock cells or K562-shSPN cells was similar (Fig. 9B). In contrast, the cytotoxicity of NK-Sig7 was significantly inhibited compared with that of NK-EV toward K562-SPN cells. To confirm the involvement of the diSia epitope on the function of NK cells, we used diSia-Dex as an inhibitor of Siglec-7 to regulate cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 9C, significant inhibition was observed using NK-Sig7 cells as effector cells, and this effect was not observed using NK-EV. DiSia-Dex bound Siglec-7 on NK-Sig7 and suppressed NK cell cytotoxicity, regardless of whether the target cells expressed SPN at a high level, indicating that SPN on K562 and diSia-Dex independently inhibited the cytotoxicity of NK cells via Siglec-7. NK cells are innate immune cells involved in the elimination of host cells infected by viruses and cancer cells. During NK cell surveillance, the balance of signals from activating and inhibitory receptors is thought to determine the NK cell decision to attack “unhealthy” cells. Siglec-7 is well known as an inhibitory lectin-type receptor on NK cells and is involved in inhibition of cytotoxicity toward cancer cells via Sia-containing ligands, such as GD3 or DSGb5 (10Nicoll G. Avril T. Lock K. Furukawa K. Bovin N. Crocker P. Ganglioside GD3 expression on target cells can modulate NK cell cytotoxicity via siglec-7-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Eur. J.

In this study, the K562 cell line (a human chronic myeloid leukemia carcinoma cell line), frequently used as a target cell in NK cytotoxicity assays (10Nicoll G. Avril T. Lock K. Furukawa K. Bovin N.

It has been reported that NK cells, in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against Siglec-7, enhanced cancer immunity (5Hudak J.E. Canham S.M. Bertozzi C.R.

We first identified leukosialin (SPN) as a counter-receptor on K562 cells by MS analysis and specific antibodies. To date, the known natural trans-ligands for Siglec-7 are gangliosides such as GD3 and DSGb5. However, using the PL method with K562 cells showed the ligand to be a glycoprotein. We also analyzed the possibility of a ganglioside ligand on K562 cells; however, there were almost no diSia-containing gangliosides, and Siglec-7 binding to GM3 was very faint (20Yoshimura A.

https://openalex.org/W3133647860,"Background The purpose of the present study was to identify smartphone use patterns associated with problematic smartphone use (PSU) among preschool children. Little is known about PSU patterns in younger children, although the age for first smartphone use is decreasing. Methods We applied a cross-sectional study design to analyze data obtained from a nationwide survey on smartphone overdependence conducted in 2017 by the South Korean Ministry of Science and ICT and the National Information Society Agency. Data from 1,378 preschool children were analyzed using binomial logistic regression analysis. This study was conducted in compliance with STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology). Results Seventeen percent of the sample met the criteria for PSU. The odds of PSU significantly increased with frequent smartphone use and in children who used a smartphone for more than two hours per day. Using smartphones to watch TV shows or videos for entertainment or fun significantly increased the odds of PSU, whereas using smartphones for education, games, and social networking did not. Conclusions The findings indicate that one of five preschool children using smartphones could experience PSU. Compared to other age groups, PSU in young children may be more associated with their caregivers. To prevent PSU in preschool children, caregivers need information about the total screen time recommended for children, smartphone use patterns associated with PSU, suggestions for other activities as possible alternatives to smartphone use, and strategies to strengthen children’s self-regulation with regards to smartphone use."
https://openalex.org/W3133945466,"Iron (Fe) toxicity is a major abiotic stress which severely reduces rice yield in many countries of the world. Genetic variation for this stress tolerance exists in rice germplasms. Mapping of gene(s)/QTL controlling the stress tolerance and transfer of the traits into high yielding rice varieties are essential for improvement against the stress. A panel population of 119 genotypes from 352 germplasm lines was constituted for detecting the candidate gene(s)/QTL through association mapping. STRUCTURE, GenAlEx and Darwin softwares were used to classify the population. The marker-trait association was detected by considering both the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Mixed Linear Model (MLM) analyses. Wide genetic variation was observed among the genotypes present in the panel population for the stress tolerance. Linkage disequilibrium was detected in the population for iron toxicity tolerance. The population was categorized into three genetic structure groups. Marker-trait association study considering both the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Mixed Linear Model (MLM) showed significant association of leaf browning index (LBI) with markers RM471, RM3, RM590 and RM243. Three novel QTL controlling Fe-toxicity tolerance were detected and designated as qFeTox4 . 3 , qFeTox6 . 1 and qFeTox10 . 1 . A QTL reported earlier in the marker interval of C955-C885 on chromosome 1 is validated using this panel population. The present study showed that QTL controlling Fe-toxicity tolerance to be co-localized with the QTL for Fe-biofortification of rice grain indicating involvement of common pathway for Fe toxicity tolerance and Fe content in rice grain. Fe-toxicity tolerance QTL qFeTox6 . 1 was co-localized with grain Fe-biofortification QTLs qFe6 . 1 and qFe6 . 2 on chromosome 6, whereas qFeTox10 . 1 was co-localized with qFe10 . 1 on chromosome 10. The Fe-toxicity tolerance QTL detected from this mapping study will be useful in marker-assisted breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3130481666,"TRAF3 has diverse signaling functions, which vary by cell type. Uniquely in B lymphocytes, TRAF3 inhibits homeostatic survival. Highlighting the role of TRAF3 as a tumor suppressor, loss-of-function TRAF3 mutations are associated with human B-cell malignancies, while B-cell-specific deletion of TRAF3 in mice leads to autoimmunity and lymphoma development. The role of TRAF3 in inhibiting noncanonical NF-κB activation, CD40 and BAFF-R signaling to B cells is well documented. In contrast, TRAF3 enhances many T-cell effector functions, through associating with and enhancing signaling by the T-cell receptor (TCR)-CD28 complex. The present study was designed to determine the role of TRAF3 in signaling via the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR). The BCR is crucial for antigen recognition, survival, proliferation, and antibody production, and defects in BCR signaling can promote abnormal survival of malignant B cells. Here, we show that TRAF3 is associated with both CD79B and the BCR-activated kinases Syk and Btk following BCR stimulation. BCR-induced phosphorylation of Syk and additional downstream kinases was increased in TRAF3-/- B cells, with regulation observed in both follicular and marginal zone B-cell subsets. BCR stimulation of TRAF3-/- B cells resulted in increased surface expression of MHC-II, CD80, and CD86 molecules. Interestingly, increased survival of TRAF3-/- primary B cells was resistant to inhibition of Btk, while TRAF3-deficient malignant B-cell lines showed enhanced sensitivity. TRAF3 serves to restrain normal and malignant BCR signaling, with important implications for its role in normal B-cell biology and abnormal survival of malignant B cells."
https://openalex.org/W3133201734,"Heterotrimeric G protein subunits Gαq and Gα11 are inhibited by two cyclic depsipeptides, FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM), both of which are being used widely to implicate Gq/11 proteins in the regulation of diverse biological processes. An emerging major research question therefore is whether the cellular effects of both inhibitors are on-target, that is, mediated via specific inhibition of Gq/11 proteins, or off-target, that is, the result of nonspecific interactions with other proteins. Here we introduce a versatile experimental strategy to discriminate between these possibilities. We developed a Gαq variant with preserved catalytic activity, but refractory to FR/YM inhibition. A minimum of two amino acid changes were required and sufficient to achieve complete inhibitor resistance. We characterized the novel mutant in HEK293 cells depleted by CRISPR–Cas9 of endogenous Gαq and Gα11 to ensure precise control over the Gα-dependent cellular signaling route. Using a battery of cellular outcomes with known and concealed Gq contribution, we found that FR/YM specifically inhibited cellular signals after Gαq introduction via transient transfection. Conversely, both inhibitors were inert across all assays in cells expressing the drug-resistant variant. These findings eliminate the possibility that inhibition of non-Gq proteins contributes to the cellular effects of the two depsipeptides. We conclude that combined application of FR or YM along with the drug-resistant Gαq variant is a powerful in vitro strategy to discern on-target Gq against off-target non-Gq action. Consequently, it should be of high value for uncovering Gq input to complex biological processes with high accuracy and the requisite specificity.

G proteins mainly relay chemical and physical information from GPCRs to the cell interior to regulate numerous intracellular responses. In this manner, the GPCR–G protein–signaling cascade contributes to an amazing repertoire of physiological and pathophysiological events that are relevant for the regulation of blood pressure, cell proliferation, and metabolism, among many other vital functions (7Wettschureck N.

Chem. 2019; 294: 5747-5758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), two recent investigations have cast doubt on the selectivity profiles of both inhibitors. Although one study claimed FR to also inhibit Gβγ-mediated Ca2+ signaling downstream of Gi-coupled GPCRs (64Gao Z.-G. Jacobson K.A. On the selectivity of the Gαq inhibitor UBO-QIC: A comparison with the Gαi inhibitor pertussis toxin.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2016; 107: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a recent report suggested YM to act as a broad-spectrum inhibitor for Gq and Gs proteins, and, additionally, as biased Gi inhibitor (65Peng Q. Alqahtani S. Nasrullah M.Z.A. Shen J. Functional evidence for biased inhibition of G protein signaling by YM-254890 in human coronary artery endothelial cells.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2020; 891: 173706Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, an important emerging research question is, whether FR and YM exert such nonselective effects by directly inhibiting G proteins other than Gq, G11, and G14 or by inhibiting only its canonical targets in signaling networks that cooperate with other G protein classes to control a given effector system. The latter possibility is suggested by a large body of experimental evidence showing that GPCRs interact with multiple G proteins to cooperatively regulate downstream effectors. For example, certain AC isoforms are activated synergistically by Gαs and Ca2+ evoked by Gq/11, whereas others are activated by Gαs and Gβγ released from Gi/o heterotrimers (66Cooper D.M.F.

https://openalex.org/W3134049847,"Introduction The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) has overwhelmed the health systems of several countries, particularly those within the African region. Notwithstanding, the relationship between health systems and the magnitude of COVID-19 in African countries have not received research attention. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the pervasiveness of the pandemic across African countries and their Global Health Security Index (GHSI) scores. Materials and methods The study included 54 countries in five regions viz Western (16); Eastern (18); Middle (8); Northern (7); and Southern (5) Africa. The outcome variables in this study were the total confirmed COVID-19 cases (per million); total recoveries (per million); and the total deaths (per million). The data were subjected to Spearman’s rank-order (Spearman’s rho) correlation to determine the monotonic relationship between each of the predictor variables and the outcome variables. The predictor variables that showed a monotonic relationship with the outcome were used to predict respective outcome variables using multiple regressions. The statistical analysis was conducted at a significance level of 0.05. Results Our results indicate that total number of COVID-19 cases (per million) has strong correlations ( r s &gt;0.5) with the median age; aged 65 older; aged 70 older; GDP per capita; number of hospital beds per thousand; Human Development Index (HDI); recoveries (per million); and the overall risk environment of a country. All these factors including the country’s commitments to improving national capacity were related to the total number of deaths (per million). Also, strong correlations existed between the total recoveries (per million) and the total number of positive cases; total deaths (per million); median age; aged 70 older; GDP per capita; the number of hospital beds (per thousand); and HDI. The fitted regression models showed strong predictive powers (R-squared&gt;99%) of the variances in the total number of COVID-19 cases (per million); total number of deaths (per million); and the total recoveries (per million). Conclusions The findings from this study suggest that patient-level characteristics such as ageing population (i.e., 65 + ), poverty, underlying co-morbidities–cardiovascular disease (e.g., hypertension), and diabetes through unhealthy behaviours like smoking as well as hospital care (i.e., beds per thousand) can help explain COVID-19 confirmed cases and mortality rates in Africa. Aside from these, other determinants (e.g., population density, the ability of detection, prevention and control) also affect COVID-19 prevalence, deaths and recoveries within African countries and sub-regions."

However, ORs are also found in other non-nasal tissues, but the role of these ectopic ORs in cell signaling, proliferation, and survival is not well understood. Here, using an inducible expression system in the lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cell line, we investigated two ectopic ORs, OR51E1 and OR51E2, which have been shown to be upregulated in prostate cancer. We found that, consistent with previous studies, OR51E1 stimulated adenylyl cyclase in response to treatment by short-chain to medium-chain organic acids (C3–C9) but not by acetate. OR51E2 responded to acetate and propionate but not to the longer chain organic acids. Stimulation of LNCaP cells with butyrate inhibited their growth, and the knockdown of the endogenous OR51E1 negated this cytostatic effect. Most significantly, overexpression of OR51E1 or OR51E2 suppressed LNCaP cell proliferation. Overexpression of another ectopic OR OR2AT4, β2-adrenergic receptor, or treatment of cells with forskolin did not suppress cell proliferation, indicating that a rise in cAMP is not sufficient to induce cytostasis. Overexpression of OR51E1 caused an upregulation of cytostatic and cell death markers including p27, p21, and p53, strongly increased annexin V staining, and stimulated extracellular signal–regulated protein kinases 1 and 2. Overexpression and/or activation of OR51E1 did not affect human embryonic kidney 293 cell proliferation, indicating that cytotoxicity of OR51E1/OR51E2 is specific for LNCaP cells. Together, our results further our understanding of prostate cancer etiology and suggest that ectopic ORs may be useful therapeutic targets.

G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are responsible for the detection of a variety of extracellular stimuli that range from small molecules such as biogenic amines and metabolites to proteins. GPCR signaling regulates rapid cellular responses involving cAMP, Ca2+, phosphorylation, and long-term processes such as gene expression and cell growth. GPCRs are the largest family of human genes (∼800), and within GPCRs, the largest subclass is olfactory receptors (ORs): there are more than 380 ORs in human genome (1Niimura Y. Evolutionary dynamics of olfactory receptor genes in chordates: Interaction between environments and genomic contents.Hum. Genomics. 2009; 4: 107-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nomenclature describing ORs is independent between the species. Human receptors are called ORs (olfactory receptors) and classified with numbers and letters, e.g., OR51E1, which is one of the receptors we are investigating in this article. The ∼1000 mouse ORs are abbreviated as Olfr; Olfr558 is the ortholog of OR51E1 (2Glusman G. Yanai I. Rubin I. Lancet D.

A novel multigene family may encode odorant receptors: A molecular basis for odor recognition.Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3495) Google Scholar), but several years ago, expression of specific OR genes was detected in the airways, gut, blood vessels, brain, and other organs in rodents and human tissues and cell lines (2Glusman G.

Renal Physiol. 2019; 316: F372-F381Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is obvious that ectopic ORs do not take part in the perception of smell. Understanding of their function has lagged behind that of other GPCRs, and the majority of ORs remain to be orphan receptors (7Foster S.R. Roura E. Thomas W.G. Extrasensory perception: Odorant and taste receptors beyond the nose and mouth.Pharmacol. Ther. 2014; 142: 41-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 11Saito H. Chi Q. Zhuang H. Matsunami H. Mainland J.D. Odor coding by a mammalian receptor repertoire.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2ra9Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). One reason for this delay is that the expression of functionally active ORs and Olfrs has not been technically possible for many years. Most GPCRs can be produced in a functionally active state in vitro using standard methods such as transient transfection of model cell lines. ORs, however, require the presence of special chaperones and/or modification with signal peptides and other sequences for receptor stability and trafficking to the surface (12Saito H. Kubota M.

These discoveries facilitated expression of ORs in specially engineered cell lines via transient transfection, thereby allowing investigation of their function. It was shown that ORs and Olfrs activate Gs and increase intracellular cAMP. However, it still has not been established if ORs can signal only through Gs or, like many nonolfactory GPCRs, can also activate other G proteins and/or other signal transduction pathways. Regardless, the ability of ORs to increase the cAMP level has been used for their deorphanization. These efforts have primarily been focused on finding ligands relevant to the sense of smell, and therefore, the currently established OR ligands are small volatile chemicals (11Saito H. Chi Q. Zhuang H. Matsunami H. Mainland J.D. Odor coding by a mammalian receptor repertoire.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2ra9Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In this article, we investigate the function of two ORs, OR51E1 and OR51E2. They have been detected in several tissues and, as discussed later, are particularly interesting because of their association with prostate cancer. OR51E1 and OR51E2 are ∼60% identical and have orthologs in mice. OR51E1 is ∼95% identical to Olfr558, and OR51E2 is ∼93% identical to Olfr78. ORs are poorly conserved between species (15Adipietro K.A. Mainland J.D. Matsunami H. Functional evolution of mammalian odorant receptors.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8e1002821Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and such high degree of conservancy is rare even for the GPCR family at large, which indicates that OR51E1 and Olfr558 play an essential physiological role. Deorphanization efforts showed that Olfr558 and Olfr78 can be activated by butyric and propionic acids, respectively (11Saito H. Chi Q. Zhuang H. Matsunami H. Mainland J.D.

Studies in mice have shown that the Olfr78 gene is expressed in blood vessels of the kidney, where this receptor can regulate blood pressure in response to propionic acid produced by gut microbiota (16Pluznick J.L.

The human ortholog OR51E1 is also activated by butyrate and other aliphatic acids (18Halperin Kuhns V.L. Sanchez J. Sarver D.C. Khalil Z. Rajkumar P. Marr K.A. Pluznick J.L.

Such controversies in the OR field are not uncommon and are likely to be caused by the technical difficulties with detection and functional analysis of both endogenous and overexpressed ORs. It has been established that the level of the OR51E1 and OR51E2 gene expression increases more than 10-fold in prostate cancer (24Wang J. Weng J. Cai Y. Penland R. Liu M. Ittmann M.

Because of their association with prostate cancer, OR51E1 and OR51E2 have been referred to as prostate-specific GPCRs (PSGR2 and PSGR, respectively) (25Xu L.L. Stackhouse B.G. Florence K. Zhang W.

Changes in the expression level of OR51E2/PSGR in mouse models have been associated with activation of NF-κB and protein kinases (28Rodriguez M. Luo W. Weng J. Zeng L. Yi Z. Siwko S. Liu M. PSGR promotes prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer xenograft growth through NF-kappaB.Oncogenesis. 2014; 3e114Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here, we studied OR51E1 and OR51E2 in the human metastatic prostate cell line lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) using a novel expression system that allows robust detection and functional analysis of ORs. We show that activation of the endogenous OR51E1 and OR51E2 by their aliphatic acid agonists inhibits cell proliferation. Surprisingly, we discovered that overexpression of these ORs possesses not only the robust cytostatic effect but also causes cell death. Our data show that these effects are selective for OR51E1 and OR51E2 and provide initial insights into the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. OR51E1 and OR51E2 are endogenously expressed in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (Fig. 1A; (19Abaffy T. Bain J.R. Muehlbauer M.J. Spasojevic I. Lodha S. Bruguera E. O'Neal S.K. Kim S.Y.

One of our goals was to study long-term effects of the OR51E1 upregulation, and for that purpose, we sought generation of a stable cell line. During our initial attempts, we found that none of the puromycin-resistant clones expressed the full-length receptor. We reasoned that high levels of OR51E1 were toxic to the cells, resulting in the selection of only the clones where its expression was suppressed. To circumvent this problem, we utilized an inducible system based on tetracycline promoter and augmented the OR51E1 complementary DNA (cDNA) with sequences facilitating OR expression (13Shepard B.D. Natarajan N. Protzko R.J. Acres O.W. Pluznick J.L. A cleavable N-terminal signal peptide promotes widespread olfactory receptor surface expression in HEK293T cells.PLoS One. 2013; 8e68758Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the FLAG tag for detection (Fig. 1, B–F); we similarly modified the cDNAs of other GPCRs that we used in our experiments. The selected puromycin-resistant cells had no detectable FLAG immunoreactivity prior to induction with doxycycline, showing the absence of significant leaking of the tetracycline promoter (Figs. 1, B and D and 2, A and B). Within several hours after induction, the cells produced the OR51E1 or OR51E2 proteins of the predicted ∼40 kDa molecular weight, and as expected for glycosylated proteins such as GPCRs, the bands were fuzzy (Figs. 1 and 2). Indeed, a treatment with deglycosylation enzymes caused the main OR51E1 band to shift down to ∼32 kDa, and the band also became sharper (Fig. 1C). About 20% of FLAG immunoreactivity was also detected in the area of ∼70 kDa, which corresponds to the GPCR dimers, also a general characteristic of GPCR behavior on SDS-PAGE. Noteworthy, the commercial antibody against OR51E1, which we tested, did not detect any specific protein band in cells overexpressing the recombinant OR51E1 (Fig. 1F); this is not surprising given the notorious lack of activity of commercial anti-GPCR antibodies (31Marchalant Y. Brownjohn P.W. Bonnet A. Kleffmann T. Ashton J.C. Validating antibodies to the cannabinoid CB2 receptor: Antibody sensitivity is not evidence of antibody specificity.J. Histochem.

Visualization and quantification of GPCR trafficking in mammalian cells by confocal microscopy.Methods Cell Biol. 2017; 142: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). According to immunofluorescence microscopy with the anti-FLAG antibody, overexpressed OR51E1 was present on the cell surface indicating effective trafficking to the plasma membrane (Fig. 1G). To test the functional activity of recombinant ORs, we assayed cAMP using two independent methods: indirect, by detecting PKA-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 2) and direct, using a novel fluorescence-based real-time cAMP biosensor (34Tewson P.H. Martinka S. Shaner N.C. Hughes T.E. Quinn A.M. New DAG and cAMP sensors optimized for live-cell assays in automated laboratories.J. Biomol.

Assay for detecting Galphai-mediated decreases in cAMP in living cells.SLAS Discov. 2018; 23: 898-906PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The PKA activity was assessed using the antibody against the phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the phosphorylation consensus motif of PKA substrates RxxS∗/T∗ (Fig. 2). This antibody revealed OR51E1-dependent phosphorylation of an 82 kDa protein. The identity of this protein is unknown, but it was also phosphorylated upon stimulation of LNCaP cells with forskolin (Fig. 2A), indicating that this phosphorylation occurs via the cAMP pathway. Phosphorylation of the p82 kDa protein depended on the OR identity and the nature of the stimulants. For example, OR51E1 was stimulated by valeric and nonanoic acids, whereas OR51E2 was not. Instead, OR51E2 was stimulated by acetate and propionate; OR51E1 was insensitive to acetate, and its response to propionate was weaker than to the longer aliphatic acids (Fig. 2, C and D). As a control in our studies, we also expressed a different OR, OR2AT4; it had the expected apparent molecular weight and an expression level similar to OR51E1 and OR51E2. OR2AT4 was not activated by either propionic or butyric acids; however, it did not respond to its purported agonist, Sandalore (37Busse D. Kudella P. Gruning N.M. Gisselmann G. Stander S. Luger T. Jacobsen F. Steinstrasser L. Paus R. Gkogkolou P. Bohm M. Hatt H. Benecke H. A synthetic sandalwood odorant induces wound-healing processes in human keratinocytes via the olfactory receptor OR2AT4.J.

Olfactory receptor OR2AT4 regulates human hair growth.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) either (Fig. 2B). We also did not detect phosphorylation of p82 in OR51E1- and OR51E2-expressing cells upon stimulation with β-ionone (Fig. 2, C and D). Direct measurement of cAMP using the fluorescent biosensor showed a rapid and reversible cAMP rise upon application of butyrate in the cells expressing OR51E1. Such response did not occur in control LNCaP cells or the cells expressing OR51E2 (Fig. 3A). Under the same conditions, cAMP was not increased upon stimulation of OR51E1- or OR2AT4-expressing cells with Sandalore (Fig. 3B). Since some investigations implicated ORs in stimulation of free Ca2+ fluxes (21Gelis L. Jovancevic N. Veitinger S. Mandal B. Arndt H.D. Neuhaus E.M. Hatt H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 16218-16225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we tested if in addition to cAMP, activation of ORs could influence Ca2+ in our system (Fig. 3, C and D). We used our LNCaP cell lines expressing OR51E1 and OR2AT4, the OR that was previously reported to elicit Ca2+ responses (37Busse D. Kudella P. Gruning N.M. Gisselmann G. Stander S. Luger T. Jacobsen F. Steinstrasser L. Paus R. Gkogkolou P. Bohm M. Hatt H. Benecke H. A synthetic sandalwood odorant induces wound-healing processes in human keratinocytes via the olfactory receptor OR2AT4.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2014; 134: 2823-2832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We also generated human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines expressing these two ORs and used the prototypical Gq-coupled GPCR M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (M3R) as a positive control. OR51E1 expressed in HEK293 cells responded to butyrate and some other related compounds, as evident from our PKA assay (Fig. 3D), indicating the receptor was functionally active. As expected, stimulation of M3R by its agonist oxotremorine M caused robust Ca2+ responses (Fig. 3E). Butyrate, valerate, or Sandalore did not influence Ca2+ in cells overexpressing either M3R, OR2AT4, or OR51E1 (Fig. 3F). Our data from the real-time biosensor and PKA phosphorylation assays were consistent with our measurements of cAMP using the PerkinElmer TR-FRET kit (PerkinElmer), which we will report elsewhere. Here, to further characterize agonist specificity of OR51E1, we tested 15 structurally related compounds for their ability to elevate cAMP via OR51E1 and found that eight of them activated the receptor and seven did not (Fig. 4). Overall, our results on activation of OR51E1 by aliphatic acids but not structurally similar compounds (Fig. 4) were consistent with those earlier studies where the OR expression at the protein level was convincingly demonstrated (11Saito H. Chi Q. Zhuang H. Matsunami H. Mainland J.D. Odor coding by a mammalian receptor repertoire.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2ra9Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 18Halperin Kuhns V.L. Sanchez J.

Renal Physiol. 2019; 317: F172-F186Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Having established the functional activity of the overexpressed OR51E1 and OR51E2, we focused on their cancer-related properties, i.e., effects on cell growth and survival. Incubation of control LNCaP cells with 0.3 mM propionate or 0.1 mM butyrate caused a considerable reduction of their growth rate. These results were consistent with the earlier report by Hatt et al. (30Massberg D. Jovancevic N. Offermann A. Simon A. Baniahmad A. Perner S. Pungsrinont T. Luko K. Philippou S. Ubrig B. Heiland M. Weber L. Altmuller J. Becker C. Gisselmann G. et al.The activation of OR51E1 causes growth suppression of human prostate cancer cells.Oncotarget. 2016; 7: 48231-48249Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that treatment of LNCaP cells with OR51E1 agonist nonanoic acid induced cell senescence. We also found that when butyrate and propionate were added together, the cytostatic effect became stronger (Fig. 5A). It is not yet clear whether OR51E1 and OR51E2 activate the same cytostatic mechanism or engage distinct pathways. Importantly, we found almost no effect of these aliphatic acids on another prostate cancer cell line, DU145, which does not express OR51E1 and OR51E2 genes (Fig. 1A). The combination of butyrate and propionate had a statistically significant inhibitory effect on the growth of DU145 cells. This can be explained by the presence of other receptors or other mechanisms activated by the high concentrations of these aliphatic acids. In LNCaP cells, the involvement of OR51E1 in suppression of cell proliferation was shown by the shRNA-mediated knockdown of OR51E1 in LNCaP, which eliminated the cytostatic effect of butyrate (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, using our methods, we were unable to detect butyrate-mediated upregulation of cAMP stimulation of control LNCaP cells (Figs. 2A and 3A). Evidently, a detectable rise in cAMP requires a higher level of the receptor. To facilitate the studies of overexpressed ORs on cell proliferation, we used the Incucyte (Sartorius) instrument (Fig. 6). This is a robotic microscope that can take images of cells duri"

We aimed to evaluate the underlying association and risk factors of DIP and IPD. Methods A retrospective cohort study using National Health Insurance Claims data in 2011–2016 was conducted. New-onset DIP patients in 2012 were selected and matched with active controls having diabetes mellitus at a 1:4 ratio by age, sex, and Charlson’s Comorbidity Index score. Comorbidity, causative drugs, and prescription days were evaluated as covariates. Results A total of 441 DIP were selected. During the 4-year follow up, 14 IPD events in the DM group but 62 events in the DIP group were observed (adjusted hazard ratio, HR: 18.88, 95% CI, 9.09–39.22, adjusting for comorbidities and causative drugs). IPD diagnosis in DIP was observed high in males compared to females (15.58/13.24%). The event was the most within the 1 st year follow-up, mean days 453 (SD 413.36). Subgroup analysis in DIP showed calcium channel blocker (verapamil, diltiazem, and flunarizine) was significantly associated with increased IPD risk (HR: 2.24, 95% CI, 1.27–3.93). Conclusion Increased IPD in DIP patients might not be from the causal toxicity of antidopaminergic effects but from a trigger by the causative drugs on the DIP patients who already had subclinical IPD pathology. DIP can serve as a strong proxy for IPD incidence. Subjects who develop DIP should be monitored carefully for potential IPD incidence."
https://openalex.org/W3134021194,"Mediterranean diet (MD) is among the most commonly investigated diets and recognized as one of the healthiest dietary patterns. Due to its complexity, geographical and cultural variations, it also represents a challenge for quantification. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess reliability and validity of the Croatian version of the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Serving Score (MDSS), using the Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as the referent test. We included the exploratory sample of 360 medical students, and a confirmatory sample of 299 health studies students from the University of Split, Croatia. Test-retest reliability and validity of the MDSS were tested using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), while Cohen’s kappa statistic was used to test correct classification of subjects into MD adherent/non-adherent category. A very good reliability was shown for the overall MDSS score (ICC = 0.881 [95% CI 0.843–0.909]), and a moderate reliability for the binary adherence (κ = 0.584). Concurrent validity of the MDSS was also better when expressed as a total score (ICC = 0.544 [0.439–0.629]) as opposed to the adherence (κ = 0.223), with similar result in the confirmatory sample (ICC = 0.510 [0.384–0.610]; κ = 0.216). Disappointingly, only 13.6% of medical students were adherent to the MD according to MDSS, and 19.7% according to the MEDAS questionnaire. Nevertheless, MDSS score was positively correlated with age (ρ = 0.179: P = 0.003), self-assessed health perception (ρ = 0.123; P = 0.047), and mental well-being (ρ = 0.139: P = 0.022). MDSS questionnaire is a short, reliable and reasonably valid instrument, and thus useful for assessing the MD adherence, with better results when used as a numeric score, even in the population with low MD adherence."

However, we understand very little about the normal functions of fission or how fission disruption may interact with AD-associated proteins to modulate pathogenesis. Here we show that loss of the central mitochondrial fission protein dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) in CA1 and other forebrain neurons markedly worsens the learning and memory of mice expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP) in neurons. In cultured neurons, Drp1KO and hAPP converge to produce mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitoCa2+) overload, despite decreasing mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs) and cytosolic Ca2+. This mitoCa2+ overload occurs independently of ATP levels. These findings reveal a potential mechanism by which mitochondrial fission protects against hAPP-driven pathology.

Although it remains unclear whether increased fragmentation actually causes neurodegeneration, inhibiting Drp1 can protect against toxicity in models of Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease (7Wang W.

Importantly, disrupting the fission–fusion balance in either direction can be toxic, since insufficient mitochondrial fission produces excessive mitochondrial tubulation and also causes disease (1Itoh K.

A lethal defect of mitochondrial and peroxisomal fission.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356: 1736-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In addition, Drp1 has been shown to lie downstream of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which functions to stabilize microtubules and actin, and also accumulates in intracellular aggregates in AD (17Fulga T.A. Elson-Schwab I. Khurana V. Steinhilb M.L. Spires T.L. Hyman B.T. Feany M.B. Abnormal bundling and accumulation of F-actin mediates tau-induced neuronal degeneration in vivo.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Tau regulates Drp1 through effects on stabilizing actin (18Duboff B. Gotz J. Feany M.B. Tau promotes neurodegeneration via DRP1 Mislocalization in vivo.Neuron. 2012; 75: 618-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and tau can cause toxicity by blocking Drp1 localization to mitochondria (18Duboff B. Gotz J. Feany M.B. Tau promotes neurodegeneration via DRP1 Mislocalization in vivo.Neuron. 2012; 75: 618-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of Drp1 in AD pathogenesis still remains unclear and may be context-dependent. The functions of mitochondrial fission in healthy neurons also remain poorly understood, but appear to be multifactorial. Neurons require Drp1 to target mitochondria down distal axons (19Verstreken P. Ly C.V. Venken K.J. Koh T.W. Zhou Y. Bellen H.J.

Neurosci. Off. J. Soc. Neurosci. 2014; 34: 14304-14317Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition, neurons lacking Drp1 are unable to maintain normal levels of mitochondrial-derived ATP at the nerve terminal (21Shields L.Y. Kim H. Zhu L. Haddad D. Berthet A. Pathak D. Lam M.

Dynamin-related protein 1 is required for normal mitochondrial bioenergetic and synaptic function in CA1 hippocampal neurons.Cell Death Dis. 2015; 6: e1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), at least in part due to intrinsic functional deficits in mitochondria lacking Drp1. Drp1 is also critical for respiration in other cells with high energy requirements such as cardiac myocytes (22Kageyama Y. Hoshijima M. Seo K. Bedja D. Sysa-Shah P. Andrabi S.A. Chen W. Hoke A.

Res. 2015; 117: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Fission is also widely hypothesized to support mitochondrial function by facilitating the turnover of dysfunctional mitochondria (29Twig G. Elorza A. Molina A.J. Mohamed H. Wikstrom J.D. Walzer G. Stiles L. Haigh S.E. Katz S. Las G. Alroy J. Wu M. Py B.F. Yuan J. Deeney J.T. et al.Fission and selective fusion govern mitochondrial segregation and elimination by autophagy.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 433-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Without fission, mitochondria may be too large to be engulfed by autophagosomes, causing dysfunctional mitochondria to accumulate (21Shields L.Y. Kim H. Zhu L. Haddad D. Berthet A. Pathak D. Lam M. Ponnusamy R. Diaz-Ramirez L.G. Gill T.M. Sesaki H. Mucke L. Nakamura K.

Cell Biol. 2009; 186: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, mitochondrial fission may also support mitochondrial function more directly. For instance, mitochondrial fission by Drp1 occurs at the points of contact between mitochondria and the ER (mitochondria-associated membranes, MAMs (30Friedman J.R. Lackner L.L. West M. DiBenedetto J.R. Nunnari J. Voeltz G.K. ER tubules mark sites of mitochondrial division.Science. 2011; 334: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar)), raising the possibility that Drp1 influences MAM function and thus Ca2+ and lipid metabolism. Interestingly, cytosolic calcium (cytCa2+) promotes Drp1 recruitment to mitochondria through calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1 alpha (31Cereghetti G.M. Stangherlin A. Martins de Brito O. Chang C.R. Blackstone C. Bernardi P. Scorrano L. Dephosphorylation by calcineurin regulates translocation of Drp1 to mitochondria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

CaM kinase I alpha-induced phosphorylation of Drp1 regulates mitochondrial morphology.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), although it remains unclear how Drp1 ultimately impacts calcium homeostasis and whether any such effects are independent of its role in supporting ATP levels in neurons (21Shields L.Y. Kim H. Zhu L. Haddad D. Berthet A. Pathak D. Lam M. Ponnusamy R. Diaz-Ramirez L.G. Gill T.M. Sesaki H. Mucke L. Nakamura K. Dynamin-related protein 1 is required for normal mitochondrial bioenergetic and synaptic function in CA1 hippocampal neurons.Cell Death Dis. 2015; 6: e1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Indeed, Ca2+ buffering may be particularly energetically expensive (33Surmeier D.J. Schumacker P.T. Calcium, bioenergetics, and neuronal vulnerability in Parkinson's disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 10736-10741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and hence insufficient ATP might compromise the capacity of neurons to maintain normal cytosolic Ca2+ levels and gradients. In order to better understand the functions of mitochondrial fission and how altered fission may influence the pathophysiology of AD, we examined the impact of loss of mitochondrial fission on the toxicity of mutant hAPP in mouse neurons. Increased mitochondrial fission has been proposed to underlie Aβ toxicity (34Cho D.H. Nakamura T. Fang J. Cieplak P. Godzik A. Gu Z. Lipton S.A. S-nitrosylation of Drp1 mediates beta-amyloid-related mitochondrial fission and neuronal injury.Science. 2009; 324: 102-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), and Drp1 inhibitors are protective in other mouse models of neurotoxicity (11Rappold P.M. Cui M. Grima J.C. Fan R.Z. de Mesy-Bentley K.L. Chen L. Zhuang X. Bowers W.J. Tieu K. Drp1 inhibition attenuates neurotoxicity and dopamine release deficits in vivo.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 5244Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 35Grohm J. Kim S.W. Mamrak U. Tobaben S. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. Plesnila N. Culmsee C. Inhibition of Drp1 provides neuroprotection in vitro and in vivo.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19: 1446-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To test if loss of the central mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 protects against the toxicity of mutant APP, we generated mice with targeted deletion of Drp1 on a mutant human APP background. First, Drp1lox/lox mice were crossed with an Alzheimer’s mouse model, hAPP-J20 (36Mucke L. Masliah E. Yu G.Q. Mallory M. Rockenstein E.M. Tatsuno G. Hu K. Kholodenko D. Johnson-Wood K. McConlogue L. High-level neuronal expression of abeta 1-42 in wild-type human amyloid protein precursor transgenic mice: Synaptotoxicity without plaque formation.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), referred to henceforth as hAPP, which expresses mutant hAPP (Swedish and Indiana mutations) in neurons under the PDGF-beta promoter. All hAPP mice were heterozygous carriers of the hAPP transgene. hAPP;Drp1wt/lox mice were bred to homozygosity (hAPP;Drp1lox/lox). To generate hAPP mice that lack Drp1 in CA1 and other forebrain neurons (Drp1cKO), we bred CamKCre;Drp1wt/lox and hAPP;Drp1lox/lox mice to generate hAPP;Drp1lox/lox;CamKII-Cre mice. The resulting progeny (total n = 246 mice) was born in roughly Mendelian proportions including controls that lacked Cre (Drp1wt/lox and Drp1lox/lox, 26.4%), Drp1 heterozygotes (Drp1lox/wt;CamKII-Cre,13.0%), Drp1cKO (Drp1lox/lox;CamKII-Cre, 16.7%), hAPP mice that lacked Cre (hAPP;Drp1wt/lox and hAPP;Drp1lox/lox, 20.3%), hAPP Drp1 heterozygotes 13.8%, and hAPP Drp1cKO (9.75%). As expected, hAPP mice had decreased survival (Fig. 1A) (37Roberson E.D. Scearce-Levie K. Palop J.J. Yan F. Cheng I.H. Wu T. Gerstein H. Yu G.Q. Mucke L. Reducing endogenous tau ameliorates amyloid beta-induced deficits in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.Science. 2007; 316: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). Loss of Drp1 expression did not affect the survival defect in hAPP mice, and all genotypes had similar body weights through 7 months of age (Fig. 1B). In open field tests, hAPP and hAPP Drp1cKO mice displayed increased movement in the open field (Fig. 1C), consistent with hyperactivity previously seen in hAPP mice (38Verret L. Mann E.O. Hang G.B. Barth A.M. Cobos I. Ho K. Devidze N. Masliah E. Kreitzer A.C. Mody I. Mucke L. Palop J.J. Inhibitory interneuron deficit links altered network activity and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer model.Cell. 2012; 149: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) and indicating intact motor activity, as expected for the hAPP genotype. Notably, Drp1cKO mice also exhibited hyperactivity, a finding that could indicate a network hyperactivity similar to that found in hAPP mice (38Verret L. Mann E.O. Hang G.B. Barth A.M. Cobos I. Ho K. Devidze N. Masliah E. Kreitzer A.C. Mody I. Mucke L. Palop J.J. Inhibitory interneuron deficit links altered network activity and cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer model.Cell. 2012; 149: 708-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). All genotypes exhibited similar swim speeds throughout procedural and spatial learning (Fig. 1D) and exhibited evidence of procedural learning during cued platform testing using the Morris water maze (MWM), indicating that there are no major sensorimotor deficits in any of the genotypes. Although procedural learning was attenuated in the hAPP and Drp1cKO groups, all groups except for hAPP Drp1cKO mice were equivalent in their procedural performance at the end of training (Fig. 1E). Rather than protecting against hAPP toxicity, Drp1KO markedly exacerbated the spatial learning and memory impairments of hAPP mice in the MWM. hAPP Drp1cKO mice were unable to learn the platform location despite training over 14 sessions during seven consecutive days (Fig. 1F), suggesting a functional synergism of Drp1 loss and hAPP in vivo. Drp1cKO and hAPP mice showed only subtle spatial learning deficits, based on rank order analysis of latency. No learning differences were noted with Drp1 heterozygotes (Fig. S1, A and B). Spatial learning and memory deficits of Drp1cKO and hAPP mice were confirmed during probe trial performance carried out 24 and 72 h after the last training trial. hAPP mice took significantly longer to cross over the former location of the hidden platform (target), and both Drp1cKO and hAPP mice did not cross its former location as frequently as control mice. hAPP Drp1cKO mice performed worse than mice harboring either mutation alone (Fig. 1, G and H). Therefore, complete Drp1 loss markedly worsens (rather than prevents) the adverse effects of hAPP on memory. In contrast, hAPP Drp1cHET mice had decreased latency to target at 72 h compared with hAPP mice and also crossed the former platform location more frequently than hAPP mice at 24 h. Therefore, partial Drp1 loss does not worsen spatial learning and memory and may actually protect against it (Fig. S1, C and D). To determine whether Drp1 loss increased in vivo neurotoxicity by increasing Aβ levels, we examined Aβ deposition. However, concurrent loss of Drp1 did not significantly change the extent of age-dependent Aβ plaque deposition in hAPP mice, although the sensitivity of this experiment was limited by high variability (Fig. S2, A and B). Likewise, Drp1 loss alone did not change the level of murine APP in CA1 hippocampal neurons and also did not impact the total level of APP (murine and human) in hAPP Drp1cKO mice (Fig. S2, C and D). Moreover, hAPP expression alone did not affect hippocampal and CA1 volume and also did not contribute to the age-dependent loss of hippocampal or CA1 volume evident between 6-and 12-month-old Drp1cKO mice (Fig. 2, A–C, S3, A and B) (21Shields L.Y. Kim H. Zhu L. Haddad D. Berthet A. Pathak D. Lam M. Ponnusamy R. Diaz-Ramirez L.G. Gill T.M. Sesaki H. Mucke L. Nakamura K. Dynamin-related protein 1 is required for normal mitochondrial bioenergetic and synaptic function in CA1 hippocampal neurons.Cell Death Dis. 2015; 6: e1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or affect CA1 cell density (Figs. 2D and S3C). Therefore, concurrent loss of Drp1 and hAPP did not increase the mild, age-dependent neuronal loss seen in Drp1cKO mice (21Shields L.Y. Kim H. Zhu L. Haddad D. Berthet A. Pathak D. Lam M. Ponnusamy R. Diaz-Ramirez L.G. Gill T.M. Sesaki H. Mucke L. Nakamura K. Dynamin-related protein 1 is required for normal mitochondrial bioenergetic and synaptic function in CA1 hippocampal neurons.Cell Death Dis. 2015; 6: e1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We next investigated how loss of mitochondrial fission predisposes neurons to the toxicity of hAPP. Drp1KO neurons have swollen mitochondria, and tau may cause toxicity by producing excessive mitochondrial tubulation (18Duboff B. Gotz J. Feany M.B. Tau promotes neurodegeneration via DRP1 Mislocalization in vivo.Neuron. 2012; 75: 618-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, hAPP alone had no impact on mitochondrial morphology or on Drp1 levels, nor did it affect the percent of cells with swollen mitochondria produced by Drp1cKO in vivo (Figs. 2, E and F, S4, A and B). In addition, neither hAPP nor Drp1cKO affected mitochondrial content in hippocampal neurons, as assessed by Tom20, PDH, and HSP60 immunofluorescence (Fig. 2E, and S4, C–F), indicating that a change in mitochondrial content is also unlikely to underlie the compound toxicity. Mitochondria have critical functions in Ca2+ buffering, which influences both cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ (mitoCa2+) levels (39Rizzuto R. De Stefani D. Raffaello A. Mammucari C. Mitochondria as sensors and regulators of calcium signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 566-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar, 40Kaufman R.J. Malhotra J.D. Calcium trafficking integrates endoplasmic reticulum function with mitochondrial bioenergetics.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1843: 2233-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, sufficient mitoCa2+ is required for respiratory chain enzyme function, but excessive Ca2+ can be toxic. To determine if Drp1KO and hAPP influence mitoCa2+ levels, we established a hippocampal neuron model system in which either Drp1 was deleted (Drp1KO), hAPP was overexpressed, or both. Specifically, we cotransfected Drp1lox/lox primary hippocampal neurons with hAPP (41Murrell J. Farlow M. Ghetti B. Benson M.D. A mutation in the amyloid precursor protein associated with hereditary Alzheimer's disease.Science. 1991; 254: 97-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar, 42Mullan M. Crawford F.

Genet. 1992; 1: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar) and either Cre recombinase (to remove Drp1) or a vector control, as well as Cepia3mt to measure mitoCa2+ (43Suzuki J. Kanemaru K. Ishii K. Ohkura M. Okubo Y. Iino M. Imaging intraorganellar Ca2+ at subcellular resolution using CEPIA.Nat. Commun. 2014; 5: 4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and mApple as a control to normalize for probe expression level. We confirmed hAPP expression (Fig. S5A) and that Cre expression led to the expected altered mitochondrial morphology and decreased Drp1 levels in vitro, indicative of Drp1 deletion (Figs. 2E, S4, A, B and D) (21Shields L.Y. Kim H. Zhu L. Haddad D. Berthet A. Pathak D. Lam M. Ponnusamy R. Diaz-Ramirez L.G. Gill T.M. Sesaki H. Mucke L. Nakamura K. Dynamin-related protein 1 is required for normal mitochondrial bioenergetic and synaptic function in CA1 hippocampal neurons.Cell Death Dis. 2015; 6: e1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We first examined basal levels of mitoCa2+, estimated based on the ratio of basal Cepia3mt fluorescence/mApple fluorescence and found that they were similar in all groups (Fig. S5B). Next, we examined the neuron’s capacity to buffer Ca2+ during neural activity, using electrical field stimulation (30hz for 3s), which promotes preferential release of vesicles in the readily releasable pool (44Pathak D. Shields L.Y. Mendelsohn B.A. Haddad D. Lin W. Gerencser A.A. Kim H. Brand M.D. Edwards R.H. Nakamura K. The role of mitochondrially derived ATP in synaptic vesicle recycling.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 22325-22336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A–D, S5C). Following each electrical pulse train, mitoCa2+ transiently increased and then returned to baseline in most cells from all groups (e.g., Fig. 3, A and B). However, in a subset of cells of all genotypes, mitoCa2+ levels failed to recover (i.e., return to <30% peak amplitude) within ≈17s after electrical stimulation, defined as mitoCa2+ overload (e.g., Fig. 3C). Overall, the combination hAPP-Drp1KO increased both the extent of mitoCa2+ influx (Fig. 3, D and E) and the frequency of mitoCa2+ overload (Fig. 3F), while neither hAPP nor Drp1KO alone affected these parameters. The increased mitoCa2+ influx was driven by increased mitoCa2+ influx into those cells that underwent mitoCa2+ overload, since mitoCa2+ influx was unchanged among those cells that recovered (Fig. S5, C and D). Moreover, mitoCa2+ overload may be triggered by excessive mitoCa2+ influx not decreased efflux. Consistent with this, among cells that recovered, both Drp1KO and hAPP-Drp1KO actually had a shorter half-life of mitoCa2+ decay (Fig. S5E), raising the possibility that loss of Drp1 upregulates mitoCa2+ efflux, for instance, to cope with increased import, as was observed in hAPP-Drp1KO cells. However, in hAPP-Drp1KO cells, our data suggest that increased mitoCa2+ influx eventually exceeds the capacity for m"
https://openalex.org/W3135058303,"Introduction Sympathovagal balance measured by heart rate variability is a core component of psychophysiological research. Through the close link of physiological and psychological aspects, often a reduced heart rate variability is associated with impaired cognitive function. A better understanding of the associations between cognitive and cardiovascular dysfunctions is necessary to prevent the manifestation of diseases. Therefore, this study investigated phasic heart rate variability using rest, anticipatory, stress, and recovery periods and the association with high and low cognitive performance in a generally healthy population setting. Methods 114 healthy individuals (40 males, 74 females) aged 20 to 70 participated in the cross-sectional study. The heart rate variability based on standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN), and the root means square of successive differences (RMSSD), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF) and LF/HF ratio and its association with high and low cognitive performance measured by the California Verbal Learning Task II were examined. Results The results of this study indicate that the paradigm was successful in producing stress and showed a significant association between phasic heart rate variability (SDNN) and verbal episodic memory performance, irrespective of age and sex. Discussion The results of this study suggest that a reduced heart rate variability is associated with reduced cognitive function regardless of age and sex and seem to be an early indicator of sympathovagal disbalance. Conclusion This leads to the conclusion that differences between high and low cognitive performance might show differences in heart rate variability at an early stage, where no diseases are yet manifest."

ATR signaling is stimulated by an ATR activating protein, and in metazoan cells, there are at least two ATR activators: TOPBP1 and ETAA1. Current evidence indicates TOPBP1 and ETAA1 activate ATR via the same biochemical mechanism, but several aspects of this mechanism remain undefined. For example, ATR and its obligate binding partner ATR interacting protein (ATRIP) form a tetrameric complex consisting of two ATR and two ATRIP molecules, but whether TOPBP1 or ETAA1 dimerization is similarly required for ATR function is unclear. Here, we show that fusion of the TOPBP1 and ETAA1 ATR activation domains (AADs) to dimeric tags makes them more potent activators of ATR in vitro. Furthermore, induced dimerization of both AADs using chemical dimerization of a modified FKBP tag enhances ATR kinase activation and signaling in cells. ETAA1 forms oligomeric complexes mediated by regions of the protein that are predicted to be intrinsically disordered. Induced dimerization of a “mini-ETAA1” protein that contains the AAD and Replication Protein A (RPA) interaction motifs enhances ATR signaling, rescues cellular hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents, and suppresses micronuclei formation in ETAA1-deficient cells.

Replication forks frequently encounter obstacles such as DNA damage and transcriptional machinery that impede their progression (1Cortez D. Replication-coupled DNA repair.Mol. Cell. 2019; 74: 866-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Stalled replication forks must be stabilized to avoid collapse into double-strand breaks and to facilitate resumption of DNA synthesis. Upon fork stalling, the phosphoinositide-3 kinase-related kinase ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) activates the replication stress response, which slows cell cycle progression, suppresses new origin firing, and stabilizes stalled replication forks (2Saldivar J.C.

ATR is recruited to replication forks through its obligate binding partner ATR interacting protein (ATRIP) via a direct interaction between ATRIP and replication protein A (RPA) (7Cortez D.

Whether ATR activation occurs via TOPBP1 or ETAA1 is dependent on cell cycle phase and the presence of exogenous DNA damage. In response to replication stress caused by replication inhibitors or DNA damaging agents, ATR signaling is predominantly TOPBP1-dependent, whereas ETAA1 is the primary ATR activator during normal DNA replication and in mitosis (3Saldivar J.C.

Although the AADs do not exhibit significant primary sequence similarity, both are predicted to be intrinsically disordered and both possess a critical tryptophan and predicted coiled-coil motif that are essential for ATR binding and activation (17Thada V.

ATM is activated by the MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex (25Lee J.H. Paull T.T.

ATM activation by DNA double-strand breaks through the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex.Science. 2005; 308: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), and like ATM, MRN is a dimer with two MRE11, RAD50, and NBS1 molecules in a single complex (27Syed A. Tainer J.A. The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 complex conducts the orchestration of damage signaling and outcomes to stress in DNA replication and repair.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 263-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In addition, RAD50 dimerization is required for ATM activation (28Lee J.-H. Mand M.R. Deshpande R.A. Kinoshita E. Yang S.-H. Wyman C. Paull T.T. Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase activity is regulated by ATP-driven conformational changes in the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 12840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of ATM may require dimerization of the ATM activating protein. TOPBP1 forms oligomeric complexes in cells (29Liu K. Paik J.C. Wang B. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Regulation of TopBP1 oligomerization by Akt/PKB for cell survival.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4795-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but how TOPBP1 oligomerization affects ATR activation is not clear. While one study concluded that TOPBP1 dimerization augments ATR signaling (30Zhou Z.W. Liu C. Li T.L. Bruhn C. Krueger A. Min W. Wang Z.Q. Carr A.M. An essential function for the ATR-activation-domain (AAD) of TopBP1 in mouse development and cellular senescence.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9e1003702Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), another concluded that TOPBP1 oligomerization mediated by AKT phosphorylation reduces ATR signaling (31Liu K. Graves J.D. Scott J.D. Li R.B. Lin W.C. Akt switches TopBP1 function from checkpoint activation to transcriptional regulation through phosphoserine binding-mediated oligomerization.Mol. Cell Biol. 2013; 33: 4685-4700Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In our studies, we observe increased ATR activation when the AADs are fused to a dimeric GST tag but not a monomeric maltose binding protein (MBP) tag. We assessed how AAD dimerization affects ATR activation and found that dimerization of both the TOPBP1 and ETAA1 AADs enhances ATR activation. Additionally, ETAA1 forms oligomeric complexes in cells. Expression of a dimeric, but not monomeric, mini-ETAA1 protein complements the hydroxyurea (HU) and camptothecin (CPT) hypersensitivity of ETAA1-deficient cells and restores genome stability. Our results indicate that ETAA1 and TOPBP1 dimerization is likely important for optimal ATR checkpoint signaling. We previously identified the minimal TOPBP1 and ETAA1 AADs by determining which TOPBP1 and ETAA1 fragments were capable of activating ATR in an in vitro kinase assay (17Thada V. Cortez D. Common motifs in ETAA1 and TOPBP1 required for ATR kinase activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 8395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All AADs used in that study had a GST tag. Interestingly, we found that cleavage and removal of the GST tag reduces the ability of the AADs to activate ATR. Even at a threefold higher concentration, ATR activation by untagged TOPBP1 or ETAA1 AADs is still less than activation by the corresponding GST-AADs (compare lanes 2 and 5 and 6 and 9) (Fig. 1A). The substrate used in this experiment (GST-MCM2 79-138) possesses a GST tag that may form a dimer (32McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. Crystal-structures of A schistosomal drug and vaccine target - glutathione-S-transferase from Schistosoma-Japonica and its complex with the leading antischistosomal drug praziquantel.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar); therefore, we assessed whether increased ATR activation by GST-AADs was due to a GST-mediated interaction between substrate and AAD. To do this, we performed kinase assays with the same substrate lacking the GST tag. Again, compared to GST alone, GST-TOPBP1 AAD strongly stimulates ATR kinase activity towards the untagged substrate, while the untagged TOPBP1 AAD does not (Fig. 1B). We also determined how another tag that does not dimerize, MBP, affects ATR activation by the AADs. In contrast to the GST-TOPBP1 AAD, the MBP-TOPBP1 AAD induces minimal, if any, ATR activation toward the untagged substrate (Fig. 1B). We observed the same result with GST-tagged, MBP-tagged, and untagged ETAA1 AADs (Fig. 1C). Together, these results indicate that a GST tag fused to the TOPBP1 and ETAA1 AADs enhances ATR activation without facilitating an interaction with the kinase substrate. Because GST can form a dimer (32McTigue M.A. Williams D.R. Tainer J.A. Crystal-structures of A schistosomal drug and vaccine target - glutathione-S-transferase from Schistosoma-Japonica and its complex with the leading antischistosomal drug praziquantel.J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that GST-mediated AAD dimerization might be the cause of the increased ATR activation. To test this hypothesis directly, we generated AADs with an FKBP F36V tag. Dimerization of proteins fused to FKBP F36V (hereafter referred to as FK) occurs upon incubation with the rapamycin analog AP20187 (Fig. 2A) (33Clackson T. Yang W. Rozamus L.W. Hatada M. Amara J.F. Rollins C.T. Stevenson L.F. Magari S.R. Wood S.A. Courage N.L. Lu X.D. Cerasoli F. Gilman M. Holt D.A. Redesigning an FKBP-ligand interface to generate chemical dimerizers with novel specificity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10437-10442Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). We first determined whether AP20187 induces dimerization of FK-TOPBP1 AAD and/or FK-ETAA1 AAD. In the absence of AP20187, purified FK-TOPBP1 AAD elutes from a size-exclusion column at a retention volume of 15.7 ml, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 29 KDa (Fig. 2B). FK-TOPBP1 AAD has a predicted molecular weight of 28.5 KDa, suggesting that in the absence of AP20187, FK-TOPBP1 AAD is a monomer. Upon preincubation with AP20187, a second FK-TOPBP1 AAD elution peak is observed at a retention volume of 14.6 ml (Fig. 2B). This elution volume corresponds to a molecular weight of 54 KDa, approximately twice the predicted molecular weight of FK-TOPBP1 AAD. Thus, as expected, AP20187 induces FK-TOPBP1 AAD dimerization. FK-ETAA1 AAD has a predicted molecular weight of 31.5 KDa, but in the absence of AP20187 elutes from a size-exclusion column at a retention volume (14.6 ml) corresponding to a molecular weight of 54 KDa (Fig. 2C). The ETAA1 AAD is predicted to be intrinsically disordered and unlikely to form a globular fold (17Thada V. Cortez D. Common motifs in ETAA1 and TOPBP1 required for ATR kinase activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 8395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which may explain this result. Upon preincubation with AP20187, FK-ETAA1 AAD elutes at a second peak of 12.6 ml, which corresponds to a predicted molecular weight of 163 KDa (Fig. 2C). This result is consistent with AP20187 inducing FK-ETAA1 AAD dimerization or oligomerization. Like the FK-ETAA1 AAD, we previously found that the untagged ETAA1 and TOPBP1 AADs elute from a size-exclusion column at larger than predicted molecular weights (17Thada V. Cortez D. Common motifs in ETAA1 and TOPBP1 required for ATR kinase activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 8395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These results could be due to the predicted intrinsic disorder of the AADs or to AAD dimerization. To assess whether the TOPBP1 and ETAA1 AADs dimerize, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Immunoprecipitation of Flag-FK-TOPBP1 AAD coprecipitates HA-FK-TOPBP1 AAD in the presence, but not the absence, of AP20187 (Fig. 2D). The same result is observed when Flag- and HA-FK-ETAA1 AAD are coexpressed in cells (Fig. 2E). These results suggest that the AADs alone are not capable of dimerizing and that their elution profiles in size-exclusion chromatography are likely because they do not fold into a globular structure as is predicted from their high degree of disorder in prediction algorithms. Next, we determined how AAD dimerization affects ATR activation by performing kinase assays with the FK-AADs in the absence or presence of AP20187. FK-TOPBP1 AAD activates ATR more efficiently in the presence of AP20187, and this result is observed regardless of AAD concentration (Fig. 3, A and B). AP20187 also increases ATR activation by the FK-ETAA1 AAD (Fig. 3, C and D). These results are not due to AP20187 off-target effects since basal ATR activation levels and ATR activation by GST-AADs are not changed in the presence of AP20187 (Fig. 3E). Thus, AAD dimerization enhances ATR activation in vitro. Based on our biochemical data, we wondered whether dimerization (or oligomerization) of ATR activating proteins in cells is important for ATR signaling. TOPBP1 oligomerization has been reported to enhance or attenuate ATR signaling (30Zhou Z.W. Liu C. Li T.L. Bruhn C. Krueger A. Min W. Wang Z.Q. Carr A.M.

To determine if ETAA1 forms oligomeric complexes, we expressed Flag-ETAA1 and HA-ETAA1 in cells either alone or in combination and examined potential oligomerization by co-immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation of HA-ETAA1 coprecipitates Flag-ETAA1, and immunoprecipitation of Flag-ETAA1 coprecipitates HA-ETAA1 (Fig. 4A). ETAA1 localizes to ssDNA through a direct interaction with RPA (10Bass T.E. Luzwick J.W. Kavanaugh G. Carroll C. Dungrawala H. Glick G.G. Feldkamp M.D. Putney R. Chazin W.J. Cortez D.

Because ETAA1 contains two RPA interaction motifs that interact with two different RPA subunits, we tested whether ETAA1 oligomerization was dependent on the ETAA1-RPA interaction. Immunoprecipitation of Flag-ETAA1 results in similar coprecipitation of HA-ETAA1 and HA-ETAA1 ΔRPA (a mutant lacking both RPA interaction motifs), indicating that ETAA1 oligomerization occurs independently of RPA binding (Fig. 4B). Next, we attempted to identify a discreet oligomerization domain within ETAA1. We expressed HA-ETAA1 fragments 2–305, 2–570, and 571–926 in cells either alone or in combination with Flag-ETAA1. Immunoprecipitation of Flag-ETAA1 coprecipitates both HA-ETAA1 2–570 and 571–926, but not 2–305 (Fig. 4C). This data suggests that ETAA1 oligomerization may occur through multiple interaction surfaces. We have been unsuccessful in further narrowing the oligomerization surfaces in part because of the instability of ETAA1 fragments and lack of predicted folded domains. Nonetheless, we were interested in determining if ETAA1 oligomerization affects ATR signaling in cells, so investigated whether we could prevent oligomerization by removing most of the ETAA1 regions predicted to be disordered while retaining known functional motifs. To do this, we created a protein we have termed mini-ETAA1, in which we fused ETAA1 amino acids 2–305 to the RPA70 (residues 600–622) and RPA32 (residues 885–926) interaction motifs (Fig. 5A). In addition to the AAD and RPA interaction motifs, mini-ETAA1 also retains CDK-dependent phosphorylation sites that are required for ETAA1-dependent suppression of chromosomal instability (34Achuthankutty D.

Cell Biol. 2019; 218: 3943-3953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the functionality of mini-ETAA1 by measuring ATR activation and RPA binding. Overexpression of both full-length ETAA1 and the ETAA1 AAD results in ectopic ATR activation that can be measured by γH2AX induction (10Bass T.E. Luzwick J.W. Kavanaugh G. Carroll C. Dungrawala H.

FK-mini-ETAA1 overexpression causes a large increase in γH2AX induction and an even greater increase in γH2AX than is caused by FK-ETAA1 AAD overexpression (Fig. 5B). In addition, immunoprecipitation of FK-mini-ETAA1 coprecipitates RPA32 (Fig. 5C). These results indicate FK-mini-ETAA1 is capable of activating ATR and binding RPA. Next, we examined mini-ETAA1 oligomerization. As expected, immunoprecipitation of Flag-FK-mini-ETAA1 results in coprecipitation of HA-FK-mini-ETAA1 in the presence of AP20187. We also detect a substantially attenuated interaction between Flag- and HA-FK-mini-ETAA1 in the absence of AP20187 (Fig. 5D). This small residual interaction is mediated by RPA since immunoprecipitation of Flag-FK-ETAA1 2–305 (which lacks the RPA interaction motifs) only coprecipitates HA-FK-ETAA1 2–305 in the presence, but not absence, of AP20187 (Fig. 5E). We next tested whether monomeric and/or dimeric mini-ETAA1 is sufficient to restore function to ETAA1-deficient cells. First, we assessed ATR-dependent RPA32 phosphorylation in response to CPT, which is reduced in ETAA1-deficient cells (10Bass T.E. Luzwick J.W. Kavanaugh G. Carroll C. Dungrawala H. Glick G.G.

As previously reported, ΔETAA1 cells generated by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing have reduced RPA32 S33 phosphorylation upon CPT treatment compared to wild-type controls or ΔETAA1 cells complemented with FK-full-length ETAA1 (Fig. 6A). Expression of the FK tag by itself does not complement the defect whether or not the dimerization ligand AP20187 is added to the culture media (Fig. 6A). In contrast, ΔETAA1 cells expressing FK-mini-ETAA1 in the absence of AP20187 exhibit partial restoration of RPA32 phosphorylation upon CPT treatment. Importantly, phosphorylation is further increased in these cells in the presence of AP20187 (Fig. 6, A and B). This result is likely due to more potent ATR activation by dimeric FK-mini-ETAA1, but also due to increased recruitment of dimeric FK-mini-ETAA1 to damaged replication forks. Indeed, FK-mini-ETAA1 colocalization with RPA in response to CPT is increased upon a"

MMR deficiency can lead to cancer development and bolsters cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. However, recent studies have shown that checkpoint blockade therapy is effective in MMR-deficient cancers, thus the ability to identify cancer etiology would greatly benefit cancer treatment. MutS homolog 2 (MSH2) is an obligate subunit of mismatch recognition proteins MutSα (MSH2-MSH6) and MutSβ (MSH2-MSH3). Precise regulation of MSH2 is critical, as either over- or underexpression of MSH2 results in an increased mutation frequency. The mechanism by which cells maintain MSH2 proteostasis is unknown. Using functional ubiquitination and deubiquitination assays, we show that the ovarian tumor (OTU) family deubiquitinase ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1 (OTUB1) inhibits MSH2 ubiquitination by blocking the E2 ligase ubiquitin transfer activity. Depleting OTUB1 in cells promotes the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of MSH2, leading to greater mutation frequency and cellular resistance to genotoxic agents, including the common chemotherapy agents N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine and cisplatin. Taken together, our data identify OTUB1 as an important regulator of MSH2 stability and provide evidence that OTUB1 is a potential biomarker for cancer etiology and therapy."

However, the mechanisms by which the retinal regulates Na+ pumping is unknown, in part because KR2 adopts both pentamer and monomer forms in crystal structures and in part because these structures show differences in the protein conformation near the Schiff base, even when they are of the same intermediate state within the photocycle. A particular open question is the nature of the H-bond networks and protonation state in the active site, including Asp116. Here, we analyze the protonation state and the absorption wavelength for each crystal structure, using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical approach. In the pentamer ground state, the calculated absorption wavelength reproduces the experimentally measured absorption wavelength (530 nm). The analysis also shows that ionized Asp116 is stabilized by the H-bond donations of both Ser70 and a cluster of water molecules. The absorption wavelength of 400 nm in the M-state can be best reproduced when the two O atoms of Asp116 interact strongly with the Schiff base, as reported in one of the previous monomer ground state structures.

However, the Na+-binding site in the XRD O-state structure differs from that in the O-state structure obtained from time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography (TR-SFX) using an X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) (XFEL O-state structure) (15Skopintsev P.

The Na+-binding site is formed by the side chains of Asp116, Ser70, and Asn112 and the backbone O of Val67 in the XRD O-state structure (11Kovalev K. Astashkin R. Gushchin I. Orekhov P. Volkov D.

It should also be noted that two water molecules at the Schiff base moiety of the pentamer ground state structure (Fig. 1B) appear to have moved to the positions at the Val66, Ser70, Ile115, and Asp116 moieties in the XRD O-state structure (11Kovalev K.

In microbial rhodopsins, protein function and absorption wavelengths are predominantly determined by the difference in the protein electrostatic environment at the retinal Schiff base moiety (12Tsujimura M. Ishikita H. Insights into the protein functions and absorption wavelengths of microbial rhodopsins.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2020; 124: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Notably, the small difference in the polar residues at the retinal Schiff base binding site is responsible for the difference in the absorption wavelength among microbial rhodopsins with similar functions (12Tsujimura M. Ishikita H. Insights into the protein functions and absorption wavelengths of microbial rhodopsins.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2020; 124: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which is also the case for the difference in the protein conformation at the retinal binding site for each intermediate state (e.g., Fig. 1 for the ground state) among the reported KR2 crystal structures (4Kato H.E.

Femtosecond-to-millisecond structural changes in a light-driven sodium pump.Nature. 2020; 583: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To clarify the involvement of each protein conformation in the functionally relevant intermediate state in the ground → M → O-state transition, we analyze how each KR2 intermediate conformation affects proton transfer between the Schiff base and Asp116 and the absorption wavelength of the retinal Schiff base, using a quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approach. The difference in the H-bond pattern observed in the three ground state structures (Fig. 1, B–D) implies a difference in the pKa value of the retinal Schiff base. Consistently, the potential energy profile of the H-bond between the Schiff base and Asp116 indicates that pKa(Schiff base) > pKa(Asp116) (i.e., the proton is predominantly localized at the Schiff base moiety) in the pentamer and Skopintsev monomer structures, whereas pKa(Schiff base) ≈ pKa(Asp116) (i.e., the proton is exchangeable between the two moieties) in the Kato monomer structure (Figs. 3A and S1). In particular, the pentamer/Kato monomer structures show a significant difference in (i) the presence/absence of W2–W4 and (ii) the side-chain orientation of Asn112, serving as an H-bond donor/acceptor of Ser70 (Fig. 1, B and D). Asn112 serves as an H-bond acceptor of Ser70 in the Kato monomer structure (Fig. 1D). In contrast, Asn112 serves as an H-bond donor to Ser70 in the pentamer structure; thus, Ser70 donates an H-bond to Asp116, which decreases pKa(Asp116) (Fig. 1B). Removal of W2–W4 and mutation of Ser70 to glycine make the shape of the potential energy profile for the pentamer structure symmetric, i.e., pKa(Schiff base) ≈ pKa(Asp116) (Fig. 3B), which resembles that for the Kato monomer structure (Fig. 3A). Indeed, the difference in |pKa(Schiff base) – pKa(Asp116)| between the two KR2 structures can be explained by the electrostatic contributions of W2–W4 and the Ser70 side chain (Table 1). These results suggest that (i) the presence of W2–W4 and (ii) the H-bond donation from Ser70, which is due to the H-bond donation from Asn112, stabilize the ionized state of Asp116, leading to pKa(Schiff base) > pKa(Asp116) in the ground state pentamer structure.Table 1Contributions of the key components to the energy difference between the protonated Schiff base and protonated Asp116 (ΔE) in the pentamer structure (kcal/mol)ComponentsΔEContributions to ΔEPentamer ground state13.6aSee Figure 3.

Open table in a new tab As an M-state structure, in which Na+ is not incorporated into the binding site at the Asp116 moiety in the O-state structure, has not been reported, we tentatively use the Na+-depleted XRD O-state structure as an M state structure (Mlike-state structure, see SI for the QM/MM-optimized atomic coordinates). QM/MM calculations show that pKa(Schiff base) < pKa(Asp116) in the Mlike-state structure, in which Na+ does not exist at the binding site (Fig. 4B). In contrast, pKa(Schiff base) > pKa(Asp116) as Na+ is incorporated into the binding site in the XRD O-state structure (Fig. 4B). In the Mlike-state structure, W2–W4 are absent and Ser70 donates an H-bond not to Asp116, but instead to W2' (Fig. 4A), which increases pKa(Asp116) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in the XRD O-state structure, Asp116 interacts with positively charged Na+, which decreases pKa(Asp116) (Fig. 4, A and B). It seems likely that the proton at the Asp116 moiety migrates again toward the Schiff base moiety in the O-state structure, as Na+ is incorporated into the binding site. Ground state. The calculated absorption wavelength is 540 nm in the pentamer ground state structure (Table 2), which is consistent with the experimentally measured wavelength of 530 nm (11Kovalev K. Astashkin R.

The calculated absorption wavelength of the Skopintsev monomer ground state structure is 35 nm shorter than that of the pentamer ground state structure (and the experimentally measured value, Table 2). The difference in the conformation of Asn112 (Fig. 1, B and C) differentiates the absorption wavelengths of the pentamer and Skopintsev monomer structures by 11 nm. In addition, the experimentally measured absorption wavelength of ∼530 nm (3Inoue K. Ono H. Abe-Yoshizumi R. Yoshizawa S. Ito H. Kogure K. Kandori H.

Open table in a new tab The calculated absorption wavelength of 416 nm for the Kato monomer structure (Table 2) is ∼100 nm shorter than the experimentally measured wavelength in the ground state, mainly because the proton is delocalized over the Schiff base and Asp116 moiety along the low-barrier H-bond (Fig. 3, A) due to the absence of the H-bond donations from Ser70 and a cluster of water molecules (Fig. 1D and Table 1). O-state. The calculated absorption wavelength is 606 nm (Table 2) in the XRD O-state structure reported by Kovalev et al. (11Kovalev K. Astashkin R. Gushchin I. Orekhov P. Volkov D. Zinovev E.

TR-SFX at XFEL by Skopintsev et al. suggested that the Na+-binding site is formed by Asn112 and Asp251 in the O-state (15Skopintsev P. Ehrenberg D. Weinert T. James D. Kar R.K. Johnson P.J. Ozerov D.

Astashkin R. Gushchin I. Orekhov P. Volkov D. Zinovev E. Marin E. Rulev M. Alekseev A. Royant A. Carpentier P. Vaganova S. Zabelskii D. Baeken C.

A similar site was also proposed by MD simulations (20Suomivuori C.-M. Gamiz-Hernandez A.P. Sundholm D. Kaila V.R.I. Energetics and dynamics of a light-driven sodium-pumping rhodopsin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 7043-7048Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The absorption wavelength calculated using the XFEL O-state structure (obtained at 1 ms) (15Skopintsev P. Ehrenberg D. Weinert T. James D. Kar R.K. Johnson P.J. Ozerov D. Furrer A. Martiel I. Dworkowski F. Femtosecond-to-millisecond structural changes in a light-driven sodium pump.Nature. 2020; 583: 314-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) is 596 nm (Table 2), which is also consistent with the experimentally measured value (602 nm (11Kovalev K. Astashkin R. Gushchin I. Orekhov P. Volkov D. Zinovev E. Marin E. Rulev M. Alekseev A. Royant A. Carpentier P. Vaganova S. Zabelskii D. Baeken C. Sergeev I. et al.Molecular mechanism of light-driven sodium pumping.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). These results suggest that both the XRD and XFEL structures are functionally relevant conformations because the experimentally measured absorption wavelength can be reproduced only when the geometry of the retinal Schiff base moiety is functionally relevant (12Tsujimura M. Ishikita H. Insights into the protein functions and absorption wavelengths of microbial rhodopsins.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2020; 124: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To identify the factors that differentiate the absorption wavelengths between the pentamer ground and XRD O-states, the electrostatic contribution of each group to the absorption wavelength of the retinal Schiff base was analyzed (Fig. 5C). In the XRD O-state structure, Na+ near the Schiff base contributes to an increase in the absorption wavelength of 16 nm. Notably, Asp116 and Asp251 (counterion residues) are responsible for the significant difference in the absorption wavelengths (38 and 20 nm, respectively) between the two states (Fig. 5C). Both the ground (Fig. 5D) and O-state (Fig. 5A) structures maintain Asp116 and Asp251 at identical positions with respect to the retinal Schiff base (∼2.8 Å and ∼4.0 Å, respectively). However, the present quantum chemical calculations indicate that in the S0 state, the C=N site of the retinal Schiff base is more positively charged in the pentamer ground state structure than in the O-state structure (Fig. 5E). Meanwhile, retinal Schiff base is less distorted in the C13=C14 region in the pentamer ground state structure than in the O-state structure (Table S1). Note that the Schiff base (C=N) region is more positively charged as the C13=C14 region is plainer (Fig. S2). Thus, negatively charged Asp116 and Asp251 stabilize the S0 state in the ground state structure more effectively than in the O-state structure. This could explain why Asp116 and Asp251 are responsible for the difference in the absorption wavelengths between the two states. It seems likely that charged groups near the retinal Schiff base (i.e., Asp116, Asp251, and Na+) predominantly determine the absorption wavelength in KR2, as demonstrated for 13 microbial rhodopsins (12Tsujimura M. Ishikita H. Insights into the protein functions and absorption wavelengths of microbial rhodopsins.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2020; 124: 11819-11826Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Asp116 is considered to be deprotonated in the ground state (4Kato H.E. Inoue K. Abe-Yoshizumi R. Kato Y. Ono H. Konno M. Hososhima S. Ishizuka T. Hoque M.R. Kunitomo H. Ito J. Yoshizawa S. Yamashita K. Takemoto M. Nishizawa T. et al.Structural basis for Na+ transport mechanism by a light-driven Na+ pump.Nature. 2015; 521: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar); the present results indicate that (i) the H-bond donation from Ser70 to Asp116 and (ii) the formation of a cluster of water molecules near Asp116 are essential components for Schiff base protonation in the ground state (Table 1). The Schiff base is protonated in the pentamer and Skopintsev monomer structures (Fig. 3A), whereas the proton is not localized at the Schiff base moiety in the Kato monomer structure (Fig. 3A). Among the three ground state structures, Ser70 does not donate an H-bond to Asp116 only in the Kato monomer structure (Fig. 1, B–D), which destabilizes the Asp116 ionized state and causes the Schiff base proton to migrate toward Asp116. A cluster of water molecules W1–W4 near Asp116 in the pentamer ground state structure resembles that near redox-active D1-Tyr161 and the H-bond partner D1-His190 in the water-oxidizing enzyme photosystem II (PSII) (21Saito K. Shen J.-R. Ishida T. Ishikita H. Short hydrogen bond between redox-active tyrosine YZ and D1-His190 in the photosystem II crystal structure.Biochemistry. 2011; 50: 9836-9844Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 22Kawashima K. Saito K. Ishikita H. Mechanism of radical formation in the H-bond network of D1-Asn298 in photosystem II.Biochemistry. 2018; 57: 4997-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). In PSII, the water molecules are more ordered because the water cluster is fixed by the highly polarized oxygen-evolving complex, the Mn4CaO5 cluster. Thus, one of the water molecules (W7) can donate a stable H-bond to TyrZ and decrease pKa (TyrZ) to the level of pKa (D1-His190), leading to the formation of a low-barrier H-bond (Fig. 6). In KR2, one of the water molecules (W3) can donate a stable H-bond to Asp116 (Figs. 1B and 6), leading to Asp116 ionization and Schiff base protonation (Fig. 3A). In KR2, the Schiff base is deprotonated only in the M state (17Nishimura N. Mizuno M. Kandori H. Mizutani Y. Distortion and a strong hydrogen bond in the retinal chromophore enable sodium-ion transport by the sodium-ion pump KR2.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2019; 123: 3430-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The Mlike-state structure suggests that the Schiff base can be deprotonated by the absence of W2–W4 and the absence of the Ser70 H-bond donation to Asp116 (Fig. 4). The experimentally measured absorption wavelength in the M-state is significantly short (∼400 nm (3Inoue K. Ono H. Abe-Yoshizumi R. Yoshizawa S. Ito H. Kogure K. Kandori H. A light-driven sodium ion pump in marine bacteria.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 1678Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar)) with respect to the ground (530 nm (11Kovalev K. Astashkin R. Gushchin I. Orekhov P. Volkov D. Zinovev E. Marin E. Rulev M. Alekseev A. Royant A. Carpentier P. Vaganova S. Zabelskii D. Baeken C. Sergeev I. et al.Molecular mechanism of light-driven sodium pumping.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)) and O-states (602 nm (11Kovalev K. Astashkin R. Gushchin I. Orekhov P. Volkov D. Zinovev E. Marin E. Rulev M. Alekseev A. Royant A. Carpentier P. Vaganova S. Zabelskii D. Baeken C. Sergeev I. et al.Molecular mechanism of light-driven sodium pumping.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)). The calculated absorption wavelength is also short (452 nm) for the Mlike-state structure (Table 2), which in turn suggests that the ∼150 nm longer absorption wavelength for the O-state is predominantly due to the incorporation of Na+. Intriguingly, the absorption wavelength of 416 nm calculated for the Kato monomer ground state structure is closer to the experimentally measured absorption wavelength for the M-state (400 nm) than that calculated for the Mlike-state structure (452 nm, Table 2). This is because Asp116 interacts more strongly with the Schiff base in the Kato monomer ground state structure (NLys255…OAsp116 = 2.5 Å and 3.2 Å, Fig. 7) than in the Mlike-state structure ((NLys255…OAsp116 = 2.6 Å and 4.7 Å, Fig. 7). In addition, the Schiff base can be deprotonated in both the Kato monomer ground- and Mlike-state structures (Figs. 3A and 4B), which is characteristic of the M-state (17Nishimura N. Mizuno M. Kandori H. Mizutani Y. Distortion and a strong hydrogen bond in the retinal chromophore enable sodium-ion transport by the sodium-ion pump KR2.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2019; 123: 3430-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Indeed, the Kato monomer ground state structure was originally crystalized at pH 4.0 (4Kato H.E. Inoue K. Abe-Yoshizumi R. Kato Y. Ono H. Konno M. Hososhima S. Ishizuka T. Hoque M.R. Kunitomo H. Ito J. Yoshizawa S. Yamashita K. Takemoto M. Nishizawa T. et al.Structural basis for Na+ transport mechanism by a light-driven Na+ pump.Nature. 2015; 521: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), where Asp116 is more likely to be protonated. Based on the absorption wavelength and the protonation state of the Schiff base, it seems possible that the Kato monomer ground state is more likely to represent the M-state than the ground state. Based on the observations presented here, we are able to propose a Na+-pumping mechanism for KR2 (Fig. 8). In the ground state, Ser70 donates an H-bond to Asp116. The water cluster also donates a stable H-bond to Asp116, as suggested by the QM/MM-optimized pentamer structure (Fig. 1B). Thus, the ionized state of Asp116 and the protonated state of the Schiff base are stabilized in the ground state. In the M-state, the H-bond donation to ionized Asp116 from the Ser70 side chain is absent (Fig. 7). In addition, the loss of a cluster of water molecules, which also donates a stable H-bond to ionized Asp116 in the ground state, destabilizes the Asp116 ionization, leading to Schiff base deprotonation (Fig. 4B). The link between the loss of the water cluster near Asp116 and the loss of the positive charge of the Schiff base resembles the loss of the water cluster molecules near TyrZ…D1-His190 upon depletion of Ca2+ from the Mn4CaO5 cluster in PSII (23Saito K.

Energetics of ionized water molecules in the H-bond network near the Ca2+ and Cl– binding sites in photosystem II.Biochemistry. 2020; 59: 3216-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It seems likely that the retinal Schiff base photoisomerization ultimately induces Asp116 protonation via the displacement of water molecules upon M-state formation. The deprotonation of the Schiff base allows Na+ to approach the uncharged Schiff base moiety in the M state. Once Na+ is incorporated into the Schiff base moiety upon the O-state formation, the release of the proton from protonated Asp116 toward the Schiff base and the formation of the salt bridge between ionized Asp116 and Na+ can be energetically advantageous (Fig. 2A). In the O-state, Na+ binds initially at Asp116 (i.e., XRD O-state structure, Fig. 2A) and subsequently at Asn112 and Asp251 (i.e., XFEL O-state structure, Fig. 2B), as suggested in metadynamics simulations (11Kovalev K.

Because the calculated absorption wavelengths for the XRD and XFEL O-state structures (606 nm and 596 nm, Table 2) reproduce the experimentally measured wavelength of 602 nm (11Kovalev K.

Sergeev I. et al.Molecular mechanism of light-driven sodium pumping.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) irrespective of the difference in the Na+-binding site, it seems likely that both of them represent functionally relevant O-state structures. The H-bond donations to Asp116 from the Ser70 side chain and water cluster stabilize the ionized state of Asp116, which leads to pKa(Schiff base) > pKa(Asp116) (Fig. 3). The pentamer ground state structure corresponds to the functionally relevant ground state, as the calculated absorption wavelength (540 nm, Table 2) also reproduces the experimentally measured wavelength (530 nm (11Kovalev K.

https://openalex.org/W3133761268,"Effective control of infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), requires continuous and life-long use of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by people living with HIV-1 (PLWH). In the absence of ART, HIV-1 reemergence from latently infected cells is ineffectively suppressed due to suboptimal innate and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. However, ART-free control of HIV-1 infection may be possible if the inherent immunological deficiencies can be reversed or restored. Herein we present a novel approach for modulating the immune response to HIV-1 that involves the use of non-thermal plasma (NTP), which is an ionized gas containing various reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS). J-Lat cells were used as a model of latent HIV-1 infection to assess the effects of NTP application on viral latency and the expression of pro-phagocytic and pro-chemotactic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Exposure of J-Lat cells to NTP resulted in stimulation of HIV-1 gene expression, indicating a role in latency reversal, a necessary first step in inducing adaptive immune responses to viral antigens. This was accompanied by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ); the display of pro-phagocytic markers calreticulin (CRT), heat shock proteins (HSP) 70 and 90; and a correlated increase in macrophage phagocytosis of NTP-exposed J-Lat cells. In addition, modulation of surface molecules that promote or inhibit antigen presentation was also observed, along with an altered array of displayed peptides on MHC I, further suggesting methods by which NTP may modify recognition and targeting of cells in latent HIV-1 infection. These studies represent early progress toward an effective NTP-based ex vivo immunotherapy to resolve the dysfunctions of the immune system that enable HIV-1 persistence in PLWH."
https://openalex.org/W3134285372,"Coronary heart disease, an inflammatory disease, is the leading cause of death globally. White blood cell counts (including monocytes) are easily available biomarkers of systemic inflammation. Monocyte subtypes can be measured by flow cytometry and classified into classical (CD14 high , CD16 neg ), intermediate (CD14 high , CD16 + ) and non-classical (CD14 + , CD16 high ) with distinct functional properties. The goal of this study was to investigate the association of monocyte total count and its subtypes with cardiovascular risk groups defined by the Framingham Risk Score, which is used to estimate the 10-year risk of developing myocardial infarction or predict mortality following coronary heart disease. We also aimed to investigate whether monocyte counts are associated with relevant cardiovascular risk factors not included in the Framingham Risk Score, such as carotid atherosclerotic plaque and intima-media thickness. Our data came from the LIFE-Adult study, a population-based cohort study of 10,000 randomly selected participants in Leipzig, Germany. Data was gathered using self-administered questionnaires and physical examinations. Carotid plaques and intima-media thickness were measured using carotid artery sonography. Monocyte subtypes in blood were determined by 10-color flow cytometry for a total of 690 individuals. In a multivariate regression analysis adjusting for the risk factors BMI, intima-media thickness, presence of carotid plaques and diabetes mellitus, monocyte subtypes and total count were found to be significantly associated with the dichotomized Framingham Risk Score (≥10% versus &lt;10%): Odds ratios [95% confidence interval] for monocyte subtypes: classical: 11.19 [3.79–34.26]; intermediate: 2.27 [1.11–4.71]; non-classical: 4.18 [1.75–10.20]; total: 14.59 [4.61–47.95]. In absence of prospective data, the FRS was used as a surrogate for CHD. Our results indicate that monocyte counts could provide useful predictive value for cardiovascular disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W3131477119,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) are tightly regulated by multiple conserved auxiliary proteins, including the four fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FGFs), which bind the Nav EF-hand like domain (EFL), and calmodulin (CaM), a multifunctional messenger protein that binds the NaV IQ motif. The EFL domain and IQ motif are contiguous regions of NaV cytosolic C-terminal domains (CTD), placing CaM and FGF in close proximity. However, whether the FGFs and CaM act independently, directly associate, or operate through allosteric interactions to regulate channel function is unknown. Titrations monitored by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, structural studies with solution NMR, and computational modeling demonstrated for the first time that both domains of (Ca2+)4-CaM (but not apo CaM) directly bind two sites in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of A-type FGF splice variants (FGF11A, FGF12A, FGF13A, and FGF14A) with high affinity. The weaker of the (Ca2+)4-CaM-binding sites was known via electrophysiology to have a role in long-term inactivation of the channel but not known to bind CaM. FGF12A binding to a complex of CaM associated with a fragment of the NaV1.2 CTD increased the Ca2+-binding affinity of both CaM domains, consistent with (Ca2+)4-CaM interacting preferentially with its higher-affinity site in the FGF12A NTD. Thus, A-type FGFs can compete with NaV IQ motifs for (Ca2+)4-CaM. During spikes in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that accompany an action potential, CaM may translocate from the NaV IQ motif to the FGF NTD, or the A-type FGF NTD may recruit a second molecule of CaM to the channel.

The human voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV) are a family of nine proteins (NaV1.1–NaV1.9) that are responsible for the generation and propagation of action potentials in excitable tissues throughout the human body. The functional core of each NaV is a single transmembrane pore-forming α-subunit that interacts with one or more auxiliary β-subunits (Fig. 1, A and B) (1Messner D.J. Catterall W.A. The sodium channel from rat brain. Separation and characterization of subunits.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10597-10604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of NaVs requires the α-subunit to rapidly transition among closed, opened, and inactivated states. The importance of rapidly cycling among these functional states is highlighted by the identification of disease-causing mutations throughout the sequences of the NaV isoforms that disrupt this process to cause debilitating conditions including epileptic disorders (2Fujiwara T.

Recently, an indirect allosteric interaction has been proposed to occur between CaM and FGF12B on NaV1.4 (52Niu J. Dick I.E. Yang W. Bamgboye M.A. Yue D.T. Tomaselli G. Inoue T. Ben-Johny M. Allosteric regulators selectively prevent Ca2+-feedback of CaV and NaV channels.Elife. 2018; 7e35222Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, there has been no evidence supporting CaM directly binding any splice variant of an FGF isoform. Here we report for the first time that CaM binds the NTD of each A-type FGF (FGF11A, FGF12A, FGF13A, and FGF14A) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, copurification, and solution NMR, we show that CaM binds two sequences in the NTD of each A-type FGF with high affinity and that both domains of (Ca2+)4-CaM mediate this interaction. Focusing on FGF12 because of the cellular and structural studies cited above, we demonstrate that binding of full-length FGF12A to a fragment of the NaV1.2 CTD (NaV1.2CTD, residues 1777–1937) containing the EFL and IQ motif increases the Ca2+ affinity of both CaM domains. Because the IQ motif is known to lower Ca2+ affinity of CaMC, this new finding is consistent with (Ca2+)4-CaM interacting favorably with the NTD of FGF12A in this ternary complex. These results support a model in which the A-type FGFs compete with NaV IQ motifs for (Ca2+)4-CaM and suggest that, during spikes in the local cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, CaM may translocate from an NaV IQ motif to an A-type FGF NTD or that the NTD may recruit an additional CaM molecule to the ternary complex. CaM is known to bind tightly to sequences that are intrinsically disordered but that adopt helical geometry when bound by CaM. The NTD sequences of A-type splice variants of intracellular FGFs are thought to be disordered. However, an analysis of the FGF11A, FGF12A, FGF13A, and FGF14A sequences with the Protein Disorder Prediction System (53Ishida T. Kinoshita K. Prediction of disordered regions in proteins based on the meta approach.Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 1344-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) showed two minima in the NTD of each FGF isoform (Fig. 1, C and D) suggesting that two segments are capable of adopting ordered secondary structure and might be CaM-binding sites. One sequence is near the N terminus of the NTD (referred to as the long-term inactivation particle or LTP). It is highly conserved among the four human FGF isoforms (Fig. 1E) and across species (Fig. S1, A–D, Table S1–S4) and was shown to contribute functionally to long-term inactivation of NaVs mediated by A-type FGFs (43Dover K. Solinas S. D'Angelo E. Goldfarb M. Long-term inactivation particle for voltage-gated sodium channels.J. Physiol. 2010; 588: 3695-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The other sequence is C terminal to the LTP (referred to hereafter as the CaM-binding domain (CaMBD)). Although the CaMBD has a more variable sequence among the four human FGF isoforms (Fig. 1F), the CaMBD sequence of each isoform is highly conserved across species (Fig. S1, E–H, Table S5–S8). Currently it has no known function. To explore whether the FGF LTP and CaMBD regions might function as CaM-binding sites, α-helical models were made with PyMOL and helical wheels were generated based on the sequence of the FGF12A LTP and CaMBD (Fig. S2, A–F). The sequences each contained an aliphatic patch bracketed by basic residues consistent with other BAA motifs that are known to bind tightly to CaM. To understand whether these putative sites in the FGF NTD would be accessible to CaM, it would be helpful to have an experimentally determine"
https://openalex.org/W3134093498,"Background A large body of evidence suggests that self-management interventions (SMIs) may improve outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, accurate comparisons of the relative effectiveness of SMIs are challenging, partly due to heterogeneity of outcomes across trials and uncertainty about the importance of these outcomes for patients. We aimed to develop a core set of patient-relevant outcomes (COS) for SMIs trials to enhance comparability of interventions and ensure person-centred care. Methods We undertook an innovative approach consisting of four interlinked stages: i) Development of an initial catalogue of outcomes from previous EU-funded projects and/or published studies, ii) Scoping review of reviews on patients and caregivers’ perspectives to identify outcomes of interest, iii) Two-round Delphi online survey with patients and patient representatives to rate the importance of outcomes, and iv) Face-to-face consensus workshop with patients, patient representatives, health professionals and researchers to develop the COS. Results From an initial list of 79 potential outcomes, 16 were included in the COS plus one supplementary outcome relevant to all participants. These were related to patient and caregiver knowledge/competence, self-efficacy, patient activation, self-monitoring, adherence, smoking cessation, COPD symptoms, physical activity, sleep quality, caregiver quality of life, activities of daily living, coping with the disease, participation and decision-making, emergency room visits/admissions and cost effectiveness. Conclusion The development of the COPD COS for the evaluation of SMIs will increase consistency in the measurement and reporting of outcomes across trials. It will also contribute to more personalized health care and more informed health decisions in clinical practice as patients’ preferences regarding COPD outcomes are more systematically included."

The GSE4 peptide is able to rescue cells from senescence, DNA and oxidative damage, inflammation, and induces telomerase activity. Here, we investigated the protective effect of GSE4 expression in vitro in rat alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), and in vivo in a bleomycin model of lung fibrosis. Bleomycin-injured rat AECs, expressing GSE4 or treated with GSE4-PLGA/PEI nanoparticles showed an increase of telomerase activity, decreased DNA damage, and decreased expression of IL6 and cleaved-caspase 3. In addition, these cells showed an inhibition in expression of fibrotic markers induced by TGF-β such as collagen-I and III among others. Furthermore, treatment with GSE4-PLGA/PEI nanoparticles in a rat model of bleomycin-induced fibrosis, increased telomerase activity and decreased DNA damage in proSP-C cells. Both in preventive and therapeutic protocols GSE4-PLGA/PEI nanoparticles prevented and attenuated lung damage monitored by SPECT-CT and inhibited collagen deposition. Lungs of rats treated with bleomycin and GSE4-PLGA/PEI nanoparticles showed reduced expression of α-SMA and pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased number of pro-SPC-multicellular structures and increased DNA synthesis in proSP-C cells, indicating therapeutic efficacy of GSE4-nanoparticles in experimental lung fibrosis and a possible curative treatment for lung fibrotic patients."
https://openalex.org/W3129835914,"Numerous mammalian species have adapted to the chronic hypoxia of high altitude. Recent genomic studies have identified evidence for natural selection of genes and associated genetic changes in these species. A major gap in our knowledge is an understanding of the functional significance, if any, of these changes. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) live at both low and high altitudes in North America, providing an opportunity to identify functionally important genetic changes. High-altitude deer mice show evidence of natural selection on the Epas1 gene, which encodes for hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (Hif-2α), a central transcription factor of the hypoxia-inducible factor pathway. An SNP encoding for a T755M change in the Hif-2α protein is highly enriched in high-altitude deer mice, but its functional significance is unknown. Here, using coimmunoprecipitation and transcriptional activity assays, we show that the T755M mutation produces a defect in the interaction of Hif-2α with the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein. This results in a loss of function because of decreased transcriptional activity. Intriguingly, the effect of this mutation depends on the amino acid context. Interchanges between methionine and threonine at the corresponding position in house mouse (Mus musculus) Hif-2α are without effects on CREB-binding protein binding. Furthermore, transfer of a set of deer mouse–specific Hif-2α amino acids to house mouse Hif-2α is sufficient to confer sensitivity of house mouse Hif-2α to the T755M substitution. These findings provide insight into high-altitude adaptation in deer mice and evolution at the Epas1 locus. Numerous mammalian species have adapted to the chronic hypoxia of high altitude.

These findings provide insight into high-altitude adaptation in deer mice and evolution at the Epas1 locus. The chronic hypoxia of high altitude presents a substantial challenge to metazoans residing in this environment. Recent studies have revealed evidence of genetic adaptation to high altitude in multiple mammalian species. These include humans who reside on the Tibetan plateau, the Andean Altiplano, and Ethiopian Simien Mountains (1Bigham A.W. Lee F.S. Human high-altitude adaptation: Forward genetics meets the HIF pathway.Genes Dev. 2014; 28: 2189-2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), as well as Tibetan dogs, yaks, sheep, and horses (2Witt K.E.

Genet. 2020; 11: 743Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In many of these species, there is evidence for natural selection acting on genes of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, the main transcriptional pathway by which cells respond to hypoxia (4Kaelin Jr., W.G.

The HIF pathway relies on two oxygen-dependent enzymes that act on the α subunit of the transcription factor HIF (HIF-α). One is prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2), which catalyzes prolyl hydroxylation in the oxygen-dependent degradation (ODD) domain of HIF-α (7Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha is mediated by an O2- dependent degradation domain via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

McKnight S.L. A conserved family of prolyl-4-hydroxylases that modify HIF.Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Prolyl hydroxylated HIF-α (of which there are two main paralogues, HIF-1α and HIF-2α) is recognized by the von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein, which then targets HIF-α for degradation. Under hypoxia, prolyl hydroxylation is arrested, leading to the stabilization of HIF-α. HIF-α dimerizes with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator through their basic Helix Loop Helix-Period Arnt Sim domains to form a transcription factor complex. The other critical oxygen-dependent enzyme in this pathway is factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), which catalyzes asparaginyl hydroxylation in the C-terminal transactivation domain (CTAD) of HIF-α (10Cockman M.E. Webb J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. FIH-dependent asparaginyl hydroxylation of ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins.Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Whitelaw M.L. Asparagine hydroxylation of the HIF transactivation domain a hypoxic switch.Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). This hydroxylation blocks the interaction of the CTAD with CREB-binding protein (CBP), a transcriptional coactivator with lysine acetyltransferase activity. CBP is a component of the transcription preinitiation complex, and it acetylates lysines 27 and 18 on histone H3, marks characteristic of active chromatin (13Attar N. Kurdistani S.K. Exploitation of EP300 and CREBBP lysine acetyltransferases by Cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2017; 7a026534Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Under hypoxia, asparaginyl hydroxylation is arrested, leading to the binding of HIF-α to CBP and activation of the CTAD. HIF activates hundreds of genes involved in cellular and systemic responses to hypoxia (14Schodel J. Mole D.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Pan-genomic binding of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors.Biol. Chem. 2013; 394: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HIF-1α, which is ubiquitously expressed, upregulates the genes of glycolysis and thereby promotes a shift from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis. HIF-2α, with a more restricted expression that is tissue and cell type specific, plays a critical role in other aspects of the hypoxic response (15Lappin T.R. Lee F.S.

North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) reside at both low and high altitudes, providing an opportunity to examine genes that might facilitate hypoxic adaption (19Storz J.F. Cheviron Z.A.

Mammal. 2019; 100: 910-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which this occurs is through amino acid substitutions in the α and β chains of hemoglobin that increase binding affinity for oxygen (20Storz J.F. Moriyama H. Mechanisms of hemoglobin adaptation to high altitude hypoxia.High Alt. Med. Biol. 2008; 9: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It has recently been reported that the Epas1 gene, which encodes for Hif-2α, is under natural selection in high-altitude deer mice (21Schweizer R.M. Velotta J.P. Ivy C.M. Jones M.R. Muir S.M. Bradburd G.S. Storz J.F. Scott G.R. Cheviron Z.A. Physiological and genomic evidence that selection on the transcription factor Epas1 has altered cardiovascular function in high-altitude deer mice.PLoS Genet. 2019; 15e1008420Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Epas1 gene is the target of selection in multiple high-altitude species (2Witt K.E. Huerta-Sanchez E. Convergent evolution in human and domesticate adaptation to high-altitude environments.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2019; 374: 20180235Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 3Pamenter M.E. Hall J.E. Tanabe Y. Simonson T.S. Cross-species insights into genomic adaptations to hypoxia.Front. Genet. 2020; 11: 743Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding mechanisms by which high-altitude Epas1 alleles might be adaptive. In deer mice, the high-altitude allele is correlated with decreased expression of adrenal catecholamine synthesis genes and an increased heart rate under hypoxic conditions. The highest ranking SNP in the Epas1 gene resides in exon 14 and encodes for a T755M polymorphism. This SNP is not present in deer mice at sea level, and it rises to a frequency of >0.8 in deer mouse populations at high altitude (21Schweizer R.M. Velotta J.P. Ivy C.M. Jones M.R. Muir S.M. Bradburd G.S. Storz J.F. Scott G.R. Cheviron Z.A. Physiological and genomic evidence that selection on the transcription factor Epas1 has altered cardiovascular function in high-altitude deer mice.PLoS Genet. 2019; 15e1008420Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the primary sequence, amino acid 755 resides between and is distant from the ODD domain and CTAD. Therefore, it is not intuitively obvious whether the polymorphism has any functional significance. There are no other Epas1 SNPs under selection that produce a change in the amino acid sequence. Here we provide evidence that high-altitude deer mouse Hif-2α is a loss of function allele that produces a defect in the interaction of Hif-2α with Cbp. This provides a framework for understanding high-altitude adaptation in deer mice and shows a naturally occurring mutation in a mammalian Epas1 gene that affects the function of the CTAD of Hif-2α. More broadly, it provides important information for understanding convergent evolution at the Epas1 locus in mammalian high-altitude species. To test whether the T755M mutation affects protein stability, we transfected HEK293FT cells with constructs for WT and T755M deer mouse Hif-2α, exposed some cells to hypoxia (0.5% O2), and then examined protein levels by Western blotting. We did not observe any significant difference in protein levels between WT and T755M deer mouse Hif-2α under either normoxia or hypoxia (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 and 3, and lanes 5 and 6). The ODD domain of Hif-2α interacts with two proteins—Phd2 when not hydroxylated, and Vhl when hydroxylated. We examined these interactions. We were not able to detect binding between Hif-2α and Phd2 under hypoxia (data not shown). As an alternative, we used dimethyloxalylglycine, an active site inhibitor of 2-oxoglutarate dependent enzymes (which includes Phd2), that allows for the formation of enzyme:substrate complexes (22Cockman M.E. Webb J.D. Kramer H.B. Kessler B.M. Ratcliffe P.J. Proteomics-based identification of novel factor inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH) substrates indicates widespread asparaginyl hydroxylation of ankyrin repeat domain-containing proteins.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2009; 8: 535-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We transfected cells with WT or T755M deer mouse Hif-2α constructs along with one for Phd2, exposed cells to dimethyloxalylglycine, and examined Phd2 immunoprecipitates for Hif-2α. We do not see any appreciable differences in the interaction of Phd2 with WT and T755M deer mouse Hif-2α (Fig. 1, B and C). To examine the binding of Vhl with hydroxylated Hif-2α, we transfected cells with the Hif-2α constructs along with one encoding for deer mouse Vhl. We treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 to stabilize the prolyl hydroxylated from of Hif-2α. We observe no significant differences in the amount of WT and T755M Hif-2α recovered in Vhl immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1, D and E). The CTAD (residues 834–874) of Hif-2α can bind Fih. We fused WT or T755M deer mouse Hif-2α (669–874), which contains the CTAD, to the DNA-binding domain of the GAL4 protein. We transfected cells with these constructs along with one for deer mouse Fih and exposed cells to hypoxia (0.5% O2) to stabilize the nonhydroxylated form of Hif-2α. Hif-2α (669–874) is detectable in Fih immunoprecipitates, and we do not see a difference in the interaction with Fih between WT and T755M deer mouse Hif-2α (669–874) (Fig. 1F, lanes 2 and 4). In its nonhydroxylated form, the CTAD can interact with Cbp through the zinc finger–containing CH1 (also known as TAZ1) domain of the latter (23Dames S.A. Martinez-Yamout M. De Guzman R.N. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Structural basis for Hif-1 alpha/CBP recognition in the cellular hypoxic response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5271-5276Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). We transfected cells with the Hif-2α (669–874) constructs along with one for the CH1 domain of deer mouse Cbp (residues 338–442, fused to GST). We exposed the cells to hypoxia (0.5% O2) to block hydroxylation and examined Cbp immunoprecipitates for Hif-2α. In contrast to the interactions with Phd2, Vhl, and Fih, the T755M mutation in Hif-2α dramatically impairs the interaction with Cbp (Fig. 2A). We observed the same result with full-length WT and T755M Hif-2α (Fig. 2B). Longer exposures of these Western blots reveal a weak Hif-2α band in the Cbp immunoprecipitates. Therefore, the mutation is hypomorphic, that is, it produces a partial but not complete loss of function. Previous studies have shown that an Asn > Ala substitution at the site of Fih-catalyzed hydroxylation (Asn-851 in deer mouse Hif-2α) allows constitutive Cbp binding and CTAD activation under normoxia (12Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Asparagine hydroxylation of the HIF transactivation domain a hypoxic switch.Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation studies using Hif-2α (669–874) N851A show that this substitution (N851A) in Hif-2α allows CTAD:Cbp binding under normoxia in a manner sensitive to the T755M mutation (Fig. 2C, lanes 2 and 4). We assessed the interaction of these two Hif-2α (669–874) proteins with endogenous Cbp in a murine cellular environment by transfecting mouse N2a cells with the Hif-2α (669–874) constructs and then immunoprecipitating the Hif-2α. The T755M mutation impairs the interaction with endogenous Cbp in this experimental setting (Fig. 2D, lanes 2 and 3). The protein p300 is a paralogue of Cbp with a homologous zinc finger that interacts with the CTAD (24Freedman S.J. Sun Z.Y. Poy F. Kung A.L. Livingston D.M. Wagner G. Eck M.J. Structural basis for recruitment of CBP/p300 by hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5367-5372Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). We examined the interaction of Hif-2α (669–874) N851A with the CH1 zinc finger domain of deer mouse p300 (residues 324–428). In contrast to Cbp, binding is maintained with the T755M mutation (Fig. 2E, lanes 2 and 4). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that there might be subtle effects on the binding of the T755M mutant to Phd2, Vhl, Fih, or p300, the results indicate that the T755M mutation in deer mouse Hif-2α primarily impairs interaction with Cbp. To assess transcriptional activity, we transfected 293FT cells with constructs for full-length Hif-2α–bearing mutations at the prolyl (P529A) and asparaginyl (N851A) sites that lead to constitutive activity under normoxia (to allow assessment of Hif-2α activity in the absence of endogenous HIF), along with a luciferase reporter gene driven by three copies of hypoxia response element from the ERYTHROPOIETIN gene (25Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Dynamic, site-specific interaction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha with the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4136-4142PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of the P529A/N851A substitutions, the T755M mutant of deer mouse Hif-2α has lower transcriptional activity than WT (Fig. 3A). We examined the transcriptional activity of the GAL4–Hif-2α (669–874) fusion protein (without the N581A mutation) under normoxia and hypoxia with the use of a luciferase reporter gene driven by GAL4 binding sites. Hypoxia induces higher reporter gene activity from the WT Hif-2α (669–874) fusion protein, and the T755M mutation confers lower activity under either normoxia or hypoxia (Fig. 3B). The activity of Hif-2α is only partially reduced in these reporter gene assays, consistent with the partial (as opposed to complete) loss of interaction with Cbp and the preservation of interaction with p300. We assessed the effect of the T755M mutation on endogenous Hif-2α gene targets by generating HEK293 cells stably expressing WT and T755M deer mouse Hif-2α from an isogenic locus (using the Flp-In TRex system) (Fig. 3, C and D). These two constructs were in the P529A/N851A background to allow assessment under normoxia and avoid interference from endogenous HIF. Deer mouse Hif-2α induces transcriptional activation of the HIF-2α target genes VEGFA, NDRG1, ADM, and SLC7A5 (Fig. 3, E–H). Importantly, the T755M mutation diminishes activation of these genes. The deer mouse mutation changes residue 755 to an amino acid, methionine, that is the native amino acid at residue 755 in house mouse (Mus musculus) Hif-2α (MmHif-2α). We examined the effect of the converse substitution, M755T, on the interaction between house mouse Hif-2α with house mouse Cbp (338–442), the sequence of which is identical to deer mouse Cbp (338–442). In contrast to deer mouse Hif-2α, we find that both WT (M755) and M755T house mouse Hif-2α (670–874) interact with Cbp (Fig. 3I, lanes 2 and 4). Therefore, the interchange between methionine and threonine at this position in house mouse Hif-2α lacks the same functional effect that is observed in deer mouse Hif-2α. Besides amino acid 755, deer mouse Hif-2α (669–874) differs from house mouse Hif-2α (670–874) at 19 additional residues (Fig. 4A). This suggests that the loss of function effect of the T755M mutation in Hif-2α is only seen in the context of amino acid substitutions that are present in deer mouse Hif-2α (669–874). We prepared hybrid constructs in which specific regions of deer mouse Hif-2α (669–874) were inserted into the corresponding sequence of house mouse Hif-2α (residues 670–874) to determine which could confer sensitivity to the T755M mutation (Fig. 4A). We prepared five hybrid constructs, designated H1 to H5, that span the entire region of dissimilarity between deer mouse and house mouse Hif-2α and prepared T755 and M755 versions of each. The first two of these, H1 and H2, behave similarly to house mouse Hif-2α (670–874), that is, the T755M mutation preserves Cbp binding (Fig. 4B). In contrast, with H3, the T755M mutation impairs binding (Fig. 4C, lanes 4 and 5). In additional hybrids in which the deer mouse region of H3 was subdivided into two, producing H4 and H5 hybrids, we found that the T755M mutation maintains binding to Cbp in both cases, that is, the deleterious effect is lost (Fig. 4D). This suggests that multiple deer mouse amino acid substitutions in H3 (which includes T792A, R793V, S795P, T801S, C807G, G816S, Q821P, V826M) are necessary to confer sensitivity of Cbp binding in house mouse Hif-2α to the presence of methionine at residue 755. Under normoxia, prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylation inhibit Hif-2α (Fig. 5A), whereas under hypoxia, this inhibition is relieved (Fig. 5B, left). We find that the North American high-altitude deer mouse T755M mutation in Hif-2α produces a loss of function effect via impaired binding to Cbp (Fig. 5B, right). In vivo, the corresponding SNP in the Epas1 gene is associated with decreased levels of catecholamine biosynthetic gene expression in the adrenal gland (21Schweizer R.M. Velotta J.P. Ivy C.M. Jones M.R. Muir S.M. Bradburd G.S. Storz J.F. Scott G.R. Cheviron Z.A. Physiological and genomic evidence that selection on the transcription factor Epas1 has altered cardiovascular function in high-altitude deer mice.PLoS Genet. 2019; 15e1008420Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Because previous observations indicated that HIF-2α is required for catecholamine synthesis in sympathoadrenal cells (26Brown S.T. Kelly K.F. Daniel J.M. Nurse C.A. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-2 alpha is required for the development of the catecholaminergic phenotype of sympathoadrenal cells.J. Neurochem. 2009; 110: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), our results could provide a mechanistic explanation for this. The resulting vasodilation might lead to compensatory increased heart rate, which has been observed (21Schweizer R.M. Velotta J.P. Ivy C.M. Jones M.R. Muir S.M. Bradburd G.S. Storz J.F. Scott G.R. Cheviron Z.A. Physiological and genomic evidence that selection on the transcription factor Epas1 has altered cardiovascular function in high-altitude deer mice.PLoS Genet. 2019; 15e1008420Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Residue 755 is in a region of deer mouse Hif-2α that resides between the ODD domain and CTAD (Fig. 4A) and is not as highly conserved as either the ODD domain or CTAD. We find that the differences in the behavior of Thr and Met at this position are context dependent and seen only in deer mouse, but not house mouse, Hif-2α. This depends on a region in deer mouse Hif-2α (residues 792–826) that includes multiple amino acid substitutions. This may represent an example of intramolecular epistasis (27Storz J.F. Compensatory mutations and epistasis for protein function.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2018; 50: 18-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), somewhat analogous to the intramolecular epistasis that has been observed in high-altitude deer mouse hemoglobin (28Natarajan C. Inoguchi N. Weber R.E. Fago A. Moriyama H. Storz J.F. Epistasis among adaptive mutations in deer mouse hemoglobin.Science. 2013; 340: 1324-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We propose the following. Deer mouse and house mouse Hif-2α arose from a common ancestor (Fig. 5C). The ancestral M755 is indicated by “a”, whereas the other ancestral amino acids are indicated by “b”. Low-altitude deer mouse Hif-2α acquired amino acid substitutions that are indicated by “A” for M755T and “B” for the 19 other amino acid changes (Fig. 4A). The “AB” haplotype in deer mice is neutral under low-altitude conditions but is maladaptive at a high altitude. The “B” substitutions, however, provide a genetic background in which a reversion of “A” to the ancestral “a” allows the acquisition of a functional adaptive change in Hif-2α at high altitude (i.e., the “aB” haplotype). In a “b” background, interchange between “a” and “A” is otherwise neutral. No three-dimensional structure is available for the region in Hif-2α in which Thr-755 resides, and it is conceivable that it might be a disordered region. If so, Thr-755 of Hif-2α may bear similarity to residue 127 in human PHD2, which is in a poorly conserved, possibly disordered, region of PHD2 located between a zinc finger and the catalytic domain of PHD2. Tibetans harbor a C127S substitution in PHD2 that, in the context of the WT protein, is without an appreciable effect in vitro. However, in the context of a D4E mutation that is adjacent to the PHD2 zinc finger, the C127S substitution results in markedly impaired interaction of PHD2 with the HSP90 cochaperone p23, leading to loss of function (29Song D. Li L.S. Arsenault P.R. Tan Q. Bigham A.W. Heaton-Johnson K.J. Master S.R. Lee F.S. Defective Tibetan PHD2 binding to p23 links high altitude adaptation to altered oxygen sensing.J. Biol.

We propose that the high-altitude deer mouse T755M Hif-2α mutation and the human Tibetan C127S PHD2 substitution represent two independent adaptive amino acid changes in the HIF pathway that occur in potentially disordered regions of the respective proteins, produce loss of function in the context of other selective amino acid changes, and promote adaptation to the chronic hypoxia of high altitude.

https://openalex.org/W3133581243,"Suicide is a complex public health problem in contemporary societies. Macroeconomic downturns derived from the economic crisis have been found to be associated with growing suicide mortality in the United States and in Europe. The present work is aimed to assess the association between the recent economic downturns and suicide patterns using interrupted time series analysis and, particularly, adjusting this relationship by indicators of social cohesion and community values that might provide additional insights on the complex explanation of suicidal trends.We combined suicide, social and economic data extracted from the National Statistics Institute (INE), the Eurostat database, and the World Values Survey to assess the association between the socio-economic factors and trends in suicide rates. To study the association between the financial crisis and changes in suicide rates in Spain, we used interrupted time series analysis (ITSA).Our findings confirm that suicides increased after the 2011 recession, but remained moderately constant after the 2008 economic downturn. Suicides particularly increased after the 2011 recession in the 10-14, and 45-64 years old intervals between males and females, and apparently in older groups. However, during the 2008-2011 time period suicide rates decreased during working years (specifically among 40-44, 45-49, and 55-59 years old groups). Our results highlight the importance of social protection against unemployment and, to a lesser extent, social protection in disability and family, in reducing suicides, as well as the economic prosperity of the country.This result corroborates that the economic crisis has possibly impacted the growing suicide rates of the most vulnerable groups, but exclusively during the period characterised by economic cuts after the 2011 recession. This study highlights the need to implement tailored policies that protect these collectives against suicide."

The terminal cluster of the FeS relay is a [4Fe–4S] cluster, referred to as cluster N2 that is located at the interface of the NDUFS2 (NUCM) and NDUFS7 (NUKM) subunits. Note that we use the nomenclature for human complex I (for example, NDUFS2) for simplicity, rather than that specific to Y. lipolytica (for example, NUCM). Cluster N2 is positioned ∼12 Å above the quinone-binding site and ligated by four cysteine residues in NDUFS7, including an unusual, strained tandem cysteine pair (C85 and C86 in Y. lipolytica) (22Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Structure of the hydrophilic domain of respiratory complex I from Thermus thermophilus.Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). It donates electrons directly to ubiquinone and has received considerable attention due to its unique properties among the complex I FeS clusters, particularly its relatively high, pH-dependent reduction potential (23Ingledew W.J.

Surprisingly, other local mutations have been shown to deplete the N2 electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal while retaining a degree of quinone reductase activity. Conservative mutations in NDUFS2-R141 have been reported to produce partially active (∼40–50% of parental strain) complex I that appears to lack an N2 cluster, indicating the possibility of quinone reduction in the absence of a reduced N2 cluster by an unknown mechanism (25Grgic L.

Further interpretations of specific mutations in the second coordination sphere of N2 that impact enzyme turnover have been limited by the requirement for high-resolution structural data to pinpoint their inhibitory effects.

The arginine residue (NDUFS2-R121) in this motif is particularly intriguing, owing to its proximity to the N2 cluster (3.7 Å) and its unusual posttranslational modification: R121 has been shown to be the target of symmetrical ω-NG,NG dimethylation on its guanidino group (35Carroll J.

It has been suggested that dimethylation of this arginine residue is required for the formation of a 400 kDa assembly intermediate (36Rhein V.F. Carroll J. Ding S. Fearnley I.M. Walker J.E.

Furthermore, the hydrophobicity conferred by the two methyl groups may alter the reduction potential of the N2 cluster, decreasing the hydrogen-bonding capacity of the arginine side chain (36Rhein V.F.

Mutations in this unusual dimethylated arginine have been associated with the neurological disorder Leigh syndrome, suggested to stem from an altered reduction potential of the N2 cluster leading to a disruption of electron transfer to ubiquinone (38Fiedorczuk K.

The mechanisms by which R121 functions in either assembly or catalysis are yet unconfirmed; however, these studies highlight its unique role for complex I assembly/activity. NDUFS2-R121 mutants have been reported to show similar hallmarks to the N2-deficient R141 mutants mentioned above, including a decrease in membrane complex I content as well as a severe ablation of quinone reductase activity in membranes (30Tocilescu M.A. The Ubiquinone and Inhibitor Binding Pocket of Complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica: A Structure-Based Mutagenesis Study. Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main2009Google Scholar). The relatively conservative substitution of R121 to lysine (R121K) markedly decreased both the complex I content in mitochondrial membranes (to ∼40% of wild-type) and the specific activity (dNADH:DQ) to 24% of the parental strain. Importantly, no complex-I-specific EPR spectrum could be distinguished from NADH-reduced mitochondrial membranes, an effect not observed in other HRGXE-motif mutants. Whether this effect was reflective of the low complex I content in the mitochondrial membranes or a diminished N2 signal directly was not established (30Tocilescu M.A. The Ubiquinone and Inhibitor Binding Pocket of Complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica: A Structure-Based Mutagenesis Study. Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main2009Google Scholar). While R121 is highly conserved across the majority of complex I species, it is replaced with a threonine residue in Thermus thermophilus, the first organism for which a crystal structure of complex I was obtained (22Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Structure of the hydrophilic domain of respiratory complex I from Thermus thermophilus.Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar, 40Baradaran R. Berrisford J.M. Minhas G.S. Sazanov L.A. Crystal structure of the entire respiratory complex I.Nature. 2013; 494: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the canonical EPR signature of the reduced N2 cluster has not been observed in membrane particles or the hydrophilic domain of complex I from T. thermophilus upon reduction by NADH (41Hinchliffe P. Carroll J. Sazanov L.A. Identification of a novel subunit of respiratory complex I from Thermus thermophilus.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4413-4420Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 42Meinhardt S.W. Wang D.C. Hon-Nami K. Yagi T. Oshima T. Ohnishi T. Studies on the NADH-menaquinone oxidoreductase segment of the respiratory chain in Thermus thermophilus HB-8.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1360-1368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This has led to suggestions that the absence of R121 (or the presence of threonine) in the second coordination sphere of N2 in the T. thermophilus enzyme may either decrease the reduction potential of the cluster below that of NADH or alter its spin state such that the cluster is not detected under standard EPR measurement conditions (43Hirst J. Roessler M.M. Energy conversion, redox catalysis and generation of reactive oxygen species by respiratory complex I.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1857: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Determining the relationships between the dimethylated R121 residue and cluster N2 should give insights into the role of this residue, in catalysis and/or assembly. Here, we used two variants of NDUFS2-R121 to investigate its functional and structural role in Y. lipolytica complex I. We combine biochemical characterization of R121 mutants with cryo-EM structural analysis to show that R121 mutants are capable of native-like assembly but suffer from an absolute loss of quinone reductase activity. EPR spectroscopy and examination of the local structure confirm the absence of a functional N2 cluster, with profound effects on the cysteine residues in the N2 primary coordination sphere, as well as critical ubiquinone-binding residues. Our data confirms that electron transfer to ubiquinone cannot occur in the absence of an N2 cluster, despite the otherwise native-like structural assembly, and suggests why R121 is so critical for the function of the complex. Two variants of NDUFS2-R121 were created by site-directed mutagenesis: the R121M and R121K variants. Previous work on the R121K variant reported depletion of the complex I content in Y. lipolytica membranes (30Tocilescu M.A. The Ubiquinone and Inhibitor Binding Pocket of Complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica: A Structure-Based Mutagenesis Study. Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main2009Google Scholar), suggesting that R121 mutants result in decreased complex I stability. Our initial characterization was therefore focused on establishing the structural integrity of both the membrane-bound and detergent-solubilized enzymes. Figure 1A shows a blue native (BN)-PAGE analysis of wild-type (we use the term wild-type (WT) to refer to the parental GB10 strain) and mutant Y. lipolytica membranes solubilized with n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM). Complex-I-containing bands were identified by in-gel activity staining for NADH oxidation. In all cases, the BN-PAGE clearly shows a band at approximately 900 kDa that is positive for NADH oxidation activity, demonstrating that complex I is present and intact in membranes from both variants. The relative intensities of the bands for the R121M and R121K variants suggest a lower complex I content than for wild-type, most obviously for R121K. The decrease in complex I content was quantified using the rate of APAD+ reduction by dNADH, a specific substrate for the complex I flavin site, which is not expected to be affected by the mutations (Fig. 1B). dNADH:APAD+ activity indicated that the complex I contents were ∼40% and 25% for R121M and R121K, respectively, relative to wild-type, corroborating the observations from BN-PAGE. These results are in line with those previously obtained for R121K (30Tocilescu M.A. The Ubiquinone and Inhibitor Binding Pocket of Complex I from Yarrowia lipolytica: A Structure-Based Mutagenesis Study. Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main2009Google Scholar), where complex I content was seen to decrease to ∼40% of the wild-type. Therefore, although it is clear that mutations of R121 impair the assembly and/or stability of complex I, a level of intact enzyme is still present and available for study. The quinone reductase activities, measured with the complex I-specific substrate dNADH, showed extensive loss of the activity in both the R121M and R121K variants, in comparison to wild-type (Fig. 1C). The minor rates observed in the mutants were insensitive to piericidin A, a complex I inhibitor and Q analogue, clearly demonstrating a lack of any specific catalytic activity, despite the apparent structural integrity of the enzymes themselves. To gain further insight into their stability, the R121 variants were purified from mitochondrial membranes and their functional capacities characterized. Both variants exhibited substantial levels of aggregation in the size-exclusion chromatographic traces. However, analyses of the monomeric peak fractions by BN-PAGE and SDS-PAGE revealed enzymes that closely match the wild-type enzyme. Both Coomassie and in-gel activity staining of BN-PAGE analyses (Fig. 2A) indicate a homogeneous preparation of intact complex I, with a functional flavin site. SDS-PAGE analyses revealed near-identical protein compositions in preparations of the wild-type and mutant enzymes (Fig. 2B). An additional band was present at ∼60 kDa that was not present in previously analyzed wild-type Y. lipolytica complex I (44Varghese F. Atcheson E. Bridges H.R. Hirst J. Characterization of clinically identified mutations in NDUFV1, the flavin-binding subunit of respiratory complex I, using a yeast model system.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2015; 24: 6350-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), perhaps supported by inclusion of phospholipids in the affinity chromatography buffer. Tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS) of trypsin digested bands excised from the gel confirmed (with >95% confidence) that this band was due to alternative NADH dehydrogenase (NDH2) copurifying with complex I. The degree of NDH2 contamination in even the wild-type enzyme was highly variable among different preparations (compare the two wild-type samples in Fig. 2B) and was reflected in rates of NADH:DQ activity for the R121 variants, which showed a substantial piericidin-A-insensitive rate of NADH (rather than dNADH) oxidation (Fig. 2C). As both NDUFS2-R121 variants exhibit matching subunit composition and functional effects, further functional and structural analyses focused on NDUFS2-R121M, owing to the highe"

Whole-blood transcriptome analysis revealed that the gene expression was altered in HBB2-targeted when compared with WT rabbits. And the highly expressed genes in HBB2-targeted rabbits were enriched in lipid and iron metabolism, innate immunity, and hematopoietic processes.

Thalassemia is a heterogeneous group of inherited blood disorders characterized by reduced hemoglobin synthesis (1Cohen A.R. Galanello R. Pennell D.J. Cunningham M.J. Vichinsky E. Thalassemia.Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program. 2004; : 14-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). β-thalassemia major is its severe form and caused by mutations in the HBB gene and reduction or absence of β-globin chain synthesis. As a result, the α-globin chains are free and unpaired; they aggregate and precipitate within red cells and consequently cause ineffective erythropoiesis and severe anemia (2Cao A. Galanello R. Beta-thalassemia.Genet. Med. 2010; 12: 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), with complications such as immune defects (3Farmakis D. Giakoumis A.

Disord. 2003; 3: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). To date, over 200 different HBB gene mutations have been identified that cause β-thalassemia. Most of those mutations are single nucleotide substitutions, deletions, or insertions of oligonucleotides leading to the frameshift (5Danjou F. Anni F. Galanello R. Beta-thalassemia: From genotype to phenotype.Haematologica. 2011; 96: 1573-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). At present, the most effective treatment for thalassemia is allogenic bone marrow transplantation, but fully matched donors are rare (6Baronciani D. Angelucci E. Potschger U. Gaziev J. Yesilipek A.

Despite chronic blood transfusion and iron chelation therapy remarkably improving the duration and quality of life of patients with thalassemia in industrialized countries, the transfusion-related complications, including high rates of alloimmunization and blood-borne infectious sequelae, become a major source of morbidity (7Vichinsky E.

Besides, the high-cost treatment is not a feasible option in many developing countries where thalassemia is a common disease. Therefore, the need for the development of new curative approaches for thalassemia is urgent. Given the complex clinical and molecular mechanisms of β-thalassemia, animal models are essential for understanding its pathophysiological and hemoglobinopathy mechanisms and validating future therapeutic strategies in vivo. So far, mouse was the only animal used for mimicking human thalassemia. A group of thalassemia mouse models have been generated; these mouse thalassemia models display many features of the β-hemoglobinopathies and provide enormous insight into the mechanisms of gene regulation (8McColl B. Vadolas J. Animal models of beta-hemoglobinopathies: Utility and limitations.J. Blood Med. 2016; 7: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Spontaneous and insertional disruption Hbb-b1 gene deletion mice have been characterized (9Skow L.C. Burkhart B.A. Johnson F.M. Popp R.A. Popp D.M. Goldberg S.Z. Anderson W.F. Barnett L.B. Lewis S.E.

The heterozygotes show very mild thalassemia comparable with human patients. While homozygotes are severely anemic and lethal. The transgenic mouse models containing mutant human β-globin genomic fragments were also reported (12Opazo J.C. Hoffmann F.G. Storz J.F.

Notably, the rabbit is another standard experimental model for the study of various human diseases. Compared with mice, rabbits have unique features of physiology, anatomy, and genetics and more similarities with humans (14Shiomi M. Rabbit as a model for the study of human diseases.in: Houdebine L.-M. Fan J. Rabbit Biotechnology. Springer Netherlands, Dordrecht2009: 49-63Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although transgenic rabbits have been developed and contribute greatly to the study of lipid metabolism (15Araki M. Fan J. Challah M. Bensadoun A. Yamada N. Honda K. Watanabe T. Transgenic rabbits expressing human lipoprotein lipase.Cytotechnology. 2000; 33: 93-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cardiovascular (16Peng X. Transgenic rabbit models for studying human cardiovascular diseases.Comp. Med. 2012; 62: 472-479PubMed Google Scholar) and infectious diseases (17Peng X. Knouse J.A. Hernon K.M. Rabbit models for studying human infectious diseases.Comp. Med. 2015; 65: 499-507PubMed Google Scholar), the lack of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) hampers the gene targeting of rabbit and consequently limits the various applications of rabbit model. The advent of customized nucleases, such as ZFN (18Flisikowska T. Thorey I.S. Offner S. Ros F. Lifke V. Zeitler B. Rottmann O. Vincent A. Zhang L. Jenkins S. Niersbach H. Kind A.J. Gregory P.D.

Tang C. Fan N. Lai L. Generation of multi-gene knockout rabbits using the Cas9/gRNA system.Cell Regen. (Lond.). 2014; 3: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) technologies, has changed the circumstance of gene editing. In combination with embryo microinjection, these customized nucleases have been efficiently used for generation of various gene editing rabbits with different applications. Remarkably, the comparative genomic analysis revealed that the β-globin gene cluster of rabbits is close to that of humans and contains three functional globin genes: the embryonic gene ε-globin gene (HBE), fetal γ-globin gene (HBG), and adult β-globin gene (HBB2), implying that the rabbit can be a better model to study human β-thalassemia. As a proof of concept, herein we successfully generated the first β-thalassemia rabbit model using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated insertion/deletion(indel) mutagenesis, and typical phenotypes of β-thalassemia were characterized in the HBB2-targeted rabbit models. The β-thalassemia rabbit models also harbored the various abnormalities of lipid and iron metabolism and innate immunity, in addition to hematopoietic defects. Two gRNAs targeting the exon I and exon II of the rabbit HBB2 gene were designed and synthesized (Fig. 1A) respectively. Single-stranded annealing (SSA) assay was performed to test the cleavage efficiency of the two gRNAs, Cas9/gRNA-expressing and SSA EGFP reporter vectors were constructed and transfected into HEK293 cells, flow cytometry was applied to analyze the recovery of EGFP gene, and the results indicated that gRNA1 exhibited higher cleavage activity (Fig. S1). Then we validate the targeting efficiency of the two gRNAs on endogenous HBB2 gene by transfecting Cas9/gRNA-expressing plasmids into rabbit fetal fibroblast cells. The T7E1 assay showed that gRNA1 was more effective, which was consistent with the SSA assay result (Fig. 1B). To optimize the concentration of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA, capped polyadenylated Cas9 mRNA and gRNA were produced by in vitro transcription and microinjected into one-cell-stage embryos with different concentrations, the injected embryos were cultured for 5 days to the blastocyst stage for testing the targeting efficiency. In comparison with the controls, the microinjection of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA showed no significant impact on the development of embryos (Fig. 1C). The T7E1 assay showed an efficient gene mutation in the injected blastocysts, even at the lowest concentration of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA (100/10 ng/μl) (Fig. 1D). Single-embryo sequencing was applied to identify mutations in the injected embryos, the results indicated that gRNA1 was more effective and the higher concentration of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA led to more biallelic mutagenesis efficiency (Fig. 1E). Given the higher effectivity of gRNA1, we initially applied the microinjection of a high concentration of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA1 (200/20 ng/μl) into the cytoplasm of one-cell rabbit embryos. A total of 153 injected embryos were transferred into the oviducts of ten surrogate rabbits (Fig. 2A). After 1-month gestation, only three of the surrogate rabbits developed to term and delivered four stillborn fetuses. Genotyping by PCR and sequencing indicated that all these four stillborn fetuses showed biallelic mutagenesis (Fig. 2B). The fact that human patients with the homozygous forms of β0-thalassemia are lethal in the untreated state and the mice homozygous for the Hbb-b1 and Hbb-b2 double KOs are stillborn or die within hours after birth, implying that the biallelic mutation of the rabbit adult β-globin gene was lethal. Therefore, to achieve the heterozygous HBB2-targeted rabbits, we then applied a low concentration of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA1 (100/10 ng/μl) for embryo microinjection. A total of 112 injected embryos were transferred into seven surrogates (Fig. 2A). Two of them successfully developed to term and gave birth to four rabbit pups (F0, one male, three females) after 30 days’ gestation (Fig. 2C). Genomic DNA was extracted from the ear tissues and blood of the newborns for genotyping. Through T-A cloning and Sanger sequencing, HBB2 gene mutations were detected in all four newborns carrying indels at the expected target locus (Fig. 2B). All of the four rabbits exhibited genotypic mosaicism, which contained both wild-type HBB2 allele and various prorations of the mutant allele (F0-5, −7 bp; F0-6, −10 bp; F0-7, −1 bp; F0-8, −6 bp). The mutant prorations of the skin and blood were also detected and showed to be heterogeneous (Fig. 2D). In consideration of the failed generation of homozygous HBB2-targeted rabbits and high frequency of off-target mutagenesis reported in various animals and cell lines, we sought to detect the off-target effect of CRISPR/Cas9. The potential off-target sites were predicted using CRISPOR (21Canver M.C. Haeussler M. Bauer D.E. Orkin S.H. Sanjana N.E. Shalem O. Yuan G.-C. Zhang F. Concordet J.-P. Pinello L. Integrated computational guide design, execution, and analysis of arrayed and pooled CRISPR genome editing experiments.bioRxiv. 2017; https://doi.org/10.1101/125245Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The 48 highest-scored potential off-target sites of the HBB2 gRNA1 were selected for T7E1 cleavage assay (Fig. S2) and no cleavage was detected (Fig. 2E), indicating the high fidelity of the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. Given the genotypic mosaicism of the HBB2-targeted founders, germline transmission of the mutant HBB2 allele is crucial for the establishment of β-thalassemia rabbit model. Initially, we mated the male founder F0-7 with the other three female founders at the age of 8 months. Unfortunately, the F0-5 rabbit died of childbirth, F0-6 gave birth of two stillborns, and F0-8 was not successfully pregnant. Then, we mated the male founder F0-7 with three female WT rabbits and obtained a total of 15 offspring (F1). Genotyping and T7E1 assay indicated that five of them carried the same mutant HBB2 allele (−1 bp) with that of the founder F0-7(Fig. 3A). The blood was collected from the WT, F0, and F1 HBB2-targeted rabbits for examination of the hematological characteristic. In comparison with the WT rabbits, both F0 and F1 showed decreased hemoglobin concentration (Hb), hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), red blood cell (RBC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and RBC counts, which accompanied by increased red cell distribution width (RDW), reticulocytes (RET), uric acid, and total bilirubin (Fig. 3B). All these changes were similar to the relative parameters of human patients with β-thalassemia. The morphology of the red cells was directly observed under microscopy and blood smear treatment (Fig. 3C, Fig. S3). Frequent acanthocytes were found in the blood of both F0 and F1 heterozygous rabbits. The blood smear results showed that the HBB2-targeted rabbits contained marked macrocytic and microcytic hypochromic red cells, target cells, schistocytes, and burr cells. Pappenheimer bodies, which were derived from precipitated alpha-globin chains and granules of iron, also presented in the RBCs. All these characteristics indicated that the HBB2-targeted rabbits exhibited typical pathological features of β-thalassemia and the phenotypes of F1 heterozygous rabbits were apparently more severe than that of F0 rabbits. Furthermore, histological analyses were performed in the spleen, liver, and kidney from WT and HBB2-targeted rabbits. The result showed that the spleens of the HBB2-targeted rabbits display a massive expansion of red pulps and dramatic pooling of sinusoidal erythrocytes (Fig. S3). Blue-purple staining showed marked iron deposits in the spleen, liver, and kidney of the HBB2-targeted rabbits; it is similar to that of human patients in which the abnormal stimulation of extramedullary erythropoiesis induces spontaneous iron overload (Fig. 3C). To further investigate the transcriptional differences between the WT and HBB2-targeted rabbits, total RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood of two F0, two F1, and four WT rabbits to synthesize the cDNA libraries and was used for RNA sequencing. A total of 8236 genes was detected, the majority of genes were fewer than ten copies, and only a small proportion of genes were highly expressed. In comparison with WT, HBB2-targeted rabbits harbored more low-expressing genes in the blood (Fig. 4A); however, most of the highly expressed genes were overexpressed in HBB2-targeted rabbits (Fig. 4B). We found that HBA was highly expressed in the blood of F0 and F1rabbits, whereas HBB2 was overexpressed in F0 rabbits, the expression levels of HBA and HBB2 resulted in the different anemic features of F0 and F1 rabbits. GO classification indicated that the highly expressed genes were involved in biological process, metabolism, cell organization, and biogenesis (Fig. 4C). We then applied DESeq2 (22Love M.I. Huber W. Anders S. Moderated estimation of fold change and dispersion for RNA-seq data with DESeq2.Genome Biol. 2014; 15: 550Crossref PubMed Scopus (22668) Google Scholar) to investigate the differential gene expression patterns of WT and HBB2-targeted rabbits. Gene set enrichment and principal component analysis indicated that the WT and HBB2-targeted rabbits featured distinctly different blood transcriptome patterns (Fig. 5A, Fig. S4A). In comparison with WT (p < 0.01), 130 genes were overexpressed in HBB2-targeted rabbits, 19 and 299 genes were highly expressed exclusively in F0 and F1, respectively. Seven of the lower-expressed genes were identified in HBB2-targeted rabbits, 58 and 10 genes were found in F0 and F1, respectively (Fig. 5B, Fig. S4B). Further gene interaction network analyses by GeneMANIA showed that the spectrin alpha chain, erythrocytic 1 (SPTA1) gene was highly coexpressed with hemoglobin genes (Fig. S4C), which indicated that the HBB2-targeted F0 rabbits possessed great erythrocytic repopulating ability. GO enrichment analysis (p < 0.05) showed that the highly expressed genes in HBB2-targeted rabbits were enriched in lipid metabolism and mitophagy, such as “GO:0033211 adiponectin-activated signaling pathway,” “GO:0044539 long-chain fatty acid import,” and “GO:0000422 mitophagy.” Furthermore, the genes highly expressed in F1 were mostly encircled in hematopoietic processes, such as “GO:0030218 erythrocyte differentiation,” “GO:0006783 heme biosynthetic process,” and “GO:0016226 iron sulfur cluster assembly” (Fig. S4D). We identified that 14 genes enriched in the hematopoiesis GO term were significantly overexpressed in the blood of F1 (Fig. 5C). Thalassemia is associated with several immune deficiencies, in addition to anemia. A recent study demonstrated that innate immune cells, neutrophils in particular, are defective in human patients with β-thalassemia (23Siwaponanan P. Siegers J.Y. Ghazali R. Ng T. McColl B. Ng G.Z. Sutton P. Wang N. Ooi I. Thiengtavor C. Fucharoen S. Chaichompoo P. Svasti S. Wijburg O. Vadolas J. Reduced PU.1 expression underlies aberrant neutrophil maturation and function in beta-thalassemia mice and patients.Blood. 2017; 129: 3087-3099Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that nine genes (TRIM11, FGR, S100A9, S100A12, FBXO9, TRIM10, ANXA1, S100A9, and ITGB2) related to innate immune response and neutrophil chemotaxis were expressed differently in the HBB2-targeted rabbits (Fig. 5D). A close examination of these differentially expressed genes after filtering at an adjusted p-value <0.01 (FDR < 0.1) and log2-fold-change >2. We also identified that five genes (HMBS (24Martinez di Montemuros F. Di Pierro E. Biolcati G. Rocchi E. Bissolotti E. Tavazzi D. Fiorelli G.

Genet. 2013; 22: 2119-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) associated with various blood disorders were overexpressed in the HBB2-targeted rabbits (Fig. 5E). Gene interaction network analysis indicated that these genes interact with each other intimately (Fig. S4E). Animal models are crucial for understanding the mechanisms of hemoglobinopathies and validating future therapeutic strategies. To date, the only available β-thalassemia animal models are mouse models generated by KO β-globin genes or transgenic human mutant β-globin genes (8McColl B. Vadolas J. Animal models of beta-hemoglobinopathies: Utility and limitations.J. Blood Med. 2016; 7: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Although these mouse models have improved our understanding of hemoglobinopathy, the gaps between mice and humans limit the knowledge from preclinical studies to the clinic. To overcome this limitation, here we successfully established a HBB2-targeted rabbit models by coinjection of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA into rabbit zygotes, which accurately matched the mutation pattern of human thalassemia patients. The hematological and histological analyses indicated that both the HBB2-targeted F0 and F1 rabbits exhibited typical characteristics of β-thalassemia clinical features. Moreover, the blood transcriptome analysis indicated that in addition to hematopoiesis, the HBB2-targeted rabbits exhibited innate immunity and lipid metabolism abnormalities, which are major concerns in patients with β-thalassemia (30Borgna-Pignatti C. Gamberini M.R. Complications of thalassemia major and their treatment.Expert Rev. Hematol. 2011; 4: 353-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Rabbits have been extensively used in the research of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. For genotypic aspect, the rabbit β-globin gene cluster contains only one adult β-globin gene that is similar to human. Hence, rabbits are supposed to be a more suitable model for thalassemia disease than mice. However, due to the unavailability of pluripotent stem cells with ability to result in germline chimera and the low efficiency of somatic nuclear transfer in rabbits, which are the two classical approaches for generating gene targeted animals, the HBB2-targeted rabbits have not been established yet. Recent advances in genome editing have greatly prompted the generation of gene-targeted rabbits (20Yan Q. Zhang Q. Yang H. Zou Q. Tang C. Fan N. Lai L. Generation of multi-gene knockout rabbits using the Cas9/gRNA system.Cell Regen. (Lond.). 2014; 3: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). By utilizing NHEJ to repair the double-strand breaks induced by Cas9/gRNA, we successfully achieved gene-edited rabbits harboring indel mutation in the HBB2 gene, which mimicked the genotype of most β-thalassemia patients (2Cao A. Galanello R. Beta-thalassemia.Genet. Med. 2010; 12: 61-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Compared with the previously reported mouse models, which were generated by large DNA fragment deletion, our established HBB2-targeted rabbit models are applicable for preclinical testing of gene correction in vivo. For technological aspect, as reported in mice (31Wang H. Yang H. Shivalila C.S. Dawlaty M.M. Cheng A.W. Zhang F. Jaenisch R. One-step generation of mice carrying mutations in multiple genes by CRISPR/Cas-mediated genome engineering.Cell. 2013; 153: 910-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2370) Google Scholar) and other animals (32Guo X. Zhang T. Hu Z. Zhang Y. Shi Z. Wang Q. Cui Y. Wang F. Zhao H. Chen Y. Efficient RNA/Cas9-mediated genome editing in Xenopus tropicalis.Development. 2014; 141: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), the efficiency of Cas9/gRNA-mediated gene targeting is associated with the concentration of injected Cas9 mRNA and gRNA, especially for the biallelic targeting efficiency. In particular, targeting the lethal gene is of vital importance, as in this study. We initially failed to obtain HBB2-targeted rabbits by embryo injection of a high concentration of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA (200/20 ng/μl). To avoid biallelic targeting, which is lethal for rabbits, we then used a lower concentration of Cas9 mRNA and gRNA (100/10 ng/μl) and successfully generated four HBB2-targeted chimeric rabbits with a variety of indel mutations from1 bp to 10 bp. By mating the F0 chimeric rabbits with wild-type ones, we achieved five F1 HBB2-targeted rabbits with deletion of 1 bp. Although the off-target effect (33Fu Y. Foden J.A. Khayter C. Maeder M.L. Reyon D. Joung J.K. Sander J.D. High-frequency off-target mutagenesis induced by CRISPR-Cas nucleases in human cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar) of CRISPR is a great concern and has been frequently reported (34Zhang X.H. Tee L.Y. Wang X.G. Huang Q.S. Yang S.H. Off-target effects in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering.Mol. Ther. Nucleic Acids. 2015; 4e264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), we did not detect off-target mutagenesis in the HBB2-targeted rabbits by silico predictions. For phenotype aspect, examination of peripheral blood smears demonstrated marked anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, and target cells were presented in both the HBB2-targeted F0 and F1 rabbits, which was similar to the red cell morphology in β-thalassemia patients. Hematological analyses indicated that the heterozygous F1 rabbits exhibited typical characteristics of β-thalassemia, and the chimeric F0 rabbits showed a mild phenotype of anemia, which is majorly due to the rescue of wild-type genotypic hematopoietic stem cells. However, histological analyses suggested that unlike most untransfused β-thalassemia patients, the HBB2-targeted rabbits develop spontaneous iron deposits in the spleen at early stage, which may be useful to study the pathophysiology of iron overload in different organs and develop pharmacological-based therapies. For transcriptome aspect, blood transcriptome analysis indicated that the HBB2-targeted rabbits featured different transcriptional patterns from WT. HBA was highly expressed in both F0 and F1 rabbits, whereas HBB2 was overexpressed in F0 rabbits. We identified 14 of the genes overexpressed in the blood of F1 related to hematopoiesis, in which seven genes showed no difference in F0 and WT. Furthermore, gene interaction analysis showed that SPTA1, an erythroid specific marker (35Wolgast L.R. Cannizzarro L.A. Ramesh K.H. Xue X. Wang D. Bhattacharyya P.K. Gong J.Z. McMahon C. Albanese J.M. Sunkara J.L. Ratech H. Spectrin isoforms: Differential expression in normal hematopoiesis and alterations in neoplastic bone marrow disorders.Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 2011; 136: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), was coexpressed with other hemoglobin genes in F0, this might imply that the normal hematopoietic stem cells in the chimeric rabbits possessed greater differentiation tendency toward RBCs to make up for the function loss of HBB2 gene, and therefore F0 rabbits exhibited milder symptoms than F1 counterparts. This also reminds us that β-thalassemia could be a suitable disease candidate of gene therapy through correcting the mutant HBB2 gene, where the correction of small ratio of cells is sufficient to relieve the symptoms. Patients with thalassemia suffer from various complications such as immune abnormalities, metabolic and endocrinologic disorders. Here, we found that the genes differently expressed in HBB2-targeted rabbits were significantly enriched in lipid and iron metabolism, protein translation, innate immunity, and hematopoietic processes, the genes related to hematopoiesis and immunity have also been identified in patients with various blood disorders. Taken together, here we described the first HBB2-targeted rabbits, which accurately recapitulated the typical genotypic and phenotypic features of β-thalassemia patients. This model will advance the further study of pathological mechanisms and development of new therapeutic strategies for β-thalassemia and related complications. The rabbits used in the experiments were the New Zealand rabbit strain and obtained from the Center for Laboratory Animal Sciences of Southern Medical University. All experiments were performed according to the guidelines for animal experiments of the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (China) and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Committee of the Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Two sgRNAs targeting the rabbit HBB2 exons were designed (sgRNA1 targeting ExonI and sgRNA2 targeting ExonII) according to the following website: http://crispr.mit.edu/. The sequences of the sgRNAs were as follows: sgRNA1 (GGTCACTGCCCTGTGGGGCAAGG) and sgRNA2 (GGTTCTTCGAGTCCTTTGGGG). Two complementary DNA oligos of gRNA were synthesized for each target site. The two DNA oligos (10 μM) were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min and annealed at room temperature before they were cloned between two BbsI sites of the pUC57-T7 vector (Addgene ID: 51306). Subsequent sequencing analysis was performed to select the correct gRNA that contained the target site sequence. The template of gRNA for in vitro transcription was PCR products obtained from gRNA vectors by using the primer pair (T7-F: 5′-GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATA-3′; T7-R: 5′-AAAAAAAGCACCGACTCGGTGCCAC-3′) with a high-fidelity enzyme (Takara). The gRNAs were transcribed using a T7 High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit (NEB) and purified using an miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The Cas9 expression vector was linearized using NotI and transcribed using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 Kit (Ambion) to produce capped Cas9 RNA. The concentration and quality of the synthesized Cas9 mRNA and gRNA were measured using NanoDrop 2000 and agarose gel (1%) electrophoresis, respectively. The female New Zealand White rabbits (6–8 months old) were superovulated with FSH (100 IU). Approximately 3 days later, the rabbits were mated and then injected with 100 IU human chorionic gonadotrophin. The day after mating, the donor rabbits were sacrificed, and embryos were collected from the oviducts. Various concentrations of Cas9/gRNA mRNA were microinjected into the pronuclear (PN)-stage embryos. Approximately 35 to 40 injected embryos were transferred into the oviduct of a recipient rabbit. Surplus embryos were cultured to blastocyst stage for in vitro embryo development testing, and evaluation of gene targeting efficiency in Cas9/gRNA injected embryos was conducted. The injected embryos were collected at the blastocyst stage. DNA of each embryo was extracted using a lysis buffer (1% NP40 plus 60 ng/μl protein K) for T7E1 assay and sequencing to detect the targeting efficiency. The genomic DNA of newborn rabbits was extracted using a DNA extraction kit (Takara) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PCR primer sequences used for mutation detection were as follows: rHBBF (GGGTCTGGGAGATACATAGAAGGAA) and rHBBR (CTTCCCATTCTAAACAACACCCTGA). The PCR products were gel purified and cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara). At least 10 T-A clones were used for sequencing to obtain the detailed information of gene mutation. Potential off-target cleavage sites of sgRNA1 were predicted using CRISPOR online software (http://crispor.tefor.net/). The top 48 HBB2-sgRNA1 potential off-target sites were identified. Approximately 500 to 700 bp genomic fragments containing the potential off-target site were amplified using PCR. The PCR products were confirmed using T7E1 enzyme digestion and sequenced to identify any mutations. Approximately 2 ml of blood samples was collected from the auricular vein of WT and HBB2-targeted rabbits. The 2 μl of blood samples was used for peripheral blood smears according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Giemsa Stain Kit, ZBS9-BA-4017). The blood smears were stained with Wright–Giemsa and examined under a Nikon microscope. Hemoglobin electrophoresis test was performed following the instructions of the CAPILLARYS HEMOGLOBIN(E) kit. A total of 18 μl of blood of each sample and five volumes of diluted reagent were added to the well of the cuvette and mixed thoroughly. The hemoglobin profiles of the samples were measured using a CAPILLARYS 2 FLEX-PIERCING instrument (Sebia). The rest of the blood was used for hematological analyses. The Hb, HCT, MCH, RBCs, MCV, RBC counts, RDW, and RET for each sample were measured by following the manufacturer’s instructions (Sysmex XN-9000). Uric acid and total bilirubin for each sample were determined using the Roche cobas 8000 analyzer series. The tissues of the liver, lung, heart, spleen, and kidney from the WT and HBB2-targeted rabbits (euthanized at 6 months of age) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4) for 48 h, then embedded in paraffin wax, and sectioned for slides. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and Perls staining (Leagene DJ0001) were performed separately using standard protocols. The samples were then viewed under a Nikon microscope. Blood samples were collected using auricular venipuncture from four 6-month-old wild-type rabbits. HBB2-targeted founders F0-7, F0-8, and the offsprings F1-1 and F1-2. Total RNA was isolated using the RNAprep Pure Hi-Blood Kit (TIANGEN). cDNA libraries were prepared from high-quality RNA by using an Illumina TruSeq RNA sample prep kit following the manufacturer’s instruction (Illumina). Individual RNA-seq libraries were sequenced in triplicate at 100 bp/sequence paired-end reads by using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina, TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3, cBot, and TruSeq BS Kit v3). The clean reads were quantified using Salmon. The cDNA reference file came from Ensembl. Transcripts per million normalized counts were used for the transcriptome profile analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed using DEseq2. All data are contained within the article and the Supporting information. This article contains supporting information.

https://openalex.org/W3130495849,"Psychrobacter cryohalolentis strain K5T is a Gram-negative organism first isolated in 2006. It has a complex O-antigen that contains, in addition to l-rhamnose and d-galactose, two diacetamido- and a triacetamido-sugar. The biochemical pathways for the production of these unusual sugars are presently unknown. Utilizing the published genome sequence of the organism, we hypothesized that the genes 0612, 0638, and 0637 encode for a 4,6-dehydratase, an aminotransferase, and an N-acetyltransferase, respectively, which would be required for the biosynthesis of one of the diacetamido-sugars, 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose, starting from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Here we present functional and structural data on the proteins encoded by the 0638 and 0637 genes. The kinetic properties of these enzymes were investigated by a discontinuous HPLC assay. An X-ray crystallographic structure of 0638, determined in its external aldimine form to 1.3 Å resolution, demonstrated the manner in which the UDP ligand is positioned into the active site. It is strikingly different from that previously observed for PglE from Campylobacter jejuni, which functions on the same substrate. Four X-ray crystallographic structures were also determined for 0637 in various complexed states at resolutions between 1.3 and 1.55 Å. Remarkably, a tetrahedral intermediate mimicking the presumed transition state was trapped in one of the complexes. The data presented herein confirm the hypothesized functions of these enzymes and provide new insight into an unusual sugar biosynthetic pathway in Gram-negative bacteria. We also describe an efficient method for acetyl-CoA synthesis that allowed us to overcome its prohibitive cost for this analysis. Psychrobacter cryohalolentis strain K5T is a Gram-negative organism first isolated in 2006. It has a complex O-antigen that contains, in addition to l-rhamnose and d-galactose, two diacetamido- and a triacetamido-sugar. The biochemical pathways for the production of these unusual sugars are presently unknown. Utilizing the published genome sequence of the organism, we hypothesized that the genes 0612, 0638, and 0637 encode for a 4,6-dehydratase, an aminotransferase, and an N-acetyltransferase, respectively, which would be required for the biosynthesis of one of the diacetamido-sugars, 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose, starting from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. Here we present functional and structural data on the proteins encoded by the 0638 and 0637 genes. The kinetic properties of these enzymes were investigated by a discontinuous HPLC assay.

The bacterium Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5T is a Gram-negative organism that was first isolated in 2006 from the permafrost in the Kolyma lowland, Siberia, Russia (1Bakermans C. Ayala-Del-Rio H.L. Ponder M.A. Vishnivetskaya T. Gilichinsky D. Thomashow M.F. Tiedje J.M. Psychrobacter cryohalolentis sp. nov. and Psychrobacter arcticus sp. nov., isolated from Siberian permafrost.Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2006; 56: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It belongs to the genus Psychrobacter, which includes aerobic organisms that range from psychrophilic to psychrotolerant. These organisms are also halotolerant. Strikingly, the growth temperature range for P. cryohalolentis K5T is between –10 and 30oC (1Bakermans C. Ayala-Del-Rio H.L. Ponder M.A. Vishnivetskaya T. Gilichinsky D. Thomashow M.F. Tiedje J.M.

Microbiol. 2006; 56: 1285-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The name Psychrobacter, itself, was first proposed in 1986 with the isolation of Psychrobacter immobilis (2Juni E. Heym G.A. Psychrobacter immobilis gen. Nov., sp. nov.: Genospecies composed of gram-negative, aerobic, oxidase-positive coccobacilli.Int. J. Syst.

Since 1986, additional strains of Psychrobacter have been discovered as more research is directed toward understanding the ecology of polar and marine habitats. Although still considered opportunistic pathogens, some related strains of P. cryohalolentis have been isolated, for example, from human blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, and cutaneous sources (5Caspar Y. Recule C. Pouzol P. Lafeuillade B. Mallaret M.R. Maurin M. Croize J. Psychrobacter arenosus bacteremia after blood transfusion, France.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2013; 19: 1118-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A number of clinical cases have been reported, including the recent infection of a 26-year-old man after suffering a hand laceration while crabbing in Puget Sound (6Bonwitt J. Tran M. Droz A. Gonzalez A. Glover W.A. Psychrobacter sanguinis wound infection associated with marine environment exposure, Washington, USA.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2018; 24: 1942-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the O-antigen from P. cryohalolentis K5T was reported and is displayed in Figure 1 (7Kondakova A.N. Novototskaya-Vlasova K.A. Arbatsky N.P. Drutskaya M.S. Shcherbakova V.A. Shashkov A.S. Gilichinsky D.A. Nedospasov S.A. Knirel Y.A. Structure of the O-specific polysaccharide from the lipopolysaccharide of Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5(T) containing a 2,3,4-triacetamido-2,3,4-trideoxy-l-arabinose moiety.J. Nat. Prod. 2012; 75: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition to the unusual sugar, 2,3,4-triacetamido-2,3,4-trideoxy-l-arabinose, the O-antigen also contains two diacetamido d-sugars, l-rhamnose, and d-galactose. To date, there are no published reports on the structures and functions of the enzymes involved in the bioproduction of these amino sugars in P. cryohalolentis K5T. Given our long-standing interest in unusual sugar biosynthesis, we conducted an analysis of the P. cryohalolentis K5T genome sequence. Starting from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), we hypothesized that genes 0612, 0638, and 0637 in P. cryohalolentis K5T encode for a 4,6-dehydratase, a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase, and an N-acetyltransferase, which would be required for the biosynthesis of 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose as indicated in Figure 2. For the analysis presented here, the three above-mentioned genes were cloned, and the proteins encoded by them were overexpressed and purified. In the case of the 0612-encoded protein, the gene sequence suggested that it most likely contained a transmembrane region and a linker domain as previously observed for PglF from Campylobacter jejuni (8Riegert A.S. Thoden J.B. Schoenhofen I.C. Watson D.C. Young N.M. Tipton P.A. Holden H.M.

Consequently, truncation mutant variants were prepared as was done for PlgF in order to obtain soluble protein. Whereas it was possible to achieve reasonable protein expression of the 0612-encoded protein, once it was purified it behaved poorly in terms of solubility. All attempts to stabilize the protein were unsuccessful. However, the proteins encoded by 0638 and 0637 were stable.Figure 2Predicted pathway for the biosynthesis of UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report we present functional and structural data that demonstrate the proteins encoded by the 0638 and 0637 genes do indeed correspond to an aminotransferase (hereafter referred to as Pcryo_0638) and an N-acetyltransferase (Pcryo_0637). Importantly, the four high-resolution structures of the N-acetyltransferase reported provide further insight into this class of CoA-dependent left-handed β-helix superfamily members. Indeed, one of the structures is that of a tetrahedral intermediate. We also provide in Experimental procedures detailed methods for the efficient synthesis of both UDP-GlcNAc and acetyl-CoA, which allowed us to overcome their prohibitive costs. These methods will prove invaluable to other researchers investigating UDP-GlcNAc and acetyl-CoA dependent enzymes. Functional and structural investigations on enzymes involved in unusual sugar biosynthesis are often hampered because many of the ligands are not commercially available or are too costly for the quantities required for kinetic assays and X-ray crystallographic analyses. In order to conduct the biochemical investigations described here on both Pcryo-0638 and Pcryo-0637, it was necessary to prepare UDP-GlcNAc and acetyl-CoA in gram quantities. We were able to produce such quantities using in vitro enzymatic approaches. Specifically, for the production of UDP-GlcNAc, we modified a previously published procedure (9Chen Y. Thon V. Li Y. Yu H. Ding L. Lau K. Qu J. Hie L. Chen X. One-pot three-enzyme synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc derivatives.Chem. Commun. (Camb). 2011; 47: 10815-10817Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and cloned and purified the Escherichia coli W3110 UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, the E. coli W3110 inorganic pyrophosphatase, and the Bifidobacterium longum NaHK kinase required for the in vitro synthesis. As outlined in Experimental procedures, we were able to prepare ∼10 g of UDP-GlcNAc (typical cost for commercially available UDP-GlcNAc is $600 for 500 mg). The in vitro synthesis of acetyl-CoA was accomplished in two steps. The first step produced CoA starting from pantothenic acid. The following enzymes required for CoA biosynthesis, namely CoaA, CoaBC, CoaD, and CoaE, were cloned and purified to homogeneity from E. coli W3110. Following the in vitro synthesis of CoA and its subsequent purification, acetyl-CoA was produced using acetyl-CoA synthase, which was cloned from E. coli W3110 and purified in the laboratory. We produced ∼7 g of acetyl-CoA (typical cost for commercially available acetyl-CoA is between $700 and $1000 per 100 mg). On the basis of DNA sequence analyses, we postulated that the 0638 gene encodes for an aminotransferase that functions on UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (Fig. 2). Shown in Figure 3 is a plot of the initial velocity kinetic data for Pcryo_0638 using a discontinuous HPLC-based assay. Relevant kinetic parameters are presented in Table 1. The overall catalytic efficiency of Pcryo_0638 is 6.6 x 103 M-1s-1. This value is similar to those observed for other sugar aminotransferases presently being investigated in the laboratory, which lie in the range of 4–6 x 103 M-1s-1 (to be published at a later date).Table 1Kinetic data for Pcryo_0638 and Pcryo_0637enzymeSubstrateKM (mM)kcat (s-1)kcat/KM (M-1s-1)Pcryo_0638UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine0.29 ± 0.041.9 ± 0.26.6 (±0.7) x 103Pcryo_0637UDP-2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose0.62 ± 0.05545 ± 408.8 (±0.9) x 105Pcryo_0637Acetyl-CoA0.070 ± 0.0081900 ± 2002.7 (±0.3) x 107 Open table in a new tab Crystals of Pcryo_0638 were grown in the presence of PLP and UDP-2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose (the product).

Open table in a new tab Shown in Figure 4A is a ribbon representation of the dimer, which has an extensive total buried surface area of ∼5000 Å2. The electron densities for the two polypeptide chains of the dimer were continuous from Ala 5 to Asn 399. The α-carbons for the two subunits superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.14 Å, and thus the following discussion will refer only to subunit A unless otherwise indicated. Each subunit contains a seven-stranded mixed β-sheet, a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, a β-hairpin motif, and 12 α-helices (one of which contains 37 residues). There is a cis-peptide bond located between Trp 9 and Pro 10. The indole nitrogen of Trp 9 lies within 2.9 Å of the carbonyl group of Lys 185, the conserved lysine in aminotransferases that forms the Schiff base of the internal aldimine. The observed electron density for the ligand is displayed in Figure 4B. Given that the crystals were grown in the presence of PLP and the product, initial inspection of the map suggested that the external aldimine was bound. Even after modeling the ligand into the map, however, there was residual electron density calculated with (Fo–Fc) coefficients. To account for this observation, a mixture of the external aldimine and PMP was subsequently built into the electron density with each given half-occupancy. As can be seen, the electron density corresponding to the ribose sugar of the external aldimine is not well defined. This is most likely due to the lack of interactions between it and the protein as can be seen in Figure 4C. The uracil ring, however, is sandwiched between the side chains of Phe 335 and Tyr 229, which is contributed by subunit B. There are two additional interactions between it and the backbone amide of Gly 337 and an ordered water molecule. The side chains of Tyr 229 and Lys 215, both contributed by subunit B, lie within 3.2 Å of an α- and a β-phosphoryl oxygen, respectively. Seven water molecules also participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions with the phosphoryl oxygens. The pyranosyl moiety of the external aldimine adopts the 4C1 chair conformation. The C-2' acetamido group is anchored into the active site by the side chain of Gln 183 and a water molecule, whereas the pyranosyl ring oxygen lies at 3.0 Å from a water molecule. There are no interactions within 3.2 Å of the C-3' hydroxyl group and the protein. As is typical for PLP-dependent enzymes, the nitrogen and the oxygen of the pyridoxal moiety lie within 2.6 Å and 2.9 Å, respectively, to the side chains of Asp 156 and Gln 159. Shown in Figure 5 are plots of the initial velocity kinetic data for Pcryo_0637 again using a discontinuous HPLC-based assay and varying either the concentrations of UDP-2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose or acetyl-CoA. Relevant kinetic parameters are provided in Table 1. The catalytic efficiency of the enzyme with the UDP-sugar substrate is 8.8 (±0.9) x 105 M-1s-1. This value is similar to that observed for other N-acetyltransferases investigated in the laboratory (10Thoden J.B. Cook P.D. Schaffer C. Messner P. Holden H.M.

For the structural analysis of Pcryo_0637 described here, four different protein/ligand complexes were determined to high resolution. The first model of Pcryo_0637 to be described, namely that with bound UDP and acetyl-CoA, was refined to an R-factor of 19.5% at 1.3 Å resolution (model statistics are presented in Table 2). The crystals utilized for the investigation belonged to the space group R3 with one subunit in the asymmetric unit. Shown in Figure 6A is the electron density corresponding to the bound ligands. As can be seen, the electron density for the bound acetyl-CoA is well defined, whereas in the case of the UDP moiety it appears that the pyrophosphoryl group adopts two alternate conformations. The N-acetyltransferases belonging to the left-handed β-helix superfamily are known to function as trimers, and thus the local threefold rotational axis of Pcryo_0637 packed along a crystallographic triad. A ribbon representation of one subunit is provided in Figure 6B. The overall architecture of the subunit is distinctly bilobal with an N-terminal domain delineated from Ser 2 to Ser 93 and the C-terminal domain formed by Leu 94 to Ala 218. The N-terminal domain, characterized by a five-stranded mixed β-sheet surrounded by three α-helices, provides a binding platform for the UDP molecule. The C-terminal domain displays a classical left-handed β-helix motif with six complete turns. As can be seen, the acetyl-CoA ligand adopts an extended conformation, which allows the placement of the acetyl group into the active site region that is located at the interface of the two domains. A ribbon representation of the complete trimer is depicted in Figure 6C. The left-handed β-helices provide most of the subunit:subunit interactions. Indeed, whereas the total buried surface area for each subunit is ∼1850 Å2, 1200 Å2 arises from the left-handed β-helix motif. The acetyl-CoA moieties are wedged between the subunits of the trimer. There is one cis-peptide bond between Asn 212 and Pro 213. This cis-peptide is positioned in the last reverse turn of the subunit and from previous investigations is known to adopt the trans-conformation in the absence of CoA (14Rangarajan E.S. Ruane K.M.

The second model of Pcryo_0637 to be determined was that of a ternary complex with UDP-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose (the product) and CoA. The model was refined to an R-factor of 16.4% at 1.55 Å resolution. As shown in Figure 7A, the electron density corresponding to the bound ligands is unambiguous. A close-up view of the active site surrounding the UDP-product is presented in Figure 7B. The uracil ring is anchored into the active site by the backbone amide and the carboxylate side chain of Asp 41 and two ordered water molecules. The side chains of Asp 40 and Ser 11, along with a water molecule, lie within 3.2 Å of the ribose hydroxyl groups. Note that the side chain of Ser 11 adopts two conformations, the second of which allows it to form a hydrogen bond with an α-phosphoryl oxygen of the UDP-sugar product. Additionally, the phosphoryl oxygens are surrounded by numerous water molecules and the backbone amide groups of Cys 13 and Ala 75. The pyranosyl group of the UDP-sugar product directly interacts only with the side chain of His 142 and the backbone amide group of Gly 179 (both from a neighboring subunit of the trimer). On the basis of previously determined structures of related N-acetyltransferases, His 142 most likely functions as the active site base (14Rangarajan E.S. Ruane K.M. Sulea T. Watson D.C. Proteau A.

To address possible side chain movements in the active site upon catalysis, the third model of Pcryo_0637 to be solved was that of a ternary complex with UDP-2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose (the substrate) and CoA. The model was refined at 1.3 Å resolution to an overall R-factor of 17.7%. Shown in Figure 8A is the electron density for the corresponding ligands. Again, the conformations of the UDP-sugar substrate and CoA in the active site are unambiguous. The α-carbons for the two models, with either bound UDP-sugar substrate or UDP product, superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation of 0.08 Å, and there are no movements of the side chains in the active site cleft within experimental error. For the last structural analysis, the crystals of Pcryo_0637 were soaked in acetyl-CoA and the substrate, UDP-2-acetamido-4-amino-2,4,6-trideoxy-d-glucose in an attempt to visualize the Michaelis complex. It was anticipated that either the active site pocket would contain acetyl-CoA and the UDP-sugar substrate, or, if the enzyme was active in the crystalline lattice, it would show bound CoA and the UDP-sugar product. Unexpectedly, as can be seen from the electron density provided in Figure 8B, the tetrahedral intermediate was, in fact, trapped. The oxygen of the intermediate lies within 3.1 Å of the backbone amide group of Gly 160 from a neighboring subunit, thus providing an oxyanion hole. A superposition of the coordinates for this tetrahedral intermediate onto those of the enzyme/UDP-product/CoA complex reveals a movement of ∼0.6 Å in transitioning from sp3 to sp2 hybridization (Fig. 8C). The factors stabilizing the tetrahedral intermediate are unclear, but the electron density is unambiguous. This trapping of a tetrahedral intermediate was previously reported in the structure analysis of perosamine N-acetyltransferase from our laboratory (13Thoden J.B. Reinhardt L.A. Cook P.D. Menden P.

Shown in Figure 9 are the reactions catalyzed by PglE from C. jejuni and DesI from Streptomyces venezuelae (16Riegert A.S. Young N.M. Watson D.C. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M.

The substrate for PglE is identical to that for Pcryo_0638, whereas the substrate for DesI differs by having a hydroxyl group at C-2' and using dTDP as the nucleotide handle. An amino acid sequence alignment for these three proteins is presented in Figure 10A. The residues marked by the asterisks are those located within hydrogen-bonding distance of the external aldimine in Pcryo_0638. The only residues that are strictly conserved among these three proteins are Thr 60, Asp 156, Ser 180, Lys 185, and Asn 239 (Pcryo_0638 numbering). Shown in Figure 10B is a superposition of the observed positions for the external aldimines in Pcryo_0638 and PglE. The α-carbons for these two proteins correspond with a root-mean-square deviation of 2.3 Å. With respect to amino acid sequence, the two enzymes demonstrate a 27% identity and a 50% similarity. Whereas both enzymes function on the same substrate, the manner in which the ligands are accommodated in the active sites is remarkably different. In Pcryo_0638, the carboxamide group of Gln 183 interacts via a hydrogen bond with the C-2' acetamido group of the sugar. In PglE, the structurally equivalent residue is a glycine. Indeed, the position of Gln 183 precludes the ligand from binding to Pcryo_0638 in the manner observed for PglE. On the basis of the amino acid sequence, it might have been postulated that Tyr 229 and Tyr 219 in Pcryo_0638 and PglE, respectively, would adopt similar orientations in the active site. As can be seen, however, the orientation of Tyr 219 in PglE precludes the ligand from binding in the manner observed for Pcryo_0638. DesI and Pcryo_0638 show an amino acid sequence identity and similarity of 34% and 48%, respectively and their α-carbon positions superimpose with a root-mean-square deviation of 2.5 Å. The difference in ligand binding between Pcryo_0638 and DesI is equally fascinating as can be seen in Figure 10C. In DesI, the aromatic ring of Phe 229 (subunit B) and the guanidinium group of Arg 372 are the major driving forces for the alternate ligand-binding conformation. Indeed, in Pcryo_0638, these residues are a lysine and a phenylalanine, respectively. The striking difference in ligand binding between these three proteins yet again emphasizes the perils of model building and/or assumptions made simply on amino acid sequence alignments.

The biological puzzle is how does PDZ2 become accessible to GRK6A and what is the role of PTH in this process. Solving this dilemma is the goal of this study. We hypothesized that enzymatic phosphorylation of Ser162 located adjacent to the PDZ2 core-binding motif (-163GYGF166-) and incorporation of a double-charged phosphate group promote association between PDZ2 and GRK6A. Ser162 is a defined PKCɑ phosphorylation site (17Raghuram V. Hormuth H. Foskett J.K. A kinase-regulated mechanism controls CFTR channel gating by disrupting bivalent PDZ domain interactions.Proc.

It remains to be established whether the interaction between NHERF1 and PKCα is necessary for phosphorylation of Ser162. The experiments described here use a variety of complementary approaches to characterize the role of PDZ2 with phosphodeficient Ser162 on NHERF1-dependent PTH-sensitive phosphate uptake. Binding determinants of the interaction between PDZ2 or PDZ2 with phospho-Ser162, introduced genetically in NHERF1 using amber codon suppression, for the first time, and GRK6A were evaluated using fluorescence anisotropy (FA) and confirmed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our preliminary study suggests that a double-charged phospho-Ser162 is a key determinant of PTH signaling and is required for NHERF1-dependent NPT2A-mediated PTH-sensitive phosphate uptake. We first tested whether GRK6A is required for PTH-inhibitable phosphate uptake. For these experiments, we used opossum kidney (OK) cells that constitutively express Npt2a, Nherf1, and Grk6a and are considered the definitive model for PTH-sensitive phosphate transport †Human proteins are indicated by three-letter uppercase convention; genes in italics. Only the first letter is uppercase for the corresponding nonhuman protein or gene.. Grk6a was knocked down with targeted siRNA constructs. Both siRNA1 and siRNA2 reduced the response to PTH in the treated cells (Fig. 1A). si1Grk6a and si2Grk6a both reduced Grk6a expression by 90% and 98%, respectively (Fig. 1B). This finding implicates Grk6a in PTH-mediated signaling and regulation of Npt2a function. We next examined whether NHERF1 coimmunoprecipitates with Grk6a. Opossum kidney clone H (OKH) cells, functionally deficient in Nherf1 (24Biber J. Malmstrom K. Reshkin S. Murer H. Phosphate transport in established renal epithelial cell lines.Methods Enzymol. 1990; 191: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), were transfected with Flag-NHERF1 (WT) or Flag-NHERF1 constructs where the PDZ core-binding site -GYGF- was mutated to (-GAGA-) in PDZ1 (N1P1-GAGA), PDZ2 (N1P2-GAGA), or both (N1P1P2-GAGA). GRK6A more strongly interacts with N1P2-GAGA than with N1P1-GAGA (Fig. 2, A and B) (15Hall R.A. Spurney R.F. Premont R.T. Rahman N. Blitzer J.T. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 24328-24334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The nature of the high molecular weight band (>75 kDa) (Fig. 2A), which is not present in host cells, is not known. The binding affinity between recombinant NHERF1, N1P1-GAGA, or N1P2-GAGA constructs was determined by FA using a FITC-labeled 22-residue C-terminal GRK6A peptide (-553QRLFSRQDCCGNCSEEELPTRL576 [GRK6Act-22]) (Table 1). The findings reinforce the coimmunoprecipitation results (Fig. 2A). Full-length NHERF1 and NHERF1 with the modified PDZ2 (N1P2-GAGA) interact with a FITC-labeled human GRK6A C-terminal 22 amino acid peptide, GRK6Act-22, with dissociation constants (KD) of 5.3 ± 0.7 μM and 3.6 ± 0.2 μM, respectively. The interaction between full-length NHERF1 with the modified PDZ1 (N1P1-GAGA) and GRK6Act-22, is much less evident (Fig. S1, blue curve). To rule out the possibility of an effect of NHERF1 self-association on the KD, we additionally measured KD for an N1P1-GAGA construct wherein the C terminus 355-FSNL358 was mutated to -355AAAA358 (Δ4). Only a modest effect was observed on the binding between N1P1-GAGAΔ4 and GRK6Act-22 (Fig. S1, green curve). However, deleting the NHERF1 C-terminal (ΔEBD, 326–358 aa) substantially increased binding affinity (Fig. S1, red curve). The observed effect on affinity corroborates earlier studies showing that the flexible C-terminal EBD of NHERF1 limits access of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (-TRL ligand) to PDZ domains (18Li J.Q.

Next, we probed if N1P2-GAGA interacts with GRK6A to support PTH action on phosphate uptake. To accomplish this, we used OKH cells transfected with N1P2-GAGA and treated with 100 nM PTH(1–34). WT NHERF1 and N1P1-GAGA were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Surprisingly, N1P2-GAGA, like WT NHERF1, supports PTH inhibition of phosphate transport (Fig. 3). These findings imply that despite the modified PDZ2 core-binding motif in N1P2-GAGA, Grk6a nonetheless is able to interact with PDZ2, leading to phosphorylation of Ser290 and PTH action. How, then, might Grk6a bind PDZ2 with a disrupted core-binding motif? Insofar as N1P2-GAGA with the altered PDZ core-binding motif (-163GYGF166-) is denied a canonical interaction with the Grk6a C-terminal PDZ-ligand motif (-TRL), we sought to determine which residues in N1P2-GAGA support binding with Grk6a. We reasoned that the appearance of phospho-Ser162 flanking the PDZ2 core-binding motif (-163GYGF166-) and known as a direct substrate of PKCα (17Raghuram V. Hormuth H. Foskett J.K.

To investigate the effect of Ser162 phosphorylation on PTH-sensitive phosphate transport, we generated NHERF1 constructs wherein Ser162 was replaced by Ala (phosphoresistant mutant) or by Asp (phosphomimetic mutant). The phosphomimetic S162D mutation resulted in a significant reduction of basal phosphate transport compared with WT NHERF1 (Fig. 4), reflecting the absence of an interaction between Npt2a and NHERF1 S162D. In contrast, the phospho-resistant S162A mutant did not affect basal phosphate transport but somewhat abrogated the inhibitory response to PTH compared with WT NHERF1 (Fig. 4). Representative immunoblots demonstrate that the S162A mutant associates with Npt2a, whereas S162D failed to coimmunoprecipitate with Npt2a (Fig. 5). These results suggest that phosphomimetic S162D may restrict the interaction between NHERF1 PDZ1 and Npt2a.Figure 5S162D phosphomimetic mutation disrupts the interaction between NHERF1 and NPT2A.

Here, we used amber codon suppress ion to genetically encode pSer at position 162, which in the future will allow us to access phosphorylated full-length proteins comprising PDZ domains. This strategy requires a unique aminoacyl synthetase and tRNA pair specific for pSer and orthogonal to the natural translation system of Escherichia coli, thereby preventing cross-reactivity (25Rogerson D.T.

The secondary structure of the protein was measured by CD (Fig. S2). The binding affinity between pSer162-PDZ2 (133–300 aa) and FITC-labeled GRK6Act-22 was determined by FA and compared with the WT PDZ2 domain (133–300 aa) and S162A-PDZ2 (133–300 aa) (Table 2). The results demonstrate that the KD values for the interaction between WT PDZ2 or S162A-PDZ2 and GRK6Act-22 were comparable (51.3 ± 0.4, 43.4 ± 0.4 μM) and 2-fold higher than for pSer162-PDZ2 (26.1 ± 0.8; p < 0.0001 ANOVA) (Table 2 and Fig. S3). Thus, pSer162-PDZ2 enhanced binding affinity for GRK6A.Table 2Binding affinities between isolated PDZ2 domain or PDZ2 mutants and GRK6Act-22PDZ2 constructKD, μMWT PDZ251.3 ± 0.7aMeans and SDs are given (n = 3; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, ANOVA).pSer162-PDZ226.1 ± 0.8bMeans and SDs are given (n = 5; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, ANOVA).S162A-PDZ243.4 ± 0.4aMeans and SDs are given (n = 3; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001, ANOVA).FA, fluorescence anisotropy; GRK6Act-22, -553QRLFSRQDCCGNCSEEELPTRL576; pSer162, phosphorylated Ser162.Phosphorylated design is indicated by “p”.

FA experiments were performed in triplicate. We then applied explicit-solvent MD simulation to explore the structural determinants underlying the binding specificity of NHERF1 PDZ domains for GRK6A. A 9-residue, C-terminal GRK6A peptide (-568SEEELPTRL576) was used. The complexes between PDZ1, PDZ2, or pSer162-PDZ2 and a 9-residue, C-terminal GRK6A peptide (-568SEEELPTRL576) were computationally generated with the docking program ZDOCK (27Pierce B.G. Wiehe K.

ZDOCK server: Interactive docking prediction of protein-protein complexes and symmetric multimers.Bioinformatics. 2014; 30: 1771-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar) as described in Experimental procedures. The docking structures (Fig. S4) demonstrate that the C terminus of GRK6A (-T−2R−1 L0) goes deep in the PDZ1 or PDZ2 hydrophobic cavity between the α2 helix and the β2 sheet. The -TRL motif is involved in canonical interactions with the conserved residues from the core-binding motif 23GYGF26, α2 (Val76, Arg80), β2 (Leu28), or 163GYGF166, Val216, Arg220, Leu168 of PDZ1 and PDZ2, respectively. His72 or His212 of PDZ1 and PDZ2, respectively, specifically target Thr−2 of GRK6A. The PDZ2–GRK6Act-9 peptide (-568SEEELPTRL576) (hereafter GRK6Act-9) complex, in contrast to PDZ1–GRK6A, was unstable and showed a tendency to dissociate after 130 ns of MD simulation. MD simulations predict that in addition to the canonical PDZ-ligand interactions, Glu43 of PDZ1 associates tightly with the positively charged side chain of Arg−1 of GRK6A. The short distance (less than 2 Å) between the carboxylate oxygens of Glu43 (Oε1 and Oε2) and the NHη2 group of Arg−1 of GRK6A permits formation of strong electrostatic interactions (Fig. S4A). Compared with Glu43, Asp183 at the homologous position in PDZ2 does not interact with the side chain of Arg−1. The latter is solvent-exposed and characterized by multiple orientations during the MD simulation. The distances between the NHη2 group of Arg−1 and carboxylate oxygens of Asp183 (Oδ1 and Oδ2) from 6.8 to 13.4 Å along the simulation time trajectory (Fig. S4B) indicate that the naturally occurring Glu to Asp replacement on PDZ2 decreases the binding affinity for the C-terminal motif of GRK6A. This observation is consistent with coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 2) and FA experimental data (Table 1 and Fig. S1) showing a weak association between PDZ2 and GRK6A compared with PDZ1. A similar tendency was observed for NHERF1 PDZ domains interacting with the C-terminal -TRL motif of NPT2A (28Mamonova T. Zhang Q. Khajeh J.A. Bu Z. Bisello A. Friedman P.A.

MD simulations demonstrate that incorporation of phospho-Ser162 does not induce conformational changes in the PDZ2–GRK6Act-9 structure. However, comparative analysis of PDZ2–GRK6Act-9 and pSer162–PDZ2–GRK6Act-9 revealed a significant difference in the orientation of Arg−1 of the GRK6A -TRL motif (Fig. 6 and Fig. S4). The positively charged side chain of Arg−1 rotates toward the negatively charged phosphate group of Ser162 during the first 2 ns of MD simulation and remains in this conformation for the remainder of the simulation (159 ns) (Fig. 6). The average distances calculated between the NHη1 or NHη2 group of Arg−1 of GRK6A and OP1 or OP2 group of pSer162 are around 2 Å for the last 10 ns of MD simulation (Fig. 6). This indicates that the negatively charged phosphate group has a significant impact on dynamics and conformation of the positively charged side chai"

It consists of a core particle (CP), which contains proteolytic active sites that can associate with different regulators to form various complexes. How these different complexes are regulated and affected by changing physiological conditions, however, remains poorly understood. In this study, we focused on the activator Blm10 and the regulatory particle (RP). In yeast, increased expression of Blm10 outcompeted RP for CP binding, which suggests that controlling the cellular levels of Blm10 can affect the relative amounts of RP-bound CP. While strong overexpression of BLM10 almost eliminated the presence of RP-CP complexes, the phenotypes this should induce were not observed. Our results show this was due to the induction of Blm10-CP autophagy under prolonged growth in YPD. Similarly, under conditions of endogenous BLM10 expression, Blm10 was degraded through autophagy as well. This suggests that reducing the levels of Blm10 allows for more CP-binding surfaces and the formation of RP-CP complexes under nutrient stress. This work provides important insights into maintaining the proteasome landscape and how protein expression levels affect proteasome function. The proteasome selectively degrades proteins.

This work provides important insights into maintaining the proteasome landscape and how protein expression levels affect proteasome function. Most protein degradation in eukaryotic cells is performed by a large complex known as the proteasome. Unlike lysosomal and secreted proteases, proteasomes sequester proteolytic active sites away from potential substrates as they are located within a barrel-shaped structure known as the core particle (also known as CP or 20S). CP is composed of two sets of 14 unique subunits. These subunits are arranged in four stacked heptameric rings. α subunits 1–7 form the outer rings while the two inner rings are composed of β subunits 1–7. Three pairs of proteolytic β subunits, each with distinct specificity, are responsible for cleaving substrates into short polypeptides (1Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D.

Dohmen R.J. Catalytic mechanism and assembly of the proteasome.Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1509-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Peptides released by the proteasome are further processed by cytosolic peptidases to produce intermediates for various metabolic processes (3Reits E. Griekspoor A. Neijssen J. Groothuis T.

While the CP alone appears to be able to degrade certain classes of substrates, e.g., under oxidative stress, it is well established that the majority of substrates cannot be degraded by CP alone (5Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. A gated channel into the proteasome core particle.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The reason for this is threefold; first, most substrates are labeled for degradation with a posttranslational modification on lysine residues known as ubiquitination. The receptors that recognize this modification are not part of the CP. Second, most substrates contain stable tertiary and quaternary structures, which require unfolding before they can enter the CP. Third, even when substrates are unfolded or disordered, entry into the catalytic chamber is restricted by a gate composed of the N termini of α subunits (5Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. A gated channel into the proteasome core particle.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). The association of CP with the regulatory particle (RP or 19S) eliminates all of these limitations and results in the formation of the 26S proteasome (here used to refer to CP complexes with one or two RPs). The RP is composed of 19 polypeptides. Three of these function as intrinsic ubiquitin receptors, Rpn1, Rpn10, and Rpn13, and thus are able to bind substrates (6Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C.

These substrates are deubiquitinated by various deubiquitinating enzymes including the intrinsic RP subunit Rpn11 and the proteasome-associated enzyme Ubp6. A hexameric ring of six AAA-ATPases (Rpt1-6) utilizes ATP to unfold substrates and translocate them into the CP for degradation. Several of the ATPase subunits have C-terminal tails with a conserved Hb-Y-X motif (Hb refers to a hydrophobic amino acid, Y is tyrosine, and X can be any amino acid). Docking of these tails into pockets on the surface of the CP α-ring contributes to the affinity between RP and CP as well as induces conformational changes that open the gate and allow for substrate entry into the core particle (10Rabl J. Smith D.M. Yu Y. Chang S.C. Goldberg A.L. Cheng Y. Mechanism of gate opening in the 20S proteasome by the proteasomal ATPases.Mol.

Thus, 26S proteasomes bind, unfold, and subsequently degrade the majority of physiologically important substrates. Besides RP, several other complexes can associate with the same surface of CP that is occupied by RP, namely the 11S activator (REGα-β and REGγ, a.k.a. as PA28αβ and PA28γ; not found in yeast), Pba1-Pba2/PAC1-PAC2, Blm10/PA200, and Fub1/PI31 (11Sadre-Bazzaz K.

However, none of these can hydrolyze ATP or are able to recognize ubiquitinated substrates suggesting that their function is either different or more specialized. In general terms, they could function as a competitor to prevent RP binding.

A second possible function involves a role during CP assembly or maturation. Pba1-Pba2 was shown to stimulate α-ring assembly and prevented RP from associating with immature CP (17Hirano Y.

Deeds E.J. Roelofs J. Maturation of the proteasome core particle induces an affinity switch that controls regulatory particle association.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Another possible function is in regulating the localization or transport of CP, e.g., into or out of the nucleus. Such a role has been proposed for Blm10 in yeast (19Weberruss M.H. Savulescu A.F. Jando J. Bissinger T. Harel A. Glickman M.H. Enenkel C. Blm10 facilitates nuclear import of proteasome core particles.EMBO J. 2013; 32: 2697-2707Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Finally, these CP-associated proteins may function as distinct, specialized degradation complexes. Here, the degradation would not depend on ubiquitination-based substrate targeting (considering the lack of ubiquitin receptors) or protein unfolding (considering the lack of ATPase activity in these regulators). This role is consistent with the proposed function for REGγ in degrading intrinsically disordered proteins in the nucleus (20Chen X. Barton L.F. Chi Y. Clurman B.E. Roberts J.M.

Virol. 2009; 83: 2389-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The above models act under the assumption that CP forms homogeneous complexes where one type of activator binds both ends of the CP; however, CP can actually form hybrid complexes where RP binds to one end, while the other end is occupied by one of these alternative regulators. Such complexes have been purified from cells and detected in cell lysates (25Hendil K.B. Khan S. Tanaka K. Simultaneous binding of PA28 and PA700 activators to 20 S proteasomes.Biochem.

The formation of hybrid complexes could cause a change in cellular localization of RP-CP complexes. Binding of other activators may also induce allosteric changes inside the CP that affect the specificity of proteolytic cleavage or change cleavage dynamics and peptide retention in the catalytic chamber. As such, hybrid complexes could degrade ubiquitinated proteins, but produce peptides of different composition and length as final products that are released by the proteasome. REGα-β forms heptameric rings that stimulate gate opening through a mechanism different from RP. The C-terminal Hb-Y-X motifs of REGα-β contribute to CP binding but are not involved in gate opening. Instead, gate opening occurs through an activation loop within REGα-β that induces conformational changes required for access (28Forster A. Masters E.I. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Hill C.P.

Blm10 is a unique regulator as it has been observed bound to both mature and immature CP. Blm10 can be bound to CP alone or in hybrid complexes with RP. Blm10 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PA200 in humans) is a single ∼240 kDa polypeptide that contains multiple heat repeats, a bromodomain-like region, and an Hb-Y-X motif at its C terminus. Similar to other activators, this motif allows Blm10 to bind to a pocket on the surface of the α ring, specifically the α5-α6 pocket (11Sadre-Bazzaz K. Whitby F.G. Robinson H. Formosa T. Hill C.P. Structure of a Blm10 complex reveals common mechanisms for proteasome binding and gate opening.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 728-735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, unlike other regulators, Blm10 binds proteasomes as a monomeric protein. Binding of Blm10 to the CP induces partial gate opening and increases peptidase activity; therefore, Blm10 has been described as an activator (30Dange T. Smith D. Noy T. Rommel P.C. Jurzitza L. Cordero R.J. Legendre A. Finley D. Goldberg A.L. Schmidt M. Blm10 protein promotes proteasomal substrate turnover by an active gating mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 42830-42839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, Blm10-CP complexes have been reported to be involved in degradation of short peptides and unstructured proteins such as tau, which is reasonable considering those do not require ubiquitination or ATPase-dependent unfolding (30Dange T.

In addition, Blm10 appears to be required for the degradation of Sfp1 and histones, further supporting a role for Blm10 in protein degradation (31Lopez A.D. Tar K. Krugel U. Dange T. Ros I.G.

The presumably folded nature of these substrates might indicate a role for hybrid RP-CP-Blm10 complexes. However, a clear mechanism of action for these hybrid complexes is unknown and other factors might assist in the degradation. Considering that Blm10 is also found on an immature form of CP, a role in CP maturation has also been proposed. However, its function here seems very different from the assembly chaperones Pba1-Pba2, which seems to exclusively bind to immature CP. Pba1-Pba 2 has a very low affinity for mature CP and a high affinity for the immature form (18Wani P.S. Rowland M.A. Ondracek A. Deeds E.J. Roelofs J. Maturation of the proteasome core particle induces an affinity switch that controls regulatory particle association.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Pba1-Pba2 is more embedded in the α ring of immature CP compared with mature CP, thus restricting RP-CP interactions (34Kock M. Nunes M.M. Hemann M. Kube S. Dohmen R.J. Herzog F. Ramos P.C. Wendler P. Proteasome assembly from 15S precursors involves major conformational changes and recycling of the Pba1-Pba2 chaperone.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 6123Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). While Blm10 could potentially perform a similar role for immature CP, there is no apparent difference in Blm10 affinity for mature versus immature CP that would allow for an exchange of regulators in maturation. Consistent with this, deletion of Blm10 showed no obvious defect in CP maturation (35Fehlker M. Wendler P. Lehmann A. Enenkel C.

The predicted bromodomain-like region of Blm10/PA200 was shown to specifically bind acetylated histones, which led to the subsequent degradation of histones by PA200-CP complexes (32Mandemaker I.K. Geijer M.E. Kik I. Bezstarosti K. Rijkers E. Raams A. Janssens R.C. Lans H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Demmers J.A. Vermeulen W. Marteijn J.A.

However, recent structural work on the PA200-CP complex raises some questions in this regard and shows that PA200 binds to inositol phosphates, which have been shown to bind and regulate histone deacetylases (42Toste Rego A. da Fonseca P.C.A.

Furthermore, binding of PA200 results in an unusually wide α ring. These conformational changes are propagated to the active site β subunits, thereby changing the structure of the active sites and affecting proteasome activity. Specifically, activation of β2 trypsin-like activity was observed along with a slight inhibition of β5 and β1 activity (44Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Three new dominant drug resistance cassettes for gene disruption in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar). In order to gain insight into the physiological role of Blm10 containing complexes, we altered the abundance of this protein in yeast and monitored the effects of its overexpression on the proteasome landscape. Further, we sought to determine how Blm10-bound complexes are affected by starvation conditions. The proteasome CP is a cylindrically shaped structure able to bind one of numerous regulators. However, binding of these regulators is mutually exclusive as they bind the same interface of CP. Thus, there are a variety of proteasome complexes that contain one or two copies of a particular regulator. Additionally, hybrid complexes (CP with two different regulators) can form. In all, there is the potential for a varied landscape of proteasome complexes. Several of these potential complexes have been observed in yeast as well as mammalian cells, e.g. (45Cascio P. Call M. Petre B.M. Walz T. Goldberg A.L. Properties of the hybrid form of the 26S proteasome containing both 19S and PA28 complexes.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2636-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 46Kopp F. Dahlmann B. Kuehn L.

Biol. 2001; 313: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); however, our understanding of the mechanisms and regulations that govern this landscape is limited. In lysates of a strain where the endogenous copy of α1 was tagged with GFP, a number of these complexes can be distinguished on native gel (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Whole-cell lysate prepared by cryo-grinding was separated on native gel and imaged for GFP to identify the native complexes that contained the CP subunit α1. A number of species can be readily identified; from top to bottom these are: CP with RP bound on both ends (RP2-CP), CP-RP with Blm10 bound (Blm10-CP-RP), CP with one RP (RP-CP), CP with Blm10 bound on both ends (Blm102-CP), CP with Blm10 bound on one end, and free CP. Assignment of these species is based on extensive work by us and other laboratories (47De La Mota-Peynado A. Lee S.Y. Pierce B.M. Wani P. Singh C.R. Roelofs J.

https://openalex.org/W3132347112,"Bacterial survival during lethal heat stress relies on the cellular ability to reactivate aggregated proteins. This activity is typically executed by the canonical 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70)–ClpB bichaperone disaggregase, which is most widespread in bacteria. The ClpB disaggregase is a member of the ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities protein family and exhibits an ATP-driven threading activity. Substrate binding and stimulation of ATP hydrolysis depends on the Hsp70 partner, which initiates the disaggregation reaction. Recently elevated heat resistance in gamma-proteobacterial species was shown to be mediated by the ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities protein ClpG as an alternative disaggregase. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ClpG functions autonomously and does not cooperate with Hsp70 for substrate binding, enhanced ATPase activity, and disaggregation. With the underlying molecular basis largely unknown, the fundamental differences in ClpG- and ClpB-dependent disaggregation are reflected by the presence of sequence alterations and additional ClpG-specific domains. By analyzing the effects of mutants lacking ClpG-specific domains and harboring mutations in conserved motifs implicated in ATP hydrolysis and substrate threading, we show that the N-terminal, ClpG-specific N1 domain generally mediates protein aggregate binding as the molecular basis of autonomous disaggregation activity. Peptide substrate binding strongly stimulates ClpG ATPase activity by overriding repression by the N-terminal N1 and N2 domains. High ATPase activity requires two functional nucleotide binding domains and drives substrate threading which ultimately extracts polypeptides from the aggregate. ClpG ATPase and disaggregation activity is thereby directly controlled by substrate availability.

High ATPase activity requires two functional nucleotide binding domains and drives substrate threading which ultimately extracts polypeptides from the aggregate. ClpG ATPase and disaggregation activity is thereby directly controlled by substrate availability. Bacterial 100-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp100) chaperones constitute a subfamily of ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+) proteins and play crucial roles in proteostasis networks by acting on misfolded and aggregated proteins (1Puchades C. Sandate C.R. Lander G.C. The molecular principles governing the activity and functional diversity of AAA+ proteins.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2020; 21: 43-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). They consist of one or two AAA domains, which mediate ATP binding and hydrolysis and oligomerization into hexameric rings. The energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is used to thread substrate proteins through an inner translocation channel. Substrate-binding pore residues of the AAA domains are arranged in a spiral staircase and propel the substrate in discrete steps that are orchestrated by cycles of sequential ATP hydrolysis events (2Gates S.N. Martin A. Stairway to translocation: AAA+ motor structures reveal the mechanisms of ATP-dependent substrate translocation.Protein Sci. 2020; 29: 407-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although AAA+ proteins share this basic motor activity, they differ substantially in cellular functions and act on diverse substrates. Functional specificity is gained by extra domains, which are either fused to or are inserted into the AAA module (3Mahmoud S.A. Chien P. Regulated proteolysis in bacteria.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 677-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 4Olivares A.O. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Mechanistic insights into bacterial AAA+ proteases and protein-remodelling machines.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These extra domains either directly interact with specific substrates or act as binding platforms for cooperating adaptor proteins, which deliver their bound cargo for processing by their AAA+ partner proteins (5Kirstein J. Moliere N. Dougan D.A. Turgay K. Adapting the machine: Adaptor proteins for Hsp100/Clp and AAA+ proteases.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 589-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Extra domains can additionally regulate ATPase activity of AAA+ proteins, allowing to adjust AAA+ motor activity to partner and substrate availability (6Mogk A. Bukau B. Kampinga H.H. Cellular handling of protein aggregates by disaggregation machines.Mol. Cell. 2018; 69: 214-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Hsp100 disaggregases solubilize aggregated proteins and protect cells during severe heat stress, which causes protein misfolding and aggregation (6Mogk A. Bukau B. Kampinga H.H. Cellular handling of protein aggregates by disaggregation machines.Mol. Cell. 2018; 69: 214-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Hsp100 disaggregases are composed of two AAA domains (AAA1 and AAA2) but differ with respect to composition of extra domains. The most widespread bacterial disaggregation system is composed of the AAA+ protein ClpB, which cooperates with a cognate 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) (DnaK) chaperone system (7Zolkiewski M.

This allows recruitment of ClpB to the aggregate surface, as ClpB does not directly bind to protein aggregates but requires Hsp70 for targeting (14Winkler J. Tyedmers J. Bukau B. Mogk A.

Notably, clpG can also be encoded in the core genome of bacteria, although this placement is less frequent (24Lee C. Franke K.B. Kamal S.M. Kim H. Lunsdorf H. Jager J. Nimtz M. Trcek J. Jansch L. Bukau B. Mogk A. Romling U. Stand-alone ClpG disaggregase confers superior heat tolerance to bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E273-E282Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa clone C strains encode for two clpG copies, one located in the core chromosome (clpGGC) and a second on the transmissible locus for protein quality control island (clpGGI). As a hallmark of the ClpG subfamily of Hsp100 disaggregases, both ClpG proteins exhibit stand-alone protein disaggregation activity in vitro and can functionally replace each other in vivo, indicating similar basic functionality irrespective of gene synteny (24Lee C. Franke K.B. Kamal S.M. Kim H. Lunsdorf H. Jager J. Nimtz M. Trcek J. Jansch L. Bukau B. Mogk A. Romling U. Stand-alone ClpG disaggregase confers superior heat tolerance to bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E273-E282Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). GlpG and ClpB can functionally replace each other in vivo for basic lethal temperature tolerance (24Lee C. Franke K.B.

ClpG provides increased heat resistance by acting as superior disaggregase.Biomolecules. 2019; 9: 815Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the two disaggregases differ in fundamental mechanistic aspects as ClpB strictly requires cooperation with the Hsp70 (DnaK) chaperone system. These differences in mechanisms of disaggregation must be reflected in sequence variability of shared domains and/or the presence of extra domain(s); however, a systematic analysis of ClpG extra domain functions has not been performed. ClpG (ClpK) exhibits a similar core domain organization as compared with ClpB but possesses a distinct M domain and an N1 domain and a C-terminal extension (CTE) not present in other Hsp100 family members. Here, we dissect the roles of individual domains of P. aeruginosa ClpGGI, which represents the best characterized family member to date. By deleting individual extra domains, we confirm that solely the ClpGGI-specific N1 domain is essential for aggregate binding and subsequent disaggregation. Intriguingly, an N1 domain fusion converts ClpB into an autonomous disaggregase. ClpGGI ATPase activity is negatively regulated by both N1 and N2 domains and positively by the ATPase activity of the alternate AAA+ domain, with substrate binding to override ATPase control by N1 and N2, directly linking substrate presence to high ATPase and disaggregation activities. Mutating pore-located aromatic residues in the AAA domains reduces (AAA1) or abolishes (AAA2) disaggregation activity, confirming substrate threading as a force-generating step in disaggregation and defining the AAA2 ring as a main threading motor. Together, these findings define the basic mechanism of ClpG-mediated disaggregation and ATPase control. ClpG harbors two N domains (N1 and N2), two AAA domains (AAA1, AAA2), an AAA1-inserted M domain and a CTE (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1). Sequence conservations among ClpG homologs are very high in both AAA domains and lower in extra domains, as also observed for other Hsp100 family members (Fig. S2). The N1 domain represents a defining feature of ClpG proteins distinctively discriminating this subfamily from other Hsp100 proteins (Fig. 1A). The N2 domain of ClpG is homologous to N domains of other Hsp100 proteins such as ClpA, ClpB, and ClpC (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1). The ClpG M domain is predicted to form a coiled-coil structure composed of a single helical wing, like the M domain of ClpC but it is shorter than the ClpB M domain, which is composed of two wings (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1). ClpG also separates from ClpB by harboring a CTE including 20 to 40 residues that is typically enriched for proline and lysine residues and is predicted disordered. The role of the N1 domain has been initially characterized. N1 deletion strongly reduces ClpG disaggregation activity in vitro and in vivo and can increase basal ATPase activity (24Lee C. Franke K.B. Kamal S.M. Kim H. Lunsdorf H. Jager J. Nimtz M. Trcek J. Jansch L. Bukau B. Mogk A. Romling U. Stand-alone ClpG disaggregase confers superior heat tolerance to bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E273-E282Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis of the crucial role of the N1 domain is not fully understood. N1 confers autonomous aggregate binding to P. aeruginosa ClpGGC as a respective ΔN1 deletion mutant does no longer bind to protein aggregates. On the other hand, ΔN1–ClpGGI still seems to interact with aggregated proteins in vitro (24Lee C. Franke K.B. Kamal S.M. Kim H. Lunsdorf H. Jager J. Nimtz M. Trcek J. Jansch L. Bukau B. Mogk A. Romling U. Stand-alone ClpG disaggregase confers superior heat tolerance to bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: E273-E282Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remained unclear whether the low disaggregation activity of ΔN1–ClpG stems from deficiencies in aggregate binding or is caused by indirect effects through, for example, deregulation of ATPase control. To dissect the roles of ClpG characteristic domains, we focused our analysis on P. aeruginosa ClpGGI, which represents the best-characterized family member to date (24Lee C. Franke K.B. Kamal S.M. Kim H. Lunsdorf H. Jager J. Nimtz M. Trcek J. Jansch L. Bukau B. Mogk A. Romling U. Stand-alone ClpG disaggregase confers superior heat tolerance to bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ClpG provides increased heat resistance by acting as superior disaggregase.Biomolecules. 2019; 9: 815Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and generated ClpGGI deletion mutants lacking individual domains. In addition, we deleted both N domains yielding ΔN1/2–ClpGGI. All deletion mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli ΔclpB and dnaK103 mutant cells, which lack the ClpB/DnaK (Hsp70) disaggregase and are therefore sensitive to exposure to 50 °C. ClpGGI can functionally replace ClpB and Hsp70 upon overexpression in E. coli and even provides increased heat resistance to ΔclpB cells as it exhibits higher disaggregation activity than the canonical ClpB disaggregase (24Lee C. Franke K.B. Kamal S.M. Kim H. Lunsdorf H. Jager J. Nimtz M. Trcek J. Jansch L. Bukau B. Mogk A. Romling U. Stand-alone ClpG disaggregase confers superior heat tolerance to bacteria.Proc. Natl. Acad.

ClpG provides increased heat resistance by acting as superior disaggregase.Biomolecules. 2019; 9: 815Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The production levels of ClpGGI in complementation assays were similar to those of ClpB or DnaK controls produced from the same expression vector (Fig. S3A). ClpB or DnaK overexpression did not restore heat tolerance of dnaK103 or ΔclpB cells, respectively, underlining the specific function of ClpGGI as stand-alone disaggregase (Fig. S3, B and C). To test whether ClpGGI overproduction is required for complementation activity, we expressed the disaggregase in E. coli dnaK103 mutant cells in the presence of varying IPTG concentrations (0–250 μM) and determined production levels and cellular protection upon heat shock to 49 °C (Fig. S3, D and E). We observe that ClpGGI overproduction in the presence of 100- to 250-μM IPTG is necessary for providing efficient heat resistance to these cells. All ClpGGI-based deletion constructs except those lacking the N1 domain provided heat resistance to both E. coli mutant strains (Fig. 1, B and C), comparable with ClpGGI WT except for ClpGGI-ΔCTE, which provided slightly reduced heat resistance to dnaK103 cells. Expression levels of all mutant constructs were similar except for those lacking the N1 domain (Fig. S3, F and G), raising the possibility that lower levels of ΔN1–ClpGGI and ΔN1/N2–ClpGGI contribute to the lack of complementation activity in vivo. We also tested the abilities of ClpGGI deletion mutants to complement the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype of E. coli dnaK103 cells at 41 °C (Fig. S4). We again find that the N1 domain is essential for complementation activity, while N2 or M domain deletions exhibited activities similar to ClpGGI WT. A CTE deletion lowered the ability of ClpGGI to complement significantly more than in the lethal heat tolerance assay (Fig. 1C). Notably, in this assay, the highest complementation activities were observed in presence of 25- to 50-μM IPTG, while higher IPTG concentrations particularly reduced the ability of ClpGGI deletion mutants to restore growth at 41 °C. This finding suggests that high levels of these mutant proteins provoke deleterious effects in dnaK103 cells at high temperatures. To better characterize and compare the ClpGGI deletion mutants, we purified all constructs and determined their disaggregation activities toward heat-aggregated malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and firefly luciferase (Fig. 2). Deleting the N2 and M domains or the CTE still allowed for efficient reactivation of both aggregated model substrates by ClpGGI. ΔN2–ClpGGI exhibited, however, reduced activity toward aggregated luciferase and reactivated 15.5% as compared with 40.7% by ClpGGI WT (Fig. 2, D and E). Disaggregation kinetics toward luciferase aggregates were lower than aggregated MDH with lower renatured protein product, indicating that disentanglement of these aggregates is more challenging and less efficient. On the other hand, ΔN1–ClpGGI did not reactivate aggregated Luciferase and exhibited 11.6-fold reduced disaggregation activity toward MDH as compared with ClpGGI WT (Fig. 2, A–C). ΔN1/2–ClpGGI did not exhibit any disaggregation activity, suggesting that the residual MDH disaggregation activity of ΔN1–ClpGGI stems from the N2 domain. These results from in vitro disaggregation experiments largely agreed with those obtained from in vivo heat-resistance experiments. Together, these findings underline the most crucial role of the N1 domain for ClpGGI disaggregation activity in vitro and in vivo, whereas all other extra domains are not essential. We were wondering whether we could overcome ClpB dependence on DnaK and converting it into a stand-alone disaggregase by fusing N1 or N1/N2 domains of ClpGGI to the ClpB ATPase motor composed of its AAA1 and AAA2 domains and the regulatory M domain (Fig. 3A). F1–ClpB and F1/2–ClpB showed partial disaggregation activity and reactivated 20.1% and 18.2% of MDH after 120 min, respectively. Because DnaK also activates the ClpB ATPase ring by displacing repressing M domains, we additionally generated chimeras harboring the M domain mutation Y503D, which causes derepression of the AAA domains independent of DnaK (16Oguchi Y. Kummer E. Seyffer F. Berynskyy M. Anstett B. Zahn R. Wade R.C. Mogk A. Bukau B. A tightly regulated molecular toggle controls AAA+ disaggregase.Nat. Struct. Mol.

M domains couple the ClpB threading motor with the DnaK chaperone activity.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 247-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Purified fusion constructs were probed for reactivation of aggregated MDH. F1–ClpB–Y503D and F1/2–ClpB–Y503D exhibited MDH refolding kinetics and yields that were indistinguishable from ClpGGI or ClpB in the presence of the DnaK chaperone system (KJE: DnaK, DnaJ, GrpE). These findings imply that fusion of N1 and concurrent abolition of M domain repression converts ClpB into a highly efficient and stand-alone disaggregase. Accordingly, the disaggregation activity of F1–ClpB could be increased upon addition of DnaK507 (Fig. S4, A–C). DnaK507 lacks the C-terminal helical bundle of the DnaK substrate binding domain and activates ClpB ATPase activity by binding and displacing M domains (35Fernandez-Higuero J.A. Aguado A. Perales-Calvo J. Moro F. Muga A. Activation of the DnaK-ClpB complex is regulated by the properties of the bound substrate.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In absence of its J domain protein partner, DnaJ, DnaK507 cannot bind to substrates and thus does not recruit ClpB to protein aggregates. Accordingly, DnaK507 did not allow for ClpB-mediated protein disaggregation (Fig. S5, A–C). The stimulatory effect of DnaK507 on F1–ClpB therefore only involves the displacement of repressing M domains and demands for autonomous binding of F1–ClpB to the aggregated substrate.

Ribonuclease H (RNase H), a ubiquitous enzyme, is found in all organisms from bacteria to mammals (1Hostomsky Z. Zuzana H. Matthews D.A. Ribonucleases H.in: Roberts R.J. Nucleases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 341-376Google Scholar). RNase H is an endoribonuclease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the RNA strand of RNA/DNA hybrids and produces 5’-phosphate and 3’-hydroxyl termini. RNase H requires divalent metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+) for its enzymatic activity (2Hans Stein P.H.

The important functions of RNases H are: 1) the removal of an RNA strand from an R-loop that is composed of two antiparallel DNA strands plus one RNA strand; 2) removal of RNA fragments (Okazaki fragments) that are produced during DNA replication (5Sugimoto K. Okazaki T. Okazaki R. Mechanism of DNA chain growth, II. Accumulation of newly synthesized short chains in E. coli infected with ligase-defective T4 phages.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

There are two types of RNase H enzymes; type 1 (RNase HI) and 2 (RNase HII and HIII), the amino acid sequences of which are not conserved except for the active sites, but their tertiary structures resemble each other and have the above activities (8Tadokoro T. Kanaya S. Ribonuclease H: Molecular diversities, substrate binding domains, and catalytic mechanism of the prokaryotic enzymes.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 1482-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). It is also important to note that RNase HI from Escherichia coli (E. coli) is quite similar to the C-terminal domain of the reverse transcriptase (RT) of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), which actually also has RNase H activity and is considered to be a research target for future therapy (9Sarafianos S.G.

The crystal structures of E. coli RNase HI were reported in 1990 by Katayanagi et al. (11Katayanagi K. Miyagawa M. Matsushima M. Ishikawa M. Kanaya S. Ikehara M. Matsuzaki T. Morikawa K.

Soon afterward, two classes of catalytic mechanisms were proposed to explain the mechanism for the hydrolysis of RNase H, i.e., a one-metal ion mechanism (13Nakamura H. Oda Y. Kanaya S. Kimura S. Katsuda C. Katayanagi K. Morikawa K. Miyashiro H. Ikehara M. How does RNase H recognize a DNA-RNA hybrid?.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Crystal structure of the ribonuclease H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Despite the structural consistency between RNase HI and the C-terminal domain of RT, the need for more than one divalent metal ion has remained a controversial issue. In 2005, the crystal structure of Bacillus halodurans RNase H, which was mutated to an inactive form, complexed with an RNA/DNA hybrid and two Mg2+ ions, was reported (16Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A.

This poses a problem for the structural analysis of a native complex such as an active enzyme and a natural substrate by X-ray crystallography or NMR. In this context, it should be noted that a recent study by time-resolved X-ray crystallography led to the proposal that the canonical two-metal binding mechanism should be revised to a considerable extent (20Samara N.L. Yang W. Cation trafficking propels RNA hydrolysis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2018; 25: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, a higher concentration of metal ion, which is often used in preparing a crystal of a metal-requiring protein, makes the issue of the stoichiometry of the metal ion in the complex controversial (21Strange R.W.

Chem. 2008; 80: 8246-8252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the case of RNase HI, the crystals were prepared using a 100 mM MgSO4 solution (23Katayanagi K. Okumura M. Morikawa K. Crystal structure of Escherichia coli RNase HI in complex with Mg2+ at 2.8 Å resolution: Proof for a single Mg2+-binding site.Proteins. 1993; 17: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or 1 mM MnCl2 (17Goedken E.R.

Such high concentrations of metal ions might result in the formation of crystal structures with extra metal ions imbedded within them. Considering the concentrations of major divalent cations in E. coli cells (Mg2+: 10−2 M, Zn2+: 10−3 M, Mn2+: 10−5 M in total), (Mg2+: less than 2 mM, Zn2+: low nM, Mn2+: sub μM in the free form) (24Outten C.

Catalytic mechanism of RNA backbone cleavage by ribonuclease H from quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics simulations.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2011; 133: 8934-8941Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Meanwhile, regarding RT, it has been shown that other divalent cations (Zn2+ and Mn2+) also support the hydrolysis reaction at much lower concentrations, i.e., in the range of a few and several μM, respectively, while these two metal ions could also function as a potent inhibitor of RT in the presence of Mg2+ ion (26Fenstermacher K.J. DeStefano J.J. Mechanism of HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition by zinc: Formation of a highly stable enzyme-(primer-template) complex with profoundly diminished catalytic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 40433-40442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The above investigators concluded that the Zn2+ inhibition is not due to the inhibition of catalysis but, rather, to the formation of a highly stable, kinetically diminished complex. In fact, RNase H activity is repressed under high concentrations of Mn2+ (1 mM) and Mg2+ (50 mM) (17Goedken E.R. Marqusee S.

The unique coordination property of several divalent metal ions and the structural commonalty in the active domain of many nucleotide cleaving enzymes, including RT, prompted us to analyze the active complex of RNase HI, an RNA/DNA hybrid, and metal ions, with emphasis on the binding properties of Mn2+ and Zn2+ as a function of hydrolysis activity. In recent years, electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry (MS) has been used for the analysis of native proteins or proteins that are complexed with various compounds. Such measurements can be made on a water-based solvent system, which is close to physiological conditions. This technique has been widely used in the analyses of various types of noncovalent protein–protein and protein–ligand complexes (27Robinson C.V. Groß M. Eyles S.J. Ewbank J.J. Mayhew M. Hartl F.U.

As a result, the stoichiometry of the components in a complex, even those that are transiently formed in solution, can be revealed. In this study, we report, for the first time, the detection of the ternary complex of native RNase HI: RNA/DNA hybrid: divalent metal ions (Mn2+ and Zn2+). It was possible to monitor a dynamic change in the complex within a few minutes. In addition, the stoichiometry of the Mn2+ ion to the RNase HI: substrate was measured by ESI-MS in parallel with an enzymatic activity assay, which allowed us to conclude that the ternary complex, the solution of which showed the most activity, predominantly involves two divalent cations but that a minor fraction is present with only one divalent cation, which essentially supports the canonical “two metal ions mechanism.” Furthermore, the ternary complex containing, in fact, Zn2+ ions was found to hold the full-length substrate, but with a “nick” inside. This unexpected observation allowed us to conclude that Zn2+ ions are retained within a highly stable complex with an RNA strand, even after the cleavage of the phosphate backbone. This also explains why the properties of the Zn2+ ion are different from Mn2+ ions in terms of their ability to inhibit RNase H activity via the formation of a highly stable complex and also explains the essential role of the second divalent metal ion in hydrolysis activity. The ESI-MS of an equimolar mixture of RNase HI and 8-mer RNA/8-mer DNA gave multiply charged ion peaks (7+ to 9+), which corresponded to a 1:1 complex of RNase HI: RNA/DNA hybrid, implying that the complex was stable in solution and the gaseous phase after being sprayed, and its ion particles were maintained during the mass measurement (Fig. 1A). Note that the expanded view of the 8+ charged ion showed the adduction of ammonium or/and sodium ions, which are frequently observed in MS, especially, when an aqueous buffer is used. This result indicates that a 1:1 complex could be easily formed without metal ion(s). When the length of the RNA/DNA hybrid was increased to a 14-mer, traces of the 2 (RNase HI): 1 (RNA/DNA) complex were observed (Fig. 1B). This 2:1 complex was predominant when the protein concentration was increased to twice that of RNA/DNA hybrid (Fig. 1C), implying that a longer RNA/DNA chain would be capable of recruiting multiple enzyme molecules on it. In fact, the crystal structure of the human RNase H C-terminal domain: 14 mer of RNA/DNA hybrid showed that it was a 2:1 complex, in which each RNase H molecule was bound independently to the free space of the RNA/DNA strand (Fig. S1). It is noteworthy that the intensity of the complex with either the DNA and RNA strand was much less than that with the RNA/DNA hybrid (Fig. S2), which could be partly attributed to a lack of synergetic binding force between the strands or either of the strands and the enzyme (see Fig. S1A). It should also be noted that only traces of the complex with the single RNA strand were observed (Fig. S2A), which can be attributed to the repulsion between 2-OH group of the ribose skeleton and the binding site(s) of the enzyme (19Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Ghirlando R. Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Structure of human RNase H1 complexed with an RNA/DNA hybrid: Insight into HIV reverse transcription.Mol.

Mg2+ at a concentration of a few mM or Mn2+ at concentrations of several μM supports optimal enzyme activity (17Goedken E.R. Marqusee S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 7266-7271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), while, at RT, Zn2+ inhibits the active enzyme with Mg2+ at a level of a few μM (26Fenstermacher K.J. DeStefano J.J. Mechanism of HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition by zinc: Formation of a highly stable enzyme-(primer-template) complex with profoundly diminished catalytic activity.J. Biol.

Analogous to the human RNase H C-terminal domain, the former two metal ions could be coordinated with the carboxylate groups of Asp10, Asp70, Asp134, and Glu48 of RNase HI and a phosphate group of the RNA strand (see Fig. S1), but the structure of the Zn-coordinated enzyme has not yet been solved. Tsunaka et al. (32Tsunaka Y. Takano K. Matsumura H. Yamagata Y. Kanaya S. Identification of single Mn2+ binding sites required for activation of the mutant proteins of E.coli RNase HI at Glu48 and/or Asp134 by X-ray crystallography.J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 1171-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) reported that the binding of the first Mn2+ ion eventually triggers the coordination of the two Mn2+ ions into the mutant RNase HI using a crystal prepared in the presence of 5 to 10 mM of MnCl2. Based on several reports regarding the metal-binding properties of RNase H, it would be interesting to determine whether those divalent metal ions are also specifically bound to the enzyme in solution. In the presence of each metal ion at a concentration of 4 μM, which is stoichiometrically equivalent to the RNase HI molecule, a single Zn2+ ion was found to bind to the enzyme in a stoichiometric manner, although this does not necessarily mean that it directly binds to a specific site (Fig. 2). At 16 and 200 μM concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ ions, evidence of metal ion adduction was observed, which is frequently observed in MS of biological compounds and is evidenced by the progressive increase in the number of adduct ions along with increasing concentrations of metal ions. It is possible that these adduct ions could bind nonspecifically to the protein surface by electrostatic interactions. In order to detect the ternary complex with enzymatic activity being retained, the solution conditions and measurement parameters for ESI-MS were optimized (see Experimental procedures). Note that the pH was set at 6.0, which was lower than the optimal value (pH 7–8) for expressing activity, because the rate of substrate cleavage under the optimal condition was too fast to permit the enzyme: substrate complex to be detected in the current timescale of mass measurement (∼3.5 min). The enzymatic activity under the above conditions was measured using the 8-mer RNA/8-mer DNA as a substrate, which has a single cleavage site in the RNA molecule, with various concentrations of Mn2+ ion (0–20 μM) (Fig. S3). The value was found to be 0.84 pmol (RNA)/min・pmol (RNase HI), based on Equation 1, making it ca. 55 times less active than that obtained under the conditions that were used in Fig. S4. In order to avoid ion suppression in ESI-MS, the concentrations of protein, RNA/DNA hybrid, and divalent metal ion salts were minimized to 4 μM, 10 μM, and 4 to 20 μM, respectively, (Fig. 3). The mass measurement in parallel to the activity assay gave a correlation between complex formation and activity. When the concentration of Mn2+ was increased from 4 to 20 μM, which corresponds to 1 to 5 M equivalents to the enzyme, the ternary complex, RNase HI: RNA/DNA: two Mn2+, started to be observed at 4 μM of Mn2+ and became predominant at a concentration of around 16 μM (Fig. 3A), the concentration at which two Mn2+ ions could be readily associated with the complex, which was essentially negligible without the substrate (Fig. 2). The relative abundance of the ternary complex with two Mn2+ ions (blue bars in Fig. 3B) was in good agreement with an increase in enzyme activity. Note that around 70% “Percentage of product” in the activity can be attributed to the short incubation time (2 min) under the limited reaction conditions. When the mixture containing 16 μM Mn2+ was allowed to further stand for 3.5 min, the completely hydrolyzed products were obtained (see the inset of Fig. S3). Based on the above observations, it appears that RNase HI requires two Mn2+ ions for its activity to be fully expressed. The preparation with 16 μM Mn2+ (four equivalents to the enzyme) was subjected to ESI-MS measurement and continuously monitored from 1.5 to 3.5 min since after mixing all the components (Fig. 4A). From 1.5 to 2.0 min, the ternary complex with two Mn2+ ions was predominantly observed together with the substrate (Fig. 4B); from 2.0 to 3.0 min, the relative abundance of the ternary complex gradually decreased and those of the complexes of RNase HI: 5-mer RNA: 8-mer DNA (red), RNase HI: DNA (blue), and RNase HI (green) correspondingly increased; from 3.0 to 3.5 min, the ternary complex was barely observed, and instead, the latter three components became prominent (Fig. 4C). This result indicates that the reaction of the 2.5-fold substrate over the enzyme under the present conditions proceeded rapidly and reached a steady state in around 3 min, none of the resulting products that were comprised of the enzyme itself and that complexed with DNA or DNA/degraded RNA contained a Mn2+ ion. The observation of the complex with an intact DNA chain in the final solution provides support for the conclusion that the enzyme favorably binds to the ssDNA chain (Fig. S2). Notably, a minor portion of the RNase HI complex with a single Mn2+ was found along with the major complex that contained two Mn2+ ions (see Fig. 3). This may be related to the controversial issue of whether a single Mn2+ would be mobile within the active site during the progress of the reaction (14Kashiwagi T. Jeanteur D. Haruki M. Katayanagi K. Kanaya S. Morikawa K. Proposal for new catalytic roles for two invariant residues in Escherichia coli ribonuclease HI.Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ternary complex with a Zn2+ ion was tested following the same procedures as above. Unlike the results for the Mn complex, the MS profile remained unchanged throughout the measurement from 1.5 to 3.5 min after mixing the enzyme, substrate, and Zn2+ ion (Fig. 5, A and B). This result indicates that all of the constituents in the solution had already reached a steady state at the start of the measurement, which turned out to be comprised of five reaction products: RNase HI: Zn2+ (green), RNase HI: DNA: Zn2+ (blue), RNase HI: 5-mer RNA/DNA: Zn2+ (red), RNase HI: 6-mer RNA/DNA: Zn2+ (violet), and [RNase HI: nicked RNA/DNA hybrid: 2Zn2+] (orange). As expected from the results shown in Figure 2, all of the products contained a bound Zn2+ ion. The expanded view of the intact ternary complex at the 8+ charge state showed the presence of two ion species at m/z 2824.84 and 2835.40 as the major components, which was in agreement with the calculated values for RNase HI: RNA/DNA: Zn2+ (calcd. 2825.35 (8+)) and [RNase HI: RNA/DNA: 2Zn2+] +18 (calcd. 2835.53 (8+)), respectively (Fig. 5, C and D). The latter value was estimated to be the active ternary complex with two Zn2+ ions, but to retain the cleaved RNA chain, the +18 Da is due to H2O. Such a complex has never been observed for the Mn complex. The above reaction mixture, obtained at the starting point of the mass measurement, was also subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (see the inset of Fig. S5), supporting the fact that the substrate was completely hydrolyzed at 1.5 min after mixing. This unexpected and surprising finding accounts for the Zn complex forming a stable complex with the RNA chain, even after cleavage had occurred, and further, for the role of the second divalent metal ion for the hydrolysis activity, although the disposition of the Zn2+ ions in the structure has not yet been elucidated. It should also be noted that the complex with the 6-mer RNA (colored in violet in Fig. 5A) was barely observed for the case of the Mn complex, but the complex with 5-mer RNA, which was the major cleavage product based on the HPLC profile (see Fig. S5), was observed in both cases. This difference in the cleavage products can be attributed to the slight change in the enzyme specificity via coordination with Zn2+ ions. The result is consistent with a previous report showing that Zn2+ ion supports enzyme activity at lower concentrations of Zn2+ ion (∼25 μM), and the observation of the complex, [RNase HI: nicked RNA/DNA hybrid: 2Zn2+], may account for the inhibitory property of the Zn complex at RT by forming a highly stable, kinetically diminished complex (26Fenstermacher K.J. DeStefano J.J. Mechanism of HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition by zinc: Formation of a highly stable enzyme-(primer-template) complex with profoundly diminished catalytic activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 40433-40442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). ESI-MS provided a snapshot of a ternary complex, RNase HI: RNA/DNA hybrid: divalent metal ions (Mn2+, Zn2+ in this study), which could be transiently formed in buffer solution, and the structure was maintained during the time required to make the MS measurement, which was carried out within a few minutes. The functional relevance of the observed complex was evidenced by the enzymatic activity, which was measured using the same solution that was used in the ESI-MS. With an incremental increase in the Mn2+ ion concentration from 0 to 5 mol per mole of RNase HI, the activity reached nearly the maximal level in the present assay conditions (see Experimental procedures), at which the complex comprised of RNase HI: RNA/DNA: Mn2+ (1: 1: 2) was observed to be the predominant component. In turn, the level of the RNase HI: RNA/DNA (1: 1) complex was decreased; the RNase HI: RNA/DNA: Mn2+ (1: 1: 1) complex was increased to around 8 μM of Mn2+, then decreased slightly, but remained in part, even at 20 μM of Mn2+ (Fig. 3). This is likely due to the turnover of Mn2+ ions during the enzyme reaction. However, considering the fact that the active enzyme with Mg2+ was inhibited by 50% in the presence of ∼500 μM MnCl2 (26Fenstermacher K.J. DeStefano J.J.

While the specific affinity of the enzyme for Mn2+ ion was nearly negligible, two Mn2+ ions apparently coordinated at the same con"

Acute phase genes, especially Serum Amyloid A3 (Saa3), are highly expressed in the lung following pulmonary exposure to particles. We aimed to investigate whether the human acute phase protein SAA (a homolog to mouse SAA3) accelerated atherosclerotic plaque progression in Apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE−/−) mice. Mice were intratracheally (i.t.) instilled with vehicle (phosphate buffered saline) or 2 µg human SAA once a week for 10 weeks. Plaque progression was assessed in the aorta using noninvasive ultrasound imaging of the aorta arch as well as by en face analysis. Additionally, lipid peroxidation, SAA3, and cholesterol were measured in plasma, inflammation was determined in lung, and mRNA levels of the acute phase genes Saa1 and Saa3 were measured in the liver and lung, respectively. Repeated i.t. instillation with SAA caused a significant progression in the atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta (1.5-fold). Concomitantly, SAA caused a statistically significant increase in neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (625-fold), in pulmonary Saa3 (196-fold), in systemic SAA3 (1.8-fold) and malondialdehyde levels (1.14-fold), indicating acute phase response (APR), inflammation and oxidative stress. Finally, pulmonary exposure to SAA significantly decreased the plasma levels of very low-density lipoproteins - low-density lipoproteins and total cholesterol, possibly due to lipids being sequestered in macrophages or foam cells in the arterial wall. Combined these results indicate the importance of the pulmonary APR and SAA3 for plaque progression."

Materials and methods A total of 176 axillary lymph nodes of patients with breast cancer, consisting of 87 metastatic axillary lymph nodes (ALNM) and 89 negative axillary lymph nodes proven by surgery, were retrospectively reviewed from the database of our cancer center. For each selected axillary lymph node, 106 radiomic features based on preoperative pharmacokinetic modeling dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (PK-DCE-MRI) and 5 conventional image features were obtained. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select useful radiomic features. Logistic regression was used to develop diagnostic models for ALNM. Delong test was used to compare the diagnostic performance of different models. Results The 106 radiomic features were reduced to 4 ALNM diagnosis–related features by LASSO. Four diagnostic models including conventional model, pharmacokinetic model, radiomic model, and a combined model (integrating the Rad-score in the radiomic model with the conventional image features) were developed and validated. Delong test showed that the combined model had the best diagnostic performance: area under the curve (AUC), 0.972 (95% CI [0.947–0.997]) in the training cohort and 0.979 (95% CI [0.952–1]) in the validation cohort. The diagnostic performance of the combined model and the radiomic model were better than that of pharmacokinetic model and conventional model (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion Radiomic features extracted from PK-DCE-MRI images of axillary lymph nodes showed promising application for diagnosis of ALNM in patients with breast cancer."

Thus, understanding client’s knowledge about SARS-COV2 causes, roots of transmissions, and prevention strategies are urgently warranted. Although there were global studies reported knowledge and preventive practices of COVID-19, but the information is not representative and inclusive for Ethiopia. Thus, the current study is done to identify the knowledge and the prevention strategies for COVID-19 among clients in South Wollo, Ethiopia. Methods An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 21 to 30, 2020 among clients seeking service in Dessie town health facilities. A total of 81 clients were included from the selected health facilities with simple random sampling technique. We developed measuring tools by adopting from World Health Organization and center for disease prevention recommendation manual for assessing service providers’ knowledge and preventive practices. For data entry Epi-data 3.1 version was employed and further data management and analysis was performed using STATA Version 14. Student T-test and one way ANOVA were computed to see the mean difference in knowledge and practice between and among the group. Chi-square test was also done to portray the presence of association between different co-variants with client’s knowledge and preventive practices. Results Findings of the study showed that more than half (56.8%) of the participants had good knowledge about its symptoms, way of spread and prevention of the virus. Furthermore, 65.4% of clients demonstrated five or more preventive practice measures of COVID-19. The mean preventive practice score with standard deviation was (4.75±1.28 from 6 components). In the current study, knowledge had no significant difference among sex, education status, and monthly income. However, COVID-19 transmission knowledge was significantly higher among urban residents. Thus, clients who were knowledgeable about way of transmission and symptoms of COVID-19 had significantly higher COVID-19 preventive practice. Conclusion Our findings revealed that clients’ knowledge and preventive practice of COVID-19 were not optimal. Clients with good knowledge and urban residents had practiced better prevention measures of the pandemic, signifying that packages and programs directed in enhancing knowledge about the virus is useful in combating the pandemic and continuing safe practices."
https://openalex.org/W3134072543,"Infectious diseases and invasive species can be strong drivers of biological systems that may interact to shift plant community composition. For example, disease can modify resource competition between invasive and native species. Invasive species tend to interact with a diversity of native species, and it is unclear how native species differ in response to disease-mediated competition with invasive species. Here, we quantified the biomass responses of three native North American grass species ( Dichanthelium clandestinum , Elymus virginicus , and Eragrostis spectabilis) to disease-mediated competition with the non-native invasive grass Microstegium vimineum . The foliar fungal pathogen Bipolaris gigantea has recently emerged in Microstegium populations, causing a leaf spot disease that reduces Microstegium biomass and seed production. In a greenhouse experiment, we examined the effects of B . gigantea inoculation on two components of competitive ability for each native species: growth in the absence of competition and biomass responses to increasing densities of Microstegium . Bipolaris gigantea inoculation affected each of the three native species in unique ways, by increasing ( Dichanthelium ), decreasing ( Elymus ), or not changing ( Eragrostis ) their growth in the absence of competition relative to mock inoculation. Bipolaris gigantea inoculation did not, however, affect Microstegium biomass or mediate the effect of Microstegium density on native plant biomass. Thus, B . gigantea had species-specific effects on native plant competition with Microstegium through species-specific biomass responses to B . gigantea inoculation, but not through modified responses to Microstegium density. Our results suggest that disease may uniquely modify competitive interactions between invasive and native plants for different native plant species."

We aimed to compare the EGFR mutation-guided target therapy versus empirical chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in the public healthcare setting of Hong Kong. Methods A Markov model was designed to simulate outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC adult patients with un-tested EGFR-sensitizing mutation status. Four treatment strategies were evaluated: Empirical first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin-pemetrexed (empirical chemotherapy group), and EGFR mutation-guided use of a TKI (afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib). Model outcome measures were direct medical cost, progression-free survival, overall survival, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost per QALY gained (ICER) was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of model results. Results Empirical chemotherapy and EGFR mutation-guided gefitinib gained lower QALYs at higher costs than the erlotinib group. Comparing with EGFR mutation-guided erlotinib, the afatinib strategy gained additional QALYs with ICER (540,633 USD/QALY). In 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations for probabilistic sensitivity analysis, EGFR mutation-guided afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib and empirical chemotherapy were preferred strategy in 0%, 98%, 0% and 2% of time at willingness-to-pay (WTP) 47,812 USD/QALY (1x gross domestic product (GDP) per capita), and in 30%, 68%, 2% and 0% of time at WTP 143,436 USD/QALY (3x GDP per capita), respectively.

We aimed to identify predictive factors associated with the deterioration of Child-Pugh score at 8 weeks after lenvatinib initiation. Patients with adequate clinical data and baseline preserved serum samples available were included. Baseline fibroblast growth factor (FGF)19 and 21, angiopoietin (ANG)2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were evaluated. Thirty-seven patients were included, and 6, 15, 14, and 2 experienced complete response, partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. Twenty-four (65%) and 13 (35%) patients showed a maintained/improved and deteriorated Child-Pugh-score, respectively. While baseline clinical data, treatment response, and laboratory data were similar between these two patient groups, baseline ANG2 and VEGF levels were significantly higher ( P = 0.0017) and lower ( P = 0.0231), respectively, in patients with deteriorated Child-Pugh score than in those without. Based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, cut-off values for ANG2 and VEGF were found to be 3,108 pg/mL and 514.9 pg/mL, respectively. Among patients with low VEGF and high ANG2, 89% (8/9) exhibited a deteriorated Child-Pugh score, whereas none of the patients (0/9) with high VEGF and low ANG2 did. The deterioration of the Child-Pugh score in patients with unresectable HCC who are treated with lenvatinib may be predictable based on combined baseline serum ANG2 and VEGF levels."
https://openalex.org/W3129212723,"Allosteric proteins with multiple subunits and ligand-binding sites are central in regulating biological signals. The cAMP receptor protein from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CRPMTB) is a global regulator of transcription composed of two identical subunits, each one harboring structurally conserved cAMP- and DNA-binding sites. The mechanisms by which these four binding sites are allosterically coupled in CRPMTB remain unclear. Here, we investigate the binding mechanism between CRPMTB and cAMP, and the linkage between cAMP and DNA interactions. Using calorimetric and fluorescence-based assays, we find that cAMP binding is entropically driven and displays negative cooperativity. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments show that apo-CRPMTB forms high-order CRPMTB–DNA oligomers through interactions with nonspecific DNA sequences or preformed CRPMTB–DNA complexes. Moreover, we find that cAMP prevents and reverses the formation of CRPMTB–DNA oligomers, reduces the affinity of CRPMTB for nonspecific DNA sequences, and stabilizes a 1-to-1 CRPMTB–DNA complex, but does not increase the affinity for DNA like in the canonical CRP from Escherichia coli (CRPEcoli). DNA-binding assays as a function of cAMP concentration indicate that one cAMP molecule per homodimer dissociates high-order CRPMTB–DNA oligomers into 1-to-1 complexes. These cAMP-mediated allosteric effects are lost in the double-mutant L47P/E178K found in CRP from Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (CRPBCG). The functional behavior, thermodynamic stability, and dimerization constant of CRPBCG are not due to additive effects of L47P and E178K, indicating long-range interactions between these two sites.

In contrast, structures of the CRP from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (CRPMTB) in the apo-form and cAMP-bound form reveal smaller cAMP-induced conformational changes (Fig. 1, A and B, bottom) (11Gallagher D.T. Smith N. Kim S.K. Robinson H. Reddy P.T. Profound asymmetry in the structure of the cAMP-free cAMP Receptor Protein (CRP) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.J. Biol.

The CRPEcoli and CRPMTB display structural differences in both the apo-state and cAMP-bound state, most notably in their DNA-binding domain orientations relative to the cAMP-binding domains (Fig. 1C). Additional differences are observed in the homodimer symmetry. In the CRPEcoli, the two subunits in the apo-state are symmetric, but the cAMP-bound state shows asymmetry between the DNA-binding domains' conformation (18Evangelista W. Dong A. White M.A. Li J. Lee J.C. Differential modulation of energy landscapes of cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) as a regulatory mechanism for class II CRP-dependent promoters.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15544-15556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1D, top). Conversely, the subunits in the CRPMTB in the apo-state are asymmetric at the dimer interface helix (c-helix) and the DNA-binding domains, but the cAMP-bound state is highly symmetric (Fig. 1D, bottom). Finally, the CRPMTB harbors two additional α-helices, one at the N terminus and another at the C terminus, resulting in a slightly larger protein than the CRPEcoli (Fig. 1E). The CRPEcoli and CRPMTB show structural differences, and their functional response to cAMP binding also differs. In the CRPEcoli, cAMP binding enhances the affinity of the protein to tightly interact with pseudopalindromic gene promoter sequences involved in carbohydrate metabolism (18Evangelista W. Dong A.

The small cAMP-induced conformational change in the CRPMTB provides a structural explanation by which this protein does not change its affinity to DNA upon binding to the cyclic nucleotide (6Bai G.

It is therefore possible that the CRPMTB is not sensitive to cAMP, but previous studies have shown that cAMP interactions with the CRPMTB are important in the regulation of the gene whiB1 (12Stapleton M.

It is therefore possible that the allosteric regulation triggered by cAMP in the CRPMTB may not be directly associated to large changes in protein conformation that enhance the affinity for specific DNA promoter sequences, as seen in the CRPEcoli. To dissect the mechanisms by which cAMP allosterically regulates CRPMTB–DNA binding, in this study, we quantitatively characterize the linkage between cAMP and DNA interactions. We combine complementary solution biophysical approaches to measure cAMP-binding affinity and cooperativity, interactions with the DNA promoter SerC (6Bai G. McCue L.A. McDonough K.A.

Microbiol. 2011; 82: 180-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as a function of cAMP concentration, and protein solution structure, assembly, and thermodynamic stability. The results from this study reveal that the CRPMTB binds cAMP with moderate negative cooperativity. In agreement with previous reports (12Stapleton M. Haq I. Hunt D.M. Arnvig K.B. Artymiuk P.J. Buxton R.S. Green J. Mycobacterium tuberculosis cAMP receptor protein (Rv3676) differs from the Escherichia coli paradigm in its cAMP binding and DNA binding properties and transcription activation properties.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7016-7027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the affinity of the CRPMTB for promoter sequences is similar in the presence and in the absence of cAMP, indicating that the cyclic nucleotide does not regulate transcription at the level of affinities to specific DNA promoter sequences. We find that in the apo-state, the protein forms high-order CRPMTB–DNA oligomers. These oligomers are mediated by interactions between the CRPMTB and nonspecific DNA sequences, and by interactions between a CRPMTB–DNA complex and the free CRPMTB. Unexpectedly, the presence of cAMP decreases nonspecific interactions with DNA and reversibly dissociates high-order CRPMTB–DNA oligomers into stable, 1-to-1 stoichiometric complexes. We also investigated the double-mutant L47P/E178K, which is found in the CRP from the attenuated Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin strain (CRPBCG) (mutation sites shown in Fig. 1A, bottom) and only differs from the CRPMTB sequence in those two amino acid residues (28Hunt D.M. Saldanha J.W. Brennan J.F. Benjamin P. Strom M. Cole J.A. Spreadbury C.L. Buxton R.S.

While the CRPBCG displays negative cAMP-binding cooperativity like the CRPMTB, we find that cAMP does not prevent the formation of high-order CRPBCG–DNA oligomers. These functional differences are not observed in the single mutants L47P (CRPMTB–L47P) and E178K (CRPMTB–E178K), indicating nonlinear contributions and long-range interactions between the two mutation sites. In agreement with nonlinear mutant contributions, the thermodynamic stability and dimerization constant of the CRPBCG are also different from the single mutants. In combination, these results provide an archetype of cAMP-mediated regulation that is significantly different from those described previously in other CRPs, such as the well-characterized E. coli homolog, and illustrate that structural homology does not imply allosteric homology. In other words, two structures could be very similar but respond very differently to the same allosteric effector. We first used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to quantitatively determine the cAMP-binding affinity constants, cooperativity, and their underlying thermodynamic driving forces (Fig. 2A, Table 1). To ensure full saturation of the CRPMTB, we conducted ITC experiments using up to a five-fold molar excess of cAMP to protein. By fitting the ITC data to various binding models, we found that a two-site sequential binding mechanism (19Lanfranco M.F. Gárate F. Engdahl A.J. Maillard R.A. Allewell N.

Communications between the high-affinity cyclic nucleotide binding sites in E. coli cyclic AMP receptor protein: Effect of single site mutations.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11857-11867Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) provided better fitting statistics than a set of independent binding sites (Fig. S1 and Table S1). The site-specific binding constants we obtained were k1 = (3.0 ± 0.9)⋅104 M−1 and k2 = (1.2 ± 0.2)⋅104 M−1 (all errors represent the SD of the fit). The ratio between the two binding constants, c = k2/k1 = 0.4 ± 0.2, indicates negative cooperativity between the two cAMP-binding domains (Table 1). ITC experiments using various buffers (Hepes, PBS, and cacodylate, Fig. S2 and Table S1) were performed to dissect a potential contribution of proton ionization to the observed cAMP-binding enthalpies and to determine whether the release or uptake of protons is associated with the cAMP-binding reactions (31Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M.

J. 1996; 71: 2049-2055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We find that both cAMP-binding events are endothermic (enthalpy change for the first cAMP-binding site = 4.7 ± 0.3 kcal mol−1 and enthalpy change for the second cAMP-binding site = 5.0 ± 1.0 kcal mol−1) and therefore entropically driven (TΔS1 = 10.8 kcal mol−1 and TΔS2 = 10.5 kcal mol−1). Moreover, we find that the first cAMP-binding event is independent of the buffer-ionization enthalpy, whereas the second one displayed a slope of 1.0 ± 0.3, indicating proton uptake by the protein (Fig. 2B). The asymmetry in proton uptake during cAMP binding may be a consequence of the asymmetry seen in the apo-CRPMTB structure (Fig. 1D, bottom) or asymmetric states in partially liganded conformations (19Lanfranco M.F. Gárate F. Engdahl A.J. Maillard R.A. Allewell N. Asymmetric configurations in a reengineered homodimer reveal multiple subunit communication pathways in protein allostery.J. Biol.

Importantly, in all three buffers used in this study, a two-site sequential binding mechanism resulted in better fitting statistics (Table S2) and revealed negative cAMP-binding cooperativity (Table 2). In addition to ITC experiments, we monitored cAMP binding via changes in 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid (ANS) fluorescence (Fig. 2C) (19Lanfranco M.F. Gárate F. Engdahl A.J. Maillard R.A.

The data were fitted to two binding polynomials, wherein a model allowing for cooperativity provided a statistically better fit than a model with independent binding sites (Fig. S3 and Table S2). Moreover, the binding constants obtained from the ANS-based assay are in agreement with the results using ITC and support the observed negative cooperativity between the two cAMP-binding sites: k1 = (3.5 ± 0.2)⋅104 M−1 and k2 = (2.2 ± 0.1)⋅104 M−1 and c = 0.6 ± 0.1 (Table 1).Table 1cAMP-binding affinity constants for the CRPMTBMethodcAMP-binding affinityBinding cooperativityk1k2cITC3.0 ± 0.91.2 ± 0.20.4 ± 0.2ANS3.5 ± 0.22.2 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.1ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid; c, cooperativity factor between cAMP-binding sites; CRPMTB, CRP from Mycobacterium tuberculosis; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; k1, cAMP-binding affinity constant for the first cAMP-binding site; k2, cAMP-binding affinity constant for the second cAMP-binding site.The error corresponds to the SD from fitted parameters using a two-site binding model as described in Experimental procedures.

Previous structural studies have shown that binding of cAMP induces small conformational changes to the DNA-binding domain of the CRPMTB, allowing the protein to switch from an asymmetric structure to a symmetric, active conformation (11Gallagher D.T.

However, the effect of this conformational transition on the affinity between the CRPMTB and DNA promoter sequences is not fully understood. Thus, we investigated the role that cAMP occupancy plays in the formation of the CRPMTB–DNA complex. The formation of the CRPMTB–DNA complex was monitored via changes in fluorescence anisotropy, normalized to the first protein concentration point (19Lanfranco M.F. Gárate F. Engdahl A.J.

We determined the effects of ten actin-binding compounds on the interaction of cardiac myosin subfragment 1 (S1) with pyrene-labeled F-actin (PFA). These compounds, previously identified from a small-molecule high-throughput screen (HTS), perturb the structural dynamics of actin and the steady-state actin-activated myosin ATPase activity. However, the mechanisms underpinning these perturbations remain unclear. Here we further characterize them by measuring their effects on PFA fluorescence, which is decreased specifically by the strong binding of myosin to actin. We measured these effects under equilibrium and steady-state conditions, and under transient conditions, in stopped-flow experiments following addition of ATP to S1-bound PFA. We observed that these compounds affect early steps of the myosin ATPase cycle to different extents. They increased the association equilibrium constant K1 for the formation of the strongly bound collision complex, indicating increased ATP affinity for actin-bound myosin, and decreased the rate constant k+2 for subsequent isomerization to the weakly bound ternary complex, thus slowing the strong-to-weak transition that actin–myosin interaction undergoes early in the ATPase cycle. The compounds' effects on actin structure allosterically inhibit the kinetics of the actin–myosin interaction in ways that may be desirable for treatment of hypercontractile forms of cardiomyopathy.

Actin is abundant in eukaryotic cells and is involved in many important cellular processes such as movement, cell division, maintenance of cellular shape, transport of vesicles, phagocytosis, and contractility (1Lee S.H. Dominguez R. Regulation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics in cells.Mol. Cells. 2010; 29: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Actin interacts with and is regulated by many actin-binding proteins, such as capping and severing proteins, nucleating proteins, and stabilizers. Actin interacts with myosin to generate force and movement, which is regulated in the muscle by proteins such as tropomyosin, troponin, and myosin-binding protein C. In striated muscle contraction, actin and myosin interactions are nucleotide-dependent, as the hydrolysis of ATP by myosin provides energy for the structural and affinity changes that result in force. In rigor, actin (A) and myosin (M) bind strongly (S) in a stereospecific manner in the absence of ATP to form the actin–myosin complex (A.M), in which the myosin head (catalytic domain, CD, and light-chain domain, LCD, also called lever arm) is straight (Fig. 1). This changes upon ATP (T) binding to the myosin active site (A.M.T), which induces weak binding (W) in the strong-to-weak (S→W) transition, resulting in dissociation of myosin from actin (M.T) (Fig. 2). Subsequent structural changes in myosin reorient the LCD to produce a bent myosin head and ATP hydrolysis (producing M.D.Pi) primes myosin for weak-binding (W) reattachment to actin (A.M.D.Pi) (2Rohde J.A. Thomas D.D. Muretta J.M. Heart failure drug changes the mechanoenzymology of the cardiac myosin powerstroke.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: E1796-E1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This induces the reorientation of the LCD (bent-to-straight) to produce the force-generating powerstroke and subsequent release of Pi to produce the strongly bound (S) A.M.ADP state (3Muretta J.M.

The release of ADP to form the A.M complex completes the actin–myosin ATPase cycle (4Geeves M.A. Review: The ATPase mechanism of myosin and actomyosin.Biopolymers. 2016; 105: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 5Squire J.

Thus, the key actin–myosin interaction during force production, involving the weak-to-strong transition (W→S), can be fine-tuned by changes in either LCD structure (flexibility or axial rotations) or equilibrium/rate constants leading to this transition (6Spudich J.A.

Even more importantly, cardiac actin mutations that appear in the myosin or tropomyosin-binding regions cause either hypertrophic (HCM) or dilated (DCM) cardiomyopathies (11Despond E.A. Dawson J.F.

Also, structural studies show that OM binds to stabilize myosin in a pre-powerstroke state in which the LCD is primed to transition into the powerstroke, which results in an increase in the number of myosins that are actin-attached in a force-producing state (18Planelles-Herrero V.J.

Mava inhibits the actin-activated rates of myosin ATPase activity and phosphate release (12Alsulami K. Marston S.

Mava is in the third phase of clinical trials as a therapeutic for hypercontractility in HCM caused by myosin mutations (22Fumagalli C. De Gregorio M.G. Zampieri M. Fedele E. Tomberli A. Chiriatti C. Marchi A. Olivotto I. Targeted medical therapies for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.Curr. Cardiol. Rep. 2020; 22: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Recently, Mava was also proposed for treatment of HCM caused by mutations in the calcium regulatory thin filament protein troponin (23Sparrow A.J. Watkins H. Daniels M.J. Redwood C. Robinson P. Mavacamten rescues increased myofilament calcium sensitivity and dysregulation of Ca(2+) flux caused by thin filament hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mutations.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2020; 318: H715-H722Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the results of that study were mixed, suggesting that for those troponin-based HCM mutations, Mava would not be a suitable therapeutic candidate. Small-molecule compounds designed for use as drugs to manage specific human diseases may affect other systems in the body, including the cardiovascular system. Therefore, it is important to determine the effects of these compounds on the contractility of cardiac and skeletal muscle. Because actin's role in muscle contractility (both striated and smooth) is regulated by many other proteins such as those in the thin filament (e.g., tropomyosin, troponin, and caldesmon) or the thick filament (e.g., myosin heavy chain, myosin light chains, and myosin binding protein C), it is also important to determine the effects of the actin-binding compounds on the functions of these associated proteins. The focus of the present study is to determine how previously identified actin-binding compounds affect the kinetics of the actin–myosin interaction. A recently engineered biosensor consisting of donor-labeled actin and an acceptor-labeled peptide derived from the N terminus of the myosin essential light chain (ELC) was used in a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) high-throughput screen (HTS) of the NIH Clinical Collection (NCC), a library of compounds with a history of use and safety in human clinical trials (24Guhathakurta P. Prochniewicz E. Grant B.D. Peterson K.C. Thomas D.D. High-throughput screen, using time-resolved FRET, yields actin-binding compounds that modulate actin-myosin structure and function.J. Biol.

Actin-myosin interaction: Structure, function and drug discovery.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 192628Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In that study, ten “hit” compounds (Fig. 3) were found to affect actin–myosin function. These ten compounds were FDA-approved drugs for therapeutic treatment in diverse human diseases (Fig. 3). Car is used as a β-blocker for treatment of hypertension, Dan is used as a skeletal muscle relaxant, and Mef is used as an antimalarial. Thi, Flu, and Phn are used as antipsychotics. Flp, Hon, and Mit are used to treat cancer. Teg has been used to treat irritable bowel syndrome and constipation. However, Thi and Flp are no longer in common use because they cause liver toxicity. Dan also causes hepatoxicity at varying dosage and is under FDA caution for usage (26Utili R. Boitnott J.K. Zimmerman H.J. Dantrolene-associated hepatic injury. Incidence and character.Gastroenterology. 1977; 72: 610-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mit is also under FDA caution as it may contribute to heart failure, and Teg is no longer in use because it can contribute to heart failure. All ten of these compounds significantly decreased the FRET efficiency in the above-described HTS, indicating decreased myosin–actin interaction. Some of the compounds also had significant effects on actin filament flexibility and on steady-state actin-activated myosin S1 ATPase activities (24Guhathakurta P. Prochniewicz E. Grant B.D. Peterson K.C. Thomas D.D. High-throughput screen, using time-resolved FRET, yields actin-binding compounds that modulate actin-myosin structure and function.J. Biol.

Actin-myosin interaction: Structure, function and drug discovery.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 192628Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A subsequent study by the same authors showed that some of these actin-binding compounds have distinct effects on the polymerization properties of skeletal and cardiac actin isoforms and on the steady-state ATPase activities of skeletal and cardiac myofibrillar ATPase activity (27Guhathakurta P. Phung L.A. Prochniewicz E. Lichtenberger S. Wilson A. Thomas D.D. Actin-binding compounds, previously discovered by FRET-based high-throughput screening, differentially affect skeletal and cardiac muscle.J Biol Chem. 2020; 295: 14100-14110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Given the very small sequence differences in structure between cardiac and skeletal muscle actin, this is a surprising finding. This is important because it provided motivation to further investigate the transient kinetics of the actin–myosin interaction, as steady-state kinetics does not provide direct information about fundamental rate and equilibrium constants, which are important for determining therapeutic relevance and providing insights into muscle mechanisms in health and disease. In the present study, we investigate in more detail the mechanisms of action for these actin-binding compounds, focusing on cardiac muscle because of its high-potential therapeutic significance. Specifically, we ask the following question: Which steps early in the actin–myosin ATPase reaction do these compounds affect? A key tool in answering this question is the fluorescence of pyrene-labeled actin, which has been well characterized for detecting the kinetics of strong-binding myosin heads on actin (28Adamek N. Geeves M.A. Use of pyrene-labelled actin to probe actin-myosin interactions: Kinetic and equilibrium studies.Exp. Suppl. 2014; 105: 87-104PubMed Google Scholar). Pyrene iodoacetamide (PIA) covalently binds to cysteine 374 (C374) in F-actin, which is proximal to, but not within, the myosin interaction sites on actin. C374 does not appear to be directly involved in the myosin–actin interaction (29Onishi H. Mikhailenko S.V. Morales M.F. Toward understanding actin activation of myosin ATPase: The role of myosin surface loops.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6136-6141Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but it might be important for monomer-to-monomer contact in the actin filament, because deletion of C374 destabilizes F-actin (30O'Donoghue S.I. Miki M. dos Remedios C.G. Removing the two C-terminal residues of actin affects the filament structure.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Labeling of C374 with PIA, producing pyrene-labeled F-actin (PFA), has no significant effects on the equilibrium or dynamics of myosin's interaction with actin, but when S1 binds to PFA in a strong-binding state, the fluorescence is decreased (quenched) because a local conformational change causes the pyrene moiety to become more accessible to the solution (31Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. The use of actin labelled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide to study the interaction of actin with myosin subfragments and troponin/tropomyosin.Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 32Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Fluorimetry study of N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide-labelled F-actin. Local structural change of actin protomer both on polymerization and on binding of heavy meromyosin.Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The decrease of PFA fluorescence in the presence of a compound indicates that the compound induces a conformational change that increases solvent exposure to the actin-bound pyrene, due to a decreased fraction of actin monomers occupied by strongly bound myosin. In the present study, we first measured the impact of each compound on PFA fluorescence under equilibrium and steady-state conditions, in the absence and presence of bovine cardiac ventricular myosin S1 (β-S1) and ATP. We then used stopped-flow fluorescence to study the transient-state kinetics of the formation of the PFA-S1 complex and the effects of ATP binding to the myosin active site in the presence and absence of the compounds. Specifically, we determined how the compounds affect the binding affinity of actin and S1 in rigor (Fig. 1), the ATP affinity for myosin in the myosin–actin complex, and the subsequent rate of isomerization of the collision complex (A.M.T) to the ternary complex (A∼M.T) (Fig. 2), all of which were monitored by PFA fluorescence. We found that several of these compounds weaken the actin–myosin interaction in rigor, increase the ATP affinity for myosin, and decrease the rate constant of the subsequent isomerization step in the early phase of the ATPase cycle. These results support the hypothesis that actin-binding compounds allosterically affect the actin–myosin interaction by perturbing kinetic constants early in the myosin ATPase cycle. The ratio of bound pyrene to F-actin was 0.95–1.1, consistent with complete and specific reaction at Cys374 (28Adamek N. Geeves M.A. Use of pyrene-labelled actin to probe actin-myosin interactions: Kinetic and equilibrium studies.Exp. Suppl. 2014; 105: 87-104PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine ventricular myosin S1 (0.1 μM) had Mg-ATPase activity of 0.009 ± 0.04 s−1 in the absence of actin and 1.15 ± 0.03 s−1 in the presence of 15 μM phalloidin-stabilized F-actin, consistent with previous results (20Rohde J.A. Roopnarine O. Thomas D.D. Muretta J.M. Mavacamten stabilizes an autoinhibited state of two-headed cardiac myosin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As shown previously (28Adamek N. Geeves M.A. Use of pyrene-labelled actin to probe actin-myosin interactions: Kinetic and equilibrium studies.Exp. Suppl. 2014; 105: 87-104PubMed Google Scholar, 31Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. The use of actin labelled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide to study the interaction of actin with myosin subfragments and troponin/tropomyosin.Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), phalloidin-stabilized PFA has high fluorescence intensity with a maximum at 407 nm (Fig. 4A, black spectrum), and the addition of myosin S1 to pyrene-labeled F-actin linearly decreases the fluorescence intensity (Fig. 4A, green spectrum) until the molar ratio of S1 to Actin is 1, and then it becomes independent of [S1] (Fig. 4B), quenching the fluorescence to ∼23% of the control (no S1). When saturating MgATP binds to myosin's active site, it weakens the interaction of myosin S1 with actin, which results in restoring pyrene fluorescence (Fig. 4, red). Vanadate is a phosphate analog that, together with ADP (when vanadate is added during ATP cycling), traps myosin heads in a weak-binding state similar to the M∗∗.ADP.Pi state (34Goodno C.C. Inhibition of myosin ATPase by vanadate ion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2620-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 35Goodno C.C. Taylor E.W. Inhibition of actomyosin ATPase by vanadate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The addition of saturating vanadate (VO4) to actin.S1, under conditions used in the present study, dissociates most of myosin from actin (35Goodno C.C. Taylor E.W. Inhibition of actomyosin ATPase by vanadate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The formation of the ADP.VO4-S1 complex relieved the S1-induced inhibition of pyrene fluorescence, increasing the value to 85 ± 0.3% of the myosin-free control (Fig. 4B, ). Similarly, the addition of 10 mM potassium pyrophosphate (PPi) to the PFA-S1 almost completely restored pyrene fluorescence (Fig. 4B, ). Pyrophosphate is known to dissociate the rigor actin–myosin complex almost as effectively as MgATP (36Roopnarine O. Thomas D.D.

OM and Mava, which bind specifically to myosin (16Green E.M. Wakimoto H. Anderson R.L. Evanchik M.J. Gorham J.M. Harrison B.C. Henze M. Kawas R. Oslob J.D. Rodriguez H.M. Song Y. Wan W. Leinwand L.A.

The addition of 5 μM OM or Mava did not induce significant changes in the PFA fluorescence, (4% and 1%), respectively (Fig. 5, left, purple and pink bars). When S1 was added (equimolar to actin), the expected decrease in pyrene fluorescence was observed (Fig. 5, middle, green bar), with no effect of OM or Mava (Fig. 5, middle, purple and pink b"

These intervals describe the dispersion of test parameter values of apparently healthy persons in defined populations as health status indicators. Using reference intervals obtained and validated in populations outside the geographical region of derivation for medical decision-making may impact negatively on clinical interpretation and patient management. Many countries have established their reference values, current studies on these data for Nigeria are however scarce. Determination of clinical biochemistry reference intervals for young Nigerian adults which is of particular importance in routine clinical management and conduct of clinical trials in response to existing and emerging diseases will add significantly to the existing body of knowledge. Objective The objective was to establish reference intervals for 24biochemistry analytes among Nigerians aged 18 to 26 years. Methods This was a cross-sectional study among 7,797 consenting male and female military applicants aged 18 to 26 years from 37 States of Nigeria. It was a total study among volunteers for military service. Blood samples were collected and subjected to serological testing for HIV-1 and 2, hepatitis-B, malaria, pregnancy and haematuria to restrict our study population to apparently healthy participants. Biochemical assays were performed on 6,169 participant samples that met the inclusion criteria. Generated data was entered into MS Excel ® and exported into SPSS ® software version 16 for analysis. Statistical tools used were frequencies, median, mid 95 th percentile range with 2.5 th and 97.5 th percentiles as limits. Reference intervals were estimated using nonparametric methods. No intergender statistical comparison was made. Results Complete records were obtained for 6,169 eligible participants. Median values and associated reference intervals were similar in both genders. Conclusion The findings from this study will help in clinical decision-making and play a significant role in supporting the current global rapid expansion of clinical trials in response to the urgent need for preventive and therapeutic solutions to existing and emerging diseases."

We targeted CXCR4 as it is implicated in developmental processes, dopaminergic transmission, neuroimmune responses, and the potentiation of psychostimulant abuse pathology. To evaluate the role of CXCR4 activity on the development of AMPH sensitization, a CXCR4 antagonist (Plerixafor; AMD3100) was administered to rats as a pretreatment variable. Specifically, adolescent Long Evans male rats ( N = 37) were divided into four groups: (1) AMD3100 (IP, 4.0 mg/kg) + AMPH (IP, 4.0 mg/kg), (2) saline (SAL; 0.9% NaCl) + AMPH, (3) AMD3100 + SAL, and (4) SAL + SAL. Animals were first habituated to locomotor activity (LMA) chambers, then injected with a pretreatment drug (AMD3100 or SAL) followed by AMPH or SAL every other for four days. After a one-week withdrawal period, all animals were administered a low challenge dose of AMPH (IP, 1.0 mg/kg). AMPH-injected rats displayed significantly more locomotor activity compared to controls across all testing days. CXCR4 antagonism significantly attenuated AMPH-induced locomotor activity. On challenge day, AMD3100 pre-treated animals exhibited diminutive AMPH-induced locomotor activity compared to SAL pre-treated animals. Postmortem analyses of brain tissue revealed elevated CXCR4 protein levels in the striatum of all experimental groups. Our results implicate CXCR4 signaling in the development of AMPH sensitization and may represent an important therapeutic target for future research in psychostimulant abuse."
https://openalex.org/W3080195806,"Annual recruitment data of new graduates are manually analyzed by human resources specialists (HR) in industries, which signifies the need to evaluate the recruitment strategy of HR specialists. Every year, different applicants send in job applications to companies. The relationships between applicants' attributes (e.g., English skill or academic credential) can be used to analyze the changes in recruitment trends across multiple years' data. However, most attributes are unnormalized and thus require thorough preprocessing. Such unnormalized data hinder the effective comparison of the relationship between applicants in the early stage of data analysis. Thus, a visual exploration system is highly needed to gain insight from the overview of the relationship between applicants across multiple years. In this study, we propose the Polarizing Attributes for Network Analysis of Correlation on Entities Association (Panacea) visualization system. The proposed system integrates a time-varying graph model and dynamic graph visualization for heterogeneous tabular data. Using this system, human resource specialists can interactively inspect the relationships between two attributes of prospective employees across multiple years. Further, we demonstrate the usability of Panacea with representative examples for finding hidden trends in real-world datasets and then describe HR specialists' feedback obtained throughout Panacea's development. The proposed Panacea system enables HR specialists to visually explore the annual recruitment of new graduates."
https://openalex.org/W3130675975,"Objective Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is highly prevalent among cancer survivors, which may have long-term effects on physical activity and quality of life. CRF is assessed by self-report or clinical observation, which may limit timely diagnosis and management. In this study, we examined the effect of CRF on mobility performance measured by a wearable pendant sensor. Methods This is a secondary analysis of a clinical trial evaluating the benefit of exercise in cancer survivors with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). CRF status was classified based on a Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) score ≤ 33. Among 28 patients (age = 65.7±9.8 years old, BMI = 26.9±4.1kg/m 2 , sex = 32.9%female) with database variables of interest, twenty-one subjects (75.9%) were classified as non-CRF. Mobility performance, including behavior (sedentary, light, and moderate to vigorous activity (MtV)), postures (sitting, standing, lying, and walking), and locomotion (e.g., steps, postural transitions) were measured using a validated pendant-sensor over 24-hours. Baseline psychosocial, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General (FACT-G), Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I), and motor-capacity assessments including gait (habitual speed, fast speed, and dual-task speed) and static balance were also performed. Results Both groups had similar baseline clinical and psychosocial characteristics, except for body-mass index (BMI), FACT-G, FACIT-F, and FES-I ( p &lt;0.050). The groups did not differ on motor-capacity. However, the majority of mobility performance parameters were different between groups with large to very large effect size, Cohen’s d ranging from 0.91 to 1.59. Among assessed mobility performance, the largest effect sizes were observed for sedentary-behavior ( d = 1.59, p = 0.006), light-activity ( d = 1.48, p = 0.009), and duration of sitting+lying ( d = 1.46, p = 0.016). The largest correlations between mobility performance and FACIT-F were observed for sitting+lying (rho = -0.67, p &lt;0.001) and the number of steps per day (rho = 0.60, p = 0.001). Conclusion The results of this study suggest that sensor-based mobility performance monitoring could be considered as a potential digital biomarker for CRF assessment. Future studies warrant evaluating utilization of mobility performance to track changes in CRF over time, response to CRF-related interventions, and earlier detection of CRF."
https://openalex.org/W3135674519,"Given the constant high prevalence of cannabis use and cannabis dependence, it is important to determine protective behaviors on the individual level, which buffer the effects of risk factors. Protective Behavioral Strategies for Marijuana (PBSM) have been identified to play an important role for harm reduction in adolescent and young adult users. In the present study, we analyzed if PBSM moderate the effects of use motives (captured by the Marijuana Motives Measure, MMM) on the severity of dependence beyond the effects of age, gender, education and cannabis use frequency. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the German versions of PBSM and MMM. Data was gathered in an online survey distributed to randomly chosen households in the city of Bern in the German speaking part of Switzerland. The final sample comprised 362 past-month users. Results showed negative correlations between PBSM and cannabis use frequency and severity of dependence. The only motives being correlated with severity of dependence were coping and routine, beyond frequency of use. PBSM significantly moderated the effect only of routine motives on the severity of dependence. However, only a few cases who used PBSM extensively were affected. PBSM appear to be an important factor to reduce harm among past-month users but not among those with dependent use patterns, e.g. coping and routine users. Clinical implications are discussed. The routine factor adds significantly to the MMM and should be implemented and improved in future studies. PBSM as well as the MMM can be used in future studies in German speaking populations."

We thus envisioned that C1 could be used to facilitate 4-HPA detection. The proposed test protocol is simple and in situ and involves addition of NADH to C1 in solution, with or without 4-HPA, and direct acquisition of the H2O2 current with an immersed Prussian Blue–coated screen-printed electrode (PB-SPE) assembly.

Binding of an activator or inhibitor to the enzyme and a subsequent conformational change affect substrate/protein interaction either through changes in binding affinity (“K-systems”) or in turnover rate (“V-systems”). Allosteric enzymes thereby synchronize complex cellular metabolic pathways through positive or negative feedback and mediate neuronal and endocrine chemical cell signaling (5Changeux J.-P.

Recently, technological biocatalysis, using enzymes for green and sustainable chemical synthesis, has begun to explore allosteric features of native or genetically engineered protein catalysts in industrial process design, with enhanced yields, purity, and structural integrity of the product (10Fastrez J.

Similarly, allosteric enzymes have been suggested as signal-generating elements of biosensors in the analysis of the products of enzymic processes, disease biomarkers and soil, water, air, and food pollutants (13Villaverde A. Allosteric enzymes as biosensors for molecular diagnosis.FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Electroanalysis of reactants is the basis of the widely used clinical and home-care blood glucose meters that use strip-like sensor platforms with glucose oxidase on the working electrodes for amperometric sample testing (14Wang J. Electrochemical glucose biosensors.Chem. Rev. 2008; 108: 814-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar). However, even 60 years after Clark and Lyon’s influential launch of amperometric glucose biosensing (15Clark L.C. Lyons C. Electrode systems for continuous monitoring in cardiovascular surgery.Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1962; 102: 29-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar), the potential of this simple methodology has not yet exploited allosteric enzymes. The potential advantage of using allosteric enzymes as chemically tunable biological recognition elements on electrodes is that the activity of the immobilized signalling protein, and thus the sensor current, is altered by an activating or inhibiting modulator. The dependence of the allosteric effect on modulator concentration also permits assay of the allosteric modulator, widening the range of analytical applicability. Despite this useful practical feature, electrochemical biosensing with allosteric enzymes remains an underdeveloped practice, and the few published examples either work with rather complex designs of the sensor readout or require specially synthesized nanomaterials as components of the immobilization matrix in order to generate an adequate signal (16Wollenberger U.

Thus, the utilization of allosteric enzymes on electrode surfaces and the design of simple and sustainable strategies for allosteric electrochemical assays of substrate or effector is a topical issue, with many methodological opportunities. Cheap, computerized devices for electroanalysis are now on the market and, in the case of compact cigarette-box-sized amplifiers, have the advantages of portability and a small bench footprint. Combining miniaturized apparatus with amperometric biosensing by natural or genetically modified allosteric enzymes may lead to novel analytical solutions for biomarker, drug, and environmental pollutant testing. With the above considerations in mind, we studied the allosteric reductase subunit C1 of a hydroxylase from soil-based Acinetobacter baumannii (22Chaiyen P. Suadee C. Wilairat P.

This has an FMN prosthetic group and oxidizes NADH to NAD+; in the holo-enzyme it is reoxidized by the C2 subunit, which hydroxylates 4-HPA, but in the absence of C2, the reduced prosthetic group can be reoxidized by molecular oxygen, a reaction that is allosterically activated by 4-HPA. C1 was used as a model allosteric enzyme in the nonoptical assay of NADH oxidation by cathodic H2O2 amperometry, in a high-sensitivity, interference-free assay. This simple electroanalytic procedure could also be used to measure the enhancement of the rate of enzymic NADH oxidation by known allosteric activators of C1, to assess the relative strength of allosteric modulation by 4-HPA and structurally similar phenolic compounds, and provide a simple assay for the effector. 4-HPA is recognized as a urinary indicator for dysbiosis (26Sarosiek I.

The proven quality of the proposed amperometric C1 activity assay is thus an important advance toward simple and cheap 4-HPA biomarker analysis in urine samples, with a potential for monitoring clinical health and personal well-being. Apart from the possibility of an effective 4-HPA assay, the novel bioelectrochemical methodology may also serve as a complementary means of NADH detection, an optional screening tool for performance tests with genetically engineered allosteric C1 variants, and with suitable adaptations, a tactic for work with other allosteric redox enzymes. The substrate of C1 is the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), which is oxidized to NAD+. As the reaction typically takes place in an aerobic environment, redox recycling of C1 occurs through electron transfer to dissolved oxygen, with production of hydrogen peroxide, which, due to its ambivalent redox character, can be quantified by anodic oxidation or cathodic reduction. In an initial test, CI in solution was assayed using a platinum disk working electrode (WE) operated in amperometric anodic oxidation mode with a detection potential of +600 mV versus the reference electrode (RE) and challenged with successive additions of small aliquots of the C1 effector 4-HPA, the C1 substrate NADH, and the reaction product H2O2. Increased anodic currents were detected not only with addition of the diagnostic target H2O2 but also with 4-HPA and NADH (Fig. 1A). The initial test was then repeated with a Prussian Blue (PB)-modified screen-printed carbon disk electrode (PB-SPE) WE as the H2O2 sensor with a detection potential of –100 mV versus RE. In contrast to the signal pattern seen in the anodic test with a Pt-disk WE, a measurable current, now for cathodic reduction, was seen with the analyte H2O2, but not with the effector 4-HPA or the substrate NADH (Fig. 1B). With response times below 10 s, single H2O2 concentration increases as low as 2 μM led to reproducible and easily analyzed stepwise increases in cathodic sensor current (Fig. 1C). The response of cathodic PB-SPEs to H2O2 was reliably linear up to around 2000 μM, with a sensitivity of 0.01 μA μM-1, while at higher analyte levels, the curve approached a plateau, due to signal saturation (Fig. 1D). The analytical performance of PB-SPE-based H2O2 amperometry was further tested with quantitative assays of the target in model samples. In triplicate repetitions of measurements in the standard addition mode, the concentration of 100 μM H2O2 in the model samples showed an acceptable recovery of (109.0 ± 2)% (Fig. 2). Cathodic H2O2 amperometry with PB-SPEs polarized at –100 mV versus RE was expected to reliably report production of H2O2 from O2, on oxidation of NADH to NAD+ by the allosterically-activated C1 subunit. A set of four amperometric PB-SPE recordings was carried out to confirm that the electrochemical method could also report the marked difference between the turnover rates of C1 with and without addition of the effector 4-HPA. In initial control runs with only enzyme or only NADH added to the electrolyte, no rise of cathodic current above residual level was detected (Fig. 3, solid and dotted black traces). On the other hand, a constantly increasing cathodic sensor current was observed when 50 μM NADH was added to buffer containing 1 μM C1 (Fig. 3, blue trace). The immediate signal increase on addition of the substrate visualized the onset and continuation of enzymic H2O2 production. The final steady current indicated complete consumption of NADH, with a stable H2O2 solution concentration corresponding to the added substrate concentration. Establishing a screen for allosteric enzyme activation was a further goal, and the last test was for a measurable increase in the rate of change of the the H2O2 current when the effector 4-HPA was added to the trial buffer before the substrate NADH (Fig. 3, red trace). The slopes of the traces indicate the rate of H2O2 production and thus correspond to the normal (Fig. 3, blue trace) and accelerated (Fig. 3, red trace) rates of NADH oxidation by C1. Under the conditions of the trial allosteric activation by 4-HPA produced an almost 12-fold increase in the turnover rate of C1. The observation of a linear correlation between NADH oxidation by C1 and the increase in H2O2 concentration in the reaction buffer solution allowed cathodic H2O2 amperometry at PB-SPEs to be used for the quantification of NADH in the media. In test trials, 1 μM C1 was dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 7) and 100 μM 4-HPA was added to produce allosteric activation of the enzyme. Sequential additions of NADH to the test solution produced a series of stepped increases in the cathodic WE current (Fig. 4A). Plots of the background-corrected current step magnitudes against the actual NADH concentration were linear up to about 600 μM, while above this limit the current traces approached a maximum through C1 saturation with substrate (Fig. 4B). Using additions of 50 μM NADH, quantification was performed in the standard addition mode (Fig. 4, C and D). Triplicate repetition of the analysis of the 50 μM model sample revealed an acceptable recovery (109.2 ± 2.5%, n = 3) of the adjusted concentration. The practical limit of detection (LOD) of amperometric NADH biosensing with dissolved C1 was 2 μM. The previous section verified that the proposed electrochemical methodology was sufficiently fast and sensitive to monitor in situ generation of H2O2 by C1-catalyzed oxidation of NADH and to differentiate reaction rates with and without allosteric activation. Because the allosteric effect is produced by binding of the effector to a regulatory site on the enzyme, it was expected to show concentration dependence and saturation, and the rate of H2O2 generation, reflected in the slopes of the H2O2 current recordings, increased with increased concentration of 4-HPA in the measuring buffer (Fig. 5A). Increasing concentrations of the allosteric effector produced a linear increase in rate up to about 100 μM and then a gradual approach to a plateau as the effector-binding sites became saturated (Fig. 5B). The data were fitted with the Michaelis–Menten function, the maximum rate of H2O2 production being 37 nA s-1 and the apparent Kd (effector concentration for half-maximal activation) 103 μM. The lowest 4-HPA concentration to produce a measurable increase in the rate of NADH oxidation was 1 μM. The discovery of effective allosteric regulators of an enzyme such as the reductase studied here and a comparison of their activatory or inhibitory effects are important considerations when the protein is being exploited for biotechnological, biomedical, or analytical purposes. Cathodic H2O2 amperometry at PB-SPEs has therefore been used to assess the allosteric interaction with C1 of four phenolic compounds with structural similarity to the most potent known activator, 4-HPA (22Chaiyen P.

This trial involved the 2- and 3-isomers of 4-HPA, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenylacetate, and 3(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionate. As shown in the amperometric recordings in Figure 6, the compounds studied can be divided into three groups, with weak, moderate, or strong ability to activate NADH oxidation by C1, compared with the activity in the absence of any modulator. 4-HPA was identified as the most effective activator, followed by 3-HPA. 2-HPA, on the other hand, had almost no effect on the turnover rate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenylacetate and 3-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-propionate were moderately effective. The molecular affinities for C1 of the five phenolic compounds that had been electrochemically screened were also evaluated by ITC (33Ladbury J.E. Application of isothermal titration calorimetry in the biological Sciences: Things are heating up!.BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 885-887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a routine, the phenol derivatives were used to fill the ITC syringe and to titrate C1 solution in the ITC sample cell. Figure 7 shows examples of thermograms obtained during the ITC trials, together with the corresponding plots of the integrated heat of the thermogram troughs for particular injections versus the molar ratio between the phenolic ligand and its binding partner C1. The values of the related stoichiometries (N), reaction enthalpy (ΔH°), the Gibb’s free energy (ΔG°), the entropy term (-TΔS°), and the dissociation constant (Kd) were extracted from the heat plots of phenol/C1 interactions, using the One Set of Sites Model.

Redox enzymes fulfill essential physiological functions through their involvement in cellular metabolism, cell proliferation, growth, and apoptosis and also in cell-to-cell communication, while some isolated native or genetically engineered redox enzymes are used in the food, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology industries for chemical synthesis. Redox enzymes are also used as specific biosensors in clinical diagnostics and environmental and pharmaceutical analysis. For such applications, redox enzymes with allosteric binding sites that modulate their activity may offer strategies for optimization of process efficiency or biosensor performance. Because redox enzyme activity results in the appearance of electroactive chemical species, electrochemical analysis is a convenient and cost-effective alternative to spectroscopic biochemical assays for testing the potency of allosteric effectors of a biocatalyst and for assessing the concentration dependence of allosteric effects. Here, the allosterically activated reductase C1 subunit of 4-hydroxy-phenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from A. baumannii served as a model for which an amperometric readout of activity could be established. A hurdle for realization of the methodology was the shared tendency to oxidation of the C1 substrate NADH, its phenolic allosteric activators and H2O2, the product of C1 reoxidation by O2 during conversion of NADH to NAD+. Accordingly, useful H2O2 current signals following enzymic NADH oxidation could not be acquired using anodic detection (Fig. 1A). However, interference was avoided with cathodic determination of H2O2 at the surface of screen-printed carbon electrodes that carried a PB coating as a catalyst for H2O2 reduction. The complete absence of substrate and effector reduction (Fig. 1B) and a reducing current response proportional to H2O2 concentration (Figs. 1C and 2) allowed cathodic PB-SPEs to be used in electrochemical assays of C1 activity (Fig. 3). Their satisfactory performance and potential for sensitive C1 activity screening were verified with 1 μM C1, activated with 100 μM 4-HPA, in which the response of PB-SPEs to increasing concentrations of NADH was calibrated by NADH quantification in the standard addition mode (Fig. 4). The signal proportionality (up to 600 μM NADH) and recovery of 50 μM NADH in prepared model samples (better than 110%) replicated the analytical figures of merit of recently introduced amperometric biosensors with fully 4-HPA-activated C1 immobilized in a thin-film electrode redox polymer coating (20Teanphonkrang S. Janke S. Chaiyen P. Sucharitakul J. Suginta W. Khunkaewla P. Schuhmann W. Ruff A. Schulte A.

Chem. 2018; 90: 5703-5711Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The practical limit of NADH detection (LOD) of amperometric NADH biosensing with dissolved (here) and immobilized C1 (20Teanphonkrang S. Janke S. Chaiyen P. Sucharitakul J. Suginta W. Khunkaewla P.

The lower LOD for the electrochemical bioassay with dissolved C1 was likely to be because NADH had freer access to C1 in solution than with the reductase immobilized within the redox polymer. It is worth mentioning that use of C1 as an immobilized element of redox polymer-based biosensors, as proposed in earlier published work (20Teanphonkrang S. Janke S. Chaiye"

In Escherichia coli, NupG mediates the transport of nucleosides and was deemed to be the prototype of the nucleoside proton symporter (NHS) family and the major facilitator superfamily. To date, the substrate recognition and transport mechanisms of NHS transporters are still elusive. Here, we report two crystal structures of NupG (WT and D323A NupG) resolved at 3.0 Å. Both structures reveal an identical inward-open conformation. Together with molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations and in vitro uridine-binding assays, we found that the uridine binding site, which locates in the central cavity between N and C domains of NupG, is constituted by R136, T140, F143, Q225, N228, Q261, E264, Y318, and F322. Moreover, we found that D323 is very important for substrate binding via in vitro uridine-binding assays using D323 mutations, although it does not have a direct contact with uridine. Our structural and biochemical data therefore provide an important framework for the mechanistic understanding of nucleoside transporters of the NHS family.

Nucleosides play important roles in all organisms on Earth. In addition to being the basic components of nucleic acids, they are also neurotransmitters for signaling translocation (1Parkinson F.E.

In addition, nucleoside analogs have been suggested to be antiviral and anticancer drugs and compounds with great antibiotic activity (3Serpi M. Ferrari V. Pertusati F.

Nucleoside homeostasis, which is mediated by nucleoside uptake and export via transporters, is essential for cell division and growth (4Molina-Arcas M. Casado F.J. Pastor-Anglada M. Nucleoside transporter proteins.Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2009; 7: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To date, two kinds of nucleoside transporters have been found in mammals: concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs) and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (5Young J.D. Yao S.Y. Baldwin J.M.

Interestingly, the nucleoside-specific outer membrane transporter Tsx and the nucleoside proton symporter (NHS) NupG are restricted in bacteria (6Nieweg A. Bremer E.

The NHS NupG belongs to the NHS family in the major facilitate superfamily (MFS) and has been recognized as one of the prototype MFS transporters (9Cabrita M.A. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Molecular biology and regulation of nucleoside and nucleobase transporter proteins in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The major facilitator superfamily (MFS) is the largest protein family of transporters, which facilitate the uptake and export of various molecules across the plasma membrane (10Quistgaard E.M. Low C.

According to their various coupling patterns, MFS transporters can be divided into three kinds of transporters: facilitators, symporters, and antiporters (11Yan N. Structural biology of the major facilitator superfamily transporters.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2015; 44: 257-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

In Escherichia coli, nucleosides are mainly delivered via NupC and NupG (23Munch-Petersen A. Mygind B. Nicolaisen A. Pihl N.J.

Here, we report two crystal structures of the NHS transporter NupG (both at a resolution of 3.0 Å). Together with the in vitro binding assay, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identified the substrate-binding site of NupG. Moreover, we found that a negatively charged residue (D323), which indirectly coordinates with uridine, is also very important for substrate binding. This study provides an important framework for the mechanistic understanding of nucleoside recognition of NHS nucleoside transporters. We overexpressed and purified recombinant NupG with monodisperse peaks in different detergent micelles (Fig. S1). To validate the function of NupG, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was carried out to measure the binding between NupG and nucleosides (Fig. 1). As shown in the results, NupG binds to adenosine with a Kd of 99.67 ± 14.57 μM. NupG also binds to guanosine, thymidine, cytidine, and uridine with Kd values of 46.67 ± 6.66 μM, 162.5 ± 19.16 μM, 143.67 ± 19.66 μM, and 199.67 ± 15.01 μM, respectively. Nevertheless, NupG could not bind to xanthosine (Fig. 1, Table S1), and this was also observed in a previous biochemical study (30Norholm M.H. Dandanell G. Specificity and topology of the Escherichia coli xanthosine permease, a representative of the NHS subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We further detected the binding affinity between NupG and uridine in different buffers at various pH values. NupG binds uridine with a binding affinity of approximately 200 μM in sodium citrate at pH 5.0 and 2-(N-Morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) at pH 6.0, whereas the binding affinity dramatically reduced to approximately 3 mM in a buffer containing 25-mM Tris at pH 8.0 (Fig. S2, Table S1). A previous study reported that NupG has the capacity to transport various nucleosides (25Xie H. Patching S.G. Gallagher M.P. Litherland G.J. Brough A.R. Venter H. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Young J.D. Herbert R.B. Henderson P.J. Baldwin S.A. Purification and properties of the Escherichia coli nucleoside transporter NupG, a paradigm for a major facilitator transporter sub-family.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that NupG has broad substrate selectivity and are consistent with results from a reported transport assay. We used X-ray crystallography to explore the substrate recognition mechanism of NupG. Extensive crystallization trials of NupG were carried out. Finally, we crystallized WT NupG and solved the structure of NupG in the apo state at a resolution of 3.0 Å (Fig. 2, Table S2). We used the molecular replacement method using the predicted structure as the search model to determine the structure of NupG (Fig. S3C). Briefly, we crystallized NupG in two different space groups and collected diffraction data sets at 3.8 Å for P21 and 3.0 Å for P1. We succeeded in solving the structure of NupG with the P21 space group using molecular replacement as there was only one molecule in one asymmetric unit. In the P1 crystal, however, there are two molecules of NupG with reversed orientations in one asymmetric unit (Fig. S3A), and both molecules have an almost identical conformation with an RMSD of 0.21 Å over 387 Cα atoms (Fig. S3B). Therefore, we selected molecule A for further analyses. Consistent with the topology prediction (25Xie H. Patching S.G. Gallagher M.P. Litherland G.J. Brough A.R. Venter H. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M.

Chem. 2005; 3: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), NupG has the typical MFS fold with 12 transmembrane helices (TM1-12). The N domain (TM1-6) and C domain (TM7-12) are linked by a flexible loop (Fig. 2A). The cavity between the N and C domains faces the cytoplasm (Fig. 2B). By comparing the NupG structure with well-characterized MFS transporters that have an inward-open conformation, XylE (17Sun L. Zeng X. Yan C. Sun X. Gong X. Rao Y. Yan N. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of glucose transporters GLUT1-4.Nature. 2012; 490: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and LacY (12Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Structure and mechanism of the lactose permease of Escherichia coli.Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar), we found that NupG also has an inward-open conformation in the crystal structure (Fig. 2B). After extensive trials, we still failed to obtain a crystal of NupG in complex with a nucleoside. Fortunately, polar substrate-binding pockets were identified in previous studies of the MFS transporters XylE and LacY (12Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Structure and mechanism of the lactose permease of Escherichia coli.Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar, 13Kumar H. Kasho V. Smirnova I. Finer-Moore J.S.

Yan N. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of glucose transporters GLUT1-4.Nature. 2012; 490: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The ribose moieties of nucleosides are polar carbohydrates that are structurally similar to the natural substrates of XylE (xylose) and LacY (lactose). We speculated that all three transporters partly share a similar substrate recognition pattern. Several polar or charged residues in the cavity should directly contact the polar carbohydrate. Therefore, the polar and charged residues in the cavity may also be important for nucleoside recognition by NupG. To identify the residues involved in substrate binding, we first investigated several polar residues (Q225, N228, E264, and D323) in the cavity of NupG (Fig. 3A). Mutants were generated, and the uridine binding of these constructs was detected via ITC. As shown in the results, Q225A had a similar binding affinity for uridine (Kd at 227.67 ± 88.34 μM) as WT NupG, whereas N228A and E264A dramatically reduced the uridine-binding ability, suggesting that N228 and E264 are essential for nucleoside binding. Surprisingly, NupGD323A bound to uridine with a Kd of 9.67 ± 2.87 μM, which is a 20-fold increase in the binding affinity compared with that of NupGWT (Fig. 3B, Table S1). Considering the increased uridine-binding capacity of NupGD323A, we crystallized NupGD323A under nucleoside-containing conditions and solved the structure of NupGD323A at a resolution of 3.0 Å (Table S2). The superposition of the NupGD323A and NupGWT structures showed that they had identical conformations, with an RMSD of 0.3 Å over 384 Cα atoms (Fig. S3D). Unfortunately, no visible electron density of uridine was observed in the central cavity (Fig. S3E). We continued to explore the nucleoside-binding site of NupG via molecular docking (Fig. 4). Considering the higher binding affinity between NupGD323A and uridine, we first generated a uridine docking model based on the NupGD323A structure using Discovery Studio 3.5 software (Fig. 4A). Then, we confirmed the stability of the system by analyzing a series of conventional structural convergence parameters based on the MD simulation trajectory (Fig. 4B). As shown in Figure 4B, the potential energy reaches equilibrium soon after removing the constraints, and its mean value and SD are −8.93 × 105 and 0.07 × 105 kcal mol−1, respectively; the uridine-bound system tends to be stable after 10 ns with an RMSD of 0.19 ± 0.08 nm; according to the change in the gyration radius over the simulation time, the system tends to equilibrate after 30 ns, with a small fluctuation in the amplitude (approximately 0.01 nm), which indicates that the system experienced a slight expansion and contraction during this period; regarding the distribution of the RMSF on different amino acid residue Cα atoms, the overall RMSF value is low and the atomic motion range is not large. All the above simulation results suggest that uridine-bound NupG is relatively stable. In the uridine-bound model, the uridine molecule was docked into the central cavity, which has direct contact with the side chains of residues from the N and C domains (Fig. 4A). Nucleosides are comprised of two basic components, namely, the ribose and base. In the docking model, R136 and T140 from the N domain and E264 from the C domain form hydrogen bonds with the ribose moiety of uridine. Interestingly, these three residues are identical in three members of the NHS family (NupG, XapB, and YegT). These three transporters have different nucleoside selectivity, but this is understandable for the recognition of invariable ribose by identical residues in the cavity of NHS transporters. The further ConSurf evolutionary analysis using 150 homologs of NupG also reveals that R136, T140, and E264 are highly conserved (Fig. S6). Furthermore, Q225, N228, Q261, and Y318 from the C domain form hydrogen bonds with the base of uridine. Unlike the contact with ribose, the residues involving base recognition are relatively variable. With the exception of Q261, the Q225, N228, and Y318 residues of NupG are A226, Y310, and H315 in YegT (Fig. S5).The conservation scores of Q225 and N228 are 6 and 7, respectively, as shown by the ConSurf evolutionary analysis (Fig. S6). This observation indicates that these residues determine the specifications of nucleoside recognition. In addition, there are two conserved aromatic residues around uridine (Fig. 4A, Fig. S6). To further verify the docking results, in vitro binding assays were carried out. We constructed a series of single point mutations of NupG: R136A, T140A, F143A, Q225A, N228A, Q261A, E264A, Y318A, and F322A. As the ITC results showed, all mutant versions of NupG, except NupGQ225A, abolished the binding affinity between NupG and uridine (Fig. 5, Table S1). This result indicated that the hydrogen-bound interactions between these residues and uridine are essential for substrate recognition. Interestingly, F143A and F322A also eliminated the binding affinity between NupG and uridine, indicating that F143 and F322 are also essential for substrate binding. The surrounding aromatic residues involved in substrate recognition of nucleoside transporters, such as F366 of vcCNT (27Johnson Z.L. Lee J.H. Lee K. Lee M. Kwon D.Y. Hong J. Lee S.Y. Structural basis of nucleoside and nucleoside drug selectivity by concentrative nucleoside transporters.Elife. 2014; 3e03604Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and F564 of hCNT3 (29Zhou Y. Liao L. Wang C. Li J. Chi P. Xiao Q. Liu Q. Guo L. Sun L. Deng D. Cryo-EM structure of the human concentrative nucleoside transporter CNT3.PLoS Biol. 2020; 18e3000790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are a common feature. F143 and F322 might form π–π interactions with uridine and restrict the specific orientation of the nucleosides. In a previous study, N114 was predicted to be important in the recognition of nucleoside transport by NupG (31Patching S.G. Baldwin S.A. Baldwin A.D. Young J.D. Gallagher M.P. Henderson P.J.

However, in our study, N114 is far away from uridine. In addition, N114A also did not influence the binding affinity between NupG and uridine (Fig. S4B). In the structure of NupG, N114 is in TM4 and corresponds to E126 in LacY, which is indispensable for substrate binding and might form a charge pair with R144 of LacY (12Abramson J. Smirnova I.

Interestingly, there are three NHS transporters, NupG (8Westh Hansen S.E. Jensen N. Munch-Petersen A. Studies on the sequence and structure of the Escherichia coli K-12 nupG gene, encoding a nucleoside-transport system.Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), XapB (34Seeger C. Poulsen C. Dandanell G. Identification and characterization of genes (xapA, xapB, and xapR) involved in xanthosine catabolism in Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5506-5516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and YegT (9Cabrita M.A. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. Molecular biology and regulation of nucleoside and nucleobase transporter proteins in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 80: 623-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), that are found in E. coli. XapB shares 58% sequence identity and 76% sequence similarity with NupG (Fig. S5) and was identified as a xanthosine-specific transporter (30Norholm M.H. Dandanell G. Specificity and topology of the Escherichia coli xanthosine permease, a representative of the NHS subfamily of the major facilitator superfamily.J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4900-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar); however, the natural substrate of YegT should be further investigated, although YegT shares 27% sequence identity and 50% sequence similarity with NupG (Fig. S5). The residues involved in the uridine binding pocket of NupG are identical to those of XapB. A previous biochemical study suggested that the preferred substrate of XapB is xanthosine, whereas NupG could not bind or transport xanthosine (Fig. 1). Therefore, other residues surrounding the pocket also contribute to substrate recognition. During this study, we found that the D323A mutant enhances the binding affinity between NupG and uridine (Fig. 2B). This result indicated that D323 is an important residue for nucleoside transport, although D323 does not directly contact the substrate-binding site. Further investigations showed that the D323A mutant maintained a similar uridine-binding affinity in different buffers with various pH values, while NupGWT decreased its binding affinity at a basic pH (Fig. S2) (Fig. S4). This property is similar to that of the mutated lactose proton symporter LacY E325A (35Smirnova I. Kasho V. Sugihara J. Choe J.Y. Kaback H.R. Residues in the H+ translocation site define the pKa for sugar binding to LacY.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Grytsyk N. Sugihara J. Kaback H.R. Hellwig P. pKa of Glu325 in LacY.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the case of LacY, E325 and K319 were identified as protonation sites, and the uncharged side chains of E325 and K319 retain a high affinity with lactose, even at an alkaline pH (35Smirnova I. Kasho V. Sugihara J. Choe J.Y. Kaback H.R. Residues in the H+ translocation site define the pKa for sugar binding to LacY.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 8852-8860Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 36Grytsyk N. Sugihara J. Kaback H.R. Hellwig P. pKa of Glu325 in LacY.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 1530-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that D323 may be the proton-escaping site of NupG during the proton-coupling procedure. Interestingly, NupGD323N, which mimics the protonation state at position 323, bound to uridine with a reducing Kd of 1109 ± 192.21 μM (Fig. S4B, Table S1). Therefore, more structural and biochemical investigations should be carried out to elucidate how D323 couples substrate binding and protonation. In this study, we solved the first structure of an NHS transporter NupG. Together with the MD simulations and biochemical assays, we identified the nucleoside binding site of NupG. Our study provides a framework for understanding the transport and substrate recognition mechanisms of NHS transporters. Full-length nupG was cloned from E. coli K12 and subcloned into pET21b. Overexpression of NupG was induced in E. coli C43(DE3) cells by 0.2-mM IPTG when the cell density reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.0. After incubation for 15 h at 18 °C, the cells were harvested and homogenized in the buffer containing 25-mM MES (pH 6.0) and 150- mM NaCl. The membranes were collected and incubated for 2 h with 2% (w/v) dodecyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DDM, Anatrace) at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 17,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatant was collected and loaded onto Ni-NTA affinity resin (Qiagen) and rinsed with the buffer containing 25-mM MES (pH 6.0), 150-mM NaCl, 20-mM imidazole, and 0.02% DDM. The protein was eluted with a buffer containing 25-mM MES (pH 6.0), 150-mM NaCl, 250-mM imidazole and 0.4% NG. The protein was concentrated to approximately 20 mg/ml before further purification by gel filtration (Superdex200 10/300 increase column; GE Healthcare) in the buffer containing 25-mM MES (pH 6.0), 150-mM NaCl, and 0.4% NG. The peak fractions were collected and concentrated to approximately 30 mg/ml for further crystallization. For the binding assay, NupG was purified in the buffer containing 0.02% DDM in all steps. All mutations were generated by standard two-step PCR and purified using the same protocol. Both WT and D323A NupG were crystallized by the meso-phase method (37Caffrey M. Cherezov V. Crystallizing membrane proteins using lipidic mesophases.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 706-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 38Ma P. Weichert D. Aleksandrov L.A. Jensen T.J. Riordan J.R. Liu X. Kobilka B.K. Caffrey M. The cubicon method for concentrating membrane proteins in the cubic mesophase.Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12: 1745-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A total of 30 mg/ml protein was mixed with monoolein (M-239, Nu-Chek) at a 1:1.5 protein to lipid ratio (w/w) using a syringe lipid mixer. Briefly, the 60 nl of the meso phase was covered with 600 nl of crystallization buffer for each condition and sealed in glass sandwich plates (Shanghai FAstal BioTech). Crystals grew at 1 week in 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.0) and 28% PEG300 for WT NupG P21 structure, in 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M MgCl2, 0.1 M sodium citrate (pH 5.0), and 30% PEG600 for WT NupG P1 structure, and in 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1 M MgCl2, 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0), and 30% PEG550 MME for NupGD323A. Crystals were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The diffraction data were collected at the beamline BL18U1 of SSRF and processed with XDS (39Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10040) Google Scholar). The data were scaled by using Aimless in the CCP4 program suite (40Winn M.D. Ballard C.C. Cowtan K.D. Dodson E.J. Emsley P. Evans P.R. Keegan R.M. Krissinel E.B. Leslie A.G. McCoy A. McNicholas S.J. Murshudov G.N. Pannu N.S. Potterton E.A. Powell H.R. et al.Overview of the CCP4 suite and current developments.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (8405) Google Scholar). The WT NupG structure was solved by molecular replacement using the predicted structure of NupG as the search model. First, the predicted structure of NupG was generated using the Robetta server (http://robetta.bakerlab.org) (41Kim D.E. Chivian D. Baker D. Protein structure prediction and analysis using the Robetta server.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The primary predicted model was further modified as polyalanine and divided into the N domain (TM1-6) and C domain (TM7-12) before molecular replacement by phenix.phaser (42McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Phaser crystallographic software.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (13268) Google Scholar, 43Adams P.D.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (14931) Google Scholar). A good initial solution was obtained by using the P121 crystal form data (diffracting to 3.8 Å) (Table S1) with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. After multiple rounds of manual building and refining, the initial model was good enough to generate a molecular replacement solution for data of the P1 crystal form (3 Å) with two NupG molecules in the asymmetric unit. The complete structure of NupG was obtained by using iterative manual building in coot (44Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: Model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (21735) Google Scholar) and refinement in phenix.refine (Table S2). The nucleoside binding of NupG was measured with a MicroCal iTC200 at 25 °C. The purified NupG proteins were concentrated to 40 to 60 μM for ITC. The titration data were analyzed using the one-site binding model, and the first injection was removed. The titration of nucleosides into the buffer was deducted. All the experiments were repeated three times. A representative result was selected to present, and the means ± SD of Kd are calculated and summarized in Table S1. In general, molecular docking has been widely used to describe the “best-fit” orientation of a ligand binding to a particular protein and to predict the complex structure (45Ahmed H. Ihmaid S. Omar A. Shehata M. Rateb H. Zayed M. Ahmed S. Elaasser M. Design, synthesis, molecular docking of new lipophilic acetamide derivatives affording potential anticancer and antimicrobial agents.Bioorg. Chem. 2018; 76: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Here, the uridine molecule was constructed with the ChemBio3D Ultra 12.0 package, and then its energy was minimized under the MM2 force field with an RMS less than 0.0001 kcal mol−1 Å−1. After the optimization of the molecular mechanics, Gaussian 09 (46Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schlegel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Scalmani G. Barone V. Mennucci B. Petersson G.A.

Energy optimization and molecular docking of the target protein (i.e., NupGD323A) were carried out with the Prepare Protein and CDOCKER modules in Discovery Studio 3.5 software, respectively. In addition, the docking center (x: −18.314, y: −15.508, z: 5.605) and search radius (1.2 nm) were both preset. MD simulation at 300 K was performed for NupGD323A with AMBER 18 software (47Case I.Y.B.-S.D.A. Brozell S.R. Cerutti D.S. Cheatham III, T.E. Cruzeiro V.W.D. Darden T.A. Duke R.E. Ghoreishi D.

A total of 9599 water molecules and one sodium molecule were added to the system using the TIP3P water model (49Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. Comparison of simple potential functions for simulating liquid water.J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (27375) Google Scholar) with a box boundary of 8.0 Å. Before the MD simulation, the following two-stage energy optimization method was carried out for NupGD323A: (1) the solute was constrained with a force constant of 500 kcal mol−1 Å−2 containing 3000 steps in the steepest descent and 5000 steps in the conjugate gradient minimization; (2) after removing the geometry constraints, the second optimization was also composed of 3000 steps in the steepest descent and 5000 steps in the conjugate gradient minimization. After energy minimization, the MD simulation was started and was divided into the following two procedures: (1) a 5-ns constrained MD was performed with a constraint force constant of 10 kcal mol−1 Å−2, and the temperature gradually increased from 0 to 300 K; (2) a 50-ns unconstrained productive MD simulation was performed, adopting the SHAKE algorithm (50Ryckaert J.-P.

Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Crossref Scopus (15794) Google Scholar) to constrain the hydrogen atoms. In addition, the nonbonded interaction radius was set as 8 Å, the integration step was set to 2 fs, and the conformational snapshot was collected every 10 ps. Thus, a total of 5500 conformations were selected for the following structural analyses.

https://openalex.org/W3135181232,"Background It is important to evaluate the size of respiratory effort to prevent patient self-inflicted lung injury and ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction. Esophageal pressure (Pes) measurement is the gold standard for estimating respiratory effort, but it is complicated by technical issues. We previously reported that a change in pleural pressure (ΔPpl) could be estimated without measuring Pes using change in CVP (ΔCVP) that has been adjusted with a simple correction among mechanically ventilated, paralyzed pediatric patients. This study aimed to determine whether our method can be used to estimate ΔPpl in assisted and unassisted spontaneous breathing patients during mechanical ventilation. Methods The study included hemodynamically stable children (aged &lt;18 years) who were mechanically ventilated, had spontaneous breathing, and had a central venous catheter and esophageal balloon catheter in place. We measured the change in Pes (ΔPes), ΔCVP, and ΔPpl that was calculated using a corrected ΔCVP (cΔCVP-derived ΔPpl) under three pressure support levels (10, 5, and 0 cmH 2 O). The cΔCVP-derived ΔPpl value was calculated as follows: cΔCVP-derived ΔPpl = k × ΔCVP, where k was the ratio of the change in airway pressure (ΔPaw) to the ΔCVP during airway occlusion test. Results Of the 14 patients enrolled in the study, 6 were excluded because correct positioning of the esophageal balloon could not be confirmed, leaving eight patients for analysis (mean age, 4.8 months). Three variables that reflected ΔPpl (ΔPes, ΔCVP, and cΔCVP-derived ΔPpl) were measured and yielded the following results: -6.7 ± 4.8, − -2.6 ± 1.4, and − -7.3 ± 4.5 cmH2O, respectively. The repeated measures correlation between cΔCVP-derived ΔPpl and ΔPes showed that cΔCVP-derived ΔPpl had good correlation with ΔPes (r = 0.84, p&lt; 0.0001). Conclusions ΔPpl can be estimated reasonably accurately by ΔCVP using our method in assisted and unassisted spontaneous breathing children during mechanical ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W3135699590,"People often express concern for the welfare of farm animals, but research on this topic has relied upon self-report. Facial expressions provide a quantifiable measure of emotional response that may be less susceptible to social desirability bias and other issues associated with self-report. Viewing other humans in pain elicits facial expressions indicative of empathy. Here we provide the first evidence that this measure can also be used to assess human empathetic responses towards farm animals, showing that facial expressions respond reliably when participants view videos of farm animals undergoing painful procedures. Participants (n = 30) were asked to watch publicly sourced video clips of cows and pigs undergoing common management procedures (e.g. disbudding, castration, tail docking) and control videos (e.g. being lightly restrained, standing). Participants provided their subjective rating of the intensity of 5 negative emotions (pain, sadness, anger, fear, disgust) on an 11-point Likert scale. Videos of the participants (watching the animals) were scored for intensity of unpleasantness of the participants' facial expression (also on an 11-point Likert scale) by a trained observer who was blind to treatment. Participants showed more intense facial expressions while viewing painful procedures versus control procedures (mean ± SE Likert; 2.4 ± 0.08 versus 0.6 ± 0.17). Participants who reported more intense negative responses also showed stronger facial expressions (slope ± SE = 0.4 ± 0.04). Both the self-reported and facial measures varied with species and procedure witnessed. These results indicate that facial expressions can be used to assess human-animal empathy."

https://openalex.org/W3134607293,"Infectious endocarditis is a life-threatening disease, and diagnostics are urgently needed to accurately diagnose this disease especially in the case of prosthetic valve endocarditis. We show here that maltohexaose conjugated to indocyanine green (MH-ICG) can detect Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection in a rat model of infective endocarditis. The affinity of MH-ICG to S. aureus was determined and had a Km and Vmax of 5.4 μM and 3.0 X 10-6 μmol/minutes/108 CFU, respectively. MH-ICG had no detectable toxicity to mammalian cells at concentrations as high as 100 μM. The in vivo efficiency of MH-ICG in rats was evaluated using a right heart endocarditis model, and the accumulation of MH-ICG in the bacterial vegetations was 2.5 ± 0.2 times higher than that in the control left ventricular wall. The biological half-life of MH-ICG in healthy rats was 14.0 ± 1.3 minutes, and approximately 50% of injected MH-ICG was excreted into the feces after 24 hours. These data demonstrate that MH-ICG was internalized by bacteria with high specificity and that MH-ICG specifically accumulated in bacterial vegetations in a rat model of endocarditis. These results demonstrate the potential efficacy of this agent in the detection of infective endocarditis."
