https://openalex.org/W2167493116,"Neurospora crassa is a central organism in the history of twentieth-century genetics, biochemistry and molecular biology. Here, we report a high-quality draft sequence of the N. crassa genome. The approximately 40-megabase genome encodes about 10,000 protein-coding genes--more than twice as many as in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and only about 25% fewer than in the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster. Analysis of the gene set yields insights into unexpected aspects of Neurospora biology including the identification of genes potentially associated with red light photobiology, genes implicated in secondary metabolism, and important differences in Ca2+ signalling as compared with plants and animals. Neurospora possesses the widest array of genome defence mechanisms known for any eukaryotic organism, including a process unique to fungi called repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). Genome analysis suggests that RIP has had a profound impact on genome evolution, greatly slowing the creation of new genes through genomic duplication and resulting in a genome with an unusually low proportion of closely related genes."

The presence of these twins is directly related to the nanocrystalline structure, because they are not observed in coarse-grained pure aluminum. We propose a dislocation-based model to explain the preference for deformation twins and stacking faults in nanocrystalline materials. These results underscore a transition from deformation mechanisms controlled by normal slip to those controlled by partial dislocation activity when grain size decreases to tens of nanometers, and they have implications for interpreting the unusual mechanical behavior of nanocrystalline materials."
https://openalex.org/W2070407853,"Leptospirosis is a widely spread disease of global concern. Infection causes flu-like episodes with frequent severe renal and hepatic damage, such as haemorrhage and jaundice. In more severe cases, massive pulmonary haemorrhages, including fatal sudden haemoptysis, can occur. Here we report the complete genomic sequence of a representative virulent serovar type strain (Lai) of Leptospira interrogans serogroup Icterohaemorrhagiae consisting of a 4.33-megabase large chromosome and a 359-kilobase small chromosome, with a total of 4,768 predicted genes. In terms of the genetic determinants of physiological characteristics, the facultatively parasitic L. interrogans differs extensively from two other strictly parasitic pathogenic spirochaetes, Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi, although similarities exist in the genes that govern their unique morphological features. A comprehensive analysis of the L. interrogans genes for chemotaxis/motility and lipopolysaccharide synthesis provides a basis for in-depth studies of virulence and pathogenesis. The discovery of a series of genes possibly related to adhesion, invasion and the haematological changes that characterize leptospirosis has provided clues about how an environmental organism might evolve into an important human pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W1966975175,Plant cells create highly structured microtubule arrays at the cell cortex without a central organizing center to anchor the microtubule ends. In vivo imaging of individual microtubules in Arabidopsis plants revealed that new microtubules are initiated at the cell cortex and exhibit dynamics at both ends. Polymerization-biased dynamic instability at one end and slow depolymerization at the other end result in sustained microtubule migration across the cell cortex by a hybrid treadmilling mechanism. This motility causes widespread microtubule repositioning and contributes to changes in array organization through microtubule reorientation and bundling.
https://openalex.org/W2094572710,"It has been proposed theoretically that the first generation of stars in the Universe (population III) would be as massive as 100 solar masses (100 M(O)), because of inefficient cooling of the precursor gas clouds. Recently, the most iron-deficient (but still carbon-rich) low-mass star--HE0107-5240--was discovered. If this is a population III star that gained its metals (elements heavier than helium) after its formation, it would challenge the theoretical picture of the formation of the first stars. Here we report that the patterns of elemental abundance in HE0107-5240 (and other extremely metal-poor stars) are in good accord with the nucleosynthesis that occurs in stars with masses of 20-130 M(O) when they become supernovae if, during the explosions, the ejecta undergo substantial mixing and fallback to form massive black holes. Such supernovae have been observed. The abundance patterns are not, however, consistent with enrichment by supernovae from stars in the range 130-300 M(O). We accordingly infer that the first-generation supernovae came mostly from explosions of approximately 20-130 M(O) stars; some of these produced iron-poor but carbon- and oxygen-rich ejecta. Low-mass second-generation stars, like HE0107-5240, could form because the carbon and oxygen provided pathways for the gas to cool."

However, the molecular mechanisms by which salicylates exert these anti-diabetic effects are not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the effects of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) on serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) in cells treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307, Ser267, and Ser612 was monitored by immunoblotting with phospho-specific IRS-1 antibodies. In 3T3-L1 and Hep G2 cells, phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 in response to TNF-α treatment correlated with phosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, and degradation of IκBα. Moreover, phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 in embryo fibroblasts derived from either JNK or IKK knockout mice was reduced when compared with that in the wild-type controls. Taken together, these data suggest that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to TNF-α is mediated, in part, by JNK and IKK. Interestingly, aspirin treatment inhibited the phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser307 as well as the phosphorylation of JNK, c-Jun, and degradation of IκBα. Furthermore, other serine kinases including Akt, extracellular regulated kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin, and PKCζ were also activated by TNF-α (as assessed by phospho-specific antibodies). Phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser267 and Ser612 correlated with the activation of these kinases. Phosphorylation of Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin (but not extracellular regulated kinase or PKCζ) in response to TNF-α was inhibited by aspirin treatment. Finally, aspirin rescued insulin-induced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes pretreated with TNF-α. We conclude that aspirin may enhance insulin sensitivity by protecting IRS proteins from serine phosphorylation catalyzed by multiple kinases.

We conclude that aspirin may enhance insulin sensitivity by protecting IRS proteins from serine phosphorylation catalyzed by multiple kinases. It has been known for more than a century that salicylates are able to reduce fasting blood glucose in diabetic patients (1Williamson R. Br. Med. J. 1901; 1: 760-762Google Scholar, 2Reid J. Macdougall A.I. Andrews M.M. Br. Med. J. 1957; 9: 1071-1074Google Scholar, 3Gilgore S.G. Diabetes. 1960; 9: 392-393Google Scholar). The cellular and molecular mechanism of the hypoglycemic activity of aspirin has not been well elucidated. For the mechanism of salicylates activity, several hypotheses were raised 20 years ago explaining the hypoglycemic action. The extra-pancreatic hypothesis, which suggests salicylates action through a pancreatic-independent mechanism (4Baron S.H. Diabetes Care. 1982; 5: 64-71Google Scholar), seems to have become dominant as it has gained substantial support from studies published recently (5Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W.

TNF-α has been reported to inhibit insulin-induced glucose uptake by targeting more than one component in the insulin signaling cascade. These TNF-targeting components include insulin receptor (11Feinstein R. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26055-26058Google Scholar), insulin receptor substrate (IRS) (12Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar, 13Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar), and glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) (14Long S.D. Pekala P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 179-184Google Scholar). Of these targets, IRS proteins have been studied widely as a major target in the TNF-induced insulin resistance. TNF-α has been consistently reported to inhibit insulin signaling by increasing serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins (11Feinstein R. Kanety H. Papa M.Z. Lunenfeld B. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26055-26058Google Scholar, 15Kanety H. Feinstein R. Papa M.Z. Hemi R. Karasik A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23780-23784Google Scholar, 16Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins leads to IRS inhibition through at least two possibilities, which are inhibition of tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 (13Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar, 16Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 29911-29918Google Scholar), and proteasome-mediated degradation of IRS-1 (18Egawa K. Nakashima N. Sharma P.M. Maegawa H. Nagai Y. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Olefsky J.M.

The first possibility is a result of blocking the interaction of IRS-1 and insulin receptor. TNF-α can induce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation through activation of several serine kinases. (a) Activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). It is known that JNK can be activated by TNF-α through induction of ceramide (22Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Google Scholar). JNK was shown to phosphorylate IRS-1 at serine 307 directly (12Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar, 13Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar). (b) Activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Several studies indicate that ERK can phosphorylate IRS-1 at serine residues (23De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Google Scholar, 24De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12939-12947Google Scholar, 25Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Mol.

(c) Activation of protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ). In addition to JNK activation, TNF-induced ceramide is also able to activate PKCζ (27Bourbon N.A. Sandirasegarane L. Kester M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3286-3292Google Scholar, 28Muller G. Ayoub M. Storz P. Rennecke J. Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Google Scholar), an isoform of atypical PKC. PKCζ was reported to phosphorylate IRS-1 at serine residues (29Liu Y.F. Paz K. Herschkovitz A. Alt A. Tennenbaum T. Sampson S.R. Ohba M. Kuroki T. LeRoith D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14459-14465Google Scholar, 30Ravichandran L.V. Esposito D.L. Chen J. Quon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3543-3549Google Scholar). (d) Activation of Akt (PKB). Akt was shown to phosphorylate IRS-1 proteins at four consensus Akt phosphorylation sites (RXRXXS/T) (31Paz K. Liu Y.F. Shorer H. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Quan M. Kanety H. Seger R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28816-28822Google Scholar). (e) Activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Like Akt, mTOR is one of these serine kinases located downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (32Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513Google Scholar). Several studies suggest that mTOR results in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation (19Haruta T. Uno T. Kawahara J. Takano A. Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 783-794Google Scholar, 33Ozes O.N. Akca H. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4640-4645Google Scholar, 34Li J. DeFea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Google Scholar). (f) Activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 is another serine kinase located downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 was shown to phosphorylate IRS-1 in vivo and in vitro (35Eldar-Finkelman H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Google Scholar). (g) Activation of IKK. In our recent study, we showed that IKK phosphorylated IRS-1 at Ser307 (36Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Google Scholar). Although these seven kinases have been shown to be involved in IRS-1 phosphorylation, the results are derived from different assay systems. Activities of these serine kinases have not been collectively examined in a cell treated with TNF-α. It remains to be verified whether all of the seven kinases are activated under the same condition. To understand the molecular mechanism of TNF-induced insulin resistance, we examined six of seven serine kinases listed above in 3T3-L1 and Hep G2 cells after TNF treatment. A role of JNK and IKK in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was a focus in the study. IRS-1 serine phosphorylation was monitored using three phospho-specific IRS-1 antibodies to Ser307/312, Ser267/270, and Ser612/616 in rodent/human IRS-1, respectively. Our results demonstrate that all six serine kinases are activated by TNF-α and the activation is correlated to the phosphorylation of the three serine residues. To investigate the molecular events of salicylates-associated insulin sensitivity, aspirin was used to test an influence of salicylates on the IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. The results show that aspirin is able to inhibit IRS-1 serine phosphorylation through targeting multiple serine kinases including JNK, IKK, Akt, and mTOR. Cells and Reagents—Cell lines including mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 (CL-173) and human hepatoma Hep G2 (HB-8065) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). IKK1/2 double knockout and JNK knockout cell lines were used in previous studies (36Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Google Scholar, 37Chen N. She Q.B. Bode A.M. Dong Z. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1300-1304Google Scholar). All of the cells are maintained in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For 3T3-L1 cells, the glutamine concentration was 4 mm in the culture medium. Phospho-IRS-1 (Ser307) antibody (number 07-247) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Phospho-specific antibodies to Akt (Ser308), p70S6 (Thr412/Ser424), and PKCζ (Thr410/403) were obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to phospho-IRS1 at Ser270 (sc-17192) and Ser612 (sc-17195), phospho-JNK (sc-6254), phospho-ERK (sc-7383), phospho-JUN (sc-822), IRS-1 (sc-7200), and IκBα (sc-371) were made by Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). β-Actin antibody (ab6276) was from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Calyculin A (EI-192) and SP600125 (EI-305) were acquired from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). 15-Deoxyprostaglandin J2 (15dPGJ2, 538927), PD98059 (513000), and SB203580 (203580) were purchased from Cal-biochem (San Diego, CA). Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, A-5376) was from Sigma. Western Blotting—Cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 30 min after overnight serum starvation in 1% bovine serum albumin medium. Whole cell lysate protein was made in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.8, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 125 μm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) with sonication. The protein (100 μg) in 50 μl of reducing sample buffer was boiled for 3 min, and resolved in 6% mini-SDS-PAGE for 90 min at 100 volts. Then, the protein was transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (162-0184, Bio-Rad) at 21 volts for 120 min. Blotting of the membrane was conducted in milk buffer. The membrane was pre-blotted in milk buffer for 20 min, blotted with first antibody for 1–24 h and secondary antibody for 30 min. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (NA934V or NA931, Amersham Biosciences) were used with chemiluminescence reagent (NEL-105, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for generation of the light signal. To detect multiple signals from one membrane, the membrane was treated with a stripping buffer (59 mm Tri-HCl, 2% SDS, 0.75% 2-mercaptoethanol) for 20 min at 37 °C after each cycle of blotting to remove the bound antibody. All the experiments were conducted for three or more times. Intensity of the immunoblot signal is analyzed quantitatively using a computer program, PDQuest 7.1, which is made by Bio-Rad. A mean value of results from three experiments were presented. Glucose Uptake by 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 preadipocytes (5 × 105/well) were differentiated into adipocytes in a 12-well plate using a standard differentiation mixture (5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 1 μm dexamethasone) for 10 days. After serum starvation in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium overnight, the cells were pretreated with aspirin (5 mm) for 30 min, and then treated with TNF-α (20 ng/ml) for an additional 5 h before glucose uptake assay. Glucose uptake assay was conducted using a method as reported (38Kozma L. Baltensperger K. Klarlund J. Porras A. Santos E. Czech M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4460-4464Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in 1 ml/well phosphate-buffered saline containing 200 nm insulin for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm 2-deoxyglucose and 1 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[3H]glucose for 5 min. Then, the cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and solubilized in 0.4 ml of 1% SDS. [3H]Glucose uptake was detected in 4 ml of scintillant using Beckman LS6500 scintillation counter. Nonspecific deoxyglucose uptake was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B and is subtracted from the total uptake to get insulin-specific glucose uptake. Ser307 Phosphorylation of IRS-1 Is Associated with Activation of JNK and IKK—IRS-1 represents one of four IRS protein isoforms, which include IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS-4 (39White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Google Scholar, 40White M.F. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. 1996; 351: 181-189Google Scholar). Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been proposed as a general mechanism of functional inhibition of the IRS-1 protein. Among the serine residues that become phosphorylated in response to risk factors of insulin resistance, Ser307 has been studied extensively and Ser307 phosphorylation has become a molecular indicator of insulin resistance (13Aguirre V. Werner E.D. Giraud J. Lee Y.H. Shoelson S.E. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1531-1537Google Scholar, 36Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Google Scholar, 41Lee Y.H. Giraud J. Davis R.J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2896-2902Google Scholar, 42Hirosumi J. Tuncman G. Chang L. Gorgun C. Uysal K. Maeda K. Karin M. Hotamisligil G.S. Nature. 2002; 420: 333-336Google Scholar). Although it was reported that Ser307 is a phosphoacceptor of JNK and IKK (12Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar, 36Gao Z. Hwang D. Bataille F. Lefevre M. York D. Quon M. Ye J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48115-48121Google Scholar), activities of these two kinases have not been confirmed simultaneously in cells that are resistant to insulin. To address this issue, we tested Ser307 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and Hep G2 cells after TNF-α treatment. Ser307 phosphorylation was induced by TNF-α in both cell lines, and the phosphorylation was detected as early as 5 min following TNF treatment (Fig. 1A). 3- and 10-fold increases in Ser307 phosphorylation were detected at 5 min in 3T3-L1 and Hep G2 cells, respectively. A difference in the dynamics of the phosphorylation was observed in the two cell lines. In 3T3-L1 cells, Ser307 phosphorylation peaked at 5 min and then reduced in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A, 3T3-L1). In Hep G2 cells, the reduction was not observed in Ser307 phosphorylation up to 2 h (Fig. 1A, HepG2). As 3T3-L1 and Hep G2 are representatives of preadipocytes and hepatocytes, the data suggests a cell type-related difference in Ser307 phosphorylation. JNK and IKK were activated when Ser307 phosphorylation was induced by TNF treatment. However, the time course of JNK and IKK activation is different in the 3T3-L1 and Hep G2 cells. JNK activation was determined by monitoring phosphorylation of JNK (Thr183 and Tyr185) and c-Jun (Ser63), which is a substrate of JNK. In 3T3-L1 cells, JNK1 phosphorylation was detected before TNF treatment, but a 3-fold increase was induced by TNF-α at the peak time (Fig. 1B, JNK1). JNK1 phosphorylation then reduced to the basal level by 30 min. JNK2 phosphorylation was not detectable before TNF treatment, and it was induced by 13 times at the peak after TNF treatment, and then decreased immediately (Fig. 1B, JNK2). Consistent with the JNK activation, c-Jun phosphorylation (Ser63) was induced by TNF treatment in a time course comparable with the JNK activity (Fig. 1B, pJUN). In Hep G2 cells, JNK activation was also detected at 5 min, but the peak was 15 min after TNF treatment (Fig. 1C, pJNK1 and pJNK2). A peak of c-Jun phosphorylation correlated to the peak of JNK activity at 15 min (Fig. 1C, pJUN). Taken together, these results suggest that JNK activation starts and decays earlier in 3T3-L1 cells. IKK activity was monitored using IκBα protein abundance as an indicator in the study. IκBα undergoes proteasome-dependent degradation immediately after IKK activation. IκBα protein levels recover within 1 h following the degradation as a result of feedback of NF-κB activation. In both 3T3-L1 and Hep G2 cells, IκBα degradation was induced by TNF-α, however, IκBα degradation was more complete in Hep G2 cells (Fig. 1D, HepG2) than that in 3T3-L1 cells. This suggests that IKK activity is higher in Hep G2 cells. The JNK and IKK activation correlates to the induction of Ser307 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 and Hep G2 cells. Inhibition of JNK Resulted in Reduction of Ser307 Phosphorylation—To confirm the role of JNK in phosphorylation of IRS-1, Ser307 phosphorylation was investigated in two systems in which JNK activity was specifically reduced. In the embryo fibroblasts of JNK1 knockout mice, JNK1 activity was reduced by gene inactivation as indicated by a decreased c-Jun phosphorylation after TNF treatment (Fig. 2A, pJUN). In JNK1–/– cells, IKK activity remains intact as indicated by degradation of IκBα after TNF treatment. Ser307 phosphorylation was decreased by 65% in the JNK1–/– cells (Fig. 2A, pS307). SP600125 is a JNK-specific inhibitor (43Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S. Satoh Y. Bhagwat S.S. Manning A.M. Anderson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13681-13686Google Scholar). When tested together with MEK inhibitor PD98059, SP600125 exhibited a specific activity in reducing c-Jun phosphorylation, but not ERK phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). MEK inhibitor expressed a strong inhibitory activity in ERK phosphorylation, but it also reduced c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). This suggests that the MEK inhibitor exhibited certain levels of nonspecificity. The nonspecific effect of MEK inhibitor on JNK may not be strong enough to block IRS-1 Ser307 phosphorylation (Fig. 2C). Both JNK and ERK activities were not influenced by p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Fig. 2B). When applied to 3T3-L1 and Hep G2 cells, only JNK inhibitor SP600125 reduced Ser307 phosphorylation induced by TNF treatment (Fig. 2C). These results consistently support the role of JNK in Ser307/312 phosphorylation. Inhibition of IKK Reduced Ser307 Phosphorylation—To confirm the role of IKK in phosphorylation of IRS-1, a similar strategy was taken as to the study of JNK. In the embryo fibroblasts derived from IKK1 and IKK2 double knockout mice, both IKK1 and IKK2 activities are reduced by gene inactivation, but JNK activity remains intact. These are indicated by IκBα protein degradation and c-Jun phosphorylation after TNF treatment (Fig. 3A). In IKK1/2–/– cells, TNF-induced Ser307 phosphorylation was reduced by 60% as indicated by a result from the quantitative analysis (Fig. 3A). 15dPGJ2 is an established IKK inhibitor (44Rossi A. Kapahi P. Natoli G. Takahashi T. Chen Y. Karin M. Santoro M.G. Nature. 2000; 403: 103-108Google Scholar). When tested together with the JNK inhibitor, 15dPGJ2 exhibited a specific activity in the suppression of IKK activity by blocking IκBα degradation (Fig. 3B). In the same condition, JNK inhibitor failed to prevent IKK activation because IκBα reduction was not blocked by SP600125 (Fig. 2B). When the IKK inhibitor was used to treat Hep G2 cells, Ser307 phosphorylation was significantly reduced (Fig. 3C). The activity of the IKK inhibitor is comparable with that of the JNK inhibitor for inhibition of Ser307 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). A similar pattern of inhibition of IRS-1 phosphorylation was observed using 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 3C). It was noted that both IKK and JNK inhibitors were unable to completely remove Ser307 phosphorylation when used individually. When combined together, IKK and JNK inhibitors led to a 95% inhibition of Ser307 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, Comb). These results support the role of IKK and JNK in Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1. Aspirin Inhibits Ser307 Phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 Cells—It was reported that aspirin could inhibit IRS-1 serine phosphorylation (5Yuan M. Konstantopoulos N. Lee J. Hansen L. Li Z.W. Karin M. Shoelson S.E. Science. 2001; 293: 1673-1677Google Scholar), but aspirin-sensitive serine residues were not identified in the study. In a recent study, aspirin was shown to block Ser307 phosphorylation by reducing JNK activity (45Jiang G. Dallas-Yang Q. Liu F. Moller D.E. Zhang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 180-186Google Scholar), but IKK activity was not successfully evaluated in the study. In the current study, we investigated an effect of aspirin on Ser307 phosphorylation through examination of both JNK and IKK activities. In 3T3-L1 cells, aspirin (5 mm) was found to reduce Ser307 phosphorylation by 70% (Fig. 4A). This reduction was associated with a reduction in JNK activity as phosphorylation of JNK and c-Jun were both decreased by aspirin (Fig. 4B). IKK activity was also suppressed by aspirin in the same cells by checking IκBα protein abundance (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that aspirin inhibits Ser307 phosphorylation by blocking both JNK and IKK in 3T3-L1 cells. This observation is consistent with published data that aspirin is able to block both JNK and IKK activity (46Huang C. Ma W.Y. Hanenberger D. Cleary M.P. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26325-26331Google Scholar, 47Yin M.J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Google Scholar). TNF-α Activates Other Serine Kinases—TNF-α is able to induce IRS-1 serine phosphorylation by activating other serine kinases in addition to JNK and IKK. Those serine kinases include Akt (48Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Google Scholar), ERK (49Chen G. Goeddel D.V. Science. 2002; 296: 1634-1635Google Scholar), mTOR (19Haruta T. Uno T. Kawahara J. Takano A. Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 783-794Google Scholar, 33Ozes O.N. Akca H. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Donner D.B.

Fabbro D. Pfizenmaier K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1961-1969Google Scholar). In this study, we examined activation of these serine kinases in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes through their phosphorylation status by immunoblotting. The results show that all of these four serine kinases are activated by TNF-α in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt, Thr410/403 phosphorylation of PKCζ, and Tyr204 phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 were induced by TNF-α. Activation of mTOR was determined using the phosphorylation status of p70S6 (Thr412/Ser424), an immediate downstream substrate of mTOR. In terms of time course of activation, Akt, mTOR, and PKCζ exhibited a similar pattern, in which activation was detectable at 1 min and peaked at 15–30 min. Although ERK activation was also detectable at 1 min, the activation peak was observed at 5 min. At 2 h after TNF stimulation, activation of all four serine kinases went down as indicated by the phosphorylation status. These results suggest that Akt, mTOR, PKCζ, and ERK are activated at the same time in cells after TNF treatment, supporting that they may be involve in IRS-1 serine phosphorylation. It was suggested that in IRS-1, phosphorylation of Ser267/270 is related to Akt activation (31Paz K. Liu Y.F. Shorer H. Hemi R. LeRoith D. Quan M. Kanety H. Seger R. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28816-28822Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Ser612/616 is related to ERK activation (24De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12939-12947Google Scholar, 25Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1557-1569Google Scholar, 26Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 181-189Google Scholar). To test these relationships, phosphorylation of these two serine residues were determined in IRS-1 using phospho-specific IRS-1 antibodies. The result showed that phosphorylation of these two serine residues was induced by TNF-α in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5B). The time course of the phosphorylation correlates to that of Akt and ERK activation, which peaks at 5 min and then decreases with time. Aspirin Inhibits TNF-induced Akt and mTOR—To our knowledge, it is not clear whether aspirin has an effect on the activity of serine kinases like Akt, mTOR, ERK, and PKCζ. To determine the activity of aspirin on these four kinases, TNF-induced activation of these kinases was examined in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes with aspirin pretreatment. The results show that aspirin exhibits different activities on these four kinases. It suppressed activation of Akt and mTOR, but exhibited no significant effect on ERK and PKCζ (Fig. 6, A and B). Because both Akt- and mTOR-induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 were indicated in the impairment of insulin signaling (19Har"

https://openalex.org/W1976573212,"The Endeavour segment of the Juan de Fuca ridge is host to one of the most vigorous hydrothermal areas found on the global mid-ocean-ridge system, with five separate vent fields located within 15 km along the top of the ridge segment. Over the past decade, the largest of these vent fields, the 'Main Endeavour Field', has exhibited a constant spatial gradient in temperature and chloride concentration in its vent fluids, apparently driven by differences in the nature and extent of subsurface phase separation. This stable situation was disturbed on 8 June 1999 by an earthquake swarm. Owing to the nature of the seismic signals and the lack of new lava flows observed in the area during subsequent dives of the Alvin and Jason submersibles (August-September 1999), the event was interpreted to be tectonic in nature. Here we show that chemical data from hydrothermal fluid samples collected in September 1999 and June 2000 strongly suggest that the event was instead volcanic in origin. Volatile data from this event and an earlier one at 9 degrees N on the East Pacific Rise show that such magmatic events can have profound and rapid effects on fluid-mineral equilibria, phase separation, 3He/heat ratios and fluxes of volatiles from submarine hydrothermal systems."
https://openalex.org/W2148889490,"Cytosine methylation is common, but not ubiquitous, in eukaryotes. Mammals and the fungus Neurospora crassa have about 2-3% of cytosines methylated. In mammals, methylation is almost exclusively in the under-represented CpG dinucleotides, and most CpGs are methylated whereas in Neurospora, methylation is not preferentially in CpG dinucleotides and the bulk of the genome is unmethylated. DNA methylation is essential in mammals but is dispensable in Neurospora, making this simple eukaryote a favoured organism in which to study methylation. Recent studies indicate that DNA methylation in Neurospora depends on one DNA methyltransferase, DIM-2 (ref. 6), directed by a histone H3 methyltransferase, DIM-5 (ref. 7), but little is known about its cellular and evolutionary functions. As only four methylated sequences have been reported previously in N. crassa, we used methyl-binding-domain agarose chromatography to isolate the methylated component of the genome. DNA sequence analysis shows that the methylated component of the genome consists almost exclusively of relics of transposons that were subject to repeat-induced point mutation--a genome defence system that mutates duplicated sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2017767046,"The earliest stars to form in the Universe were the first sources of light, heat and metals after the Big Bang. The products of their evolution will have had a profound impact on subsequent generations of stars. Recent studies of primordial star formation have shown that, in the absence of metals (elements heavier than helium), the formation of stars with masses 100 times that of the Sun would have been strongly favoured, and that low-mass stars could not have formed before a minimum level of metal enrichment had been reached. The value of this minimum level is very uncertain, but is likely to be between 10(-6) and 10(-4) that of the Sun. Here we show that the recent discovery of the most iron-poor star known indicates the presence of dust in extremely low-metallicity gas, and that this dust is crucial for the formation of lower-mass second-generation stars that could survive until today. The dust provides a pathway for cooling the gas that leads to fragmentation of the precursor molecular cloud into smaller clumps, which become the lower-mass stars."

PQQ is acting as a mammalian redox cofactor in this reaction, and therefore qualifies as a newcomer to the B group of vitamins."

We subsequently cloned the precursor gene of the P52 ligand and characterized the activity of other possible peptides encoded by the precursor. This revealed an extended peptide, P518, which exhibited high affinity for SP9155 (EC50 = 7 nm). mRNA expression analysis revealed that the peptide P518 precursor gene is predominantly expressed in various brain regions, coronary arteries, thyroid and parathyroid glands, large intestine, colon, bladder, testes, and prostate.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). GPCRs mediate a variety of physiological functions by interacting with extracellular ligands including small chemical molecules, peptides, and proteins, then transmitting the signal to intracellular second messengers via G proteins (1Gilman A.G.

Whereas these GPCRs have common structural motifs including seven transmembrane domains, often their cognate ligands and biological function are unknown (3Howard A.D. McAllister G. Feighner S.D.

To understand the biological functions of these so called orphan receptors, and to enable identification of pharmacological agents active at these receptors, it is helpful to first identify their endogenous cognate ligands (3Howard A.D.

Currently there are two main approaches generally used to identify orphan receptor ligands. One common approach has been to screen the orphan GPCRs against a collection of known or putative GPCR ligands. This approach has been used successfully to identify several ligand receptor pairings, including MCH, NMU, and P2Y13 etc. (6Charmers J. Ames R.S. Bergsma D. Muir A. Fitzgerald L.R. Hervieu G.

However, because ligand collections are somewhat limited, they often do not contain the appropriate ligand for the orphan receptor of interest. Another approach involves purification of the ligands from animal tissue extracts. This approach has also been successful in a number of cases including OFQ/Nociceptin, MCH, Orexin, and P2Y12 etc. (9Reinscheid R.K. Nothacker H.P. Bourson A. Ardati A. Henningsen R.A. Bunzow J.R.

However, purification of ligands from animal tissue extracts is labor-intensive and is complicated by the potential for background activity, the low abundance of ligands, and stability of ligands in animal tissue extracts. In the present study we utilized an alternative approach to identifying ligands for orphan receptors. Because many orphan receptors are predicted to be peptide receptors, and peptide ligands must be encoded by DNA sequences, it should be possible using a variety of methods to predict peptide ligands from sequences stored in the human genome data bases. Peptides predicted in this manner can then be synthesized and tested for biological activity of GPCRs. In the present study, we have used a novel peptide homology algorithm (PepPat) to search the human genome for potential bio-active peptides (16Jiang Y. Gao G. Fang G. Gustafson E.L. Laverty M. Yin Y. Zhang Y. Luo J. Greene J.R. Bayne M.L. Hedrick J. Murgolo N.J. et al.Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we have successfully identified a novel ligand for an orphan receptor designated as SP9155. Reagents and Materials—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma except as otherwise noted. Fluo-3-AM and pluronic acid were from Molecular Probes. Cell culture media and reagents were from Invitrogen. All synthetic peptides were custom synthesized at Invitrogen. All cloning work was performed according to standard procedures in Ref. 24. Chimeric Gα proteins (Gαq/z, Gαq/s, Gαq/12, Gαq/i, Gαq/i3, Gαq/o, Gαq/16) were constructed by replacing the five C-terminal residues of human Gαq with the five amino acid residues of the corresponding G protein (14Conklin B.R. Farfel Z. Lustig K.D. Julius D. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), and were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDNA3. 1 (Invitrogen). Bioinformatic Identification of Novel RF-amide Peptides—RF-amide peptides share a common C-terminal RFG[KR] motif. First, a virtual transcripts protein data base (VTS) was generated from human genomic sequence using GenScan (20Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar). Using a pattern-based oligopeptide homology search algorithm (PepPat) (16Jiang Y. Gao G. Fang G. Gustafson E.L. Laverty M. Yin Y. Zhang Y. Luo J. Greene J.R. Bayne M.L. Hedrick J. Murgolo N.J. et al.Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we searched the VTS protein data base for proteins or exons containing this RFG[KR] motif. Proteins or exons that contain RFG[KR] motifs were further analyzed for the presence of a leader peptide or transmembrane domains (16Jiang Y. Gao G. Fang G. Gustafson E.L. Laverty M. Yin Y. Zhang Y. Luo J. Greene J.R. Bayne M.L. Hedrick J. Murgolo N.J. et al.Mamm. Genome. 2003; 14: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Those genes containing at least one RFG[KR] motif, with a predicted leader sequence but without predicted TM domain, were regarded as putative RF-amide precursors. These predicted peptides were then synthesized and put into our in-house peptide collection for screening. Cloning and Expression of Human and Mouse SP9155—A full-length cDNA of SP9155 (referred to as AQ27) was originally isolated from a human brain cDNA library and was disclosed in patent WO2001016316. Based on the AQ27 sequence two primers were designed and the full-length PCR product was obtained from human brain cDNA library. This clone was designated as SP9155. The open reading frame of SP9155 was then subcloned into the expression vector pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and used for cell transfection experiments. To identify the mouse homologue of SP9155, the protein sequence of human SP9155 was used to search GenBank™ with BLAST, and two mouse EST sequences (BI729969 and BB084541) were identified that were highly homologous to the 5′ and 3′ ends of human SP9155. Primers were designed based on the two EST sequences to clone the full-length of mouse SP9155; the 5′-primer was: 5′-CACCATGCAGGCGCTCAACATCACCGCGGA-3′, and the 3′-primer was: 5′-GGCTTACAGTTCATGTCCACTGCCGAAAGT-3′. PCR reactions were performed using Marathon mouse brain cDNA (Clontech), and the resulting PCR product was then cloned into TOPO-pCDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequence confirmed. Cloning of Human and Mouse Peptide P518 Precursor—Primers for the human were designed based on the human genomic sequence for the peptide coding VTS; the 5′-primer was: 5′-GCCGAATTCGCCGCCACCATGGTAAGGCCTTACCCCCTGATCTACTTC-3′, and the 3′-primer was: 5′-GCCTCACCGCCGACCGAAGCGGAAGCTGAAGCC-3′. The PCR reaction was performed using the human Quick-clone kidney cDNA (Clontech) with the Advantage HF 2 kit. The cycling conditions were 1 cycle at 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR product was first cloned into PCR blunt vector (Invitrogen), then subcloned to pCDNA3.1(–) (Invitrogen) vector and the sequence was confirmed. Primers for mouse were designed based on the suggested mouse precursor sequence, the 5′-primer was: 5′-GCCGAATTCGCCGCCACCATGAGGGGCTTCCGGCCTTTGCTTTCCCTA-3′; and the 3′-primer was: 5′-GCCAAGCTTTCACCGTCCAAAGCGGAAGCTGAAGCCTCC-3′. The PCR reaction was performed using human Quick-clone spleen cDNA (Clontech) with the Advantage HF 2 kit. The cycling conditions were 1 cycle at 94 °C for 1 min, 35 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s, 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR product was cloned into TOPO-pCDNA3.1 vector and sequence confirmed. Cell Transfection and Assay—For ligand screening assays, 5 μg of SP9155/pCDNA3.1 was transfected into HEK293SFM (Invitrogen) or CHO-DHFR– cells in a 75-cm2 flask by LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). As a negative control, the same amount of empty pCDNA3.1 plasmid was transfected into HEK293SFM or CHO cells. FLIPR assays were performed 48 h later as previously described. Human and Mouse Tissue Panels—Human tissue autopsy samples were purchased from Zoion Diagnostics (Shrewsbury, MA). Postmortem times for tissue collection ranged from 2 to 6 h. Total RNA was isolated from the tissues using TRI Reagent (MRC, Cincinnati, OH), and tested for quality and quantity using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Waldbroun, Germany). Tissues from three donors were used in the analysis, and included 19 brain regions and 36 peripheral tissues. Mouse tissues were prepared from three C57/Bl6 mice. The RNAs were extracted and analyzed in the same manner as for the human tissues and included 12 brain regions and 23 peripheral tissues. Quantitative PCR—Taqman primers and probes were designed with Primer Express software (ABI), and purchased from ABI. The fluorogenic probes were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein as the reporter and 6-carboxy-4,7,2,7′-tetramethylrhodamine as a quencher. The sequences of the human and mouse primers and probes for SP9155 and P518 precursor are shown in Table I, with the numbers corresponding to the open reading frames for each. For the human tissues, quantitative PCR was carried out with an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR reactions were prepared using the components from the Invitrogen Platinum quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR one-step kit and assembled according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The final concentrations of the primers and probe in the PCR reactions were 200 and 100 nm, respectively. In addition, 0.25 μl of a passive reference dye (ROX, Invitrogen) was added to each reaction, and each 12.5-μl PCR contained 2.5 μl (25 ng) of total RNA prepared as described above. The reverse transcriptase-PCR reactions for both SP9155 and P518 precursor were performed in a single 384-well plate according to the following protocol: 1 cycle for 30 min at 48 °C, followed by one 20-min cycle at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Separate plates of the same RNAs were used to quantitate 18 S RNA as an internal control for RNA quality, and a primer/probe set for the CD4 promoter was used to check the RNAs for genomic contamination.Table IPrimer and probe sequences used in the quantitative PCR reactionsHumanMouseSP9155Forward primer777AGAAATGTCCAAAATAGCCAGGAAG215TCTTTGGCAACTCTCTGGTCATCReverse primer877GGACAACATGGAATGGTGCC329CAGAAGAAGGCAATGAGCAGATCProbe813TGTCATTATGATGGTGACAGTGGTGGCTCTC263TGCGCACCGTCACCAACATCTTCP518Forward primer8GGCCTTACCCCCTGATCTACTT374TCTCCCTCTGAGTGCCTGCTReverse primer74CTTCTGTCCAGTAGAGGGAAGCA510GCCTGTGCTGTGGATTTTGAProbe32TCTTCCTGCCGCTGGGCGC421CAGACATCGGTGACATCGGAGCCA Open table in a new tab For the mouse tissues, the RNA from three mice/tissue was pooled and cDNAs were generated by reverse transcription using random hexamers (Promega, Madison, WI) and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogene). For TaqMan analysis, 25 ng of tissue cDNA was used together with primers at 900 nm final concentration, and the 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled probe at a final concentration of 250 nm. Each cDNA was run in duplicate, and ribosomal RNA primers/probe (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used as an internal control. Quantitative PCR conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min; 95 °C for 10 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 1 min. Data Analysis—The PCR data was quantitated based on standard curves generated using serial dilutions of either plasmid DNA or a gene-specific PCR product. For the human PCR, 4-fold dilutions began at 0.25 ng, and eight dilutions were used to generate the standard curve. The human SP9155 standard curve was generated using plasmid dilutions, whereas the P518 data was generated using dilutions of a 350-bp PCR product. The mouse standard curves were generated using plasmids containing the mouse SP9155 and P518 precursor genes, with the dilution ranging from 1 ng to 1 fg. To compare the results obtained using plasmids versus PCR products as standards, all data were averaged and converted to copy number/25 ng of cDNA, thus accounting for the differences in weight between the two. Cloning and Sequence Analysis—A full-length human cDNA of SP9155 was first identified from Patent WO2001016316. It contained a 1296-base open reading frame encoding 431 amino acid residues (see Fig. 1A), and was similar to a recently reported orphan GPCR receptor GPR103 (15Lee D.K. Nguyen T. Lynch K.R. Cheng R. Vanti W.B. Arkhitko O. Lewis T. Evans J.F. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, GPR103 contained about 190 bp of additional sequence in the N terminus and about 100 bp of additional sequence in the middle of the gene when compared with SP9155. Further analysis of these sequences indicated that they were mitochondrial and intronic sequences. Disregarding these extraneous sequences in GPR103 revealed that GPR103 was the same as SP9155 (15Lee D.K. Nguyen T. Lynch K.R. Cheng R. Vanti W.B. Arkhitko O. Lewis T. Evans J.F. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 275: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Analysis of the hydrophilicity profile of the deduced peptide sequence revealed the presence of seven hydrophobic regions (underlined in Fig. 1A), consistent with a seven-transmembrane structure typical of G protein-coupled receptors (2Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Using the human SP9155 protein sequence to search GenBank™, murine EST sequences with 87% protein sequence identity to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the human open reading frame were identified (see “Experimental Procedures”). The full-length mouse SP9155 (mSP9155) was cloned using the primers based on these 5′ and 3′ EST sequences. The sequence alignment for human and mouse SP9155 is shown in Fig. 1A. Phylogenetic analysis shows that SP9155 shares homology with NPFF, Orexin, and cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors (Fig. 1B). Its closest known receptors are NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptors (49% identical). Identification of a Novel RF-amide Peptide as a Ligand for SP9155—RF-amides are a well known family of GPCR peptide ligands in which the C terminus is arginine-phenylalanineamide (17Hinuma S. Shintani Y. Fukusumi S. Iijima N. Matsumoto Y. Hosoya M. Fujii R. Watanabe T. Kikuchi K. Terao Y. Yano T. Yamamoto T. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Asada M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Nishimura O. Tanaka M. Ibata Y. Fujino M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Recently, novel RF-amide peptides such as hRFP-1, hRFP-2, and KiSS have been identified as ligands for orphan GPCRs (17Hinuma S. Shintani Y. Fukusumi S. Iijima N. Matsumoto Y. Hosoya M. Fujii R. Watanabe T. Kikuchi K. Terao Y. Yano T. Yamamoto T. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Asada M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Nishimura O. Tanaka M. Ibata Y. Fujino M. Nat.

To search for novel RF-amide peptides, we used a novel computational approach to search the human genome sequence data base. First, a VTS data base was generated from human genomic sequence using GenScan (20Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2983) Google Scholar). Using a novel proprietary pattern-based oligopeptide homology search algorithm (PepPat), the protein VTS data base was searched for genes or exons containing RFG[KR] as a motif, where G[KR] is the peptidase digestion and amidation signal. VTS sequences containing at least one RFG[KR] motif were further analyzed for the presence of a signal peptide and for transmembrane domains. The VTS sequences containing a signal peptide and no transmembrane domain were used to predict a variety of peptides for synthesis and inclusion in our in-house peptide ligand collection for screening against different orphan GPCRs. These orphan GPCRs were transiently transfected into HEK293SFM cells, and screened by FLIPR assay, which measures intracellular calcium mobilization. As a result of the screening, a peptide called P52 was found to specifically activate the orphan GPCR SP9155-transfected HEK293SFM cells (Fig. 3A). The same specificity of P52 was also observed in SP9155-transfected CHO cells (data not shown). However, the EC50 of P52 in both cell lines was only about 250 nm (Tables II and III). Examination of the genomic sequence corresponding to P52 revealed the presence of an uninterrupted open reading frame of 381 bp nucleotides, yielding a 126-residue predicted protein (designated as P518 precursor protein) (Fig. 2). The mouse homolog of the precursor was identified by BLAST search of the GenBank™ data base. Both human and mouse precursor genes were cloned from cDNA libraries by using the primers designed based on the predicted precursor genes. Analysis of the predicted protein by the PSORT and SignalP programs indicated that the first 22 amino acid residues could serve as a signal peptide, and that no potential transmembrane domains were present, suggesting that the predicted human protein (or cleavage products) could be secreted.Table IIPredicted peptides from peptide precursorA.

These longer versions of P52 including P513, P517, and P518 were then tested for activity at SP9155 (Tables II and III). As shown in Table III and Fig. 3, the activities for P52, P513, and P517 were similar, with EC50 values for SP9155 around 250 nm. However, peptide P518 was found to more potently activate SP9155 with an EC50 of 7 nm, whereas no activity was detected in the vector-transfected HEK293SFM cells (Fig. 3C). The high potency of P518 suggests that this could be an endogenous ligand for SP9155. The mouse homolog of the P518 peptide (designated as P550) has similar activity for SP9155 as the P518 peptide, and its EC50 is about 6 nm. N-terminal extended peptides from the other RFGR motif of P518 preproprotein (P51, P242, and P552) were also tested for agonist activity for the SP9155 (Fig. 3B). The activities of P51 and P242 for SP9155 are very weak, with EC50 values greater than 1 μm. However, the activity of P552 is comparable with those of P52, P513, and P517 with an EC50 of 600 nm. The activation of SP9155 by P518 in the absence of added G proteins, suggests that SP9155 probably couples to Gq. To further determine the effect of G-protein coupling on SP9155, different single chimeric G-proteins including Gαq/12, Gαq/16, Gαq/i, Gαq/z, Gαq/i3, Gαq/s, Gα16, and Gαq/o were co-transfected with SP9155 into HEK293SFM cells, and the potency to P518 was then measured by FLIPR (12Zhang F.L. Luo L. Gustafson E. Lachowicz J. Smith M. Qiao X. Liu Y.-H. Chen G. Pramanik B. Laz T.Z. Palmer K. Bayne M. Monsma Jr., F.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 1993; 363: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). It was found that with or without chimeric G proteins the potency of P518 for SP9155 is similar (data not shown). Moreover, the ability of P518 to mobilize intracellular Ca2+ via SP9155 was not affected by pertussis toxin treatment (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that SP9155 is coupled to the Gαq signaling pathway. Expression Profile of P518 Precursor mRNA and SP9155 in Human and Mouse Tissues—The standard curves generated from the plasmids and PCR products indicated that all the Taqman primer and probe sets behaved in the expected manner, with approximately equivalent efficiencies (data not shown). In addition, the 18 S and CD4 control probe sets demonstrated that the RNAs were of good quality and without genomic contamination. In the human tissue RNA panel (Fig. 4A), both the SP9155 receptor and the P518 precursor mRNAs exhibited the highest expression in brain. In most brain regions, there was coordinate expression of receptor and ligand mRNAs, however, in peripheral tissues the receptor was nonexistent or expressed at low levels. In brain, the receptor was most abundant in retina, trigeminal ganglion, hypothalamus, and vestibular nucleus, whereas the peptide mRNA was most abundant in cerebellum, medulla, retina, and vestibular nucleus. In peripheral tissues, significant expression of the SP9155 receptor was found only in heart, kidney, and testes RNAs. The P518 precursor mRNA was found in prostate, testes, colon, thyroid, parathyroid, coronary artery, and bladder. In murine tissues, SP9155 mRNA was highly expressed in brain, particularly in hypothalamus, cortex, and spinal cord (Fig. 4B). In contrast to human brain, the murine version of the P518 precursor was expressed at low levels relative to the receptor. In mouse peripheral tissues, both SP9155 and P518 precursor were found in low abundance, although as in human peripheral tissues the P518 precursor mRNA was expressed at higher levels than the receptor. In the present study, we have used a bioinformatics approach to identify novel RF-amide peptide precursor genes from human and mouse genomic data bases. One of these genes has been shown to encode several potential peptides, one of which potently activates an orphan GPCR. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the gene for this peptide precursor protein is expressed as mRNA in various human and mouse tissues. The peptides (P52, P513, P517, P518, and P552) have been shown to be agonists for the orphan G-protein-coupled receptor SP9155, and in particular, peptide P518 has been shown to activate SP9155 with an EC50 of 7 nm. Peptides P52, P513, P517, and P518 have a common C-terminal sequence, but they differ in the length of N-terminal sequence. The EC50 values for peptides P52, P513, and P517 are similar and are around 250 nm, indicating that the N-terminal lysine in P513 and P517 does not have much effect on the potency of peptides. However, the EC50 for P518 is about 7 nm, which is about 35-fold more potent than P52, P513, and P517, indicating that the N-terminal part of P518 also interacts with SP9155 receptor. Many RF-amide peptides have been previously identified in lower organisms: in Caenorhabditis elegans, more than 50 distinct RF-amide peptides have been found (21Nelson L.S. Rosoff M.L. Li C. Science. 1998; 281: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Li C. Kim K. Nelson L.S. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In such lower organisms these peptides exhibit diverse functions including cardioexitation, control of muscle contraction, and neuromodulation (21Nelson L.S. Rosoff M.L. Li C. Science. 1998; 281: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 22Li C. Kim K. Nelson L.S. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 26-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). However, in mammals, only a few RF-amide peptides have been reported so far. These include neuropeptide FF (NPFF), neuropeptide AF (NPAF), RFRP (RF-amide-related peptide), all of which have been shown to interact with one or more specific GPCRs (17Hinuma S. Shintani Y. Fukusumi S. Iijima N. Matsumoto Y. Hosoya M. Fujii R. Watanabe T. Kikuchi K. Terao Y. Yano T. Yamamoto T. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Asada M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Nishimura O. Tanaka M. Ibata Y.

Multiple ligands have been identified for NPFF receptors. In addition to NPFF and NPAF peptides, two RFRP peptides have also been shown to act as ligands for NPFF receptors (17Hinuma S. Shintani Y. Fukusumi S. Iijima N. Matsumoto Y. Hosoya M. Fujii R. Watanabe T. Kikuchi K. Terao Y. Yano T. Yamamoto T. Kawamata Y. Habata Y. Asada M. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Nishimura O. Tanaka M. Ibata Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25965-25971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The RFRP peptides are peptides predicted from a precursor identified through a bioinformatics approach, in a similar manner used to predict the RF-amide peptide P518. A recent survey of GPCR sequences suggested that NPAF and/or NPFF are agonist ligands for SP9155 (23Joost P. Methner A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 63.1-63.1.6Crossref Google Scholar). We found that NPAF, NPFF, and other known peptide ligand GPCR agonists were not functional agonists for SP9155 (data not shown). Additionally, P518 possessed no appreciable agonist activity for other peptide ligand GPCRs, including NPFF and mestastin. Previously, Met-Enkephalin-Arg-Phe-amide was shown to activate SP9155, but its EC50 is greater than 40 μm, and Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe-amide has not been shown to be an endogenous peptide (patent WO2001016316). In the present study, the high potency of P518 for SP9155 suggests that P518 may be the endogenous ligand for SP9155. There are several lines of evidence to support this possibility. First, the precursor for P518 is derived from genomic sequence, and its physical clones have been obtained from cDNA libraries. Moreover, P518 precursor was shown to be expressed in human tissues under normal physiological conditions. Second, because SP9155 shares high homology to NPFF receptors, and the ligands for NPFF receptors are RF-amide peptides, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the ligand for SP9155 is likely to be an RF-amide peptide. Third, P518 peptide is a potent ligand for SP9155 at low nanomolar and the potency is in the range as expected for an endogenous ligand. Although P518 is most likely the endogenous ligand for SP9155, the current study does not exclude the possibility that there exist additional endogenous peptides similar to or distinctly different from the structure of P518. Confirmation of P518 as the sole or one of the multiple endogenous ligands await studies using natural tissue sources for ligand isolation. Although a potent ligand for SP9155 has been identified, the biological functions for both the ligand and SP9155 are still not clear. Further studies utilizing animal models such as knockout mice with deficient P518 or SP9155 will be useful in dissecting the functions of the peptide and receptor. Nevertheless, identification of the ligand will provide a research tool to study the functions of SP9155 and allow new agonists and antagonists to be identified by setting up screening assays for SP9155."

The progenitor of the black hole had an initial mass greater than 40 solar masses, and during the collapse to form the approximately 10-solar mass black hole of Cygnus X-1, the upper limit for the mass that could have been suddenly ejected is approximately 1 solar mass, much less than the mass ejected in a supernova.

In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that activation of P2Y2 receptors by extracellular nucleotides modulates the expression of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells that are important for monocyte recruitment. Results indicated that the equipotent P2Y2 receptor agonists UTP or ATP (1–100 μm) stimulated the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. P2Y2 antisense oligonucleotides inhibited VCAM-1 expression induced by UTP but not by tumor necrosis factor-α. Furthermore, UTP induced VCAM-1 expression in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cell transfectants expressing the recombinant P2Y2 receptor, whereas vector-transfected control cells did not respond to UTP. The effect of UTP on VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC was prevented by depletion of intracellular calcium stores with thapsigargin or by inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase or Rho kinase, but was not affected by inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (i.e. MEK1/2). Consistent with a role for VCAM-1 in the recruitment of monocytes, UTP or ATP increased the adherence of monocytic U937 cells to HCAEC, an effect that was inhibited by anti-VCAM-1 antibodies. These findings suggest a novel role for the P2Y2 receptor in the p38- and Rho kinase-dependent expression of VCAM-1 that mediates the recruitment of monocytes by vascular endothelium associated with the development of atherosclerosis.

Extracellular nucleotides cause a wide range of cellular responses and appear to play a role in the regulation of many vascular functions (1Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Google Scholar, 2Erlinge D. Gen. Pharmacol. 1998; 31: 1-8Google Scholar). Vascular cells release nucleotides when exposed to stimuli such as ischemia, hypoxia, and chemical or mechanical stress (3Grierson J.P. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4451-4456Google Scholar, 4Pearson J.D. Gordon J.L. Nature. 1979; 281: 384-386Google Scholar). It also is becoming apparent that extracellular nucleotides can promote the development of a variety of pathologies including disorders of the immune system, and neurodegenerative and vascular diseases (1Dubyak G.R. El-Moatassim C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C577-C606Google Scholar). Indeed, ATP or UTP induces proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, two processes involved in the development of intimal lesions found in atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis. The biological effects of extracellular nucleotides are mediated through activation of P1 and P2 purinergic receptors. P1 receptors are responsive to adenosine, whereas P2 receptors are activated by a variety of nucleotides including ATP and UTP (5Di Virgilio F. Chiozzi P. Ferrari D. Falzoni S. Sanz J.M. Morelli A.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 3-42Google Scholar). The P2 receptors are subdivided into two distinct categories, the metabotropic G-protein-coupled (P2Y) receptors and the ionotropic ligandgated channel (P2X) receptors (6Burnstock G. Turner J.T.

It has been reported that P2Y2 receptors are up-regulated in cells of rat intimal lesions following balloon angioplasty (9Seye C.I. Gadeau A.P. Daret D. Dupuch F. Alzieu P. Capron L. Desgranges C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3602-3610Google Scholar). Our recent studies showed that placement of a silicone collar around the rabbit carotid artery promoted up-regulation of P2Y2 receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelium (10Seye C.I. Kong Q. Erb L. Garrad R. Wang M. Turner J. Sturek M. Gonzalez F.A. Weisman G.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2720-2726Google Scholar). Subsequently, local infusion of UTP was shown to stimulate intimal hyperplasia and increase intimal monocyte infiltration (10Seye C.I. Kong Q. Erb L. Garrad R. Wang M. Turner J. Sturek M. Gonzalez F.A. Weisman G.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2720-2726Google Scholar), suggesting a role for P2Y2 receptors in the recruitment of blood monocytes leading to inflammation in atherosclerosis. Monocyte recruitment into the vessel wall is a complex process that includes cell rolling, firm attachment, and directed migration. It is now becoming evident that adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 play an important role in leukocyte adherence to vascular endothelial cells (11Faruqi R.M. DiCorleto P.E. Br.

VCAM-1 expression is induced or up-regulated by proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; HCAEC, human coronary artery endothelial cells; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; EBM-2, endothelial cell basal medium-2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propy]-N,N,N,-trimethylammonium salt; 2-MeS-ATP, 2-methyl-thio-ATP. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; HCAEC, human coronary artery endothelial cells; VCAM-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; EBM-2, endothelial cell basal medium-2; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; [Ca2+]i, intracellular Ca2+; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid; DOTAP, N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propy]-N,N,N,-trimethylammonium salt; 2-MeS-ATP, 2-methyl-thio-ATP. and interleukin 1-β on cellular components of the arterial wall including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts (13Rice G.E.

Baumann G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2571-2579Google Scholar). ATP and UTP have been shown to induce cell-cell adhesion in a monocyte/macrophage lineage and neutrophil adherence to an endothelial cell monolayer (16Ventura M.A. Thomopoulus P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 104-107Google Scholar, 17Parker A.L. Likar L.L. Dawicki D.D. Rounds S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L695-L703Google Scholar), raising the possibility that released ATP and UTP could induce endothelial cell activation by an autocrine/paracrine mechanism to regulate leukocyte adherence. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that extracellular nucleotides stimulate the expression of adhesion molecules on vascular endothelial cells and promote monocyte adherence. Results showed that the P2Y2 receptor agonists UTP or ATP induced the expression of VCAM-1 in human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). The ability of P2Y2 antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression strongly suggests that this response is mediated via P2Y2 receptors. The effects of UTP were dependent upon release of calcium from intracellular stores and activation of the p38 kinase pathway. Finally, results indicated that nucleotide-induced VCAM-1 expression increased monocyte binding to endothelial cells, supporting the hypothesis that nucleotides released during vascular injury contribute to leukocyte/endothelial cell interactions and promote inflammatory responses involved in the development of atherosclerosis. Materials—HCAEC and endothelial cell basal medium-2 (EBM-2) were purchased from Clonetics (Walkerville, MD). U937 cells were obtained from American Type Cell Collection (ATCC), and RPMI 1640 medium was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-VCAM-1 (P3C4), anti-ICAM-1 (P2A4), and anti-E-selectin (P2H3) antibodies used in blocking studies were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-ICAM-1 (clone G-5), anti-β-actin (rabbit polyclonal), anti-VCAM-1 (c-19), and anti-VCAM-1 (HAE-2z) antibodies used for Western analysis and immunofluorescence, respectively, were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Oregon green-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and Hoechst 33258 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody was obtained from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The p38 inhibitor SB203580, MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126, and Rho kinase 1/2 inhibitor Y27632 were purchased from Calbiochem (Indianapolis, IN). DOTAP liposomal reagent was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides to human P2Y2 were synthesized and purified by Integrated DNA Technologies. All other reagents including nucleotides and the PKH2 green fluorescent cell linker were obtained from Sigma, unless otherwise specified. Cell Cultures—HCAEC were cultured in EBM-2 supplemented with vascular endothelial growth factor, human fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, insulin-like growth factor, GA 1000, and 5% bovine fetal serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HCAEC were used between the third and tenth passages. Monocytic U937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The retroviral vector pLXSN was used for stable expression of the human P2Y2 receptor in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, as described previously (18Erb L. Garrad R.C. Wang T. Quinn T. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4185-4188Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant P2Y2-pLXSN construct or pLXSN (control) was used to transfect PA317 amphotropic packaging cells for production of the viral vectors. Then, 1321N1 cells were infected with the viral vectors and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for neomycin resistance selection. P2Y2Antisense S-oligonucleotides—Sequences including translation initiation site were as follows: sense, 5′-GGCGATGGCAGCAGACCTGGCCCCTGGA-3′; antisense, 5′-TCCAGGGGCCAGGTCTGCTGCCATCGCC-3′. The sequences were checked for uniqueness using the National Center for Biotechnology Information's Local Alignment Search tool (BLAST). 2Available at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. Briefly, HCAEC were incubated with 2 μm P2Y2 sense or antisense S-oligonucleotides for6hat37 °C in EBM-2 medium containing 1.4% (v/v) DOTAP liposomal reagent. Then, fresh EBM-2 medium was added and cells were cultured for an additional 20 h, as previously reported (19Warny M. Aboudola S. Robson S.C. Sevigny J. Communi D. Soltoff S.P. Kelly C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26051-26056Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothionate-conjugated P2Y2 antisense oligonucleotides were used to monitor cellular oligonucleotide uptake by HCAEC. Immunofluorescence Staining—HCAEC were made quiescent by incubation in EBM-2 for 24 h at 37 °C before exposure to UTP. After treatment with UTP (100 μm) or TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 8 h at 37 °C, the cells were fixed in acetone for 15 min and treated with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), VCAM-1 expression was detected in cells by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal anti-VCAM-1 (HAE-2z) antibody (1:200 dilution in PBS containing 5% (v/v) normal goat serum), followed by Oregon green-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution in PBS). Then, the cells were incubated in PBS containing 2 μm Hoechst 33258 for nuclear counterstaining. Binding of U937 Cells to Human Endothelial Cells—HCAEC were grown to confluence in 24-well plates in EBM-2 supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and then the cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in EBM-2 followed by stimulation with 100 μm ADP, ATP, UTP, adenosine, or 2MeS-ATP for an additional 8 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, HCAEC were preincubated with BAPTA/AM (10 μm) for 30 min before the addition of nucleotides. U937 cells were labeled with the green fluorescent dye PKH2, as described previously (20Allen S. Khan S. Al-Mohanna F. Batten P. Yacoub M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1064-1075Google Scholar). Labeled U937 cells (106 cells/well) were added to confluent cultures of HCAEC for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed several times in PBS, and adherent U937 cell numbers were determined by microscopy using fluorescein isothiocyanate illumination. In experiments designed to investigate the effect of blocking antibodies on binding of U937 cells, HCAEC were treated with UTP for 8 h at 37 °C and then 10 μg/ml anti-VCAM-1, anti-ICAM-1, or anti-E-selectin antibody was added to HCAEC for 45 min before addition of U937 cells. For each condition, cell numbers were determined in seven different fields of view in three wells. Western Blot Analysis—Equivalent amounts of protein (100 μg) in extracts of HCAEC were subjected to 7.5% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting. Detection of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was performed using goat anti-mouse VCAM-1 or goat anti-mouse ICAM-1 monoclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000 dilution). For signal normalization, membranes were probed with polyclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:2000 dilution). A mouse monoclonal pERK (E-4) antibody and a rabbit polyclonal anti-p38 MAP kinase antibody were used to analyze ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation. Statistical Analysis—Results are represented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed by analysis of variance and unpaired Student's t test (significance, p < 0.05). ATP and UTP Induce VCAM-1 Expression in Vascular Endothelial Cells—Incubation of serum-starved HCAEC with UTP or ATP for 8 h caused a dose-dependent increase in the expression of VCAM-1 (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, UDP, ADP, 2MeS-ATP, or adenosine had no significant effect even at concentrations as high as 100 μm (not shown). VCAM-1 expression was induced within 2 h of UTP or ATP addition, reached a maximum level within 6 h, and remained elevated through 16 h (Fig. 1, C and D). A significant increase in VCAM-1 expression occurred even when HCAEC were exposed to 100 μm UTP for as little as 30–60 min before the nucleotide agonist was removed (Fig. 1E). Incubation of HCAEC with the enzyme potato apyrase grade III (2 units/ml) that degrades nucleoside di- and triphosphates inhibited UTP or ATP-induced VCAM-1 expression (not shown). In contrast to VCAM-1 expression, ATP or UTP did not significantly increase ICAM-1 expression in quiescent HCAEC (Fig. 2). These data suggest a selective effect of UTP and ATP on VCAM-1 expression in human endothelial cells. Immunofluorescence staining of quiescent untreated HCAEC detected a low basal level of VCAM-1 expression with a punctate staining (Fig. 3, panel A). In cells treated with UTP (100 μm), there was diffuse VCAM-1 staining over the entire cell surface (Fig. 3, panel B). A similar VCAM-1 staining pattern was observed when cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α (Fig. 3, panel C).Fig. 2ICAM-1 expression in HCAEC is unaffected by UTP or ATP. Quiescent endothelial cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of UTP or ATP for8hat37 °C, and then ICAM-1 protein levels were determined by Western analysis with anti-ICAM-1 antibody, as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Results shown are representative of five independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Detection of VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells by immunofluorescence. Cultured HCAEC were serum-starved for 24 h at 37 °C and then incubated in the absence (panel A) or presence (panel B) of 100 μm UTP for 8 h at 37 °C. As a positive control (panel C), HCAEC were stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 8 h at 37 °C and analyzed for VCAM-1 expression. VCAM-1 staining (green) was obtained by indirect immunofluorescence, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst (blue), and the images were merged. Fluorescence micrographs representative of three individual experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Calcium Release from Internal Stores Is Required For UTP-induced VCAM-1 Expression—UTP caused an increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i, in HCAEC, a response that was inhibited by the intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM (not shown). VCAM-1 expression induced by UTP also was inhibited in HCEAC that were preincubated with 10 μm BAPTA/AM for 30 min at 37 °C (Fig. 4). Furthermore, thapsigargin (2 μg/ml), an agent that depletes intracellular calcium stores, also inhibited UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 4), further demonstrating a role for UTP-induced increases in [Ca2+]i in the expression of VCAM-1. Thapsigargin treatment had no apparent toxic effect on HCEAC as measured by trypan blue exclusion (not shown). UTP-induced VCAM-1 Expression Is Mediated by P2Y2Receptors—Pertussis toxin (100 ng/ml), an inhibitor of Gαi/o proteins, attenuated the effects of UTP on VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC (Fig. 5A). Because the P2Y2 receptor subtype has been shown to be partially sensitive to pertussis toxin (21Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrard R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Google Scholar), we evaluated the effect on UTP-stimulated VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC for inhibition of P2Y2 receptor activity with P2Y2 antisense S-oligonucleotides. Treatment of HCAEC with P2Y2 antisense S-oligonucleotides (2 μm), complementary to the P2Y2 translation initiation region, inhibited UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression by ∼50% (Fig. 5, B and C; p < 0.05) compared with cells treated with P2Y2 sense oligonucleotides. In contrast, P2Y2 antisense S-oligonucleotides had no effect on TNF-α-induced VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC (Fig. 5, B and C). To confirm the involvement of P2Y2 receptors in UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC, we stably expressed P2Y2 receptor cDNA in 1321N1 cells that lack endogenous P2 receptors (22Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Google Scholar). Cells transfected with P2Y2 receptor cDNA and treated with UTP for 8 h at 37 °C expressed VCAM-1, whereas vector-transfected control cells failed to respond to UTP (Fig. 6). Taken together, these results demonstrate that P2Y2 receptors mediate UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression.Fig. 6P2Y2 receptors mediate VCAM-1 expression in transfected 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. Human 1321N1 cells expressing the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2-1321N1 cells) or vector transfected controls (1321N1 cells) were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C with 100 μm UTP and VCAM-1 expression was determined by Western analysis, as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Rho Kinase Activation and p38 Phosphorylation Mediate UTP-induced VCAM-1 Expression—The UTP-induced increase in [Ca2+]i mediates mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in vascular cell types including endothelial cells (23Chaulet H.

Sci. 1998; 19: 99-107Google Scholar). In HCAEC, UTP (100 μm) caused the rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 that was inhibited by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (5 μm) or the p38 inhibitor SB203580 (10 μm), respectively (Fig. 7A). Preincubation of HCAEC with 10 μm SB203530 prevented UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC, whereas the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (5 μm) had no effect (Fig. 7B). Because P2Y receptors have been shown to couple to activation of the small GTPase RhoA (25Sauzeau V. Le Jeune H. Cario-Toumaniantz C. Vaillant N. Gadeau A.P. Desgranges C. Scalbert E. Chardin P. Pacaud P. Loirand G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1751-H1761Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 on UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression. Pretreatment of HCAEC with 10 μm Y27632 inhibited the expression of VCAM-1 induced by UTP (Fig. 7B). Thus, phosphorylation of Rho kinase and p38, but not ERK1/2, is involved in the intracellular signaling pathways leading to VCAM-1 expression induced by UTP. VCAM-1 Expression Correlates with Increased Monocytic Cell Adherence to Endothelial Cells—Stimulation of HCAEC with UTP or ATP (100 μm) for 8 h increased the binding of U937 monocytes to HCAEC by ∼4- and ∼3.6-fold, respectively, compared with HCAEC incubated in the absence of nucleotides (Fig. 8). In contrast, treatment of HCAEC with UDP, adenosine, or 2MeS-ATP (Fig. 8) or ADP (not shown) did not significantly increase U937 cell adherence to HCAEC. Introduction of BAPTA/AM (10 μm) into HCAEC prior to treatment with UTP attenuated U937 cell binding to endothelial cells (Fig. 8). Incubation of HCAEC with anti-VCAM-1 antibody, but not anti-ICAM-1 or anti-E-selectin antibody, significantly decreased U937 cell binding to UTP-treated HCAEC (Fig. 8). These antibodies did not affect U937 cell adherence to HCAEC in the absence of UTP (not shown). The present study demonstrates that exogenous UTP or ATP stimulate VCAM-1 expression via P2Y2 receptors in HCAEC. It also indicates that the P2Y2 receptor-mediated increase in VCAM-1 expression promotes the adherence of U937 monocytes to HCAEC. These results, for the first time, link P2Y purinergic receptor signaling to the mechanisms controlling the expression of an endothelial cell adhesion molecule involved in monocyte recruitment in early atherosclerosis. Vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis are initiated by vascular injury. Previous reports demonstrated that large amounts of nucleotides are released into the extracellular milieu in response to vascular stress conditions including ischemia/oxidative stress, flow, and mechanical stretch (3Grierson J.P. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4451-4456Google Scholar, 4Pearson J.D. Gordon J.L. Nature. 1979; 281: 384-386Google Scholar). In addition, high concentrations of extracellular ATP and UTP generated in vivo by platelet aggregation or cell damage that occurs during transluminal angioplasty should increase the concentration of nucleotides in the vessel wall. Although the metabolism of extracellular nucleotides by ecto-nucleotidases plays a role in the regulation of purinergic signaling, recent studies indicate that chronic hypoxic exposure of pulmonary artery endothelial cells can decrease the rate of ecto-nucleotidase activity (26Gerasimovskaya E.V. Ahmad S. White C.W. Jones P.L. Carpenter T.C. Stenmark K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44638-44650Google Scholar). In addition, it also has been reported that certain pathological conditions, especially those associated with endothelial cell activation, can decrease ATP-diphosphorylase activity (27Robson S.C. Kaczmarek E. Siegel G.B. Candinas D. Koziac K. Milan M. Hancock W.W. Bach F.H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 153-163Google Scholar), suggesting that pathological conditions affecting blood vessels contribute to local elevations in nucleotide concentrations in the vessel wall. The P2Y2 receptor is up-regulated in activated thymocytes (28Koshiba M. Apasov S. Sverdlov P. Chen P. Erb L. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. Sitkovsky M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 831-836Google Scholar) and in epithelial cells in response to ligation of the salivary gland duct (29Turner J.T. Park M. Camden J.M. Weisman G.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 842: 70-75Google Scholar). It is now becoming apparent that P2Y2 receptor up-regulation occurs in various models of vascular injury including balloon denudation of the rat aorta (9Seye C.I. Gadeau A.P. Daret D. Dupuch F. Alzieu P. Capron L. Desgranges C. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3602-3610Google Scholar) and placement of a silicone collar around the rabbit carotid artery (10Seye C.I. Kong Q. Erb L. Garrad R. Wang M. Turner J. Sturek M. Gonzalez F.A. Weisman G.A. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2720-2726Google Scholar). In the latter model, we showed that activation of the P2Y2 receptor by UTP stimulated intimal hyperplasia and induced monocyte/macrophage infiltration into the vessel wall, suggesting a potential role for this receptor in monocyte recruitment by vascular endothelium. The relative equipotency and equiefficacy of UTP and ATP for induction of VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC (Fig. 1) strongly suggests the involvement of P2Y2 receptors. Nonetheless, the ability of antisense, but not sense, P2Y2 oligonucleotides to inhibit UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression (Fig. 5) unambiguously demonstrates the role of P2Y2 receptors. Furthermore, UTP stimulated the expression of VCAM-1 in human 1321N1 astrocytoma cells expressing recombinant P2Y2 receptors but not in control 1321N1 cells (Fig. 6) that lack endogenous P2 receptors (22Parr C.E. Sullivan D.M. Paradiso A.M. Lazarowski E.R. Burch L.H. Olsen J.C. Erb L. Weisman G.A. Boucher R.C. Turner J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3275-3279Google Scholar). Moreover, the inability of 2MeS-ATP and UDP to induce VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC suggests that activation of P2Y1, P2Y4, and P2Y6 receptors is not involved. Stimulation of the P2Y2 receptor in endothelial cells is known to activate a variety of signaling molecules including the mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, the small GTPase RhoA, and the release of the second messenger Ca2+ into the cytoplasm (23Chaulet H.

Physiol. 2000; 278: H1751-H1761Google Scholar). In this study, UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression in HCAEC was prevented by the calcium chelator BAPTA or by depletion of intracellular calcium stores with thapsigargin (Fig. 4), indicating a role for P2Y2 receptor-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i in VCAM-1 expression. UTP-induced VCAM-1 expression also was suppressed by inhibitors of p38 and Rho kinase but not by inhibition of ERK1/2 (Fig. 7), suggesting that p38 and RhoA are involved in the increased expression of VCAM-1 mediated by P2Y2 receptors. Vascular endothelial growth factor induces VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and E-selectin expression in endothelial cells through a pathway involving the MEK/ERK-independent activation of NF-κB (30Kim I. Moon S. Kim S.H. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Google Scholar). Activation of the P2Y2 receptor has been reported to increase prostacyclin and nitric oxide release from endothelial cells (31Lustig K.D. Erb L. Landis D.M. Hicks-Taylor C.S. Zhang X. Sportiello M.G. Weisman G.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1134: 61-71Google Scholar, 32Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33057-33063Google Scholar). Studies have shown that nitric oxide modulates the level of VCAM-1 protein expression in endothelial cells (33De Caterina R. Libby P. Peng H.B. Thannickal V.J. Rajavashisth T.B. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Shin W.S. Liao J.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 60-68Google Scholar). Although nitric oxide did not play a role in vascular endothelial growth factor-induced adhesion molecule expression (30Kim I. Moon S. Kim S.H. Kim H.J. Koh Y.S. Koh G.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7614-7620Google Scholar), it could potentially modulate the effects of UTP on VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. Further studies are needed to identify the factors involved in nucleotide-induced VCAM-1 expression both at the transcriptional and translational levels. Consistent with earlier reports showing that ATP and UTP stimulate cell-cell adhesion in a monocyte/macrophage lineage and enhance neutrophil adherence to endothelial cell monolayers (16Ventura M.A. Thomopoulus P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 104-107Google Scholar), our data demonstrate that ATP and UTP stimulate U937 monocyte adherence to HCAEC (Fig. 8). The P2Y2 receptor contains the integrin binding domain arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) in its first extracellular loop (21Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrard R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Google Scholar). The RGD motif has been shown to be the core recognition sequence for many integrins including αvβ3 and αvβ5 (34Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that the RGD sequence in the P2Y2 receptor mediates its interaction with αvβ3/β5 integrins, and is required for Go-mediated signal transduction (21Erb L. Liu J. Ockerhausen J. Kong Q. Garrard R.C. Griffin K. Neal C. Krugh B. Santiago-Perez L.I. Gonzalez F.A. Gresham H.D. Turner J.T. Weisman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 491-501Google Scholar). It has been reported previously that the αvβ3 integrin on monocytes mediates their adherence to endothelial and epithelial cells, an early event in the acute inflammatory response (35Beekhuizen H. van Furth R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 363-378Google Scholar). Thus, protein complex formation between αvβ3/β5 integrins and P2Y2 receptors also may be involved in the regulation of monocyte binding to endothelial cells mediated by P2Y2 receptors. In summary, this study is the first to demonstrate that extracellular nucleotides and P2Y2 receptor activation can induce VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells and promote the adherence of monocytes. In combination with our previous studies, these results indicate that P2Y2 receptor up-regulation in vascular cells mediates the nucleotide-stimulated proliferation of smooth muscle cells and the adherence of monocytes to endothelium, responses associated with intimal hyperplasia and inflammation seen in atherosclerosis. These results encourage the development of therapeutic strategies to limit P2Y2 receptor up-regulation and activation as a means to prevent arterial disease.

https://openalex.org/W2123669549,"δEF1 and SIP1 (or Zfhx1a and Zfhx1b, respectively) are the only known members of the vertebrate Zfh1 family of homeodomain/zinc finger-containing proteins. Similar to other transcription factors, both Smad-interacting protein-1 (SIP1) and δEF1 are capable of repressing E-cadherin transcription through binding to the E2 boxes located in its promoter. In the case of δEF1, this repression has been proposed to occur via interaction with the corepressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP). In this study, we show by coimmunoprecipitation that SIP1 and CtBP interact in vivo and that an isolated CtBP-binding SIP1 fragment depends on CtBP for transcriptional repression. However, and most importantly, full-length SIP1 and δEF1 proteins do not depend on their interaction with CtBP to repress transcription from the E-cadherin promoter. Furthermore, in E-cadherin-positive kidney epithelial cells, the conditional synthesis of mutant SIP1 that cannot bind to CtBP abrogates endogenous E-cadherin expression in a similar way as wild-type SIP1. Our results indicate that full-length SIP1 can repress E-cadherin in a CtBP-independent manner. δEF1 and SIP1 (or Zfhx1a and Zfhx1b, respectively) are the only known members of the vertebrate Zfh1 family of homeodomain/zinc finger-containing proteins.

Lai Z.C. Rubin G.M. Mech. Dev. 1991; 34: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) and has eight zinc fingers, seven of which are grouped in two clusters, and one homeodomain-like motif (2Verschueren K. Remacle J.E.

SIP1 therefore belongs to the small Zfh1x gene family of transcriptional repressors, with the only other vertebrate member being δEF1 (3Funahashi J. Sekido R. Murai K. Kamachi Y. Kondoh H. Development. 1993; 119: 433-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although DNA binding activity has been determined for the isolated zinc finger clusters (C-terminal zinc finger cluster (CZF)) of SIP1 and δEF1 (2Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The zinc finger clusters specifically recognize CACCT(G) DNA motifs, and SIP1/δEF1 full-size proteins demonstrate the highest DNA binding efficiency in vitro when both zinc finger clusters are intact and when two spaced CACCT motifs are present in the target DNA (4Remacle J.E.

SIP1 (ZEB2; Zfhx1b) has meanwhile been characterized in several species including mouse, human, and frog (2Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L.

Hirano T. Hibi M. Miki N. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, the gene encoding the transmembrane protein E-cadherin, a major player in homotypic cell adhesion, has been identified as a target for transcriptional repression by δEF1 and SIP1 in vitro (10Grooteclaes M.L. Frisch S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 11Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Huylebroeck D. van Roy F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). SIP1-knockout mouse embryos clearly show up-regulation of E-cadherin in the neuroepithelium and the neural tube where SIP1 is normally expressed (12Van de Putte T. Maruhashi M. Francis A. Nelles L. Kondoh H. Huylebroeck H. Higashi Y. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 465-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Many potential target promoters have been identified for both SIP1 and δEF1, but the precise mechanism of action of these repressors is still unknown. In the case of the E-cadherin promoter and its regulation by δEF1, the corepressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) was proposed to be necessary for transcriptional repression (10Grooteclaes M.L. Frisch S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). CtBP was originally identified as a protein that interacts with the C-terminal segment of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein via a PLDLS sequence in the latter (13Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and interacts with a growing list of transcription factors from Drosophila and vertebrates (14Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 15Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Two highly related CtBP proteins, CtBP1 and CtBP2, have been identified in vertebrates and have overlapping but also unique roles during embryogenesis, as shown by loss-of-function studies in the mouse (16Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although it has been shown recently (17Kumar V. Carlson J.E. Ohgi K.A. Edwards T.A. Rose D.W. Escalante C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Aggarwal A.K. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 857-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) that CtBP possesses dehydrogenase activity, the precise mechanism by which CtBP represses transcription is still subject to controversy as well. Both SIP1 and δEF1 have three PXDLS motifs, and interaction between CtBP and those domains has been shown in vitro (6Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6391-6396Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 18Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition, CtBP significantly enhances the repression mediated by full-length δEF1 of the muscle creatine kinase enhancer (19Furusawa T. Moribe H. Kondoh H. Higashi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8581-8590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, using truncated δEF1 proteins, two studies demonstrated that intact CtBP-binding motifs are necessary for these δEF1 polypeptides to repress the human E-cadherin promoter in luciferase reporter assays (10Grooteclaes M.L. Frisch S.M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3823-3828Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 20Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we investigate the possible role of CtBP in SIP1-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin. We show that anti-CtBP antibodies can immunoprecipitate endogenous CtBP·SIP1 complexes from a human breast carcinoma cell line (MDA-MB435S) and from human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells. By using the CtBP-interaction domain (CID) of SIP1, we observe a CtBP-dependent repression when recruited to the SV40 early promoter or an E-cadherin promoter-driven luciferase reporter. In contrast, full-length SIP1 and δEF1 proteins do not need CtBP-binding sites to repress the E-cadherin gene in reporter assays nor is CtBP binding necessary for endogenous transcriptional repression of E-cadherin by SIP1 in cultures of dog kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells. Plasmids and Reagents—pCS3 with inserts of Myc-tagged wild-type or the double zinc finger mutant of mouse SIP1 cDNA were described previously (2Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T. Bodmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The 3xCtBPmut and 4xCtBPmut SIP1 mutants were generated by PCR and verified by sequencing before exchanging an SmaI insert containing these mutations with the corresponding fragment of wild-type SIP1 cDNA in pCS3. Mouse CtBP2 was obtained by PCR from mouse testis mRNA and cloned in-frame with a FLAG tag in pCDNA3.1. Human CtBP1 and CtBP1-VP16 were obtained from V. Kumar (La Jolla, CA). For the UAS-SV40-luciferase assays, the GBD fusion proteins studied here were obtained by cloning the complete open reading frame of mouse SIP1 and the SIP1CtBPmut in-frame with the DNA-binding domain of the yeast GAL4 protein (in pBind, Promega). A UAS-SV40 promoter luciferase vector was created by cloning five GAL4-binding sites (5xUAS of pGL5; Promega) in front of the SV40 early promoter in pGL3 (Promega). GBD-SIP1CID and GBD-SIP1CID-mut were generated by a similar in-frame cloning of a product, generated by PCR, that comprises the wild-type CID or 3xCtBPmut CID of mouse SIP1 (CID, as it is used here, encompasses amino acids 737–871 of SIP1). The same fragments were used to generate the CZF-CID SIP1 polypeptide and corresponding CID mutant by cloning these cDNAs in-frame with the CZF-encoding cDNA of mouse SIP1 (CZF, as it is used here, encompassed amino acids 982–1107 of SIP1). These mutations were first generated by PCR, and the fragments were cloned in-frame with six Myc tags and the SV40 T-antigen nuclear localization signal (NLS) in pCS2-NLS-Myc, thereby generating pCS2-NLS-Myc-CZF-CID vectors. For the generation of inducible expression plasmids of SIP1, the pTRE plasmid (Clontech) was used to clone a hygromycin resistance cassette under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter (pTHyg) in the unique HindIII site, together with the different Myc-tagged SIP1 open reading frames taken from wild-type SIP1 in pCS3 (see above), CtBPmut (this paper), and the zinc finger mutations (4Remacle J.E.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) downstream of a human cytomegalovirus-based enhancer/promoter containing six Tet-responsive elements. Wild-type and CtBPmut δEF1 cDNAs were gifts from Y. Higashi (Osaka, Japan), and the wild-type and mutant E1A cDNAs were obtained from R. Goodman (Portland, OR). Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal α-CtermSIP1 antiserum raised against a SIP1-specific peptide, the sequence of which is conserved between human and mouse SIP1 (i.e. CSDSEERESMPRDGES), was used at 1:1000 dilution in Western analysis; rabbit polyclonal α-NtermSIP1 antiserum was raised against another peptide (amino acids 26–129 of mouse SIP1). The rat monoclonal antibody DECMA-1 (Sigma) recognizes both mouse and dog E-cadherin and was used at 1:100 for immunofluorescence. Mouse anti-Myc tag antibody (1:200 for immunofluorescence and 1:3000 for Western analysis), mouse anti-GBD antibody (1:3000 for Western analysis), and a rabbit anti-CtBP antiserum, which recognizes both CtBP1 and CtBP2 in mouse, human, and dog (1:200 for Western analysis), were also used in this study (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transient Transfections and Reporter Assays—Transient transfections for luciferase assays were done with 25-kDa branched polyethyleneimine (Aldrich, method described in Ref. 21Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 9Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar), using 1.2 μl of 1 mg of polyethyleneimine/ml of stock solution per 300 ng of DNA transfected per well of a 24-well plate. In the case of HEK293T cells, ∼45,000 cells/cm2 were seeded, whereas for C90 and C86 fibroblasts 11,000 and 16,000 cells, respectively, were seeded per cm2. Transfections were carried out 1 day later with 100 ng of E-cadherin promoter luciferase (11Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Huylebroeck D. van Roy F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar) or 50 ng of UAS-SV40 promoter luciferase reporter plasmid and with the SIP1 and CtBP expression plasmids as indicated. For normalization, 15 ng of a lacZ reporter construct that contains the cytomegalovirus promoter inserted upstream of Escherichia coli lacZ were cotransfected. Cell extracts were prepared and assayed for luciferase activity and β-galactosidase activity according to the manufacturers' protocols (luciferase assay system (Promega) and Galscreen™ (Tropix), respectively), and only transfections with similar β-galactosidase values were taken into account. The data, obtained in triplicate experiments, were then normalized by calculating the ratio of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities. When the lysates were also used for Western analysis, one-fifth of the lysates was used to run on an 8% SDS-PAGE followed by Western detection of the produced proteins by means of anti-Myc antibodies and subsequent visualization using the Western Lightning detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For immunoprecipitation of SIP1·CtBP complexes, HEK293T cells were transfected at 50% confluency with a total of 4 μg of DNA and 16 μl of polyethyleneimine solution, harvested the next day, and immediately frozen down. Immunoprecipitations of overexpressed/endogenous proteins and the Western analysis were carried out as described previously (22van Grunsven L.A. Billon N. Savatier P. Thomas A. Urdiales J.L. Rudkin B.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1347-1356PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous CtBP·SIP1 complexes, 20 × 106 cells were used of each cell line, and 5 μg of CtBP antibody were used per immunoprecipitation. DNA precipitations (DNAP) were carried out as described (23Hata A. Seoane J. Lagna G. Montalvo E. Hemmati-Brivanlou A. Massague J. Cell. 2000; 100: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding 1 UAS (GAL4-binding upstream activating sequence; 5′-TCTAGACGGAGTACTGTCCTCCGACTCGAG-3′). Cell Culture and Generation of MDCK Cell Lines—Monolayer cultures of HEK293T, HepG2, and MDCK-Tet-off cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MDA-MB435S cells and the CtBP+/- and CtBP-/- fibroblasts (the fibroblasts were a kind gift from P. Soriano, Seattle, WA) were grown in the same medium but supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine. MCF7 cells were cultured as described (24Bracke M.E. Van Larebeke N.A. Vyncke B.M. Mareel M.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1991; 63: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For the generation of the MDCK-Tet-SIP1 cells, 24 h after seeding, the MDCK-Tet-off cells (24,000 cells/cm2) were transfected with 2 μg of the respective linearized pTRE-TKHyg-SIP1 plasmids (wild-type SIP1, SIP1CtBP-mut and SIP1ZF-mut) using 6 μl of FuGENE (Roche Applied Science). The next day, these cells were split 1:23, and stable transformants were selected in 0.1 mg of hygromycin B/ml (Roche Applied Science) for 2 weeks. SIP1 expression was prevented by adding tetracycline to the cultures during selection for hygromycin resistance (1–2 μg of Tet/ml, Sigma). Surviving clones were tested for inducibility and synthesis of the Myc-SIP1 proteins by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Representative clones were then verified for the incorporation of the different mutant constructs by PCR and sequence analysis. For the analysis of SIP1-mediated transcriptional repression of E-cadherin, the different cell lines were seeded on glass coverslips at a density of 16,000 cells/cm2 in the absence or presence of tetracycline, as indicated. After 4 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and analyzed for Myc-SIP1 and E-cadherin production using standard immunohistochemistry techniques. Two-hybrid Mating Assays in Yeast—These were performed by the interaction trap cloning method, which is often referred to as the LexA two-hybrid system (25Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar). The inter-zinc finger region of both mouse SIP1 (defined here as from amino acids 315–942) and mouse δEF1 (from amino acids 330–909) were cloned in-frame with the LexA DNA-binding domain (pGilda (Clontech), the bait plasmid) as well as the complete open reading frame of mouse CtBP2. For the LexA-mSIP1CtBP-mut, the same region (amino acids 315–942) but containing the SIP1 3xCtBPmut was used. The open reading frame of mouse CtBP2 as well as the open reading frames of human Smad1–4, mouse Smad5–7, and rat Smad8 were cloned in-frame with the activation domain of pB42 (Clontech, the prey vector). Transformation of yeast and the two-hybrid mating assays were performed as described (26Finley Jr., R.L. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). CtBP Binds to SIP1 through Conserved PXDLS-like Motifs— SIP1 (also named Zfhx1b) and δEF1 (Zfhx1a) share similarity not only in the two zinc finger clusters (NZF and CZF) that are necessary for DNA binding but also in the relative position of the CID to these clusters. For SIP1, three PXDLS-like motifs are located in a 78-amino acid-long domain (amino acids 737–871) that is situated inbetween NZF and CZF (Fig. 1A). Unlike δEF1, SIP1 has an additional PXDLS-like motif (PLRLT) in front of the three motifs that they have in common (Fig. 1A). Besides the zinc fingers and the CID, SIP1 also has a Smad-binding domain that shows only 30% identity with δEF1 (2Verschueren K. Remacle J.E. Collart C. Kraft H. Baker B.S. Tylzanowski P. Nelles L. Wuytens G. Su M.T. Bodmer R. Smith J.C. Huylebroeck D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20489-20498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). This low conservation in sequence is directly reflected by the inability of δEF1 to interact with receptor-regulated Smads (RSmads, Fig. 1B). When fused to the DNA-binding domain of LexA, the inter-zinc finger region of both SIP1 (segment 315–942) and δEF1 (segment 330–909) was found to bind to full-length CtBP2 (fused to the activation domain of B42; B42AD) in a yeast two-hybrid mating assay. In contrast, only SIP1 was binding to the B42AD-RSmads 1–3, 5, and 8 fusion proteins. Moreover, weak staining indicates that SIP1 does not show strong direct interaction with Smads 4, 6, and 7 (Fig. 1B). Mutation of PXDLS motifs in other proteins that bind CtBP affects their capacity to interact with CtBP (13Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). We used yeast mating assays and coimmunoprecipitation experiments to investigate whether combined mutation of the three SIP1 PXDLS motifs was sufficient to abolish the binding with CtBP. In the LexA-SIP1 protein, all three CtBP-binding sites (PLNLS, PLDLS, and PLNLT) were mutated to AAALS, AAALS, and AAALT, respectively, to create LexA-SIP1CtBP-mut (Fig. 1A). This SIP1CtBP-mut protein clearly did not interact with mouse CtBP2 when coexpressed in yeast (Fig. 1C), whereas it was still capable of interacting with Smads, e.g. Smad1 and Smad2. As reported before (27Sewalt R.G.A.B. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P.E. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), CtBP has the capacity to form homodimers (Fig. 1C). The additional PXDLS-like motif (PLRLT) sequence, however, does not seem to be sufficient for binding to CtBP because a LexA-SIP1 fusion that carries mutations in the other three CtBP-binding sites no longer interacted with CtBP (Fig. 1C). Although overexpression of a 120-amino acid-long polypeptide of human SIP1 revealed binding to overexpressed CtBP, there is no report describing the interaction of full-length SIP1/ZEB2 with CtBP. Therefore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed to test whether full-length mouse SIP1 interacts with CtBP and whether this interaction is disrupted by the aforementioned PXDLS mutations, but now introduced in full-length SIP1. Expression vectors encoding either wild-type or mutant Myc-SIP1 were cotransfected with a FLAG-tagged human CtBP1 or a FLAG-tagged mouse CtBP2 construct into HEK293T cells. Extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotted with an anti-Myc antibody. Myc-tagged SIP1 was only coimmunoprecipitated when the CtBP-binding sites were intact but not when the three PXDLS motifs were mutated (Fig. 1D). Therefore, full-length wild-type SIP1 can interact with CtBPs, and this interaction is abolished when the three PXDLS motifs are mutated. SIP1 Interacts with CtBP in Vivo—In several human carcinoma cell lines, the levels of E-cadherin RNA and protein are inversely correlated with SIP1 expression (11Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P.

The human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB435S contains high levels of SIP1, whereas E-cadherin is undetectable, which is in contrast with other cell lines (e.g. MCF7 cells) that express no SIP1 and have high levels of E-cadherin. In addition, in SIP1-knockout mouse embryos, E-cadherin transcription as well as E-cadherin protein levels are up-regulated in the neuroepithelium and the neural tube (tissues in which SIP1 is expressed in normal embryos) (12Van de Putte T.

Furthermore, SIP1 can bind to, and transcriptionally repress, the E-cadherin promoter (11Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Huylebroeck D. van Roy F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate whether the SIP1-CtBP interaction plays a crucial role in the SIP1-mediated repression of E-cadherin transcription. To start this, the existence of endogenous SIP1·CtBP protein complexes was verified. First, specificity of raised polyclonal anti-SIP1 antibodies was determined by Western blotting of endogenous SIP1 complexes immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the N-terminal part of SIP1 (α-NtermSIP1; this study) or the C-terminal part of SIP1 (α-CtermSIP1 (11Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L. Bruyneel E. Mareel M. Huylebroeck D. van Roy F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar)) from MDA-MB435S cells. Fig. 2B shows that both antibodies could immunoprecipitate a protein of ±170 kDa that is recognized by the α-CtermSIP1 antibody. The α-NtermSIP1 antibody is SIP1-specific as illustrated in Fig. 2A. The α-NtermSIP1 antibody only immunoprecipitated overexpressed Myc-tagged SIP1 and not Myc-tagged δEF1, whereas anti-αMyc antibodies immunoprecipitated both tagged proteins. Subsequently, we used MDA-MB435S and HEK293T cells to determine whether SIP1 and CtBP interact at endogenous levels. To this end, extracts from these cells and from MCF7 and HepG2 cells (these two cell lines do not express SIP1 RNA; data not shown (11Comijn J. Berx G. Vermassen P. Verschueren K. van Grunsven L.

Cell. 2001; 7: 1267-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar)) were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against CtBP1/2 and immunoblotted with the α-CtermSIP1 antibody. Although CtBP is present in every cell line and was immunoprecipitated, Fig. 2C clearly shows that the SIP1 protein was coimmunoprecipitated with CtBP only in the cells that express SIP1, i.e. MDA-MB435S and HEK293T. This demonstrates that SIP1 and CtBP interact at endogenous levels. The CtBP Interaction Domain of DNA-bound SIP1 Is Not Required to Mediate Repression in a Full-size Context—Many CtBP-interacting transcriptional regulators have been described (for reviews see Refs. 14Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar and 15Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) and demonstration that these proteins mediate repression in a CtBP-dependent manner relied on testing the activity of fusions between the CtBP-interaction domain of that protein and the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 (GBD). These fusion proteins are targeted via multiple Gal4-binding sites (UAS) to reporter constructs whose transcription is activated by strong promoters (e.g. the SV40 early promoter). By using this experimental set-up, we transfected wild-type GBD-SIP1 full-length (GBD-SIPFL) or a SIP1-CtBP mutant (GBD-SIPFL-mut) but also wild-type or mutated CID (GBD-SIP1CID and GBD-SIP1CID-mut, respectively; CID is defined as a fragment encompassing amino acids 737–871) encoding constructs in HEK293T cells, along with a UAS-SV40-luciferase construct. Fig. 3A shows that both SIP1FL and SIP1CID repressed the activity of the SV40 early promoter. However, mutation of the CtBP-binding sites did not abolish repression by SIPFL, although it completely abrogated the repression mediated by SIP1CID. This clearly suggests that in the full-size context of SIP1 the PXDLS domains are not necessary for repression in this assay. To verify whether or not this result is due to the inability of CtBP to bind to full-length SIP1 under these experimental conditions, we used again the UAS-SV40-luciferase reporter assay, but in addition to the GBD-SIP1 constructs, we cotransfected CtBP-VP16, a fusion protein containing the strong transactivation domain of the herpes simplex virus transcriptional regulatory protein VP16. In such a two-hybrid type of approach, the interaction between SIP1 and CtBP1 resulted in a strong activation of luciferase synthesis when the CID of SIP1 was assayed (Fig. 3B, GBD-SIP1 CID + CtBP1-VP16), and in a weak activation when full-length SIP1 was used (from a 40% repression without CtBP-VP16 to a 2-fold activation with CtBP-VP16). Deletion of the CtBP-binding sites clearly abolished the interaction of CtBP-VP16 with both GBD-SIP1CID and GBD-SIPFL. This confirms that CtBP can bind to full-length SIP1 when tethered to DNA. To rule out the possibility that the lower transactivation capacity of CtBP-VP16 in complex with GBD-SIPFL would be due a low affinity of CtBP for DNA-bound full-length SIP1, DNA precipitations were carried out.

In yeast, GPI mediates cross-linking of cell wall mannoproteins to β1,6-glucan. We reported previously that the GWT1 gene product is a target of the novel anti-fungal compound, 1-[4-butylbenzyl]isoquinoline, that inhibits cell wall localization of GPI-anchored mannoproteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Tsukahara, K., Hata, K., Sagane, K., Watanabe, N., Kuromitsu, J., Kai, J., Tsuchiya, M., Ohba, F., Jigami, Y., Yoshimatsu, K., and Nagasu, T. (2003) Mol. Microbiol. 48, 1029–1042). In the present study, to analyze the function of the Gwt1 protein, we isolated temperature-sensitive gwt1 mutants. The gwt1 cells were normal in transport of invertase and carboxypeptidase Y but were delayed in transport of GPI-anchored protein, Gas1p, and were defective in its maturation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. The incorporation of inositol into GPI-anchored proteins was reduced in gwt1 mutant, indicating involvement of GWT1 in GPI biosynthesis. We analyzed the early steps of GPI biosynthesis in vitro by using membranes prepared from gwt1 and Δgwt1 cells. The synthetic activity of GlcN-(acyl)PI from GlcN-PI was defective in these cells, whereas Δgwt1 cells harboring GWT1 gene restored the activity, indicating that GWT1 is required for acylation of inositol during the GPI synthetic pathway. We further cloned GWT1 homologues in other yeasts, Cryptococcus neoformans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and confirmed that the specificity of acyl-CoA in inositol acylation, as reported in studies of endogenous membranes (Franzot, S. P., and Doering, T. L. (1999) Biochem. J. 340, 25–32), is due to the properties of Gwt1p itself and not to other membrane components.

GPI biosynthesis is essential for embryogenesis in mice and for growth of yeast cells (1Leidich S.D. Drapp D.A. Orlean P. J. Biol.

In the genome of budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ∼60 open reading frames (ORFs) are predicted to encode GPI-anchored proteins (4Caro L.H. Tettelin H. Vossen J.H. Ram A.F. van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Yeast. 1997; 13: 1477-1489Google Scholar). Most of these proteins are covalently linked to β1,6-glucan of the cell wall component through the GPI portion (5Smits G.J. van den Ende H. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 781-794Google Scholar, 6Shahinian S. Bussey H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 477-489Google Scholar). Some of them, including Gas1p, are anchored to the plasma membrane (7Nuoffer C. Jeno P. Conzelmann A. Riezman H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 27-37Google Scholar). GPI-anchored proteins contain a signal peptide for secretion at the N terminus and a hydrophobic GPI attachment signal sequence at the C terminus (8Udenfriend S. Kodukula K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 563-591Google Scholar). GPI has the conserved core structure NH2–CH2–CH2–PO4–6Manα1,2-Manα1,6-Manα1,4-GlcNα1,6Ins-PO4–lipid (9Puoti A. Conzelmann A. J. Biol.

It is modified by addition of acyl chain to the inositol portion, and by addition of phosphoethanolamine to the first and possibly second mannose (Man) portion (11Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A.

Yeast and parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, have a modification in which α1,2-linked Man is attached to the third Man of the above GPI core structure (14Sipos G. Puoti A. Conzelmann A.

Schwarz R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2597-2606Google Scholar). After GPI maturation, which includes phosphoethanolamine attachment to the third and/or second Man, the modified GPI is transferred to the newly exposed C terminus of precursor proteins by transamidase. The resulting GPI-anchored proteins are efficiently packed into vesicles that are somewhat different from those containing other secretory proteins and that transported them to the Golgi (17Sutterlin C.

This modification renders GPI precursors resistant to cleavage by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Although inositol acylation occurs after mannosylation of GlcN-PI in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei (23Guther M.L. Ferguson M.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Google Scholar, 24Smith T.K. Sharma D.K.

These results were confirmed in vivo using mannose donor (dolichol-P-Man)-defective mutants that accumulate GlcN-(acyl)PI in yeast (27Urakaze M. Kamitani T. DeGasperi R. Sugiyama E. Chang H.M.

Falck J.R. Lehrman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27031-27038Google Scholar). Yeast membranes utilize exogenous acyl-CoA as a donor in inositol acylation (29Franzot S.P. Doering T.L. Biochem.

However, in the GPI biosynthetic pathway, the gene responsible for inositol acylation of GlcN-PI has not yet been identified, and it is unclear whether acylation precedes the “flip-flop” involving GPI translocation from the cytoplasmic side to luminal side of ER membranes (26Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Google Scholar). It is reported that de-acetylation, which precedes acylation, occurs on the cytoplasmic side, whereas the first mannosylation, which follows acylation, occurs on the luminal side of ER membranes (31Watanabe R. Ohishi K. Maeda Y. Nakamura N. Kinoshita T. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 185-192Google Scholar, 33Maeda Y. Watanabe R. Harris C.L. Hong Y. Ohishi K. Kinoshita K. Kinoshita T.

This raises the question whether inositol acylation occurs on the cytoplasmic or luminal side. We recently reported (43Tsukahara K. Hata K. Sagane K. Watanabe N. Kuromitsu J. Kai J. Tsuchiya M. Ohba F. Jigami Y. Yoshimatsu K. Nagasu T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1029-1042Google Scholar) a novel compound, 1-[4-butylbenzyl]isoquinoline (BIQ), that inhibits cell wall localization of GPI-anchored mannoproteins in S. cerevisiae, and we identified a novel uncharacterized gene, GWT1, as a target of this compound. GWT1 gene-deleted (Δgwt1) cells showed a defect in cell wall assembly and extremely slow growth. In the present study, we isolated temperature-sensitive mutants of GWT1 (gwt1) to investigate the function of Gwt1p. Maturation and/or transport of the GPI-anchored protein, Gas1p, judged by the extent of glycosylation from the ER to Golgi, is impaired in the gwt1 mutant. Theses findings suggest that GWT1 may be involved in GPI biosynthesis, in GPI transfer to proteins, or in GPI-anchored protein transport from ER to Golgi. We also performed in vitro assay for the early steps of GPI biosynthesis by using membranes prepared from gwt1 and Δgwt1 cells, and we confirmed that synthetic activity of GlcN-(acyl)PI from GlcN-PI during the GPI biosynthetic pathway is defective, i.e. GWT1 is required for acylation of inositol in GPI biosynthesis.

Multicopy expression plasmid YEp352-GWT1 (YG) was constructed by replacing the GWT1 fragment of pRS315-GWT1 (pG) into the multicopy plasmid YEp352. Constitutively high level expression plasmid pGAP-ScGWT1, in which expression of GWT1 is under the control of GAPDH promoter, was made by using PCR to amplify the GWT1 coding region, and cloning the fragment between GAPDH promoter and GAPDH terminator of the multicopy plasmid YEp352GAPII, yielding pGAP-ScGWT1. In Vitro Mutagenesis of GWT1 and Isolation of Temperature-sensitive gwt1 Mutants—Temperature-sensitive (Ts–) alleles of GWT1 were generated by PCR mutagenesis as described by Muhlrad et al.

GWT1 was amplified under mutagenic PCR conditions using forward primer (5′-TGTGCCTACAGAGCAGCCGACTGCAAT-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TCAACAACTAATGTACCTAGTAGGCAGGAG-3′). These PCRs contained the following components: 1× reaction buffer (Takara Shuzo); 50–100 ng of pRS315-GWT1 as template plasmid; 0.8 mm each primer; 2.5 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 0.1 mm dATP; 5 units of LA Taq DNA polymerase (Takara Shuzo). The mutagenized GWT1 PCR product and a gapped plasmid were co-transformed into haploid strain Δ/YG, which is a gwt1 disrupted (Δgwt1) strain harboring YEp352-GWT1 plasmid. The gapped plasmid was prepared by removing a 2012-bp SalI-BglII fragment of the GWT1 gene in pRS315-GWT1 plasmid. Gap-repaired Leu+ transformants were transferred to medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select YEp352-GWT1 loss strains. Ura– segregants were screened for temperature sensitivity at 37 °C into YPAD medium. The mutation points of mutagenized GWT1 plasmid on potential Ts– mutants were determined by sequencing the coding region of GWT1 gene. Mutagenized GWT1 was subcloned into an integration vector pRS304 or pRS306 and integrated into the trp1 or ura3 locus on the chromosome of WDG2, which is a GWT1/Δgwt1 diploid strain (Table I). Trp+ or Ura+ transformants were selected, and His+, Trp+ or Ura+ and Ts– segregants were identified after tetrad analysis. Plasmid Construction of pGAP-GFP-ScGwt1-His—GFP-ScGwt1-His chimera cDNA was constructed by connecting each DNA fragment sequentially. The ORF of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in pEGFP-N2 (Clontech) was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GCGCTCGAGACCACCATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAG-3′ and 5′-GGTGAATTCCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGCCG-3′. S. cerevisiae GWT1 ORF was amplified using the primers 5′-ACAGAATTCACCATGTCGACTTTAAAACAGAGAAAAGAGG-3′ and 5′-TGTGGTACCTAGCTTAATGAATATTCTTTTTCTATACAA-3′. The His6 epitope tag adaptor 5′-GGTACCGGAGGACATCATCATCATCATCATTAACGTACCCGGG-3′ was added to the 3′-end of the GFP-ScGwt1 fusion construct. The resulting GFP-ScGwt1-His cassette was inserted into the low copy expression vector pRS314 or the multicopy expression vector YEp352GAPII under the control of GAPDH promoter, yielding pRS314-GFP-ScGWT1 or pGAP-GFP-ScGWT1-His. Fluorescence Microscopy—For imaging of GFP-ScGwt1-His fusion protein, cells grown to exponential phase were collected by centrifugation, fixed by 70% ethanol for 30 min, washed twice with distilled water, stained with 100 ng/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 15 min, and visualized by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX-70 fluorescent microscope system. Images were acquired by a digital charge-coupled device camera and processed by CoolSNAP software (Olympus). Invertase Activity Staining—Cells were pre-cultured in 3 ml of YPAD medium at 24 or 37 °C and then transferred to YPA medium containing 0.2% sucrose to induce invertase expression. After 3 h of incubation at the indicated temperatures, the cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 6% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, bromophenol blue). Cells were broken by mixing with glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma), and supernatants were recovered by centrifugation (13,000 × g). Then the samples were boiled and separated by SDS-PAGE. Mobility of invertase was detected by activity staining (47Gabriel O. Wang S.F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 545-554Google Scholar, 48Nagasu T. Shimma Y. Nakanishi Y. Kuromitsu J. Iwama K. Nakayama K. Suzuki K. Jigami Y. Yeast. 1992; 8: 535-547Google Scholar). Radiolabeling and Immunoprecipitation of Gas1p and CPY—Radio-labeling and immunoprecipitation were performed as described by Sutterlin et al. (17Sutterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmoller F. Schroder S. Riezman H. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2703-2714Google Scholar). Cells were grown to exponential phase in SD medium with low SO42− concentration as described above, then collected by centrifugation, and replaced SD-SO42– medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acid and ammonium sulfate, 2% glucose and required nutrients without methionine and cysteine) by low sulfate medium. Samples were preincubated for 15 min at the indicated temperatures and then pulse-labeled with 3.7 MBq of Express 35S-label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and chased. The chase was initiated by adding a 1/100 volume of chase liquid (0.3 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.3% methionine, 0.3% cysteine). Samples were chased for various periods, and then NaN3 and NaF (10 mm final concentration) were added. Labeled cells were washed, resuspended in TEPI buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, proteinase inhibitors (Complete, Roche Applied Science)), and broken by mixing with glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were solubilized by boiling with 1% SDS, combined with 1 ml of TNET buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100), and centrifuged at 13,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated with anti-Gas1p (kindly provided by Dr. Howard Riezman) or anti-CPY (Molecular Probes) antibodies and protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) for 3 h. The beads were washed with TNET buffer and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Immunoprecipitated samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). [3H]Inositol Labeling of Lipids and Proteins—Labeling of proteins and lipids with [3H]inositol was performed after cells were grown to exponential phase. Washed cells were resuspended in SD inositol-free medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without inositol and amino acid (Bio 101), 5% glucose, and nutrient supplements and then preincubated at the indicated temperature for 20 min. For labeling of lipids, myo-[2-3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the cell suspension and incubated for 1.5 h. Labeled lipids were extracted by shaking with glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma) in CHCl3/CH3OH/water (10:10:3 v/v), and purified by n-butyl alcohol extraction. The lipids were analyzed by TLC with solvent system CHCl3/CH3OH/water (10:10:3 v/v). For labeling of proteins, myo-[1,2-3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added and incubated at the indicated temperature for 1.5 h, and the labeling reaction was stopped by adding NaN3 and NaF. Labeled proteins were extracted by shaking with glass beads in TEPI buffer, and solubilized by boiling with 1% SDS. Samples were combined with ConA buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 13,000 × g. ConA-Sepharose (Amersham Bioscience) was added to the supernatants and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The Sepharose was washed with ConA buffer and then resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). In Vitro Assay for the Early Steps of GPI Biosynthesis—To prepare ER-enriched membranes, cells were grown in YPAD medium at 24 °C overnight. The cell pellet was washed with TM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2). After centrifugation, the cells were homogenized by mixing with glass beads (425–600 μm, Sigma), and cell lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g to remove cell debris, nuclei, and intact cells. ER-enriched membrane fraction was prepared by centrifugation of cell lysates at 13,000 × g and used for the in vitro assay for GPI biosynthetic pathway, as described by Costello and Orlean (22Costello L.C. Orlean P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8599-8603Google Scholar). Mixed membranes were incubated in TM buffer containing 2 mm MnCl2, 21 μg/ml tunicamycin, 10 μm nikkomycin, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, in the presence of 0.5–1 mm coenzyme A (CoA) and 1 mm ATP or 0.25 mm acyl-CoA. 4.44 kBq of UDP-[14C]GlcNAc (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to start the reaction. After incubation for 1 h at 24 or 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1 v/v), and the supernatant was separated and saved. The pellet was re-extracted by CHCl3/CH3OH/water (10:10:3 v/v). The lipid extracts were pooled, dried, and desalted by n-butyl alcohol extraction. Labeled lipid extracts were separated by TLC using Silica Gel 60 plate (Merck), with the solvent system CHCl3/CH3OH/1 m NH4OH (10:10:3 v/v). Reaction products separated on TLC plates were detected by autoradiography and analyzed by Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Enzyme Treatment of Radiolabeled Lipids—Radiolabeled lipids were treated with 0.5 units of PI-PLC prepared from Bacillus thuringiensis (ICN) in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2% Triton X-100. After incubation overnight at 37 °C, lipids were extracted with n-butyl alcohol and analyzed by TLC as described above. Cloning of C. neoformans GWT1 Genes—Genome DNA and mRNA were purified from C. neoformans number 3 strain (49Hata K. Kimura J. Miki H. Toyosawa T. Nakamura T. Katsu K. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 2237-2242Google Scholar). In order to identify C. neoformans GWT1 gene (CnGWT1), we performed a sequence homology data base search by using highly conserved regions among the species as query. The search revealed that shotgun genome sequences (502042C05.x1) derived from “The C. neoformans Genome Sequencing Project” (//sequence-www.stanford.edu/group/C.neoformans/index.html), and EST sequences (b6e06cn.f1) derived from “The C. neoformans cDNA Sequencing Project” (www.genome.ou.edu/cneo.html) were highly related to S. cerevisiae GWT1 (ScGWT1). Several primers were designed from the nucleotide information described above and were used to amplify CnGWT1 by genomic PCRs. A combination of the primers GW61F (5′-GCCATAATAAGCTACCGAATTGCAATG-3′) and GW52R (5′-CATTAACACCCCCATTGACAACCACG-3′) amplified a single band of a 1.9-kb DNA fragment from C. neoformans genomic DNA. However, this fragment was partial and did not cover the C-terminal conserved sequences. To identify the downstream flanking sequences, we performed 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends system (Invitrogen). 1.2 kb of cDNA fragment was amplified, using the gene-specific primer GW62F (5′-CATCTTGGCGGTAGATTTTGAAGTGTTCC-3′) and the Universal Amplification Primer included in the kit. Two additional primers, GW85F (5′-ATTTGAATTCACCATGGGGGATTACAAGTCGGCCAAA-3′) and GW87R (5′-CATGGTCGACACTTTAACTATATCTTGATCCTCC-3′), were designed to amplify the full-length CnGWT1 gene. Approximately 2.0 kb of DNA fragment was obtained by PCR from genomic DNA, and 1.8 kb of CnGWT1 cDNA was obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Amplified CnGWT1 cDNA was digested with EcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes and inserted into the yeast expression vector YEp352GAPII for further analysis, yielding pGAP-CnGWT1. Cloning of Schizosaccharomyces pombe GWT1 Gene—To clone the GWT1 homologue in S. pombe that was identified from the genome data base, YPD (Incyte Genomics, Inc.,), genomic DNAs were purified from S. pombe. Several primers were designed from the nucleotide information described above. A combination of the primers, SpGWT1-F (5′-CAATTGATGTCATACAAATTGGAAAAAGAAGCATTTGTC-3′) and SpGWT1-R (5′-GTCGACCTAAAGGCGAAAACGAATTCCGT-3′), amplified a 1.38-kb DNA fragment from the S. pombe genomic DNA. This fragment is covered by the ORF of GWT1 homologue of S. pombe (SpGWT1). The amplified SpGWT1 fragment was digested with MfeI and SalI restriction sites and inserted into the yeast expression vector YEp352GAPII for further analysis, yielding pGAP-SpGWT1. GFP-Gwt1 Is Localized in the ER—We recently reported a novel anti-fungal compound, 1-[4-butylbenzyl]isoquinoline (BIQ), that blocks surface expression of GPI-anchored mannoproteins in S. cerevisiae (43Tsukahara K. Hata K. Sagane K. Watanabe N. Kuromitsu J. Kai J. Tsuchiya M. Ohba F. Jigami Y. Yoshimatsu K. Nagasu T. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 1029-1042Google Scholar) and identified the uncharacterized gene GWT1 as a direct target of BIQ. To obtain information about Gwt1p function, we first tried using a low copy plasmid of the GFP-ScGWT-His fusion gene to analyze its cellular localization, but this was unsuccessful because of the low expression level of the fusion gene. Instead, we used a multicopy plasmid of the GFP-ScGWT1 fusion gene (pGAP-GFP-ScGWTHis) to visualize Gwt1p by fluorescence microscopy. The expression plasmid was transformed into wild type cells, and transformed cells were grown to exponential phase. As shown in Fig. 1, the GFP-ScGwt1-His fusion protein was detected at the peri-nuclear region characteristic of ER staining (50Sato K. Sato M. Nakano A. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 935-944Google Scholar). We confirmed that the majority of the fusion protein (GFP-ScGwt1-His) was almost intact by immunoblot analysis using anti-GFP and anti-His antibodies (data not shown). Moreo"

We report here that human MCM4, a subunit of the putative DNA replicative helicase, is extensively phosphorylated in HeLa cells when they are incubated in the presence of inhibitors of DNA synthesis or are exposed to UV irradiation. The data presented here indicate that the consecutive actions of ATR-CHK1 and CDK2 kinases are involved in this phosphorylation in the presence of hydroxyurea. The phosphorylation sites in MCM4 were identified using specific anti-phosphoantibodies. Based on results that showed that the DNA helicase activity of the MCM4-6-7 complex is negatively regulated by CDK2 phosphorylation, we suggest that the phosphorylation of MCM4 in the checkpoint control inhibits DNA replication, which includes blockage of DNA fork progression, through inactivation of the MCM complex.

The activation of the MCM complex requires phosphorylation of the MCM2 subunit by CDC7/DBF4 kinase and association of CDC45 with the origin region after the action of cyclin-dependent kinase. The MCM2-7 complex is the most likely candidate to act as the DNA replication helicase that catalyzes the unwinding of the DNA duplex during replication (4Aparicio O.M. Weinstein D.M. Bell S.P. Cell. 1997; 91: 59-69Google Scholar, 5Labib K. Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F. Science. 2000; 288: 1643-1647Google Scholar). Although all MCM subunits possess a DNA-dependent ATPase motif in their central domain, DNA helicase activity is detected only with the MCM4-6-7 complex, which dimerizes to form a hexamer (6Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Google Scholar, 7You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Google Scholar, 8Lee J.-K. Hurwitz J. J. Biol.

Thus, it is possible that the MCM4-6-7 hexamer is an activated form of the MCM (2Kelly T.J. Brown G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 829-880Google Scholar, 3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34833-34836Google Scholar). MCM4 is phosphorylated in vivo at least in part by cyclin-dependent kinases, which probably leads to the inactivation of the MCM complex (11Hendrickson M. Madine M. Dalton S. Gautier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12223-12228Google Scholar, 12Fujita M. Yamada C. Tsurumi T. Hanaoka F. Matsuzawa K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17095-17101Google Scholar). We reported previously (13Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34428-34433Google Scholar) that the DNA helicase activity of the MCM4-6-7 complex is inhibited by the site-specific phosphorylation of MCM4 with CDK2-cyclin A. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has been shown that cyclin-dependent kinases play a role leading to the exclusion of MCM4 from the nucleus (14Labib K. Diffley J.F. Kearsey S.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 415-422Google Scholar). Other targets of the cyclin-dependent kinase activity that contribute to the negative regulation of DNA replication include ORC, CDC6, and CDT1 (15Blow J.J. Hodgson B. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 72-78Google Scholar).Cells normally protect the integrity of their genome from stresses such as ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, alkylating reagents, and DNA replication blockage (16Zhou B.-B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Google Scholar, 17Rhind N. Russell P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3889-3896Google Scholar, 18Abraham R.T.

Treatment with hydroxyurea (HU), which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, not only blocks the progression of DNA replication but also activates a DNA replication checkpoint system that is required to maintain genomic integrity. In the presence of HU or methyl methanesulfonate, the initiation of DNA replication at late origins is prevented (22Santocanale C. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 1998; 395: 615-618Google Scholar, 23Shirahige K. Hori Y. Shiraishi K. Yamashita M. Takahashi K. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Yoshikawa H. Nature. 1998; 395: 618-621Google Scholar, 24Tercero J.A. Diffley J.F.X. Nature. 2001; 412: 553-557Google Scholar), and the arrested replication fork structure is maintained (25Lopes M. Cotta-Ramusino C. Pellicioli A. Liberi G. Plevani P. Muzi-Falconi M. Newlon C.S. Foiani M. Nature. 2001; 412: 557-561Google Scholar) by an active process that includes protein phosphorylation by the Mec1 and Rad53 kinases in S. cerevisiae. Recently, Sogo et al. (26Sogo J.M. Lopes M. Foiani M. Science. 2002; 297: 599-602Google Scholar) showed that the accumulation of single-stranded DNA and replication fork reversal occur at stalled replication forks in the absence of checkpoint control. It is plausible that these abnormal DNA structures lead to a loss of genome integrity. Mec1 with Rad3-1-1 kinases are known to be sensors of the arrested fork structure, and Rad53 is an effector kinase that is activated by its phosphorylation by Mec1. Several target proteins in the replication checkpoint pathway have been identified. Rad53 phosphorylates Dbf4 to attenuate the Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase activity (27Weinreich M. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5334-5346Google Scholar, 28Kihara M. Nakai W. Asano S. Suzuki A. Kitada K. Kawasaki Y. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35051-35062Google Scholar, 29Snaith H.A. Brown G.W. Forsburg S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7922-7932Google Scholar), and replication protein A, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein, is phosphorylated by Mec1 in an HU-dependent manner (30Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3725-3732Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of DNA polymerase α is also regulated in this system (31Pellicioli A. Lucca C. Liberi G. Marini F. Lopes M. Plevani P. Romano A. Di Fiore P.P. Foiani M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6561-6572Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether these targets are necessary and sufficient for the checkpoint reactions (32Jares P. Donaldson A. Blow J.J. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 319-322Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, ATR (Mec1 homolog), which binds to the arrested fork structure with other sensor proteins, phosphorylates CHK1, an effector kinase, leading to its activation (33Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Google Scholar, 34Feijoo C. Hall-Jackson C. Wu R. Jenkins D. Leitch J. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 913-923Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking CHK1 function show a progressive change in the global pattern of replication origin firing in the absence of any DNA replication (34Feijoo C. Hall-Jackson C. Wu R. Jenkins D. Leitch J. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 913-923Google Scholar). Target protein(s) in the replication checkpoint system remain to be identified.In this study we identified MCM4 as a target of the replication checkpoint system. The results suggest that the consecutive actions of ATR-CHK1 and CDK2 are required for the phosphorylation of MCM4. The phosphorylation of MCM4 should inhibit DNA replication through the inactivation of the MCM complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Caffeine, hydroxyurea, and 2-aminopurine were purchased from Sigma, and Gö6976 was from Calbiochem. Aphidicolin was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical. Antibodies against CHK1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biochemicals, and CDK2-Thr-160 phosphoantibodies were from Cell Signaling. λ-Phosphatase was from New England Biolabs. Anti-MCM4 antibodies were obtained as reported (35Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Google Scholar).Preparation of Cell Fractions and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed at 2 × 106 cells/100 μl in modified CSK buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm ATP, proteinase inhibitors (Pharmingen), and phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) (solution A) and placed on ice for 15 min. The cell suspension was centrifuged (5000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge), and the supernatant (S1) was saved. The recovered precipitate was suspended in solution A, and the supernatant obtained after centrifugation was saved (S2). The precipitate (P) was suspended in a volume of solution A to yield 4 × 106 cells/100 μl. In some experiments, the suspended P fractions were incubated with 1.4 units/μl of DNase I (Takara) for 15 min at 30 °C. The solution was centrifuged to obtain the soluble S4 fraction and the residual P′ fraction. The Triton-soluble (S1 and S2) and chromatin-bound (S4, P′, and P) fractions were electrophoresed through 10 (for MCM4 and CHK1) or 15% (for CDK2) acrylamide gels containing SDS and then transferred to membranes (Immobilon, Millipore). Membranes were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with primary antibodies in blocking solution (Blockace, Dai-nippon Pharmaceuticals) or 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.15 m NaCl) plus 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing with TBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100, membranes were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). The immunoreacted proteins were detected using a chemiluminescent detection system (Super-Signal West Pico or Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate, Pierce), and the level of reactivity was quantified (Cool Saver AE-6935, Atto Instruments).Preparation of Anti-phosphoantibodies—Antisera against phosphothreonine and phosphoserine at amino acids 7, 19, 32, 54, and 110 of human MCM4 were obtained by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide of NH2-MSSPAS(pT)PSRRGSRRGRAC-COOH (for aa 7), NH2-SRRGRA(pT)PAQTPRSEC-COOH (for aa 19), NH2-CRSEDARS-(pS)PSQRRRG-COOH (for aa 32), NH2-CELQPMPT(pS)PGVDLQS-COOH (for aa 54), or NH2-CGTPRSGVRG(pT)PVRQRPDL (for aa 110); the antibodies were conjugated with the keyhole limpet at each amino terminus. Anti-phosphoantibodies were purified by phosphopeptide column chromatography. After the serum (10 ml) was loaded onto a phosphopeptide column (2 ml) that had been prepared by fixing the above peptides to CNBr-activated Sepharose, antibodies were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5, and 0.15 m NaCl. Eluted fractions were neutralized, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and then passed through a non-phosphopeptide-Sepharose column (2 ml). The material that passed through the column was concentrated and used as the anti-phosphoantibodies described below.In Vitro Phosphorylation—Human CDK2-cyclin A complex was prepared as reported (13Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34428-34433Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged human CHK1 and CHK2 proteins were expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus expression system (36Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M.

Nakanishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31463-31467Google Scholar) and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Human MCM4 and -6 genes were cloned into a pAcUW31 vector (7You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Google Scholar), and the MCM7 gene was cloned into a pVL1392 vector for baculoviral expression. An MCM4-6-7 complex containing histidine-tagged MCM4 was purified from the viral infected High5 cells by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column chromatography and then MonoQ column chromatography. The human MCM4-6-7 complex (50 ng) was incubated with increasing levels of CHK1 (120 and 400 ng) in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 8, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP or incubated with CDK2-cyclin A (20, 60, and 200 ng) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures were incubated for1hat37 °C, and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS.Purification of MCM4-6-7 Complex from HeLa Cells—HeLa cells were cultured in the presence or absence of HU (2 mm) for 24 h. The harvested cells (∼1 × 108 cells) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then stored at –80 °C. After thawing, the cells were suspended in modified CSK buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors (10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride) in the absence of Triton X-100 and kept at 0 °C for 15 min. The cell precipitate recovered after centrifugation was then suspended in CSK buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.4 m NaCl, and phosphatase inhibitors and kept at 0 °C for 15 min. The recovered supernatant fraction contained about half the chromatin-bound MCM proteins. After centrifugation, the solubilized proteins were loaded onto a histone H3/H4 column (2 ml) that had been equilibrated with a buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl (6Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Google Scholar). The column was extensively washed with the same buffer, and proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0.3–2 m NaCl. The fractions containing MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins that were eluted with 0.6–0.9 m NaCl were pooled and concentrated with Centricon 30 (Amicon) in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture 1 plus 2 from Sigma) and protease inhibitors. During the concentration, the solution was diluted to 0.15 m NaCl. The diluted and concentrated sample was further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Fractions 3–6 of a total of 15 fractions were pooled and concentrated to 20 μl with Microcon (Amicon) after the addition of proteinase inhibitors. The concentrated sample, which contained ∼35 μg/ml proteins, was used for measuring the displacement of 17-mer oligonucleotide annealed to M13 single-stranded DNA by DNA helicase activity (6Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Google Scholar).Another procedure was employed to obtain total cell extracts in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. HeLa cells were washed with hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then homogenized with Dounce homogenizer (B pestle). Proteins extracted with 0.4 m NaCl in the same solution were loaded onto a histone H3/H4 column equilibrated with 0.3 m NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted by the linear gradient from 0.3 to 2 m NaCl. Fractions containing MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins were pooled and further purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation as described above, except that fractions obtained after glycerol gradient centrifugation were used without concentration for measuring DNA helicase activity.UV Irradiation of HeLa Cells—HeLa cells that were logarithmically growing in dishes (100 mm in diameter) were exposed to UV irradiation (100 J/m2) from a germicidal lamp (Toshiba GL15) at 2.5 J/m2 in the absence of growth medium. Fresh growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum) was added to the cells, and they were cultured at 37 °C for the indicated periods. Cells harvested after incubation with trypsin/EDTA solution were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stored at –80 °C before fractionation of the cells.RESULTSPhosphorylation of MCM4 in the Presence of HU—Logarithmically growing HeLa cells were cultured in the presence of HU for different periods (0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h). After lysis, cells were fractionated into Triton-soluble (S1 and S2) and Triton-insoluble chromatin-bound fractions (P). The proteins in these fractions were reacted with anti-MCM4 antibodies (Fig. 1A, top panel). MCM4 was detected in both the soluble (S1) and the insoluble chromatin-bound (P) fractions isolated from cells cultured in the absence of HU. A portion of the MCM4 with slightly retarded mobility was detected in the P fraction. During incubation in the presence of HU, the level of MCM4 in the P fraction with retarded mobility gradually increased with maximal retardation observed after 16 h. In contrast, the mobility of the MCM4 in the S1 fraction did not change during the 24 h of incubation in the presence of HU. The alteration in the mobility of MCM4 appeared to be due to its phosphorylation because after λ-phosphatase treatment it migrated to a position identical to that observed for the MCM4 isolated from the S1 fraction (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation of CHK1 was examined during incubation of cells with HU (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Retardation of its mobility, which is due to phosphorylation by ATR (34Feijoo C. Hall-Jackson C. Wu R. Jenkins D. Leitch J. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 913-923Google Scholar), was detected over a time course similar to that observed for the hyperphosphorylation of MCM4. It remains to be determined why the total amount of CHK1 protein decreases after 24 h of incubation with HU.Checkpoint-dependent Phosphorylation of MCM4 —To address the question of whether the observed phosphorylation of MCM4 is due to the action of the DNA replication checkpoint system, caffeine, an inhibitor of ATR/ATM, which plays a central role in the checkpoint system, was added to the growth medium containing HU. As shown in Fig. 2 (top panel), this addition markedly reduced the hyperphosphorylation of MCM4 isolated from the P fraction. The reduced level of hyperphosphorylated MCM4 in the presence of caffeine appears to be associated with the dephosphorylation of CHK1 protein, which is evident from the mobility shift of retarded CHK1 to the basal position (Fig. 2, middle panel). To clarify the role played by CHK1 kinase in the hyperphosphorylation of MCM4, Gö6976, an inhibitor of CHK1 kinase (38Kohn E.A. Yoo C.J. Eastman A. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 31-35Google Scholar) but not CDK2 kinase or CHK2 kinase activity (Fig. 3, A and B), was added to the medium containing HU. The drug inhibited the hyperphosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C, top panel). At a concentration of 600 nm, hyperphosphorylation of MCM4 was largely prevented, whereas phosphorylation of CHK1 protein itself was unaffected by Gö6976 (Fig. 3C, middle panel), indicating that this drug does not affect ATR kinase activity. These findings suggest that an ATR-CHK1 pathway is involved in the hyperphosphorylation of MCM4.Fig. 2Caffeine blocks HU-induced hyperphosphorylation of MCM4. HeLa cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of 2 mm HU and 5 mm caffeine as indicated. Triton-soluble fraction (S1) and the chromatin fraction (P)(8 μl each) were examined for MCM4 (top panel), CHK1 (middle panel), and CDK2-Thr-160 phosphorylation (bottom panel) by immunoblotting analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 3Influence of Gö6976 on the in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of key proteins.A, in vitro effects of Gö6976 on the phosphorylation of CDC25c and MCM4.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Google Scholar) was phosphorylated with human CHK1 (200 ng) (left panel) or human CHK2 (150 ng) (right panel) in the absence or presence of increasing levels of Gö6976 under the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Human MCM2-4-6-7 (90 ng) prepared from HeLa cells was incubated with CDK2-cyclin A (35 ng) under the same conditions (middle panel). Proteins were analyzed on 15–25% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS followed by autoradiography. The positions of phosphorylated GST-CDC25c, CHK1, CHK2, cyclin A, MCM2 and -4 are indicated. Reactions with kinases as substrates were electrophoresed in the left-hand lanes of each gel. B, quantification of the inhibitory effect of Gö6976 on the phosphorylation of GST-CDC25c by CHK1 (Xes), CHK2 (open circles), and the phosphorylation of MCM2 and -4 by CDK2-cyclin A (filled circles). Radioactivity incorporated into each substrate in the absence of Gö6976 was taken as 100%. C, in vivo effect of Gö6976. HeLa cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of HU and increasing concentrations of Gö6976. Specific fractions prepared from the treated HeLa cells, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” were examined for MCM4 (P fraction only, top), CHK1 (S1 only, middle), and CDK2-Thr-160 (S1 and S2, bottom) phosphorylation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Involvement of Cyclin-dependent Kinase in MCM4 Phosphorylation—In the presence of HU, ATR kinase phosphorylates CHK1 kinase, an effector kinase in the checkpoint system, to activate it in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A) (34Feijoo C. Hall-Jackson C. Wu R. Jenkins D. Leitch J. Gilbert D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 913-923Google Scholar). To identify the kinase responsible for MCM4 hyperphosphorylation in the presence of HU, we first phosphorylated the human MCM4-6-7 complex with a human CHK1 kinase preparation in vitro. Both MCM4 and -6 proteins in the complex appeared to be phosphorylated (Fig. 4A, right panel), but phosphorylation with CHK1 did not lead to the generation of highly phosphorylated forms of MCM4 (Fig. 4B, 1st column on the left panel). In contrast, MCM4 products with retarded mobility were generated by phosphorylation with CDK2-cyclin A (Fig. 4, A, left panel, and B, 1st column on the left panel). We reported previously (39Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. You Z. Omori A. Kitagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16235-16241Google Scholar) that mouse MCM4 in an MCM4-6-7 complex was extensively phosphorylated with CDK2-cyclin A and that this phosphorylation inhibited the DNA helicase activity of the complex. Phosphorylation in this system of mutant mouse MCM4-6-7 complexes, where amino acids of MCM4 were altered in a site-specific manner, indicated that six sites (Ser-3, Thr-7, Thr-19, Ser-32, Ser-53, and Thr-109) in the amino-terminal region of mouse MCM4 were required for the phosphorylation of MCM4 (13Ishimi Y. Komamura-Kohno Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34428-34433Google Scholar). Specific phosphoantibodies against three (Ser-32, Ser-54, and Thr-110) of these sites in human MCM4 were raised, and they were examined for binding to the phosphorylated MCM4 (Fig. 4B). They interacted with the MCM4-phosphorylated product formed with CDK2-cyclin A but not with the phosphorylated MCM4 product formed with CHK1 (Fig. 4B, 2nd to 4th columns on the left panel). Next, we examined the interaction of these phosphoantibodies with MCM4-hyperphosphorylated products produced in the presence of HU (Fig. 4B, 2nd to 4th columns on the right panel). These phosphoantibodies recognized the hyperphosphorylated MCM4 products that were isolated from the chromatin fractions (S4 and P′) of HU-treated HeLa cells. Quantification of the level of binding of these phosphoantibodies indicates that phosphorylation of MCM4 in the chromatin fractions increased by 2.5–6-fold in the presence of HU. These results strongly suggest that cyclin-dependent kinase activity is involved directly in the HU-induced hyperphosphorylation of MCM4.Fig. 4Phosphorylation of MCM4 by cyclin-dependent kinase.A, human MCM4-6-7 complex (50 ng) was incubated with increasing amounts of CDK2-cyclin A (left panel) or CHK1 (right panel). Phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis on 10% polyacrylamide gel, followed by autoradiography. The maximal level of 32P incorporated into MCM4 by CDK2 was 2.3 mol/mol of MCM4 and that of 32P incorporated into MCM4 + MCM6 by CHK1 was 4 mol/mol of MCM4 + MCM6. B, left panel, human MCM4-6-7 complex was phosphorylated by CHK1 or CDK2-cyclin A in vitro, and products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using MCM4 antibodies (1st column) and phosphoantibodies against amino acids Ser-32, Ser-54, and Thr-110 of MCM4 (2nd to 4th columns), as indicated. Right panel, the soluble (S1) and chromatin-bound fractions (S4 and P′) prepared from HeLa cells treated with HU were analyzed by Western blotting using MCM4 and the anti-phosphoantibodies. Bars at the left of gels indicate the normal position of unphosphorylated MCM4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To gain more insight on the mechanism by which MCM4 is hyperphosphorylated by a cyclin-dependent kinase, we monitored the activation of CDK2 by examining its phosphorylation at Thr-160 (40Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Google Scholar) during the incubation of HeLa cells with HU (Fig. 1A, bottom panel). Phosphorylation of Thr-160 increased 2–3-fold after 16 and 24 h of the incubation with HU. The addition of caffeine (Fig. 2, bottom panel) or Gö6976 (Fig. 3C, bottom panel) decreased the level of phosphorylated CDK2 produced in the presence of HU. These results indicate that the activation of CDK2 kinase activity correlates with the increased level of MCM4 hyperphosphorylation induced by HU.Functional Significance of Phosphorylation of MCM4 —To understand the functional significance of phosphorylation of MCM4, DNA helicase activity was compared between MCM4-6-7 complexes prepared from HU-treated and non-treated HeLa cells. After extraction of a large portion of the soluble forms of the MCM complex, approximately half the chromatin-bound MCM complex was recovered by extraction of the remaining insoluble fraction with a buffer containing 0.4 m NaCl (data not shown). The MCM4-6-7 complex was purified from the 0.4 m NaCl-soluble fraction of HU-treated HeLa cells and non-treated cells in the presence phosphatase inhibitors, and it was also purified from total cell extracts of non-treated cells in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 5A, these three MCM4-6-7 complexes exhibited similar protein compositions and concentration, although only a slight amount of MCM2 was detectable in the complexes prepared from HU-treated cells in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors and from non-treated cells in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. Two MCM4 bands that migrated closely on a gel were detected from the complex prepared from non-treated cells in the absence or presence of phosphatase inhibitors, although the ratio of these two bands varied between the two complexes. Only one MCM4 band with retarded mobil"

This cyclical growth of hair is regulated by a diversity of growth factors. Although normal expression of both epidermal growth factor and its receptor (EGFR) in the outer root sheath is down-regulated with the completion of follicular growth, here we show that continuous expression of epidermal growth factor in hair follicles of transgenic mice arrested follicular development at the final stage of morphogenesis. Data from immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting showed that epidermal growth factor signals through EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers in skin. Furthermore, topical application of tyrphostin AG1478 or AG825, specific inhibitors of EGFR and ErbB2, respectively, completely inhibited new hair growth in wild type mice but not in transgenic mice. When the transgenic mice were crossed with waved-2 mice, which possess a lower kinase activity of EGFR, the hair phenotype was rescued in the offspring. Taken together, these data suggest that EGFR signaling is indispensable for the initiation of hair growth. On the other hand, continuous expression of epidermal growth factor prevents entry into the catagen phase. We propose that epidermal growth factor functions as a biologic switch that is turned on and off in hair follicles at the beginning and end of the anagen phase of the hair cycle, guarding the entry to and exit from the anagen phase.

We propose that epidermal growth factor functions as a biologic switch that is turned on and off in hair follicles at the beginning and end of the anagen phase of the hair cycle, guarding the entry to and exit from the anagen phase. The hair follicle is a regenerating system that undergoes cycles of renewal in three phases known as anagen, catagen, and telogen. Various signaling molecules are involved in different phases of hair growth (1Stenn K.S. Paus R. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 449-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying the switch from phase to phase remain largely unknown. Among the many growth factors expressed in association with the development of hair follicles, epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; TGF-α, transforming growth factor-α; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; H&E, hematoxylin and eosin. is known for its effects on skin and hair development (2Cohen S. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Subcutaneous administration of EGF for 2 weeks into neonatal mice delayed the development of hair follicles and epidermis. Both the growth of hair bulbs and hair fiber production were retarded. The proliferative activity of the epidermis at birth was maintained for 8 days, resulting in a thicker epidermis compared with control mice. However, the delay in skin development was not prolonged, and the mitotic index and thickness of the epidermis declined to that of control values a few days later. By Day 41, final hair length and diameter were not significantly reduced (3Moore G.P.M. Panaretto B.A. Robertson D. Anat. Rec. 1983; 205: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). EGF also had no effect on back skin when injected into mice with ages ranging from 12 to 20 days (2Cohen S. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 1017-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The authors suggested that EGF was only active in skin during the neonatal period (3Moore G.P.M. Panaretto B.A. Robertson D. Anat. Rec. 1983; 205: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In contrast, EGF induces follicle regression besides inhibiting hair fiber production and stimulating mitosis of the basal epidermal cells when infused into adult sheep (4Moore G.P. Panaretto B.A. Carter N.B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 84: 172-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Subsequently, in vitro studies with isolated human hair follicles have shown that EGF stimulates DNA synthesis in the outer root sheath and hair follicle elongation but inhibits hair fiber production. DNA synthesis in the matrix cells is inhibited, and they remain connected to the dermal papilla by a thin strand of epithelial cells, inducing an artificial catagen-like effect (5Philpott M.P. Kealey T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 186-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Despite all these early studies, the physiological role of EGF on hair development and the signaling pathways involved remain unclear. It has been shown that administration of anti-EGF serum can cause accelerated hair growth in newborn mice (6Zschiesche W. Eckert K. Experientia (Basel). 1988; 44: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This suggests that endogenous EGF acts as an inhibitory molecule during follicle morphogenesis. There are four members of the EGF receptor family namely EGFR or ErbB1, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. EGF, transforming growth factor (TGF)-α, amphiregulin, and possibly epigen (7Strachan L. Murison J.G.

Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (5670) Google Scholar). A null mutation in Egfr is lethal during embryonic development. Only certain strains of mutant mice can survive up to 3 weeks after birth, with severe impairment in development of multiple organs including skin and failure of hair growth (9Miettinen P.J.

In transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative mutant of EGFR in the epidermis and outer root sheath, the hair follicles cannot progress through follicle morphogenesis and eventually undergo necrosis (13Murillas R.

Irregularly distributed hair follicles were found in the dermis and subcutis layers. Surprisingly, triple null mice lacking EGF, amphiregulin, and TGF-α demonstrate the same hair and skin phenotype as the TGF-α null mice (18Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Fenton S.E. Troyer K.L. Riedel R.F. Chang A. Lee D.C. Development. 1999; 126: 2739-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that other members of the EGF family can compensate for the loss of the three EGFR ligands. Transgenic mice overexpressing the various EGFR ligands in skin are useful for addressing their specific roles. Both amphiregulin and heparin-binding EGF are expressed in skin (19Piepkorn M. Underwood R.A. Henneman C. Smith L.T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 802-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20Downing M.T. Brigstock D.R. Luquette M.H. Crissman-Combs M.

Upon culture of keratinocytes, the expression of both molecules increases, and they become the major autocrine factors for proliferation (21Piepkorn M. Pittelkow M.R. Cook P.W. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 715-721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, trauma can lead to metalloproteinase-mediated cleavage of amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF, and TGF-α from their transmembrane precursors. The evidence suggests that ectodomain shedding of these growth factors is required for wound healing (22Tokumaru S. Higashiyama S. Endo T. Nakagawa T. Miyagawa J.I. Yamamori K. Hanakawa Y. Ohmoto H.

These three EGFR ligands are probably more important in wound healing and in skin pathology. Overexpression of amphiregulin in transgenic mice induces an epidermal hyperproliferation and inflammation, which is similar to psoriasis, and is in agreement with the increased expression of this moiety in psoriasis patients. TGF-α is expressed in the inner (14Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H. Peiffer R.L. Oliver P. Smithies O. Lee D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 263-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar) and outer root sheath (24Nixon A.J. Broad L. Saywell D.P. Pearson A.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 337-387Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) in actively growing follicles. TGF-α transgenic mice have been reported to exhibit a thicker epidermis and stunted hair growth, but the epidermal scaliness disappeared, and hair growth was partially restored at 5–6 weeks despite a persistent expression of the transgene. Benign skin papillomas were found in older animals. EGF is also expressed in the outer root sheath in the growing hair follicles (25du Cros D.L. Isaacs K. Moore G.P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 109-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), although the role of EGF in hair biology has not been clarified using the transgenic approach. For this purpose we have generated and analyzed a transgenic mouse line constitutively expressing EGF in skin and hair follicles. Our data suggest a specific role for EGF in the control of the hair cycle. Animals—Mice were cared for in the Laboratory Animal Unit at the University of Hong Kong. Waved-2 mice bred with a mixed C57BL/6 and 129/sv background were a generous gift from Dr. Ashley Dunn (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia). Waved-2 mice have a hypomorphic allele of Egfr that contains a point mutation near the tyrosine kinase domain (16Fowler K.J. Walker F. Alexander W. Hibbs M.L. Nice E.C. Bohmer R.M. Mann G.B. Thumwood C. Maglitto R. Danks J.A. Chetty R. Burgess A.W. Dunn A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1465-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 17Luetteke N.C. Phillips H.K.

Generation of Transgenic Mice—The full-length mouse Egf cDNA of 4.6 kb was isolated from a C57BL/6 kidney cDNA library (Invitrogen) and confirmed by sequencing. EGF transgenic mice were established using the promoter from cytomegalovirus to drive full-length Egf cDNA joined to an SV40 poly(A). The injection fragment of 6.5 kb was released and purified using the QIAEX gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and then passed through a spin-X column (Costar). The purified DNA fragment was introduced at 6–8 ng/μl into the pronucleus of FVB/N embryos by standard microinjection procedures (26Hogan B. Beddington R. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 232-248Google Scholar). Transgenic mice were identified by PCR of tail DNA using primers for Egf cDNA and confirmed by Southern blotting (data not shown). The primer sequences (5′ to 3′) were gagaatgccgcctgcaccaacac and agggttctttggggggtttgatag, giving a PCR product of 435 bp. Immunohistochemistry—The locations of EGF expression on dorsal skin in heterozygous animals were determined at birth (Day 1), Days 4, 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 28, 35, 40, and 50. After the first hair cycle, hair growth was asynchronized in wild type animals, and therefore no further time points were examined. Skin samples were orientated and snap-frozen using the Hofmann technique (27Paus R. Hofmann U. Eichmüller S. Czarnetzki B.M. Br. J. Dermatol. 1994; 130: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Cryosections (10 μm) were stored at -70 °C and equilibrated to room temperature before use. The sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed, and then treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide, washed thoroughly with distilled water, and then washed again with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.4. After incubation with 10% normal goat serum, 3.33 μg/ml rabbit antimouse EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was applied overnight at 4 °C. Then the sections were washed with TBS and incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (Dako, UK) diluted 1 in 100 for 1 h. The sections were washed with TBS and incubated with streptavidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (Dako) for 30 min. The sections were washed again and incubated for 5 min with a 1 mg/ml chromogen solution (Dako). After counterstaining with hematoxylin, the sections were dehydrated and mounted with Permount. As negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted or replaced with the same concentration of rabbit IgG (Dako). To confirm signal specificity, the primary antibody was blocked with 15 μg/ml mouse EGF (PeproTech, Israel) at 4 °C overnight before use. Terminal dUTP Nick-end Labeling Assay—The procedures recommended for the Apoptosis Detection kit (Promega) were followed on fixed frozen skin sections. Measurement of Skin Thickness—Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on frozen sections (three heterozygous mice per time point, with control mice from nontransgenic littermates). Three representative sections for each sample were analyzed using a Leica DMRB microscope. The thickness of epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers was measured on digital images using the Stereo Investigator 4.0 software (Leica Ltd., Germany). A total of 50 data sets were collected from the three samples at each time point. All data were reported as mean ± S.D. and analyzed using the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. Protein Preparation and Immunoblotting—Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and mid-dorsal skin, liver, and brain were immediately collected for protein preparation. Tissues were homogenized in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin. The homogenized samples were centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min, and the supernatants were collected. Samples (80-μg aliquots as determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding assay; Bio-Rad) were separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Hybond-ECL membrane (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoblotting, the procedures in the chemiluminescent detection system (ECL Detection System; Amersham Biosciences) were followed. The primary antibodies and working concentrations are as follows: rabbit anti-mouse EGF (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., 2 μg/ml); mouse anti-human EGFR (Transduction Laboratories, 1 μg/ml); rabbit anti-mouse ErbB2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 0.2 μg/ml); rabbit anti-mouse ErbB3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 0.2 μg/ml); and mouse anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, 1 μg/ml). The secondary antibodies and working dilutions are as follows: goat anti-mouse IgG (Transduction Laboratories, 1:5000) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences, 1:4000). Immunoprecipitation—Specific antibody (1 μg) was added to 500 μg of crude protein samples, and the mixture was made up to a final volume of 0.5 ml with IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm Na3VO4, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rocking. Protein A- or G-agarose (40 μl) was then added, and incubation was continued for 2 h. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were discarded. The agarose beads were washed with 1 ml of IP buffer at 4 °C for 5 min. The samples were spun down and the washing procedures repeated 3 more times. Finally, 40 μl of sample buffer with 5% β-mercaptoethanol were added to the agarose beads and the samples used for immunoblotting. Topical Application of the ErbB1 Inhibitor AG1478 and ErbB2 Inhibitor AG825—Heterozygous transgenic mice (Day 23, n = 4) and nontransgenic littermates (n = 4) were each divided into two groups of treatment and control animals. Tyrphostin AG1478 (10 μg, Sigma) or tyrphostin AG825 (60 μg, Sigma) was dissolved in 1 ml of Me2SO and then mixed with 2 g of a neutral aqueous cream base (Orjon, Australia). An area starting midway along the back of the mice was shaved 1 day before application of the inhibitor or cream base. AG1478 or AG825 cream was applied topically every day for 15 consecutive days. In the case of the controls, only the cream base was administered. Each treatment was repeated on three litters (n = 8). For large litters of more than 8 mice, 10 μg of AG1478 together with 60 μg of AG825 were added to 1 ml of Me2SO, mixed with 2 g of cream, and applied to the rest of the litter. Characterization of EGF Transgenic Mice—Although seven transgenic lines were generated with the CMV-Egf construct, only one line, designated 62.7, manifested phenotypic changes, and the heterozygous animals were used for detailed analysis here. Line 62.7 exhibited thin hair, curly vibrissae, and stunted growth (Fig. 1, a and b). Homozygous bred transgenic mice showed an even more severe phenotype and appeared to be nearly nude. When bred into different genetic backgrounds, including C57BL/6, ICR, F1 hybrid of C57BL/6 and FVB, transgenic progeny showed similar hair phenotype as the FVB founder (not shown). From immunohistochemistry, EGF was expressed in the sebaceous glands, outer root sheath of hair follicles, stratum granulosum, and basal keratinocytes of the epidermis during follicular morphogenesis in wild type mice (Fig. 1, c and d). The EGF expression in hair follicles was switched off once they had entered the telogen phase (Fig. 1e). In contrast, transgenic mice demonstrated constitutive expression of EGF in the hair follicles (Fig. 1, f–h) which appeared to remain in stage 7–8 of follicular morphogenesis according to published guidelines by Paus et al. (28Paus R. Müller-Röver S. van der Veen C. Maurer M. Eichmüller S. Ling G. Hofmann U. Foitzik K. Mecklenburg L. Handjiski B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Results from reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunoblotting confirmed that EGF was strongly expressed in the skin of 62.7 mice with accumulation of the EGF precursor, which was in contrast to age-matched wild type mice (Fig. 1i). EGF protein could also be detected in the liver and brain of transgenic animals, and this subtle phenotype is still under investigation. Only increased levels of EGF mRNA, but not of protein, were detected in other transgenic lines that correlated with the absence of abnormalities in the skin or other organs at the morphological or histological level. Association of EGF Expression with Structural Changes in the Skin and Hair Cycling—From H&E-stained sections (Fig. 2), wild type mice and transgenic mice had the same skin histology at birth (Day 1, Fig. 2, a and b). However, at Day 4, retardation of hair follicle and skin development was observed in the transgenic mice (Fig. 2, c and d). Although more than 90% of hair follicles had grown into the subcutis layer (stages 7 and 8), an increase in hair follicle size and total skin thickness was obvious in the wild type mice only. Furthermore, transgenic skin samples showed a thicker epidermis when compared with wild type animals at Day 4. There was an increase in the number of cell layers at the basal layer as well as the stratum corneum, which suggested epidermal hyperproliferation and a delay in epidermal differentiation (Fig. 2, c and d, insets). The hair follicles in wild type animals were in the dermis layer as the hair cycle proceeded to the catagen/telogen phase at Day 21 (Fig. 2e). They were in the first anagen at Day 28 and already at telogen by Day 35. The duration of first anagen was much shorter than that reported for C57BL/6 (29Müller-Röver S. Handjiski B. van der Veen C. Eichmüller S. Foitzik K. McKay I.A. Steen K.S. Paus R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 3-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For transgenic animals, hair follicles were found in the subcutis layer when sampled at Days 7, 10, 14, 17, 21, 28, 35, and 40, and no hair follicles of catagen or telogen phase were observed at any of these time points. Furthermore, no apoptotic cells were detected in either the lower bulb or the root sheath of transgenic follicles by terminal dUTP nick-end labeling staining at any of the time points studied (not shown). This has been used to distinguish the late anagen follicles from those in early catagen (1Stenn K.S. Paus R. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 449-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). At Day 50, some telogen follicles could be occasionally found in certain transgenic animals. Skin thickness was measured using computer-assisted morphometric software (Fig. 3a). In general, total skin thickness in transgenic samples was less than in controls from newborn to around Day 14 after birth (p < 0.05). However, as total skin thickness decreased in wild type mice when progressing through the hair cycle, transgenic skin became thicker than that of controls (p < 0.05). The reduced skin thickness in transgenic mice in the first 14 days was mainly contributed by the subcutis (Fig. 3d) (p < 0.05). In contrast, the increase in thickness observed after Day 21 involved the epidermis, the dermis, and the subcutis layers (Fig. 3, b–d). Furthermore, the hair shaft diameter of hair plugged from back skin was only half that of controls, although the percentage of various types of hair did not change (not shown).Fig. 3Analysis of skin thickness throughout the hair cycle. The thickness at each stage was measured for total skin (a), epidermis (b), dermis (c), and subcutis (d). A reduced total skin thickness was observed for transgenic mice from birth to Day 14 (p < 0.05). This phenomenon reversed from Day 21 onward with thicker skin in the transgenic mice (p < 0.05). The reduction in skin thickness in the first 14 days was contributed mainly by the subcutis layer (p < 0.05). The increase in skin thickness of transgenic mice after Day 21 was contributed by all three layers (p < 0.05). The asterisk represents a significant difference using Student's t test. The thickness of skin samples from normal mice oscillated according to the different phases of the hair growth. In contrast, transgenic skin only showed small changes in skin thickness. Values shown are means ± 1 S.D. and n = 50.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) EGFR Signaling in Hair Development as Revealed by Immunoblotting—Next, we investigated the pathway of EGF signaling in wild type and transgenic skin. EGFR was readily detected in crude skin lysates of both transgenic and wild type mice at Day 7 and Day 14 (Fig. 4a). The receptors were strongly phosphorylated during this period, which suggested that there was activation of downstream pathways for hair growth. However, at Day 21, when hair follicles were at the telogen phase in normal mice, the expression of EGFR was down-regulated in both transgenic and wild type mice, although transgenic skin samples indicated a comparatively higher EGFR expression and stronger phosphorylation than samples from age-matched wild type animals. By Day 35, when all hair follicles were again at telogen phase in the wild type mice, the expression of EGFR was barely detectable in both wild type mice and transgenic mice. In order to determine the involvement of other EGFR family members, immunoblotting of ErbB2 and ErbB3 was performed. ErbB4 receptors were excluded since they were not detected in the skin by immunohistochemistry (30Xian W. Rosenberg M.P. DiGiovanni J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For ErbB2, expression was high in both transgenic and wild type skin at Day 7. However, expression persisted at Day 35 in transgenic mice only and was not observed in wild type animals. Similar results were obtained for ErbB3 expression. After relating the expression of various ErbB receptors to follicle morphogenesis and the hair cycle, we attempted to identify the dimerization partner(s) of ErbB1 by immunoprecipitation using antibodies specific for either ErbB2 or ErbB3 (Fig. 4b). For Day 14 samples, both ErbB2 and ErbB3 immunoprecipitates were phosphorylated at a comparable level in both transgenic and wild type skin samples. EGFR could be detected in both immunoprecipitates, implying EGFR/ErbB2 and EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimer formation in Day 14 skin samples. In contrast, for Day 35 skin, ErbB2 activation was detected in transgenic but not in wild type mice, and EGFR could be detected in ErbB2 immunoprecipitates. Neither ErbB3 activation nor EGFR/ErbB3 heterodimerization was detected in transgenic or wild type samples at Day 35. Because ErbB2 has no known ligand and requires a dimerization partner for phosphorylation, we conclude that ErbB2 activation persisted in the transgenic skin through heterodimerization with EGFR. Topical Application of ErbB Blockers—Our data suggested that EGF signaling through EGFR/ErbB2 and EGFR/ErbB3 may be important in follicle growth and perhaps during the anagen phase of the hair cycle. We tested this hypothesis in vivo using control and transgenic mice. Either tyrphostin AG1478 or AG825, selective inhibitors of EGFR and ErbB2 tyrosine kinase activity, respectively, was administered to the skin of adult mice. An area on the dorsal side was shaved 1 day before the first inhibitor application (Fig. 5, a and b). Shaving could induce anagen (31Ogawa H. Hattori M. Curr. Probl. Dermatol. (Basel). 1983; 11: 159-170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and allow easy assessment of hair growth. After 15 consecutive days of treatment, wild type mice treated with vehicle only had a new layer of hair (Fig. 5e), whereas in wild type mice treated with either inhibitor, new hair growth was completely inhibited (Fig. 5c). Skin histology after treatment showed that hair follicles were in the anagen phase of the hair cycle (not shown). In contrast, tyrphostin-treated transgenic mice showed continuous hair growth (Fig. 5d), although less dense hair was observed compared with the vehicle-treated transgenic mice (Fig. 5f). Similar results were obtained when both inhibitors were applied simultaneously, and there was a more obvious reduction in hair density. Furthermore, new hair growth in the transgenic mice treated with both inhibitors was 2 days slower than that of transgenic mice treated with a single inhibitor. Within the vehicle-treated group, new hair growth in wild type mice was slower than in transgenic mice by 2 days. These data suggest that EGFR/ErbB2 signaling is indispensable for hair growth.

The InsP3R is widely distributed in metazoans and plays a key role in diverse physiological functions. In mammals, three different InsP3R isoforms are expressed; each is encoded by a distinct gene. The three isoforms are homologous and share ∼70% amino acid identity. Functional channels are composed of four subunits that tetramerize via determinants localized within the transmembrane regions and the cytosolic C terminus (1Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J.

Individual cell types often express more than one isoform, which may be present as homo- or heterotetrameric populations. The most characterized type 1 InsP3R (InsP3R1) forms largely homotetramers in cerebellum with Mr of 313,000 (2749 residues) for the monomer. Based on biochemical, molecular biological, and electrophysiological studies, each monomer subunit of the InsP3R1 is organized into three principal functional regions: an N-terminal InsP3-binding region (residues 226–578), a central (∼1,700-residue) modulatory/coupling region, and a channel-forming region near the C terminus. The channel region contains six transmembrane segments interspersed within residues 2276–2590 that are critical for membrane targeting, oligomerization, and formation of the ion permeation pathway (1Galvan D.L.

Thus, both ends, the large N-terminal region (residues 1–2275) and the C-terminal region (residues 2590–2749), are exposed to the cytoplasm. Electron micrographs of the negatively stained detergent-solubilized InsP3R1 and freeze-fracture deep etching electron microscopy of endoplasmic reticulum have been used to characterize the morphology of the InsP3R1 channel (5Chadwick C.C.

EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). But the three-dimensional shape and dimensions of the channel particles were not determined. Two three-dimensional maps of the InsP3R1 were reported recently based on single-particle reconstruction from specimens prepared by ice embedding (7Jiang Q.X. Thrower E.C. Chester D.W. Ehrlich B.E. Sigworth F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3575-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and negative staining (8Da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

In this study, we present a 30-Å three-dimensional structure of the InsP3R1 determined by electron cryomicroscopy and single-particle reconstruction. Purification of Bovine Type 1 InsP3R—Bovine cerebellar microsomal membranes were prepared as described previously (9Mignery G.A. Newton C.L. Archer III, B.T. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12679-12685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 μm pepstatin (Buffer A) with 1.7% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. The solubilized microsomal protein was combined with immunoaffinity matrix prepared by conjugating a type 1 C-terminal (T1C) antibody to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) and equilibrated in Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 (10Ramos-Franco J. Caenepeel S. Fill M. Mignery G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2783-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The affinity matrix with bound InsP3R1 was washed with two alternating series of Buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 and either 150 or 500 mm NaCl. A final wash was made with Buffer A containing 0.15% Triton X-100. InsP3R1 was eluted from the resin with 25 μm T1C immunogenic peptide (the 19 C-terminal amino acid residues of the rat type 1 InsP3R) in Buffer A. The sample was concentrated using a Vivaspin 6 concentrator (Vivascience Ltd., Binbrook, UK) and clarified of potential protein aggregates by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × gav. Sucrose was added to the InsP3R1 sample to a final concentration of 5%. The purified protein was aliquoted and stored at–80 °C. Biochemical and Functional Characterization of the Purified InsP3R1—Immunopurified InsP3R1 protein was resolved by 5% SDS-PAGE and evaluated by silver staining and immunoblotting with the T1C antibody as described previously (11Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes containing immunopurified receptor were prepared by exchanging the detergent with 0.9% CHAPS by sedimentation over 5–20% sucrose density gradients followed by our dialysis reconstitution protocol (12Perez P.J.

Electrophysiological characterization of the purified receptor using planar lipid bilayers was performed essentially as described previously (10Ramos-Franco J. Caenepeel S. Fill M. Mignery G.

Lipid bilayer-forming solution contained a 7:3 mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine in decane (Avanti Polar Lipids, Pelham, AL). Proteoliposomes containing immunopure InsP3R type 1 or InsP3RGE were added to the cis side (the cytosolic side of the ER) of the bilayer. The trans side (the lumenal side of the ER) of the bilayer was held to virtual ground. Standard solutions contained 220 mm CsCH3SO3 cis and 20 mm CsCH3SO3 trans,20mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA and CaCl2 ([Ca2+]free = 250 nm).

Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 93-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Channel sidedness was determined by the sensitivity to InsP3. Heparin (50 μg/ml, Sigma) was used to inhibit the channel. Unitary currents were recorded using a conventional patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The current signal was digitized at 5–10 kHz with a 32-bit analog to digital/digital to analog converter (Digidata 1322A, Axon Instruments) and filtered at 1 kHz. Unitary current measurement and data processing were performed using commercially available software packages (pClamp version 8.1, Axon Instruments and Origin, Microcal). Electron Cryomicroscopy—The vitrified samples of the purified InsP3R1 were prepared as described previously (15Serysheva I.I. Orlova E.V. Chiu W. Sherman M.B. Hamilton S.L. van Heel M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16Serysheva I.I. Ludtke S.J. Baker M.R. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10370-10375Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and transferred using a GATAN cryoholder into a JEOL1200 electron microscope operated at 100-kV accelerating voltage. Images of InsP3R1 particles were recorded on Eastman Kodak Co. SO163 film under low dose conditions (∼10 electrons/Å2) at a magnification of ×40,000 and at the defocus range of 1.8–3.5 μm underfocus. Three-dimensional Reconstruction of InsP3R—Micrographs were digitized using a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a final digitized pixel size of 3.5. ∼9,500 individual particle images were selected manually, and the contrast transfer function (CTF) was determined using EMAN (17Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 18Ludtke S.J. Jakana J. Song J. Chuang D.T. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 241-250Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The initial three-dimensional model produced by either EMAN or IMAGIC (19van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar) yielded the same overall shape. The final structure was refined from the initial model using a novel procedure. In brief, the overall refinement methodology is the same as a typical EMAN refinement: projection-based particle classification followed by generating a CTF-corrected average for each class and then constructing a new three-dimensional model from the class averages. The difference in the new procedure is the method of projection-matching technique for classification. The validity of this new methodology was confirmed by yielding an identical structure from lower contrast images of the Ca2+ release channel as determined previously (20Baker M.L. Serysheva I.I. Sencer S. Wu Y. Ludtke S.J. Jiang W. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12155-12160Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Resolution was determined to be ∼30 Å based on the 0.5 criterion in Fourier shell correlation of two independent reconstructions. No tilt experiments were performed, so the absolute handedness of the model is undetermined. Docking of X-ray Structure of InsP3-binding Domain—A density map of InsP3-binding domain at 30-Å resolution was generated from its x-ray structure, Protein Data Bank code 1N4K (21Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), using EMAN (17Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). FOLDHUNTER (22Jiang W. Baker M.L. Ludtke S.J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) was used to dock the crystal structure of the InsP3-binding domain into the cryomicroscopy reconstruction. Visualization of the fitting was done using IRIS EXPLORER (NAG, Downers Grove, IL) and CHIMERA (23Huang C.C. Couch G.S. Pettersen E.F. Ferrin T.E. Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 1996; 1: 724Google Scholar). Biochemical Purity and Functional Integrity of the Purified InsP3R1—The InsP3R1 was detergent-solubilized and purified to homogeneity by a one-step procedure using immunoaffinity chromatography. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with an InsP3R1 antibody (T1C) revealed a band with the apparent Mr of ∼300,000 (Fig. 1A). Sedimentation behavior of the immunopurified InsP3R1 in 5–20% sucrose density gradients was consistent with those of tetramers (data not shown). The functional integrity of the purified channel complex was confirmed in single-channel recordings of the InsP3R1 reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers (Fig. 1B). In the absence of agonist (InsP3) the channel was quiescent with rare opening events. Addition of 2 μm InsP3 to the cis chamber resulted in channel activity exhibiting frequent and rapid opening events. The InsP3-activated channels were blocked in the presence of 50 μg/ml heparin. The unitary conductance of the immunopurified receptor was compared with InsP3R channels obtained from CHAPS-solubilized cerebellar microsomes (InsP3RGE) (Fig. 1C). The conductance for the immunopurified channel was 222.2 ± 12.4 picosiemens, and the conductance for the gradient enriched was 275.8 ± 12.73 picosiemens. These results are similar to those obtained for the native and recombinant type 1 and 2 InsP3 receptors and suggest that the function of purified InsP3R1 is preserved through our purification steps (10Ramos-Franco J. Caenepeel S. Fill M. Mignery G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2783-2793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24Ramos-Franco J. Fill M. Mignery G.A. Biophys.

J. 2000; 79: 1388-1399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Visualization of InsP3R1 and Image Analysis—The purified InsP3R1 channel was vitrified in Buffer A containing 0.15% Triton X-100. Since no additional modulator was included during the cryospecimen preparation, the channel is considered to be in its closed conformation. Because of the low signal-to-noise ratio in the raw images, characteristic of membrane proteins on a continuous carbon substrate, the detailed features of the channel particles can be visually recognized only in the class averages after alignment/classification (Fig. 2). Each of these images represents the CTF-corrected average of several particles in nearly identical orientation. The image analysis revealed a sufficiently random distribution of orientations of the InsP3R1 particles in the data set, which were used for the three-dimensional reconstruction. Some characteristic views of the InsP3R1 clearly exhibit 4-fold symmetry (Fig. 2) and have dimensions of ∼250 × 250 Å, which are consistent with previously reported results from negative stain electron microscopy (5Chadwick C.C. Saito A. Fleischer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2132-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Maeda N. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 26Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover the 4-fold symmetry of the channel was further confirmed by the 4-fold appearance in some of the eigenimages calculated from multivariate statistical analysis using IMAGIC (15Serysheva I.I. Orlova E.V. Chiu W. Sherman M.B. Hamilton S.L. van Heel M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 19van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Thus, the final reconstruction was performed with imposed C4 symmetry. Overall Features of Three-dimensional Structure—The 30-Å-resolution three-dimensional reconstruction of the InsP3R1 exhibits two major morphological regions on opposite sides of the channel (Fig. 3). These consist of a pinwheel-shaped region of about 250 Å in diameter comprised of four curved radial spokes (Fig. 3A) and an opposing square-shaped region of 130 Å in side length exhibiting a central mass depression of ∼35 Å in diameter (Fig. 3C). At this resolution, we cannot be certain of the exact molecular boundary of individual subunits. However, we could describe one-quarter of the channel, which is equivalent to a single channel subunit (Mr ∼ 313,000) in terms of multiple structural domains (A, B, C, D, and transmembrane (TM)) based on their morphological appearance and density connectivity. Each spoke consists of two domains, A and B, which are roughly equal in size (∼100 × 60 × 55 Å). The spoke is connected to a central core region at the 4-fold axis of the structure by a bridge density, domain C. The central core region has a crown shape on one end and a funnel-shaped cavity on the opposite end (Fig. 3D). The TM domain has a bean-like shape of roughly 50 × 75 × 120 Å and is connected to domain C by a 40-Å-long column density, domain D (Fig. 3, B and D). Comparisons with Other Structures—The overall appearance of our three-dimensional reconstruction is consistent with the map of the InsP3R1 based on the negatively stained InsP3R1 (8Da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The pronounced differences are observed in the arrangement of the pinwheel region. This region in the negatively stained microscopy map is rather square-shaped with dimensions of ∼180 × 180 × 110 Å and exhibits very weak connecting densities between the peripheral density corresponding to our A domain and the central region. Unlike our three-dimensional map, the column domain D connecting the pinwheel structure with the TM domain is missing. These discrepancies may be introduced by different specimen preparative methods. Another 24-Å-resolution map of the InsP3R1 in its closed state was reported based on electron cryomicroscopy and single-particle reconstruction (7Jiang Q.X. Thrower E.C. Chester D.W. Ehrlich B.E. Sigworth F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3575-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This three-dimensional map is strikingly different from our three-dimensional reconstruction. While this map also contains a 4-fold symmetry, it appears to consist of a central core with very little peripheral mass in the pinwheel region. Since this reconstruction was also performed using EMAN (without EMAN's CTF correction) with some initial analysis in IMAGIC, it seems unlikely that this is a software problem but probably represents a fundamental difference in the raw data. The receptor purification strategy used in this study uses single-step chromatography over an immunoaffinity matrix with Triton X-100 while Jiang et al. (7Jiang Q.X. Thrower E.C. Chester D.W. Ehrlich B.E. Sigworth F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3575-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) used CHAPS. Additionally da Fonseca (8Da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) used essentially the same strategy as Jiang et al. (7Jiang Q.X. Thrower E.C. Chester D.W. Ehrlich B.E. Sigworth F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3575-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) with the only major difference being the use of Triton X-100 and Surfact-Amps X-100. It is possible that the apparent discrepancies between the structures are a consequence of the different detergents. Additionally our protein isolation was performed at pH 7.4, whereas the other preparations (7Jiang Q.X. Thrower E.C. Chester D.W. Ehrlich B.E. Sigworth F.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3575-3581Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) were made at alkaline pH. These pH changes may induce additional conformational transitions of the channel. Consistent with this notion, it has been demonstrated that a sharp increase in InsP3 binding to cerebellar membranes occurs at alkaline pH (27Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12132-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another more remote possibility for the observed differences in the structures is the use of receptor from Bos tarus, while the other structures are derived from rat cerebella. However, this is highly unlikely since the rat and bovine receptors have a 92% amino acid identity. Clearly more experimentation will be required to determine the cause of this discrepancy. Localization of InsP3-binding Domain—The N terminus of the InsP3R1 monomer has been established to contain the InsP3-binding site (residues 226–578), which provides specific and high affinity ligand binding independent of tetramer formation. The x-ray structure of the InsP3-binding core of mouse InsP3R1 in complex with InsP3 was recently reported at 2.2-Å resolution (21Bosanac I. Alattia J.R. Mal T.K. Chan J. Talarico S. Tong F.K. Tong K.I. Yoshikawa F. Furuichi T. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Nature. 2002; 420: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). To assign mass density for this domain within our three-dimensional structure of InsP3R1, we docked the crystal structure blurred to 30-Å resolution into the three-dimensional map of InsP3R1 using FOLDHUNTER software (22Jiang W. Baker M.L. Ludtke S.J. Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The shown fit represents the highest scoring match and places the InsP3-binding region in the B domain within the pinwheel structure (Fig. 4). The next several highest scores were in virtually identical locations and overall orientations. Since the next match in a substantially different location was such a poor fit visually that it was considered unreasonable, we consider this fit to be definitive within the resolution limit of the current data. Our localization of the InsP3-binding domain is consistent with its recent mapping using heparin-gold labeling and negative stain electron microscopy (26Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In their study, the heparin-binding domain was localized to the peripheral region of the InsP3R1 at a distance over 50 Å away from the central region of the channel, which is equivalent to domain B in our structure. However, our localization is different from that of another electron microscopy study, which suggested the InsP3-binding domain is close to the 4-fold axis (8Da Fonseca P.C. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Taylor C.W. Morris E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3936-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Their conclusion was inferred from an earlier ligand binding study using dimers of InsP3 linked by polyethylene glycol molecules of varying lengths (10–80 Å) (28Riley A.M. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Correa V. Potter B.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40290-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that suggested that the InsP3-binding sites are separated by no more than 20 Å. This estimate is inconsistent with our map where the InsP3-binding sites assigned to the B domains are spaced at least 100 Å apart. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the radioligand binding studies were performed at pH 8.3 (28Riley A.M. Morris S.A. Nerou E.P. Correa V. Potter B.V. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40290-40295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which is optimal for binding of InsP3, while our study and the heparin-binding site mapping study (26Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) used a pH of 7.4. Conformational transitions may take place in the channel upon changing the pH as suggested previously (27Worley P.F. Baraban J.M. Supattapone S. Wilson V.S. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12132-12136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Putative Assignment of Sequence to Domains within Three-dimensional Map—Thus, having assigned the InsP3-binding core to the B domain, it seems reasonable to suggest that the pinwheel region of the channel is exposed to the cytoplasm, while the opposite square-shaped region includes the transmembrane channel domain and faces into the endoplasmic reticulum. This assignment concurs with the topological model of the InsP3R deduced from biochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular experiments (1Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29483-29492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2Galvan D.L. Mignery G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48248-48260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 3Joseph S.K. Boehning D. Pierson S. Nicchitta C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1579-1588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 4Ramos-Franco J. Galvan D. Mignery G.A. Fill M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting that about 89% of the channel polypeptide is located in the cytoplasm, while the remaining, smaller portion (11%) represents the transmembrane channel domain. The square-shaped region of our three-dimensional reconstruction includes about 20% of the total channel volume, thus the remaining portion, that is about 80% of the total volume, accounts for the pinwheel structure and the column domains. Our fitted model shows that the C terminus (residue 602) of the InsP3-binding fragment that covers the InsP3-binding core (residues 226–578) is located close to the A domain (Fig. 4C). This putative position suggests that the A domain may include part of the sequence following the InsP3-binding domain, which has been referred to as the modulatory/coupling domain (residues 579–2275). The modulatory domain has been reported to contain binding sites for InsP3R1 channel modulators including Ca2+, calmodulin, FKBP12 (12-kDa FK506-binding protein), and ATP and modulatory phosphorylation sites. We propose that the internal coupling domain resides within the spoke and the central core regions. These regions probably would undergo significant conformational changes to modulate the channel gating. In support of this hypothesis, it was previously shown that a cytoplasmic N-terminal region including the ligand-binding and a portion of the coupling/regulatory domain (residues 1–1803) of the recombinant type 1 receptor indeed undergoes a large conformational change upon the binding of InsP3 (11Mignery G.A. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3893-3898Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). It was reported recently that high Ca2+ concentrations regulate the structural rearrangement of the peripheral regions of the InsP3R1 (26Hamada K. Miyata T. Mayanagi K. Hirota J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21115-21118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and possibly InsP3-mediated gating. Furthermore our fitting suggests that the N-terminal sequence (residues 1–223) of the InsP3R1 monomer resides in the domain C and/or the column domain D. Therefore the column domain D probably contains the C-terminal sequence (residues 2590–2749) and provides a connection of the ligand-binding region to the channel pore-forming region. It is known that the transmembrane sequences reside between residues 2276 and 2589. Therefore, the TM domain would be partially made up with this sequence. Our assignment places the N and C termini of the InsP3R1 monomer close to each other, which is consistent with cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation studies (29Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus, we have presented the three-dimensional map for domain organization of the InsP3R1. In this model, the InsP3-binding region is positioned in one of the domains within the cytoplasmic region that is far from the transmembrane domain of InsP3R1. This localization of the ligand-binding region implies a highly allosteric mechanism for regulation of channel gating, which would require long range conformational changes in the cytoplasmic region of InsP3R1 to trigger the channel opening. Further structural studies at higher resolution combined with specific labeling techniques as well as recombinant receptor mutants will refine the proposed model for the three-dimensional arrangement of the InsP3R1 channel.

Biotin (vitamin B8) is a water-soluble molecule acting as a cofactor for a small number of enzymes involved in carboxylation, decarboxylation, and transcarboxylation reactions that are concerned with fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism (1Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Google Scholar, 2Alban C. Job D. Douce R. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 17-47Google Scholar). The biotin biosynthesis pathway described in bacteria is conserved in plants, and the last step of this pathway, undoubtedly the most complex, involves the biotin synthase protein, the bio2 gene product in Arabidopsis thaliana (3Eisenberg M.A. Neidhardt F.C.

The fascinating reaction catalyzed by biotin synthase, i.e. the insertion of a sulfur atom between the unactivated methyl and methylene carbon atoms adjacent to the imidazolidone ring of dethiobiotin (DTB) 1The abbreviations used are: DTB, dethiobiotin; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; Adx, adrenodoxin; AdxR, adrenodoxin reductase; Fdx, ferredoxin. 1The abbreviations used are: DTB, dethiobiotin; AdoMet, S-adenosylmethionine; Adx, adrenodoxin; AdxR, adrenodoxin reductase; Fdx, ferredoxin. (Scheme 1), still remains an enigma for chemists and biologists. Recently, both the structure of the iron-sulfur centers of the enzyme and some aspects of the catalytic mechanism of the reaction (AdoMet dependence, sulfur atom donor, and electron donating system) have been unraveled by further studies essentially realized in Escherichia coli. First, biotin synthase (bioB gene product in Escherichia coli) is a dimeric enzyme of 76 kDa with a novel iron-sulfur center organization. Indeed, it is evolved to accommodate simultaneously two different oxygen-sensitive clusters, one [4Fe-4S]2+ and one [2Fe-2S]2+ per monomer, with unique roles in catalysis (6Ugulava N.B. Gibney B.R. Jarrett J.T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8343-8351Google Scholar). The [4Fe-4S] could be ligated by three cysteines of a CX3CX2C box, and a fourth, still unidentified ligand (7Sanyal I. Cohen G. Flint D.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3625-3631Google Scholar, 8Hewitson K.S. Baldwin J.E. Shaw N.M. Roach P.L. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 372-376Google Scholar, 9McIver L. Baxter R.L. Campopiano D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13888-13894Google Scholar). More recently, Ugulava et al. (10Ugulava N.B. Surerus K.K. Jarrett J.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9050-9051Google Scholar) proposed that the [2Fe-2S] center could be ligated at an alternative site not previously occupied by the [4Fe-4S] center. Second, the catalytic mechanism of biotin synthase reaction entitles the classification of this enzyme among the “radical AdoMet superfamily” (11Guianvarc'h D. Florentin D. Tse Sum Bui B. Nunzi F. Marquet A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 7: 240-246Google Scholar, 12Sofia H.J. Chen G. Hetzler B.G. Reyes-Spindola J.F. Miller N.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1097-1106Google Scholar). Indeed, during the biotin synthase reaction, a radical species is generated by reductive cleavage of AdoMet (13Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Sanakis Y. Hewitson K. Roach P. Münck E. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13449-13454Google Scholar). This radical species is necessary to permit the introduction of the sulfur atom into DTB. Cysteine is very likely the initial source of the sulfur atom for the reaction (14Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Google Scholar), but recent work provides evidence that the immediate sulfur donor is biotin synthase itself, at least in vitro (15Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Méjean A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Google Scholar, 16Gibson K.J. Pelletier D.A. Turner Sr., I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 632-635Google Scholar). Finally, a physiological reduction system is indispensable for the enzyme activity, whose role is to reduce AdoMet, through the [4Fe-4S] center, to generate the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. In E. coli, it consists of flavodoxin, flavodoxin (ferredoxin)-NADP+ reductase, NADPH, and possibly another FMN-containing flavoprotein, MioC (14Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19158-19165Google Scholar, 17Ifuku O. Koga N. Haze S. Kishimoto J. Wachi Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 173-178Google Scholar, 18Sanyal I. Gibson J. Flint D.H. Arch. Biochem.

The reported activities with well defined assay mixtures rarely exceed 1 nmol of biotin/nmol of monomer. This failure to obtain multiple turnovers has sometimes been put forward to propose that biotin synthase is not an enzyme but a reactant. It has also been suggested that either BioB is irreversibly inactivated during the reaction by some undefined mechanism or that an important cofactor of the protein is missing in the in vitro assay mixtures. Importantly, Ollagnier-de-Choudens et al. (20Ollagnier-de-Choudens S. Mulliez E. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 465-468Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that 5′-deoxyadenosine, a product of the reaction, is a very strong inhibitor of biotin formation in vitro, thus providing a convenient explanation for the lack of multiple turnovers.In plants, we have recently described the first biochemical characterization of the biotin synthase reaction (21Picciocchi A. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1224-1233Google Scholar). The bio2 gene product is a homodimer of 78 kDa presenting a high amino acid sequence similarity with the bacterial protein (4Baldet P. Ruffect M.L. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1996; 309: 99-106Google Scholar). Therefore, the CX3CX2C box is conserved and probably implied in an iron-sulfur ligation. Indeed, as its bacterial counterpart, the aerobically purified enzyme contains a [2Fe-2S]2+ center according to the UV-visible spectrum (22Baldet P. Alban C. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 206-210Google Scholar). Moreover, the catalytic mechanism of the reaction is AdoMet-dependent, and the synthesis of biotin is inhibited by acidomycin, a structural analogue of biotin (21Picciocchi A. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1224-1233Google Scholar). Like its bacterial counterpart, the bio2 gene product needs additional protein factors to function. Bacterial accessory proteins implied in the biotin synthase reaction efficiently complemented the plant enzyme (21Picciocchi A. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1224-1233Google Scholar). Our previous study has also shown the importance of mitochondria in the plant biotin synthesis. Therefore, we postulate that a mitochondrial physiological electron transfer system is required for plant biotin synthase reaction. It is probably similar to the system found in E. coli but implies different proteins because no flavodoxin has been documented in plants.In the present work, we report the identification and the characterization of mitochondrial accessory proteins involved with bio2 gene product in the plant biotin synthase reaction, including a low potential electron transfer chain. Cloning, expression, and purification of each of these proteins allowed the reconstitution, for the first time, of an in vitro functional plant biotin synthase complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—d-[8,9-3H]Biotin (42 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. (+)-[(6R),9-3H]DTB (2 Ci/mmol) was custom-synthesized by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Lactobacilli Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth, Micro Inoculum broth, and dehydrated biotin assay medium were from Difco. Isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was from Bioprobe Systems (Montreuil, France). His-binding resin was from Qiagen. Affi-Gel-10 and a molecular mass marker protein mixture for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad. All other biochemicals were obtained from Sigma and were the purest grade available.Plant Material, Bacterial Strains, and Plasmids—Potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L.) were obtained from a local market. The biotin auxotroph Lactobacillus plantarum (ATCC 8014) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). DNA manipulation was performed in E. coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen). Expression vectors pET28b(+), pET29a(+), pET21a(+), and the host strain E. coli BL21 (DE3) were from Novagen. Thermo-competent cells of this strain, prepared according to the method described in Ref. 23Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Google Scholar, were transformed with the different expression vectors used. The plasmid pBkat37 (carrying the molecular chaperones GroES and GroEL genes) (22Baldet P. Alban C. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 206-210Google Scholar) and the plasmid pSBET (24Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 196-198Google Scholar) (providing Arg triplets AGA and AGG frequently found in plant genes and in low abundance in E. coli) were used for optimal expression and correct folding of the recombinant proteins when indicated.Preparation of Purified Mitochondria—Potato tuber mitochondria were purified using Percoll gradients (25Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Google Scholar). Intact mitochondria were lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by sonication with a Vibra-cell disrupter (Sonics and Materials, Danbury, CT). The suspension was then centrifuged (100,000 × g, 20 min). The pellet and the supernatant comprised the mitochondrial membranes and the soluble fraction (matrix), respectively. Mitochondrial matrix (4 g of proteins) was concentrated (20 mg protein/ml) using Jumbosep-3 tubes (Filtron).Mitochondrial Matrix Fractionation—Mitochondrial matrix (400 mg of proteins) was loaded onto a gel filtration column (Superdex S200 Fast Flow, 2.6 cm × 60 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted with 320 ml of buffer A (flow rate 2 ml/min). Eighty fractions of 4 ml were collected and combined into four proteinaceous pools (pool I, fractions 1–40; pool II, fractions 41–50; pool III, fractions 51–58; pool IV, fractions 59–80). Each pool was concentrated using Jumbosep-3 tubes (Filtron) and desalted on a PD10 Sephadex G-25(M) column (Amersham Biosciences). The gel filtration column chromatography was repeated 10-fold in order to fractionate 4 g of mitochondrial matrix proteins.Gel filtration pool IV (180 mg of proteins) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow column (2.6 × 12 cm, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer B. Elution was then performed with a linear gradient of KCl from 0 to 0.3 m (300 ml) and 0.3 to 0.5 m (50 ml) in buffer B (flow rate 2 ml/min). One hundred fractions of 4 ml were collected. A 100-μl aliquot of each 4-ml fraction was assayed for biotin-forming activity in combination with pure Bio2 and gel filtration pool II (see “Results”). Fractions eluted with 80–150 and 350–450 mm KCl were required to restore biotin synthase activity. Separate pools of these fractions were concentrated using Jumbosep-3 tubes and desalted on a PD10 Sephadex G-25(M) column. The DEAE-Sepharose column 350–450 mm KCl eluted pool (10 mg protein) was further fractionated on a hydroxylapatite Bio-Gel HTP column (5 × 1 cm, Bio-Rad) equilibrated previously with buffer C (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 6.8), 1 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of phosphate buffer from 0 to 100 mm potassium phosphate (100 ml) in buffer C (flow rate 0.5 ml/min). Fifty fractions of 2 ml were collected. A 50-μl aliquot of each 2-ml fraction was assayed for biotin-forming activity in combination with pure Bio2, gel filtration pool II, and DEAE-Sepharose column 80–150 mm KCl eluted pool (see “Results”). The pooled active HTP fractions (0.7 mg of protein) were concentrated using Macrosep-3 tubes, desalted, and stored at –80 °C.Gel filtration pool II was fractionated onto a DEAE-Sepharose Fast-Flow column. The chromatographic conditions were the same as those described previously for fractionation of gel filtration pool IV. A 100-μl aliquot of each eluted fraction was assayed for biotin-forming activity in association with purified recombinant Bio2, Adx1, and AdxR proteins (see below for definitions). Active fractions were pooled, concentrated using Macrosep-10 tubes, and stored at –80 °C until use.Engineering of Expression Vectors—The oligonucleotide primers utilized in this study (synthesized by MWG Biotech) are listed in Table I. For protein expression, adxR, adx1, adx2, and nfs1 cDNAs were cloned into pET expression vectors (Table I). Full-length cDNAs were obtained by PCR amplification of an A. thaliana (var. Columbia) cDNA library constructed in pYES (26Elledge S.J. Mulligan J.T. Ramer S.W. Spottswood M. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1731-1735Google Scholar). The PCR fragments were cloned into the cloning vector pPCR-Script (Stratagene) or pCR4Blunt-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the cDNAs were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were submitted to the GenBank™ Data Bank. After proper restriction enzyme digestion, DNA fragments containing the coding sequences were subcloned into different pET expression vectors (Table I). The E. coli expression vector pET28b(+) was used to place a His6 tag at the NH2 terminus of the polypeptide.Table IEngineering of expression vectorsPrimer namePrimer sequence (5′-3′)DigestionExpression vector constructionAdxR cDNA cloning5′-AdxRGGTCTTTGAAATTGGTGACCATGGGTAGATATCTAGCNcoI-HindIIIpET29-adxR3′-AdxRGGCCCTAGTTGGCTGCTGCTGCTAATAGATCCAdx1 cDNA cloning5′-Adx1CGGCGCCAAACATATGGTCTTCCATAGGCpET28-adx1 m5′-Adx1 mGCTCTTTCATCTCGACAGCATATGCTGCAAAGGCNdeI-EcoRI3′-Adx1GCTCTGAGACTATTAAGTGACTAGTGAGGAdx2 cDNA cloning5′-Adx2GCGGCAGTGACATATGATCGGTCATAGGNdeI-NotIpET28-adx23′-Adx2CGAAGAATCTCTGCGGAAACTAATGAGGNfs1 cDNA cloning5′-Nfs1CAAACCGAGGTTTTAGACATATGGCGTCTAAGGNdeI-NotIpET21-nfs13′-Nfs1CACAGTTTGAGTGGAACTGTTG Open table in a new tab Arabidopsis bio2 cDNA cloning has been described previously (22Baldet P. Alban C. Douce R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 206-210Google Scholar). The NdeI-BamHI DNA fragment containing the bio2 coding sequence was subcloned into the plasmid pET28b(+) in-frame with an NH2-terminal His6 tag coding sequence, yielding the plasmid pET28-bio2.Expression of Recombinant Proteins—For correct Bio2 and Adx1 folding, BL21 strains containing the plasmid pET28-bio2 or pET28-adx1m were transformed with the pBkat37 vector, whereas efficient expression of Nfs1 protein was achieved with BL21 strain co-transformed with the plasmid pET21-nfs1 and pSBET. The E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the different expression vectors were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. When A600 reached 0.6, 1 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside was added to induce recombinant protein synthesis. The cells were further grown for 16 h at 28 °C, harvested, and centrifuged for 20 min at 4,000 × g. After resuspension in appropriate buffer, each bacterial pellet was disrupted by sonication with a Vibra-Cell disrupter (100 pulses every 3 s on power setting 5). The soluble protein extract was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min.Purification of Recombinant Bio2 and Adx1 Proteins—Bio2 and Adx1 proteins were both purified by metal-chelate column chromatography. The cells containing the overexpressed Bio2 or Adx1 proteins were resuspended in buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl)) supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. The soluble protein extract was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (1.6 × 4 cm, Qiagen) previously equilibrated with 30 ml of buffer D supplemented with 5 mm imidazole. The column was washed with buffer D supplemented with 50 mm imidazole. The recombinant protein was then eluted using buffer D supplemented with 250 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the recombinant protein (Bio2 or Adx1) were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 15% (w/v) glycerol. Purified enzymes were aliquoted and stored at –80 °C until use.Purification of Recombinant AdxR Protein—Purified Adx1 protein (20 mg) was immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) mini-columns according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells containing the overexpressed AdxR were resuspended in buffer B and disrupted by sonication. The soluble protein extract (400 mg proteins) was loaded onto a Green-A-matrix (1.6 × 10 cm, Sigma) column equilibrated previously with buffer B. The column was washed with 100 ml of buffer B. Elution was then performed with 50 ml of buffer B supplemented with 1.5 m of KCl (flow rate 0.5 ml/min). Fractions containing proteins were combined, concentrated with Jumbosep-10 tubes, desalted, and loaded (50 mg of proteins) onto the Affi-Gel-Adx1 (1 × 3 cm) column that had been equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer B containing 50 mm of KCl. Proteins were eluted with 4 ml of buffer B supplemented with 1 m of KCl. The AdxR-containing fractions were combined, concentrated, and stored aliquoted at –80 °C.Purification of Recombinant Nfs1 Protein—The overexpressed Nfs1 protein was insoluble in E. coli. Inclusion bodies containing the recombinant protein were prepared and purified as described in Ref. 27Faure M. Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Macherel D. Sieker L. Ober R. Kahn R. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2890-2898Google Scholar. After separation on 12% SDS-PAGE, inclusion bodies proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue to locate the Nfs1 protein band. This band was then excised, placed into dialysis tubing (SnakeSkinT Dialysis Tubing 10K, Pierce), submitted to electroelution for 4 h at 50 V in 50 mm NH4HCO3, 0.1% SDS, and freeze-dried overnight. The prepared polypeptide (0.5 mg) was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline and used to obtain rabbit antibodies.Enzyme Activity Assays—Biotin synthase activity was measured in the presence of the bio2 gene product (10 μm monomer) and protein fractions (matrix proteins and/or purified recombinant accessory proteins), according to the radiochemical and microbiological protocols described previously (21Picciocchi A. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1224-1233Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture, in a final volume of 100 μl, contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2, 1 mm NADPH, 0.2 mm AdoMet, 5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, 0.1 mm thiamine pyrophosphate, 0.15 mm DTB, and 0.5 mm l-cysteine (or 1 mm Na2S when indicated).Cytochrome c reduction was assayed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) in the presence of 50 μm cytochrome c,50 μm NADPH, 10 μm Adx1, and 60 nm AdxR. The reduction of cytochrome c was followed by the absorption increase at 550 nm.Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE was performed in slab gels containing 12% (w/v) acrylamide. The conditions for gel preparation, sample solubilization, electrophoresis, and gel staining were detailed by Chua (28Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-436Google Scholar). Polypeptides were also transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose sheets (Bio-Rad) as described by Towbin et al. (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). For Western blot detections, rabbit antiserum raised against the recombinant mitochondrial Nfs1 protein from Arabidopsis and guinea pig antiserum raised against the recombinant AdxR from Arabidopsis were prepared (Elevage Scientifique des Dombes, Romans, France). Polyclonal anti-rabbit serum (Bio-Rad) and polyclonal anti-guinea pig serum (Sigma) were used as a second antibody. The presence of immune complexes was analyzed by chemiluminescence with an ECL kit (Roche Applied Science).Analytical Methods—Protein concentration was determined either by the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using Bio-Rad protein-assay reagent, with γ-globulin as a standard, or for pure proteins by measuring the absorbance at 205 nm (31Scopes R.K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 59: 277-282Google Scholar). UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Uvikon 860 (Kontron) spectrophotometer. DNA sequencing was performed on both strands using the Prism Kit with fluorescent dideoxynucleotides (Applied Biosystems, Genome Express, Meylan, France). Internal peptide sequencing was performed by Edman degradation after tryptic digestion of the proteins and purification of the resulting peptides by high pressure liquid chromatography (Institut Pasteur, Laboratoire de microséquençage des protéines, Paris, France). Kinetic data were fitted to the appropriate rate equations by nonlinear regression analyses using the Kaleidagraph program (Synergy Software, Reading, PA).RESULTSInvestigation of the Proteins Required for Biotin Synthase Activity in Vitro—The bio2 gene product is not able to support biotin synthesis by itself. In a previous study, we have shown that mitochondrial matrix prepared from potato tubers was essential in addition to the bio2 gene product to synthesize biotin in an in vitro reconstituted system (21Picciocchi A. Douce R. Alban C. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1224-1233Google Scholar). In order to identify the accessory proteins required for the reaction in plants, we carried out the fractionation of mitochondrial matrix proteins by different chromatographic steps. First of all, the matrix was fractionated on a gel filtration column (Fig. 1). Four proteinaceous pools were arbitrarily defined and named pool I, II, III and IV. Then 0.5 mg of protein from each of these pools was combined with the purified bio2 gene product, and the biotin synthase activity of the resulting associations was measured. As shown in Fig. 1B, pool IV was the only one efficient in the restoration of biotin synthase activity. However, under our assay conditions, subsequent addition of pool II to Bio2 and pool IV led to a 1.5–2-fold increase of the activity. Therefore, we suppose that pool IV contains all the components involved in the physiological reduction system necessary for biotin synthase activity. Pool II should contain other stimulating component(s) for the biotin synthase reaction.Fig. 1Gel filtration chromatography.A, mitochondrial matrix (400 mg of proteins) was applied onto a gel filtration column (Superdex S200), and proteins were eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Four proteinaceous pools were arbitrarily defined. Horizontal arrows indicate the elution positions of the pools. B, aliquots of each pool (0.5 mg of protein) were associated with the bio2 gene product (10 μm), and biotin synthase activity was measured. Biotin produced during the reaction (2 h at 37 °C) was determined using the microbiological method with L. plantarum (see “Experimental Procedures”). The error bars represent standard deviations from three independent measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Identification of the Active Proteins in Pool IV—Pool IV was fractionated further on a DEAE-Sepharose column. None of the individual fractions eluted from the DEAE-Sepharose column were active in the biotin synthase assay. This implied that more than one component was present in pool IV and that these components had been separated on the anion-exchange column. Indeed, under our in vitro assay conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”), both fractions eluted with 80–150 and 350–450 mm KCl, respectively, were required, in addition to the bio2 gene product and the gel filtration pool II (see Fig. 1), to trigger efficient biotin synthase activity.Identification of the Active Protein in the DEAE Column 350–450 mm KCl Eluted Pool—The DEAE 350–450 mm KCl eluted pool was loaded onto a hydroxylapatite (HTP) column. The active component was eluted with a linear phosphate-buffered gradient. Biotin synthase activity was measured with each of these HTP fractions in association with Bio2, gel filtration pool II (see Fig. 1), and the DEAE 80–150 mm KCl eluted pool. Biotin production was observed with the HTP fractions eluted with 30–50 mm phosphate buffer. At this stage of the purification, a slight red coloration was associated with this mitochondrial active fraction. UV-visible absorbance spectrum showed characteristic peaks for iron-sulfur proteins containing [2Fe-2S] clusters (Fig. 2A). SDS-PAGE analysis of the concentrated active fraction revealed the presence of two major proteins, named P1 and P2, and less abundant proteins of higher molecular masses (Fig. 2B). The apparent molecular masses of the P1 and P2 proteins were 22 and 16 kDa, respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis of the individual active HTP fractions showed that only the quantitative variation of the P1 protein was perfectly correlated with the quantitative variation of the biotin synthase activity (data not shown). As a result, despite the occurrence of two major proteins, P1 protein and not P2 protein seemed to play a role in the biotin synthase reaction. To confirm this, both P1 and P2 proteins prepared from potato tuber mitochondria were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Two peptides from P1 protein and one from P2 protein were sequenced, respectively (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2C, P2 protein was identified as H-protein, one of the components of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system by a FASTA search in the Arabidopsis genome data base. Thus, as expected, this protein was unlikely to be involved in the physiological reduction system required for biotin synthase activity. On the contrary, a strong similarity was found between the two peptide sequences of the P1 protein and two adrenodoxin-like proteins of Arabidopsis, annotated as putative mitochondrial ferredoxins (Fig. 2C). Adrenodoxins are small iron-sulfur proteins with electron transfer properties that belong to the large family of the [2Fe-2S]-type ferredoxins ubiquitously found in plants, animals, and bacteria. These properties of Adx made P1 protein a good candidate for being the HTP 30–50 mm phosphate eluted pool component involved in the biotin synthase reaction. It is also responsible for the reddish coloration of this HTP active fraction (Fig. 2A). We have isolated and sequenced full-length cDNAs from Arabidopsis that we named adx1 and adx2, corresponding to these putative mitochondrial ferredoxins, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both Adx1 and Adx2 deduced amino acid sequences consist of 197 residues yielding proteins of 22 kDa.

We hypothesized that this process is mediated by the presence of the membrane-spanning segments of inner membrane proteins, rather than by dedicated flippases. In support of the hypothesis, it was demonstrated that transmembrane α-helical peptides, mimicking the membrane-spanning segments, mediate flop of 2–6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl) aminocaproyl (C6-NBD)-phospholipids (Kol, M. A., de Kroon, A. I., Rijkers, D. T., Killian, J. A., and de Kruijff, B. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 10500–10506). Here the dithionite reduction assay was used to measure transbilayer equilibration of C6-NBD-phospholipids in proteoliposomes, composed of Escherichia coli phospholipids and a subset of bacterial membrane proteins. It is shown that two well characterized integral proteins of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, leader peptidase and the potassium channel KcsA, induce phospholipid translocation, most likely by their transmembrane domains. In contrast, the ATP-binding cassette transporter from the E. coli inner membrane MsbA, a putative lipid flippase, did not mediate phospholipid translocation, irrespective of the presence of ATP. OmpT, an outer membrane protein from E. coli, did not facilitate flop either, demonstrating specificity of protein-mediated phospholipid translocation. The results are discussed in the light of phospholipid transport across the E. coli inner membrane.

The results are discussed in the light of phospholipid transport across the E. coli inner membrane. Biological membranes are composed of proteins and lipids, the latter organized as a bilayer. Cellular growth requires influx of new membrane components into the membranes. Because the synthesis of phospholipids, the major lipid constituents of most biological membranes, is generally confined to one leaflet of biogenic membranes (i.e. membranes containing phospholipid biosynthetic enzymes), transport of phospholipids to the other membrane leaflet is required. It has been shown that biogenic membranes, such as bacterial plasma membranes (1Huijbregts R.P. de Kroon A.I. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys.

Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 13: 163-170Google Scholar). In contrast to flip-flop in biogenic membranes, phospholipid translocation in model membranes composed of only lipids is very slow (9Kornberg R.D. McConnell H.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1111-1120Google Scholar). It is therefore generally accepted that phospholipid translocation is a protein-mediated process. In some membranes, this activity has been attributed to dedicated proteins (see e.g. Ref. 10Bevers E.M. Comfurius P. Dekkers D.W. Zwaal R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 317-330Google Scholar); however, the identities of the putative phospholipid translocators, or flippases, in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and in the endoplasmic reticulum remain obscure despite many efforts. Based on the general characteristics of flip-flop, we hypothesized that the mere presence of α-helical stretches of transmembrane proteins is sufficient for flop to occur, rendering the elusive flippases redundant. We showed previously that the presence of synthetic transmembrane peptides, mimicking the α-helical stretches of transmembrane proteins, induces flop of C6-NBD-PL 1The abbreviations used are: C6-NBD-PL, 1 palmitoyl-2,6-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)aminocaproyl-sn-glycero-3-phospholipid; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside; IM, inner membrane; Lep, Leader peptidase from E. coli; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; LUVETs, large unilamellar vesicles prepared by extrusion technique; OG, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; -Pi, inoganic phosphate; PL, phospholipid(s); TLE, total phospholipid extract of E. coli; TMH, transmembrane helix. analogues in model membranes (11Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10500-10506Google Scholar, 12Kol M.A. Van Laak A.N. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. De Kroon A.I. De Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 231-237Google Scholar), supporting this hypothesis. Bacterial membrane proteins display a large diversity in structure and organization, more than can be accounted for by α-helical model peptides. α-Helical membrane proteins often span the bilayer with several TMHs, whereas the model peptides are single-spanning. Additionally, membrane proteins usually have domains outside the membrane, and in some cases form oligomers. Here we report on phospholipid translocation, induced by a subset of well characterized membrane proteins with different membrane organizations, briefly described below. Leader peptidase (Lep) from Escherichia coli has two membrane-spanning α-helices and adopts an overall Nout/Cout topology in the inner membrane (IM) of E. coli (13Laws J.K. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2095-2099Google Scholar). The large C-terminal catalytic domain is in close contact with the periplasmic leaflet of the IM, interacting with phospholipids (14van Klompenburg W. Paetzel M. de Jong J.M. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 75-79Google Scholar, 15van den Brink-van der Laan E. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9677-9684Google Scholar). Lep is an essential protein (16Date T. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 76-83Google Scholar) involved in membrane biogenesis, as it clips off the signal peptide of proteins that are translocated via the E. coli Sec machinery. Moreover, its purification and functional reconstitution in proteoliposomes have been characterized (17Ohno-Iwashita Y. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 1895-1900Google Scholar, 18van Dalen A. Killian A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19913-19918Google Scholar). Taken together, this renders Lep an excellent model protein to test our hypothesis. The potassium channel KcsA is another well characterized protein of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. Its crystal structure has been determined (19Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Google Scholar). Unlike Lep, KcsA is an oligomeric protein forming a stable homotetramer (20Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Google Scholar). Each monomer contains two membrane-spanning domains and has an overall Nin/Cin topology. The interaction of KcsA with lipids has been characterized, as well as the role lipids play in its membrane assembly (21Valiyaveetil F.I. Zhou Y. MacKinnon R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10771-10777Google Scholar, 22van Dalen A. Hegger S. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 33-38Google Scholar). The E. coli inner membrane protein MsbA was chosen as a representative of the large superfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins, or traffic ATPases. In bacteria, the ATP-binding cassette transporters have a complex membrane organization with two hydrophobic domains, each of them typically spanning the membrane six times (23Putman M. van Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 672-693Google Scholar). MsbA is a homodimer, the 64-kDa monomer spanning the membrane with six TMHs (24Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Google Scholar, 25Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar). It was shown to be an ATPase (26Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Google Scholar). The msbA gene was first discovered as a multicopy suppressor of mutations in htrB (24Karow M. Georgopoulos C. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 69-79Google Scholar), which encodes a protein involved in the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Overexpression of msbA was shown to complement the htrB phenotype by restoring transport of non-mature LPS precursors. In a temperature-sensitive msbA strain, LPS precursors and phospholipids accumulate in the inner membrane at the non-permissive temperature (27Zhou Z. White K.A. Polissi A. Georgopoulos C. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12466-12475Google Scholar). Based on these observations and on the recently resolved crystal structure (25Chang G. Roth C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 1793-1800Google Scholar), MsbA was suggested to be a (phospho)lipid flippase, which provided an extra rationale for testing the capacity of this protein to induce phospholipid translocation. Apart from α-helical transmembrane segments, another principal structural motif by which integral membrane proteins span the bilayer is a β-barrel. In E. coli, β-barrel proteins are exclusively found in the outer membrane. We included the E. coli protease OmpT, with known crystal structure (28Vandeputte-Rutten L. Kramer R.A. Kroon J. Dekker N. Egmond M.R. Gros P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5033-5039Google Scholar), as a paradigm for the β-barrel membrane proteins to investigate whether phospholipid flop is facilitated by membrane proteins with other membrane-spanning structures. All proteins tested were reconstituted in proteoliposomes composed of E. coli phospholipids, and translocation of the phospholipid analogue C6NBD-PG was measured fluorimetrically by determining its susceptibility toward dithionite reduction. Evidence is presented that a subset of integral membrane proteins of the bacterial inner membrane facilitates phospholipid translocation via their transmembrane α-helices. The efficiency of flop induced by different proteins varied. Moreover, data are presented that argue against MsbA being an ATP-dependent phospholipid flippase. Materials—The E. coli total phospholipid extract was isolated from the wild-type strain W3899 as described previously (11Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10500-10506Google Scholar), or obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and purified on a silica column (11Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10500-10506Google Scholar). All other lipids were obtained from Avanti and used without further purification. Stock solutions were prepared in chloroform or ethanol, stored under N2 at –20 °C, and periodically checked for purity by thin layer chromatography. WALP23 (AcGWWL(AL)8WWA-nh2) was synthesized as described (29Killian J.A. Salemink I. de Planque M.R. Lindblom G. Koeppe R.E. Greathouse D.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1037-1045Google Scholar, 30de Planque M.R. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe II, R.E. Schafer H. Marsh D. Killian J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9333-9345Google Scholar). Peptide H1, corresponding to the N-terminal residues 1–25 of Lep, AcNleANNleFALILVIATLVTGILWCVDKF-nh2, and a positively charged derivative with an N-terminal 3-amino acid substitution named H1′ (AcGKKNleFALILVIATLVTGILWCVDKF-nh2) were synthesized, essentially as described for WALP23, on an Applied Biosystems 433A Peptide Synthesizer using the FastMoc protocol on a 0.25 mmol scale. Norleucines (Nle) are isosteric substitutions for the methionine residues at positions 1 and 4 and were used because the latter are sensitive to oxidation. Stock solutions of the peptides in trifluoroethanol (0.48 mm) were prepared on the basis of weight and stored under N2 at –20 °C. Sodium dithionite (technical grade) was from Aldrich. All other chemicals used were analytical grade. Isolation and Purification of Proteins—Leader peptidase with a C-terminal His5 tag was produced in E. coli strain MC1061 carrying the p827 plasmid as described (31van Klompenburg W. Whitley P. Diemel R. von Heijne G. de Kruijff B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 349-353Google Scholar) with minor modifications as detailed below. After induction of Lep, cells were harvested and washed with 0.9% (w/v) NaCl. Subsequently the cells were resuspended at 1 g wet weight per 5 ml in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 300 ng/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml lysozyme, and incubated on ice for 1 h while stirring. The resulting spheroplasts were disrupted by sonication 10 times for 10 s on ice, using the Branson microtip at maximum allowed power. Residual intact cells and spheroplasts were removed by low spin centrifugation for 10 min at 3,000 × g, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 90,500 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet containing the inner membranes was solubilized in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside, 10 mm imidazole, and 100 mm NaCl. Undissolved material was removed by repeating the previous centrifugation step. The supernatant was loaded on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column with ∼7-ml column volume (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After washing the column with 5 volumes of the aforementioned buffer (10 mm imidazole), Lep was eluted with 60 mm imidazole and stored at a concentration of ∼0.25 mg/ml at –20 °C. The P2 domain of leader peptidase (Δ2-75) was produced and purified as described (15van den Brink-van der Laan E. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9677-9684Google Scholar) and stored as a stock of 0.1–0.2 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, at –20 °C. KcsA with an N-terminal His6 tag was overproduced and purified in E. coli strain BL21(λDE3) carrying a pT7-KcsA plasmid, essentially as described previously (20Cortes D.M. Perozo E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10343-10352Google Scholar, 32van Dalen A. Schrempf H. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 340-346Google Scholar). Cells were grown for 2 h after addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and harvested. The membrane fraction was isolated as described above. The membrane pellet was solubilized in 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 1 mm dodecylmaltoside (DDM) and applied to a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column. After washing the column with ∼5 volumes of 10 mm and ∼5 volumes of 50 mm imidazole in the above buffer, respectively, the protein was eluted with buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and stored at a concentration of 0.64 mg/ml at 4 °C. His-tagged MsbA was a kind gift from Drs. William Doerrler and Christian Raetz (26Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Google Scholar) and was stored at a concentration of ∼0.4 mg/ml in 0.1% (w/v) DDM, 200 mm imidazole, 50 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol at –20 °C. OmpTE211K/R218E, an OmpT mutant with reduced autoproteolytic activity 2M. Egmond, personal communication. produced and purified as described (33Kramer R.A. Brandenburg K. Vandeputte-Rutten L. Werkhoven M. Gros P. Dekker N. Egmond M.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1746-1752Google Scholar), was generously supplied by Gerard-Jan de Roon and Dr. Maarten Egmond and stored as a stock of 2.6 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1% n-octyl-oligo-oxoethylene, pH 8.3, at –20 °C. Preparation of Large Unilamellar Vesicles by Extrusion (LUVETs)— Vesicles with and without the model peptides H1 and WALP23 were prepared as described previously (11Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10500-10506Google Scholar), except for omitting K3Fe(CN)6. Briefly, a mixed film was prepared consisting of E. coli lipid extract (TLE), the indicated amount of peptide, and C6NBD-PG at 0.2 mol % of PL-Pi. The lipid film was hydrated with buffer Z (50 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) to a final concentration of 5 mm phospholipid. After repetitive freezing and thawing, and subsequent extrusion through 200-nm membrane filters (Anotop 10, Whatman, Maidstone UK), unilamellar, sealed vesicles symmetrically labeled with C6NBD-PG were obtained. Preparation of Proteoliposomes—Reconstitution of Lep into proteoliposomes was performed by octyl glucoside dilution as described (18van Dalen A. Killian A. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19913-19918Google Scholar, 34Ohno-Iwashita Y. Wolfe P. Ito K. Wickner W. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6178-6184Google Scholar). A lipid film containing TLE (typically 2 μmol of PL-Pi) and C6NBD-PG was mixed with octyl glucoside in buffer and Lep from the stock solution to yield a mixed micelle solution of TLE, Lep (1:1000), C6NBD-PG (0.5%), and octyl glucoside (10:1, ∼1.2% w/v) (molar ratios with respect to the PL-Pi content of the TLE), typically in a volume of 500 μl. The micelles were diluted with buffer Z at a rate of 10 ml/h to a volume of 24 ml and incubated overnight at 4 °C under continuous stirring. The resulting symmetrically NBD-labeled proteoliposomes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 293,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C and resuspended in a small volume of buffer Z. The model peptide WALP23 was reconstituted by octyl glucoside dilution following the same procedure, starting from a mixed lipid film containing the peptide at a 1:1000 molar ratio with respect to PL-Pi. To check whether the method of reconstitution influences the properties of the proteoliposomes with respect to phospholipid translocation, a second protocol was also used. LUVETs composed of TLE (∼5 mm PL-Pi) prepared in buffer Z were solubilized with octyl glucoside (OG) (1% (w/v) final concentration) resulting in an optically clear solution. Lep was added (1:1000 molar ratio with respect to PL-Pi), and the detergent was removed using Bio-Beads SM (Bio-Rad). Briefly, the mixed micelle solution was incubated for 30 min under gentle rotation at room temperature; ∼80 mg/ml Bio-Beads was added, and incubation was continued for 2 h. Next, the solution was added to 80 mg/ml fresh Bio-Beads and again incubated for 2 h under rotation. Subsequently, the solution was incubated overnight at 4 °C, again with fresh Bio-Beads. The vesicles were collected by centrifugation (1 h at 435,000 × g) and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer. KcsA was reconstituted as described (22van Dalen A. Hegger S. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 525: 33-38Google Scholar), based on a published protocol (15van den Brink-van der Laan E. Dalbey R.E. Demel R.A. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9677-9684Google Scholar). Briefly, LUVETs (∼5 mm TLE-Pi) containing 0.5% C6NBD-PG with respect to total PL-Pi, prepared in 10 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl were solubilized by adding Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 8 mm. The tetrameric protein was added at a molar ratio of 1:1000 or 1:2000 with respect to PL-Pi, as indicated, typically in a final volume of 700 μl. Detergent was removed using Bio-Beads as above. MsbA was reconstituted according to Doerrler et al. (26Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Google Scholar) with minor modifications. LUVETs (5 mm TLE-Pi) were prepared in 50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, and solubilized with 0.2% (w/v) DDM from a 20% (w/v) stock in H2O, yielding an optically clear solution. Protein was added to a 1:1000 molar ratio with respect to PL-Pi, in a final volume of 350 μl. Following dilution to 1 ml, detergent was removed with Bio-Beads as above. OmpT was reconstituted as described for OMPLA, another E. coli outer membrane protein (35.Kingma, R. L. (2002) Outer Membrane Phospholipase A: Studies on Structure-Function Relationships. Ph.D. thesis, Utrecht University, The NetherlandsGoogle Scholar). LUVETs prepared from TLE (∼5 mm PL-Pi) and containing C6NBD-PG (0.5% of total PL-Pi) in buffer Z were solubilized with OG added from a 20% (w/v) stock solution in buffer Z to a final concentration of 1% (w/v) and supplemented with OmpT at a 1:1000 molar ratio with respect to PL-Pi to form mixed micelles, which were subsequently incubated with Bio-Beads to remove detergent as above. Flop Assay—All procedures were performed as described previously (11Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10500-10506Google Scholar). The LUVETs or proteoliposomes, symmetrically labeled with C6NBD-PG, were incubated with 25 mm sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) for 5 min to reduce and thereby quench the fluorescent NBD label in the outer membrane leaflet, followed by gel filtration to remove excess dithionite. The resulting asymmetrically labeled vesicles were incubated at a concentration of ∼3 mm PL-Pi at the temperature indicated. At different time points aliquots of vesicles were taken, and the in-out translocation (flop) of NBD-phospholipids was measured by determining the amount of NBD-phospholipid susceptible to reduction by 8 mm sodium dithionite in 3 min at 20 °C. Flip Assay—Proteoliposomes (∼2 mm PL-Pi) were incubated 30 min on ice with 0.1 mol % NBD-PL, added from an ∼1 mm stock solution in ethanol, to allow the probe to incorporate in the outer membrane leaflet. The concentration of ethanol in the vesicle suspension never exceeded 0.2% (v/v). Phospholipid out-in translocation (flip) was initiated by shifting the vesicles to 37 °C. At different time points, aliquots were assayed for the transmembrane distribution of C6NBD-PG as described for the flop assay. The pool of C6NBD-PG protected against reduction by dithionite was taken as the amount of flip. Fluorescence Measurements and Calculations—Fluorescence measurements were performed as described (11Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10500-10506Google Scholar), in buffer Z unless noted otherwise, using an SLM Aminco SPF 500C spectrofluorometer (excitation 460 nm and emission 534 nm). The percentage of NBD-phospholipid in the outer (flop assay) or inner (flip assay) leaflet at different time points was calculated according to Equations 1 and 2, respectively, flop(%)=[1−(F180/F0)]·100 (Eq. 1) and flip(%)=(F180/F0)·100(Eq. 2) with F0 and F180 the fluorescence intensities after 0 and 180 s of reaction with dithionite. Equation 3 theoretically describes the process of flip or flop in a vesicle assuming that the inward and outward rate constants are equal (36Fattal E. Nir S. Parente R.A. Szoka F.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6721-6731Google Scholar), flip-flop(t)=0.5·(1−e−Kflip-flop•t)(Eq. 3) with flip-flop(t) the relative amount of flip or flop (depending on the experiment) at time t, the factor 0.5 representing the theoretical maximum value of flip-flop (50% redistribution of the probe), Kflip-flop the apparent first order rate constant of flip-flop, and t the time of incubation. In our system, flip-flop at t = 0 variably deviated from the theoretical value of 0%. To be able to compare flip-flop rate constants in vesicles of different compositions, Coffset was introduced as a constant equal to the amount of accessible NBD label at t = 0 in control vesicles without peptide or protein (0.03 < Coffset < 0.1, depending on the experiment). The apparent first order flip-flop rate constants (Kflip-flop) were calculated by a least squares fit to Equation 4, flip-flop(t)=Coffset+(0.5−Coffset)(1−e−Kflip-flop·t)(Eq. 4) Miscellaneous—Phospholipids were quantified according to Rouser et al. (37Rouser G. Fleischer S. Yamamoto A. Lipids. 1970; 5: 494-496Google Scholar). Phospholipid compositions and concentrations are presented based on lipid phosphorus (PL-Pi). C6NBD-PL contents of the membranes are presented as the mol % with respect to PL-Pi, before reduction with dithionite. Aliquots of proteoliposomes were mixed with sample buffer and heated to 95 °C before subjecting the samples to SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie-stained SDS gels were quantitated using bovine serum albumin as a standard, on a Bio-Rad GS-700 Densitometer using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad) to check the efficiency of reconstitution of the proteins. In the case of KcsA, proteoliposomes mixed with sample buffer were directly subjected to electrophoresis, to allow detection of the tetrameric protein. The extent of incorporation of WALP23 was checked by measuring Trp fluorescence in buffer Z containing 1% (w/v) octyl glucoside, (excitation 280 nm and emission 350 nm). ATPase activity was determined as described (26Doerrler W.T. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36697-36705Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the capacity of membrane proteins to induce helix-mediated phospholipid translocation in proteoliposomes, using short chain NBD-labeled phospholipids as probe molecules. Proteoliposomes are generally prepared by removal of detergent from a mixed micelle solution of lipids, protein, and detergent, in contrast to the previously used peptide-containing model membranes that were prepared by extrusion (11Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10500-10506Google Scholar, 12Kol M.A. Van Laak A.N. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. De Kroon A.I. De Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 231-237Google Scholar). Residual detergent in the proteoliposomes might compromise membrane integrity, in which case the dithionite reduction assay would not work, or might cause artifacts in phospholipid translocation. Therefore, the model peptide WALP23 was incorporated in vesicles by reconstitution from detergent and by extrusion of multilamellar vesicles prepared from a mixed peptide-lipid film. The resulting proteoliposomes and LUVETs, with and without WALP23 incorporated, were compared with respect to their permeability to dithionite, and the occurrence of flop of C6NBD-PG. The peptide/phospholipid ratios before (1:1000 mol/mol) and after vesicle preparation were similar for the two protocols (not shown). In both procedures C6NBD-PG was present during vesicle preparation and thus symmetrically incorporated in both membrane leaflets. Fig. 1A shows that vesicles prepared by the extrusion protocol and prepared by dilution from octyl glucoside have similar C6NBD-PG pools protected from dithionite reduction (∼35 and ∼40%, respectively), irrespective of the incorporation of WALP23. The quenching of the C6NBD-PG in the outer leaflet is completed in ∼3 min, as was shown previously (11Kol M.A. de Kroon A.I. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. de Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10500-10506Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that both reconstitution protocols yield vesicles that are sealed to dithionite and unilamellar. The slightly smaller protected C6NBD-PG pool in vesicles prepared by detergent dilution suggests that these vesicles are relatively small. Subsequently, the vesicles were treated with dithionite to quench the NBD fluorescence in the outer membrane leaflet. After removal of excess dithionite, the vesicles were incubated at 37 °C and assayed at different time points for the reappearance of C6NBD-PG in the outer leaflet. Fig. 1B shows that at 37 °C efficient flop occurs in vesicles containing WALP23 prepared by reconstitution from detergent, albeit at a slightly slower rate than in WALP23-containing LUVETs. The apparent first order flop rate constant at 37 °C in LUVETs containing WALP23 at a 1:1000 molar ratio was determined according to Equation 4 and found to be ∼0.8 h–1, 4 times higher than the flop rate constant at 25 °C (12Kol M.A. Van Laak A.N. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. De Kroon A.I. De Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 231-237Google Scholar), indicating that flop rates increase with temperature. The spontaneous translocation of C6NBD-PG in vesicles without peptide was slightly increased at 37 °C (Fig. 1B) as compared with 25 °C (12Kol M.A. Van Laak A.N. Rijkers D.T. Killian J.A. De Kroon A.I. De Kruijff B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 231-237Google Scholar). Together, these data clearly demonstrate that reconstitution from detergent yields vesicles in which the dithionite reduction assay can be used to measure peptide-induced flop and that any residual detergen"
https://openalex.org/W2065806813,"Two highly phosphorylated proteins were detected after two-dimensional (blue native/SDS-PAGE) gel electrophoretic separation of the matrix fraction isolated from potato tuber mitochondria. These two phosphoproteins were identified by mass spectrometry as formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and the E1α-subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE two-dimensional gels separated FDH and PDH and resolved several different phosphorylated forms of FDH. By using combinations of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, several phosphorylation sites were identified for the first time in FDH and PDH. FDH was phosphorylated on Thr76 and Thr333, whereas PDH was phosphorylated on Ser294. Both Thr76 and Thr333 in FDH were accessible to protein kinases, as demonstrated by protein structure homology modeling. The extent of phosphorylation of both FDH and PDH was strongly decreased by NAD+, formate, and pyruvate, indicating that reversible phosphorylation of FDH and PDHs was regulated in a similar fashion. At low oxygen concentrations inside the intact potato tubers, FDH activity was strongly increased relative to cytochrome c oxidase activity pointing to a possible involvement of FDH in hypoxic metabolism. Computational sequence analysis indicated that a conserved local sequence motif of pyruvate formate-lyase is found in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, and this enzyme might be the source of formate for FDH in plants. Two highly phosphorylated proteins were detected after two-dimensional (blue native/SDS-PAGE) gel electrophoretic separation of the matrix fraction isolated from potato tuber mitochondria. These two phosphoproteins were identified by mass spectrometry as formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and the E1α-subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Isoelectric focusing/SDS-PAGE two-dimensional gels separated FDH and PDH and resolved several different phosphorylated forms of FDH. By using combinations of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry, several phosphorylation sites were identified for the first time in FDH and PDH. FDH was phosphorylated on Thr76 and Thr333, whereas PDH was phosphorylated on Ser294. Both Thr76 and Thr333 in FDH were accessible to protein kinases, as demonstrated by protein structure homology modeling. The extent of phosphorylation of both FDH and PDH was strongly decreased by NAD+, formate, and pyruvate, indicating that reversible phosphorylation of FDH and PDHs was regulated in a similar fashion. At low oxygen concentrations inside the intact potato tubers, FDH activity was strongly increased relative to cytochrome c oxidase activity pointing to a possible involvement of FDH in hypoxic metabolism. Computational sequence analysis indicated that a conserved local sequence motif of pyruvate formate-lyase is found in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, and this enzyme might be the source of formate for FDH in plants. Reversible protein phosphorylation is one of the most important regulatory mechanisms in living cells (1Cohen P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: E127-E130Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), yet little is know about protein phosphorylation in mitochondria. The only well studied case is that of phosphorylation of the E1α-subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) 1The abbreviations used are: PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; BN, Blue Native; CCO, cytochrome c oxidase; FDH, formate dehydrogenase; IEF, isoelectric focusing; LC, liquid chromatography; MOPS, 4-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid; PFL, pyruvate formate-lyase; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; LC/MS, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry; ESI, electrospray ionization; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography. complex (2Mooney B.P. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The PDH complex contains both a kinase and a protein phosphatase, and phosphorylation inactivates the complex, which is reactivated by dephosphorylation. This means that the entry of carbon compounds from glycolysis into the citric acid cycle is turned off under conditions of high ATP concentration. Although the PDH kinase and phosphatase system is the only fully characterized system for reversible protein phosphorylation in mitochondria, there are clear indications that others are present.

Petruzzella V. Technikova-Dobrova Z. Vergari R. Signorile A. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2002; 34: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In a very recent study (18Bykova N.V. Egsgaard H. Møller I.M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 540: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) a further 14 mitochondrial phosphoproteins were identified, all household proteins involved in the citric acid cycle and associated reactions, the respiratory chain complexes, in heat shock proteins, and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Formate dehydrogenase (FDH) catalyzes the oxidation of formate to CO2 reducing NAD+ to NADH in the process. Formate may have a role in biosynthesis of numerous compounds, such as in energetic metabolism and in signal transduction pathways related to stress response. The enzyme is induced in potato leaves by a variety of stresses including hypoxia (19Colas des Francs-Small C. Ambard-Bretteville F. Small I.D. Rëmy R.

Ambard-Bretteville F. Small I.D. Rëmy R.

Biochem. 1999; 37: 503-513Crossref Google Scholar). In the present study we use two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to show that a major part of the phosphorylation in potato tuber mitochondria that was ascribed previously to PDH is due, in fact, to labeling of FDH. We identify the site of FDH (and PDH) phosphorylation and describe some properties of FDH phosphorylation. Finally, we show that FDH activity is highest in intact sprouting tubers where the oxygen concentration is relatively low implying that FDH has a role in hypoxic metabolism. Plant Material, Isolation, and Subfractionation of Intact Mitochondria—Intact and functional highly purified mitochondria were isolated from potato tubers (Solanum tuberosum L.) using differential centrifugation followed by Percoll density gradient centrifugation and subfractionated into inner membrane vesicles and a matrix fraction essentially as described previously (22Møller I.M. Lidén A.C. Ericson I. Gardeström P. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 442-453Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation Assay—Protein phosphorylation in intact plant mitochondria and in the mitochondrial subfractions was investigated by in vitro labeling analyses with [γ-32P]ATP. Phosphorylation assays were carried out at 25 °C for 10 min in a volume of 200 μl containing 1 mg of protein, 0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (AA0068, Amersham Biosciences), and 0.2 mm ATP. The reactions were terminated, and [γ-32P]ATP was removed from the mitochondria by addition of ice-cold reaction buffer and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h or for the matrix fraction by precipitation with 80% ice-cold acetone containing 35 mm mercaptoethanol followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. Two-dimensional Blue Native/PAGE—In the first dimension blue native electrophoresis was used in order to separate protein complexes according to their size (23Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar) followed by gradient 10–15% Tricine SDS-PAGE in the second dimension. For blue native gels 1 mg of matrix protein was supplemented with a buffer to give the following final concentrations: 750 mm aminocaproic acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Bis-Tris, pH 7.0 and 1.5% w/v n-dodecyl maltoside. Coomassie Blue solution, 15 μl of 5% (w/v) Serva Blue G, 750 mm aminocaproic acid, was added to the solution and loaded directly onto a 4.5% to 16% (w/v) acrylamide gradient blue native gels. BN-PAGE was carried out as described (23Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 24Jänsch L. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. Plant J. 1996; 9: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Isoelectric Focusing/Tricine SDS-PAGE—The isoelectric focusing was conducted with the IPGphor system (Amersham Biosciences) using 17-cm ReadyStrip IPG strips with a linear pH gradient range 5–8 according to the manufacturer's instructions (25Berkelman T. Stenstedt T. 2-D Electrophoresis Using Immobilized pH Gradients: Principles and Methods. Amersham Biosciences, 1998: 100Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins were solubilized in 300 μl of rehydration solution containing 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% w/v CHAPS, 2% w/v n-dodecyl maltoside, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1% v/v IPG buffer, pH 3.0–10.0. For rehydration with matrix proteins, the solution contained 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% IPG buffer, pH 3.0–10.0. Tricine SDS-PAGE was carried out as described (26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). The pI and molecular mass scales of the two-dimensional maps were calibrated using the ImageMaster two-dimensional Elite software (Amersham Biosciences). The 32P-containing phosphoproteins were visualized by PhosphorImaging using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Tryptic Peptides—MS/MS analysis of peptides generated by in-gel digestion as described previously (27Shevchenko A. Jensen O.N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Sagliocco F. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mortensen A. Shevchenko A. Boucherie H. Mann M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14440-14445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar) was performed on a Finnigan LCQ (Classic) quadrupole ion storage mass spectrometer (San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray source (Protana Engineering, Odense, Denmark). Prior to MS analysis samples were purified on reverse phase POROS R2 or OligoR3 (20–30 μm bead size, PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, CA) nanocolumns (28Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 29Stensballe A. Andersen S. Jensen O.N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and eluted with 1 μl of 50% (v/v) methanol, 5% (v/v) formic acid directly into the precoated borosilicate nanoelectrospray needles (Protana Engineering, Odense, Denmark). Phosphopeptide Purification by Nanoscale Fe(III)-IMAC—Phosphopeptides present in tryptic digestion mixtures generated from phosphoproteins were purified by miniaturized Fe(III)-IMAC columns as described (29Stensballe A. Andersen S. Jensen O.N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Peptide samples were redissolved in 0.1 m acetic acid containing 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and slowly loaded onto the IMAC column (loading time 120–140 s). The column was then washed with 0.1 m acetic acid, 10% (v/v) acetonitrile in 0.1 m acetic acid, Milli-Q water. Peptides were eluted from nanoscale IMAC columns by using pH 10.5 solvent (Milli-Q water adjusted to pH 10.5 by addition of 25% (v/v) ammonia). The eluate was acidified to 5% (v/v) formic acid and loaded directly onto a nanoscale column (28Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) packed with Oligo R3 material. The column was rinsed with 5% formic acid and then eluted with saturated matrix solution (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 50% (v/v) acetonitrile, 5% formic acid). The matrix/analyte eluate was spotted as a series of nanoliter volume droplets onto the MALDI probe. Peptide Mass Mapping by MALDI-TOF-MS—Delayed extraction MALDI mass spectra were recorded on a Reflex IV time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm). Mass spectra were acquired in both positive ion linear mode and positive ion reflector mode. Instrument mass calibration was performed by using a tryptic peptide mixture derived from bovine lactoglobulin (external calibration). Internal mass calibration of peptide mass spectra using digestion products of trypsin or from the identified proteins resulted in mass errors of less than 50 ppm, typically 15–25 ppm. Automated Nano-flow LC-MS/MS Analysis of Tryptic Peptides— Tryptic peptide mixtures were separated and analyzed using a nanoscale capillary high pressure liquid chromatography system (Ultimate, LC-Packings) interfaced directly to a Q-TOF tandem mass spectrometer (Q-TOF Ultima API, Micromass, UK). Peptide mixtures were separated on a C18 reverse phase column (75 μm (inner diameter) × 90.0 mm, Zorbax SB-C18 3.5 μm) during a 1.5-h gradient of 0–90% acetonitrile (v/v) containing 1% (v/v) formic acid, 0.6% (v/v) acetic acid, and 0.005% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid at a flow rate of 175 nl/min. The mass spectrometer was calibrated by using NaI (8-s scan time, m/z 400–2000). Data Base Searching and Protein Sequence Analysis—Ion trap tandem mass spectrometry data were interpreted by using the Mascot MS-MS Ions Search software (www.matrix-science.com). The Sequest program (Thermoquest, San Jose, CA) was used to convert ion trap MS/MS spectra into DTA format. Only matching peptides with precursor ion mass tolerance of less that 1 Da and individual ion scores indicating identity to the protein were taken into consideration and used for estimation of a minimum percentage sequence coverage. Mass spectra obtained by automated nano-flow LC-MS/MS using data-dependent acquisition modes were analyzed using the MassLynx 3.5 software (Micromass, UK) and Mascot MS-MS Ions Search. MALDI mass spectra were analyzed by using the software package m/z (Proteometrics Ltd., New York). The differential peptide mass mapping and analysis of theoretical tryptic peptide sequences were performed using GPMAW 5.01 (Lighthouse Data, Odense, Denmark). Tandem mass spectra obtained from phosphopeptides were manually inspected. Computer Modeling of S. tuberosum FDH—Sequence of S. tuberosum FDH was from NCBI-CAA79702 (19Colas des Francs-Small C. Ambard-Bretteville F. Small I.D. Rëmy R. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1171-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structural homology model was constructed with Swiss model 3.5 protein modeling server and the Swiss-PdbViewer version 3.7b2 (30Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar, 31Guex N. Diemand A. Peitsch M.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Measuring the Oxygen Concentration in Intact Potato Tubers—Tubers of 40–200 g fresh weight (average weight 109 g after peeling; 4–6 cm in diameter) stored at 4 °C were incubated at room temperature (22–24 °C) in darkness for 2–3 weeks and had started sprouting. An OX100 microelectrode from Unisense, Århus, Denmark, with a tip diameter of 100 μm was calibrated in air-saturated water immediately before use. A tuber was immobilized on a platform, and the electrode was inserted into the tuber using a micromanipulator. Two different insertion methods were used. (a) The electrode was inserted 25 mm into the tuber stopping for 1 min to take a reading just below the surface and at 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mm depth in the same hole. (b) Alternatively, the oxygen concentration at each depth was measured by sticking the electrode in at a new position. The read-out usually stabilized well before the minute was up, and the values were normally similar with the two insertion methods indicating that leakage of air into the tuber along the electrode did not occur. The oxygen concentration was calculated assuming that the water in equilibrium with air contains 270 μm oxygen at 22 °C (32Truesdale G.A. Downing A.L. Lowden G.F. J. Appl. Chem. 1955; 5: 153-162Google Scholar). After the oxygen concentration measurements the tuber was peeled and homogenized to give a soluble fraction where the activity of FDH and CCO was measured (see below). Enzyme Activity Measurements in Whole Tuber Extracts—Each tuber was homogenized separately using a Braun juice extractor and 17 ml of medium/100 g fresh weight containing 0.9 m mannitol, 30 mm MOPS, 3 mm EDTA, 0.3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm cysteine, pH 7.2. Large particles were removed by filtration through nylon cloth (mesh 120 μm) and centrifugation at 1600 × g for 10 min. After decantation and volume measurement, the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. CCO activity was measured as described previously (33Rasmusson A.G. Møller I.M. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). FDH activity was measured as NADH production at 340 nm in a medium containing 0.3 m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 μg/ml antimycin A, 15 mm formate, 1 mm NAD+, and 0.025% (v/v) Triton X-100. The reaction was started by the addition of sample, and it was linear for at least 5 min. Separation of FDH and PDH on Two-dimensional Gels—BN-gel electrophoresis separates protein complexes according to size, and the complexes can subsequently be separated into their component polypeptides by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension (23Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar, 26Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1694-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). On BN two-dimensional gels the 32P-labeled matrix fraction from potato tuber mitochondria shows a very large and heavily labeled spot at 42–45 kDa, which stretches from around 200 kDa down to <100 kDa in the 1st dimension (Fig. 1, A and B). MS identification showed that the E1α-subunit of PDH was only found in spots 1 and 2, whereas FDH was found in all parts of the smear indicating that this enzyme was also labeled (Table I). The E1α component of pea PDH forms a catalytically active unit of 160 kDa (2Mooney B.P. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and this may migrate intact under the conditions in the first dimension. FDH appears to migrate as a tetramer of the 40-kDa mature subunit (19Colas des Francs-Small C. Ambard-Bretteville F. Small I.D. Rëmy R.

Open table in a new tab On IEF/SDS-PAGE gels PDH and FDH again migrate in the same area (Fig. 2, A and B), but both are now found in several discrete spots. Only PDH was identified in spots 4–6 and only FDH in spots 3, 8, 10, 11, 16, 18, and 19 (Table I). Spots 1, 2, 7, 9, 12–15, and 17 contained both proteins. For FDH the two largest and most alkaline spots 18 and 19 were not labeled, indicating that only a minor part of FDH was labeled under the isolation and assay conditions used in this study. Identification of Site of Phosphorylation on PDH—Mammalian mtPDH is phosphorylated on three serines, only one of which is conserved in plant mtPDH. However, the site of plant mtPDH phosphorylation has not been identified previously. By using automated nano-flow LC-MS/MS, we identified a 14-amino acid-long phosphopeptide, Tyr290–Arg303 (Fig. 3) in the tryptic peptide mixture derived from protein spot 13 (Fig. 2). The same phosphopeptide was found in protein spots 1 and 12–14 (Figs. 1 and 2). The MS/MS scan in Fig. 3B derived from the peptide eluting at the time point is indicated with an arrow in Fig. 3A. The mass difference between the doubly protonated precursor ion ((M + 2H+)2+, m/z 837.94) and the ion of m/z 788.94 is a signature for the loss of phosphoric acid from the phosphopeptide via a gas-phase β-elimination mechanism. The mass difference between the peptide fragment ions y9 and y10 (69 Da) corresponds to the dehydroalanyl residue formed by loss of phosphoric acid from phospho-Ser294 (35Snyder A.P. Interpreting Protein Mass Spectra. A Comprehensive Resource. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 265-299Google Scholar). Thus, Ser294 in PDH is phosphorylated. Identification of the Phosphorylation Sites on FDH—Initial phosphorylation analysis of FDH was performed by using a combination of nanoscale Fe(III)-IMAC for enrichment of tryptic phosphopeptides and OligoR3 column for phosphopeptide concentration and desalting (29Stensballe A. Andersen S. Jensen O.N. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 207-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Identical phosphopeptide mass maps were obtained for FDH protein spots 1 and 2 on BN/SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A and Table I). Fig. 4A shows a MALDI mass spectrum of an IMAC-retained phosphopeptide from FDH. The ion at m/z 2215.0 is the unphosphorylated, singly charged 19-amino acid peptide Gly70–Lys88, whereas the ion at 2295.0 Da is the phosphorylated form of this peptide (HPO3, +80 Da). The peptide Gly70–Lys88 has two candidate phosphorylation sites, viz. residues Tyr73 and Thr76. Closer inspection of the mass spectrum reveals several ion signals indicative of β-elimination of phosphoric acid (see figure legend), making Thr76 the prime candidate for phosphorylation because Tyr(P) cannot undergo β-elimination. To confirm this hypothesis the Fe(III)-IMAC enriched phosphopeptide sample was next subjected to amino acid sequencing by nanoelectrospray ion trap tandem mass spectrometry using the triply protonated precursor ion (m/z 766.24) (Fig. 4B). About 10 fragment ions can be matched to the peptide, and in all cases the masses match a sequence containing dehydro-2-aminobutyryl residue instead of Thr76. The peptide gave quite a high prediction score 0.82 for phosphorylation when tested with the NetPhos 2.0 software (Table II). Thus, these experiments strongly indicate that Thr76 in FDH is phosphorylated.Table IIIdentification of predicted tryptic phosphopeptides for formate dehydrogenase from potato tuber mitochondriaPosition of tryptic peptideSequenceaModified amino acids are shown in boldface.Prediction score for residueComputed massObserved parent ions (charge state)70-88GHQYIVT 76PDKEGPDCELEK0.8202293.991148.00 (+2), 766.24 (+3)326-346YMPNQAMT 333PHISGTTIDAQLR0.6102424.10NDbND, a peptide giving the computed mass could not be detected for either charge state.326-346YMPNQAMT 333PHISGTTIDAQLRcMethionine residues were oxidized resulting in methionine sulfoxides.2456.09ND326-346YMPDEAMT 333PHISGTTIDAQLRdAsparagine and glutamine residues were modified via deamidation resulting in conversion to aspartate and glutamate respectively.0.8852426.06ND326-346YMPDEAMT 333PHISGTTIDAQLRbND, a peptide giving the computed mass could not be detected for either c"

Evidence has been presented that in this process superoxide radicals may be released, although their intermediacy never has been directly proven. In the present study, the autoxidation of H4B was reinvestigated with the aim to find direct evidence for superoxide formation. By means of two specific assays, namely elicitation of luminescence from lucigenin and ESR-spectrometric detection of the DEPMPO-OOH radical adduct, the release of free superoxide radicals was unequivocally demonstrated. The production of superoxide radicals was further corroborated by interaction with nitric oxide. The kinetics of the autoxidation process was established. Our data fully confirm earlier conclusions that the direct reaction between H4B and oxygen serves as an initiation reaction for the further, rapid reaction of the thus formed superoxide with H4B, thereby very likely establishing a chain reaction process involving reduction of molecular oxygen by the intermediary tetrahydrobiopterin radical. Conclusively, because H4B can per se induce oxidative stress, an in vivo overproduction of this pterin, as is evident in various diseases, may be responsible for the observed acceleration of pathophysiological pathways.

J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 230: 931-939Google Scholar) as well as for all three NOS isoforms (2Kwon N.S. Nathan C.F. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20496-20501Google Scholar, 3Mayer B. Hemmens B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 477-481Google Scholar, 4Tayeh M.A. Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19654-19658Google Scholar, 5Schmidt H.H.H.W. Poolock J.S. Förstermann U. Murad F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: A1591Google Scholar). At ambient temperature, H4B is not stable in the presence of molecular oxygen. In 1973, Fisher and Kaufman (6Fisher D.B. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4300-4304Google Scholar) noticed that the overall stoichiometry of the H2O2 yielding autoxidation of tetrahydrobiopterin, i.e. its spontaneous reaction with dioxygen, can in the presence of catalase be expressed as the following equation. 2H4B+O2→2H2B+2H2O(Eq. 1) Fisher and Kaufman (6Fisher D.B. Kaufman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4300-4304Google Scholar) additionally remarked that Cu,Zn-SOD inhibited autoxidation of H4B. One year later, Blair and Pearson (7Blair J.A. Pearson A.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin II. 1974; : 80-88Google Scholar, 8Pearson A.J. Chem. Ind. (Lond.). 1974; : 233-238Google Scholar) analyzed the autoxidation of H4B in more detail. From the verification of the intermediacy of a tetrahydropterin radical cation, H4B·+ (at acidic pH), as well as from oxygen uptake experiments they speculated about the presence of a radical chain reaction mechanism in which the initiation step should proceed via electron transfer from H4B to oxygen, followed by rapid proton transfer (Equation 2). H4B+O2→[HB.+,O2.−]→H3B.+HO2.(Eq. 2) H4B+HO2.→H3B.+H2O2 (Eq. 3) H3B.+O2→H2B+HO2.(Eq. 4) The following year, this mechanism was apparently proven by Nishikimi (9Nishikimi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 166: 273-279Google Scholar), who observed reduction of the O2·¯ scavenger nitro blue tetrazolium when the autoxidation of H4B was carried out at pH 7.4 in the presence of high amounts of Triton X-100. The conclusion of Nishikimi (9Nishikimi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 166: 273-279Google Scholar) was apparently supported by Heikkila and Cohen (10Heikkila R.E. Cohen G. Experientia. 1975; 31: 169-170Google Scholar), who reported that reduction of ferricytochrome c, a common assay for superoxide, took place during autoxidation of H4B. However, it should be noted that tetrahydrobiopterin directly reduces cytochrome c3+, with a rather high rate constant (k = 3.4 × 106m–1 s–1) (11Kwee S. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1987; 18: 79-89Google Scholar, 12Hasegawa H. Nakanishi N. Akino M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 499-506Google Scholar). Hence, H4B-dependent reduction of cytochrome c3+ cannot be used as evidence for the occurrence of reaction 2. Likewise, nitro blue tetrazolium reduction as applied by Nikishimi (9Nishikimi M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 166: 273-279Google Scholar) can only be regarded as a weak indication for the intermediacy of superoxide, because Liochev and Fridovich (13Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 408-410Google Scholar) noted that “nitro blue tetrazolium can mediate O2·¯ production in systems that would not otherwise produce O2·¯.” In this context, also a disagreement exists in the literature (11Kwee S. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1987; 18: 79-89Google Scholar, 12Hasegawa H. Nakanishi N. Akino M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 499-506Google Scholar) whether superoxide is formed by reaction 4. From their examination of the autoxidation of H4B models, methylated tetra- and dihydropterins, Bruice and co-workers (14Eberlein G. Bruice T.C. Lazarus R.A. Henrie R. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7916-7924Google Scholar) proposed that in the initial, rate-controlling electron-transfer step a ( H4B·+, O2·¯) radical pair should be produced, which instantaneously collapses to a hydroperoxide intermediate rather than releasing a superoxide/hydroperoxyl radical. The fact that no H2O2 formation could be detected apparently supported this hypothesis, however, the authors already noted that H2O2 could have been consumed by subsequent, direct reaction with the H4B model compounds. The idea that H4B directly reduces oxygen to O2·¯ was revived in 1993 when production of H2O2 was indeed monitored, but found to be partly inhibited by Cu,Zn-SOD (15Davies M.D. Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 9-16Google Scholar). Later, the capability of H4B to decrease nitric oxide levels in the presence of oxygen, and the observed inhibitory effect of Cu,Zn-SOD on this process, provided a further, strong argument for the intermediate release of O2·¯. during tetrahydrobiopterin autoxidation, thereby producing peroxynitrite (16Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Google Scholar). Taken together, the foregoing observations, especially with regard to the inhibitory effects of Cu,Zn-SOD, leave little doubt that O2·¯ is involved in the autoxidation of H4B and related compounds. However, in none of these papers was free O2·¯ directly and unequivocally identified. On the contrary, the proposal that H4B generates free O2·¯ from molecular oxygen was later disputed by Xia and Zweier (17Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12705-12710Google Scholar) because these authors were unable to detect the expected adduct of O2·¯ to the spin trap compound DMPO, DMPO–OOH, by ESR spectrometry. As H4B was found to react quite fast with O2·¯ (k = 3.9 × 105m–1 s–1) (18Vasquez-Vivar J. Whitsett J. Martasek P. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 975-985Google Scholar) it was referred to as a “superoxide scavenger.” As a consequence, the possibility that O2·¯ is non-enzymatically generated from reaction of H4B with dioxygen virtually vanished from the recent literature and its possible influence on the mechanisms of NOS activity is no longer discussed. In the present study, we therefore reinvestigated the autoxidation of H4B with the aim to bring this issue back to the mind of the scientific community and to get better insight in the reaction mechanism and kinetics. The intermediacy of free O2·¯ from reaction of H4B with molecular oxygen is unequivocally proven. We fully confirm earlier hypotheses that a slow, one-electron transfer from H4B to O2 very likely represents the initiation step for the consecutive, fast reaction of the thus formed O2·¯ with H4B, thereby setting up a chain process in which molecular oxygen is additionally converted to superoxide via reaction with the intermediary H3B• radical. Hence, H4B indeed acts both as superoxide generator and as superoxide scavenger (19Koshimura K. Murakami Y. Tanaka J. Kato Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 54: 664-672Google Scholar, 20Shimizu S. Ishii M. Kawakami Y. Momose K. Yamamoto T. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 1585-1592Google Scholar). Further experiments show that the so formed superoxide is available for reaction with simultaneously produced nitric oxide. Materials—Catalase from beef liver (EC 1.11.1.6) and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes (EC 1.15.1.1) were obtained from Roche Diagnostics. Lucigenin and hydrogen peroxide were from Sigma. DEPMPO, H4B, H2B, and sepiapterin were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (Schwalbach, Germany). Commercially available mixtures of oxygen 5.0 and nitrogen 5.0 (20.5% O2, 79.5% N2, “synthetic air”) and commercially available mixtures of oxygen 5.0, nitrogen 5.0, and carbon dioxide 4.6 (20.5% O2, 74.5% N2,5%CO2) were purchased from Messer-Griessheim (Oberhausen, Germany; 5.0 and 4.6 mean purities of 99.999 and 99.996%, respectively). All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. The program “Chemical Kinetics Simulator 1.01” was kindly donated by International Business Machines Corporation. 2www.almaden.ibm.com/st/msim. Solutions—Phosphate buffer solutions (50 mm) were treated with the heavy metal scavenger resin Chelex 100 (0.3 g in 10 ml) by gently shaking for 18 h in the dark. After low speed centrifugation for 5 min, the solutions were carefully decanted from the resin. The resin treatment resulted in an increase in pH by about 0.25 units. Various additives (Cu,Zn-SOD, DEPMPO, lucigenin, etc.) were then added. The pH was adjusted to 7.5 at 37 °C and the solutions were again bubbled (2 liters/min) with synthetic air or with the CO2 mixture for 20 min. In the case of CO2 bubbling, the pH had to be readjusted to 7.5. The pterins (H4B and H2B) and PAPA-NONOate were prepared as ×100 stock solutions at 4 °C in 200 mm HCl and 10 mm NaOH, respectively, and used within 15 min. Experimental Conditions—The experiments were performed in reaction tubes (2.0 ml, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) by using the drop-tube Vortex mixer technique as described previously (21Kirsch M. Lomonosova E.E. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. de Groot H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12716-12724Google Scholar). Determination of Tetrahydrobiopterin, Dihydrobiopterin, and Sepiapterin—Formation of H2B (ϵM = 6820 m–1 cm–1), H2P (ϵM = 5400 m–1 cm–1), and sepiapterin (ϵM = 1530 m–1 cm–1) were quantified spectrophotometrically at 330 nm (22Davies M.D. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 345-351Google Scholar) on a Specord S100 (Analytic Jena, Germany) diode array spectrometer. In control experiments H4B, H2B, and sepiapterin were additionally quantified by capillary zone electrophoresis on a Beckman P/ACE 5000 apparatus under the following conditions: fused silica capillary (60-cm effective length, 750μm internal diameter), hydrodynamic injection for 5 s, temperature 30 °C, voltage 18 kV, normal polarity, UV detection at 280 nm. As the electrolyte system a mixture of 20 mm sodium phosphate solution and H3PO4 (final pH 1.6) was used. To each sample 10 mm tryptophan (ϵM = 5600 m–1 cm–1) was added as internal standard. Determination of H2O2and of O2—Hydrogen peroxide was quantified by the amount of O2 released upon addition of catalase (1300 units/ml). O2 was determined polarographically with a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Saur, Reutlingen, Germany). The equilibrium concentration of molecular oxygen at “normoxic” conditions was determined for each of the experimental series and amounted rather constantly to 225 ± 5 μm. Determination of Nitric Oxide—Nitric oxide was quantified polarographically with a graphite nitric oxide-sensing electrode (World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany) or followed by fluorescence spectroscopy (FL 3095 diode array spectrometer, J&M, Aalen, Germany) after reaction with the fluorescence nitric oxide cheletropic trap FNOCT-1 as reported previously (23Meineke P. Rauen U. de Groot H. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. Chem. Eur. J. 1999; 5: 1738-1747Google Scholar, 24Meineke P. Rauen U. de Groot H. Korth H.-G. Sustmann R. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 575-582Google Scholar). Determination of Nitrate and Nitrite—The yields of nitrate and nitrite were quantified by the use of nitrate reductase in conjunction with the Griess assay. The Griess assay was carried out as described elsewhere (25Ioannidis I. de Groot H. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 341-345Google Scholar). Determination of Superoxide—Superoxide radical formation was established by using two independent methods. As a first method lucigenin-mediated luminescence was employed. Solutions of lucigenin (1 mm, pH 8, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 300 μl) were mixed with solutions of H4B (4 mm, 100 mm HCl, 5 μl). Light emission was followed with a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Germany) set to an integration time of 1 s. The second method for verification of superoxide formation was ESR spectrometry. ESR spectra were recorded at ambient temperature on a Bruker ESP-300E X-band spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany) equipped with a TM110 wide bore cavity. Solutions were prepared from 1 ml of the buffer solution (pH 7.4) containing DEPMPO (100 mm). H4B (1 mm) was added to the foregoing solution by vortexing under aerobic conditions. The reaction mixtures were quickly transferred to an aqueous solution quartz cell (Willmad, Buena, NJ). The first spectra were run as fast as possible, i.e. within 1 min, and then in 13-min intervals. Recording conditions: microwave frequency, 9.8 GHz; modulation, 0.04 millitesla; signal gain, 5 × 105; sweep range, 20 millitesla; sweep time, 4 min. Spectrum simulation was performed using the WinSim program (26Duling D.R. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 104: 105-110Google Scholar). Spectrum integration was carried out with the Bruker WinEPR software. Kinetic Simulations of Tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent Nitric Oxide Consumption—The kinetic simulations were performed with the “Chemical Kinetic Software (CKS)” (IBM, Almaden Research Center, San Jose, CA) and the Kintecus program written by Dr. James C. Ianni. 3J. C. Ianni, 2.80 Ed., www.kintecus.com. The CKS software uses a stochastic approach to calculate concentration-time profiles from given rate constants, whereas Kintecus performs numerical integrations of the rate laws. The virtues of the latter program are that it runs incredibly fast on a standard PC and is basically unrestricted in terms of the number of reactions and species. Furthermore, the program automatically checks for correct mass and charge balance and also offers the opportunity to modify the concentration of selected compounds at any point on the time scale. This feature easily allowed to model the effect of adding H4B to a solution where •NO is in situ generated by PAPA-NONOate in the presence of oxygen. Influence of Superoxide Dismutase on Tetrahydrobiopterin Autoxidation—Davies and Kaufman (15Davies M.D. Kaufman S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 9-16Google Scholar) reported that H2O2 is formed from autoxidation of H4B. In line with these findings 55.7 ± 5 μm H2O2 was found when 600 μm H4B was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in aerobic phosphate buffer solutions at pH 7.5 (three experiments performed in duplicate). As the formation of H2O2 should proceed at the expense of oxygen, oxygen uptake by H4B was followed in the presence of catalase (1300 units/liters) (to avoid possible oxidation of H4B by hydrogen peroxide (11Kwee S. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1987; 18: 79-89Google Scholar)), and the effect of Cu,Zn-SOD on oxygen uptake was studied (Fig. 1). In agreement with data of both Pearson (8Pearson A.J. Chem. Ind. (Lond.). 1974; : 233-238Google Scholar) as well as Heikkila and Cohen (10Heikkila R.E. Cohen G. Experientia. 1975; 31: 169-170Google Scholar), oxygen was consumed by H4B. In the absence of Cu,Zn-SOD oxygen consumption proceeded with an apparent half-life of 8.4 min. Addition of Cu,Zn-SOD (500 units/ml) decreased H4B-dependent O2 consumption by about 83%, corresponding to an apparent half-life of 50.3 min. Because the addition of Cu,Zn-SOD abolished the consecutive reaction between superoxide and tetrahydrobiopterin, the upper trace of Fig. 1 should reflect the overall rate constant for the oxidation of H4B, obeying the stoichiometry of reaction 1 under these conditions. 2H4B+O2→2H2B+2H2O(Eq. 5) The rate constant for reaction of H4B with O2 was estimated from kinetic simulation with the CKS software employing the reactions displayed in Table I by systematically varying the rate constants of entries 1 and 2 (Table I).Table IKinetic scheme for the simulation of oxygen consumption by tetrahydrobiopterin in the absence and presence of Cu,Zn-SODEntryReactionk/M-1/S-1Ref.1H3B.+O2→qH2B+O2.−+H+3.2 (± 0.3) × 103This work2H4B+O2→H3B.+O2.−+H+0.60 (± 0.03)This work3H4B+O2.−+H+→H3B.+H2O23.9 × 10518Vasquez-Vivar J.

This value is in very good agreement with the value 1.44 ± 0.18 m–1 s–1 as determined by Mayer et al. (16Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Google Scholar) for the conversion of H4B, which according to the stoichiometry of Equation 1 is twice as fast as the consumption of oxygen. The estimated rate constant k(entry 1) = of about 3 × 103m–1 s–1 for superoxide formation from reaction of the intermediary H3B• radical with oxygen appears reasonable for this type of compound (28von Sonntag C. Schuchmann H.P. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1229-1253Google Scholar). Eberlein et al. (14Eberlein G. Bruice T.C. Lazarus R.A. Henrie R. Benkovic S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 7916-7924Google Scholar) estimated values of k(entry 2)′ < 2.1 and k(entry 1)′ < 503 m–1 s–1 for the corresponding rate constants of the H4B model compound 6,6,7,7-tetramethyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin. Because carbon-centered radicals generally react close to diffusion control with O2 (28von Sonntag C. Schuchmann H.P. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1991; 30: 1229-1253Google Scholar), rate constant k(entry 1) thus represents the overall process of the following reaction (Equation 6). H3B.+O2=H3BOO.→qH2B+O2.−+H+(Eq. 6) To further substantiate the inhibitory effect of superoxide dismutase toward tetrahydrobiopterin autoxidation, the accumulated formation of the various pterin-type products, i.e. sepiapterin, H2B, and dihydropterin (H2P), was monitored spectrophotometrically at 330 nm (where all products significantly absorb) (22Davies M.D. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 345-351Google Scholar) in the absence and presence of Cu,Zn-SOD. Formation of the various pterins from autoxidation of 20 μm H4B increased with increasing incubation time in an exponential manner (Fig. 2), with an apparent pseudo-first order rate constant of (6.6 ± 0.1) × 10–4 s–1. Addition of Cu,Zn-SOD (100 units/ml) inhibited H4B autoxidation by a factor of five. From the pseudo-first order rate constant of (1.36 ± 0.05) × 10–4 s–1 and an oxygen concentration of 225 μm, a rate constant of 0.60 ± 0.02 m–1 s–1 was derived, in excellent agreement with the above oxygen uptake experiments. As the formation of H2B from autoxidation of H4B was sometimes questioned (29Armarego W.L.F. Randles D. Taguchi H. Eur. J.

(22Davies M.D. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 345-351Google Scholar), H2B was produced during autoxidation of H4B. At longer incubation periods sepiapterin was additionally produced, at the expense of H2B. H2P accounted for the mass balance difference (about 45%), but was not independently quantified. Plots of the data of Table IIversus time (data not shown) showed an apparent exponential behavior for the decrease of H4B and the formation of H2B + H2P + sepiapterin, respectively, with a half-life of 12.8 min under these conditions. With regard to the lower H4B concentration compared with the conditions of Fig. 1, this half-life is in good agreement with the half-life of oxygen uptake. The observation that 56% of the consumed H4B was oxidized to H2B points to the intermediacy of the quinonoid form of dihydrobiopterin, qH2B, because Davies et al. (22Davies M.D. Kaufman S. Milstien S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 345-351Google Scholar) found that this intermediate (t½ = 1–2 min) isomerizes under similar experimental conditions with a yield of 55.1% to H2B. The inhibitory action of Cu,Zn-SOD was not further significantly increased by increasing its activity 10-fold, and H4B was found to be stable under oxygen-free (hypoxic) conditions (data not shown). Combined, the foregoing observations strongly indicated that free superoxide is formed from direct reaction of H4B and molecular oxygen and that the initially formed superoxide further accelerated autoxidation of H4B by a factor of 5 to 6.Table IIYield of dihydrobiopterin from autoxidation of tetrahydrobiopterinTimeH4BConsumedH2BSepiapterinYieldaYield (%) = ((H2B + sepiapterin) / consumed) × 100.minμM%0329.8 ± 160.00.0 ± 00.0 ± 007228.4 ± 11101.456.9 ± 60.0 ± 05615144.7 ± 7185.1102.9 ± 110.0 ± 05620108.1 ± 1221.7102.1 ± 819.9 ± 456a Yield (%) = ((H2B + sepiapterin) / consumed) × 100. Open table in a new tab Consumption of Nitric Oxide by Tetrahydrobiopterin/Oxygen—Mayer and co-workers (16Mayer B. Klatt P. Werner E.R. Schmidt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 655-659Google Scholar) have reported that nitric oxide is consumed by H4B in the presence of molecular oxygen and attributed this correctly to the intermediacy of peroxynitrite. In this case nitrate and nitrite plus O2 must be produced, their relative yields strongly varying with pH around pH 7.5 (Equations 7,8,9) (30Pfeiffer S. Gorren A.C.F. Schmidt K. Werner E.R.

The decrease of the level of nitric oxide after addition of H4B proceeded in a biphasic manner, implying that two kinetically different •NO consuming routes are followed under the applied experimental conditions. To check on this, the concentration-time profiles were simulated with the Kintecus program by employing the reactions collected in Table III. Despite the large number of reactions, the H4B-dependent uptakes of nitric oxide are excellently reproduced (Fig. 3B). Thus, the consumption of •NO can be satisfactorily explained by the intermediary action of superoxide. In line with this conclusion, the H4B-dependent decrease of the •NO concentration was largely abolished in the presence of 5000 units/ml Cu,Zn-SOD (data not shown), in full agreement with observations reported by Mayer et al.

https://openalex.org/W2172132882,"Early studies suggested that the signature motif, LXXLL, within steroid hormone receptor p160 coregulators may play important roles for the mediation of receptor-coregulator interaction. Interestingly, several androgen receptor (AR) coregulators, such as ARA70 and ARA55, may not use such a unique motif to mediate their coregulator activity. Here we apply the phage display technique to identify some new signature motifs, (F/W)XXL(F/W) and FXXLY (where F is phenylalanine, W is tryptophan, L is leucine, Y is tyrosine, and X is any amino acid) that can influence the interaction between AR and AR coregulators. Sequence analyses found that several AR coregulators, such as ARA70, ARA55, ARA54, and FHL2, contain FXXL(F/Y) motifs. Both glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and transient transfection reporter assays demonstrate that these AR coregulators may use the FXXL(F/Y) motif to interact with AR and exert their AR coregulator activity. Exchanging the amino acid of Phe, Trp, or Tyr in this newly identified signature motif cluster may influence these peptides to interact with AR. The motif-containing peptides, as well as ARA70 or ARA54, may require selective flanking sequences for the better interaction with AR. In addition to influencing the AR transactivation, these motifs in AR-interacting peptides/proteins were also able to influence the AR N-/C-terminal interaction. Together, our data suggest that AR interacting peptides and/or AR coregulators may utilize the (F/W)XXL(F/W) and FXXLY motifs to mediate their interaction with AR and exert their influences on the AR transactivation.

Such changes cause AR to dissociate from chaperone proteins, become phosphorylated, move into the nucleus, and act as a dimer to bind to target gene-response elements. AR may also recruit some coregulators to bridge between the AR dimer and preinitiation transcriptional complex and enhance target gene transcription (6Keller E.T. Ershler W.B. Chang C. Front.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3158-3171Google Scholar).The precise repertoire between coregulator complex and SRs is still not clear. The most well studied coregulators are those of the p160 family, which are common SR coregulators. By aligning their amino acid sequences, these p160 coregulators are shown to share a common sequence containing the core consensus LXXLL motif (L is leucine and X is any amino acid) (24Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Google Scholar, 25Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G.

Through site-directed mutagenesis, this motif is shown to be essential for the function of coregulators in a ligand-dependent manner, and their flanking sequences could help to differentiate the specificity of their preferred receptor. In addition, some LXXLL motifs are essential to bind to common coregulators such as CBP/p300 (27McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Google Scholar). In co-crystal structure studies between NCoA-1/SRC-1 nuclear receptor interaction domain and liganded peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, two consecutive LXXLL motifs of the coregulator fragment bridge the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ dimer with each LXXLL motif binding to one peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ LBD (9Nolte R.T.

Because the LBDs of SRs share a highly conserved structure, many known coregulators have this LXXLL motif and use it for interaction with SRs (26Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Google Scholar, 27McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V.

However, we found that the LXXLL motif in some AR coregulators, such as ARA70, may not play important roles for the mediation of the AR-AR coregulator interaction (29Heinlein C.A. Ting H.J. Yeh S. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16147-16152Google Scholar, 30Heinlein C.A. Chang C. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 175-200Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesize that other signature motifs may exist that can play important roles for the AR-AR coregulator interaction.The phage display screening system is a selection system in which a peptide or protein is fused to the coat protein of a bacteriophage (31Parmley S.F.

Rat AR (rAR) amino acid sequence has 100% homology with human AR (hAR) in the DNA-binding domain (DBD) and LBD and 85% homology in the hinge region (2Chang C.S. Kokontis J. Liao S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7211-7215Google Scholar), but the rAR-DBD-LBD expressed from Escherichia coli was more stable than hAR-DBD-LBD. Through the phage display method and using E. coli-expressed rAR-DBD-LBD protein in the presence of testosterone, we fished out some AR-interacting peptides. Further classification allowed us to find some new motif clusters that might play important roles for the mediation of the interaction between AR and AR-interacting peptides.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Plasmids—5α-Dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT), testosterone, 1,25(OH)2D3, and estradiol were obtained from Sigma. PhD-12™ peptide library was purchased from New England Biolabs. pSG5-AR and pSG5-ARA70N (ARA70 N terminus, amino acids 1– 401) were constructed as described previously (37Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Google Scholar). FHL2 (full-length and fragments) was cloned from cDNA library of immortal human prostate epithelial cell line HPR-1 (a gift from Dr. Franky Chan, Chinese University of Hong Kong) and was constructed into pSG5 and pGEX-GST vector. pCMX-VP16-AR (AR lacking the initial 37 amino acids) was constructed for mammalian two-hybrid assay (37Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Google Scholar). The pCMX-VP16-hERα, pCMX-VP16-VDR, and pCMX-GAL4-RXRα constructs were generated by PCR of the full-length human ERα, VDR, and RXRα cDNA with primers containing EcoRI and BamHI sites for hERα and VDR and EcoRI and NheI sites for RXRα flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends, and the resulting PCR products were subcloned into the EcoRI and BamHI/NheI sites of pCMX-VP16 or pCMX-GAL4-DBD vectors.pGEX-GST-ARA70N, pGEX-GST-ARA55, and pGEX-GST-ARA54 constructs were generated by PCR of pSG5-ARA70, pSG5-ARA55, and pSG5-ARA54 with one primer containing BamHI site flanking the 5′ end, and the other primer containing EcoRI site flanking the 3′ end, and the resulting PCR products were subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the pGEX-GST vector. pGEX-GST-HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) construct was generated by PCR of the full-length human HSP90 cDNA with primers containing BglII site flanking the 5′ and 3′ ends, and the PCR product was inserted into pGEX-GST vector via BamHI site. Site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create single and double amino acid mutations in FXXL(F/Y) domain of ARA70-N, FHL2, and ARA54-C (amino acids 361– 474). The target peptides sequences for wild type (wt) and mutants (mts) were synthesized by two 35-mer oligonucleotides with 15 central complementary nucleotides (IDTDNA) filled in by Klenow enzyme with dNTP and constructed into pCMX-GAL4 vector between EcoRI and BamHI sites. Peptide D30 from a sequence published previously (38Chang C.Y. McDonnell D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 647-660Google Scholar) was synthesized by two complementary oligonucleotides (IDTDNA) and was constructed into pCMX-GAL4 vector between EcoRI and BamHI sites. PCR was used to construct AR-N (amino acids 1–501) via BamHI/KpnI to pCDNA3-FLAG vector and AR-C (amino acids 556 –919) via BamHI/XbaI into pCDNA3 vector.Cell Cultures—COS-1, CV-1 cell lines (both are green monkey kidney cell lines), and human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (25 units/ml), and streptomycin (25 μg/ml). All cell lines were from ATCC.Cloning, Expression, and Purification of the rAR-DBD-LBD—The rAR-DBD-LBD cDNA, from amino acids 538 –902 (rat numbering), was cloned from a rat prostate cDNA library (Clontech) by PCR. The rAR-DBD-LBD was expressed as a fusion protein driven by the T7 promoter of pET28c vector (Novagen) to include an N-terminal polyhistidine tag and a thrombin cleavage site. Testosterone was included in the E. coli (BL21-DE3) fermentation medium at a concentration of 1 μm. Induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was allowed to proceed for 16 h at 18 °C in NZCYM media, and pellets were stored at –70 °C. With a total of ∼80% purity, 4 –5 mg of recombinant rAR-DBD-LBD protein was isolated from a 15-g cell pellet after freezing/thawing for four cycles, sonicating, chromatography on a nickel-chelate resin, and elution by 0.25 m imidazole.Phage Display Procedure—Detailed procedures for panning and sequencing of peptide have been described previously (31Parmley S.F. Smith G.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1989; 251: 215-218Google Scholar, 32Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Google Scholar). Briefly, 150 μl of 100 μg/ml streptavidin in NaHCO3 solution, pH 8.6, was coated on the wells of a 96-well enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate (Corning Glass) at 4 °C for 18 h, blocked with 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.6, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h; we then added 30 pmol of biotin-labeled C3(1)-ARE (Biotin-C3(1)ARE1, 5′-Bio-GATC CAG AGT ACG TGA TGT TCT CAG; Biotin-C3(1)ARE2, 5′-Bio-GATC CTG AGA ACA TCA CGT ACT ATG) in TBST solution (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) to the coated well for 1 h, then added 20 pmol of rAR-DBD-LBD protein in TBST solution, and incubated for 1 h. Between each step, wells were washed with TBST 10 times. Finally, we added 1.5 × 1011 phage in 100 μl of TBST with 1 μm testosterone to the coated well, incubated for another 1 h, and then washed out unbound phage. We used 0.2 m glycine HCl, pH 2.2, to elute the bound phage and neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.1. Eluted phage was amplified in E. coli (ER2738). The whole procedure was repeated for four rounds, and the phage peptides from the third and fourth rounds were sequenced.Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—For the luciferase assay, 300 ng of pG5-LUC reporter gene plasmid, 0.5 ng of SV40-Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid, 350 ng of wt or mt coregulator or peptide in pCMX-GAL4 vector, and 350 ng of VP16-AR were transfected into PC-3 cells with Superfect kit (Qiagen). After 16 h, ethanol, 1 nm 5α-DHT, or 10 nm testosterone were added to the wells for another 16 h. The dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was employed to measure luciferase activity.Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—COS-1 and CV-1 cell lines and human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection, the cells were plated in 24-well dishes, and plasmids were transfected by Superfect kit as described previously. After 16 h of incubation, the cells were treated with ethanol or steroid hormones for another 16 h and then harvested for the dual luciferase assay. The mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-luciferase reporter gene was used to measure AR transcriptional activity, and an SV40-Renilla luciferase plasmid (Promega) was used as an internal control. The dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) was employed to measure the luciferase activity.Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assay—GST-ARA70-N and GST-FHL2 fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 and purified as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were suspended in 100 μl of interaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol), mixed with 5 μl of 35S-labeled TnT-expressed hAR full-length proteins (TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) in the presence or absence of 1 μm 5α-DHT, and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. After several washes with NENT buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 8% glycerol), the bound proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).RESULTSScreening of the Unique Motif That Interacts with AR—To identify whether any new signature motif can bind and enhance AR transactivation, we applied phage display library containing 1012 random 12-amino acid peptides to screen its ability to bind to AR. By using E. coli-expressed rAR-DBD-LBD protein with testosterone as bait to screen four times with 12-mers random peptide library, we were able to identify a set of AR-interacting peptides containing a motif cluster with sequences of either (F/W)XXL(F/W) or FXXLY that can interact with rAR. Structure analysis found these three amino acids, Phe, Trp, and Tyr, all belong to the same functional group with bulky, hydrophobic, neutral, and aromatic ring-containing side chains. We also found one peptide containing the classic LXXLL motif in our screening. The synthetic DNA encoding these individual peptides were subcloned into expression vectors to test if they can still interact with hAR in the mammalian two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 1A, at least 12 peptides containing either (F/W)XXL(F/W) or FXXLY motif can interact with hAR (with at least 5-fold induction in the presence of androgen). Mammalian two-hybrid assay further demonstrates these peptides can bind specifically to AR but not ERα or vitamin D receptor (VDR) (Fig. 1B). Together, these data suggest that in addition to the classic LXXLL motif, a new motif, such as (F/W)XXL(F/W) or FXXLY, may be able to bind specifically to AR.Identification of FXXLF Signature Motif in AR and AR Coregulators ARA70, ARA55, ARA54, and FHL2, WXXLF Motif in AR and FXXLY Motif in FHL2—We then surveyed the amino acid sequence within AR and AR coregulators identified previously, and we found that AR had the (F/W)XXLF motifs; ARA70 (37Yeh S. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5517-5521Google Scholar), ARA55 (39Fujimoto N. Yeh S. Kang H.Y. Inui S. Chang H.C. Mizokami A. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8316-8321Google Scholar), and ARA54 (40Kang H.Y. Yeh S. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8570-8576Google Scholar) contained the FXXLF motif, and FHL2 (41Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Google Scholar) contained both the FXXL(F/Y) motifs (Fig. 2A). After aligning these motifs, we found that the motifs in both ARA55 and FHL2, which were Lin11, Isl-1, and Mec-3 (LIM) domain-containing proteins, were located in the linkers or just next to the LIMs.Fig. 2Effect of FXXLF motif in AR-HSP90 interaction and effects of FXXL(F/Y) motifs in AR-FXXL(F/Y) motifs-containing AR interaction protein interactions.A, FXXLF motif exists in AR, ARA70, ARA55, ARA54, and FHL2. WXXLF motif exists in AR. FXXLY motif was found in FHL2. The FXXL(F/Y) motifs in LIMs proteins ARA55 and FHL2 were located in the linkers or close to the LIMs. B, mutation of the FXXLF motif to AXXAA in AR N terminus reduced AR interaction with HSP90 in GST pull-down assay. The GST-HSP90 and GST control proteins were purified as instructed by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Five microliters of in vitro translated wild type (wt) or mutant type (mt) [35S]methionine-labeled hAR interacted with GST-HSP90 protein or GST control bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in a pull-down assay as described in the presence or absence of 1 μm 5α-DHT. After extensive washing, the pull-down complex was loaded onto an 8 or 10% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. The input represents 10% of the amount of labeled protein used in the pull-down assay. C–G, mutations in these FXXL(F/Y) motifs will cause weaker AR-AR interaction protein interactions. Similar experimental procedures were done as in B except using wt [35S]methionine-labeled hAR only and substituting GST-HSP90 with wt or mt, full-length, or fragment of GST-AR coregulators.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)(F/W)XXLF in AR has been shown to be important for mediating AR N-C interaction (43He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Google Scholar, 44He B. Bowen N.T. Minges J.T. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42293-42301Google Scholar). Mutation or deletion of the FXXLF motif in the AR N terminus could not influence [3H]R1881 binding to AR significantly (Kd: 0.3– 0.8 nm) (43He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Google Scholar) or AR binding to specific or nonspecific response element (49Callewaert L. Verrijdt G. Christiaens V. Haelens A. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8212-8218Google Scholar). We first tested whether this FXXLF motif had any effect on AR-HSP90 interaction. As shown in Fig. 2B, the data from GST pull-down assay show the mutation of the FXXLF in AR N terminus will weaken the AR-HSP90 interaction.Among AR coregulators, we first mutated the FXXLF motif in ARA70 to AXXAA (where A is alanine) and the FXXL(F/Y) motifs in FHL2 to AXXA(A/A), and we tested their influence on the binding to AR. Interestingly, results from GST pull-down assay show that wt ARA70N-FXXLF can interact well with AR. In contrast, mt ARA70N-AXXAA has little capacity to interact with AR (Fig. 2C). Similar results also occurred in ARA55, ARA54, and FHL2 showing only wt but not mt AR coregulators can interact with AR (Fig. 2, D–G). Together, results from Fig. 2 clearly demonstrated that the signature motif FXXLF in AR was important in AR-HSP90 interaction, and signature motifs, FXXLF and FXXLY, identified from phage display screening may represent new motifs among the AR coregulators, such as ARA70, ARA55, ARA54, and FHL2.FXXL(F/Y) Signature Motifs in AR Coregulators Influence AR Transactivation—The coregulator-ARA70N containing wt FXXLF and mt AXXAA were then ligated to pSG5 expression vector and tested for their influence on the AR transactivation. As shown in Fig. 3A, in COS-1 cells, 10 nm 5α-DHT can induce AR transactivation to 8-fold (lanes 1 versus 2). Addition of wt pSG5-ARA70N-FXXLF further enhances AR transactivation from 8- to 310-fold (lanes 2 versus 3). In contrast, addition of mt pSG5-ARA70N-AXXAA only shows much less induction effect (from 8- to 25-fold) for AR transactivation (lanes 2 versus 4). Because FHL2 has one FXXLF motif and one FXXLY motif, we mutated both of these motifs to AXXAA and tested their influence on the AR transactivation. As expected, we found the mt FHL2-AXXA(A/A) has much less induction effect on AR transactivation (Fig. 3B). Together, Fig. 3 demonstrates that a newly identified FXXL(F/Y) motif not only influences the interaction between AR and AR coregulator but may also influence the AR coregulator activity.Fig. 3Effects of wt and mt FXXL(F/Y) motifs-containing AR interaction proteins on AR transactivation. Both ARA70-N (A) and FHL2 (B) were transfected in COS-1 cells. In COS-1 cells, 100 ng of pSG5-hAR, 600 ng of wt pSG5-ARA70-N-FXXLF, mt pSG5-ARA70-N-AXXAA, wt pSG5-FHL2-FXXL(F/Y), or mt pSG5-FHL2-AXXA(A/A), 300 ng of MMTV-LUC reporter plasmid, and 0.5 ng of SV40-Renilla luciferase plasmid were transfected in 24-well plates. After 16 h, ethanol or 10 nm 5α-DHT were added for another 16 h. Relative LUC activity was calculated by the dual luciferase system.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Interchanging of Phe, Trp, and Tyr in the Motifs May Influence the Peptide to Interact with AR—Because the three specific amino acids, Phe, Trp, and Tyr have similar bulky, hydrophobic, neutral, and aromatic ring-containing side chains, we hypothesized that these three amino acids may be exchangeable in some peptides. Among the identified peptides, we picked up peptide 3-18 with the FXXLF motif and peptide 4-9 with the WXXLF motif, and we performed single mutations each time. We changed the first amino acid Phe of peptide 3-18 to Trp (m1) or to Tyr (m2), or we changed the second amino acid Phe to Trp (m3) or to Tyr (m4). We also changed the first amino acid Trp of peptide 4-9 to Phe (m1), or we changed the first amino acid Phe to Trp (m2) or to Tyr (m3). These mt and wt peptides were then tested for their interactions with AR in mammalian two-hybrid assay. In peptide 3-18, the first amino acid Phe is not exchangeable, but the second amino acid Phe can be changed with Tyr although its interaction with AR is significantly reduced (Fig. 4). To our surprise, in the mt peptide 4-9 (m1), the changing of Trp to Phe can further enhance the peptide interaction with AR by 20-fold. The changing of Phe to Trp (m2) in peptide 4-9 had similar interaction with AR. Taken together, the data in Fig. 4 demonstrated that these three specific amino acids, Phe, Trp, and Tyr, within the newly identified motifs could not always be interchangeable, and the interchange of Phe, Trp, and Tyr in the motifs may influence the peptide to interact with AR, although the change of the first Phe to Trp did not influence the interaction between mutant peptide and AR in peptide 4-9, and exchanging the first Trp to Phe can further enhance mutant peptide 4-9-AR interaction.Fig. 4Interchanging of Phe, Trp, and Tyr in the motifs may influence the peptide interaction with AR. FXXLF-containing peptide 3-18 and WXXLF-containing peptide 4-9 were chosen. In peptide 3-18, the first amino acid Phe was changed to Trp (m1) or Tyr (m2), or the second amino acid Phe was mutated to Trp (m3) or Tyr (m4). In peptide 4-9, the first amino acid Trp was mutated to Phe (m1), or the first amino acid Phe was changed to Trp (m2) or Tyr (m3). In 24-well plates, 350 ng of VP16-hAR and 350 ng of GAL4-DBD or GAL4-DBD constructed with wt or mt peptides"
https://openalex.org/W2055239122,"Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). The N-terminal fragment of AR containing the expanded polyglutamine tract aggregates in cytoplasm and/or in nucleus and induces cell death. Some chaperones such as Hsp40 and Hsp70 have been identified as important regulators of polyglutamine aggregation and/or cell death in neuronal cells. Recently, Hsp105α, expressed at especially high levels in mammalian brain, has been shown to suppress apoptosis in neuronal cells and prevent the aggregation of protein caused by heat shock in vitro. However, its role in polyglutamine-mediated cell death and toxicity has not been studied. In the present study, we examined the effects of Hsp105α on the aggregation and cell toxicity caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract using a cellular model of SBMA. The transient expression of truncated ARs (tARs) containing an expanded polyglutamine tract caused aggregates to form in COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells and concomitantly apoptosis in the cells with the nuclear aggregates. When Hsp105α was overexpressed with tAR97 in the cells, Hsp105α was colocalized to aggregates of tAR97, and the aggregation and cell toxicity caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract were markedly reduced. Both β-sheet and α-helix domains, but not the ATPase domain, of Hsp105α were necessary to suppress the formation of aggregates in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Hsp105α was found to localize in nuclear inclusions formed by ARs containing an expanded polyglutamine tract in tissues of patients and transgenic mice with SBMA. These findings suggest that overexpression of Hsp105α suppresses cell death caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract without chaperone activity, and the enhanced expression of the essential domains of Hsp105α in brain may provide an effective therapeutic approach for CAG repeat diseases.

In SBMA patients, a normally polymorphic CAG repeat (10–36 CAGs) in exon 1 of the androgen receptor (AR) gene expands to 40–62 CAGs (3La Spada A.R. Wilson E.M. Lubahn D.B. Harding A.E. Fischbeck K.H.

All of these disorders show a late onset of neurological symptoms with progressive neuronal dysfunction and eventual neuronal loss, although the susceptible regions in the nervous system differ among the various disorders. The appearance of intranuclear aggregates/inclusions in neurons is associated with these neurodegenerative diseases. The intranuclear inclusions contain the insoluble protein aggregates of abnormal proteins or their fragments, heat shock proteins, and components of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome degradation pathway (16Welch W.J. Gambetti P. Nature. 1998; 392: 23-24Google Scholar, 17Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Google Scholar). Although the nature of the toxic insult of a polyglutamine mutation and its cell-biological consequences in each disease are unclear, it is possible that the polyglutamine expansion interferes with basic cellular processes such as transcription, protein degradation, and survival/death signaling (17Sherman M.Y. Goldberg A.L. Neuron. 2001; 29: 15-32Google Scholar). However, the exact role of these protein aggregates in polyglutamine pathology is still controversial because large polyglutamine aggregates may provide an advantage over small oligomers by exposing less potentially dangerous protein surfaces (18Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Google Scholar). The cellular components involved in protein folding and degradation are also associated with intracellular inclusions in other neurodegenerative diseases not caused by polyglutamine expansion, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and the prion diseases (19Schulz J.B. Dichgans J. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 1999; 12: 433-439Google Scholar), which suggests that common mechanistic principles may underlie these misfolding diseases in general. A considerable effort has been made to find molecules that suppress polyglutamine aggregation and cell death/toxicity for therapeutic purposes (20Heiser V. Scherzinger E. Boeddrich A. Nordhoff E.

In general, the misfolding and aggregation of proteins are prevented by molecular chaperones (23Hendricks J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Google Scholar, 24Hartl F.U.

However, because Hsp70/40 and Hsp27 suppressed polyglutamine-mediated death without suppressing polyglutamine aggregation in some experimental systems (35Wyttenbach A. Sauvageot O. Carmichael J.

Bull. 1998; 21: 905-910Google Scholar). Recently, Hsp105α was demonstrated to have antiapoptotic properties for neuronal survival (44Hatayama T. Yamagishi N. Minobe E. Sakai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 528-534Google Scholar). Furthermore, Hsp105α prevents the aggregation of thermal denatured protein in vitro (45Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Google Scholar). However, its role in polyglutamine-mediated cell death/toxicity has not been studied. In the present study, we examined the role of Hsp105α in the context of polyglutamine aggregation and cell death using a cellular model of SBMA and demonstrate that Hsp105α without chaperone activity protects cells against polyglutamine-mediated cell death by reducing polyglutamine-protein aggregation. These findings suggest an important role for Hsp105α in preventing neurodegenerative diseases associated with polyglutamine expansions. Plasmids—We used constructs expressing the N-terminal fragment of the AR fused to green fluorescence protein (GFP) containing 24, 65, or 97 CAG repeats (tAR24, tAR65, and tAR97, respectively) as a cellular model of SBMA (29Kobayashi Y. Kume A. Li M. Doyu M. Hata M. Ohtsuka K. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8772-8778Google Scholar), human Hsp70 (pCMV-Hsp70) (46Michels A.A. Kanon B. Konings A.W.T. Ohtsuka K. Bensaude O. Kampinga H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33283-33289Google Scholar), and Hsp40 (pRC-Hsp40) (29Kobayashi Y. Kume A. Li M. Doyu M. Hata M. Ohtsuka K. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8772-8778Google Scholar) in mammalian cells. The constructs expressing Hsp105α (pcDNA105α) and Myc-epitope/His-tagged Hsp105α (pcDNA105α-mycHis) in mammalian cells were generated by ligating a full-length mouse Hsp105α cDNA (38Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol.

The constructs expressing Hsp105N1–N3, Δβ, ΔL, and ΔβL in mammalian cells were generated by self-ligation of DNA made by PCR using pcDNA105α-mycHis (Hsp105N1–N3) or pcDNA105α (Hsp105Δβ, ΔL, ΔβL, and C1–C3) as template DNA and a specific set of primers (Table I).Table IPrimers used for construction of expression plasmids for Hsp105α deletion mutantsExpression in mammallan cellHsp105N1 (a.a. 1-392)Sense: 5′-CGGAGAAAGAATTGCACACTG-3′Antisense: 5′-TCTAGAGGGCCCTTCGAACAA-3′Hsp105N2 (a.a. 1-511)Sense: 5′-GGGGTACCCAGCCATGTCGGTGGTT-3′Antisense: 5′-TCTAGAGGGCCCTTCGAACAA-3′Hsp105N3 (a.a. 1-606)Sense: 5′-TAACTGCCATACCAAGTTGGC-3′Antisense: 5′-TCTAGAGGGCCCTTCGAACAA-3′Hsp105C1 (a.a. 605-858)Sense: 5′-GGGGATCCACCATGCTCGAGGCAGACATGGAATGT-3′Antisense: 5′-GCTCTAGACCTAGTCCAGGTCCATGTTGAC-3′Hsp105C2 (a.a. 511-858)Sense: 5′-GGGGATCCACCATGCTCGAGGCAGACATGGAATGT-3′Antisense: 5′-GCTCTAGACCTAGTCCAGGTCCATGTTGAC-3′Hsp105C3 (a.a. 386-858)Sense: 5′-GGGGATCCACCATGCCGGCATTTAAAGTTAGAGAG-3′Antisense: 5′-GCTCTAGACCTAGTCCAGGTCCATGTTGAC-3′Hsp105Δβ (a.a. 1-392 + a.a. 551-858)Sense: 5′-CTCGAGGCAGACATGGAATGTCCA-3′Antisense: 5′-AGAAAGAATTGCACACTGCAGTGCAC-3′Hsp105ΔβL (a.a. 1-392 + a.a. 605-858)Sense: 5′-GGGAGAGACCTTCTTAACATGTATATTG-3′Antisense: 5′-AGAAAGAATTGCACACTGCAGTGCAC-3′Hsp105ΔL (a.a. 1-511 + a.a. 605-858)Sense: 5′-GGGAGAGACCTTCTTAACATGTATATTG-3′Antisense: 5′-AGAGGAGCCATCCTCTTCCTCGGT-3′Expression in bacterial cellHsp105ΔβSense: 5′-CTCGAGGCAGACATGGAATGTCCA-3′Antisense: 5′-AGAAAGAATTGCACACTGCAGTGCAC-3′Hsp105ΔβLSense: 5′-GGGAGAGACCTTCTTAACATGTATATTG-3′Antisense: 5′-AGAAAGAATTGCACACTGCAGTGCAC-3′Hsp105ΔLSense: 5′-GGGAGAGACCTTCTTAACATGTATATTG-3′Antisense: 5′-AGAGGAGCCATCCTCTTCCTCGGT-3′ Open table in a new tab We used a construct expressing GST- and HA-tagged tAR65 (GST-tAR65-HA) in bacterial cells (47Merry D.E. Kobayashi Y. Bailey C.K. Taye A.A. Fischbeck K.H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 693-701Google Scholar). The constructs expressing HSP105α deletion mutants in bacterial cells were generated by ligating insert DNA made by PCR using pTrcHis105-1 (45Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Google Scholar) as a template DNA and a specific set of primers (Table I) into pTrcHisA vector (Invitrogen) at the KpnI site. Cell Culture and Transfection—African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) and human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH) were supplied from Riken cell bank. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Nissui Pharmaceutical) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SK-N-SH cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection of plasmid DNA, cells were grown on coverslips to 70–80% confluence and washed twice with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Then plasmid DNA was transfected into cells with DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) for 14–18 h, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Indirect Immunofluorescence—COS-7 cells grown on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS(–)) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. These cells were washed with PBS(–) and incubated with blocking solution containing 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS(–) at room temperature for 1 h. Then rabbit anti-human Hsp105 (48Honda K. Hatayama T. Yukioka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 60-66Google Scholar) or mouse anti-Hsp70 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) at a 1:300 dilution was added to the coverslips and incubated in a moist chamber at 37 °C for 1 h. After a wash with PBS(–), rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes) at a 1:50 dilution was added to the coverslips, and they were incubated further at 37 °C for 1 h. After another wash with PBS(–), cells were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss). Analysis of Aggregation in Vivo—COS-7 cells transfected with expression plasmid for tAR24, tAR65, or tAR97 were washed with PBS(–) and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. Cells on coverslips were washed with PBS(–) and stained with 10 μm Hoechst 33342 for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS(–) and then examined using a confocal laser scanning microscope. The number of transfected cells with visible aggregates and the number of transfected cells without aggregates were counted independently in randomly chosen microscopic fields in different areas of a coverslip. Approximately 300–600 transfected cells were analyzed for data in each experiment. Detection of the Apoptotic Cells—The apoptotic cells were identified by their nuclear morphology and the terminal nucleotidyl transferase-mediated UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method (29Kobayashi Y. Kume A. Li M. Doyu M. Hata M. Ohtsuka K. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8772-8778Google Scholar). Nuclear morphology was examined by staining with Hoechst 33342. The TUNEL method was performed using a DeadEnd™ apoptosis detection kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 72 h after transfection. Fixed cells were incubated with biotinylated deoxynucleotides, then stained with streptavidin-rhodamine conjugate (Molecular Probes) and Hoechst 33342. Cells were then observed by confocal laser scan microscopy. Western Blotting Analysis—Cells were lysed with a solution containing 0.1% SDS at 72 h after transfection. The cellular proteins (15 μg) were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-human Hsp105 (37Ishihara K. Yasuda K. Hatayama T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 138-142Google Scholar) or mouse anti-Hsp70 (Sigma) antibody, then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) for Hsp105 or anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) for Hsp70 at a 1:2,000 dilution. These proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein Purification—GST-tAR65-HA was expressed in BL21 bacterial cells on addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were collected and resuspended in ice-cold TEGM buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm sodium molybdate). Cells were then sonicated for 1 min and centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. To purify GST-tagged proteins, the supernatants were mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The Sepharose beads were then washed with PBS(–) and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Wild-type Hsp105α and its mutants were purified as His-tagged proteins by successive Ni2+-agarose (Invitrogen) and Mono Q anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatographies, as described previously (45Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Google Scholar). Detection of Aggregates of Truncated AR in Vitro—GST-tAR65-HA (1 μm) was incubated with Hsp105α, its mutants, or BSA in 20 μl of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at 30 °C for 12 h in the presence of 2 mm ADP. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of a solution containing 2% SDS and 100 mm dithiothreitol, and the mixtures were heated at 98 °C for 5 min. After the addition of 200 μl of a 1% SDS solution, the mixture was filtered through a 0.2-μm cellulose acetate membrane (Advantec). Aggregates on the membrane were incubated with anti-HA tag antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz) then with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2000) and detected with an ECL detection system (Santa Cruz). Immunohistochemistry—We perfused 20 ml of a 4% paraformaldehyde fixative in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, through the left cardiac ventricle of SBMA transgenic mice (49Katsuno M. Adachi H. Kume A. Li M. Nakagomi Y. Niwa H. Sang C. Kobayashi Y. Doyu M. Sobue G. Neuron. 2002; 35: 843-854Google Scholar) deeply anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine, postfixed tissues overnight in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin, and processed tissues for paraffin embedding. Then, 4-μm thick tissue sections were deparaffinized, dehydrated with alcohol, and treated in formic acid for 5 min at room temperature and with trypsin (Dako) for 20 min at 37 °C. The tissue sections were blocked with normal goat serum (1:20) and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse Hsp105 antibody (1:100). The sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories), and immune complexes were visualized using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Dako) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Dojindo) substrate and counterstained with methyl green. For the immunohistochemistry of tissues of SBMA patients, paraffin-embedded sections of the spinal cord and scrotal skin from nine patients with clinicopathologically and genetically confirmed SBMA (age 51–84 years, mean 64.3 years) were examined using rabbit anti-human Hsp105 antibody (1:100). Aggregation of Truncated AR with an Expanded Polyglutamine Tract and Induction Apoptosis in COS-7 and SK-N-SH Cells—Truncated ARs containing 24, 65, or 97 polyglutamine repeats (tAR24, tAR65, or tAR97, respectively) were transiently expressed in non-neuronal (COS-7) and neuronal cells (SK-N-SH) (Fig. 1). Because these tAR constructs were connected with GFP at the C terminus, the cellular localization of these chimerical peptides was detected by fluorescence microscopy. tAR65 or tAR97, but not tAR24, aggregated in cytoplasm and/or nucleus in non-neuronal COS-7 cells as well as neuronal SK-N-SH cells, as shown previously in the neuronal Neuro2a cell line (29Kobayashi Y. Kume A. Li M. Doyu M. Hata M. Ohtsuka K. Sobue G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8772-8778Google Scholar). Proportions of cells with aggregates increased depending on the incubation time after transfection and polyglutamine repeat length. Approximately 45 and 60% of GFP-positive cells had aggregates in the COS-7 and SK-N-SH cell lines, respectively, at 72 h after transfection of the expression plasmid for tAR97. Among the cells with aggregates of tAR97, intranuclear aggregates were detected in 40 and 8% of transfected COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells, respectively (data not shown). Under these conditions, apoptotic cells with condensed chromatin were observed in 12 and 18% of all COS-7 cells expressing GFP at 48 and 72 h after transfection of the expression plasmid for tAR97, respectively (Fig. 2A). In contrast, cells expressing tAR24 showed little apoptotic morphology after the transfection (Fig. 2A). Most apoptotic cells had aggregates of tAR97 in the nucleus, whereas cells containing cytoplasmic aggregates exhibited few apoptotic features (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, when the presence of fragmented DNA was assessed by the TUNEL method, the cells with intranuclear aggregates, but not cells with cytoplasmic aggregates, were found to be positive (Fig. 2C). These findings suggested that the intranuclear aggregates induced apoptosis in COS-7 cells. Similar results were obtained with SK-N-SH cells (data not shown). Thus, although both non-neuronal and neuronal cells could be utilized as a cell model of SBMA, we used the COS-7 model for further study because the cells expressed the transfected plasmids markedly well. Colocalization of Hsp105α and Hsp70 with Aggregates of Truncated AR—We next examined the cellular distribution of Hsp105α and Hsp70 in COS-7 cells by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-human Hsp105 and anti-Hsp70 antibodies. Under nonstressed conditions, endogenous Hsp105α and Hsc70/Hsp70 were localized mainly in the cytoplasm of cells (Fig. 3A). When tAR24 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, both endogenous Hsp105α and Hsp70 were also detected in the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 3, B and C). In contrast, when tAR97 was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, endogenous Hsp70 was colocalized to the aggregates of tAR97, whereas endogenous Hsp105α was not. However, when overexpressed with tAR97 in cells, Hsp105α was colocalized to the aggregates of tAR97 (Fig. 3D), whereas Hsp105α was localized to the cytoplasm of cells in which tAR97 was not expressed. Thus, the increased amounts of Hsp105α in cells seemed necessary for the interaction with and binding to the tAR containing an expanded polyglutamine tract. Overexpression of Hsp105α Reduced Aggregation of tAR97— Hsp105α prevents the aggregation of denatured protein in vitro (45Yamagishi N. Nishihori H. Ishihara K. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 272: 850-855Google Scholar) and suppresses apoptotic cell death induced by various forms of stress in neuronal PC12 cells (44Hatayama T. Yamagishi N. Minobe E. Sakai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 288: 528-534Google Scholar). Because the overexpressed Hsp105α colocalized to intracellular aggregates of tAR97 (Fig. 3), we next examined the effects of Hsp105α on the aggregation of tAR containing an expanded polyglutamine tract. When expression plasmids for Hsp105α and tAR97 were cotransfected into COS-7 cells, the proportion of cells with tAR97 aggregates was reduced to ∼50% of that transfected without Hsp105α (Fig. 4, A and B). Overexpression of Hsp70 or Hsp40 also suppressed the formation of aggregates similarly to Hsp105α, and Hsp70 and Hsp40 in combination suppressed the formation strongly. However, the suppression of aggregation by Hsp70 and Hsp40 was not enhanced by the coexpression of Hsp105α. When cellular toxicity was analyzed by examining the nuclear morphology of cells stained with Hoechst 33342, numbers of apoptotic cells with condensed chromatin were found to be markedly reduced by coexpression of Hsp105α with tAR97 (Fig. 4C). Overexpression of Hsp70 and/or Hsp40 also suppressed apoptotic cell death caused by expression of tAR97. Furthermore, when various amounts of Hsp105α were coexpressed with tAR97, the aggregation of tAR97 and apoptosis were both suppressed depending on cellular levels of Hsp105α (Fig. 5). Under these conditions, cellular levels of endogenous Hsp70 were not changed by overexpression of Hsp105α (Fig. 5, lower panel). These findings strongly suggested that when overexpressed, Hsp105α suppressed effectively not only"

We demonstrate for the first time that the EGF-induced apoptosis is accelerated if NF-κB is inactivated. To inactivate NF-κB, human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) that overexpress EGF receptor were stably transfected with an IκB-α double mutant construct. Under the NF-κB-inactivated condition, A431 cells were more sensitive to EGF with decreased cell viability and increased externalization of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface, DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspases (3 and 8 but not 9), typical features of apoptosis. These results were further supported by the potentiation of the growth inhibitory effects of EGF by chemical inhibitors of NF-κB (curcumin and sodium salicylate) and the protective role of RelA evidenced by the resistance of A431-RelA cells (stably transfected with RelA) to EGF-induced apoptosis. EGF treatment or ectopic expression of RelA in A431 cells induced DNA binding activity of NF-κB (p50 and RelA) and the expression of c-IAP1, a downstream target of NF-κB. A431-RelA cells exhibited spontaneous phosphorylation of Akt (a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and regulator of NF-κB) and EGF treatment stimulated it further. Blocking this basal Akt phosphorylation with LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, did not affect their viability but blocking of EGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt sensitized the otherwise resistant A431-RelA cells to EGF-mediated growth inhibition.

Upon ligand binding, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) dimerizes, autophosphorylates itself, and recruits a cascade of signaling molecules before transmitting potent mitogenic signals in many cellular systems (1Grant S.

Bull. 1991; 47: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Furthermore, increased EGFR expression correlates with a poorer clinical outcome for patients with breast and ovarian cancers (5Harris A.L. Breast Cancer Res.

Whereas EGF is a potent mitogen, it paradoxically induces apoptosis in cells that overexpress EGFR such as A431 (7Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Experimentally increasing the level of EGFR expression in epithelial, mesenchymal, or glial cells also leads to ligand-dependent apoptosis (8Hognason T. Chatterjee S. Vartanian T. Ratan R.R. Ernewein K.M. Habib A.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Another ligand of the EGF family, heregulin (also known as neuregulin), is known to induce apoptosis in cells that overexpress ErbB2, the second member of the EGFR family (9Daly J.M.

In addition, epiregulin also inhibited cell growth in EGFR-overexpressing cells (10Xi Q.S. Pan W. Zhang Q. Qian X.G. Li Z.P. Gan R.B. Sheng Wu Hua Xue Yu Sheng Wu Wu Li Xue Bao (Shanghai). 2000; 32: 601-604PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of amphiregulin mRNA was observed in EGF-induced apoptosis (11Silvy M. Martin P.M. Chajry N.

Growth factors other than EGF such as platelet-derived growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor can also trigger cell cycle arrest and death in a variety of cells (13Conner E.A. Teramoto T.

Anoikis, activation of EGFR tyrosine kinase, Ras-MAP kinase signaling, and the elevation of Stat1 and p21 levels have been advocated as mechanisms driving EGF-induced apoptosis (11Silvy M.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is a physiological process characterized by distinct morphological and biochemical features that include membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, cytoplasmic shrinking, DNA fragmentation, and activation of different caspases (19Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). Typically two different pathways, extrinsic receptor-mediated and intrinsic mitochondria-mediated, leading to apoptosis have been identified (20Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 21Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol.

Mostly cytokines of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily induce apoptosis by interaction of the ligand with its death receptor, which sequentially recruits TNF receptor-associated death domain, Fas-associated death domain, caspase 8, and caspase 3, the last then cleaves various substrates leading to apoptosis. In contrast, the mitochondria-mediated pathway involves the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria, and cytochrome c together with Apaf1 activates caspase 9, and the latter then activates caspase 3, resulting in apoptosis (20Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar, 21Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol.

Tumor cells often evade apoptosis by expressing several anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, down-regulation and mutation of pro-apoptotic genes and alterations of p53, PI-3K/Akt, or NF-κB pathways that give them survival advantage and thereby resist therapy-induced apoptosis (20Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1649) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a family of transcription factors activated by a diverse number of stimuli including EGF, cytokines, such as TNF-α and interleukin-1, UV irradiation, and lipopolysaccharides (22Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar). EGF has been reported to activate NF-κB in smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and in several EGFR-overexpressing cell lines (23Obata H. Biro S. Arima N. Kaieda H. Kihara T. Eto H. Miyata M. Tanaka H.

Binding of IκB to NF-κB masks nuclear localization signals and prevents its translocation to the nucleus (26Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Stimulation of cells with a diverse array of stimuli results in phosphorylation of IκB-α on serines 32 and 36 at its NH2-terminal. This leads to the ubiquitination and degradation of IκB-α, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription (22Karin M. Cao Y. Greten F.R. Li Z.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2258) Google Scholar, 26Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB activity potentiates cell killing of human breast cancer and fibrosarcoma cell lines by TNF-α, ionizing radiation, and daunorubicin (27Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

NF-κB directly causes increased expression of proteins that contribute to the survival of tumor cells such as inhibitors of apoptotic proteins (IAPs) (31Chu Z.L. McKinsey T.A. Liu L. Gentry J.J.

Results from our laboratory have shown earlier that ectopic expression of the RelA subunit of NF-κB into murine fibrosarcoma cells protects them from curcumin-induced apoptosis (33Anto R.J. Maliekal T.T. Karunagaran D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15601-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To understand whether NF-κB plays any role in EGF-induced apoptosis, we used A431 cells that overexpress EGFR and stably transfected them with a mutant IκB (known to inactivate NF-κB) or RelA (known to activate NF-κB). Using several parameters to assess apoptosis such as viability, externalization of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface, DNA fragmentation, and activation of caspases we report that A431 cells are more sensitive to EGF-induced apoptosis under NF-κB-inactivated conditions whereas its activation confers resistance. Reagents, Chemicals, and Antibodies—EGF (isolated from male mouse submaxillary glands), Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, and fetal bovine serum were procured from Invitrogen. Curcumin, sodium salicylate, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrate mixture, and a mouse monoclonal antibody to β-actin (A-5441) were purchased from Sigma. Fluorimetric substrates for caspase 3 (Ac-DEVD-AFC number 264157) and caspase 9 (Ac-LEHD-AFC number 218765) were obtained from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to p50 (sc-7178), RelA (sc-109), hemagglutinin (HA) (sc-7392), IκB-α (sc-271), and c-IAP1 (sc-7943) were procured from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Mouse monoclonal antibody to caspase 8 (1C12), rabbit polyclonal PARP antibody (number 9542), and phospho-Akt pathway sampler kit (number 9916 containing antibodies to Akt and phospho-Akt, and LY294002) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and the mouse monoclonal EGFR antibody (clone 111) raised against the extracellular domain of EGFR was a gift from Dr. Yosef Yarden, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel. Cell Lines and Culture—Human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 was obtained from the National Center for Cell Science, Pune, India. The cells were grown as monolayer cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Transient and Stable Transfections—A431-IκB-α cells were transiently transfected with relA in pMT2T vector (33Anto R.J.

Stable transfections in A431 cells with relA in pMT2T vector (co-transfected with pcDNA3) or the empty vector pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-IκB-α were carried out by the LipofectAMINE method (35Taylor N.A. Docherty K. Docherty K. Gene Transcription: RNA Analysis. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., London1996: 96-97Google Scholar). For the preparation of liposome solution, 20 μmol/ml of stock (prepared by mixing 6.6 μmol of dimethyl dioctadecyl ammonium bromide and 13.4 μmol of dioleyl-l-phosphatidylethanolamine in 1 ml of ethanol) was diluted into 1 nmol/μl in water. For transfection, the cells were seeded to attain 70% confluence in 35-mm Petri dishes. For each dish, 2 μg of DNA and 24 μl of liposome solution were mixed in 500 μl of Dulbecco's minimum essential medium free from serum and antibiotics, vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. The liposome solution (1 ml) was layered over the cells previously rinsed with serum-free medium and left for 4 h in a CO2 incubator and then the medium was replenished with 20% fetal bovine serum and reverted back to 10% fetal bovine serum after 24 h. After 72 h, cells were grown in selection medium (400 μg/ml G418) and clones formed were picked up and maintained separately with 100 μg/ml G418. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in whole cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X 100, 1 mm DTT, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 mm sodium orthovanadate). Equal amounts of total protein for each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters, probed with the primary antibodies and appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method as per the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). For some experiments, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies from Sigma were used and the bands were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Cells were washed with cold PBS and suspended in 150 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The cells were allowed to swell for 30 min, after which 4.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added, vortexed, and centrifuged, and the pellet was suspended in 25 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml benzamidine). The nuclear extract (8 μg of protein) collected after 30 min by centrifugation was used to perform EMSA by incubating it with 16 fmol of 32P-end labeled 45-mer double stranded NF-κB oligonucleotide from the human immunodeficiency virus-1 long terminal repeat (5′-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGCGTGG-3′) in the presence of 1 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) in a binding buffer (25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol) for 30 min at 37 °C and the DNA-protein complex was resolved using a 6.6% native polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and the radioactive bands were visualized by phosphorimaging (Bio-Rad Personal FX). MTT Assay—For MTT assay, 25 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added to cells (untreated and treated) cultured in 96-well plates. Cells were incubated for 2 h and 0.1 ml of the extraction buffer (20% sodium dodecyl sulfate in 50% dimethyl formamide) was added after removal of MTT with a PBS wash. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, the optical densities at 570 nm were measured using a plate reader (Bio-Rad), with the extraction buffer as a blank. The relative cell viability in percentage was calculated as (A 570 of treated samples/A 570 of untreated samples) × 100. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—Cells grown in 96-well plates were treated with or without the indicated concentrations of EGF and at the end of 18 h, [3H]thymidine was added to each well (0.5 μCi/well) and the incubation was continued for a total period of 24 h. The culture medium was then removed, washed twice with PBS, and the proteins were precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant was removed and after washing with ethanol, the cells were solubilized with 0.2 n NaOH, and the radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation counter. Annexin-PI Staining—The cells (104 cells/well) were seeded in 48-well plates and treated with or without EGF for 16 h. Then the cells were washed with PBS and treated with 1× assay buffer, annexin-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide (PI) as per the protocol described in the annexin V apoptosis detection kit (sc-4252 AK) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. After 10 –20 min, the wells were washed with PBS and greenish apoptotic cells were viewed using a Nikon fluorescent microscope and photographed. Comet Assay—Comet assay was carried out essentially as described (36Singh N.P. McCoy M.T. Tice R.R. Schneider E.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 175: 184-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (9058) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells (treated with or without EGF) were pelleted and resuspended in 0.5% low melting point agarose at 37 °C and layered on a frosted microscope slide previously coated with a thin layer of 0.5% normal melting agarose and kept for 5 min at 4 °C. After solidification, the slides were immersed in lysing solution (2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 10.5, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% Me2SO) for 1 h at 4 °C. The slides were then electrophoresed for 20 to 30 min at 25 V. The slides after electrophoresis were washed with 0.4 m Tris (pH 7.5) and stained with ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) and observed under a Nikon fluorescent microscope. Assays of Caspase 3 and Caspase 9 —The enzymatic activities of caspase 3 or caspase 9 were assayed spectrofluorimetrically (37Ito A. Uehara T. Tokumitsu A. Okuma Y. Nomura Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1452: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the whole cell lysate was incubated with 50 μm fluorimetric substrates of caspase 3 (Ac-DEVD-AFC) or caspase 9 (Ac-LEHD-AFC) in a total volume of 500 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1% CHAPS, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT) at 37 °C for 1 h. The released AFC was quantitated using a spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer LS-50 B) with the excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 460 nm, respectively. Values of relative fluorescence units released per mg of protein were calculated. EGF Induces NF-κB DNA Binding Activity in A431-Neo but Not A431-IκB-α Cells—The human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, A431, overexpresses EGFRs (about 2 × 106 EGFRs/cell) and has been extensively used as a model system to study the effects of EGF on cell proliferation (7Barnes D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 38Gulli L.F. Palmer K.C. Chen Y.Q. Reddy K.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 173-178PubMed Google Scholar, 39Filmus J.

Nature. 1981; 293: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To study the role of NF-κB in EGF-induced apoptosis, we used A431 cells and stably transfected them with either the empty vector (pcDNA3) or pcDNA3-IκB-α, a double mutant construct in which both the serines (32 and 36) at the amino-terminal of IκB-α are mutated to alanine. Because the double mutant form of IκB-α lacks the crucial serine residues that need to be phosphorylated by NF-κB activators, it is popularly employed to strongly inhibit NF-κB (28Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2449) Google Scholar). As the construct, pcDNA3-IκB-α, contains the hemagglutinin tag (HA tag), Western blotting of HA protein was used to ascertain the presence of the mutant IκB protein. As expected, all six clones of A431-IκB-α cells (selected by G418) showed the presence of HA protein whereas the A431-Neo cells transfected with control vector (pcDNA3) did not show its expression (Fig. 1A). Further experiments with IκB-transfected cells were done using only clone 6 of A431-IκB-α cells (showing very high HA expression) unless stated otherwise. Western blotting with a polyclonal IκB-α antibody confirmed that clone 6 had indeed a higher level of IκB-α expression compared with that in the parental as well as A431-Neo cells (Fig. 1B). For the Western blots, β-actin was used as a control and the results confirm equal loading of the samples (Fig. 1, A and B). To see whether transfection procedures affected the level of EGFR, Western blotting was carried out in parental, A431-Neo, and A431-IκB-α cells and the results confirmed that EGFR levels remained unaffected in these cells (Fig. 1C). Because the very purpose of stable transfection was to inactivate NF-κB, it was logical to check whether EGF could stimulate the NF-κB DNA binding activity in A431-Neo and A431-IκB-α cells (clone 6) by EMSA. Whereas 50 ng/ml EGF enhanced the NF-κB DNA binding activity in A431-Neo cells, even 100 ng/ml EGF could not induce it in A431-IκB-α cells and in the absence of EGF there were no active DNA-binding complexes of NF-κB in both the cells (Fig. 1D). To confirm whether the active complex contains the classical NF-κB partners, p50 and RelA, the nuclear extracts prepared from A431-Neo cells stimulated with 50 ng/ml EGF were incubated with antibodies to RelA or p50 and then EMSA was carried out. As shown in Fig. 1E, both antibodies shifted the active NF-κB complex (supershift) whereas incubation with excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB binding site removed the active complex. Fig. 1E also shows that transient transfection of A431-IκB-α cells with relA restored the NF-κB active complex, and relA transfection was used by us earlier to constitutively activate NF-κB in L-929 cells (33Anto R.J. Maliekal T.T. Karunagaran D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15601-15604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These results confirm that the A431-IκB-α cells express the mutant form of IκB-α that inactivated NF-κB and hence, EGF could not stimulate NF-κB DNA binding activity in these cells. The results also indicate that EGF can induce the NF-κB DNA binding activity in A431-Neo cells and the active NF-κB complex contains the heterodimers, p50 and RelA. In addition, the results show that RelA, being one of the heterodimeric partners of active NF-κB, favors the formation of active NF-κB DNA binding complexes and has the potential to reverse the NF-κB-inactivating effect of IκB. A431-IκB-α Cells Are More Sensitive to EGF-induced Cytotoxicity and DNA Fragmentation Than A431-Neo Cells—To study the effects of EGF on cell growth under conditions of NF-κB inactivation, A431-Neo and A431-IκB-α cells were exposed to various concentrations of EGF and the cell viability in percentage over untreated control was determined after 72 h by MTT assay. The MTT assay is a convenient screening assay for the measurement of cell death while it does not discriminate between apoptosis and necrosis. EGF treatment at 0.01 and 0.1 ng/ml had a stimulatory effect on A431-Neo cells with cell viabilities of 130 and 110%, respectively, if the viability of untreated control was taken as 100% at the end of 72 h (Fig. 2A). In contrast, EGF inhibited the A431-IκB-α cells with only 81 and 67% of cells being alive for the concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 ng/ml, respectively, compared with the control (Fig. 2A). As can be seen in Fig. 2A, EGF at a concentration of 1 ng/ml and above was inhibitory to both A431-Neo and A431-IκB-α cells. Thus, even at concentrations that were stimulatory to A431-Neo cells, EGF inhibited the growth of A431-IκB-α cells (Fig. 2A) suggesting that A431-IκB-α cells are much more sensitive to EGF-induced cytotoxicity and these results were also confirmed in 2 other clones of A431-IκB-α (data not shown). We also examined the effect of EGF on DNA synthesis by the method of thymidine incorporation after exposing the cells to different concentrations of EGF (1–10 ng/ml) found to be inhibitory to both A431-Neo and A431-IκB-α cells by the MTT assay. EGF inhibited DNA synthesis in both A431-Neo and A431-IκB-α cells in a dose-dependent manner and again the A431-IκB-α cells were more sensitive to EGF-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 2B). DNA fragmentation is another hallmark of apoptosis and to detect this, we have used the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet assay), a sensitive technique that allows detection of DNA strand breaks. DNA strand breaks create fragments that when embedded in agarose gels migrate in an electric field. Cells with damaged DNA when stained with ethidium bromide appear like a comet and the length of the comet tail represents the extent of DNA damage. Fig. 2C clearly indicates that well formed comets are more in number in A431-IκB-α than A431-Neo cells when induced with 5 ng/ml EGF while the untreated cells did not exhibit the comet morphology in both the cells. These results suggest that A431-IκB-α cells with inactivated NF-κB are more susceptible to cell death induced by EGF compared with A431-Neo cells. Relatively More A431-IκB-α Cells Undergo EGF-induced Exter"
https://openalex.org/W2166608001,"Cancer cells in which the PTEN lipid phosphatase gene is deleted have constitutively activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling and require activation of this pathway for survival. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, PI3K-dependent signaling is typically activated through mechanisms other than PTEN gene loss. The role of PI3K in the survival of cancer cells that express wild-type PTEN has not been defined. Here we provide evidence that H1299 NSCLC cells, which express wild-type PTEN, underwent proliferative arrest following treatment with an inhibitor of all isoforms of class I PI3K catalytic activity (LY294002) or overexpression of the PTEN lipid phosphatase. In contrast, overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of the p85α regulatory subunit of PI3K (Δp85) induced apoptosis. Whereas PTEN and Δ85 both inhibited activation of AKT/protein kinase B, only Δp85 inhibited c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. Cotransfection of the constitutively active mutant Rac-1 (Val12), an upstream activator of JNK, abrogated Δp85-induced lung cancer cell death, whereas constitutively active mutant mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK)-1 (R4F) did not. Furthermore, LY294002 induced apoptosis of MKK4-null but not wild-type mouse embryo fibroblasts. Therefore, we propose that, in the setting of wild-type PTEN, PI3K- and MKK4/JNK-dependent pathways cooperate to maintain cell survival.

Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Google Scholar, 2Vanhaesbrock B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Google Scholar, 3Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Google Scholar). The known gene family members for p85 (α, β, and γ) and p110 (α, β, δ, and γ) are expressed in a tissue-specific fashion. p85α and -β can also exist in smaller forms (p50 and p55). PI3K phosphorylates the D3 position of PI on PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P to produce PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3. The 3′ sites of PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 are dephosphorylated by the PTEN tumor suppressor, whereas the 5′ site of PI(3,4,5)P3 is dephosphorylated by SHIP to produce PI(3,4)P2 (1Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Google Scholar). These mechanisms tightly regulate the levels of 3-phosphorylated PI in the cell. PI(3,4,5)P3 and PI(3,4)P2 recruit the pleckstrin homology domains of specific intracellular proteins to the plasma membrane, an essential event in the activation of PI3K-dependent kinases such as phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and AKT, also known as protein kinase B. In addition, AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 and Ser473 by integrin-linked kinase (and possibly other kinases) constitutes an essential event in AKT activation (4Alessi D.R.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3207-3212Google Scholar). The PI3K pathway clearly has a key role in cellular survival and transformation. AKT phosphorylates several pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, including the Bcl-2 family member BAD, caspase-9, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, the inhibitor of NF-κB kinase IKKα, and forkhead transcription factor-1 (6Di Cristofano A. Pandolfi P.P. Cell. 2000; 100: 387-390Google Scholar). Tumor cells feature genetic and epigenetic alterations of p85α, p110α/β, AKT2, AKT3, and PTEN that activate PI3K-dependent signaling (7Bellacosa A. de Feo D. Godwin A.K. Bell D.W. Cheng J.Q.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7034-7045Google Scholar). PI3K mediates its oncogenic effects, in part, through the GTP-binding protein Rac-1, which plays a key role in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton induced by growth factors or oncogenic Ras (20Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons F. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Google Scholar). p85α interacts directly with Rac-1 (21Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Google Scholar). Ras activates Rac-1 indirectly as a consequence of PI3K-mediated phosphorylation of membrane PIs (22Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Google Scholar). PI(3,4,5)P3 binds to the guanosine nucleotide-exchange factor SOS, stimulating SOS to load Rac-1 with GTP, an essential event in Rac-1 activation. Rac-1, in turn, activates downstream signaling through PAK-1 and its mediators, which include mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4 (MKK4) and its substrates c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38/HOG1 (23Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Google Scholar). Certain cancer cell types with PTEN gene loss have constitutively active PI3K and undergo apoptosis in response to pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PI3K (24Neshat M.S. Mellinghoff I.K. Tran C.

Most non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines demonstrate hallmarks of PI3K pathway activation, such as phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream mediators, but have a wild-type PTEN gene (25Brognard J.

Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997Google Scholar). The apoptosis reported by Brognard et al. (25Brognard J. Clark A.S. Ni Y. Dennis P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3986-3997Google Scholar) may depend in part on the absence of serum, which rescues cells from apoptosis induced by PI3K inhibition (18Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406Google Scholar, 19Lu Y. Lin Y.Z. LaPushin R. Cuevas B. Fang X. Yu S.X. Davies M.A. Khan H. Furui T. Mao M. Zinner R. Hung M.C. Steck P. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5002-5008Google Scholar). Thus, serum-induced activation of other peptide growth factor-induced signaling pathways can overcome the pro-apoptotic effect of PI3K inhibition. In this study, we investigated the signaling pathways that interact with PI3K to control NSCLC cell survival. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches, we found that inhibition of PI3K-dependent signaling alone induced proliferative arrest, whereas inhibition of both PI3K and MKK4/JNK-dependent pathways induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that, in the setting of wild-type PTEN, PI3K- and MKK4/JNK-dependent pathways cooperate to maintain cell survival. Reagents—H358, H661, Calu-6, H460, H226B, H226Br, H441, and H1299 NSCLC cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (complete medium). COS-7 cells and MKK4-null and wild-type mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cells (33Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvani L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstrin A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. We purchased epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Invitrogen), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), the class I PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA), tumor necrosis factor-α (Sigma), recombinant GST-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), myelin basic protein (MBP) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), GST-GSK3β (Santa Cruz), and protein A-G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz). We also purchased rabbit polyclonal antibodies against human phospho-AKT (pAKT1; Ser473) and AKT1 (New England Biolabs), phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185; Cell Signaling Technologies), p85α, cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 2, and p27 (Santa Cruz), and murine monoclonal antibodies against human PTEN (Santa Cruz), phosphoextracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Thr202/Tyr204; Cell Signaling), caspase-3 and -9 (BD Pharmingen), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (VIC5) (Roche Diagnostics), and goat polyclonal antibodies against human ERK1/2, JNK-1, and β-actin (Santa Cruz). The adenoviral vector expressing wild-type p85α (Adex1CAp85α-HA) has been described elsewhere (34Ueki K. Algenstaedt P. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8035-8046Google Scholar). A recombinant adenovirus expressing human PTEN under the control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter was a gift from Dr. W. K. A. Yung (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). Plasmid expression vectors containing Rac-1 (Val12) and MKK1 (R4F) were gifts from Dr. Melanie Cobb (The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Generation of Ad5-Δp85—Δp85 is a bovine p85α mutant lacking 35 amino acids (residues Met479 to Lys513) in the inter-SH2 region that are necessary for binding to the p110 catalytic subunit (35Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Google Scholar). The Δp85 cDNA was inserted into the 5′ end of the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal at the HindIII site of the pAd-shuttle vector, which was a gift from Dr. Jack Roth (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center). The Δp85-containing shuttle vector was digested with BstI/ClaI and inserted into the pAd-speed vector (36Ji L. Nishizaki M. Gao B. Burbee D. Toyooka S. Kamibayashi C. Xu K. Yen N. Atkinson E.N. Fang B. Lerman M.I. Roth J.A. Minna J.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2715-2720Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected with the resulting plasmid and then maintained until the onset of the cytopathic effect. Viral titers were determined by plaque assays and spectrophotometric analysis. The presence of Δp85 in viral particles was confirmed by dideoxy-DNA sequencing and Western blot analysis. Cell Growth Assays—NSCLC cell lines were seeded at 1–2 × 103 cells/well in 96-well plates. After 24 h, cells were incubated in serum-free conditions with 5 × 102, 1 × 103, 5 × 103, or 1 × 104 p/cell of Ad5-Δp85, Ad5-PTEN, or Ad5-CMV (control virus). After 2 h, cells were changed to complete medium. In the case of LY294002 treatment, cells were treated with 0.2, 2, 20, 40, 60, or 80 μm LY294002 in complete medium, which was changed every 48 h. After 5 days, cell growth was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared by incubating cell pellets in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm benzamidine) for 20 min on ice. After clarification by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration was determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Cell lysates (30 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were immunoblotted overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk. Antibody binding was detected with an electrochemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's directions. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Assays—For these experiments, 1 × 106 H1299 cells were transferred onto 100-mm plates. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were incubated with 1 × 103,5 × 103,or1 × 104 particles of Ad5-Δp85 or Ad5-PTEN per cell. For combination treatments, H1299 cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmids containing Rac-1 (Val12), MKK1 (R4F), or empty vector using FuGENE (Roche Diagnostics). After 6 h, the cells were incubated for 2 h in serum-free conditions with Ad5-Δp85 or Ad5-CMV at 1 × 103 or 5 × 103 particles/cell. Cells were allowed to grow in complete medium for 48 h before being subjected to apoptosis assays. Apoptosis and cell cycle progression were measured by TUNEL with the APO-BRDU staining kit (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA). Floating cells and attached cells were dispersed with trypsin-EDTA, pelleted, washed, and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice and then fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were washed and incubated with DNA labeling solution containing terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase reaction buffer, deoxynucleotidyltransferase enzyme, and bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate (BrdUrd-dUTP). The cells were rinsed before being resuspended with fluorescein-PRB-1 antibody solution and analyzed by flow cytometry in the presence of propidium iodide/RNase solution. Analyses of 3,000 to 10,000 events were done with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Pharmingen) equipped with a 488-nm argon ion laser and two software packages: CellQuest 3.1 (BD Pharmingen) and ModFit LT 2.0 (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Live gating of the forward and orthogonal scatter channels was used to exclude debris and to selectively acquire cell events. A dual display of DNA area (linear red fluorescence) and BrdUrd-dUTP incorporation (FITC-PRB-1) was used to determine the percentage of propidium iodine-stained cells that were apoptotic. Apoptosis was also determined by the detection of nucleosomal DNA fragmentation by using the TACS apoptotic DNA laddering kit (Trevigen, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, DNA was isolated from cells after adenovirus transfection or LY294002 treatment by incubating them in lysis buffer. DNA samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—H1299 cells were incubated for 2 h with Ad5-CMV, Ad5-Δp85, or Ad5-PTEN at 1 × 103, 5 × 103, or 1 × 104 p/cell in serum-free conditions, changed to complete medium, and incubated for 48 h. Cells were then washed twice in 1× phosphate-buffered saline, serum-starved for 24 h, treated with 50 ng/ml EGF for 15 min, and lysed in lysis buffer. Extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation (100 μg) with antibodies to JNK1, AKT1/2, or ERK1/2 by rotation at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-G-agarose beads (20 μl) were added, and the solution was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 mm sodium orthovanadate). Kinase assays were performed by incubating the beads with 30 μl of kinase buffer, to which 20 μm cold ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (2,000 cpm/pmol), and 2 μg of GST-c-Jun, GST-GSK3β, or MBP as substrates were added. The kinase reaction was performed at 30 °C for 20 min. The samples were then suspended in 1× Laemmli buffer and boiled for 5 min, and the samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Immune complex assays were also performed with COS-7 cells, which were transiently transfected for 6 h with 5 μg of plasmids containing Rac-1 (Val12), MKK1 (R4F), or empty vector using FuGENE. The cells were then transfected with Ad5-Δp85 or Ad5-CMV (1 × 103 or 5 × 103 particles/cell) and incubated in complete medium for 24 h. The cells were then changed to serum-free medium for 24 h, treated with IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) for 15 min, and lysed. JNK and ERK were immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of total cell lysates and subjected to kinase assays using GST-c-Jun and MBP, respectively, as substrates. Rac-1 Activity Assays—Pull-down assays with GST-tagged p21 binding domain (PBD) of PAK-1 were performed as follows. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of HA-tagged p85α, HA-tagged p110α, and Δp85 (2, 4, or 6 μg) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Total amount of DNA transfected per plate was equalized with empty vector. After 6 h, transfectants were washed and changed to normal growth medium. After 24 h, transfectants were serum-starved for 16 h, treated with 50 ng/ml EGF or IGF-1 for 15 min, and lysed. PAK-1 PBD-agarose (5 μg in a 50% slurry) was added to the lysates and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The bead pellet was collected by centrifugation (5 s at 14,000 × g) and the supernatant was drained off. The beads were then washed and suspended in 20 μl of 1× Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted against Rac-1 and CDC42 polyclonal antibodies. PI3K-dependent Pathway Contributes to NSCLC Cell Proliferation and Survival—We investigated the effects of PI3K inhibition on the proliferation and viability of H1299 NSCLC cells, which have a wild-type PTEN gene (27Forgacs E. Biesterveld E.J. Sekido Y. Fong K. Muneer S. Wistuba I.I. Milchgrub S. Brezinschek R. Virmani A. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1557-1565Google Scholar). H1299 cells were transfected with recombinant adenoviruses that express PTEN (Ad5-PTEN) or Δp85 (Ad5-Δp85), a p85α dominant-negative mutant lacking the inter-SH2 residues required for binding to the p110 catalytic domain (35Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Waterfield M.D. Kasuga M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Google Scholar). Transfection of H1299 cells with Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-Δp85 increased the expression of the adenoviral gene products and suppressed pAKT levels (Fig. 1), providing evidence that these adenoviral vectors effectively blocked PI3K-dependent signaling. When H1299 cells were incubated with Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-Δp85, cell number decreased in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2, A and B). H1299 cell number also decreased in a dose-dependent manner after treatment with LY294002, a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to all isoforms of class I PI3K (Fig. 2C). Other NSCLC cell lines with wild-type PTEN (H358, Calu-6, H460, H661, H226B, H441, H1299, and H226Br) underwent a similar decrease in cell number following treatment with LY294002 or transfection with Ad5-Δp85 or Ad5-PTEN (data not shown).Fig. 2Effect of PI3K inhibition on H1299 cell numbers. H1299 cells were (A) incubated with the indicated titers of Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-CMV, (B) incubated with the indicated titers of Ad5-Δp85 or Ad5-CMV, or (C) treated with medium alone (0) or the indicated doses of LY294002. The cells were incubated for 5 days, at which time they were subjected to 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays. Results are expressed relative to the density of cells treated with medium alone. Each value is the mean (± S.D.) of five identical wells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next investigated whether PI3K inhibition induced proliferative arrest or apoptosis of NSCLC cells by performing flow cytometric analysis of H1299 cells transfected with Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-Δp85 and then stained with propidium iodide (Fig. 3A). Ad5-PTEN transfection induced proliferative arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, with minimal evidence of programmed cell death, as shown by the lack of a hypodiploid peak. Although Ad5-Δp85 transfection also caused an accumulation of cells in G1, its most striking effect was apoptosis, as indicated by the appearance of a hypodiploid peak. We examined this finding further by using terminal deoxynucleotidetransferase nick-end labeling (TUNEL), a more sensitive assay for apoptosis, and found low levels of DNA fragmentation in cells transfected with Ad5-PTEN (Fig. 3B). In contrast, transfection with Ad5-Δp85 produced much more DNA fragmentation, which is compatible with the induction of high levels of apoptosis (Fig. 3B). We investigated the effect of Ad5-PTEN and Ad5-Δp85 on signaling events known to contribute to apoptosis, proliferative arrest, or both (Fig. 4). Ad5-Δp85 transfection reduced the levels of procaspase-9, procaspase-3, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, demonstrating evidence of caspase activation and proteolysis of a caspase-3 substrate. In contrast, Ad5-PTEN transfection decreased CDK2 levels and increased p27 CDK inhibitor levels without evidence of caspase activation or poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Together, these findings support a role for PI3K in the proliferation of NSCLC cells and demonstrate a pro-apoptotic effect of Δp85. Δp85 Inhibits the Activity of MAP Kinases—Δp85 induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells whereas PTEN did not. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway was required but not sufficient to induce apoptosis. We sought to identify additional survival signals typically activated by peptide growth factors that are inhibited by Δp85. Receptor tyrosine kinases maintain NSCLC cell survival, in part, by activating MAP kinases (37Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Google Scholar). We investigated the role of MAP kinases in Δp85-induced cell death. H1299 NSCLC cells were incubated with Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-Δp85, treated with EGF, and subjected to in vitro kinase assays of JNK and ERK activity (Fig. 5). ERK activity increased in cells incubated with Ad5-CMV. Ad5-PTEN and Ad5-Δp85 had similar, dose-dependent effects on ERK activity. Relative to the effect of Ad5CMV, ERK activity increased with low dose (103 particles/cell) and decreased with high dose (5 × 103 or 104 particles/cell) Ad5-PTEN or Ad5-Δp85. JNK activity decreased minimally after Ad5-PTEN and, to a much greater extent, after Ad5-Δp85 incubation. Thus, Δp85 was unique in its ability to inhibit JNK activity. We investigated the mechanism by which Δp85 inhibited JNK. p85α associates with Rac-1, an upstream activator of JNK, and activates Rac-1 through association with a multiprotein complex that binds to p85 SH2 domains (38Innocenti M. Fritolli E. Ponzanelli I. Falck J.R. Brachman S.M. Di Fiore P.P. Scita G. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 17-23Google Scholar). We investigated whether wild-type p85α and Δp85 differ in their ability to activate Rac-1. We quantitated Rac-1 activity in cell extracts using a pull-down assay with a GST-tagged PBD of PAK-1, which associates selectively with GTP-bound (activated) Rac-1 or CDC42. PBD-associated proteins are subjected to Western analysis to quantitate Rac-1 and CDC42. We performed this experiment in COS-7 cells, in which peptide growth factors activate Rac-1 through a PI3K-dependent mechanism (21Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17656-17659Google Scholar, 22Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Google Scholar). Using this assay we showed that Rac-1 is activated by treatment with EGF or IGF-1 (Fig. 6A). COS cells were co-transfected with wild-type p85 and increasing amounts of Δp85 and treated with EGF to activate Rac-1. Relative to the effect of wild-type p85, Δp85 inhibited peptide growth factor-induced activation of Rac-1 but not CDC42 (Fig. 6B). Thus, in contrast to the stimulatory effect of p85α, Δp85 inhibited Rac-1. p85α serves both to stabilize p85 protein and to inactivate PI3K lipid kinase activity (39Cuevas B.D. Lu Y. Mao M. Zhang J. LaPushin R. Siminovitch K. Mills G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27455-27461Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that Ad5-Δp85 inhibits intracellular signaling activity by increasing intracellular p85 protein levels. We incubated H1299 NSCLC cells with various doses of Ad5-Δp85 or an adenoviral vector expressing full-length p85α (Adex1CAp85α-HA) and examined their rel"
https://openalex.org/W1991019609,"Protein ectodomain shedding is a specialized type of regulated proteolysis that releases the extracellular domain of transmembrane proteins. The metalloprotease disintegrin tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) has been convincingly shown to play a central role in ectodomain shedding, but despite its broad interest, very little is known about the mechanisms that regulate its activity. An analysis of the biosynthesis of TACE in mutant cell lines that have a gross defect in ectodomain shedding (M1 and M2) shows a defective removal of the prodomain that keeps TACE in an inactive form. Using LoVo, a cell line that lacks of active furin, and α1-Antitrypsin Portland, a protein inhibitor of proprotein convertases, we show that TACE is normally processed by furin and other proprotein convertases. The defect in M1 and M2 cells is due to a blockade of the exit of TACE from the endoplasmic reticulum. The processing of other zinc-dependent metalloproteases, previously suggested to participate in activated ectodomain shedding is normal in the mutant cells, indicating that the component mutated is highly specific for TACE. In summary, the characterization of shedding-defective somatic cell mutants unveils the existence of a specific mechanism that directs the proteolytic activation of TACE through the control of its exit from the ER."

To identify the functional pair, the conserved bidentate -Z glutamate in these EF-hands was mutated to yield E53Q-, E94A-, and E124A-sorcin, respectively. Limited structural perturbations occur only in E124A-sorcin due to involvement of Glu-124 in a network of interactions that comprise the long D helix connecting EF3 to EF2.

Based on this experimental evidence, EF3 and EF2, which are not paired in the canonical manner, are the functional EF-hands.

Hitomi K. Maki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 68-75Google Scholar). All these proteins bind to cell membranes through a Ca2+-dependent interaction with protein targets that permits transduction of various Ca2+-mediated signals. Sorcin is thought to participate in different Ca2+-triggered biochemical cascades since different target proteins have been identified in the cell types where the protein is expressed constitutively, namely the ryanodine receptor (Ryr) and the α1 subunit of L-type calcium channels in muscle cells (6Meyers M.B.

The EF-hand, a structural motif characterized by a helix-loop-helix structure, is used by a large number of proteins to bind Ca2+ with high affinity. In the “canonical” motif, Ca2+ is coordinated by a 12-amino-acid-long interhelical loop sequence with pentagonal bipyramidal symmetry. In this arrangement, four conserved side chains provide the five equatorial ligands (Y, Z, -Y, -Z) since the glutamate residue in position -Z establishes a bidentate interaction with the metal. The two apical ligands are furnished by the side chain of an acidic group (X) and by a water molecule (-X). Changes in the loop sequence occur such that the EF-hands may not bind Ca2+ or may not be recognized in the protein primary structure. In the PEF family, the extensively modified EF4 and EF5 loops do not bind Ca2+, and the N-terminal motif designated EF1 was not recognized by sequence analysis since the loop is one amino acid shorter than the canonical one. The existence of the EF1 hand was revealed only by the x-ray crystal structure of the calpain subunits, the family prototype (1Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur S.C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Google Scholar, 2Lin G. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yu P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 539-546Google Scholar). In a typical manner, EF-hands occur in pairs that are coupled structurally and functionally. The structural association takes place through a short two-stranded β sheet arrangement that gives rise to stable domains. Moreover, binding of Ca2+ elicits a change from a “closed” to an “open” conformation that leads to exposure of hydrophobic surfaces for target interaction. In the PEF family, all the EF-hands are clustered in the C-terminal domain that is characterized by a very similar, compact fold in all the proteins, as exemplified by the sorcin structure depicted in Fig. 1. The EF1-EF2 and EF3-EF4 pairs are associated in the canonical manner, although EF5 is unpaired in the monomer but interacts with the same motif of a second monomer in the native form of the molecule, a dimeric assemblage (2Lin G. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yu P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 539-546Google Scholar, 12Ilari A. Johnson K.A.

An intriguing peculiarity of the Ca2+ binding domain is the unusual presence of two long (six turns) α-helices that are shared by EF2 and EF3 (D helix) and by EF4 and EF5 (G helix). At least in principle, this direct structural link between the two canonical EF-hand pairs may represent the natural means for transferring functional information between them. The compact structure of the C-terminal Ca2+ binding domain contrasts the flexibility of the N-terminal domain, which is of variable length in the different PEF proteins but is always rich in glycine and proline residues. Because of its nature, the N-terminal domain is not visible in the available x-ray crystal structures of the whole proteins, namely those of sorcin (15Xie X. Dwyer M.D. Swenson L. Parker M.H. Botfield M.C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2419-2425Google Scholar), grancalcin (13Jia J. Han Q. Borregaard N. Lollike K. Cygler M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1271-1281Google Scholar, 16Jia J. Borregaard N. Lollike K. Cygler M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2001; 57: 1843-1849Google Scholar), and calpain (17Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H.

The present understanding of the relationships between structure and function in the PEF family is far from complete. The x-ray structures show that three EF sites are potentially able to bind Ca2+ in the physiological range of concentrations, namely the unusual EF1 motif and EF2 and EF3, whose structural features resemble those of EF-hands in regulatory Ca2+-binding proteins. However, binding of only two Ca2+/monomer suffices to trigger the conformational change that exposes hydrophobic regions and leads to interaction with the respective targets (3Lollike K. Johnsen A.H. Durussel I. Borregaard N. Cox A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17762-17769Google Scholar, 19Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Google Scholar, 20Kitaura Y. Matsumoto S. Satoh H. Hitomi K. Maki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14053-14058Google Scholar). The available data indicate that functional coupling does not involve the same EF-hands in the different proteins, suggesting that despite the high structural similarity there is no common mode of information transfer within the PEF family. Furthermore, the mechanism of communication between Ca2+-binding sites has not been elucidated. In sorcin, the characterization of a protein fragment (90–198) lacking the first two EF-hands pointed to EF1 and EF2 as the physiological pair (19Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Google Scholar). In grancalcin, EF1 and EF3 that are not linked structurally are coupled functionally; EF2 is unable to bind Ca2+ due to the presence of alanine in place of the canonical, bidentate -Z glutamate (3Lollike K. Johnsen A.H. Durussel I. Borregaard N. Cox A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17762-17769Google Scholar). In ALG-2, studies with site-specific mutants indicate that, as in grancalcin, the EF1 and EF3 motifs form the functionally relevant Ca2+ binding pair (4Lo K.W.-H. Zhang Q. Li M. Zhang M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7498-7508Google Scholar), whereas in calpain all the first three EF hands contribute to Ca2+ binding, with EF3 having the highest affinity (2Lin G. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yu P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 539-546Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism that triggers the Ca2+-signaling process and leads to a change in the subcellular localization of PEF proteins through the specific interaction with protein targets is still obscure. The Ca2+-induced conformational changes manifest in the x-ray crystal structures are unexpectedly small and are limited to the EF1 region (1Blanchard H. Grochulski P. Li Y. Arthur S.C. Davies P.L. Elce J.S. Cygler M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 532-538Google Scholar, 2Lin G. Chattopadhyay D. Maki M. Wang K.K.W. Carson M. Jin L. Yu P.W. Takano E. Hatanaka M. DeLucas L.J. Narayana S.V. Nat.

A. 2000; 97: 588-592Google Scholar), and it is not known how these small changes are amplified to the extent required for target protein interaction. In the present work sorcin was used to address these aspects of the structure-function relationships in PEF proteins. Sorcin and its isolated Ca2+ binding domain have been characterized extensively in solution (19Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Google Scholar, 21Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Google Scholar, 22Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Vecchini P. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 1-6Google Scholar, 23Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Mattei B. Noegel A.A. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 197-200Google Scholar). Moreover, a model for the Ca2+-dependent processes in the full-length protein has been proposed on the basis of the x-ray crystal structure of the Ca2+ binding domain (12Ilari A. Johnson K.A. Nastopoulos V. Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Colotti G. Tsernoglou D. Chiancone E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 447-458Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding is thought to weaken the interactions between the N- and C-terminal domains, thereby permitting their reorientation, which in turn facilitates interaction with the target proteins at or near membranes. It is relevant in this connection that sorcin has the ability to interact with its partners by means of both the N- and C-terminal domain, as exemplified by annexin VII and the ryanodine receptor, respectively (23Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Mattei B. Noegel A.A. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 471: 197-200Google Scholar, 19Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Google Scholar). Site-specific mutants of EF1, EF2, and EF3 have been designed in which the canonical glutamate in the -Z position was changed into Gln or Ala. The respective mutant proteins, E53Q, E94A, E124A, have been characterized by determining their structural properties in solution and their affinity for Ca2+. Thereafter, the effect of the site-specific mutation on the capacity to interact with annexin VII and the ryanodine receptor was assessed. Substitution of the -Z glutamate in the first three EF-hands produces structural alterations of very limited extent. They can be appreciated only in the E124A mutant due to the involvement of Glu-124 in a network of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions that comprise the D helix. All the substitutions introduced affect the Ca2+ binding properties of sorcin. The effect is largest when EF3 is modified and decreases in the order EF2 and EF1. These findings indicate that EF3 and EF2 represent the functional pair and suggest that binding of Ca2+ to EF3 is the first step in sorcin activation. It is conceivable that Ca2+ binding at the EF3 site changes the conformation of Glu-124 and that this change is transmitted to EF2 via the long D helix. The subsequent step in the pathway could occur in the conventional manner by taking advantage of the canonical structural coupling between EF2 and EF1. This unusual mode of functional linkage may be operative in all PEF proteins given their high structural similarity and, hence, may represent a general property of the family. Cloning of Sorcin Mutants—The cDNA of Chinese hamster ovary sorcin, kindly provided by Dr. M. B. Meyers, was amplified by PCR using two oligonucleotides, one of which was designed to generate a novel NdeI restriction site at the 5′ end at the place of NcoI without altering the sequence within the gene. The amplified DNA thus obtained was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII and was inserted subsequently in a pET22 expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) that had been digested with the same enzymes. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by the PCR overlap extension mutagenesis method according to Higuchi et al. (24Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Google Scholar) using the proofreading enzyme Pfu DNA polymerase to avoid the addition of 3′-overhanging residues by Taq polymerase. The following oligonucleotides were used: N forward, 5′-GCGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′; C reverse, 5′-CAAGCTTTTAGACGGTCATGACAC-3′; E53Q forward, 5′-CAAATTGATGCTGATCAGTTGCAGAGATGTCTAAC-3′; E53Q reverse, 5′-GTTAGACATCTCTGCAACTGATCAGCATCAATTTG-3′; E94A forward, 5′-CACCATGGGATTCAATGCATTTAAAGAGCTC-3′; E94A reverse: 5′-GAGCTCTTTAAATGCATTGAATCCCATGGTG-3′; E124A forward, 5′-GGAACGGTGGATCCCCAGGCACTGCAGAAGGCTCTG-3′; E124A reverse, 5′-CGTCAGAGCCTTCTGCAGTGCCTGGGGATCCACCGT-3′. The complete mutated genes were digested with NdeI and HindIII and cloned into a pET22 expression vector. Expression and Purification of Wild-type Sorcin and Its Mutants— Chinese hamster ovary recombinant sorcin was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells and was purified as previously described (21Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a molar extinction coefficient on a monomer basis of 29,400 (21Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Google Scholar). The same purification procedure and the same extinction coefficient were used for the mutant proteins. Circular Dichroism Spectra—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter in the far UV (195–240 nm) and in the near UV (250–350 nm) region. The experiments at pH 7.5 were carried out at 20 °C in 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, and those at pH 6.0 were carried out in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer at 40 °C. The α-helical content was calculated from the ellipticity value at 222 nm according to Chou and Fasman (25Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-224Google Scholar). Determination of Ca2+ Affinity—Indirect titrations were carried out in a Fluoromax spectrofluorimeter in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 and 25 °C in the presence of the fluorescent calcium chelator Quin2, according to Bryant (26Bryant D.T.W. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 613-616Google Scholar). The excitation wavelength was 339 nm (slit width, 0.5 nm); the increment of emission intensity due to calcium binding to Quin2 was followed at 492 nm. Special care was taken to reduce Ca2+ contamination to 0.5–1.0 μm by treating the protein solutions and the glassware with Chelex 100, as recommended by André and Linse (27André I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Google Scholar). For each mutant four sets of independent experiments were carried out, which included control titrations of Quin2 alone and of native sorcin. At the end of each titration, the fluorescence intensity corresponding to zero free Ca2+ concentration was determined by the addition of 5 mm EGTA. The fluorescence intensity of Quin2 at high calcium concentrations was taken as the higher asymptote. To estimate the Ca2+ affinity constants of native sorcin and its mutants, each experimental set was fitted with the program CaLigator (27André I. Linse S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 305: 195-205Google Scholar); the choice between one and two binding constants was made on the basis of the χ2 values. Interaction of Wild-type Sorcin and Its Mutants with Annexin VII in Overlay Assay Experiments—Aliquots of purified wild-type sorcin and of the mutants were subjected to electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide gel under denaturing conditions (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride membranes (PVDF, Problott, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, pH 8.3) for 45 min at 100 mA (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Google Scholar). For Western blotting analysis, the PVDF membranes were incubated at room temperature with annexin VII (5 μg/ml) in 1% gelatin in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5) containing 10 μm or 500 μm CaCl2. Subsequently, the membranes were incubated with anti-annexin VII polyclonal antibody (dilution 1:3000) in 1% gelatin in TBST buffer. The blots were developed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase conjugate monoclonal anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in 1% gelatin in TBST. Control experiments ruled out the existence of cross-reactivity between sorcin and its mutants and the anti-annexin VII antibody (data not shown). Interaction of Wild-type Sorcin and Its Mutants with Annexin VII in Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Measurements—SPR experiments were carried out using a BIACORE X system (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Two N-terminal peptides of annexin VII were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (Cambridge, UK); to improve the peptide solubility and binding to the sensor chip, three lysine residues were added to the first 20 amino acids of annexin VII (MSYPGYPPTGYPPFPGYPPA). Peptide P1 contained three lysine residues at the N terminus of the sequence, whereas peptide P2 contained three lysine residues at the C-terminal end. The peptide purity was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The calculated isoelectric point of both P1 and P2 is 9.90, based on the program pI-tool (30Bjellqvist B. Hughes G.J. Ch Pasquali Paquet N. Ravier F. Sanchez J.-C. Frutiger S. Hochstrasser D.F. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1023-1031Google Scholar). The sensor chips (CM5, Biacore AB) were activated chemically by injection of 35 μl of a 1:1 mixture of N-hydroxysuccinimide (50 mm) and N-ethyl-N′-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (200 mm) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The N-terminal peptides of annexin VII were immobilized on the activated sensor chip via amine coupling. The reaction was carried out in 20 mm sodium acetate at pH 6.0, and the remaining ester groups were blocked by injecting 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride (35 μl). In control experiments, the sensor chip was treated as described above in the absence of peptide. The interaction of the immobilized annexin VII peptides with wild-type sorcin and its mutants was detected through mass concentration-dependent changes of the refractive index on the sensor chip surface. The changes in the observed SPR signal are expressed as resonance units (RU). Typically, a response change of 1000 RU corresponds to a change in the surface concentration on the sensor chip of about 1 ng of protein per mm2 (40Biacore AB BIAtechnology Handbook. Version AB, Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden1994: 4-5Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P-20 (HBS-P buffer), treated with Chelex 100 to eliminate contaminating calcium, and degassed. For the experiments as a function of Ca2+ concentration, calcium chloride or EGTA were added to the buffer. Measurements were performed at a flow rate of 20 μl/min with an immobilization level of the annexin VII N-terminal peptides corresponding to 200–1200 RU. Values of the plateau signal at steady state (Req) were calculated from kinetic evaluation of the sensorgrams using the BIAevaluation 3.0 software. Scatchard analysis of the dependence of Req on the concentration of wt sorcin was also performed to assess the equilibrium dissociation constant at 25 μm Ca2+. The amine coupling kit, the surfactant P-20, and the CM-5 sensor chip were purchased from Biacore AB; all the other reagents were high purity grade. Interaction of Wild-type Sorcin and Its Mutants with the Ryanodine Receptor—Aliquots of purified wild-type sorcin, EF1, EF2, and EF3 sorcin mutants were transferred to PVDF membranes as described above for the sorcin-annexin VII interaction. Incubation of the membranes with terminal cisternae vesicles from rabbit skeletal muscle enriched in Ryr (5 μg/ml) was likewise carried out in TBST buffer containing 10 μm or 500 μm CaCl2 as described above. The blots were incubated with an anti-Ryr monoclonal antibody (INALCO) and were developed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase conjugate monoclonal anti-mouse IgG. Control experiments ruled out the existence of cross-reactivity between sorcin and its mutants and the anti-Ryr antibody (data not shown). Structural Characterization of the Site-specific Sorcin Mutants—Far and near UV CD spectroscopy was used to assess the possible occurrence of structural changes in the mutated apoproteins. The experiments were carried out at pH 7.5 and at pH 6.0 since the x-ray crystal structure of the Ca2+ binding domain was obtained at the latter pH value (12Ilari A. Johnson K.A. Nastopoulos V. Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Colotti G. Tsernoglou D. Chiancone E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 447-458Google Scholar). Although sorcin operates in a medium containing about 1 mm Mg2+, this cation was not included in the buffers used throughout this study since previous work showed that Mg2+ has no effect on the structural and functional properties of the protein (21Meyers M.B. Zamparelli C. Verzili D. Dicker A.P. Blanck T.J.J. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 230-234Google Scholar). The far UV CD spectra of all the site-specific mutants under study are indistinguishable from those of native sorcin both at pH 6.0 and at pH 7.5 (data not shown). In the near UV CD region the spectrum of wild-type sorcin is negative and is characterized by two sharp bands at 262 and 268 nm attributed to phenylalanines, by a weaker band at 283 nm due to the tyrosyl fine structure (0–0 transition), and by a fairly intense, well resolved peak at 292 nm due to tryptophan residues (22Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Vecchini P. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 1-6Google Scholar). The two tryptophan residues, Trp-99 and Trp-105, which are located on the D helix (Fig. 1, B and C), both contribute to the observed signal. However, the contribution of Trp-99 is likely to be smaller since this residue is more exposed to solvent than Trp-105 (12Ilari A. Johnson K.A. Nastopoulos V. Verzili D. Zamparelli C. Colotti G. Tsernoglou D. Chiancone E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 447-458Google Scholar). The spectra of the mutant proteins are very similar to those of wild-type sorcin at both pH values with the exception of E124A, albeit only over the wavelength range 272–300 nm (Fig. 2). Thus, in the E124A mutant, the phenylalanine bands are unchanged, whereas the bands of tyrosine and tryptophan residues occur at the same wavelength as in the wild-type protein at both pH values but have a smaller amplitude. The difference is particularly significant for the tyrosine contribution. Sorcin precipitates upon binding of 2 Ca2+/monomer in the absence of target proteins due to the exposure of hydrophobic surfaces (22Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Vecchini P. Chiancone E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 1-6Google Scholar). The same phenomenon was observed also for the site-specific mutants under study. Therefore, the effect of calcium on the near UV CD spectra was not studied. Calcium Affinity of the Site-specific Sorcin Mutants—As for the wild-type protein (19Zamparelli C. Ilari A. Verzili D. Giangiacomo L. Colotti G. Pascarella S. Chiancone E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 658-666Google Scholar), the affinity for calcium could not be determined in direct fluorescence experiments since the fluorescence intensity is practically unchanged upon binding of 2 eq of Ca2+/monomer, and higher amounts of calcium lead to precipitation. Calcium affinity was assessed in indirect fluorescence titration experiments in the presence of the calcium chelator Quin2. The results obtained at pH 7.5 are presented in Fig. 3 in terms of the degree of saturation of Quin2 as a function of total calcium concentration. Simple inspection of the data indicates that in the mutants calcium affinity decreases with respect to the wild-type protein in the order E53Q > E94A > E124A. An important consequence of the occurrence of precipitation upon saturation of sorcin with 2 eq of Ca2+/monomer is that higher Ca2+/protein ratios cannot be scrutinized. Hence, one cannot establish whether more than two high affinity Ca2+-binding sites are present on the sorcin molecule and is forced to analyze the titration data in terms of a two-site model. In the framework of this minimum scheme and on the basis of the statistical parameters obtained from the fitting procedure, the behavior of the wild-type protein can be described with two apparent dissociation constants in the micromolar range, namely K1 = 0.42 ± 0.05 × 10–6m and K2 = 6.3 ± 4.1 × 10–6m, using a dissociation constant for the chelator of 60 nm at pH 7.4, 20 °C (31Tsien R.Y. Pozzan T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 172: 230-262Google Scholar). On the other hand the binding profiles of the mutants can be fitted satisfactorily by a single binding constant corresponding to 0.48 ± 0.13 × 10–6m in E53Q, 0.71 ± 0.14 × 10–6m in E94A, and 1.10 ± 0.27 × 10–6m in E124A. For the mutants the second constant cannot be determined with accuracy because it is below the resolution limits of the technique under the experimental conditions used (about 1 × 10–5m). If one assumes that the site-specific mutations studied introduce local structural perturbations, the observed changes in Ca2+ affinity can be taken to indicate that glutamic acid in the -Z position of the EF3 hand is more important than the corresponding residue of the EF2 and of the EF1 hands in determining the Ca2+-dependent conformational change that permits interaction with the target proteins. To prove this contention, binding of the mutant proteins with two physiological sorcin p"

Here we identify a novel gene of L1Md-A2 lineage in vascular smooth muscle cells and show that environmental hydrocarbons enhance gene expression and activate monomer-driven transcription via a redox-sensitive mechanism. Site-directed mutagenesis and progressive deletion analyses identified two antioxidant/electrophile response-like elements (5′-GTGACTCGAGC-3′) within the A2/3 and A3 region. These elements mediated activation, with the A3 monomer playing an essential role in transactivation. This signaling pathway may contribute to gene instability during the course of atherogenesis.

Retrotransposons are mobile retroelements that utilize reverse transcriptase and RNA intermediates to relocate to new locations within the cellular genome.

Skowronski J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1985; 10: 119-122Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In mouse, L1 is expressed at greater than 100,000 copies per genome and comprises 10% of genomic DNA (2Hutchison III, C.A. Hardies S.C. Loeb D.D. Shehee W.R. Edgell M.H. Berg D.E. Howe M.M. Mobile DNA. American Society of Microbiologists, Washington D. C.1989: 593-617Google Scholar). L1Md (L1 in Mus domesticus) is the major mouse retrotransposon, with randomly truncated sequences toward the 5′ end resulting in high frequency repeats of extreme 3′ sequences (3Voliva C.F. Jahn C.L. Comer M.B. Hutchison III, C.A. Edgell M.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8847-8859Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Unlike L1s in the human and rat, L1Md contains multiple copies of repeated sequences called monomers in their 5′ region (4Loeb D.D. Padgett R.W. Hardies S.C. Shehee W.R. Comer M.B. Edgell M.H. Hutchison III, C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). At least three subfamilies of L1Md, V, F, and A, have been identified in the mouse (5Adey N.B. Schichman S.A. Graham D.K. Peterson S.N. Edgell M.H. Hutchison III, C.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 778-789PubMed Google Scholar). The most ancient V subfamily lacks a 5′ monomer, whereas the monomers of the less actively transposing F subfamily and the youngest A subfamily have 206 and 208 bp, respectively (4Loeb D.D.

Monomers function as promoters, with increases in promoter activity as the number of monomers increase (10DeBerardinis R.J. Kazazian H.H. Genomics. 1999; 56: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Regardless of the number of monomers in an individual A- or F-type L1Md, monomers always contain two-thirds of full-length monomer at their most 5′ end tandem repeat, although their specific role in gene activation is unknown. Three A-type subfamily members have been described, L1Md-A2 with 4 and 2/3, L1Md-A13 with 2 and 2/3, and L1Md-9 with 1 and 2/3 copies of monomers (4Loeb D.D. Padgett R.W. Hardies S.C. Shehee W.R.

The structure of L1 in the mammalian genome may be represented by the well characterized L1Md-A2, which consists of six to seven kb including a 5′ untranslated region (UTR), two open reading frames (ORFs) (1137-bp ORF1 encoding ribonucleoprotein (12Kolosha V.O.

A few bp target direct repeats are always found before and after the 5′ UTR and 3′ UTR, respectively, a feature consistent with active transposition into new locations.

Genet. 2001; 27: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) describing transcriptional interference by somatically active retrotransposons as epigenetic mediators of phenotypic variance among mammals raises important questions about their impact in development and progression of human disease. Previous studies in this laboratory (18Lu K.P. Ramos K.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have shown that benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon carcinogen and atherogen, activates L1Md expression in mouse vascular smooth muscle cells. L1Md activation is also elicited by oxidative metabolites of the parent hydrocarbon, suggesting that modulation of redox homeostasis mediates epigenetic disruption of gene expression and possibly DNA damage (19Lu K.P. Hallberg L.M. Tomlinson J. Ramos K.S. Mutation Res. 2000; 454: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here we identify for the first time a novel A-type L1Md in mouse vascular smooth muscle cells that contains 3 and 2/3 copies of A-monomers within the 5′ regulatory region. PCR analysis of genomic DNA showed tissue-specific distribution of the gene, with strong amplification signals detected in vascular smooth muscle cells, and to a lesser extent mammary gland and kidney. Sequence alignment to L1Md-A2 indicated that a full-length monomer equivalent (the entire 140-bp incomplete monomer A2/3 and the 68 bp from adjacent first full monomer A4) is absent in the most 5′ end tandem repeat of the regulatory region. This element, named L1Md-A3.6, preserved its promoter activity and was inducible by carcinogenic environmental hydrocarbons via a redox-sensitive mechanism involving ARE/EpRE-like sequences. Site-directed mutagenesis and progressive deletion analyses showed that: 1) promoter activity increases as the number of monomers increase, 2) the A2/3 monomer in genomic context may inhibit gene expression, 3) A1 alone lacks promoter activity but may assist in monomer-driven transactivation, 4) mutation of both ARE/EpRE-like sites within A2/3 and A3 markedly reduce inducible activity, and 5) mutation at A3 alone significantly reduced BaP inducibility. Collectively, these data suggest that oxidative stress plays a significant role in the activation of a novel member of the A-type L1Md subfamily in vascular smooth muscle cells. Cell Culture and Genomic DNA Isolation—Aortic smooth muscle cells isolated from C57BL/6J mice were seeded at 100 cells/mm2 in 10-cm dishes and maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. At 85% confluence, genomic DNA was extracted using DNAzol genomic DNA isolation reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Briefly, 1 ml of DNAzol was added to lyse the cells. The cell lysate was passed through a pipette several times and collected into a 1.5-μl microtube. Genomic DNA was precipitated from the lysate by addition of 500 μl of 100% ethanol, mixed by inversion five to eight times, and incubated at room temperature for 3 min followed by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 5 min at 25 °C. The DNA pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of 95% ethanol and solubilized in distilled water. For analyses of tissue distribution, genomic DNA from mouse aortic smooth muscle cells, mammary gland, liver, uterus, ovary, and kidney was extracted with a PUREGENE DNA isolation kit (Gentra) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Polymerase Chain Reaction—Three sets of primers were designed using oligo 4.0 (National Biosciences) based on the published L1Md-A2 sequence. Region 1 primer set (forward, 5′-CCCAACATAGAGTCCTGA-3′; reverse, 5′-AGTGGGCAGAGTATTCTC-3′) was designed to generate a 1114-bp PCR product from nucleotide (nt) 515 to 1628 of L1Md-A2 and spanning the complete four and 2/3 A-monomers. Region 2 primer set (forward, 5′-GCCCTTCTGGACTTATCTCTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTGCGGGTGTCAGGCGACTCAG-3′) was used to generate a 1008-bp fragment from nt 477 to 1484 of L1Md-A2 covering 3 and 2/3 A-monomers. Region 3 primer set (forward, 5′-TGCCCACTTTCTCCCTACCT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCTTTTCCCCACTTTCTCCTC-3′) was designed to generate a 972-bp fragment from nt 4856 to 5827 of L1Md-A2 ORF2 region. Each PCR reaction contained the following: 20 μm dNTPs, 200 pmol of each primer, 0.02 units/μlof Taq DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 1× MgCl2 containing PCR buffer, and various amounts (800–1 ng) of genomic DNA. Amplification reactions were performed for 25 cycles, and each cycle consisted of a 30-s denaturation at 94 °C, 1-min annealing at 60 °C, and 2-min extension at 68 °C. For analyses of tissue distribution, 1 mg of genomic DNA was amplified in a 50-ml reaction containing 200 μm dNTPs, 500 pmol of primer (upper primer, 5′-AAAAAGCTTCCCAACATAGAGTCCTGA-3′; lower primer, 5′-AAAAAGCTTAGTGGGCAGAGTATTCTC-3′), 0.025 units/μl AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 1× MgCl2 containing PCR buffer. Amplification reactions were performed for 30 cycles, and each cycle consisted of a 45-s denaturation at 95 °C, 1-min annealing at 60 °C, and 1-min, 15-s extensions at 68 °C following initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min. Plasmid Construction and Sequencing—pGB3.6–11 containing a full-length 5′ tandem repeat (designed to generate nt 515–1628 of L1Md-A2) was constructed by first cloning the PCR product generated from the HindIII restriction site attached to the 5′ end of Region 1 primer set M13002–18H (forward, 5′-AAAAGCTTGCCCTTCTGGACTTATCTCTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-AAAAGCTTTTGCGGGTGTCAGGCGACTCAG-3′) into HindIII digested blunt end linearized PCR-TRAP vector (GenHunter Corp., Nashville, TN). After a successful clone was confirmed by a colony-PCR method using a primer set that flanks the cloning site of the PCR-TRAP vector, the insert fragment was retrieved by digestion of the plasmid with HindIII restriction enzyme and subcloned into pGL3 basis luciferase reporter vector (Promega). All plasmids with correct inserts were confirmed by sequencing from both ends to ensure that the correct sequence was cloned. Transient Transfection Assay—Mouse vascular smooth muscle cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells in 12-well plates and maintained at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Medium 199 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. After seeding for 24 h, cells were transfected with pGB3.6–11 or pGB3.6–8, plasmids containing the sense or antisense strand of Region 1 product, respectively, or mutant plasmids, for 2 h. Briefly, 2 μg of plasmid DNA and 0.5 μg of β-galactosidase (pcDNA/His/lacz) were mixed with 400 μl of serum-deprived OPTIMEM-1 medium. Then, 7.5 μl of TransFast transfection reagent (Promega) was added, vortexed immediately, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Growth medium was carefully removed, and 400 μl of TransFast reagent (Promega)/DNA mixture added to each well. Plates were returned to the incubator for 2 h. At the end of the incubation, transfected cells were recovered in 1 ml of Medium 199 supplemented with 10% serum for 24 h followed by challenge with BaP (0.3, 3, 30 μm), TCDD (0.1, 1, 10 nm), or H2O2 (25, 50, 100 μm) for 24 h. For antioxidant inhibition studies, cells were pre-treated with 0.5 mm N-acetylcysteine or 0.01 μm PDTC for 3 or 6 h, respectively, before challenge with carcinogens. To harvest the cells, transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 175 μl of 1× reporter lysis buffer, and collected into a microtube. The suspension was then incubated at room temperature for 15 min followed by one cycle of quick freeze-thaw in liquid nitrogen and water at room temperature. The resulting cell lysate were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 1 min. For measurements of luciferase activity, 30 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a 96-well plate and read at 420 mm in a plate reader. For β-galactosidase activity, 30 μl of cells lysate was mixed with 70 μl of substrate and incubated at room temperature for 5 min followed by addition of 100 μl of accelerate II buffer (Promega) and read in a plate reader. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Deletion Analysis—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a GeneEditor in vitro site-directed mutagenesis system (Promega) according to manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, a 4-bp (boldface in the mutagenesis oligo) mutation was designed to generate mutations within the ARE/EpRE-like consensus sequence 5′-GTGACNNNAGC-3′ of pGB3.6–11 using the mutagenesis oligo 5′-CCTTCCGCTCGACTCTGCAGTCGAGCCCCGGGCTA-3′. PstI and XhoI restriction sites were engineered to facilitate screening of successful mutant clones. As a result, pMut-12 plasmid containing both ARE/EpRE mutations, one each within A2/3 and A3, respectively, was generated. pMut-4 plasmid contains an additional nonspecific mutation within A2 because of high sequence similarity among monomers. For deletion analyses, pWtA2/3 and pWtA321 plasmids were first recovered from pGB3.6–11 by HindIII digestion followed by SacII digestion to separate the A2/3 region from the A3, 2, and 1 monomers. A2/3 and A321 fragments were then blunt end cloned into HindIII digested pGL3 basic luciferase reporter vectors to give the pWtA2/3 and pWtA321 plasmids, respectively. Deletion plasmids pMutA2/3 and pMutA321 were generated from pMut-12 using the same strategy. HindII/SacII digested A321 fragment from pGB3.6–11 was then used as PCR template for pA32, pA21, and pA1. The deletion construct pA32 was generated using upper primer 5′-AAAAAGCTTGTGCCTGCCCCAAT CCAATCGCGCGG-3′ and lower primer 5′-AAAAAGCTTTGTGTTCCACTCAC CAGAGGTCTTAG-3′. Deletion plasmids pA21 and pA1 were generated from lower primer 5′-AAAAAGCTTTGTGTTCCACTCACTAGAGGTCTTAG-3′ in conjunction with upper primers 5′-AAAAAGCTTGTGCCTGCCCCAATCCAATCGCGCGG-3′ and 5′-AAAAAGCTTGCGCCTACCCCAATCCAATCGCGTGG-3′, respectively. All mutations and deletions were confirmed by DNA sequencing prior to transfection. Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.) from serum-stimulated mouse vascular smooth muscle cells treated with 3 μm BaP or an equivalent volume of Me2SO for 8 h following growth arrest in 0.1% serum containing medium 199 for 48 h. Primers were designed using Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Location and sequences of primers were as follows: 5′ UTR (nt 307 to 383 of L1Md-A2) forward, 5′-ATTGAAGAGGGACAGAAAAACAAAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-ACTGTGGTCAGGGCACAAATG-3′; ORF2 (nt 5896 to 5999 of L1Md-A2) forward, 5′-AATCGACAAATGGGACCTAATGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTAAAGATCCTTTCCCAATCTGTTG-3′; internal control gene 18S (nt 1679 to 1748 of GenBank™ accession number X00686) forward, 5′-AGTCCCTGCCCTTTGTACACA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGATCCGAGGGCCTCACTA-3′. Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the ABI-PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Two μg of genomic DNA was first reverse-transcribed to cDNA using TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a reaction volume of 100 μl containing 1× TaqMan RT buffer, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 500 μm each dNTP, 2.5 μm reverse primers, 0.4 units of RNase inhibitor, and 1.25 units of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase under conditions of 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 30 min, followed by 95 °C for 5 min in a thermocycler. Five μl of cDNA was then amplified in a total volume of 50 μl, containing 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix and 2.5 to 45 μm reverse and forward primer at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 15-s denaturing at 95 °C and 1 min annealing at 95 °C in the ABI-PRISM 7700. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Sequence Alignment—Sequences were aligned, and consensus sequences were determined using MacVector 7.0 (Oxford Molecular Group). Accession Number—The L1Md-A2 GenBank™ accession number is M13002, and for L1Md-A3.6 it is AF502598. Identification of a Novel L1Md-A2 in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells—The full and partial 5′ regulatory region of L1Md-A2 were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA based on GenBank™ published sequences. The ORF2 region of L1Md-A2 was amplified as a reference control. The location of primers and size of expected products is shown in Fig. 1a. Amplicons from Regions 1 (Fig. 1b) and 2 (Fig. 1c), but not Region 3 (Fig. 1d), were ∼200 bp shorter than expected. This finding suggests that L1Md-A2 in murine vascular smooth muscle cells is missing one full monomer equivalent (208 bp), an interpretation consistent with evolutionary pressures known to give rise to genes truncated in their 5′ tandem repeat sequence. The 5′ end truncation of the gene was consistent with relative increases in efficiency of PCR amplification as the template region progressed to the 3′ end of the gene. To identify the missing sequence, a PCR product of Region 1 was regenerated with HindIII restriction sites at both 5′ ends to facilitate cloning. The resulting product was run on agarose gel to confirm the absence of ∼200 bp before cloning into a HindIII digested PCR-TRAP vector for sequencing. Fig. 2a shows the complete sequence of the Region 1 PCR product. Direct sequence alignment of the Region 1 PCR product with the corresponding L1Md-A2 sequence showed 100% homology at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the monomer (Fig. 2b). Interestingly, sequence alignment revealed that the first 208 bp spanning the region between A2/3 and A4 of the parent template were missing in the vascular smooth muscle gene, with only 2-, 1-, 1-, and 1-bp mismatches for the A4, A3, A2, and A1 monomers, respectively (Fig. 2c). These findings identified a novel A2 lineage L1Md retrotransposon that lacks a full-length monomer equivalent of 208 bp, specifically, 140 bp of A2/3 and 68 bp of 5′ A4 from L1Md-A2. Thus, the novel A-type transposon sequence was named L1Md-A3.6. Next, genomic DNA from various tissues was examined to evaluate the tissue specificity of this element. PCR analysis showed tissue-specific distribution of the gene, with strong amplification signals detected in vascular smooth muscle cells, and to a lesser extent mammary gland and kidney, but not in liver, uterus, or ovary.Fig. 2Identification of a novel retrotransposon in C57BL6J vascular smooth muscle cells. a, complete sequence of Region 1 PCR product (L1Md-A3.6). b, summary map showing homologies between L1Md-A2 and L1Md-A3.6.

The sequence is shown and numbered for monomer regions of L1Md-A2 and L1Md-A3. Notice that the entire A2/3 monomer (1–140 nt) and the partial A4 monomer (1–68 nt) were deleted in L1Md-A3.6. The numbers of mismatched base pairs for each individual segment are summarized in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) BaP-induced L1Md-A3.6 Activation—Real-time RT-PCR is a high throughput technology that allows rapid and sensitive detection of gene expression (36Bieche I.

Esteban R. Guardia J. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 327-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because families of retrotransposons are known to be conserved at the 3′ end and differ at their 5′ untranslated region (38Speek M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that the newly identified L1Md-A3.6 evolved from L1Md-A2. Therefore, real-time RT-PCR was performed to evaluate inducibility of L1Md-A3.6 in response to BaP activation of ORF2 in L1Md-A2. A region containing DNA sequence upstream of monomers was used as control. The normalized amount of ORF2 for each treatment was determined by dividing the expression values for each treatment by the amount of corresponding endogenous reference 18S. The average of triplicate BaP-treated cultures was divided by the control average to give the relative amount of ORF2 in BaP-treated over Me2SO control cells. The amplification profiles for both ORF2 and 18S, and the summary of -fold induction of the gene is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, a and b, respectively. As expected, no amplification was detected for the 5′ end tandem repeat promoter sequence (Fig. 4b). In contrast, BaP treatment significantly increased expression of L1Md-A2 ORF2 region, confirming that L1Md-A3.6 is a member of the L1Md-A2 family with one monomer short in its 5′ tandem repeat region.Fig. 4Amplification efficiency of the ORF2 region of L1Md-A2. Real-time RT-PCR was performed as described under “Materials and Methods” using primer pairs as listed. One to 50 ng of chromosomal DNA-free total RNA was used for each standard curve. Five μl of 100-μl first strand cDNA generated from 2-μg total RNA from 8-h BaP- or Me2SO-treated vascular smooth muscle cells were amplified with SYBR Green dye in ABI-PRISM 7700. International control gene 18S was amplified in the same plate.

To understand the regulation of retrotransposon activation in vascular smooth muscle cells by carcinogen treatment and to determine whether L1Md promoter activity is intact regardless of monomer shortening in the 5′ tandem repeat, L1Md-A3.6 was subcloned into a luciferase reporter vector pGL3 basic vector and used in transient transfection assays. Fig. 5a shows the luciferase reporter activity of L1Md-A3.6 in mouse vascular smooth muscle cells. L1Md-A3.6 preserved its promoter function, such that luciferase activity was detected in both pGB3.6–8 and pGB3.6–11, plasmids containing the L1Md-A3.6 sequence in reverse and correct orientation, respectively. The promoter activity in pGB3.6–8, although considerably reduced, is consistent with a report showing that the retrotransposon promoter in antisense orientation is capable of disrupting neighboring genes (38Speek M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the inducibility of L1Md-A3.6, pGB3.6–11 transfected cells were challenged with 0.3, 3, and 30 μm BaP or an equivalent volume of Me2SO as vehicle control for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 5b, BaP treatment increased luciferase activity in a concentration-dependent manner relative to Me2SO controls. When transfected cells were pre-treated for 3 h with N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant precursor of cellular glutathione, marked inhibition of BaP-induced gene transcription was observed. Thus, an oxidative mechanism may mediate activation of the gene by the carcinogen. To test this hypothesis, the inhibitory effects of the antioxidant PDTC were examined. Pre-treatment of vascular smooth muscle cells with PDTC for 6 h also prevented activation of the gene (Fig. 5b). Oxidative stress is associated with retrotransposon activation in plants (20Ikeda K. Nakayashiki H. Takagi M. Tosa Y. Mayama S. Mol. Genet. Genom. 2001; 266: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); however, to our knowledge, this is the first report showing redox-depende"

Furthermore, Western blotting combined with mass spectrometry revealed the occurrence of numerous isoforms of pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits, with subtle changes in post-translational modifications. This comparative proteomic approach gives the first insight for nuclear encoded proteins that undergo the largest quantitative changes, and pinpoints new potential molecular partners involved in the cascade of events that connect genotype to phenotype.

Mitochondria are the center of numerous metabolic functions of primary importance to the cell. They are responsible for the major ATP synthesis pathway and thus deliver energy through the activity of respiratory chain complexes and ATP synthase, all located in the inner mitochondrial (mt) 1The abbreviations used are: mt, mitochondrial; MERRF, Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fibers; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; MS, mass spectrometry; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; DTT, dithiothreitol; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; COX, cytochrome c oxidase. membrane. Mitochondria also contain major catabolic pathways including the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation, part of the urea cycle, and a number of biosynthetic pathways such as those for heme, ubiquinol, and cardiolipin (1Scheffler I. Mitochondria. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar). To fulfill these functions, mitochondria produce a subset of 13 proteins by translation of their own genes and import a large number of proteins encoded by the nuclear genome (estimated 400 –2000), translated within the cytosol. Among these are numerous proteins allowing maintenance and expression of the mt genome (replicase, transcription factors, and translation proteins). Thus, mt functions depend on well coordinated cross-talks between mt and nuclear genomes, allowing for a controlled balance between mitochondria encoded and nuclear encoded proteins and associated enzymatic activities. Mt genomes are very sensitive to mutations (2Kogelnik A.M. Lott M.T. Brown M.D. Navathe S.B. Wallace D.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 112-115Google Scholar, 3Ingman M. Kaessmann H. Pääbo S. Gyllenstein U. Nature. 2000; 408: 708-713Google Scholar, 4Servidei S. Neuromuscul. Disord. 2001; 11: 508-513Google Scholar). In the case of human, as many as 150 point mutations have been correlated already with various neuromuscular and neurodegenerative disorders (5Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Google Scholar, 6Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Google Scholar, 7Chinnery P.F. Turnbull D.M. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 425-432Google Scholar, 8DiMauro S. Andreu A. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 431-441Google Scholar). tRNA genes, which correspond only to about 10% of the mt genome, are particularly sensitive because they host about 80 of the known pathogenesis-associated mutations. Genotype/phenotype relationships for these disorders are complex because one mutation can be related to several disorders, and conversely a same disorder can arise from several different mutations. Due to the central role of tRNAs in protein synthesis (9Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar), defects in structure/function relationships of mutant tRNAs have been sought (e.g. reviewed in Refs. 5Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Google Scholar, 6Wallace D.C. Science. 1999; 283: 1482-1488Google Scholar, 8DiMauro S. Andreu A. Brain Pathol. 2000; 10: 431-441Google Scholar, 10Chomyn A. Am. J. Hum.

Rep. 2002; 22: 81-98Google Scholar, 13Florentz C. Sissler M. Lapointe J. Brakier-Gingras L. Translation Mechanisms. Landes Biosciences, Georgetown, TX2003Google Scholar). The rate of synthesis of the 13 mitochondria-encoded proteins is decreased, and tRNA maturation, stability, post-transcriptional modification, structure, aminoacylation, and/or codon reading properties can be affected. However, depending on the specific case studied, distinct results were observed, confirming a complex relationship between genotypes and phenotypes and suggesting the contribution of additional factors to the expression of the disease (14Jacobs H.T. Holt I.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 463-465Google Scholar). Furthermore, in some instances no defect in protein synthesis was observed, a discovery in support of mediators outside mt translation (15Janssen G. Maassen J. van den Ouweland J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29744-29748Google Scholar). Comparative proteomics is a powerful approach to investigate quantitative variations in several hundred proteins at once (16Blackstock W.P. Weir M.P. Trends Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 121-127Google Scholar, 17Celis J. Kruhoffer M. Gromova I. Frederiksen C. Ostergaard M. Thykjaer T. Gromov P. Yu J. Palsdottir H. Magnusson N. Orntoft T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 2-16Google Scholar). Its application to human mitochondria would enlarge insight into unexpected consequences of a single point mutation in a tRNA gene on the global mt protein content. Such an approach particularly enables the analysis of the fate of nuclear encoded proteins located in mitochondria. Investigation of human mt tRNA gene mutations suffers so far from the absence of animal model systems (e.g. Refs. 18Jacobs H.T. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 653-660Google Scholar, 19Larsson N. Rustin P. Trends Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 578-581Google Scholar, 20Silva J. Larsson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1555: 106-110Google Scholar). An initial proteomic study performed on mitochondria from sibling cybrid cell lines, in the presence or absence of a single point mutation in one mt tRNA gene, has already proven the feasibility and the potential impact of such an approach for the investigation of mt tRNA disorders (21Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Carte N. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 144-150Google Scholar). In mitochondria carrying tRNALys gene mutation A8344G, associated with Myoclonic Epilepsy and Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF syndrome (22Shoffner J. Lott M. Lezza A.M.S. Seibel P. Ballinger S.W. Wallace D.C. Cell. 1990; 61: 931-937Google Scholar)), a large decrease in the steady-state levels of two nuclear encoded subunits of cytochrome c oxidase, a respiratory chain complex, was identified upon simple visual comparison of two-dimensional PAGE (isoelectrofocusing/SDS-PAGE) followed by mass spectrometric assignment. Here the cybrid model system was further explored by a detailed computer-assisted quantitative comparison of over 800 spots obtained from wild-type and mutation A8344G-carrying mitochondria. This first large scale quantitative analysis of the protein profile of mitochondria representative of a tRNA disorder, using cybrid cell lines as a model system, revealed that in addition to the 13 mitochondria encoded proteins, all known to be affected, several nuclear encoded proteins of mt location undergo quantitative and/or qualitative changes. The proteomic approach enlarges the view of the status of a disease-carrying cell, highlighting new molecular species relevant to perturbations within the whole cell, beyond the consequences of the primary molecular impact of a mutation on the tRNA structure/function relationship in translation. Understanding how each of these species affects the cell will shed new light on the genotype/phenotype relationships of mt disorders. Although some of the affected proteins may contribute to the expression of the disease, others may be compensating. Human osteosarcoma-derived cybrid cell lines R2-1A and R1C3 were a kind gift of A. Chomyn and G. Attardi (California Institute of Technology, Pasadena). Cell line R2-1A carried the wild-type mt tRNALys gene in homoplasmic form, and cell line R1C3, associated with MERRF disease, carries an A to G transition at position 8344 in this gene in homoplasmic form (23Helm M. Florentz C. Chomyn A. Attardi G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 756-763Google Scholar). Cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml bromodeoxyuridine at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 and 85% humidity. R2-1A cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/10 ml of medium/10-cm diameter Petri dish, and R1C3 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells/10 ml/10 cm diameter. Upon reaching confluence, cells were passed (not more than 4 or 5 times), and 50 –100 dishes, containing ∼4 × 106 cells each (confluent culture), were harvested for mitochondria isolation. Stability of the cell lines was verified in regard to the tRNALys and tRNALeu(UUR) gene sequences, which were found to be unchanged over the period of experimentation. Mitochondria were purified according to established procedures (21Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Carte N. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 144-150Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cybrid cells were detached by trypsinization, centrifuged, and washed twice with cell dissociation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.5 mm NaH2PO4). Cell pellets were resuspended in 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 2 mm EDTA (isolation buffer). Cytosolic membranes were permeabilized by a short digitonin treatment (1 min on ice, 0.04 to 0.1 mg/100 mg of total protein as measured by the Bradford technique). Permeabilization efficiency was monitored under the microscope by trypan blue staining. Cells were centrifuged, suspended in the same buffer without digitonin, and broken in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer with a rotating pestle up to ∼80% cell breakage. The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and large debris. The supernatants were recovered and centrifuged again at 900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. This centrifugation step was repeated until the pellet became invisible (about 7– 8 times). The final supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 10,000 × g to collect mitochondria. Mitochondrial pellets were washed once, then resuspended in a small volume of isolation buffer, and stored at –80 °C. Protein content was estimated by the Bradford method used directly with mitochondria. Mitochondria per cell, estimated by citrate synthase activity (units per mg of total cellular protein content), was found to be similar in both cell lines (∼125 milliunits/mg). For analytical gels, samples consisted of 50 –150 μg of mt protein in 100 μl of isolation buffer. For preparative gels, samples consisted of 500 μg of protein. Mitochondria were solubilized by addition of 400 μl of “lysis buffer” containing 9 m urea, 2.5 m thiourea, 5% CHAPS, 12.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5% carrier ampholytes (pH 3–10) to the 100-μl mt suspension. The mixture was sonicated for 3 min before application to the strip. Samples were deposited on linearly immobilized 17 cm long, pH 5– 8 IPG strips (Bio-Rad), followed by passive overnight rehydration at 22 °C. Strips were prevented from dehydration and oxidation by covering with mineral oil (Bio-Rad). Isoelectrofocusing was performed for a total of 53,600 V-h at 22 °C (Bio-Rad, Protean IEF Cell) by application of 300 V for 2 h (to remove salt), 1500 V for 2 h (fast increasing slope), 3000 V for 16 h (focusing), and 500 V for 4 h (stabilization). Strips were equilibrated 2 times for 15 min in 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 6 m urea, 30% glycerol, and 2.5% SDS, first with 65 mm DTT (reduction step), and finally with 216 mm iodoacetamide (alkylation step). The second dimension was run after fixing each strip with 1% low melting point bromphenol blue containing agarose solution, on top of a 20 × 20-cm 10% acrylamide gel, cast in 0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1. Protein samples were electrophoresed using Tris taurine (0.05 m Tris, 0.2 m taurine, 0.1% SDS) as upper buffer (cathode), and Tris glycine (0.05 m Tris, 0.4 m glycine, 0.1% SDS) as lower buffer (anode) (21Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Carte N. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 144-150Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed at 40 mA/gel until the bromphenol blue reached the bottom of the gel (about 5 h). This allowed resolution of low molecular mass proteins down to 7 kDa. Proteins from wild-type and MERRF mitochondria were always run together in the same electrophoresis tank. Silver Staining—Gels loaded with 100 –150 μg of proteins were stained according to Ref. 21Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Carte N. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 144-150Google Scholar. Gels were fixed overnight with 5% acetic acid, 30% ethanol, sensitized with 0.02% sodium thiosulfate for 1 min, stained with 0.2% AgNO3 in ultrapure water for 90 min, developed in 4% potassium carbonate, 0.25 ml/liter formaldehyde, 0.025% sodium thiosulfate. Staining reaction was stopped by 4% Tris base (m/v), 2% acetic acid treatment. Gels were rinsed, scanned (GS-710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer, Bio-Rad), and dried. This staining method is sensitive enough to detect about 800 spots on gels loaded with 100 μgof protein. For gels loaded with 50 –70 μg of proteins, a more sensitive silver staining method (PlusOne Kit, Amersham Biosciences) was applied according to manufacturer's instructions. Colloidal Blue (G-250) Staining—Preparative gels loaded with 500 μg of proteins were fixed 3 times for 30 min with 30% ethanol, 2% phosphoric acid. Gels were rinsed 3 times for 20 min with 2% phosphoric acid and then equilibrated with a solution containing 2% phosphoric acid, 18% ethanol, 15% ammonium sulfate for 30 min. Colloidal Blue G (Sigma) was added to the equilibration solution at a final concentration of 0.02%. Gels were stained for 24 –36 h, washed with water to decrease background, and scanned. Finally spots of interest were excised with caution to avoid keratin contamination and stored at –20 °C until mass spectrometry analysis. For quantitative analysis, gels were silver-stained. This method has a more restricted linear range compared with colloidal blue staining but requires about 10 times less protein for detection, an important factor when preparing mitochondria from adherent cell cultures. Comparison of spot intensities in two independent experiments revealed by either silver or colloidal blue staining lead to the same quantitative results except in the case of fairly dark (still not saturated) spots. In this latest case, intensity differences for a same spot in wild-type and mutant mitochondria were greater in blue gels. Thus, silver staining may tend to underestimate some of the spot intensity increases in two-dimensional maps. Quantitative, computer-assisted gel analysis was carried out with the help of PD-QUEST software (Bio-Rad). Each scanned image was converted to gray scale pixel values by the program. All spot values were normalized according to total density in the gel image, which allows the precise comparison of gels even with different (high and low) backgrounds. Eleven gel couples (wild-type and MERRF mitochondria), run in parallel, were analyzed. After automatic detection, spots resulting from non-protein sources (e.g. dust, silver particles, and scratches) were filtered out. Operator intervention was required to set landmarks on each gel for accurate cross-gel image matching. This matching procedure resulted in a “master gel” containing all spot information of both gels (spot size, density, quantity in volume (pixel = OD × spot surface), etc.). Spot volumes were compared across 11 “master” gels for each matched spot, and data were analyzed under Excel. Ratios of protein quantities (spot volumes) were established for corresponding spots (wild-type and mutation carrying sample), and mean values as well as standard errors were calculated. Up-regulated spots were analyzed after excision from gels containing mutated mitochondria, and down-regulated spots were analyzed from wild-type mitochondria gels. In-gel Digestion—Reduction was achieved by a 1-h treatment of the gel spots in 10 mm DTT at 57 °C. Alkylation reaction was performed using 25 mm iodoacetamide for 45 min at room temperature and protected from light. Tryptic digestion was performed in 12.5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega, V5111) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 (freshly diluted) at 35 °C overnight. Gel pieces were centrifuged, and 5 μl of 25% H2O, 70% acetonitrile, 5% HCOOH were added to extract peptides. For MALDI-MS analysis, the supernatant volume was reduced under nitrogen flow to 4 μl; 1 μlofH2O, 5% HCOOH were added, and 0.5 μl of the mix were used for analysis. For nano-LC-MS-MS, the supernatant solvent was completely evaporated in order to remove all acetonitrile from the sample. Then 10 μl of H2O, 5% HCOOH were added and injected in the high pressure liquid chromatography system. MALDI-MS—For MALDI mass spectrometry, mass measurements were carried out on a Bruker BIFLEX III™ MALDI-TOF equipped with the SCOUT™ High Resolution Optics with X-Y multisample probe and gridless reflector. Internal calibration was performed with tryptic peptides coming from autodigestion of trypsin, with monoisotopic masses at m/z = 842.51, 1045.564, and 2211.105. Monoisotopic peptide masses were assigned and used for data base searches. These files were then fed into the search engine MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK). The data were searched against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence data base with trypsin plus potentially two missed cleavages. All proteins present in NCBI were taken into account without any pI and molecular weight restrictions. Some variable modifications were taken into account, like methionine oxidation, cysteine carbamidomethylation, and serine, threonine, or tyrosine phosphorylations. Detection of phosphorylated peptides resulted in matches at 80 Da higher masses/phosphate group, compared with non-phosphorylated peptides. The peptide mass error was limited to 50 ppm. Nano-LC-MS-MS—Nanoscale capillary liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS-MS) analysis of the digested proteins were performed using a CapLC capillary LC system (Micromass, Manchester, UK) coupled to a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-TOF II, Micromass). The LC-MS union was made with a PicoTip (New Objective, Woburn, MA) fitted on a ZSPRAY (Micromass, Manchester, UK) interface. Chromatographic separations were conducted on a reversed phase capillary column (Pepmap C18, 75 μm inner diameter, 15 cm length, LC Packings) with a 200 nl/min flow. The gradient profile used consisted of a linear gradient from 95% A (H2O, 0.05% HCOOH) to 45% B (acetonitrile, 0.05% HCOOH) over 35 min followed by a linear gradient to 95% B for 1 min. Mass data acquisitions were piloted by MassLynx software (Micromass, Manchester, UK) using automatic switching between MS and MS-MS modes. Mass data collected during a LC-MS/MS analysis were processed and converted into a .PKL file to be submitted to the search software MASCOT (Matrix Science, London, UK). Searches were done with a tolerance on mass measurement of 0.25 Da in MS mode and 0.5 Da in MS/MS mode. Mitochondrial proteins derived from four independent preparations (10 μg) were run on one-dimensional 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10 × 8 cm) and transferred to Immobilon P membrane (Millipore). After saturation with 5% milk powder in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, reaction with specific antibodies (dilution 1:1000) was performed. The three different antibodies tested were anti-bovine pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 (gift of Dr. G. Lindsay), anti-bovine mt elongation factor (gift of Dr. L. Spremulli), and anti-human lysyltRNA synthetase (gift of Dr. K. Shiba). Each antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution. Secondary antibody was horseradish peroxidase coupled anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:5000), and reaction was revealed by the ECL method (Amersham Biosciences). After exposure, quantitative comparison of wild-type and mutant samples was performed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Western blotting was also performed on two-dimensional gels loaded with 50 –250 μg of mt proteins and probed with either of the three antibodies. Treatment of Immobilon membrane was as described above. Total and basal activities were assayed by the release of 14CO2 from [1-14C]pyruvic acid, as described (24Clot J. Benelli C. Fouque F. Rozenn B. Durand D. Postel-Vinay M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 1258-1262Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Cell lines were grown on a 6-ml dish until confluent. Each dish was harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. For the assay, cells were thawed and gently sonicated (4 pulses, microtip 20, 50%). Three dishes of each cell type were pooled, and the assay was performed in triplicate. Cells were preincubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 0.04 mm MgCl2 and 0.04 mm CaCl2 (basal activity) or with 16 mm MgCl2 and 0.4 mm CaCl2 (total activity). They were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C as described (24Clot J. Benelli C. Fouque F. Rozenn B. Durand D. Postel-Vinay M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 1258-1262Google Scholar). The reaction was stopped with 0.1 ml of 50% trichloroacetic acid and left at room temperature for 90 min to allow capture of CO2. Model System—The protein content of mitochondria isolated from sibling cybrid cell lines, homoplasmic either for wild-type or for the MERRF mutation A8344G in the tRNALys gene, has been compared. The origin of both cybrid cell lines is an osteosarcoma cell line devoid of mitochondria, fused with enucleated myoblasts of a MERRF patient carrying mutation A8344G in a heteroplasmic form (25Chomyn A. Meola G. Bresolin N. Lai S.T. Scarlato G. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2236-2244Google Scholar). Emerging cybrid cells were selected for the presence (R1C3 cells) or the absence (R2-1A cells) of mutation A8344G in the tRNALys gene in homoplasmic form. In consequence, these cell lines have the same nuclear background and are distinguished only by the presence or absence of mutation A8344G in their mtDNA. This model system has already been genetically and biochemically characterized and used to study MERRF mutation-related biochemical and molecular events (10Chomyn A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 745-751Google Scholar, 21Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Carte N. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 144-150Google Scholar, 23Helm M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1166-1171Google Scholar). In the absence of transgenic mice and/or access to significant patient biopsy samples, cybrid cell lines represent the only valuable model system to evaluate direct or indirect effects of a human mt tRNA gene mutation at the cellular level and are thus used here for a comparative proteomic approach. A major limitation in establishing mt proteomes resides in the difficulty of organelle purification and thus in the possible presence of lysosomal, peroxisomal, and cytosolic proteins in mt preparations. This is indeed a drawback when searching for the exact exhaustive protein content within a given organelle, a situation different from the aim of the present study. Here the comparative proteomic strategy was applied to highlight proteins undergoing quantitative changes when comparing wild-type and MERRF mitochondria. Due to the large amounts of protein required per analysis and to the low yield of mitochondria from adherent cybrid cell growth, purification of mitochondria was limited to differential centrifugations, so that contaminants on two-dimensional maps were not unexpected. Two-dimensional PAGE of Total Mitochondrial Proteins and Quantitative Aspects—Well resolved silver-stained two-dimensional maps of mt proteins were obtained in a reproducible manner according to procedures established previously (21Rabilloud T. Strub J.M. Carte N. Luche S. Van Dorsselaer A. Lunardi J. Giegé R. Florentz C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 144-150Google Scholar) and allowed detection of about 800 spots (Fig. 1). Quantification was performed on 11 gel couples to allow for a significant analysis by comparison of spot intensities, measured as spot volumes. Normalization of gels (loaded with the same amount of mt proteins), done either according to the total quantity in valid spots or to the total density in gel, leads to the same results and allowed differences linked to experimental procedures (protein loading and staining) to be eliminated so that only significant variations related to the type of sample (wild-type or mutant) were considered. For the same spot, intensity varied on average by 20 – 40% over the different gels of the same type (i.e. within all wild-type or all mutant gels). Accordingly, spot intensity variations greater than these values were sought when comparing normalized wild-type and MERRF-related two-dimensional maps. Change by a factor 2 was chosen as the basis for systematic comparison. The majority of the spots (about 760) did not show significant intensity variations between wild-type and mutant gels. Altogether, 38 spots (4.75% of detectable spots) were found to be affected in intensity, 19 of which decreased and 19 increased. They are located all over the two-dimensional gels, covering small as well as large molecular weight domains and all the pI ranges considered (Fig. 1). Fig. 2, A and B, summarizes quantitative variations of these individual spots as an outcome of the 11 independent experiments. The range of differential spot intensities between wild-type and MERRF mitochondria varied from 2.1- to 9-fold, with most spots affected 2–5-fold. The majority of affected spots had low expression levels, with 27 spots out of 38 with intensities under 700 pixels, the highest intensity reaching 3700 pixels in both types of samples. Spot Assignment—Differentially expressed protein spots as well as a number of non-affected spots were assigned by mass spectrometric (MS) techniques. Identification (in 2–3 independent experiments) was mainly done by MALDI-TOF on colloidal blue-stained gels, based on a minimum of 3 or 4 matching peptides with a peptide mass tolerance of 50 ppm. A typical case is shown in Fig. 3. Nano-LC-MS-MS, an approach leading to the amino acid sequence of a given peptide, was used as a complementary technique in some instances (Fig. 4). For some spots, identification was not successful (lack of signal for spots of low density, recovery of only a few peptides for proteins of low molecular weight, proteins poor in trypsin cleavage sites, low efficiency of peptide extraction from gel, etc.).Fig. 4Representative result of a nano-LC-MS-MS analysis.A, combined spectrum (retention time from 15 to 50 min) of in-gel tryptic digested peptides of spot 22, identified as the mt 28 S ribosomal protein MRP-S22.

https://openalex.org/W2075259916,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a focal adhesion serine/threonine protein kinase with an important role in integrin and growth factor signaling pathways. Recently, we demonstrated that ILK is expressed in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and controls integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth in serum-starved cells grown on laminin (Ishii, T., Satoh, E., and Nishimura, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 42994–43003). Here we report that ILK controls tau phosphorylation via regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) activity in N1E-115 cells. Stable transfection of a kinase-deficient ILK mutant (DN-ILK) resulted in aberrant tau phosphorylation in N1E-115 cells at sites recognized by the Tau-1 antibody that are identical to some of the phosphorylation sites in paired helical filaments, PHF-tau, in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The tau phosphorylation levels in the DN-ILK-expressing cells are constant under normal and differentiating conditions. On the other hand, aberrant tau phosphorylation was not observed in the parental control cells. ILK inactivation resulted in an increase in the active form but a decrease in the inactive form of GSK-3β, which is a candidate kinase involved in PHF-tau formation. Moreover, inhibition of GSK-3β with lithium prevented aberrant tau phosphorylation in the DN-ILK-expressing cells. These results suggest that ILK inactivation results in aberrant tau phosphorylation via sustained activation of GSK-3β in N1E-115 Cells. ILK directly phosphorylates GSK-3β and inhibits its activity. Therefore, endogenous ILK protects against GSK-3β-induced aberrant tau phosphorylation via inhibition of GSK-3β activity in N1E-115 cells.

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules within neurites and axons (1Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that tau hyperphosphorylation leads to the destabilization of microtubules and aggregation of tau proteins, which impairs axonal transport and eventually results in neuronal cell death (1Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Neuroscience. 1997; 78: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 2Goedert M. Spillanti M.G. Davies S.W. Curr. Opin.

Indeed, tau hyperphosphorylation appears to be an early event preceding the formation of paired helical filaments (PHF) 1The abbreviations used are: PHF, paired helical filaments; ILK, integrin-linked kinase; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β; DN, dominant negative; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; FBS, fetal bovine serum. in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients (4Bancher C.

On the other hand, tau phosphorylation also seems to control microtubule dynamics during neurite outgrowth and neuronal maturation, because embryonic and neonatal tau is much more heavily phosphorylated than adult tau (5Bramblett G.T.

Neuroscience. 1996; 72: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, the study of the regulation of tau phosphorylation in neurons is important for understanding the neurofibrillary degeneration in Alzheimer's disease, as well as the physiologic function of tau in neurite outgrowth and neuronal development. Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase protein that serves as a mediator in integrin- and growth factor-mediated signal transduction (9Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Huang Y. Wu C. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 3: 563-572PubMed Google Scholar). ILK is expressed in N1E-115 cells and controls integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study, stable transfection of a kinase-deficient mutant of ILK (DN-ILK), which behaves as a dominant negative and inactivates endogenous ILK, resulted in aberrant tau phosphorylation. DN-ILK overexpression increased the active form and decreased the inactive form of GSK-3β. On the other hand, a selective uncompetitive inhibitor of GSK-3β, lithium, inhibited aberrant tau hyperphosphorylation. These results suggest that inactivation of ILK results in sustained activation of GSK-3β and leads to aberrant tau phosphorylation in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells.

(Osaka, Japan) unless otherwise specified. Construction and Transfection of cDNA Vectors and Cell Culture— Mouse N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT). The kinase-deficient ILK (DN-ILK) was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Glu to Lys) at amino acid residue 359 within the kinase domain of wild type ILK (GenBank™ accession number AF256520) using PCR as described previously (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Wild-type ILK and DN-ILK cDNAs were ligated into the polylinkers in two different mammalian expression vectors, pTracerTM-CMV2 (V885–01; Invitrogen) and pRc-CMV (V750–20; Invitrogen). The DN-ILK cDNA was transfected into N1E-115 cells (5 × 105 cells/100-mm culture dish) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described by Graham and van der Eb (12Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar), and 48 individual Zeocin-resistant cell lines were isolated over the next 4 to 5 weeks. Among them, three different cell lines were selected based on the detection of green fluorescent protein fluorescence and confirmation of gene transcription using reverse transcriptase PCR. The cloned cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% FBS and Zeocin (0.5 mg/ml). ILK Assay—ILK assay was performed as described by Delcommenne et al. (13Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were incubated with anti-ILK antibody (UB 06–592) at 4 °C for 12 h. After incubation, the lysates were precleared, and immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose. After washing twice with lysis buffer and once with 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0) buffer containing 1 mm EDTA, the immunoprecipitated ILK was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μg of the exogenous substrate myelin basic protein in a total volume of 50 μl kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing 6 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi; NEG-502Z; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The kinase reaction products were analyzed using SDS-PAGE (5–20% polyacrylamide) and autoradiography. For detection of the immunoprecipitated ILK and DN-ILK proteins, the precipitated proteins were released from the immunobeads by boiling in 80 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. Equal volumes of the samples were loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Total ILK and DN-ILK proteins were detected by immunoblotting with an anti-ILK antibody (UB 06–550) that recognized both ILK and DN-ILK proteins. GSK-3β—GSK-3β assay was performed essentially as described by Cross (14Cross D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 124: 147-159PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm EDTA, 100 nm okadaic acid, and protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were incubated with anti-GSK-3β antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) at 4 °C for 1 h followed by overnight incubation with protein G-Sepharose. After washing twice with lysis buffer and once with 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, the immunoprecipitated GSK-3β was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 4 μm specific substrate peptide 2B-SP (Ac-RRAAEELDSRAGS(p)PQL) in a total volume of 50 μl kinase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 μCi; NEG-502Z; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction was stopped by placing the samples on ice. After brief centrifugation, 25 μl of the reaction supernatant was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper filters (Whatman, Maidstone, UK), washed with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and rinsed with acetone. The amount of radioactive phosphate incorporated into substrate peptides was determined by scintillation counting. Immunofluorescent Staining—Cells grown on Lab-Tek® chamber slides (Nunc, Tokyo, Japan) were fixed in 1% neutral buffered formaldehyde solution for 10 min and then permeabilized with 0.25% saponin in Hanks' balanced salt solution for 20 min. Permeabilized cells were incubated for 1 h in rabbit anti-phospho(Ser199,Ser202)-Tau antibody (Calbiochem; final dilution 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline). After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were incubated for 1 h in AlexaFluor (R)488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100). Images were obtained by fluorescent microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Antibodies—Anti-Tau (recognizes both native and phosphorylated forms of tau), anti-Tau-1 (recognizes tau dephosphorylated at Ser195, Ser198, Ser199, Ser202, and Thr205 (15Binder L.I. Frankfurter A.

Res. 1993; 34: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar)), and anti-GSK-3β antibody for immunoprecipitation (Transduction Laboratories) were mouse monoclonal antibodies. All the other antibodies, antiphospho (Ser199,Ser202)-Tau (recognizes tau phosphorylated at Ser199 and Ser202), anti-GSK-3β (recognizes both native and phosphorylated forms of GSK-3β), anti-phospho(Ser9)-GSK-3β (Affinity Bioreagents; recognizes GSK-3β phosphorylated at Ser9), anti-phospho(Tyr279/216)-GSK-3α/β (Affinity Bioreagents; recognizes GSK-3α and GSK-3β phosphorylated at Tyr279 and Tyr216, respectively), and anti-ILK (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; UB 06–550 for immunoblotting and UB 06–593 for immunoprecipitation), were rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were solubilized in 100 μl of sample buffer containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) after washing once with phosphate-buffered saline. For detection of ILK expression, cells were solubilized in 5 volumes of buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EGTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The solubilized materials were subjected to SDS-PAGE (5–20% gradient, 6.5 or 10% polyacrylamide) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes at 4 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.025% SDS. After blocking, the blots were probed with appropriate primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, followed by goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The final protein·IgG complexes were visualized following the reaction to 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.

Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated previously (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that ILK is expressed in N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells and controls integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth in serum-starved cells grown on laminin. To inactivate endogenous ILK, cells were stably transfected with DN-ILK, which behaves as a dominant negative (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). Based on the results obtained from immunoblotting (Fig. 1), the expression level of DN-ILK protein in DN-ILK-transfected cells was estimated to be at least twice that of endogenous ILK protein, and neither the ILK nor DN-ILK expression level changed under differentiating conditions. The ILK activity in the parental cells under serum-free conditions was transiently activated after seeding on the laminin matrix, whereas that in the DN-ILK-transfected cells was not. Also, weak basal ILK activity was detected only in the parental cells under non-differentiating conditions (Fig. 1). These findings are consistent with our previous observations (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, DN-ILK inactivates endogenous ILK under both differentiating and non-differentiating conditions. Inactivation of Endogenous ILK Induces Aberrant Tau Phosphorylation—To examine whether tau phosphorylation is involved in neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells, we analyzed the tau phosphorylation level in parental and DN-ILK-transfected cells using phosphorylation- and dephosphorylation-dependent anti-Tau antibodies. Western blots of tau from both parental and DN-ILK-transfected cells were probed with three different tau antibodies, anti-Tau-1, which recognizes an epitope of tau only when it is not phosphorylated, antiphospho (Ser199,Ser202)-Tau, which recognizes tau phosphorylated at Ser199 and Ser202, and anti-Tau, which recognizes both native and phosphorylated forms of tau. In non-transfected parental cells, tau was recognized by anti-Tau-1 but not anti-phospho(Ser199,Ser202)-Tau antibody, under both normal and differentiating conditions. Thus, tau in the parental cells was not phosphorylated at sites recognized by those antibodies in either condition. On the other hand, cells stably transfected with a DN-ILK to inactivate the endogenous ILK had dramatically decreased anti-Tau-1 immunoreactivity but an increased anti-phospho(Ser199,Ser202)-Tau immunoreactivity (Fig. 1). Thus, tau was phosphorylated in DN-ILK-transfected cells, and the tau phosphorylation level did not change even under differentiating conditions. Total tau detected with anti-Tau antibody migrated as several bands in the 40- to 70-kDa range, but some of the protein bands, which migrate relatively slower on SDS-PAGE, were weaker when tau was phosphorylated (Fig. 1). These results suggest that inactivation of endogenous ILK results in aberrant hyperphosphorylation of tau, at least at Ser199 and Ser202. Immunofluorescent Staining of Aberrantly Phosphorylated Tau—To examine the intracellular localization of aberrantly phosphorylated tau, cells were stained with antibody against phosphorylated tau. Immunofluorescent staining of cell mono-layers with anti-phospho(Ser199,Ser202)-Tau antibody is shown in Fig. 2. DN-ILK-transfected cells were strongly stained with the antibody against phosphorylated tau under normal and differentiating conditions. On the other hand, parental cells were not significantly stained under differentiating conditions, but very weak dot-like structures were observed only in the non-differentiated cells, suggesting that a small minority of the tau, which could not be detected by the immunoblotting analysis, might be phosphorylated under non-differentiating conditions. In the DN-ILK-transfected cells, intracellular cytoplasm, except the nucleus, was stained with strong immunofluorescent intensity, and microtubule-like structures were observed. Further analysis of the DN-ILK-transfected cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that microtubule-like structures spread and cover right under the whole plasma membrane of the cells and form basket-like structures (Fig. 2, top, left and right). Active Form of GSK-3β Increases in DN-ILK-transfected Cells—To examine signal pathways involved in tau phosphorylation, we analyzed the activation status of GSK-3β, because GSK-3β is one of the candidate kinases that can phosphorylate tau at both Ser199 and Ser202 (18Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Gong C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and also has an important role in the ILK-mediated signal pathway (13Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 19Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell.

Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Activation of GSK-3β is dependent on Tyr216 phosphorylation (21Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GSK-3β activity is inhibited by direct phosphorylation at Ser9 by ILK (20Persad S. Troussard A.A. McPhee T.R. Mulholland D.J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1161-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 22Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and by protein kinase B/Akt, which is also activated via ILK (13Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 23Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the levels of these phosphorylated GSK-3β forms are different between parental and DN-ILK-transfected cells and are changed under different culture conditions by Western blot analysis using anti-phospho(Ser9)-GSK-3β and anti-phospho-(Tyr279/216)-GSK-3α/β antibodies. Tyr216 in GSK-3β was highly phosphorylated in DN-ILK-transfected cells but was very weakly phosphorylated in parental cells (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Ser9 in GSK-3β was highly phosphorylated in parental cells but not in DN-ILK-transfected cells. Moreover, these phosphorylation levels were not significantly different between non-differentiating and differentiating conditions. The expression level of GSK-3β was not different among all cells tested. These results suggest that ILK inactivation results in Ser9 dephosphorylation and increased Tyr216 phosphorylation in GSK-3β, thereby activating the enzyme. GSK-3β Activity Is Activated by Inactivation of Endogenous ILK in DN-ILK-transfected Cells—To test whether the level of GSK-3β activity increases in DN-ILK-transfected cells, we performed a GSK-3β kinase assay on proteins immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with a monoclonal GSK-3β antibody. The level of GSK-3β activity in DN-ILK-transfected cells was approximately three times more than that in parental cells (Fig. 3B). The level of GSK-3β activity was not different between differentiating and non-differentiating conditions in either DN-ILK-transfected or parental cells (Fig. 3B). Thus, inactivation of endogenous ILK results in increased GSK-3β activity. This result is consistent with the fact that ILK inactivation induced an increase in the levels of active GSK-3β formed via Tyr216 phosphorylation (Fig. 3A). Lithium Reduces Tau Phosphorylation in a Dose-dependent Manner—Lithium is an uncompetitive GSK-3β inhibitor (24Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of lithium on tau phosphorylation. Cells were treated with varying concentrations of LiCl for 16 h under non-differentiating conditions. Treatment of DN-ILK-transfected cells with LiCl reduced anti-phospho(Ser199,Ser202)-Tau immunoreactivity but increased anti-Tau-1 immunoreactivity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Moreover, reaction of slowly migrated tau bands with anti-Tau, which were supposed to be non-phosphorylated tau, was recovered after treatment with LiCl in a dose-dependent manner. The same results were obtained in DN-ILK-transfected cells under differentiating conditions (data not shown). These results suggest that LiCl inhibited tau phosphorylation at Ser199 and Ser202 and also at the sites recognized by anti-Tau-1. On the other hand, the same treatment of parental cells with 25 mm LiCl did not affect either anti-Tau-1 or anti-phospho(Ser199,Ser202)-Tau immunoreactivity. These results suggest that GSK-3β activation induced by ILK inactivation is directly involved in tau phosphorylation at Ser199 and Ser202 and also at the sites recognized by anti-Tau-1. Aberrant Tau Phosphorylation Is Partly Involved in Inhibition of Neurite Outgrowth in DN-ILK-transfected Cells—We demonstrated previously (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase is involved in ILK-mediated signal transduction leading to integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells. In our previous report (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we suggested that signaling pathways other than p38 MAP kinase, which is also activated via ILK activation, might be involved in integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth, because a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, blocked ∼80% of the ILK-dependent neurite outgrowth (see Fig. 5). To examine whether aberrant tau phosphorylation is involved in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth in DN-ILK-transfected cells, we treated the cells with 10 mm LiCl, a dose that prevents aberrant tau phosphorylation, under serum-free conditions. Treatment of the DN-ILK-transfected cells with LiCl partially recovered neurite outgrowth, in the presence or absence of SB203580, to the levels of that in the SB20358-treated parental cells (Fig. 5). On the other hand, treatment of the parental cells with LiCl did not affect neurite outgrowth in either the presence or absence of SB203580 (Fig. 5). These results suggest that aberrant tau phosphorylation is partly involved in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth in DN-ILK-transfected cells. The present study demonstrates that ILK inactivation induces aberrant tau phosphorylation via GSK-3β activation in N1E-115 cells, which is partly involved in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth, based on the following observations: 1) tau was phosphorylated at Ser199 and Ser202 and at the sites recognized by anti-Tau-1 in DN-ILK transfected cells but not in parental cells, 2) ILK inactivation increased the active form but decreased the inactive form of GSK-3β, leading to increased GSK-3β activity, and 3) treatment of the DN-ILK-transfected cells with LiCl, an uncompetitive inhibitor of GSK-3β, blocked aberrant tau phosphorylation and partly recovered the levels of neurite outgrowth in DN-ILK-transfected cells. Integrin signaling is required for neurogenesis in serum-starved N1E-115 cells (25van Leeuwen F.N. Kain H.E.T. van der Kammen R.A. Michiels F. Kranenburg O.W. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 797-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). N1E-115 cells grown on a laminin matrix exhibit neurite outgrowth in response to serum deprivation (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Sarner S. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Lin L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This neurite outgrowth depends on an integrin-dependent signal pathway, because pre-treatment of cells with anti-β1 integrin antibody inhibited neurite outgrowth (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17Sarner S. Kozma R. Ahmed S. Lin L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 158-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that ILK is expressed in N1E-115 cells and controls integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth in serum-starved cells grown on laminin. In the present study, stable transfection of DN-ILK, which behaves as a dominant negative and inactivates endogenous ILK, resulted in aberrant tau phosphorylation. On the other hand, the aberrant tau phosphorylation was not observed in the parental cells under either normal or differentiating conditions. ILK activity in the parental cells was increased after seeding on the laminin matrix under serum-free conditions, whereas that in the DN-ILK-transfected cells was not. Thus, both cell adhesion to laminin and serum deprivation were necessary for full activation of ILK. On the other hand, weak basal ILK activity was detected in the parental cells under non-differentiating normal conditions (Fig. 1). It remains unknown how basal ILK activity is maintained under non-differentiation. These results suggest that endogenous ILK prevents aberrant tau phosphorylation. Moreover, aberrant tau phosphorylation did not significantly occur in the parental cells under normal conditions, suggesting that weak basal ILK activity is sufficient to protect tau from aberrant phosphorylation. To examine whether aberrantly phosphorylated tau participates in microtubule formation, we stained cells with antibody against phosphorylated tau (Fig. 2). Intracellular cytoplasm, except for the nucleus, was stained with strong immunofluorescent intensity, and microtubule-like structures were observed only in DN-ILK-transfected cells. Moreover, analysis of the DN-ILK-transfected cells using confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that microtubule-like structures spread and cover right under the whole plasma membrane of the cells and form basket-like structures (Fig. 2, top, left and right). Thus, aberrantly phosphorylated tau participates in microtubule-like structures but is located only immediately under the plasma membrane in the cytosol without being able to form neurites in DN-ILK-transfected cells. On the other hand, parental control cells under non-differentiating conditions were very weakly stained with antibodies against phosphorylated tau, which could not be detected by the immunoblotting analysis, but neurite-bearing control cells under differentiating conditions were not (Fig. 2, a and c). These results suggest that tau phosphorylation at Ser199 and Ser202 might negatively control microtubule rearrangement necessary for neurite outgrowth via microtubule instability. Tau is phosphorylated at Ser199 and Ser202 and at the sites recognized by anti-Tau-1, which correspond to Ser195, Ser198, Ser199, Ser202, and Thr205. Ser199 and Ser202 are phosphorylated by GSK-3β (18Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Gong C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), which is a candidate kinase involved in PHF-tau formation (26Lovestone S. Reynolds C.H. Latimer D. Davis D.R. Anderton B.H.

Utton M. Gallo J.-M. Miller C.C.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1537-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, GSK-3β has an important role in the ILK-mediated signal pathway (10Huang Y. Wu C. Int. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 3: 563-572PubMed Google Scholar, 19Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the involvement of GSK-3β in aberrant tau phosphorylation in DN-ILK-transfected cells. Activation of GSK-3β is dependent upon the Tyr216 phosphorylation (21Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Plyte S.E. Totty N.F. Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GSK-3β activity is inhibited by direct Ser9 phosphorylation by ILK (19Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 22Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and by protein kinase B/Akt whose activity is also activated via ILK (13Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar, 23Persad S. Attwell S. Gray V. Mawji N. Deng J.T. Leung D. Yan J. Sanghera J. Walsh M.P. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27462-27469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Tyr216 in GSK-3β was highly phosphorylated in DN-ILK-transfected cells but was very weakly phosphorylated in parental cells. In contrast, Ser9 in GSK-3β was highly phosphorylated in parental cells but not in DN-ILK-transfected cells. These phosphorylation levels were not significantly different between non-differentiating and differentiating conditions (Fig. 3A). Thus, GSK-3β was phosphorylated at both Ser9 and Tyr216 in parental cells, whereas Tyr216 phosphorylation was considerably lower (Fig. 3A). Recently, Bhat et al. (28Bhat R.V. Shanley J. Correll M.P. Fieles W.E. Keith R.A. Scott C.W. Lee C.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11074-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) suggested that Ser9 phosphorylation is sufficient to override the Tyr216 phosphorylation-induced activation of GSK-3β. Therefore, the level of GSK-3β activity seems to maintain lower via Ser9 phosphorylation in parental cells. These results suggest that ILK inactivates GSK-3β via phosphorylation at Ser9 and prevents activation. In contrast, ILK inactivation results in Ser9 dephosphorylation and increased Tyr216 phosphorylation in GSK-3β, thereby activating the enzyme. Indeed, the level of GSK-3β activity in DN-ILK-transfected cells was significantly higher than that in parental cells (Fig. 3B). Lithium, a selective uncompetitive inhibitor of GSK-3β (24Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar), inhibited tau phosphorylation at Ser199 and Ser202 and also at the sites recognized by anti-Tau-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). These results suggest that GSK-3β activation induced by ILK inactivation is directly involved in tau phosphorylation at Ser199 and Ser202 and also at the sites recognized by anti-Tau-1. As both Ser199 and Ser202 are phosphorylated by GSK-3β (18Liu F. Iqbal K. Grundke-Iqbal I. Gong C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 530: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), GSK-3β at least directly phosphorylates these Ser residues in the DN-ILK-transfected cells. Although a specific tyrosine kinase, which should be activated by ILK inactivation, is probably involved in the Tyr216 phosphorylation in GSK-3β, we have not yet determined the kinase involved in this study. To understand the ILK-mediated regulatory mechanisms of GSK-3β, the specific tyrosine kinase that is activated by ILK inactivation and phosphorylates Tyr216 in GSK-3β must be determined. We demonstrated previously (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that p38 MAP kinase in the ILK-mediated signal pathway has an important role in integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells. On the other hand, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, SB203580, blocked ∼80% of the ILK-dependent neurite outgrowth but not to the levels of the DN-ILK-transfected cells (see Fig. 5). In the previous study (11Ishii T. Satoh E. Nishimura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42994-43003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we suggested that signaling pathways other than p38 MAP kinase, which are also activated via ILK activation, are involved in integrin-dependent neurite outgrowth. We therefore examined whether aberrant tau phosphorylation is involved in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth in DN-ILK-transfected cells. Treatment of the DN-ILK-transfected cells with 10 mm LiCl completely prevented aberrant tau phosphorylation but only partially recovered neurite outgrowth to the levels of that in the SB20358-treated parental cells. These results suggest that aberrant tau phosphorylation is partly involved in the inhibition of neurite outgrowth in DN-ILK-transfected cells. Furthermore, the results also suggest that a p38 MAP kinase pathway is the sole downstream pathway in ILK-dependent neurite outgrowth. Tau hyperphosphorylation decreases the association of tau with microtubules (29Hong M. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19547-19553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) and inhibits total neurite number (30Cressman C.M. Shea T.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 1995; 42: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Malchiodi-Albedi F. Petrucci T.C. Picconi B. Iosi F. Falchi M. J. Neurosci.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37046-37052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of aberrant tau phosphorylation on neurite outgrowth was as expected. The effect of aberrant tau phosphorylation, however, is considered to depend on the tau phosphorylation level and also on the number of phosphorylated tau molecules. Although we could not estimate how many molecules in total tau are phosphorylated in the DN-ILK-transfected cells in this study, it is possible that the aberrant tau phosphorylation induced by ILK inactivation at least affects microtubule stability or dynamics and leads to inhibition of neurite outgrowth. On the other hand, endogenous ILK protects tau from aberrant phosphorylation and probably maintains a kind of equilibrium status responsible for microtubule reorganization. Thus, ILK is not only involved in p38 MAP kinase activation but might also control microtubule dynamics via regulation of GSK-3β activity during neurite outgrowth in N1E-115 cells (Fig. 6). A recent study (33Mills J. Digicaylioglu M. Legg A.T. Young C.E. Young S.S. Barr A.M. Fletcher L. O'Connor T.P. Dedhar S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1638-1648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth using pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells demonstrated that ILK is involved in nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth via inhibition of tau hyperphosphorylation. This recent report using PC12 cells and our results obtained using N1E-115 cells suggest that ILK is an important regulator of both integrin- and growth factor-mediated signaling in neurons and controls neurite outgrowth. Moreover, ILK might be critical for the regulation of microtubule stability and rearrangement necessary for integrin- and growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth. We thank Dr. M. Niinobe (Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, Japan) for providing the N1E-115 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2113348899,"The in vitro activity of the channel-forming bacteriocins such as colicin E1 in model membranes requires the specific activation of the protein by an acidic environment in the presence of a membrane potential. Acid activation of the C-terminal domain results in the formation of an insertion-competent intermediate with an enhanced ability to penetrate and perforate cell membranes. We report novel findings of this activation process through the design and study of mutant proteins involving the replacement of conserved Asp residues Asp-408, Asp-410, and Asp-423 within helices 5a and 4 in the colicin E1 channel domain that resulted in enhanced membrane binding, bilayer insertion rates, and ion channel activities at near neutral pH values. This activation process involves the destabilization of a critical salt bridge (Asp-410 and Lys-406) and H-bonds (Asp-408 and Ser-405 main chain; Asp-423 and Lys-420 main chain). The helix-to-coil transition of this motif was identified previously by time-resolved Trp fluorescence measurements (Merrill, A. R., Steer, B. A., Prentice, G. A., Weller, M. J., and Szabo, A. G.

Finally, we show that the essential components of the pH trigger motif are conserved among the channel-forming colicins and that it likely exists within other bacterial proteins and may even have evolved into more sophisticated devices in a number of microbial species. The colicins are a family of antimicrobial proteins that are secreted by Escherichia coli strains under environmental stress, due to nutrient depletion or overcrowding, and these proteins often target-sensitive bacterial strains (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Sci. 1984; 1: 203-205Google Scholar). The lethal action of colicins against their target cells is manifested in a number of different modes that include the following: (i) formation of depolarizing ion channels in the cytoplasmic membrane, (ii) inhibition of protein and peptidoglycan synthesis, and (iii) degradation of cellular nucleic acids (1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Sci. 1984; 1: 203-205Google Scholar, 2Cramer W.A. Dankert J.R. Uratani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 737: 173-193Google Scholar, 3Pugsley A.P. Microbiol.

Struct. 1995; 24: 611-641Google Scholar, 5Riley M.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 255-278Google Scholar, 6Stroud R.M. Reiling K. Wiener M. Freymann D. Curr. Opin. Struct.

In this context, the bacterial machinery responsible for colicin biological activity features important mechanisms that are fundamental to various biological processes. These mechanisms include protein receptor binding, membrane translocation, membrane binding and protein unfolding, membrane insertion, voltage-gated ion channel formation, catalysis, and inhibition of enzymes.Colicin E1 is a member of the channel-forming subfamily of colicins and is secreted by E. coli that possesses the naturally occurring colE1 plasmid; the holoprotein consists of three functional segments, the translocation, receptor-binding, and channel-forming domains. Initially, the receptor-binding domain (8Brunden K.R. Cramer W.A. Cohen F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 190-196Google Scholar) interacts with the vitamin B12 receptor of target cells. Following recognition, the translocation domain associates with the tolA gene product, which permits the translocation of colicin E1 across the outer membrane and into the periplasm (9Dankert J.R. Uratani Y. Grabau C. Cramer W.A. Hermodson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3857-3863Google Scholar). In the periplasm, the channel domain undergoes a conformational change to an insertion-competent state and then inserts spontaneously into the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell, forming an ion channel. The channel allows the passage of monovalent ions, resulting in the dissipation of the cationic gradients (H+, K+, and Na+) of the target cell, causing depolarization of the cytoplasmic membrane. In an effort to compensate for the membrane depolarization effected by the colicin E1 channel, Na+/K+-ATPase activity is increased in the host cell, resulting in the consumption of ATP reserves, without concomitant replenishment (4Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B. Schendel S.L. Deriy B.N. Cohen F.S. Elkins P.A. Stauffacher C.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 611-641Google Scholar). The final outcome is host cell death.In addition to structural similarities between colicin E1 and several membrane-targeting proteins, an intriguing characteristic shared by colicin E1 and many membrane-active proteins is the observed requirement of an acidic environment for activation of the soluble structure in order to bind and insert into target cell membranes. The important effect of an acidic environment in conferring an optimum activity in vitro, and perhaps in vivo, for colicin E1 has been attributed to an onset of acid-induced protein unfolding events, resulting in an increased structural mobility/flexibility that may potentiate the complex sequence of structural changes of the channel peptide observed at the surface of a membrane (10Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8529-8534Google Scholar, 11Schendel S.L. Cramer W.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2272-2279Google Scholar, 12Lindeberg M. Zakharov S.D. Cramer W.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 679-692Google Scholar).An important contribution to our understanding of the mechanism of colicin E1 low pH activation was conducted by Merrill et al. (13Merrill A.R. Steer B.A. Prentice G.A. Weller M.J. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6874-6884Google Scholar) in which a precise pH-sensitive region within the soluble channel domain was identified. By using solution steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements of single Trp mutant channel peptides, Merrill et al. (13Merrill A.R. Steer B.A. Prentice G.A. Weller M.J. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6874-6884Google Scholar) demonstrated that only two of the nine Trp residues engineered at different sites throughout the protein, Trp-413 and Trp-424, exhibited pH-sensitive fluorescence parameters. The fluorescence quantum yield and the lifetime decay components of Trp-413 and Trp-424 exhibited significant pH-sensitive changes that indicated an altered Trp chemical environment as a consequence of site-specific structural changes induced within the channel domain upon acidification.These observations led to the proposal that the peptide segment encompassing residues 413 and 424 (helices 4 and 5a) within the colicin E1 channel domain undergoes a helix-to-coil transition during solution acidification. This low pH-induced unraveling of helices 4 and 5a was proposed to result from the disruption of a critical salt bridge and three hydrogen bonds that stabilize the secondary structure of this segment of the protein (6Stroud R.M. Reiling K. Wiener M. Freymann D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 525-533Google Scholar, 13Merrill A.R. Steer B.A. Prentice G.A. Weller M.J. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6874-6884Google Scholar). The disruption of one or all of these H-bond links may provide the initial driving force for a cascade of structural events within the channel peptide that lead to the activated, membrane-competent state of the protein.In the present work, we report the preparation of single and double Asp-to-Ser mutations localized to helices 4 and 5a of the colicin E1 channel domain, which is believed to be the heart of the pH trigger motif (13Merrill A.R. Steer B.A. Prentice G.A. Weller M.J. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6874-6884Google Scholar). Our findings show that Asp-to-Ser mutations disrupt critical H-bonds within the trigger motif and induce a helix-to-coil transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effect of these mutations on the activation mechanism (function) of the channel domain by measuring channel domain binding to synthetic membrane vesicles, membrane bilayer insertion rates, and ion channel activity. Finally, we probe and characterize the helix-to-coil transition with steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation and Purification of Colicin E1 Channel Peptides—Colicin E1 wild-type (WT) 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild-type; DTT, dithiothreitol; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DOPG, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; GdmHCl, guanidinium hydrochloride; LUVs, large unilamellar vesicles; MIANS, 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; SPQ, 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfonopropyl)quinolinium; TNP-PE, N-(trinitrophenyl)phosphatidylethanolamine. and mutant proteins were prepared and purified as described previously (14Tory M.C. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24539-24549Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined for the channel peptides using molar extinction coefficients as determined earlier (15Merrill A.R. Palmer L.R. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6974-6981Google Scholar, 16Tory M.C. Merrill A.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1564: 435-448Google Scholar).Cytotoxicity Assay of Colicin E1—The cytotoxic activity of WT colicin E1 and mutant proteins was confirmed through a “spot test” technique using E. coli strain B cells as described previously (17Song H.Y. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2927-2934Google Scholar, 18Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Google Scholar). In brief, 5-μl aliquots of serially diluted intact WT or mutant colicin E1 protein samples were applied onto a log phase bacterial lawn of colicin-sensitive E. coli, strain B. Cells were then allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C, and cytotoxic activity was monitored as the clearance of the lawn of sensitive strain B cells. The concentrations of the mutant and the WT proteins, at which clearing zones were observed, were compared as a quantitative measure of the cytotoxicity of each mutant protein relative to WT.Preparation of Vesicles—LUVs were prepared from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phosphorac-(1-glycerol)] (DOPG) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and N-(trinitrophenyl)phosphatidylethanolamine (TNP-PE) (Sigma, discontinued) in 60:30:10% molar ratio by extrusion through a 100-nm polycarbonate filter (Lipofast, Aventin Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) in 20 mm DMG, 130 mm NaCl at pH 3.5–5.0 as described earlier (14Tory M.C. Merrill A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24539-24549Google Scholar, 19Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles were prepared from DOPG and 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(9,10)dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) in a 2:3 molar ratio by sonication in an ultrasonic water bath followed by sequential extrusion through a 100- and 50-nm polycarbonate filter (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) as described earlier (19Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Google Scholar, 20Zakharov S.D. Lindeberg M. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11325-11332Google Scholar). The suspension buffer used was 20 mm DMG, 130 mm NaCl, at pH 5.Asolectin (Sigma) LUVs (∼20 mg/ml) were loaded with the Cl–-sensitive fluorophore, 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfonopropyl) quinolinium (SPQ, 16 mm) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and were prepared according to the freeze-thaw technique as described previously (21Shiver J.W. Cohen F.S. Merrill A.R. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8421-8428Google Scholar, 22Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1108-1115Google Scholar), and the encapsulation buffer was 100 m KCl, 10 mm DMG, 1 mm CaCl2, 16 mm SPQ at pH 5.0. The phospholipid concentration was determined using the Bartlett assay for phosphorus as described by New (23New R.R.C. New R.R.C. Liposomes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1990: 105-160Google Scholar).Membrane Binding Assay—The binding of WT and mutant colicin E1 channel peptides to membrane vesicles was assayed through the quenching of Trp fluorescence by TNP-PE vesicles, as previously described (24Heymann J.B. Zakharov S.D. Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2717-2725Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were obtained with a PTI Alphascan-2 spectrofluorometer (Photon Technologies International, South Brunswick, NJ) equipped with thermostated cell holders and magnetic stirring. Titration data were recorded at 25 °C, with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 293 and 340 nm, respectively. The spectral bandwidths for the excitation and emission wavelengths were set as 4 and 8 nm, respectively. The fluorescence signals were integrated over a 30-s time window in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Vesicle light scattering was minimized using a 309 nm cut-off filter (Oriel Corporation, Rockford, IL) placed in the emission light path; further light scattering contributions to the signal were measured from the buffer titrations of LUVs under the same conditions as described for the protein-lipid titrations.Measurement of Membrane Insertion Kinetics—The vesicle insertion kinetics for channel proteins were measured by the decrease in the Trp fluorescence of the samples caused by the quenching of the brominated phospholipid (bromine at Cys-9, 10-acyl position) as described earlier (20Zakharov S.D. Lindeberg M. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11325-11332Google Scholar). The final protein and lipid concentrations used were 0.25 and 125 μm (2:3 (mol/mol) 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(9,10)dibromo-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/DOPG)), respectively, in 20 mm DMG, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.In Vitro Assay of Channel Activity—Voltage-independent chloride efflux from SPQ-loaded vesicles was measured as described by Illsley and Verkman (25Illsley N.P. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1215-1219Google Scholar). Dye-loaded vesicles were diluted to 0.3 mg/ml in 20 mm DMG, 100 mm NaNO3 buffer, at the desired pH. The vesicle fluorescence was monitored continuously for 2 min at 20 °C with constant stirring after which protein was added (2 ng/ml, final conc.). Fluorescence measurements were taken using excitation and emission wavelengths of 347 and 445 nm, respectively. The spectral bandwidth for both wavelengths was set to 5 nm. The extravesicular buffer was 100 mm NaNO3, 10 mm DMG, pH 6.0, and the encapsulation buffer was 100 mm KCl, 10 mm DMG, 1 mm CaCl2, at pH 5.0. The total amount of encapsulated Cl– was released by the addition of Triton X-100 (0.1%, final concentration) to the sample. The fluorescence changes upon the addition of the protein were reported as the percent maximum SPQ fluorescence (%Fmax); %Fmax(t) = ((F – Fb)/(FT – Fb)) × 100%, where Fb is the initial residual fluorescence of the dye-loaded vesicles and FT is the maximal fluorescence intensity after detergent lysis of the vesicles. All fluorescence measurements were performed using an Eclipse spectrofluorometer equipped with magnetic stirrer and Peltier thermostated multicell holder (Varian Instruments, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).Quantification of Disulfide Bonds within Colicin E1—In order to test whether the introduced cysteine residues in the A407C/A411C mutant channel peptide had formed a disulfide bond, the thiol-specific free dye, 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS) was used as a probe for the quantification of the free thiol content of A407C/A411C. First, evidence for disulfide bond formation between Cys-407 and Cys-411 was assayed by spectrophotometrically monitoring the conjugation reaction between free protein sulfhydryl side chains and MIANS. Sample proteins (4 μm) in 100 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, were reacted with excess MIANS (20 μm) in the absence or presence of a partially denaturing 4 m guanidinium hydrochloride (GdmHCl) solution. The dye/protein reaction mixtures were incubated in the dark and under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 h. As a control, an equal molar WT channel peptide sample was also reacted with excess MIANS, with or without GdmHCl as described above.Fluorescence measurements of the protein/dye reaction mixtures were obtained at 25 °C using the PTI spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was set to 322 nm, and emission spectra were scanned from 350 to 550 nm. Both the excitation and emission spectral wavelength bandwidths were set to 4 nm, and the fluorescence spectra were corrected for the appropriate buffer-containing controls.The number of free sulfhydryl groups of A407C/A411C, under non-denaturing, reducing, and/or partially denaturing conditions was further quantified from the stoichiometry of the MIANS labeling reaction. In brief, the labeling reactions were performed as follows. Purified A407C/A411C in pH 7.5 PBS solutions were treated with a 10-fold molar excess of MIANS for1hinthe dark under a nitrogen atmosphere. 5-Fold molar excess of Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce) and 4 m GdmHCl were used to reduce and then to partially denature the protein, respectively. Unreacted MIANS were separated from the conjugated protein sample using 10-kDa (molecular weight cut-off) Microcon™ concentrators (Amicon, MA), and the concentrated sample was further washed four times with pH 7.5 PBS buffer. The stoichiometry of the protein-MIANS conjugation reaction was calculated as the molar ratio of conjugated MIANS and labeled proteins. The molar concentration of the conjugated MIANS and protein were determined from the absorbance at 322 and 280 nm of the labeled protein using the molar extinction coefficients of 20,877.2 and 28,710 m–1 cm–1, respectively.RESULTSBinding of Channel Peptides to LUVs—In an earlier report (13Merrill A.R. Steer B.A. Prentice G.A. Weller M.J. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6874-6884Google Scholar), we identified a small helix-turn-helix motif (the transition from a helix to a coil activates the protein) as the peptide machinery (pH trigger motif) responsible for the pH-activation mechanism of the channel domain in colicin E1. Fig. 1A shows the details of the trigger motif, which features a salt bridge and two critical and pH-sensitive H-bonds formed by the ionizable side chains of residues Asp-408, Asp-410, and Asp-423 (13Merrill A.R. Steer B.A. Prentice G.A. Weller M.J. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6874-6884Google Scholar). In order to test this proposed mechanism, we prepared single and double Asp replacement mutants of the channel domain targeting the fully or partially conserved Asp residues within the family of channel-forming colicins (Fig. 1B, boldface text indicated by arrows). Importantly, these mutant proteins were found to possess similar cytotoxic activity as compared with the WT protein as determined from a spot test assay on a lawn of colicin-sensitive cells as described previously (Refs. 17Song H.Y. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2927-2934Google Scholar and 18Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Google Scholar; data not shown). Furthermore, the structural integrity of the mutant proteins was assessed and was found to be similar to the WT channel domain by circular dichroism spectroscopy, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, and GdmHCl denaturation assays as described earlier (Refs. 15Merrill A.R. Palmer L.R. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6974-6981Google Scholar and 18Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Google Scholar; data not shown). It was hypothesized from previous work (13Merrill A.R. Steer B.A. Prentice G.A. Weller M.J. Szabo A.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6874-6884Google Scholar) that these Asp-to-Ser mutant proteins would be defective in their ability to form H-bonds within helices 4 and 5a, causing destabilization of this helical region resulting in a shift that favors the coil species in the helix-to-coil transition equilibrium and thus would be expected to show membrane binding activity at neutral pH values.The pH-dependent binding of WT and “trigger” mutant channel peptides to fluorescently tagged and anionic large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) was determined according to the method of Heymann et al. (24Heymann J.B. Zakharov S.D. Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2717-2725Google Scholar). This assay exploits the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the Trp residues of the protein to trinitrophenyl (TNP) conjugated to the lipid head group of phosphatidylethanolamine within the membrane (TNP-PE). TNP is an excellent FRET acceptor for excited Trp (donor), having an absorbance spectrum with a maximum at 339 nm, which substantially overlaps the Trp emission spectrum within the range of 320 –340 nm (24Heymann J.B. Zakharov S.D. Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2717-2725Google Scholar). The 50% donor-acceptor FRET efficiency distance (Förster distance, R0) for Trp-TNP pairs were reported to be 24 (26Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy, Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 445Google Scholar) and 27 Å, 2A. Szabo and J. Brennan, unpublished data. the latter corresponds to the Förster distance specific for colicin E1 Trp FRET to TNP-PE. At a 10% molar ratio TNP-PE lipid concentration within the LUVs, the association of WT colicin E1 with the membrane surface resulted in the quenching of the Trp donor fluorescence of the colicin E1 channel peptide to greater than 95% of the total initial fluorescence (data not shown). This observation was in agreement with earlier findings of Heymann et al. (24Heymann J.B. Zakharov S.D. Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2717-2725Google Scholar) and indicates that at 10% molar ratio concentration in the membrane, the distribution of TNP-PE provides satisfactory coverage of the membrane surface to allow a complete assay of the protein interactions with the membrane.The pH-dependent membrane-binding profiles of WT and some of the mutant channel peptides prepared for this study are shown in Fig. 2, a–d. For the WT colicin E1 channel peptide ([P] = 0.25 μm), the mean values of the binding parameters, Kd and n, at pH 4.0 (Fig. 2, a–d) were determined to be 1.5 ± 0.7 nm and 97 ± 2 (mol/mol), respectively, giving an equilibrium association constant (Ka) value of 8.8 ± 2.1 μm–1, which is in good agreement with the Ka value reported earlier by Heymann et al. (24Heymann J.B. Zakharov S.D. Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2717-2725Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of WT colicin E1 shows a strong, cooperative pH dependence for membrane binding with a pKa for association near 4.1 (WT, Fig. 2, a–d, diamonds), which agrees well with previous reports (11Schendel S.L. Cramer W.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2272-2279Google Scholar, 27Merrill A.R. Cohen F.S. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5829-5836Google Scholar, 28Evans L.J. Goble M.L. Hales K.A. Lakey J.H.

Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Google Scholar). In contrast to the WT protein, the binding isotherms of the double Asp-to-Ser-substituted and disulfide-bonded mutant channel peptides exhibited altered binding profiles with an alkaline-directed shift in pH-dependence (Fig. 2, a–d). The single Asp-to-Ser-substituted mutant proteins showed smaller shifts in their pH-dependent binding profiles (data not shown), indicating that the concerted action of multiple acidic residues within the trigger motif is responsible for the pH-activation of colicin E1. The effect on the pH-binding profile for single Asp replacement mutant proteins was evident but marginal (data not shown); however, double replacement mutants, D408S/D423S, D408S/D410S, and D410S/D423S, showed the predicted alkaline pH-shift in their membrane-binding profiles with pKa values between 4.5 and 4.6 (Fig. 2, a–c).Fig. 2Comparison of the pH-dependent membrane binding profiles of WT and mutant colicin E1 proteins. Association equilibrium constants (Ka) determined from the binding parameters, Kd and n, as described by Heymann et al. (24Heymann J.B. Zakharov S.D. Zhang Y.L. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2717-2725Google Scholar) are shown. The WT profile is shown in each a– d (diamonds). a, D408S/D423S (circles); b, D408S/D410S (triangles); c, D410S/D423S (asterisks); d, A407C/A411C (squares). For all traces, the protein concentration was 0.25 μm, and the molar lipid ratio was 60:30:10 (mol/mol/mol), DOPC/DOPG/TNP-PE. The error bars shown correspond to the standard deviations of at least two independent experiments each of which consisted of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Characterization of A407C/A411C Disulfide-bonded Mutant—The double Cys replacement mutant protein consisting of Ala residues 407 and 411 being substituted with Cys within helix 4 exhibited a similar alkaline pH-shift in membrane binding activity (Fig. 2d). The binding parameters for the A407C/A411C mutant channel peptide in the presence of reducing agents (5 mm DTT, data not shown) did not significantly differ from those observed for the oxidized state (Ka = 1.7 ± 0.3 and 1.4 ± 0.2 μm–1 in the absence and presence of DTT, respectively, at pH 4.5; Fig. 2d). The formation of a disulfide bond between Cys-407 and Cys-411 in A407C/A411C was confirmed for the conjugation reaction with the thiol-specific fluorescent probe MIANS, which was used to titrate the free sulfhydryl side chains in this mutant channel peptide. Fig. 3 shows the normalized fluorescence spectra of MIANS with the WT and the A407C/A411C mutant channel peptide under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions. Incubation of excess MIANS with the WT channel peptide (the WT possesses 1 buried Cys residue, Cys-505) under non-denaturing conditions resulted in negligible MIAN conjugation, showing little MIANS fluorescence (Fig. 3, trace 1). Partial unfolding of the WT colicin E1 peptide with 4 m GdmHCl and exposure of Cys-505 led to a substantial increase in MIANS fluorescence (Fig. 3, trace 2). In comparison, incubation of excess MIANS with the A407C/A411C mutant channel peptide under non-denaturing conditions resulted in only nominal MIANS-protein conjugation (Fig. 3, trace 3). This resistance to conjugation with MIANS indicated that the two surface-exposed Cys residues in A407C/A411C were predominantly involved in a disulfide bond. Furthermore, partial unfolding of A407C/A411C with 4 m GdmHCl enhanced the MIANS labeling to a similar extent as seen for the WT protein (Fig. 3, trace 4), indicating that only the sulfhydryl side chain of Cys-405 was free to react with the label in the disulfide mutant protein (MIANS/protein molar stoichiometry of 1:1). Additionally, pre-incubation of the A407C/A411C mutant protein under reducing and non-denaturing conditions prior to MIANS labeling yielded a conjugation stoichiometry of 2.1:1 (mol/mol, MIANS/protein) as expected. Moreover, under reducing and partially denaturing conditions, the stoichiometry of the MIANS-protein conjugation reaction was 3.2:1 (mol/mol, MIANS/protein), again as expected (data not shown). In summary, these observations verify that the cysteine residues as engineered into the channel peptide were components of a cystine bond within the A407C/A411C mutant protein.Fig. 3Normalized MIANS fluorescence emission spectrum of the MIANS-channel peptide adducts formed from the conjugation reaction of excess MIANS and equimolar quantities of WT and A407C/A411C channel peptides. Spectra of the conjugation reaction of MIANS and WT channel peptide (native, trace 1; partially denatured, trace 2) as well as MIANS and A407C/A411C channel peptide (native, trace 3, partially denatured, trace 4) are shown.

https://openalex.org/W1973951124,"The phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus thuringiensis can be activated by nonsubstrate interfaces such as phosphatidylcholine micelles or bilayers. This activation corresponds with partial insertion into the interface of two tryptophans, Trp-47 in helix B and Trp-242 in a loop, in the rim of the αβ-barrel. Both W47A and W242A have much weaker binding to interfaces and considerably lower kinetic interfacial activation. Tryptophan rescue mutagenesis, reinsertion of a tryptophan at a different place in helix B in the W47A mutant or in the loop (residues 232–244) of the W242A mutant, has been used to determine the importance and orientation of a tryptophan in these two structural features. Phosphotransferase and phosphodiesterase assays, and binding to phosphatidylcholine vesicles were used to assess both orientation and position of tryptophans needed for interfacial activity. Of the helix B double mutants, only one mutant, I43W/W47A, has tryptophan in the same orientation as Trp-47. I43W/W47A shows recovery of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PC) activation of d-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate hydrolysis. However, the specific activity toward phosphatidylinositol is still lower than wild type enzyme and high activity with phosphatidylinositol solubilized in 30% isopropyl alcohol (a hallmark of the native enzyme) is lost. Reinserting a tryptophan at several positions in the loop composed of residues 232–244 partially recovers PC activation and affinity of the enzyme for lipid interfaces as well as activation by isopropyl alcohol. G238W/W242A shows an enhanced activation and affinity for PC interfaces above that of wild type. These results provide constraints on how this bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C binds to activating PC interfaces. The phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus thuringiensis can be activated by nonsubstrate interfaces such as phosphatidylcholine micelles or bilayers. This activation corresponds with partial insertion into the interface of two tryptophans, Trp-47 in helix B and Trp-242 in a loop, in the rim of the αβ-barrel. Both W47A and W242A have much weaker binding to interfaces and considerably lower kinetic interfacial activation. Tryptophan rescue mutagenesis, reinsertion of a tryptophan at a different place in helix B in the W47A mutant or in the loop (residues 232–244) of the W242A mutant, has been used to determine the importance and orientation of a tryptophan in these two structural features. Phosphotransferase and phosphodiesterase assays, and binding to phosphatidylcholine vesicles were used to assess both orientation and position of tryptophans needed for interfacial activity. Of the helix B double mutants, only one mutant, I43W/W47A, has tryptophan in the same orientation as Trp-47. I43W/W47A shows recovery of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PC) activation of d-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate hydrolysis. However, the specific activity toward phosphatidylinositol is still lower than wild type enzyme and high activity with phosphatidylinositol solubilized in 30% isopropyl alcohol (a hallmark of the native enzyme) is lost. Reinserting a tryptophan at several positions in the loop composed of residues 232–244 partially recovers PC activation and affinity of the enzyme for lipid interfaces as well as activation by isopropyl alcohol. G238W/W242A shows an enhanced activation and affinity for PC interfaces above that of wild type. These results provide constraints on how this bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C binds to activating PC interfaces.

Bacterial PI-PLC enzymes, which are secreted by the bacterium, have a simpler structure than the complex multidomain mammalian enzymes. Whereas bacterial PI-PLC enzymes do not have a role in signaling in the bacterium, they can be critical for infection of other cells (3Wadsworth S.J. Goldfine H. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 4650-4660Google Scholar). The PI-PLC enzymes from Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes are composed of a distorted (βα)6 barrel that is structurally very similar to the catalytic domain of PLCδ1 (4Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Google Scholar, 5Essen L.O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 581-583Google Scholar, 6Heinz D.W. Essen L O.

Interfacial binding of both bacterial and mammalian enzymes to phospholipid interfaces, which was shown to be linked to the kinetic activity of PI-PLC in both steps in the reaction (8Lewis K.A. Garigapati V.R. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8836-8841Google Scholar, 9Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Google Scholar, 10Hendrickson H.S. Hendrickson E.K.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11650-11659Google Scholar), was suggested to involve parts of the rim of the barrel. A good candidate for the interfacial binding site is provided by an unusual clustering of hydrophobic residues (and relative lack of charged residues) in the rim of the bacterial enzyme as well as in a ridge at the top of the barrel of PLCδ1 (15Ellis M.V. James S.R. Perisic O. Downes C.P. Williams R.L. Katan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11650-11659Google Scholar). The simpler structure of the bacterial enzyme makes it an excellent system for exploring the importance of hydrophobic rim residues for both interfacial binding and catalytic activity. Previously, we showed that two tryptophan residues, Trp-47 in helix B and Trp-242 in Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC) in a 13-member loop (232FTSLSSGGTAWNS244), play major roles in binding to PC surfaces and interfacial activation by that nonsubstrate phospholipid (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). The large hydrophobic side chain of tryptophan has the largest free energy for partitioning into PC membranes as measured by the Wimley and White hydrophobicity scale (17Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Google Scholar), and mutants that replace these bulky groups are predicted to have dramatically reduced affinities for surfaces. This was observed for W47A and W242A mutants binding to PC interfaces (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). In the present work, we have investigated the effects of orientation and position of tryptophan residues in helix B and the 232–244 loop on PI-PLC activity. If other factors as well as membrane insertion affect binding and interfacial activation of PI-PLC, replacement of different residues in the rim could alter PI-PLC kinetics and membrane binding. With this in mind, we prepared the following mutant PI-PLCs:doublemutants, I43W/W47A, Q45W/W47A, G48W/W47A, M49W/W47A, S236W/W242A, G238W/W242A, and N243W/W242A, as well as a mutant with three tryptophan residues in the rim, G238W. These were characterized for kinetic activation of PI and cIP hydrolysis by diC7PC (9Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Google Scholar, 13Qian X. Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6513-6522Google Scholar, 16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar) and the water-miscible organic solvent isopropyl alcohol (18Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8514-8521Google Scholar, 19Wehbi H. Feng J. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar), the ability to bind to PC interfaces (comparing both intrinsic fluorescence in the presence of PC micelles and a vesicle filtration assay), 2H. Wehbi, J. Feng, J. Kohlbeck, B. Ananthanarayanan, W. Cho, and M. F. Roberts, submitted for publication. and any changes in secondary structure (analyzed by CD spectroscopy). Results indicate that the orientation of the tryptophan in helix B is very critical for interfacial binding and kinetic activation by both PC and iPrOH. There are fewer constraints on the position of tryptophan in the rim loop. In fact, replacing Gly-238 with tryptophan in W242A improves the vesicle binding ability of PI-PLC and enhances cleavage of PI solubilized in diC7PC above that of native PI-PLC. Having three tryptophans in the rim does not dramatically enhance vesicle binding or the enzyme-specific activity indicating that only two tryptophans (one in helix B and another in the 232–244 loop) are inserting into PC membranes. The ability to uncouple PC activation from water-miscible solvent activation of the enzyme for many of these mutants strongly suggests that the two methods of activation occur by different pathways. Chemicals—POPC, diC6PC, diC7PC, and PI were purchased from Avanti; crude PI for preparing cIP was purchased from Sigma. cIP was prepared from PI as described previously (9Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Google Scholar). myo-Inositol, Triton X-100, and iPrOH was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent-grade. Overexpression of Bacterial PI-PLC and Construction of Mutants—A plasmid containing the Bacillus thuringiensis PI-PLC gene obtained from Dr. Ming-Daw Tsai (Ohio State University) was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells (BL21-Codonplus (DE3)-RIL from Stratagene). Overexpression and purification of the recombinant protein and tryptophan mutants W47A and W242A have been described previously (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). Protein solutions were concentrated using Millipore Centraplus 10 filters; concentrations were estimated by both A280 (and the calculated extinction coefficient) and by Lowry assays. All of the mutations of the PI-PLC gene were carried out by QuikChange methodology (21Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Google Scholar, 22Zhong L. Johnson W.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2121-2128Google Scholar) using a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Two complementary mutagenic primers (all purchased from Operon) purified by high pressure liquid chromatography and containing the desired mutation were annealed to the same sequence on opposite strands of the plasmid. The primer CAAGCTTGTCTTCTTGGGGTACAGCAGCG and its complement were used for construction of G238W using the WT PI-PLC gene. Construction of the double mutants started with W47A or W242A single mutants (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). The primers for I43W, Q45W, G48W, and M49W introduction into W47A were CAAGTTGCAAAATCCGTGGAAGCAAGTGGCGGG, GCAAAATCCGATTAAGTGGGTGGCGGGAATGACG, GCAAGTGGCGGGATGGACGCAAGAATATG, and GATTAAGCAAGTGGCGTGGATGACGCAAGAATATG and the complement to each. The primers for N243W, G238W, and S236W were GGTGGTACAGCAGCGTGGAGTCCATATTACTACG, CAAGCTTGTCTTCTTGGGGTACAGCAGCG, and CTATATATTAATTTTACAAGCTTGTGGTCTGGTGGTACAGCAGCG (along with each complement). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing carried out by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Sequencing facility. CD Spectroscopy—WT and mutant PI-PLC secondary structure and thermal stability as monitored by the thermal denaturation transition (Tm) were measured using an AVIV 202 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermoelectric sample temperature controller. For Tm measurements, the ellipticity at 222 nm of protein samples (0.03–0.04 mg/ml in 10 mm borate buffer in a 1-cm cell) was monitored as the temperature was increased from 25 to 80 °C in 1 °C steps with an equilibration time of 1 or 2 min. Comparison of secondary structure for WT and mutant PI-PLC used wavelength scans from 300 to 195 nm with protein (0.2–0.3 mg/ml) in a 0.1-cm cell at 25 °C. Secondary structure content was estimated with CDNN (23Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Google Scholar, 24Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Google Scholar). Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All fluorescence measurements, obtained with a Shimadzu RF5000U spectrofluorometer, were carried out at 25 °C with ∼2 μm protein in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 1 mm EDTA, using an excitation wavelength of 290 and 5 nm excitation and emission slit widths. The wavelength maximum for PI-PLC fluorescence, 337 nm, was unaltered for WT and tryptophan mutants both in the absence and presence of ligands. There was no detectable light scattering for any of the protein samples with PC micelles added. Changes in the fluorescence intensity at 337 nm were expressed as (I–I0)/I0, where I0 is the intensity of protein alone, and I is the intensity in the presence of an additive. Kinetic Analysis of PI-PLC Mutants—PI-PLC activity was assayed by two methods. (i) For long chain PI as substrate, 200-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction mixture (typically 8 mm PI dispersed in 32 mm diC7PC or 30% iPrOH in 50 mm Tris, pH 7) at defined intervals and extracted with 200 μl of CHCl3 (this also stops the reaction). The content of cIP and I-1-P in the water-soluble phase was determined by 31P NMR (202.3 MHz) spectroscopy as described previously (9Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Google Scholar, 12Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11223-11233Google Scholar) using a Varian INOVA 500 spectrometer. (ii) For cIP as the substrate, the hydrolysis as monitored by 31P NMR spectroscopy quantified the decrease of substrate and increase in product (I-1-P) resonance intensities as a function of incubation time (9Zhou C. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 347-355Google Scholar, 25Zhou C. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16430-16439Google Scholar). The amount of protein added was adjusted so that no more than 20% substrate hydrolysis occurred in 2 h. Assays to check for activation by PC typically used 5 mm cIP in the absence or presence of 5 mm diC7PC to probe for PC activation. Samples were usually assayed in duplicate (and often in triplicate); errors in specific activities based on duplicate or triplicate samples were <10%. PC Vesicle Binding Studies—SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide) was used to quantify free PI-PLC separated (via centrifugation/filtration) from PI-PLC bound to POPC vesicles.2 A stock of small unilamellar POPC vesicles (5 mm) with an average diameter ∼300 Å (as estimated by light scattering using a Malvern particle sizer) was prepared by sonication in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. Vesicle samples were incubated with 0.03 mg/ml protein in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The bulk POPC concentration was 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 mm for WT PI-PLC and G238W and 0, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, and 0.2 mm for all double mutants. In the POPC binding assay with W47A/W242A, the bulk POPC concentration was increased to 2 mm. After incubation for 15 min, the samples were centrifuged to separate free protein from vesicle-bound protein (which was retained on the membrane). The eluant was collected and lyophilized overnight and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained gels were imaged and the PI-PLC intensities monitored. Comparison of band intensities to a sample carried through the filtration and centrifugation but without POPC vesicles was used to measure the fraction of free enzyme (ET/ET, where ET is the total amount of enzyme). The fraction of enzyme bound, Eb/ET, was then evaluated as (1–Ef /ET). The apparent dissociation constant (KD), which in this case represents the partitioning of the enzyme to the interface, was calculated with equation Eb/ET = [POPC]/(KD + [POPC]). This value is equivalent to (nKD) estimated with a Langmuir adsorption isotherm treatment of the protein binding with a dissociation constant KD to a site composed of n phospholipids (26Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Google Scholar, 27Stieglitz K. Seaton B. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35367-35374Google Scholar). The error in estimating the apparent dissociation constant for PC SUVs, KD, was <15%. Strategy for Tryptophan Rescue Mutants, Secondary Structure, and Thermostability—The active site of PI-PLC is located at the C-terminal side (as determined by strand orientation) of the distorted (βα)6-barrel. Helix B and loop 232–244 are at the mouth of the barrel (Fig. 1). The distance between Cα of Trp-47 to Cα of Trp-242 is 10.5 Å. These residues are both quite far from the active site, a measure of this is the distance between the Cα atoms of the two rim tryptophans and the Cα of Trp-178, a residue at the bottom of the active site that forms a hydrogen bond with a residue critical for substrate binding (Asp-198). Trp-47 is 22.9 Å and Trp-242 is 28.8 Å from the Trp-178 Cα. Because W47A and W242A exhibited impaired interfacial activation by PC and reduced affinities for PC surfaces, a series of tryptophan rescue double mutants was prepared to explore where a tryptophan could be reintroduced to restore enzymatic activity and activation by PC surfaces. Helix B has only two turns with Trp-47 at the C-terminal end of this short helix (Fig. 2A). Gln-45 is on the same turn as Trp-47 but with an orientation on the opposite face of the helix. Ile-43 is in the first turn of helix B and has the same orientation as Trp-47 but is displaced along the helix. Gly-48 and Met-49 residues follow Trp-47 but are not part of the short helix. Starting with W47A, each of these residues was replaced by tryptophan to test the importance of tryptophan placement in helix B for optimal catalysis and PC binding.Fig. 2A, orientation of Trp at different positions in helix B mutants. B, orientation of Trp at different positions in the 232–244 loop. These place the Trp in the orientation of the side chain that was replaced and do not represent energy-minimized conformations since most of these two structural features are fully exposed to solvent and hence very flexible in the absence of surfaces.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The 232–244 loop appears to be very flexible in the crystal structure, although replacement of Trp-242 by alanine profoundly effects PI cleavage and binding to PC vesicles (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). Because replacement of the tryptophan by phenylalanine or isoleucine rescued PI cleavage rates, insertion of a tryptophan at many positions in the loop could lead to WT behavior. With this in mind, we chose Ser-236, Gly-238, and Asn-243 as target positions to introduce tryptophan into the W242A protein (Fig. 2B). Asparagine and serine are uncharged polar residues; Asn-243 is adjacent to Trp-242, and Ser-236 is 6 residues away. Gly-238 is in the middle of the loop and might contribute significantly to loop flexibility. Therefore, mutation of glycine to tryptophan should alter the loop flexibility as well as significantly increase protein hydrophobicity, both properties of the local structure that could be relevant to PI-PLC interfacial activity. CD spectra of WT and mutant PI-PLC proteins were acquired and used to check for overall structural elements. A large change might not be expected in either secondary structure or stability, since helix B and loop 232–244 had weaker density in the crystal structure and were assumed to be flexible (4Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Google Scholar). Estimates of WT secondary structure calculated from the CD wavelength spectra by CDNN (23Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Google Scholar, 24Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Google Scholar) agreed moderately well with the secondary structure elements in the crystal structure (4Heinz D.W. Ryan M. Bullock T.L. Griffith O.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3855-3863Google Scholar), and nearly all the single and double tryptophan mutants had essentially the same proportion (±1%) of secondary structure elements (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar) and Tm values within 1 °Cofthe Tm for WT PI-PLC (54.4 °C). The one exception was M49W/W47A, which exhibited a 2 °C decrease in Tm. Residue 49 is close to the C-terminal end of helix B and interacts with other portions of the protein. Insertion of a bulky tryptophan side chain at this position could slightly destabilize the molecule. However, the lack of significant changes in secondary structure in all these PI-PLC mutants indicates that any changes in PC binding and kinetics are not due to protein that has a significantly altered structure. Catalytic Properties of Helix B Mutants—By using W47A activities (low compared with native protein (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar)) as a point of reference, cIP hydrolysis and PI cleavage activities of the helix B mutants were obtained. Of all the helix B double mutants constructed, only I43W/W47A had significantly increased specific activity toward PI in the presence of diC7PC compared with W47A (Fig. 3A). All the other mutants in this region of the protein had PI cleavage activity reduced compared with the parent W47A as follows: 53, 40, and 20% for G48W/W47A, M49W/W47A, and Q45W/W47A, respectively. Phosphodiesterase activities (cIP hydrolysis) of these mutants were consistent with the trends in PI hydrolysis. With 5 mm cIP, native PI-PLC activity was enhanced 8–9-fold with diC7PC added (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). W47A shows ∼60% of the diC7PC activation of WT (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). Hence, an improved double mutant would have a specific activity toward cIP in the presence of diC7PC higher than W47A. As shown in Fig. 3A, the specific activity of I43W/W47A toward cIP in the presence of PC micelles was basically the same as WT. The other helix B mutants exhibited cIP hydrolysis rates with diC7PC present that were less than W47A, indicating that PC activation of this step was not restored (and impaired even more than the removal of Trp-47 for some of the mutants). An alternate means of activating PI-PLC is the addition of moderate percentages of water-miscible organic solvents (18Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8514-8521Google Scholar). 30% iPrOH has been postulated to activate PI-PLC by changing the local polarity of the active site and also possibly altering the protein conformation slightly. This amount of water-miscible solvent solubilizes PI and can be used as an assay system for PI-PLC (19Wehbi H. Feng J. Roberts M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). In the presence of isopropyl alcohol, all helix B mutants, including I43W/W47A, which could be activated by diC7PC, showed reduced activity compared with WT protein that was comparable with that of W47A. A tryptophan at any position but residue 47 produces an enzyme that cannot be activated by iPrOH. These results indicate that not only orientation (face of the helix) but position of tryptophan in helix B is critical for optimized phosphotransferase and phosphodiesterase activities. Tryptophan (or a large hydrophobic group) located at residue 47 is absolutely necessary for PI cleavage to be enhanced by iPrOH. Catalytic Properties of Loop 232–244 Mutants—The specific activity of W242A toward PI solubilized in diC7PC was 3-fold less than WT. This mutant also showed impaired PC activation of cIP hydrolysis (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). Reinsertion of tryptophan at three different positions in the loop (residues 236, 238, and 243) was much more successful at increasing PI cleavage rates above that for W242A (Fig. 3B). For S236W/W242A and N243W/W242A the increases in PI cleavage rates (1.88- and 1.25-fold above W242A, respectively) were moderate, and specific activities were still less than that exhibited by WT enzyme. However, G238W/W242 was able to cleave PI with a rate 4.8-fold higher than W242A and 1.6-fold higher than WT in the presence of a PC interface. The movement of tryptophan from residue 242 in the loop to position 238 produces an enzyme with an enhanced capacity to cleave PI. With PI dispersed in water-miscible organic solvent (PI in 30% iPrOH), all three loop double mutants had higher activity than W242A, in fact N243W/W242A and G238W/W242A had activity comparable with WT enzyme. If loop 232–244 is a flexible structure, then one might expect insertion of tryptophan almost anywhere would enhance enzymatic activity, and indeed this occurs for PI cleavage. Enhanced specific activities toward cIP in the presence of diC7PC (compared with W242A) were also observed for G238W/W242A and N243W/W242A but not for S236W/W242A. Because G238W/W242A had high activity with PI in micellar diC7PC and in organic solvent, construction of the mutant G238W was undertaken. Addition of another tryptophan to this loop would be predicted to enhance binding of the protein to PC vesicles (assuming all rim tryptophans partition into the membrane) and might also enhance catalytic activity assuming surface binding and catalysis are coupled. Indeed, both G238W and G238W/W242A had similar activities toward PI (1.6-fold higher than WT) and similar rates toward cIP with diC7PC added (Fig. 3B). Placement of a tryptophan at residue 238 enhances interfacial activation compared with Trp-242. However, having two tryptophan residues in the 232–244 loop does not significantly increase activity any further. Binding of Mutant PI-PLC Enzymes to PC Vesicles—Moving tryptophan in helix B or loop 232–244 could alter the affinity of these mutants for activating interfaces (e.g. PC). This possibility was investigated by measuring the partitioning of all enzymes to PC SUVs using a centrifugation/filtration assay (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar, 27Stieglitz K. Seaton B. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35367-35374Google Scholar).2 The data were fit with a hyperbolic curve to generate an apparent dissociation constant, KD. The results, shown in Fig. 4, provide a way of comparing affinities of the different PI-PLCs for a PC surface. The apparent KD of WT PI-PLC for PC SUVs was 88 μm with the KD of W47A and W242A for PC vesicles ≥2 mm, and no significant binding of W47A/W242A to PC vesicles (16Feng J.W. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Google Scholar). For these mutants, PI cleavage rates and PC apparent KD values followed inverse trends: the higher the PI cleavage rate the lower KD. Apparent KD values and specific activity toward PI were loosely correlated for the helix B double mutants. Mutants with enhanced PI cleavage exhibited KD values lower than that for W47A. For example, the KD for I43W/W47A was 0.85 mm, 4-fold lower than W47A but still 10-fold higher than WT. Q45W/W47A had a similar KD value to W47A. The other two mutants, G48W/W47A and M49W/W47A, exhibited slightly improved binding affinity for POPC SUVs (KD of 0.45 and 1.02 mm, respectively). For each of the mutants one can predict the change in KD for a mutant compared with WT using the Wimley-White hydrophobicity scale (17Wimley W.C. White S.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 842-848Google Scholar) to estimate the change in ΔG caused by the replacement of a given residue by tryptophan and assuming that the residues so modified insert into a PC bilayer. As shown in Fig. 4A, inserting a tryptophan in place of Ile-43 or Gly-48 in helix B is compatible with partial (but not complete) insertion of the tryptophan into PC vesicles. However, only I43W/W47A was able to regain diC7PC activation of PI cleavage and cIP hydrolysis. In contrast to the helix B double mutants, apparent KD values for double mutants of the 232–244 loop were all significantly decreased (10–100-fold) compared with W242A (Fig. 4B). N243W/W242A had the largest discrepancy between experimental and predicted KD values suggesting that a tryptophan in this position is not effectively partitioning the protein to the membrane surface. The affinity of G238W/W242A for the PC surface was increased above that for WT protein, and the affinity of G238W with three tryptophan residues in the rim region was not dramatically enhanced over G238W/W242A.

Such a direct connection is not possible, however, if the surface of the star has been polluted by enriched material, either dredged from the star's interior or transferred from a companion star. Here we argue that, in the case of HE0107–5240 (ref. 1), the most iron-poor star known, the oxygen abundance could be a discriminant: a ratio of [O/Fe] exceeding +3.5 would favour a pristine origin of metals, whereas an [O/Fe] ratio of less than +3 would favour the pollution hypothesis. Using this criterion, we suggest how the required information on oxygen abundance might be obtained."
https://openalex.org/W1999123356,"Ovalbumin, a member of the serpin superfamily, contains one cystine disulfide (Cys73-Cys120) and four cysteine sulfhydryls (Cys11, Cys30, Cys367, and Cys382) in the native state. To investigate the folding mechanism of ovalbumin, a urea-denatured disulfide isomer with a mispaired disulfide Cys367-Cys382 (D[367–382]) and its derivative (D[367–382/CM-73]) in which a native cystine counterpart of Cys73 is blocked by carboxymethylation were produced. Both the denatured isomers refolded within an instrumental dead time of 4 ms into an initial burst intermediate IN with partially folded conformation. After the initial burst phase, most of the D[367–382] molecules further refolded into the native form. In contrast, upon dilution of D[367–382/CM-73] with the refolding buffer, the protein stayed in the IN state as a stable form, which displayed a partial regain of the native secondary structure and a compact conformation with a similar Stokes radius to the native form. The structural characteristics of IN were clearly differentiated from those of an equilibrium intermediate IA that was produced by dilution with an acidic buffer of urea-denatured ovalbumin; IA showed much more hydrophobic dye binding and a larger Stokes radius than the IN state, despite their indistinguishable far-UV circular dichroic spectra. The non-productive nature of IA highlighted the importance of a compact conformation of the IN state for subsequent native refolding. These observations were consistent with a refolding model of ovalbumin that includes the regain of the partial secondary structure and of the compactness of overall conformation in an initial burst phase before the subsequent native refolding.

These observations were consistent with a refolding model of ovalbumin that includes the regain of the partial secondary structure and of the compactness of overall conformation in an initial burst phase before the subsequent native refolding. The importance of protein folding studies has been increasing, because they give important information about the molecular mechanism for novel types of disease that involve a protein aggregation process (1Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Lancet. 1997; 350: 134-138Google Scholar, 2Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 10: 759-768Google Scholar, 3Dobson C.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 2001; 68: 1-26Google Scholar, 4Soto C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 204-207Google Scholar, 5Zerovnik E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3362-3371Google Scholar). The serpins, a group of serine proteinase inhibitors, are an interesting target for investigation of the protein folding mechanism. They undergo unique conformational change upon exerting the inhibition activity; after receiving cleavage at the P1-P1′ site by a target proteinase, the reactive center loop is inserted into the central β-sheet A (6Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Google Scholar). This dynamic conformational change accompanies a great structural stabilization and has been considered to be from a metastable state into a fully stabilized state (7Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Google Scholar). The folding analysis of serpins should therefore explain how a protein molecule folds into a metastable state with native protein nature. The folding process of serpins has, however, been poorly understood. This is largely related to the large protein size with a molecular mass of around 40 kDa, which makes it difficult for the application of powerful protein folding analysis, such as nuclear magnetic resonance.Ovalbumin, despite its non-inhibitory nature (8Stein P.E. Tewkesbury D.A. Carrell R.W. Biochem. J. 1989; 262: 103-107Google Scholar), is a member of the serpin superfamily, because of a close similarity in the primary and tertiary structures (9Wright H.T. Qian H.X. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 513-528Google Scholar, 10Stein P.E. Leslie A.G. Finch J.T. Turnell W.G. McLaughlin P.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1990; 347: 99-102Google Scholar, 11Stein P.E. Leslie A.G.W. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Google Scholar) and the specific loop cleavage at the canonical P1-P1′ site by a serine proteinase (12Wright H.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 269: 14335-14336Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent thermodynamic and crystallographic evidence from our laboratory has clearly demonstrated that ovalbumin exerts, by the replacement of a single hinge residue, the inherent metastable nature that undergoes structural transition into the loop-inserted, thermostabilized form following P1-P1′ cleavage (13Yamasaki M. Arii Y. Mikami B. Hirose M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 315: 113-120Google Scholar). Ovalbumin should be, therefore, a competent model for the analysis of the metastable folding mechanism. We have shown that intramolecular sulfhydryl/disulfide exchange reactions are a useful probe for the analysis of the unfolding and refolding process of ovalbumin (14Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28062-28067Google Scholar, 15Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 83-89Google Scholar, 16Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Google Scholar, 17Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11565-11572Google Scholar, 18Tatsumi E. Hirose M. J.

Ovalbumin consists of a single polypeptide chain of 385 amino acid residues and contains 6 cysteine residues of Cys11, Cys30, Cys73, Cys120, Cys367, and Cys382; only Cys73 and Cys120 form a disulfide bond in the native state (20Thompson E.O. Fisher W.K. Aust. J. Biol. Sci. 1978; 31: 433-442Google Scholar, 21Nisbet A.D. Saundry R.H. Moir A.J. Fothergill L.A. Fothergill J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 115: 335-345Google Scholar). Under highly denaturing conditions, the egg white protein undergoes extensive sulfhydryl/disulfide exchanges producing all the 15 possible disulfide isomers with one disulfide and four sulfhydryls (14Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28062-28067Google Scholar). Thus the disulfide isomers are distributed at equilibrium depending on loop length (the number of amino acid residues separating the two cysteines) to a power of about –2. From the complex denatured state, most of the ovalbumin molecules refold into the native form with Cys73-Cys120 through intrachain sulfhydryl/disulfide exchanges (15Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biochem. 1997; 122: 83-89Google Scholar). This enables us to investigate the refolding processes from different disulfide isomers with different conformational entropy. That the native cystine disulfide is regained without the help of an added chemical oxidant implies that the sulfhydryl accessibility problem (22Goto Y. Hamaguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 331-340Google Scholar, 23Weissman J.S Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1123-1130Google Scholar), inherently inevitable in the oxidative refolding system, can be circumvented. As an alternative advantage, a possible folding intermediate can be trapped in a stable form under native folding conditions, as demonstrated here, when one of the cysteine residues participating in the native disulfide bond is blocked.In a previous study using a disulfide isomer (16Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that the refolding process of ovalbumin includes a non-productive pathway as displayed in Scheme 1. When the urea-denatured isomer with the native disulfide Cys73-Cys120 (D[73–120]), 1Disulfide and sulfhydryl structures are shown using the residue numbers in bracket (e.g. [73–120] for Cys73-Cys120 and [CM-73] for carboxymethylated form of Cys73) and attached on the right side of a protein state (e.g. N, D, and IN for the native, denatured, and intermediate states, respectively). 1Disulfide and sulfhydryl structures are shown using the residue numbers in bracket (e.g. [73–120] for Cys73-Cys120 and [CM-73] for carboxymethylated form of Cys73) and attached on the right side of a protein state (e.g. N, D, and IN for the native, denatured, and intermediate states, respectively). produced by protein incubation under acid/urea conditions, is diluted into a near neutral folding buffer, ovalbumin forms an initial burst intermediate IN[73–120]. This intermediate can correctly refold into the native form N[73–120] with a first-order rate constant kf of about 0.2 min–1. At the same time, however, the intermediate IN[73–120] undergoes reversible intrachain sulfhydryl/disulfide exchanges, upon generating the mispaired disulfide intermediate pool, IN[mis-SS].In the present study, we have prepared alternative denatured disulfide isomers: the disulfide isomer with mispaired Cys367-Cys382 (D[367–382]) and its derivative (D[367–382/CM-73]) in which a counterpart cysteine of the native disulfide, Cys73, is blocked by S-carboxymethylation. Here we demonstrate that the mispaired disulfide isomer D[367–382] can correctly refold into N[73–120] through disulfide rearrangements. In contrast, D[367–382/CM-73] stays in the intermediate IN state under the native refolding conditions. The stable nature of the intermediate enabled us to analyze its conformational characteristics by several conventional approaches.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Ovalbumin (A1-ovalbumin, diphosphorylated form) was purified from fresh egg white by crystallization in an ammonium sulfate solution and subsequent ion exchange column chromatography as described previously (24Søensen S.P.L. Hørup M. Comp. Rend. Trav. Lab. Carlsberg. 1915–1917; 29: 12-67Google Scholar, 25Kitabatake N. Ishida A. Doi E. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1988; 52: 967-973Google Scholar). Native cystine-reduced ovalbumin, N[SH], was prepared by incubation of ovalbumin (20 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h with 15 mm DTT 2The abbreviations used are: DTT, dithiothreitol; Pyr-S-S-Pyr, 2,2′-dipyridyl disulfide; Pyr-SH, 2-thiopyridone; IAA, monoiodoacetic acid; ANS, anilino-1-naphthalene-8-sulfonate; CD, circular dichroism. in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, containing 1mm sodium EDTA). N[CM-73] was prepared by incubation of N[SH] at 37 °C for 10 min with 40 mm IAA in buffer B. Under the conditions, the sulfhydryl of Cys73 was specifically carboxymethylated in N[SH] with a yield of 99%. The conformational state of N[CM-73] was almost indistinguishable from disulfide-intact ovalbumin as evaluated by far-UV CD and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra and trypsin resistance analyses (data not shown).Diphenylcarbamyl chloride-treated trypsin (type XI), chymotrypsin (type II), rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase (type XI), human transferrin (grade II), and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Bovine liver catalase and bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase were purchased from Nacalai Tesuque. Achromobacter proteinase I (EC 3.4.21.50) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemical.Preparation of Urea-denatured, Mispaired Disulfide Isomers—The outline of preparation of the urea-denatured mispaired disulfide isomers D[367–382] and D[367–382/CM-73] is shown in Fig. 1. Step 1 was to produce a mixed-disulfide protein derivative; native ovalbumin (20 mg/ml) was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with 2 mm Pyr-S-S-Pyr in buffer A (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 2.2, containing 1 mm sodium EDTA), then excess Pyr-S-S-Pyr and Pyr-SH were removed by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-10 column (Amersham Biosciences, NAP-10) equilibrated with buffer B. In Step 2, the native cystine disulfide Cys73-Cys120 of the derivative was reduced by incubation at 37 °Cfor1h with 15 mm DTT in buffer B, then the sample was passed through a Sephadex G-10 column equilibrated with buffer A. The urea-denatured, mispaired protein D[367–382] was produced in Step 3 by incubation of the cystine-reduced, mixed-disulfide derivative at 37 °C for 30 min with 6 m urea in buffer A; during this incubation, a mispaired disulfide Cys367-Cys382 and Pyr-SH are produced by the attack of the Cys382 sulfhydryl against the mixed-disulfide of Cys367 (19Tatsumi E. Yoshimatsu D. Hirose M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12351-12359Google Scholar).Fig. 1Schematic presentation for the preparation of urea-denatured mispaired disulfide isomers D[367–382] and D[367–382/CM-73].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Another urea-denatured mispaired disulfide isomer, D[367–382/CM-73] was prepared in the same way except that the Cys73 sulfhydryl was carboxymethylated, prior to Step 3, by incubation of the cystine-reduced, mixed-disulfide derivative with 40 mm IAA at 37 °C for 10 min. Disulfide-reduced, urea-denatured proteins D[SH] and D[CM-73] were prepared by incubation of D[367–382] and D[367–382/CM-73] with 5 mm DTT at 37 °C for 30 min in buffer B containing 9 m urea, respectively.The urea-denatured samples D[367–382], D[367–382/CM-73], D[SH], and D[CM-73] were passed through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 0.25 m HCl containing 9 m urea and 1 mm sodium EDTA (pH 2.2), and the protein concentration was adjusted at 1.0 mg/ml in the same acid/urea/EDTA solution, where possible sulfhydryl/disulfide exchanges are completely blocked.Refolding of the Urea-denatured Proteins—Refolding was initiated at 25 °C by 20-fold dilution of the urea-denatured proteins with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.6, containing 1 mm sodium EDTA) giving a final pH value of 8.2. The proteins were allowed to refold at 25 °C. An equilibrium intermediate IA was produced by 20-fold dilution of the urea-denatured proteins with buffer A. The buffers were degassed at reduced pressure and equilibrated under N2 atmosphere prior to the refolding and contained 0.5 mm DTT for the experiments for the disulfide-reduced proteins.Analysis for Disulfide-involved Cysteines—Disulfide-involved cysteines were determined by a peptide mapping analysis as described previously (14Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28062-28067Google Scholar). Briefly, the urea-denatured protein in acidic pH conditions was neutralized by addition of 1 m Tris solution and alkylated with 0.1 m iodoacetamide in the presence of 9 m urea. The alkylated protein was precipitated in a cold acetone-HCl solution, dissolved in buffer B containing 8 m urea, reduced with DTT, and then modified with a fluorescent alkylation reagent, N-iodoacetyl-N′-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine. The modified protein was extensively proteolyzed with combinations of trypsin, chymotrypsin, and Achromobacter protease I. The resultant peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and the modified cysteine peptides were detected by fluorescence (excitation, 340 nm; emission, 520 nm).For the refolding analysis, sulfhydryl/disulfide exchanges were quenched at various refolding times by mixing the protein samples with a 0.24 volume of 2 m HCl. Disulfide-involved cysteines were determined in the same way.Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence and Far-UV CD Spectrum—The fluorescence spectrum of ovalbumin was measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, model F-3000). The intrinsic tryptophan residues in ovalbumin were excited at 295 nm, and emission spectrum was recorded at a wavelength range from 300 to 420 nm. All measurements were carried out at a constant temperature of 25 °C.For the spectrum measurements at an early refolding time, a stopped-flow reaction analyzer (Applied Photophysics Ltd., UK) was employed. The time course of fluorescence intensity changes was monitored at various emission wavelengths (excitation wavelength, 295 nm), and the data at a refolding time of 5 ms were plotted. For the control experiments, the native ovalbumin and the urea-denatured proteins were diluted, respectively, by the refolding buffer (buffer C) containing 0.82 m urea and by 0.25 m HCl containing 9 m urea and 1 mm sodium EDTA (pH 2.2), and the fluorescence intensity at 338 nm was recorded in the same way. The averaged data of 10–15 traces were obtained. The dead time for mixing was determined to be 4 ms by a model reaction between 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol and l-ascorbate (26Tonomura B. Nakatani H. Ohnishi M. Yamaguchi-Ito J. Hiromi K. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 370-383Google Scholar).The far-UV CD spectrum was recorded at 25 °C with a spectropolarimeter (JASCO, J-720). The CD data were expressed as mean residue ellipticity (degrees·cm2/dmol) by using 111 as the mean residue weight of ovalbumin. CD spectra at a short refolding time were determined by measuring the time-dependent increase in CD ellipticities at various wavelengths, and the values at the 10-s refolding time were plotted as a function of the wavelength. The averages of eight time traces were determined.The time course of the refolding after the initial burst phase was monitored by the CD ellipticity at 222 nm and the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence excited at 295 nm. The data were obtained as the averages of triplicate determinations. The fraction of the native form at the refolding time of t “FN(t)” was calculated by using the equation: FN(t) = (X0–Xt)/(X0–XN), where X0 and Xt are the initial values and the values at the refolding time t, respectively. For the CD and fluorescence analyses, the values at 6-s and 5-ms refolding were taken as X0, respectively. XN is the value of the native form.ANS Binding Experiments—Ovalbumin in the various states was mixed at 50 μg/ml with 0.005 volume of 4.02 mm ANS solution, and the fluorescence emission spectra were measured with a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi, F-3000) after 30 s of the mixing. ANS was excited at 350 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a wavelength range from 390 nm to 610 nm.For the spectrum measurements at the refolding time of 30 s, the urea-denatured proteins (1.0 mg/ml) were diluted 20-fold with buffer C containing 21 μm ANS, and the time course of fluorescence intensity change was monitored at various emission wavelengths (the excitation wavelength, 350 nm). The obtained data at a refolding time of 30 s were plotted as a function of the emission wavelength. The averages of eight time traces were determined. The time course of fluorescence intensity change was monitored at 470-nm emission, and the data were obtained as the averages of triplicate determinations.Trypsin Resistance Assay—The regain of the native conformation during the refolding was examined by a trypsin resistance assay, because the protein in the native state, but not in the non-native state, is highly resistant against trypsin (17Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11565-11572Google Scholar). At various refolding times, the protein was mixed with 0.01 volume of 12.5 mg/ml trypsin and digested at 25 °C for 1 min. The digestion was terminated by addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (17Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11565-11572Google Scholar). The proteins were electrophoresed on an SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide/0.27% bisacrylamide), according to the standard method of Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar), and then stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The amount of trypsin-resistant ovalbumin was determined from the band intensity with a densitometer (Shimadzu, CS-9000). The data were obtained as the averages of eight time determinations.Differential Scanning Calorimetry—The denatured proteins were refolded for 20 h and concentrated about 15-fold using a concentrator (Amicon, Centriprep-10). The refolded proteins and native protein controls were analyzed with a differential scanning calorimeter (Micro Cal, MCS-DSC). The protein concentration was 0.5 mg/ml in buffer B, and the rate of temperature change was 1 K·min–1.Size-exclusion Chromatography—Analytical gel filtration chromatography of various states of ovalbumin was performed on a TSK gel column (G3000SWXL, 7.8 mm × 30 cm) joined to a high performance liquid chromatography apparatus (Shimadzu, LC-10A). Proteins were chromatographed in buffer B (for the native and refolded proteins), in buffer A (for the IA state), or in 9 m urea-0.25 m HCl (for the urea-denatured proteins) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at 25 °C. Eluted protein was detected by absorbance at 220 nm with a UV absorbance monitor (Shimadzu, SPD-2AS). The Stokes radius was determined by the method of Corbett and Roche (28Cobett R.J.T. Roche R.S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1888-1894Google Scholar). The protein standards used were catalase, lactate dehydrogenase, human transferrin, bovine serum albumin, and bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase. The void volume and total solvent-accessible volume of the column were determined from the elution volumes of blue dextran and sodium azide, respectively. The data (Table I) are the averages with standard deviations of quadruplicate determinations.Table IStokes radii of ovalbumin in various statesSamplesStokes radiiÅN[73-120]30.3 ± 0.06N[SH]30.7 ± 0.12N[CM-73]31.0 ± 0.10IA[73-120]38.6 ± 0.21IA[SH]39.0 ± 0.09IA[CM-73]39.4 ± 0.15IA[367-382]39.0 ± 0.12IA[367-382/CM-73]39.2 ± 0.17D[73-120]58.2 ± 0.17D[SH]59.1 ± 0.12D[CM-73]59.5 ± 0.06D[367-382]58.6 ± 0.21D[367-382/CM-73]58.5 ± 0.19IN (16 min)32.5 ± 0.18IN (120 min)31.8 ± 0.18IN (20 h)31.6 ± 0.15 Open table in a new tab RESULTSPreparation of Mispaired Disulfide Isomers—Urea-denatured mispaired disulfide isomers D[367–382] and D[367–382/CM-73] were prepared as summarized in Fig. 1. Ovalbumin takes a highly ordered molten-globule state at acidic pH, and Pyr-S-S-Pyr reacts specifically with the Cys367 sulfhydryl at pH 2.2 (19Tatsumi E. Yoshimatsu D. Hirose M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12351-12359Google Scholar). By use of the reaction, a mixed-disulfide protein derivative was produced in Step 1. As Step 2, the native cystine Cys73-Cys120 in the derivative was reduced with DTT at near neutral pH, generating the cystine-reduced, mixed-disulfide derivative. In the presence of a high concentration of urea at pH 2.2, Pyr-SH is released from the mixed disulfide derivative by the nucleophilic attack of the nearest cysteine residue in the primary structure, Cys382 (19Tatsumi E.

Thus the mispaired disulfide isomer D[367–382] was prepared by placing the cystine-reduced, mixed-disulfide derivative in acidic urea denaturing conditions as Step 3. The specific disulfide formation between Cys367 and Cys382 in the urea-denatured sample was confirmed by a peptide mapping analysis as shown in Fig. 2A; this figure clearly shows that almost all of the disulfide-forming cysteines consisted of Cys367 and Cys382. By comparison with the overall labeling analysis that leads to the detection of all the six cysteines (Fig. 2B), the yield of D[367–382] was estimated to be more than 97%.Fig. 2Peptide-mapping analysis for the disulfide isomers. The disulfide-involved cysteines were analyzed for D[367–382] (A) and D[367–382/CM-73] (C) as described in the text. In B and D, the overall labeling experiments by which all the cysteine residues are alkylated with a fluorescent probe were done for D[367–382] and D[367–382/CM-73], respectively. The numbers above the peaks represent the residue numbers of the labeled cysteines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The other urea-denatured mispaired disulfide isomer D[367–382/CM-73] was prepared by inclusion of the carboxymethylation of the Cys73 sulfhydryl prior to Step 3 (Fig. 1). In the native conformation at near neutral pH, an alkylation reagent, such as IAA, is inaccessible to the sulfhydryls of Cys11, Cys30, Cys367, and Cys382, but Cys73 and Cys120 can be readily alkylated in their reduced state with IAA (17Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11565-11572Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the Cys73 sulfhydryl is more reactive to IAA than the Cys120 sulfhydryl and that, in an optimized condition, Cys73 can be specifically carboxymethylated. As shown in Fig. 2D, when the cystine-reduced, mixed-disulfide derivative was carboxymethylated with 40 mm IAA at pH 8.2 (producing the carboxymethylated, mixed-disulfide derivative) and then subjected to the overall labeling analysis, the Cys73 sulfhydryl was found to be almost completely blocked, but no other cysteine sulfhydryls were carboxymethylated with IAA. The carboxymethylated, mixed-disulfide derivative was then denatured during Step 3, and the sample was analyzed for the disulfide-forming cysteines by the peptide mapping method. As shown in Fig. 2C, the disulfide-forming cysteines comprise almost totally Cys367 and Cys382.Ovalbumin can also refold correctly without any intrachain disulfide through an equivalent intermediate IN state (16Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Google Scholar); the absence of the interconversion of IN with IN[mis-SS] pool results in a more straightforward refolding of ovalbumin (16Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Google Scholar). The refolding under disulfide-reduced conditions was therefore employed as a control experiment in the present refolding study. The starting samples of the urea-denatured disulfide-reduced forms D[SH] and D[CM-73] were prepared by reduction with DTT of the disulfide-bonded counterparts of D[367–382] and D[367–382/CM-73], respectively.Refolding Detected by Optical Methods—The conformational change during the ovalbumin refolding was examined by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, far-UV CD spectrum and ANS binding analyses. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), all the urea-denatured proteins showed typical fluorescence and CD spectra for the unfolded protein; essentially no spectrum difference was detected among the different urea-denatured proteins. The native ovalbumin and the urea-denatured proteins displayed the maximum fluorescence at 338 and 352 nm, respectively, and the maximum fluorescence intensity of the urea-denatured proteins was about 33% of that of the native ovalbumin.Fig. 3Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (A), far-UV CD spectrum (B), and ANS binding (C) analyses. The spectra shown are: the native ovalbumin (N[73–120], thick solid line), the urea-denatured disulfide isomers (D, dashed lines), the proteins refolded for 20 h from the urea-denatured disulfide isomers (20H, dotted lines), and the equilibrium intermediate state IA produced by dilution of the urea-denatured disulfide isomers with acidic buffer (IA, thin solid lines). In C, the fluorescence of ANS was almost undetectable in the presence of the native proteins (N) and of the urea-denatured proteins (D). The attached lowercase italic letters on the right side of D represent the disulfide type (a, D[367–382]; b, D[367–382/CM-73]; c, D[SH]; and d, D[CM-73]) and are arranged from the top to the bottom according to the fluorescence intensity at the peak wavelength or the absolute value of CD ellipticities at 222 nm. The attached lowercase italic letters on the right or left side of 20H and IA represent the disulfide type of urea-denatured protein before dilution to produce 20H and IA and are arranged in the same way as for D. For the fluorescence spectra at a refolding time of 5 ms (5MS), the time course of fluorescence changes was recorded using a stopped-flow apparatus during refolding from D[367–382/CM-73] (open squares), D[367–382] (crosses), D[CM-73] (open circles), and D[SH] (open triangles) at different emission wavelengths, and the values at the refolding time of 5 ms were plotted as a function of the emission wavelengths. For the CD spectra at a refolding time of 10 s (10S), the time course of changes in CD ellipticities at different wavelengths were recorded during refolding from the urea-denatured disulfide isomers (the same symbols are used for each isomer) after manual mixing, and the values at the refolding time of 10 s were plotted as a function of wavelength. The ANS spectrum 30S (open squares with solid curve) corresponds to the partially folded intermediate IN that was produced by the refolding for 30 s from D[367–382/CM-73] and is depicted as described in the text. In the inset of panel A, D[367–382] was refolded and the changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence at 338 n"
https://openalex.org/W2075912964,"Pigeon cytosolic malic enzyme has a double dimer quaternary structure with three tryptophanyl residues in each monomer distributed in different structural domains. The enzyme showed a three-state unfolding phenomenon upon increasing the urea concentration (Chang, H. C., Chou, W. Y., and Chang, G. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 4663–4671). At urea concentration of 4–4.5 m, where the intermediate form was detected, the enzyme existed as partially unfolded dimers, which were easily polymerized. Mn2+ provided full protection against the polymerization. To further characterize this phenomenon, three mutants of the enzyme (W129, W321, and W548), each with only one tryptophanyl residue left, were constructed. All these mutants were successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli cells and purified to homogeneity. Changes in the circular dichroism spectra of all mutants revealed a three-state urea-unfolding process in the absence of Mn2+. In the presence of 4 mm Mn2+, W548 and wild type (WT) enzymes shifted to monophasic, while W129 and W321 were still biphasic. Similar results were obtained from the fluorescence spectral changes, except for W321, which showed monophasic denaturation curve with or without Mn2+. Analytical ultracentrifugation analysis indicated that the mutant enzymes were polymerized at 4.5 m urea, and Mn2+ provided protective effect on W548 and WT enzymes only. Other mutants with mutated Trp-548 polymerized at 4.5 m urea in the absence or presence of 4 mm Mn2+. The above results indicate that a single residue, Trp-548, in the subunit interface region, is responsible for the integrity of the quaternary structure of the pigeon cytosolic malic enzyme. Pigeon cytosolic malic enzyme has a double dimer quaternary structure with three tryptophanyl residues in each monomer distributed in different structural domains. The enzyme showed a three-state unfolding phenomenon upon increasing the urea concentration (Chang, H. C., Chou, W. Y., and Chang, G. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 4663–4671).

The above results indicate that a single residue, Trp-548, in the subunit interface region, is responsible for the integrity of the quaternary structure of the pigeon cytosolic malic enzyme. Pigeon cytosolic malic enzyme is a tetramer with a double dimer quaternary structure, a structure common to all malic enzymes (1Yang Z. Zhang H. Hung H.C. Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Yuan H.S. Chou W.Y. Chang G.G. Tong L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 332-341Google Scholar, 2Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 877-889Google Scholar, 3Yang Z. Floyd D.L. Loeber G. Tong L.

For pigeon enzyme, the dimer and the tetramer interfaces have been demonstrated to have different sensitivities to pH (5Chang G.G. Huang T.M. Chang T.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 123-130Google Scholar, 6Huang T.M. Chang G.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12658-12664Google Scholar). The dissociated monomers seem to be enzymatically fully active (7Chang G.G. Huang T.M. Chang T.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 1159-1165Google Scholar), compatible with the structure that the active site region is remote from the subunit interface region. Each monomer of the enzyme was divided into four domains. The active site of the enzyme is located at the interface between domains B and C, together with contributions from a few residues of domain A. The divalent cation, Mn2+, which plays dual catalytic and structural roles in the enzyme mechanism, is bound deeply in the active site cleft (1Yang Z. Zhang H. Hung H.C. Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Yuan H.S. Chou W.Y. Chang G.G. Tong L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 332-341Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). There are three tryptophanyl residues of each monomer, distributed in different domains of the enzyme. Trp-129 is in the dimer interface, Trp-548 is in the tetramer interface, and Trp-321 is in a position not involved in the subunit association. The fluorescence from the individual tryptophanyl residues thus can be an excellent tool in examining the structural role of the corresponding domains (8Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Google Scholar, 9Steer B.A. Merrill A.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7225-7233Google Scholar, 10Tew D.J. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4663-4671Google Scholar). A partially unfolded dimeric form was populated at a urea concentration of 4–4.5 m. This intermediate unfolded form gets polymerized easily in the absence of a metal ion. To further characterize this interesting phenomenon, three mutants of the enzyme (W129, W321, and W548) 1The abbreviations used are: W129 (or more precisely, W321F/W548F), double substitution mutant of the enzyme with residue Trp-129 unchanged but Trp-321 and Trp-548 changed to phenylalanine; W321 (W129F/W548F), Trp-321 unchanged but Trp-129 and Trp-548 changed to phenylalanine; W548 (W129F/W321F), Trp-548 unchanged but Trp-129 and Trp-321 changed to phenylalanine; WT, wild type pigeon liver malic enzyme. 1The abbreviations used are: W129 (or more precisely, W321F/W548F), double substitution mutant of the enzyme with residue Trp-129 unchanged but Trp-321 and Trp-548 changed to phenylalanine; W321 (W129F/W548F), Trp-321 unchanged but Trp-129 and Trp-548 changed to phenylalanine; W548 (W129F/W321F), Trp-548 unchanged but Trp-129 and Trp-321 changed to phenylalanine; WT, wild type pigeon liver malic enzyme. were constructed. Each mutant has only one tryptophanyl residue remaining in the enzyme molecule as indicated by the nomenclature that has been defined. These mutants were used as tools to assess the functional role of different domains in the quaternary structure stability of malic enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis—The full-length pigeon liver cytosolic malic enzyme cDNA was cloned in the pET21b vector for expression and site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (12Chou W.Y. Huang S.M. Chang G.G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1205-1211Google Scholar). This construct yielded the malic enzyme protein without any extra tag amino acid residues at the N terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to the procedures of Kunkel et al. (13Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar). The synthetic oligonucleotides used as mutagenic primers were: W129F, 5′-GCTTCAATCCTTCCCAGAAAGTGT-3′; W321F, 5′-CAAAAGGATATTCATGGTTGATTC-3′; W548F, 5′-CTCCTATACCTTCCCTGAAGAAGC-3′. The pET21-ME recombinant phagemids were amplified in the ung– and dut– CJ236 Escherichia coli strain with the helper phage R408 for preparation of the uracil-containing DNA template. The latter was annealed with phosphorylated mutagenic oligonucleotides and in vitro extended and ligated by T4 DNA polymerase and T4 DNA ligase, respectively. The mutated DNA was screened by transforming into the ung+ and dut+ JM109 E. coli strain, and the survival colonies were further identified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing (14Sanger F. Nicklen D. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar). The entire cDNA was also sequenced to exclude any unexpected mutations resulting from in vitro DNA polymerase extension. The absence of adventitious base changes was verified in all recombinant malic enzymes.Expression and Purification of the Recombinant Pigeon Liver Malic Enzyme—The recombinant DNA plasmid was transformed into BL21 bacterial strain. Enzyme synthesis was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside into the LB medium. After 20-h incubation at 25 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. Purification of the recombinant pigeon liver malic enzyme was carried out according to the protocol described previously (12Chou W.Y. Huang S.M. Chang G.G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1205-1211Google Scholar). All purified enzymes were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to examine the purity.Malic enzyme activity was assayed according to the published procedure (15Chang G.G. Huang T.M. Wang J.K. Lee H.J. Chou W.Y. Meng C.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 468-473Google Scholar). Apparent Michaelis constants for the substrate and cofactors were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate (or cofactors) around its Km value while maintaining other components constant and at the saturation levels. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data to appropriate kinetic models. The calculation was carried out with Sigma Plot 5.0 program (Jandel, San Rafael, CA).Enzyme Denaturation in Urea Solution—WT or mutant malic enzymes preincubated with or without 4 mm Mn2+ were denatured with various concentrations of freshly prepared urea in Tris acetate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) at 25 °C for 1 h. The unfolding of the enzyme was monitored by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopic techniques.Fluorescence spectra of the recombinant malic enzymes were analyzed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS 50B luminescence spectrometer at 25 °C. All spectra were corrected for the buffer absorption. Both the red shift and the fluorescence intensity changes were analyzed together using the average emission wavelength method (16Sánchez del Pino M.M. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5560-5565Google Scholar). The average emission wavelength (<λ>) was calculated according to the following equation, <λ>=∑i=λ1λN(Fi·λi)∑i=λ1λNFi (Eq. 1) in which F is the fluorescence intensity and λ the emission fluorescence wavelength.The CD measurements were made with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length cell under constant N2 flush. Three repetitive scans between 250 and 200 nm were averaged. Parallel spectra of urea solution without protein were also recorded and subtracted from the sample spectra. Mean residue ellipticity (Φ) was calculated by the following equation, Φ=[Φ]222MMRW/10dc(Eq. 2) in which the weight of mean amino acid residue, MMRW, is 111.42. d is the cell path in cm, and c is the enzyme concentration in mg/ml. The unfolded fraction values (fU) were then calculated according to the following equation (17Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Google Scholar, 18Pace C.N. Trends Biotechnol. 1990; 8: 93-98Google Scholar), fU = (yN−y)/(yN−yU)(Eq. 3) in which y is the observed CD signal. yN and yU are the values of y for the folded and unfolded forms, respectively, under the conditions where y is being measured. The fraction of the folded form is thus obtained by the following relationship: fN = 1 – fU.Characterization of Polymerization of Malic Enzyme during Urea Denaturation by Analytical Ultracentrifugation and Dynamic Light Scattering Measurements—The sedimentation coefficients of the enzyme under various conditions were estimated by a Beckman-Coulter XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge with an An60Ti rotor. Sedimentation velocity was performed at 20 °C and 40,000 rpm with standard double sectors aluminum centerpieces. The UV absorption of the cells was scanned every 5 min for 2 h. The data were analyzed with the SedFit version 8.5 program (19Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Google Scholar, 20Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Google Scholar, 21Schuck P. Perugini M.A. Gonzales N.R. Howlett G.J. Schubert D. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 1096-1111Google Scholar) (web site: www.analyticalultracentrifugation.com/). The solvent density and viscosity in the presence of urea were corrected with the UltraScan version 5.0 (22Demeler B. Saber H. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 444-454Google Scholar) (web site: www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu/). A partial specific volume of 0.7403 was used for malic enzyme (23Nevaldine B.H. Bassel A.R. Hsu R.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 283-293Google Scholar). All samples were visually checked for clarity after ultracentrifugation.The particle size of the protein polymers was estimated by a Photel dynamic light scattering spectrophotometer (DLS-700) at 20 °C. The light source was a He-Ne laser beam at wavelength of 632.8 nm. The buffer (100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4) and urea in the same buffer solutions were filtered through a glass fiber membrane (0.22 μm, Millipore AP 20) to remove fine particles before determination. A modified non-linear least square method based on Zimm's formalism was used in the estimation of particle size distribution (24Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Google Scholar).RESULTSCharacterization of the Tryptophan Mutants of Pigeon Liver Malic Enzyme—The fluorescence of the indole moiety is highly sensitive to its environment. This makes tryptophan an ideal residue to monitor the conformational changes of protein molecule (25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Plenum, New York1999: 237-266Google Scholar). Each subunit of the pigeon malic enzyme contains three tryptophanyl residues, located at positions 129, 321, and 548, respectively. Changing any two Trp to Phe results in a mutant with only one Trp left. When excited at 295 nm, only the structural change around that Trp will be reflected by the fluorescence measurement.All these three tryptophan mutants and the WT malic enzyme gave similar far-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 2A), indicating that the substitutions do not alter the secondary structure of the enzyme.Fig. 2Circular dichroism and fluorescence spectra of WT and mutant pigeon liver malic enzymes. The CD (A) and fluorescence (B) spectra of the various recombinant malic enzymes were recorded at 25 °C. The fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The same concentration (0.87 mg/ml in CD and 0.2 mg/ml in fluorescence) was used for all recombinant malic enzymes to monitor the spectra: closed circles, WT; open circles, W129; closed triangles, W321; open triangles, W548. In B, the stars represent the summation spectrum from all mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The kinetic parameters of these mutants are shown in Table I. Since none of the mutated Trp residues are located at the active site, the Km,Mg and Km,Mal values of the mutants do not differ significantly from those of WT. The Km,NADP value of W129 increased by a factor of 6.5 and that for W548 decreases by a factor of 4 than that of the WT (Table I). These results are conceivable, since W321 was closest to the NADP+ binding site (Fig. 1) but was changed to phenylalanine in the W129 and W548 mutants. The kcat values of all mutants, however, were similar to that of the WT value. The above results, therefore, indicated that the tryptophan to phenylalanine substitution does not affect the structural and functional integrity of the enzyme.Table IKinetic parameters for the WT and tryptophan mutant pigeon liver malic enzymesKm,MgKm,MalKm,NADPkcatmMmMμMs-1WT0.26 ± 0.030.29 ± 0.032.49 ± 0.16112 ± 11W1290.22 ± 0.010.37 ± 0.0216.1 ± 2.63116 ± 10W3210.18 ± 0.010.39 ± 0.021.91 ± 0.15136 ± 9W5480.12 ± 0.020.39 ± 0.060.61 ± 0.13125 ± 22 Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Spectral Properties of the Tryptophan Mutants of Pigeon Liver Malic Enzyme—The fluorescence emission maximum (λ ex = 295 nm) for the WT, W129, W321, and W548 were located at 333, 324, 338, and 329 nm, respectively (Fig. 2B). All these spectra were shifted to 358 nm when denatured with 8.3 m urea.The fluorescence intensities of the mutants, however, were drastically decreased due to the fact that only one tryptophanyl residue remained in each mutant (Fig. 2B). At equal protein concentration, the sum of the mutant fluorescence emission spectra does not match to the WT value. It suggests small structural perturbations of the mutations. Alternatively, it may imply that in WT there is some degree of energy transfer of the tryptophanyl residues, probably between Trp-129 of subunit “a” and Trp-548 of subunit “d” (see “Discussion”) (25Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Kluwer/Plenum, New York1999: 237-266Google Scholar).Denaturation of WT and Tryptophan-mutated Malic Enzymes Monitored by the Intrinsic Fluorescence Changes—Urea-induced denaturation of the WT and tryptophan mutated malic enzymes were monitored by the change in fluorescence emission spectrum at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The results were plotted by taking the average emission wavelength (Fig. 3, A–D) and integrated fluorescence area (Fig. 3, E–H) versus urea concentration. These results are similar to those previously reported for WT enzyme where excitation at 280 nm was performed (11Chang H.C. Chou W.Y. Chang G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4663-4671Google Scholar). Biphasic and monophasic unfolding processes were observed for the WT enzyme in the absence and presence of Mn2+, respectively. The corresponding [urea]0.5 values of WT were 2.5, 5.2, and 4.6 m, respectively, for the biphasic and monophasic denaturation unfolding process. The W129 yielded biphasic, but W321 gave a monophasic unfolding curve. Only W548 gave identical results with those of WT. Metal ion provides protection on WT and W548 (Fig. 3, A, D, E, and H). No protective effect was found for W129 or W321 (Fig. 3, B, C, F, and G).Fig. 3Comparison of the average emission fluorescence wavelength and fluorescence integrated area changes of WT and mutant pigeon liver malic enzymes during urea denaturation. The WT (A and E) and mutants (B and F, W129; C and G, W321; D and H, W548) were preincubated with (closed circles) or without (open circles) 4 mm Mn2+ and then mixed with various concentrations of urea at 25 °C for 1 h. The enzyme concentration was 0.23 mg/ml for all enzyme preparations. A–D, average emission wavelength collected at excitation wavelength of 295 nm. E–H, fluorescence emission integrated area between 320 and 370 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The increase in the characteristic integrated fluorescence area between 3 and 6 m urea in the WT enzyme in the absence of Mn2+ is even more prominent in W129 (Fig. 3F). It indicates that Trp-129 has a different microenvironment from the other two tryptophanyl residues in the intermediate state. Lacking this Trp, W321 and W548 do not have this characteristic peak (Fig. 3, G and H).Unfolding of WT and Tryptophan-mutated Malic Enzymes Monitored by Far-UV CD Changes—The unfolding process of WT and tryptophan-mutated malic enzymes were further monitored by CD spectral change (Fig. 4). The changes in far-UV CD monitored at 222 nm were converted to folded fractions and then plotted against urea concentration. All four enzymes were unfolded via a three state pathway, indicating the presence of at least one intermediate. In the presence of 4 mm Mn2+, W129 and W321 still showed a biphasic phenomenon but W548 and WT changed to monophasic.Fig. 4Comparison of the urea denaturation profiles of WT and mutant pigeon liver malic enzymes using circular dichroism as the physical probe. The WT (A) and mutants (B, W129; C, W321; and D, W548) were preincubated with (closed circles) or without (open circles) Mn2+ and then denatured with urea under the same conditions as described in Fig. 3. The mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm, which was changed to the fraction of folded form, was used to monitor the secondary structural change of the enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Quaternary Structural Changes of WT and Tryptophan-mutated Malic Enzymes during Urea Denaturation—According to our previous results, the intermediate state involves polymerization of the partially unfolded dimers and Mn2+ provides full protection up to 4 m urea for WT (11Chang H.C. Chou W.Y. Chang G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4663-4671Google Scholar). Interestingly, the intermediate form was not observed in W321 during the urea denaturation process, which was monitored by fluorescence (Fig. 3, C and G). These data are consistent with the involvement of interfacial region in the intermediate state.We then checked the substituted mutation effect on the quaternary structure with analytical ultracentrifugation. All tryptophan mutants and WT showed a major peak with similar sedimentation coefficient (9–10 S) in the presence or absence of Mn2+, except that a small amount of the mutant enzyme was dissociated to the dimeric form (Fig. 5). However, the results obtained were different when the recombinant enzymes were denatured by 4.5 m urea. Polymerization was found in W129 and W321 enzymes in the absence or presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 6, B, C, F, and G). The polymerized forms are quite heterogeneous. In the absence of Mn2+, W548 enzyme also showed polymerization (Fig. 6D). The polymerized forms are also complicated, but it appears to have some distinct polymeric species that are different from that observed for the other two mutants. When analyzed by the continuous distribution C(M) Lamm equation model of the SedFit program (19Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Google Scholar), the characteristic peaks at 20, 26, 33–35, 40–41, and 49–50 S correspond to species with molecular mass of ∼1500, 2100, 2900, 4000, and 5,500 kDa, respectively. However, when W548 was preincubated with Mn2+, the structure existed as a dimer instead of a polymer (Fig. 6H). These results clearly indicated that the replacement of Trp-548 at W129 and W321 leads to polymerization. We have demonstrated that a single replacement of Trp-548 destabilized the quaternary structure of the enzyme.Fig. 5Sedimentation velocity experiments of WT and mutant pigeon liver malic enzymes. The WT (A, E) and mutant pigeon liver malic enzymes (B and F, W129; C and G, W321; and D and H, W548) were examined for quaternary structure by the sedimentation velocity.

The enzymes without or with preincubation of 4 mm Mn2+ were mixed with 4.5 m of urea at 25 °C for 1 h and then examined for quaternary structural changes by the sedimentation velocity. The results of WT, W129, W321, and W548 without Mn2+ were shown in A, B, C, and D, respectively. The same enzyme preparation preincubated with Mn2+ was shown in E, F, G, and H, respectively.

The enzyme solution, even incubated with 4.5 m urea for 1 h, however, was visually transparent. Dynamic light scattering technique was employed to further characterize the polymerization phenomenon.The dimensions of the tetrameric malic enzyme are 11 × 11 × 5.5 nm determined by x-ray crystallography (2Xu Y. Bhargava G. Wu H. Loeber G. Tong L. Structure (Lond.). 1999; 7: 877-889Google Scholar) or 10.2 × 10.8 × 7 nm observed in electron microscopic analysis (23Nevaldine B.H. Bassel A.R. Hsu R.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 283-293Google Scholar). The ellipsoidal monomer of the enzyme has dimensions of 4.8 × 5.4 × 7 nm (23Nevaldine B.H. Bassel A.R. Hsu R.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 283-293Google Scholar). When examining by the dynamic light scattering technique, WT malic enzyme revealed monodispersed particle with size diameter of 9 nm, compatible with tetramer in solution. Incubating the enzyme with 4.5 m urea for 30 min produced particles of 6.3 nm in diameter, consistent with dissociation of the enzyme into dimers or monomers. Prolong incubation, however, will result in polymerization as manifested by the increasing of particle size upon incubation time. A similar phenomenon was observed for mutant malic enzyme. The particle size of W321, for example, was 4.6 nm when incubating with 4.5 m urea for 30 min. The particle size increased to 25.8 nm after 1 h. Prolonged incubation resulted in aggregation.The unfolding process of malic enzyme in urea solution, thus, is dissociation of tetramer to partially unfolded dimers and then monomers. The partially unfolded dimers or monomers are easily polymerized and finally aggregated. The signals detected in CD or fluorescence spectroscopy during urea denaturation thus could be partly due to the light scattering effect of the polymers. For this reason the unfolding data shown in Figs. 3 and 4 is only qualitatively discussed. No quantitative analysis of the unfolding thermodynamics was attempted.DISCUSSIONWe have constructed three tryptophan mutants of pigeon liver malic enzyme to assess the structural role of different domains of the enzyme. All mutants have similar CD spectra, kinetic parameters, and sedimentation coefficients with the WT (Fig. 2A, Table I, and Fig. 5, respectively). The overall tertiary and quaternary structures of the enzyme seem undisturbed by the mutation.With these mutants, we explored the contribution of individual tryptophanyl residue by monitoring the CD and fluorescence spectral changes during denaturation process. Only the W548 mutant gave identical results to the WT enzyme (Figs. 3 and 4). This suggests that the local environment of Trp-548 but not Trp-129 or Trp-321 is highly correlated to the observed quaternary structural change. The interface region shown in Figs. 1B and 7A clearly indicates that Trp-129 is buried and Trp-321 is far away from the interfacial region. On the other hand, the Trp-548 residue sticks out from the subunit and is located in a deep, hydrophobic pocket from the subunit of another dimer and thus involves in the tetramer interaction (Fig. 7A) (1Yang Z. Zhang H. Hung H.C. Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Yuan H.S. Chou W.Y. Chang G.G. Tong L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 332-341Google Scholar). The tetrameric pigeon malic enzyme has been demonstrated to dissociate into dimers and monomers at a lower pH (5Chang G.G. Huang T.M. Chang T.C. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 123-130Google Scholar, 6Huang T.M. Chang G.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12658-12664Google Scholar). Examination of the crystal structure of the enzyme shows the presence of a pair of histidyl residues, His-117 and His-202, in which His-117 is located in the binding pocket for Trp-548 (1Yang Z. Zhang H. Hung H.C. Kuo C.C. Tsai L.C. Yuan H.S. Chou W.Y. Chang G.G. Tong L. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 332-341Google Scholar). It is possible that protonation of these histidyl residues at a lower pH can affect the binding of the Trp-548 residue in the tetramer interface, which in turn, destabilized the tetramer interface. For this reason, substitution of Trp-548 to phenylalanine in W129 and W321 mutants may interfere the interaction with histidyl residues and thus induced some dissociation of malic enzyme as noted in Fig. 5. Furthermore, Trp-548 is adjacent to Trp-129 from domain A of another subunit. The distance between Trp-129(a) and Trp-548(d) is 15 Å (Fig. 7B). It suggests that in WT there is some degree of energy transfer between Trp-129 of subunit a and Trp-548 of subunit d (26Hammarstrom P. Persson M. Carlsson U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21765-21775Google Scholar, 27Beasty A.M. Hurle M.R. Manz J.T. Stackhouse T. Onuffer J.J. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2965-2974Google Scholar). The nearly coplanar orientation between Trp-129 and Trp-548 would optimize their mutual interactions (Fig. 7C). This could explain the sum of individual mutant's fluorescence is larger than WT, in which some quenching might have occurred between Trp-129 and Trp-548 (Fig. 2B). The same reason can be extended to explain the characteristic peak for the intermediate unfolding state detected by integrated fluorescence area, which is enhanced in W129 due to the lack of Trp-548 quenching (Fig. 3F).Fig. 7Distribution of tryptophanyl residues in pigeon liver malic enzyme.A, surface potential model of the enzyme.
