https://openalex.org/W2060645936,"We have demonstrated that immediate early genes can be differentially activated within the central nervous system. We examined the effects of tetanic stimulation in the hippocampus and of noxious sensory stimulation of the spinal cord on the expression of eight immediate early genes. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the dentate gyrus resulted in an increase in mRNA and protein for NGFI-A (also termed Zif/268, Egr-1, or Krox 24), and less consistently for jun-B mRNA. No increase was seen for c-fos, NGFI-B, c-jun, jun-D, SRF, or PC4 mRNAs. Blockade of the NMDA receptor prevented the induction of both LTP and NGFI-A mRNA in the dentate gyrus. However, commissural stimulation, which prevented the induction of LTP, resulted in bilateral activation of all the genes examined, including NGFI-A. No change was seen in animals trained in a water maze. These results suggest that no simple relationship exists between LTP, spatial learning, and immediate early gene induction. Stimulation of sensory fibers resulted in an increase in mRNA for NGFI-A, c-fos, SRF, NGFI-B, and c-jun in spinal cord neurons. Blockade of the NMDA receptor had no effect on immediate early gene induction in the spinal cord."

https://openalex.org/W1980968239,"Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) inhibits the growth factor and oncogene induction of transin/stromelysin, a secreted matrix-degrading metalloprotease. We demonstrate that a 10 bp element in the transin promoter is required for the TGF-beta 1 inhibitory effects and that this sequence is conserved in the promoter regions of several other TGF-beta 1-inhibited genes. The TGF-beta 1 inhibitory element (TIE) specifically binds a nuclear protein complex from TGF-beta 1-stimulated rat fibroblasts. Interestingly, this complex contained the c-fos proto-oncogene product, Fos, and induction of Fos expression was required for the inhibitory effect of TGF-beta 1 on transin gene expression. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 inhibition of gene expression is mediated by the binding of a Fos-containing protein complex to the TIE promoter sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1983075270,"EMT-6 murine mammary tumors were made resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP), carboplatin, cyclophosphamide (CTX), or thiotepa in vivo by treatment of tumor-bearing animals with the drug during a 6-month period. In spite of high levels of in vivo resistance, no significant resistance was observed when the cells from these tumors were exposed to the drugs in vitro. The pharmacokinetics of CDDP and CTX were altered in animals bearing the respective resistant tumors. The resistance of all tumor lines except for the EMT-6/thiotepa decreased during 3 to 6 months in vivo passage in the absence of drugs. These results indicate that very high levels of resistance to anticancer drugs can develop through mechanisms that are expressed only in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2047110468,"Protease nexin-II (PN-II) [amyloid beta-protein precursor (APP)] and the amyloid beta-protein are major constituents of neuritic plaques and cerebrovascular deposits in individuals with Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. Both the brain and the circulation have been implicated as sources of these molecules, although they have not been detected in blood. Human platelets have now been found to contain relatively large amounts of PN-II/APP. Platelet PN-II/APP was localized in platelet alpha-granules and was secreted upon platelet activation. Because PN-II/APP is a potent protease inhibitor and possesses growth factor activity, these results implicate PN-II/APP in wound repair. In certain disease states, alterations in platelet release and processing and clearance of PN-II/APP and its derived fragments could lead to pathological accumulation of these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2086705852,"A genomic clone encoding the Purkinje cell-specific L7 protein has been isolated and utilized to drive the expression of beta-galactosidase in mice. Three independent transgenic lines, germ line transformed with an L7-beta-galactosidase fusion gene, exhibit beta-galactosidase expression in both cerebellar Purkinje cells and retinal bipolar neurons. This distribution is the same as that previously determined for the L7 protein by immunohistochemistry. The transgenic murine lines can be used to obtain populations of marked Purkinje and bipolar neurons. Similar L7 promoter constructs can be used to express other foreign genes specifically in these two classes of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2119137218,"The endosomal compartment of polarized epithelial cells is a major crossroads for membrane traffic. Proteins entering this compartment from the cell surface are sorted for transport to one of several destinations: recycling to the original cell surface, targeting to lysosomes for degradation, or transcytosis to the opposite surface. The polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which is normally transcytosed from the basolateral to the apical surface, was used as a model to dissect the signals that mediate this sorting event. When exogenous receptor was expressed in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells, it was shown that phosphorylation of pIgR at the serine residue at position 664 is required for efficient transcytosis. Replacement of this serine with alanine generated a receptor that is transcytosed only slowly, and appears to be recycled. Conversely, substitution with aspartic acid (which mimics the negative charge of the phosphate group) results in rapid transcytosis. It was concluded that phosphorylation is the signal that directs the pIgR from the endosome into the transcytotic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1605302461,"The peptidoglycan-bound arabinogalactan of a virulent strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis was per-O-methylated, partially hydrolyzed with acid, and the resulting oligosaccharides reduced and O-pentadeute-rioethylated. The per-O-alkylated oligoglycosyl alditol fragments were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography and the structures of 43 of these constituents determined by 1H NMR and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The arabinogalactan was shown to consist of a galactan containing alternating 5-linked beta-D-galactofuranosyl (Galf) and 6-linked beta-D-Galf residues. The arabinan chains are attached to C-5 of some of the 6-linked Galf residues. The arabinan is comprised of at least three major structural domains. One is composed of linear 5-linked alpha-D-arabinofuranosyl (Araf) residues; a second consists of branched 3,5-linked alpha-D-Araf units substituted with 5-linked alpha-D-Araf residues at both branched positions. The non-reducing terminal region of the arabinan was characterized by a 3,5-linked alpha-D-Araf residue substituted at both branched positions with the disaccharide beta-D-Araf-(1----2)-alpha-D-Araf. 13C NMR of intact soluble arabinogalactan established the presence of both alpha- and beta-Araf residues in this domain. This non-reducing terminal motif apparently provides the structural basis of the dominant immunogenicity of arabinogalactan within mycobacteria. A rhamnosyl residue occupies the reducing terminus of the galactan core and may link the arabinogalactan to the peptidoglycan. Evidence is also presented for the presence of minor structural features involving terminal mannopyranosyl units. Models for most of the heteropolysaccharide are proposed which should increase our understanding of a molecule responsible for much of the immunogenicity, pathogenicity, and peculiar physical properties of the mycobacterial cell."
https://openalex.org/W1988015362,"Native human plasminogen has a radius of gyration of 39 angstroms. Upon occupation of a weak lysine binding site, the radius of gyration increases to 56 angstroms, an extremely large ligand-induced conformational change. There are no intermediate conformational states between the closed and open form. The conformational change is not accompanied by a change in secondary structure, hence the closed conformation is formed by interaction between domains that is abolished upon conversion to the open form. This reversible change in conformation, in which the shape of the protein changes from that best described by a prolate ellipsoid to a flexible structure best described by a Debye random coil, is physiologically relevant because a weak lysine binding site regulates the activation of plasminogen."

https://openalex.org/W2100725614,"Latent broad bean polyphenoloxidase was purified and shown to be activated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Further characterization of the enzyme was carried out in the presence and absence of SDS. Activation of the enzyme increased in a sigmoidal manner with increasing SDS concentrations up to a maximum of 1.75 mM. The presence of SDS eliminated a low pH optimum induced by acid shocking. Increased thermolability of the enzyme was observed in the presence of SDS as well as an increased binding of [14C]dihydroxy-phenylalanine. Size exclusion chromatography on high performance liquid chromatography showed that the size and apparent molecular mass of the enzyme were slightly altered in the presence (48 kDa) versus absence (47 kDa) of SDS. Although the estimations were larger than those obtained by size exclusion techniques, no large differences in molecular weight were observed after sedimentation equilibrium of the enzyme in the presence (53.9 kDa) and absence (52.3 kDa) of SDS. Relative electrophoretic mobility and intrinsic fluorescence of tyrosine and tryptophan residues increased in a complex fashion as the SDS concentration was increased. Plateau regions in these latter experiments corresponded to concentrations of SDS needed for activation. The ability of SDS to activate the enzyme alters both its enzymatic and physical characteristics and suggests that a limited conformational change, due to binding of small amounts of SDS, may induce or initiate the activation of latent enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1544929992,"We have previously characterized a hormonally regulated soluble form of phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the cultured renal mesangial cell which is similar and possibly identical to the major form in rat kidney. In an attempt to further characterize the mechanisms of regulation of this enzyme we have used epidermal growth factor (EGF), which does not activate polyphosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C in these cells. EGF-enhanced PLA2 activity as assayed by the ability of the soluble extracts of cells to cleave arachidonic acid from the sn-2 position of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. This represents a direct demonstration of EGF-induced PLA2 activation which is preserved in a cell-free extract. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), as well as 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, also enhanced PLA2 activity. By contrast, the calcium ionophore A23187 had no effect on extract PLA2 activity. The EGF- and PMA-induced enhanced activity was recovered following fractionation by Mono-Q anion exchange chromatography. The peak of activity comigrated for both agonists, suggesting that both EGF and PMA stimulated the same form of the enzyme. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by pretreatment with PMA resulted in loss of the PMA-induced, but not the EGF-induced, enhancement in PLA2 activity. 8-Bromo-cAMP had no effect upon the PLA2 activity, and did not modulate the EGF effect. Pertussis toxin induced G protein ADP-ribosylation but had no effect upon PLA2 activity, and did not alter the EGF effect. In summary, EGF results in a stable modification of PLA2 activity in glomerular mesangial cells. This enhanced activity is independent of polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis, insensitive to protein kinase C down-regulation, and is not affected by cAMP or pertussis toxin pretreatment of the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1509810344,"We have examined the effects of interleukin 2 (IL-2) treatment either alone or in combination with interferon (IFN) gamma or beta on the expression of several activation associated genes (e.g. tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), IFN-inducible 10-kDa protein (IP-10] in murine peritoneal macrophages. IL-2 alone did not induce the expression of either gene while IFN gamma or IFN beta had a modest inductive effect on IP-10 but no effect on TNF alpha expression. When either form of IFN was used in combination with IL-2 there was a marked synergistic induction of both mRNAs. IFN gamma and IL-2 were maximally effective when both agents were added simultaneously, and induced mRNA expression declined over a 24-h period in cells pretreated with IFN gamma prior to addition of IL-2. Expression of both genes following combination lymphokine treatment was mediated by increased transcriptional activity. The responses to all three lymphokines were dose dependent; the concentration requirement for IL-2 indicated interaction with an intermediate or low affinity receptor. The expression of both monokine genes was transient and was comparable although not identical to that seen in cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. IFN gamma and IL-2 could synergize to stimulate the expression of either TNF alpha or IP-10 mRNA using sequential non-overlapping treatment periods regardless of the order in which the two stimuli were applied to the cells. The effect of either agent alone induced a transient (1-5 h) responsive state with respect to subsequent stimulation with the second agent. Expression of both monokine genes in response to IFN gamma/IL-2 treatment was independent of protein synthesis as cycloheximide did not inhibit the accumulation of specific mRNA. Interestingly, the combination of IL-2 and cycloheximide was as effective as IFN gamma and IL-2 together. In concert, these results indicate that both IFN and IL-2 generate independent intracellular signals which alone are incapable of inductive effect but which are potent activators of inflammatory gene expression when coincidentally expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1525397595,"We have reported previously that prolonged incubation of adipocytes with (-)-N6-phenylisopropyl adenosine (PIA) (an A1 adenosine receptor agonist) down-regulates A1 adenosine receptors. There was a concomitant decrease in pertussis toxin catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of a 41-kDa peptide thought to be the alpha-subunit of Gi. To determine whether this represents true down-regulation of the G-protein, and if so which of the three known forms of Gi are down-regulated, we have used antipeptide antisera specific for Gi alpha-subunits. Serum SG1 recognizes alpha i1 and -2, I1C recognizes only alpha i1, and I3B recognizes alpha i3. Rat adipocytes were maintained in primary culture for up to 7 days with 0-1000 nM PIA. Crude membrane preparations were analyzed by Western blots. There was almost complete loss of alpha i1 and -3, and about 50% loss of alpha i2 from PIA-treated cells. The loss of each alpha i was detectable after 24 h with 300 nM PIA and maximal by 4 days. After 4 days, down-regulation was detectable with 3 nM and maximal with 100 nM PIA. Antiserum BN2 demonstrated approximately 50% loss of G-protein beta-subunits in cells treated with 300 nM PIA for 4 days. When cells were incubated for 4 days with 300 nM PIA and then washed to remove PIA, alpha i1, -2, and -3 and beta-subunits returned to control levels within 5 days. Antiserum CS1 detected normal amounts of both the 43- and 47-kDa forms of Gs alpha in PIA-treated cells. We conclude that Gi alpha-subunits are down-regulated along with the adenosine receptor in rat adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1540944097,"The biosynthesis of deoxyhypusine (N-(4-aminobutyl)lysine) occurs by the transfer of the 4-aminobutyl moiety of spermidine to a specific lysine residue in a precursor of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4D (eIF-4D). Deoxyhypusine synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction, was purified approximately 700-fold from rat testis. The Km values for the substrates, spermidine, the eIF-4-D precursor protein, and NAD+, were estimated as approximately 1, 0.08, and 30 microM, respectively. After incubation of partially purified enzyme with [1,8-3H]spermidine, NAD+, and the eIF-4D precursor, equal amounts of radioactivity were found in free 1,3-diaminopropane and in protein-bound deoxyhypusine. However, when the protein substrate (eIF-4D precursor) was omitted, radioactivity was found in 1,3-diaminopropane and in delta 1-pyrroline in nearly equal quantities, providing evidence that the cleavage of spermidine occurs, albeit at a slower rate, in the absence of the eIF-4D precursor. That NAD+, which is required for this reaction, functions as the hydrogen acceptor was demonstrated by the fact that radioactivity from spermidine labeled with 3H at position 5 is found in NADH as well as in delta 1-pyrroline. Transfer of this hydrogen from spermidine to the re face of the nicotinamide ring of NAD+, as determined by the use of dehydrogenases of known stereospecificity, defines the first step of deoxyhypusine synthesis as a pro-R, or A, stereospecific dehydrogenation. Based on these findings, an enzyme mechanism involving imine intermediate formation is proposed."

The use of 500-MHz 1H NMR in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional modes as well as nuclear Overhauser effect experiments were employed. To assist in the structural assignments the purified oligosaccharides were also degraded by chemical and enzymatic procedures to smaller fragments. The largest of the three original oligosaccharides is a triantennary partially O-acetylated decasaccharide in which the largest antenna terminates in a lacto-N-neotetraose unit. The smaller oligosaccharides (heptasaccharide and octasaccharide) except for terminal glycose deletions from the longest antenna are structural replicas of the larger."

The site is much older than the localities of previously known Egyptian early Tertiary primates. These finds include a crushed cranium that is the oldest skull found to date of a higher primate. This skull shows four characteristics of higher primates: a catarrhine dental formula, an ectotympanic at the rim of the auditory bulla, a fused frontal bone, and postorbital closure. Details of tooth structure (premolars and molars) and a possibly unfused mandibular symphysis resemble these parts in certain Eocene prosimians."
https://openalex.org/W1981836418,"In Hermissenda crassicornis conditioned to associate light and rotation, type B photoreceptor neurons exhibit pairing-specific decreases in the potassium currents IA and IK-Ca, which account for many of the behavioral changes elicited by associative conditioning. To determine which proteins are involved in storage of this memory, high-performance liquid chromatography was used to examine proteins from Hermissenda eyes. Conditioning-specific changes in four phosphoproteins were observed 24 hours after conditioning. One of these proteins, cp20, was purified to apparent homogeneity and found to be a G protein. When injected back into Hermissenda type B cells, cp20 reduced IK and IK-Ca in a manner indistinguishable from the reduction caused by conditioning, suggesting that this protein may play a crucial role in memory acquisition or retention."
https://openalex.org/W1511689349,"Although recent studies suggest involvement of glutathione transferase (GST) of blood vessels in vasodilation by nitroglycerin, GST forms in blood vessels remain to be studied. In this study, three GST forms (pI values 8.3, 6.6, and 4.8) were purified from human aorta and four (pI values 6.0, 5.6, 5.3, and 4.6) from the heart by affinity chromatography followed by chromatofocusing. The major form of both aorta (pI 4.8) and heart (pI 4.6) was identified as GST-pi, and the other five forms were immunologically related to GST-mu, suggesting that the five belong to the Mu class. Among nine human GST forms, including three in the Alpha class purified from the liver, GST-mu, aorta pI 8.3 form, and GST-I (a form of the Alpha class, corresponding to GST-epsilon (B1B1)) showed high activities toward nitroglycerin, 1.08, 0.85, and 0.78 units/mg protein, respectively. GST-pi did not exhibit the activity. The Km values of the aorta form (pI 8.3) for glutathione (GSH) and nitroglycerin were calculated as 0.12 and 1.1 mM, respectively. The Km values of GST-mu and GST-I for GSH were 0.29 and 0.09 mM, and those for nitroglycerin were 2.5 and 0.3 mM, respectively. The activity of the pI 8.3 form as well as GST-mu toward nitroglycerin was inhibited by bromosulfophthalein, which is known to inhibit the relaxation of rabbit aorta induced by nitroglycerin, at the lower concentration (IC50, 2 microM) than was GST-I (IC50, 32 microM). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed that five forms in the Mu class are homo- or heterodimers of five different subunits named M1 (pI 7.0/Mr 27,000), M2 (6.6/27,000), M3 (6.0/27,000), N1 (6.5/26,500), and N2 (5.9/26,500). The subunit structures of the five forms are as follows: pI 8.3 form, M1M2; 6.6 form, M2N1; 6.0 form, M3M3; 5.6 form, M3N2; and 5.3 form, N2N2. M3 and N2 seem to correspond to the subunits of GST-mu, and -4 (Board, P. G., Suzuki, T., and Shaw, D. C. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 953, 214-217), respectively. These subunits except N1 are different from each other at two or three positions in the first 20 residues of N-terminal amino acid sequence. These results indicate the presence of five different subunits in the human Mu class and also suggest that GST-M1M2 and -M2N1 found in the aorta are involved in the expression of the pharmacologic effect of nitroglycerin."
https://openalex.org/W1572981633,"Posttranslational glycosaminoglycan attachment to decorin, a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan, was studied by expression of a wild-type decorin cDNA and several mutagenized forms in two types of mammalian cells. Transfection of the wild-type cDNA resulted in the synthesis of an authentic chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan similar to the decorin molecule synthesized by cultured human fibroblasts. Conversion of the serine residue that serves as the attachment site for the sole glycosaminoglycan chain in decorin to a threonine residue greatly reduced the efficiency of the glycosaminoglycan substitution. Less than 10% of the threonine-mutated core protein acquired a glycosaminoglycan chain, whereas most of the core protein was secreted without such substitution. Expression of cDNA in which an alanine residue had been introduced into the substituted serine position resulted in the secretion of core protein with no detectable glycosaminoglycan. Conversion to alanine of either one of the glycine residues that are adjacent to the substituted serine yielded the proteoglycan form of decorin. These results show that the xylosyltransferase responsible for the initiation of the glycosaminoglycan chain on the core protein can use a threonine residue for this substitution instead of a serine residue, but that such substitution is only partial, creating a part-time proteoglycan. Moreover, variations are possible in the sequence context of a glycosaminoglycan-substituted serine residue without loss of glycosaminoglycan substitution. The conformation of the substitution site may therefore be important for xylosyltransferase recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1502565639,"Numerous hormones activate cells through receptor-regulated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides resulting in elevated cellular diacylglycerol (DAG), an activator of protein kinase C (PKC). Our previous studies showed that thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) treatment of GH3 cells stimulated a rapid (less than 10 s) but transient (less than 60 s) association of cytosolic PKC with the membrane. In this study, we investigated the roles of hormone-stimulated Ca2+ and DAG levels in initiating and terminating the membrane association of PKC. The initial effects of TRH were not mimicked by elevating CA2+ levels, however, inhibiting TRH-stimulated Ca2+ increases blocked hormone-stimulated PKC translocation. Hence, the TRH stimulation of both Ca2+ and DAG levels were essential for the initial PKC translocation. The termination of PKC membrane association could not be attributed to proteolysis of PKC nor to limiting Ca2+ levels. Treatment of cells with phorbol diesters potentiated and prolonged the effects of TRH on PKC translocation, suggesting that DAG levels limited the membrane association of PKC. Since TRH stimulated a sustained increase in DAG levels, DAG composition was analyzed. There was a marked shift in DAG from tetraenoic (at 15 s) to more saturated DAGs at longer times. In addition, increases in plasma membrane DAG in response to TRH were transient rather than sustained. We propose that the TRH stimulation of PKC translocation is short-lived due to the metabolism of plasma membrane DAGs which are effective in promoting PKC activation. In contrast, DAGs which accumulate in intracellular membranes during the sustained phase of TRH treatment appear to be ineffective as activators of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1519134544,"Glycosaminoglycan was isolated from the body wall of sea cucumber Stichopus japonicus by a method consisting of enzymatic digestion, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography. One gram of sea cucumber glycosaminoglycan was composed of 2.50 mmol of sulfate, 0.47 mmol of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), 0.53 mmol of glucuronic acid (GlcA), 1.73 mmol of fucose, and a small amount of peptide. When mildly hydrolyzed with 0.1 N H2SO4, this glycosaminoglycan released two products, one consisting of fucose plus sulfate and the other of fucose only. Partially hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycan thus obtained was composed of sulfate, GalNAc, GlcA, and fucose at a molar ratio of 3:2:2:1. Partially hydrolyzed glycosaminoglycan was easily digested with chondroitinase AC II. In ion-exchange chromatography, the digest exhibited four sharp peaks whose retention times agreed with those of unsaturated 0-(delta Di-0S), mono-(delta Di-4S and delta Di-6S), and di-(delta Di-SE) sulfated disaccharide, respectively. The disaccharide unit of sea cucumber glycosaminoglycan was composed of 22.4% chondroitin sulfate E, 11.2% chondroitin, 10.4% chondroitin 4-sulfate, and 56.0% chondroitin 6-sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1587897574,"The native pertussis toxin sensitive GTP-binding proteins (Gi proteins) were individually resolved, and their guanine nucleotide binding and release properties were studied. Gi2 and Gi3, the two major GTP-binding proteins of human erythrocytes, were purified to apparent homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography. Gi1 was purified from bovine brain. The three proteins bound 0.6-0.85 mol of guanosine 5'-O-(thio-triphosphate (GTP gamma S)/mol of protein with similar affinities (KD(app) = 50-100 nM). The rate of [35S]GTP gamma S binding to Gi2 was 5-8-fold faster than to Gi1 or Gi3 at 2 mm Mg2+. There were no observable differences in the binding characteristics between bovine brain Gi1 and human erythrocyte Gi3. At 50 mM Mg2+, all three Gi proteins exhibited fast binding, although Gi1 and Gi3 were marginally slower than Gi2. All three Gi proteins exhibited different rates of [32P]GDP release at 2 mM Mg2+. GDP release from Gi2 was severalfold faster than that from Gi1 or Gi3. GDP release rates from Gi1 and Gi3 were similar, although Gi3 was somewhat (60-80%) faster than Gi1. These data indicate that rates of GDP release and GTP binding may be independently regulated for these three proteins and that the relative proportions of Gi2/Gi1 or Gi2/Gi3 will be a crucial factor in determining the kinetics of signal transduction through Gi-coupled effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1570337253,"Addition of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to many cell types activates phospholipase C resulting in increased levels of diacylglycerol and intracellular Ca2+ which may lead to activation of protein kinase C. EGF treatment of cells can also lead to phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at threonine 654 (a protein kinase C phosphorylation site) which appears to attenuate some aspects of receptor signaling. Thus, a feedback loop involving the EGF receptor, phospholipase C, and protein kinase C may regulate EGF receptor function. In this report, the role of phosphorylation of threonine 654 of the EGF receptor in regulation of EGF-stimulated activation of phospholipase C was investigated. NIH-3T3 cells expressing the normal human EGF receptor or expressing EGF receptor in which an alanine residue had been substituted at residue 654 of the receptor were used. Addition of EGF to cells expressing wild-type receptor induced a rapid, but transient, increase in phosphorylation of threonine 654. EGF addition also caused the rapid accumulation of inositol phosphates in these cells. EGF-stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphates was significantly higher in cells expressing Ala-654 receptors compared to control cells. Treatment of cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which stimulated phosphorylation of threonine 654 to a greater degree than EGF, completely inhibited EGF-dependent inositol phosphate accumulation in cells expressing wild-type receptor, but caused only a 20-30% inhibition in Ala-654 expressing cells. EGF stimulated phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma on serine and tyrosine residues in cells expressing wild-type of Ala-654 receptors. However, TPA treatment of cells inhibited EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma only in cells expressing wild-type receptors. Similarly, TPA inhibited tyrosine-specific autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation of several other proteins in wild-type receptor cells, but not in Ala-654 cells. TPA treatment abolished high affinity binding of EGF to cells expressing wild-type receptors, while decreasing the number of high affinity binding sites 20-30% in Ala-654 cells. These data suggest that phosphorylation of threonine 654 can regulate early events in EGF receptor signal transduction such as phosphoinositide turnover, probably through a feedback mechanism involving protein kinase C. Subsequent dephosphorylation of threonine 654 could reactivate the EGF receptor for participation in later signaling events."
https://openalex.org/W1564397880,"We have developed a retroviral-vector system for the transfer and expression of a cloned blood clotting factor VIII cDNA. Since inclusion of the complete cDNA into existing vectors is precluded by its large size, we deleted most codons for the B-domain, which is also excised during in vivo maturation of factor VIII. When inserted into the retroviral vector M5-neoR (Laker, C., Stocking, C., Bergholtz, V., Hess, N., DeLamarter, J. F., and Ostertag, W. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Upon infection of murine fibroblast cell lines, clones containing only a single copy of the integrated vector-provirus secreted up to 125 milliunits of factor VIII antigen/10(6) cells/day. Equivalent amounts were found in a factor VIII activity assay, which signifies that the factor VIII protein secreted by the infected fibroblasts is fully functional. Primary human skin fibroblasts infected with the vector virus secreted up to 30 milliunits/10(6) cells/day."

By searching for factors that may control proliferation, a zinc finger gene (225) was identified that was constitutively expressed in all HTLV-I- or HTLV-II-transformed cell lines examined, whereas in normal T cells it was only transiently expressed after mitogenic stimulation. The 225 gene was also constitutively expressed in two HTLV-I-transformed helper T cell clones, but not in the parental cell lines. Thus this putative cellular transcriptional factor, which was abnormally expressed in retrovirus-infected cells, may have a role in transformation."

These studies revealed that in the absence of Mg2+ oncomodulin binds two Ca2+ with KCa = 2.2 x 10(7) and 1.7 x 10(6) M-1, respectively. In the absence of Ca2+ the protein binds only one Mg2+ with KMg = 4.0 x 10(3) M-1.Mg2+ antagonizes Ca2+ binding at the high affinity site according to the rule of direct competition. Ca2+ binding to the low affinity site is only slightly affected by Mg2+, so that in the presence of 2-3 mM Mg2+ the two sites have apparently an equal affinity for Ca2+. Microcalorimetry showed that, in spite of the different affinities of the two Ca2(+)-binding sites, delta H0 for the binding of each Ca2+ is identical and exothermic for -18.9 kJ/site. It follows that the entropy gain upon binding of Ca2+ is +77.1 J K-1 site-1 for the high affinity Ca2(+)-Mg2+ site and +56.0 J K-1 site-1 for the low affinity Ca2(+)-specific site. Mg2+ binding is endothermic for +13 kJ/site with an entropy change of +111 J K-1 site-1. The thermodynamic characteristics of the Ca2(+)-Mg2+ site resemble most those of site II (the so-called EF domain) of toad alpha-parvalbumin. The characteristics of Ca2+ binding to the specific site (likely the CD domain) are different from those of the Ca2+ specific sites in troponin C and in calmodulin and suggest that in oncomodulin hydrophobic forces do not play a predominant role in the binding process at the specific site."
https://openalex.org/W2108456099,"Hepatic lipase (HL) is a member of the lipoprotein lipase/pancreatic lipase gene family and is believed to function in processing of intermediate and high density lipoproteins. As a lipase, HL is presumed to have a lipid interfacial binding domain, distinct from the esterase catalytic site, orienting the enzyme at aqueous-lipid interfaces and resulting in activation of esterase activity. However, the structural domains responsible for these separate functions have not been identified. Amino acid sequence homology to serine proteases, thioesterases and other lipases, identified Ser147 of rat HL as part of a highly conserved element in an esterase gene family. In order to better define the function of this domain in HL, site-directed mutagenesis was utilized to produce mutant cDNAs with amino acid substitutions for Ser147, Ser133, or Ser228. Following injection of Xenopus oocytes with SP6 transcripts for normal or mutant HL, media from the oocytes were assayed for lipolytic activity and immunoprecipitable HL protein. Mutations of Ser133 and Ser228 produced no decrease in activity whereas the mutant protein in which Ser147 was replaced with glycine had little, if any activity against emulsified triolein substrates. Replacing HL Ser147 with glycine also resulted in a protein with little or no measurable activity for tributyrin, a substrate which does not provide a lipid interface. These results suggest that Ser147 in rat HL is either located at the catalytic site or is required for maintaining the structural integrity of the catalytic site."
https://openalex.org/W2033395786,"Extracellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) serves multiple roles in Dictyostelium development, acting as a chemoattractant, a cell-cell signaling molecule, and an inducer of differentiation. The Dictyostelium G-protein alpha subunit G alpha 2 appears to be the major transducer linking the surface cAMP receptor to these intracellular responses. On stimulation of cells with cAMP, G alpha 2 is phosphorylated on one or more serine residues, resulting in an alteration of its electrophoretic mobility. Phosphorylation of G alpha 2 is triggered by increased occupancy of the surface cAMP receptor and is rapid and transient, coinciding with the time course of activation of physiological responses."
https://openalex.org/W1546299836,"Previous studies identified synapsin I as a potential substrate for a newly discovered growth factor-sensitive, proline-directed protein kinase originally isolated from rat pheochromocytoma. The present study describes the site-specific phosphorylation of synapsin I by highly purified preparations of proline-directed protein kinase. The incorporation of [32P]phosphate into bovine brain synapsin I was dependent upon both the amount of kinase present and the time of incubation. The maximum stoichiometry of phosphorylation approached 1 mol of phosphate/mol of synapsin I protein. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, [32P]phosphate was found to be incorporated into both synapsin Ia and Ib. Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that serine residues were phosphorylated exclusively. Digestion of phosphorylated synapsin I with trypsin followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) phosphopeptide analysis indicated that the tryptic peptide containing the major phosphorylation site eluted as a single peak at approximately 17% acetonitrile. The primary structure of this phosphopeptide, determined by gas-phase sequencing, was found to be Gln-Ser-Arg-Pro-Val-Ala-Gly-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ala-Pro-Pro-Ala-Thr-Arg-Pro-Pro- Ala-Ser-Pro-Ser-Pro-Gln-Arg. Sequential Edman degradation of this HPLC-purified tryptic phosphopeptide revealed that serine 20 of this peptide was the major phosphorylated residue. This phosphoacceptor site is immediately flanked by a carboxyl-terminal proline residue, an observation that further verifies the proline-directed nature of this protein kinase. The tryptic phosphopeptide corresponds exactly to a sequence in the collagenase-sensitive, proline-rich tail region of bovine synapsin I. This novel phosphorylation site is close to but distinct from phosphorylation sites 2 and 3, which are known to be phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and are considered to be of regulatory importance."
https://openalex.org/W1600916699,"The simian ralA cDNA was inserted in a ptac expression vector, and high amounts of soluble ral protein were expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified p24ral contains 1 mol of bound nucleotide/mol of protein that can be exchanged against external nucleotide. The ral protein exchanges GDP with a t 1/2 of 90 min at 37 degrees C in the presence of Mg2+, and has a low GTPase activity (0.07 min-1 at 37 degrees C). We have also studied its affinity for various guanine nucleotides and analogs. NMR measurements show that the three-dimensional environment around the nucleotide is similar in p21ras and p24ral. In addition to these studies on the wild-type ral protein, we used in vitro mutagenesis to introduce substitutions corresponding to the Val12, Val12 + Thr59, and Leu61 substitutions of p21ras. These mutant ral proteins display altered nucleotide exchange kinetics and GTPase activities, however, the effects of the substitutions are less pronounced than in the ras proteins. p24ralVal12 + Thr59 autophosphorylates on the substituted Thr, as a side reaction of the GTP hydrolysis, but the rate is much lower than those of the Thr59 mutants of p21ras. These results show that ras and ral proteins have similar structures and biochemical properties. Significant differences are found, however, in the contribution of the Mg2+ ion to GDP binding, in the rate of the GTPase reaction and in the sensitivity of these two proteins to substitutions around the phosphate-binding site, suggesting that the various small G-proteins of the ras family perform different functions."
https://openalex.org/W1568955326,"Phospholipid acyl turnover was assessed in mouse peritoneal exudate cells which consisted primarily of macrophages. The cells were incubated for up to 5 h in media containing 40% H218O, and uptake of 18O into ester carbonyls of phospholipids was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of hydrogenated methyl esters. The uptake was highest in choline phospholipids and phosphatidylinositol, less in ethanolamine phospholipids, and much less in phosphatidylserine. Acyl groups at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of diacyl glycerophospholipids, including arachidonic and other long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, acquired 18O at about the same rate. Acyl groups of alkylacyl glycerophosphocholine exhibited lower rates of 18O uptake, and acyl groups of ethanolamine plasmalogens (alkenylacyl glycerophosphoethanolamines) acquired only minimal amounts of 18O within 5 h, indicating a low average acyl turnover via free fatty acids. Pulse experiments with exogenous 3H-labeled arachidonic acid supported the concept that acylation of alkenyl glycerophosphoethanolamine occurs by acyl transfer from other phospholipids rather than via free fatty acids and acyl-CoA. The 18O content of intracellular free fatty acids increased gradually over a 5-h period, whereas in extracellular free fatty acids it reached maximal 18O levels within the first hour. Arachidonate and other long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids were found to participate readily in deacylation-reacylation reactions but were present only in trace amounts in the free fatty acid pools inside and outside the cells. We conclude that acyl turnover of macrophage phospholipids through hydrolysis and reacylation is rapid but tightly controlled so that appreciable concentrations of free arachidonic acid do not occur."

https://openalex.org/W1554109286,"Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of Bacillus anthracis adenylyl cyclase revealed sequences with homology to consensus sequences for A- and B-type ATP binding domains found in many ATP binding proteins. Based on the analysis of nucleotide binding proteins, a conserved basic amino acid residue in the A-type consensus sequence and a conserved acidic amino acid residue in the B-type consensus sequence have been implicated in the binding of ATP. The putative ATP binding sequences in the B. anthracis adenylyl cyclase possess analogous lysine residues at positions 346 and 353 within two A-type consensus sequences and a glutamate residue at position 436 within a B-type consensus sequence. The two A-type consensus sequences overlap each other and have the opposite orientation. To determine whether Lys-346, Lys-353, or Glu-436 of the B. anthracis adenylyl cyclase are crucial for enzyme activity, Lys-346 and Lys-353 were replaced with methionine and Glu-436 with glutamine by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, Lys-346 was also replaced with arginine. The genes encoding the wild type and mutant adenylyl cyclases were placed under the control of the lac promoter for expression in Escherichia coli, and extracts were assayed for adenylyl cyclase activity. In all cases, a 90-kDa polypeptide corresponding to the catalytic subunit of the enzyme was detected in E. coli extracts by rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified B. anthracis adenylyl cyclase. The proteins with the Lys-346 to methionine or arginine mutations exhibited no adenylyl cyclase activity, indicating that Lys-346 in the A-type ATP binding consensus sequence plays a critical role for enzyme catalysis. Furthermore, the enzyme with the Lys-353 to methionine mutation was also inactive, suggesting that Lys-353 may also directly contribute to enzyme catalysis. In contrast, the protein with the Glu-436 to glutamine mutation retained 75% of enzyme activity, suggesting that Glu-436 in the B-type ATP binding consensus sequence may not be directly involved in enzyme catalysis. It is concluded that Lys-346 and Lys-353 in B. anthracis adenylyl cyclase may interact directly with ATP and contribute to the binding of the nucleotide to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1544937449,"Human lysozyme is made up of 130 amino acid residues and has four disulfide bonds at Cys6-Cys128, Cys30-Cys116, Cys65-Cys81, and Cys77-Cys95. Our previous results using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretion system indicate that the individual disulfide bonds of human lysozyme have different functions in the correct in vivo folding and enzymatic activity of the protein (Taniyama, Y., Yamamoto, Y., Nakao, M., Kikuchi, M., and Ikehara, M. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 152, 962-967). In this paper, we report the results of experiments that were focused on the roles of Cys65 and Cys81 in the folding of human lysozyme protein in yeast. A mutant protein (C81A), in which Cys81 was replaced with Ala, had almost the same enzymatic activity and conformation as those of the native enzyme. On the other hand, another mutant (C65A), in which Cys65 was replaced with Ala, was not found to fold correctly. These results indicate that Cys81 is not a requisite for both correct folding and activity, whereas Cys65 is indispensable. The mutant protein C81A is seen to contain a new, non-native disulfide bond at Cys65-Cys77. The possible occurrence of disulfide bond interchange during our mapping experiments cannot be ruled out by the experimental techniques presently available, but characterization of other mutant proteins and computer analysis suggest that the intramolecular exchange of disulfide bonds is present in the folding pathway of human lysozyme in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1592672684,"The role of extracellular ethanolamine in phospholipid synthesis was examined in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Serine and ethanolamine were both readily accumulated by these cells and incorporated into phospholipid. Exposing cells to extracellular ethanolamine for 4-6 weeks had no effect on cell growth, yet increased the phosphatidylethanolamine content of these cells by 31% as compared to control cells. The intracellular content of ethanolamine was measured by high performance liquid chromatography, and results showed that the ethanolamine-treated cells contained a significantly greater amount of free ethanolamine compared to control cells (0.62 +/- 0.07 nmol/mg of protein versus 0.27 +/- 0.05 nmol/mg of protein, respectively). Ethanolamine-treated cells also had decreased accumulation and incorporation into lipid of [3H]ethanolamine throughout a 48-h incubation and increased K'm and V'max parameters of ethanolamine transport as compared to control cells. Studies were also done to examine the effect of ethanolamine on the generation of free ethanolamine from phosphatidylserine. In pulse-chase experiments with [3H]serine, a physiological concentration of ethanolamine (25 microM) decreased the amount of 3H-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine produced from 3H-labeled phosphatidylserine by 12 h as compared to the amount of 3H-labeled phosphatidyl-ethanolamine produced in the absence of ethanolamine in the chase incubation. Furthermore, ethanolamine-treated cells accumulated 20% less labeled ethanolamine in the aqueous pool from [3H]serine after 24 h of incubation than did control cells. These results can be explained by isotope dilution with the ethanolamine pool that accumulates in these cells with time when exposed to media supplemented with a physiological concentration of ethanolamine and by an effect of ethanolamine on ethanolamine generation from phosphatidylserine. The results show that an extracellular source of ethanolamine significantly influences the phospholipid metabolism of cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1493364340,"To investigate the biogenesis of the yeast vacuole, we have sought novel marker proteins localized to the vacuolar membrane. Glycoproteins were prepared from vacuolar membrane vesicles by concanavalin A-Sepharose column chromatography and used to raise monoclonal antibodies. The antibodies obtained recognize several vacuolar proteins that have N-linked oligosaccharide chains. A set of the antibodies reacts with a vacuolar glycoprotein with a major molecular species of 72 kDa (vgp72), which appears to associate peripherally with the vacuolar membrane. The biosynthesis of vgp72 has been examined in detail by pulse-chase experiments and by analyses using various secretory mutants (sec18, sec7, and sec1) and a vacuolar protease mutant (pep4). vgp72 first appears in the endoplasmic reticulum as a 74-kDa species and is quickly modified in the Golgi apparatus to two distinct species: a 79-kDa form, and a heterogeneously glycosylated form (90-150 kDa). Subsequently, both species are proteolytically processed in the vacuole giving rise to a 72-kDa species as well as heavily glycosylated form. Thus, the biogenesis of vgp72 utilizes the early part of the secretory pathway as is the case of vacuolar soluble enzymes. A unique feature is that two species that are different in the extent of glycosylation appear to follow the same destination to the vacuolar membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1565665448,"5'-Deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAase) was purified to homogeneity (10,000-fold) from bovine liver with a recovery of 12%. The pure protein shows a molecular weight of about 98,000 +/- 3,000 and is composed of three apparently identical subunits. Several physicochemical features have been investigated including hydrodynamic properties, amino acid composition, and secondary structure. In particular, the CD spectrum of the protein indicates a very low alpha-helical content and a large percent of beta-structure and random coil. The pure protein was used to raise specific rabbit antisera but, because of the scarce antigenic properties of the native enzyme, different chemically modified forms were prepared and employed as immunogens. Among the antibodies obtained, those to keyhole limpet hemocyanin-MTAase recognize both the native and the denatured enzyme and are also active against the human protein. Therefore, they were employed as a tool to investigate the occurrence of inactive forms of MTAase in two human malignant cell lines lacking this enzymatic activity. The results obtained with K562 and Jurkat cells indicate that the protein is absent in these phosphorylase-deficient cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W1494297561,"The covalent modification of proteins by metabolites of arachidonic acid (AA) was investigated in human platelets. Following incubation of washed human platelets with radiolabeled AA, ethanol precipitation of the proteins, and lipid extraction by organic solvents, a small fraction of the radioactivity added (0.3%) was tightly bound to the protein pellet. A dozen labeled protein bands were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Exhaustive hydrolysis of platelet proteins by proteases released an amphipathic radiolabeled material which had a chromatographic behavior similar to that of a known peptidolipid, leukotriene C4. These findings suggest a covalent nature for the observed binding. This binding was specific for AA since palmitate, myristate, or linoleate did not bind to a significant extent. It involved products of both cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways: it was indeed inhibited to a greater extent by eicosatetraynoic acid than by indomethacin. The protein-associated radioactivity was increased by the thromboxane synthase inhibitor dazoxiben. Indomethacin completely abolished this increase in binding, which could not be reproduced by exogenous prostaglandin (PG) E2, F2 alpha, or D2, and might thus involve PGG2 and/or PGH2. Diamide, an agent known to inhibit the reduction of 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid in platelets, produced an increase of the covalent binding, which was abolished by eicosatetraynoic acid but not by indomethacin: this suggests that the lipoxygenase product bound was 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid or a by-product. Dazoxiben and diamide produced distinct patterns of protein labeling after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. One labeled band had a Mr of 70,000 as the PGH synthase monomer. Addition of AA at 17 microM enhanced the labeling of this band, while 100 microM was inhibitory. Labeling of this band was also induced by thrombin in prelabeled platelets. Two monoclonal antibodies against PGH synthase caused immune precipitation of a 70-kDa labeled protein in homogenates of [3H]AA-labeled platelets. PGH synthase, purified from ram seminal vesicles, was covalently modified after incubation with [3H]AA: this labeling was almost completely abolished by indomethacin. As much as 40% of platelet PGH synthase was covalently modified after incubation with 17 microM AA. It can be concluded that in intact platelets PGH synthase is covalently modified by an eicosanoid following incubation with exogenous AA or after AA mobilization from phospholipids by thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1482564031,"Four flourescein isothiocyanate (FITC) derivatives of Naja naja siamemsis 3 neurotoxin (alpha-toxin), labeled at the epsilon-amino groups of Lys-23, Lys-35, Lys-49, or Lys-69, and a tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) derivative, labeled at epsilon-amino group of Lys-23, were prepared and used to analyze the orientation of cobra alpha-toxin on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AcChR) relative to both the plane of the membrane and the central ion channel. Fluorescence-quenching studies of the AcChR-bound FITC derivatives indicated significant solute accessibility to each site of labeling and suggested that none of the sites of FITC labeling is included in the binding surface of the alpha-toxin. Labeling of Lys-23 with TRITC did not affect the affinity of the alpha-toxin toward the AcChR and confirmed, contrary to some previous reports, a minimal role of Lys-23 in the binding surface of the alpha-toxin. Measurements of energy transfer between the lipid-membrane surface and the sites of labeling on receptor-bound alpha-toxin derivatives show that the relative distances of closest approach between the surface of the lipid membrane domain and the sites of labeling are in the order Lys-23 less than or equal to Lys-49 less than Lys-35 less than or equal to Lys-69. Energy transfer between AcChR tryptophans and the sites of labeling of bound derivatives was about 50% greater to Lys-49 than to Lys-23, Lys-35, or Lys-69, suggesting that Lys-49 is closer to receptor tryptophans and to the center of the extracellular domain of the receptor than Lys-23, Lys-35, or Lys-69. Combined with previous observations that the tip of the central loop of the alpha-toxin directly interacts with the AcChR, the above results suggest a model of the approximate orientation of the snake neurotoxins on the receptor. This model shows the tip of the central loop of the toxin directly interacting with the receptor surface and the major axis of the neurotoxin tilting from a perpendicular projection from the membrane. The surface of the alpha-toxin that includes Lys-23 projects away from the central ion channel and the surface that includes Lys-35 and Lys-69 faces the ion channel."
https://openalex.org/W1587025398,"To study structure/function relationships of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, one of the simplest modified t-PA structures to activate plasminogen in a fibrin-dependent manner was obtained by constructing an expression vector that deleted amino acid residues 4-175 from the full-length sequence of t-PA. The expression plasmid was introduced into a Syrian hamster cell line, and stable recombinant transformants, producing high levels of the modified plasminogen activator, were isolated. The resulting molecule, mt-PA-6, comprising the second kringle and serine protease domains of t-PA, produced a doublet of plasminogen activator activity having molecular masses of 40 and 42 kDa. The one-chain mt-PA-6 produced by cultured Syrian hamster cells was purified in high yield by affinity and size exclusion chromatography. The purified mt-PA-6 displayed the same two types of microheterogeneity observed for t-PA. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing demonstrated that one-chain mt-PA-6 existed in both a GAR and a des-GAR form. Purified mt-PA-6 also existed in two glycosylation forms that accounted for the 40- and 42-kDa doublet of activity produced by the cultured Syrian hamster cells. Separation of these two forms by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and subsequent tryptic peptide mapping demonstrated that both forms contained N-linked glycosylation at Asn448; in addition, some mt-PA-6 molecules were also glycosylated at Asn184. Plasmin treatment of one-chain mt-PA-6 converted it to a two-chain molecule by cleavage of the Arg275-Ile276 bond. This two-chain mt-PA-6, like t-PA, had increased amidolytic activity. The fibrinolytic specific activities of the one- and two-chain forms of mt-PA-6 were similar and twice that of t-PA. The plasminogen activator activity of one-chain mt-PA-6 was enhanced greater than 80-fold by CNBr fragments of fibrinogen, and the one-chain enzyme lysed human clots in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. The ability to produce and purify a structurally simple plasminogen activator with desirable fibrinolytic properties may aid in the development of a superior thrombolytic agent for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction."

In contrast, the position of processing of a mutant tRNA(His) precursor (containing a G27----A27 alteration) was shown to be condition-dependent. Processing occurred at A27 under conditions consistent with formation of an A27-C100 base pair in the acceptor stem but at G28 under conditions that disfavored base pair formation. The ability to control the site of RNase P-mediated tRNA precursor processing is unprecedented and permits analysis of the chemical factors that promote processing."
