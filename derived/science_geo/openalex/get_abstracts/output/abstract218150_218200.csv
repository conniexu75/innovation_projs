Synthetic sodium acrylate possesses chemical and antibacterial properties identical with those of the natural product. This observation identifies the algal substance in the stomach contents of euphausids, the diet of pygoscelid penguins, which inhibits the penguin gastrointestinal microflora."

To test this prediction, the lever was withdrawn from a Skinner box for varying times, then replaced and normal extinction completed. The number of extinction trials was a simple function of the time the lever was out of the box, thus confirming Deutsch's hypothesis that cessation of responding in this instance is due to a decay of a motivational excitation produced by the electrical stimulation, and not a function of the number of unreinforced trials as in normal extinction."

https://openalex.org/W2000161665,"A NEW phenotype in the Kidd blood group system, Jk (a–b–), has recently been recognized in a Filipina of Spanish and Chinese ancestry1. This phenotype is extremely rare in Whites and Negroes; its incidence in Asian people or their descendants has not as yet been determined. We recently had the opportunity to study the blood groups of a number of Brazilian Indians indigenous to the northern part of Mato Grosso in the region of the headwaters of the Upper Xingu River. Because of the peculiar geographical features defining this area, these Indians live in virtual isolation, and because of tribal customs, marriage is exclusively between first cousins. The present communication reports the frequency of the phenotype Jk (a–b–) and evidence for a new allele, Jk, in a sample of this population."

Although deoxyribonucleic acid and cellulose increase markedly the rate of Fe(III)-catalysed pyrogallol oxidation by hydrogen peroxide2,3, a similar test of polysaccharides has not been reported previously in peroxidase-catalysed reactions."

The possibility of such an enzymic inactivation was first recognized by Darpoux and Faivre-Amiot4."

https://openalex.org/W2076247474,"LYMPHOID tissue exposed to certain lipid emulsions undergoes a gross and widespread necrosis, while exposure either to the lipid or emulsifier alone produces only minor ‘reactive’ changes. This phenomenon, which, so far as we know, had not been previously reported, was first described by one Bennett and Shivas1. Further work still in progress has shown that necrosis can be produced by a wide variety of lipid emulsions and the effect appears to be a general property of these. Emulsions containing 20 per cent w/v ethyl stearate, ethyl laurate, ‘F 99’ (a preparation of ethyl esters of linoleic and linolenic acids), stearic acid, lauric acid, olive oil and liquid paraffin have been given in a single dose of 2 ml. to fully grown young rats by the intraperitoneal route under direct vision at laparotomy with ether anæsthesia. The emulsifiers used are ‘Tween 80’, ox bile and gum acacia. Glyceryl monostearate emulsions were prepared without any added emulsifying agent. Unemulsified lipids and aqueous solutions of emulsifying agents (with the exception of ox bile) have also been administered separately at concentrations equivalent to those in the emulsions."

https://openalex.org/W2014850637,"Human choice reaction time was studied as a function of sense modality and inter- versus intrasensory coding at three levels of stimulus strength. Unlike the case in earlier studies, stimulus strength was equated across sense modalities. Classical findings were supported for strength and modality; intersensory coding was superior to intrasensory coding."
https://openalex.org/W1976146571,ZINC has been shown to play an important part in the activity of phosphatases1–7. We have now found evidence for the existence of a zinc-dependent alkaline phosphatase in the ventral lobe of the rat prostate. The hydrolysis of 0.002 M adenosine monophosphate in 0.065 M tris-(hydroxymethyl)-amino methane buffer at pH 9.4 by homogenates of the gland was progressively inhibited by increasing concentrations of zinc (Fig. 1).
