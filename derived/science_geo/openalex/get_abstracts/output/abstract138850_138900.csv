Recently, a molecule with sequence homology to caspase-8 was identified, termed cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). c-FLIP has been controversially reported to possess apoptosis-promoting and -inhibiting functions. Using c-FLIP-specific monoclonal antibodies, we now show that c-FLIP is expressed in two isoforms, both of which, like FADD and caspase-8, are recruited to the CD95 DISC in a stimulation-dependent fashion. In stably transfected BJAB cells, c-FLIP blocks caspase-8 activation at the DISC and thereby inhibits CD95-mediated apoptosis. During this process, both caspase-8 and c-FLIP undergo cleavage between the p18 and p10 subunits, generating two stable intermediates of 43 kDa that stay bound to the DISC. c-FLIP has been suggested to play a role in protecting activated peripheral T cells from CD95-mediated apoptosis (Irmler, M., Thome, M., Hahne, M., Schneider, P., Hofmann, K., Steiner, V., Bodmer, J. L., Schroter, M., Burns, K., Mattmann, C., Rimoldi, D., French, L. E., and Tschopp, J. (1997) Nature 388, 190–195). In contrast to this hypothesis, neither caspase-8 nor c-FLIP were cleaved in these cells, ruling out c-FLIP as the main factor regulating DISC activity. Moreover, recruitment of FADD, caspase-8, and c-FLIP to the DISC was strongly reduced in the apoptosis-resistant but readily detectable in the apoptosis-sensitive T cells.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that plays an important role in tissue homeostasis. In the immune system, apoptosis is used for negative selection in the thymus and bone marrow and to eliminate unwanted lymphocytes following an immune response (1Krammer P.H. Dhein J. Walczak H.

Recruitment of caspase-8 to the DISC leads to its proteolytic activation, which initiates a cascade of caspases, leading to apoptosis (10Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M.

Stimulation of resting peripheral T cells (in the following referred to as day 0 T cells) during an immune response leads to their activation (day 1 T cells) resulting in increased expression of several genes including IL-2 and CD95 (1Krammer P.H.

After prolonged culture in the presence of IL-2, activated T cells develop an apoptosis-sensitive phenotype (day 6 T cells) (11Owen-Schaub L.B. Yonehara S. Crump W.L. Grimm E.A.

Since CD95 surface expression does not significantly change between day 1 and day 6 T cells, the apoptosis-resistant phenotype of day 1 T cells must be caused by a block in CD95 signal transduction. We have previously shown that activation of caspase-8 at the DISC is inhibited in these resistant T cells, whereas Bcl-xL is highly up-regulated (17Peter M.E. Kischkel F.C. Scheuerpflug C.G.

However, this domain lacks residues that are important for its catalytic activity, most notably the cysteine within the active site. The short form of c-FLIP structurally resembles v-FLIP.

The in vivosituation of the endogenous protein remains unclear. However, it was suggested that in day 1 T cells, the apoptosis-resistant phenotype correlates with high c-FLIP expression, which was decreased in the sensitive day 6 T cells (26Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of c-FLIP in the CD95 pathway, we generated BJAB cells stably overexpressing c-FLIP and monoclonal antibodies against this protein. Using these tools, we now show that c-FLIP is predominantly found as a 55-kDa isoform in most cell lines independent of their resistant state toward CD95-mediated apoptosis. A minor c-FLIP species of 27/28 kDa (c-FLIPshort) was also detected in most cell lines. All forms of c-FLIP were found to be recruited to the DISC. Expressed at high levels in stable transfectants, c-FLIP completely blocked CD95-mediated apoptosis through inhibition of caspase-8 processing at the DISC. The mechanism of this inhibition involves cleavage of c-FLIP. c-FLIP seems to play only a minor role in apoptosis resistance of activated T cells, since it remained uncleaved in the resistant T cells and could be detected in day 0, day 1, and day 6 T cells at equal amounts. The Burkitt lymphomas Raji, BJAB, and SKW6.4; the T cell lymphomas H9, CEM, and Jurkat; the monocytic cell line U937; the cervix carcinoma HeLa; the breast carcinoma MCF-7; the colon carcinoma HT29; the hepatoma cell line HepG2; the myorhabdosarcoma cell line KYM-1; and the small cell lung carcinomas SCLC 16H and NCI N592 were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 5 mm HEPES. The embryonic kidney line 293T was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml gentamycin, and 10 mm HEPES. All cells were of human origin. An expressed sequence tag clone,AA115792, containing the complete c-FLIP open reading frame was identified by searching the public expressed sequence tag data base with a DED search profile. c-FLIP was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers CCGCTCGAGCGGATGTCTGCTGAAGTCATCCATCAGGTTG and GCTCTAGAGCTAAGTAGGAGAGGATAAGTTTCTTTCT and cloned into the mammalian expression vector pEFrsFLAG containing a N-terminal FLAG epitope tag sequence. The c-FLIP sequence was determined by automated DNA sequence analysis and found to be identical to the published sequences of FLAME-γ, MRIT, I-FLICE-L, c-FLIPlong, and Casper (26Irmler M. Thome M.

Anti-FADD and anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 mAbs were purchased from Transduction Laboratories, and the anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 polyclonal antiserum was a gift of B. Schraven (University of Heidelberg). The horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG1 and IgG2b antibodies and goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody were purchased from Southern Biotechnologies and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. All chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from Merck or Sigma. Immunoprecipitation of the CD95 DISC was carried out as described (37Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar, 38Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation of c-FLIP, 107 cells either unstimulated or treated with 1 μg/ml anti-APO-1 for 10 min were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, antipain, chymostatin, and pepstatin A) as described (9Kischkel F.C.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar), and the lysate was incubated with 20 μg of anti-c-FLIP affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (RF60) coupled to anti-rabbit IgG beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. For Western blot analysis, postnuclear supernatant equivalents of 106 cells or 50 μg of protein as determined by the BCA method (Pierce) were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and blocked with 5% nonfat drymilk in PBS/Tween (0.05% Tween 20 in PBS). After washing with PBS/Tween, the blots were incubated for 16 h with NF6 anti-c-FLIP, C15 anti-caspase-8, anti-FADD, or anti-mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies at 4 °C. Blots were washed again with PBS/Tween, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled isotype-specific secondary antibodies (1:20,000) for 1 h at room temperature, washed again, and developed with a chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products). To quantify the amount of c-FLIP and caspase-8 in cellular lysates, the specific anti-c-FLIP (NF6) and anti-caspase-8 (C15) monoclonal antibodies were used in a Western blot analysis to compare the signal obtained from endogenous expressed c-FLIP and caspase-8 with defined amounts of 6-HIS-c-FLIP and 6-HIS-caspase-8. For stripping, blots were incubated for 30 min in a buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 60 °C. Then the blots were washed six times for 10 min in PBS/Tween and blocked again in 5% nonfat dry milk. Human peripheral T cells were prepared as described previously (12Klas C. Debatin K.M. Jonker R.R. Krammer P.H. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 625-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). For activation, resting T cells (day 0) were cultured at 2 × 106 cells/ml with 1 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin for 16 h (day 1). Day 1 T cells were then washed three times and cultured for an additional 5 days in the presence of 25 units/ml or 100 units/ml IL-2 (day 6). For assaying apoptosis, 106cells were incubated in 24-well-plates with or without 1 μg/ml anti-APO-1 plus 10 ng/ml protein A in medium for 16 h at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged briefly in a Minifuge (Heraeus) at 4000 rpm for 5 min, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in a buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). After incubation at 4 °C in the dark for at least 16 h, apoptotic nuclei were quantified by FACScan (Becton Dickinson). Specific apoptosis was calculated as follows: (percentage of experimental apoptosis − percentage of spontaneous apoptosis)/(100 − percentage of spontaneous apoptosis) × 100. BJAB cells were transfected by electroporation (960 microfarads, 200 V) using a Gene Pulser™ (Bio-Rad) with control vector (pEFrsFLAG) or c-FLIP expression vector (pEFrsFLAG-c-FLIP). Transfectants were selected in supplemented RPMI 1640 medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). High expressing clones were identified by Western blot analysis using the anti-c-FLIP mAb NF6. Recently, a molecule that was found to be structurally related to caspase-8, c-FLIP, was identified containing two DEDs at its N terminus (Refs. 26Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K.

Mechanical activation of TRAAK in the central nervous system may play an important role during growth cone motility and neurite elongation. A key feature of all classes of K+ channel pore-forming subunits is a conserved signature sequence constituting the pore segment (P) 1The abbreviations used are: P, pore segment; TMS, transmembrane segment(s); AA, arachidonic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TNP, trinitrophenol; WT, wild type; Npo, number of channels × open channel probability. (7Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Mammalian K+ channels can be divided into three major structural classes encoding channels with six transmembrane segments (TMS), 4TMS and 2TMS (7Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The 6TMS class comprises voltage-gated as well as Ca2+-gated K+ channels. The inward rectifier IRK, the G protein-coupled GIRK and the ATP-gatedK ATP K+ channel subunits are members of the 2TMS structural class. The most recent structural class of 4TMS mammalian K+ channel subunits consists so far of five members (TWIK-1, TREK-1, TRAAK, TASK, and TASK-2) (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30863-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Besides the presence of 4TMS, the other major structural characteristic is the presence of two P regions as well as an extended M1P1 extracellular loop (8Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although these subunits display the same structural motif (4TMS/2P), they only share 25–40% sequence identity. These unusual K+ channel structures are associated with unique physiological properties. TWIK-1 is an ubiquitous subunit, which directs the expression of a time- and voltage-independent K+-selective weak inward rectifier in Xenopusoocytes (4Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). TREK-1 is highly expressed in brain, heart, lung, kidney, and several other tissues and encodes a mammalian serotonin-sensitive-like K+ channel (3Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G.

Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). TRAAK is opened by polyunsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic acid (AA) (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The present report demonstrates that TRAAK is also opened by membrane stretch and thus belongs to the class of mechano-gated ion channels (9Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev.

Rev. 1996; 48: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cDNA for TRAAK was subcloned into the pIRES-Neo expression vector (CLONTECH), and the resulting construct was transfected in COS cells using the phosphate calcium method. After 48 h in normal medium, the transfected cells were dissociated and subcultured by 1:20 dilution in medium containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Antibiotic-resistant clones were selected at random after 2 weeks. A TRAAK-expressing clone was then identified by using an 86Rb+ efflux assay as well as electrophysiology and expanded to maintain a stock culture. Anti-TRAAK antibodies were raised against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal 102 amino acids of TRAAK (residues Pro296 to Val398). The antibodies were purified by using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the same domain of TRAAK. The preparation of fusion proteins, rabbit immunization, and antibody purification were performed as described previously (8Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Proteins from COS cells and from synaptic plasma membranes of mouse spinal cord were prepared and analyzed in the presence of reducing agents (8Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). For immunocytology, TRAAK immunodetection was performed as described previously (8Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), except that cells were permeabilized by adding 0.1% Triton X-100 in the blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% BSA and 5% goat serum). COS-7-TRAAK cells were plated at a density of 40,000 cells/well (Falcon, 24 wells) and used 2–3 days later. Cells were preloaded for 3 h with 0.5–1 μCi/ml 86Rb+ in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 500 μg/ml Geneticin at 37 °C. Release experiments were then carried out in a standard (EXT) saline solution containing (in mm: 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4, with NaOH) during consecutive intervals of 5 min at room temperature. For each point six independent experiments were performed at the same time. An hour washing with EXT solution was then performed before collecting 1-ml fractions. 86Rb+ at 2–7 mCi/mg was from NEN Life Science Products. Fractional rates of release were calculated as 86Rb+ released during each 5-min interval and expressed as the percentage of 86Rb+content in the cells at the beginning of the respective intervals.86Rb+ was counted on a Packard Tri-Carb with a Cerenkov program. The electrophysiology procedure has been described elsewhere previously (5Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). For whole-cell experiments, bath solution (EXT) contained (in mm) 150 NaCl, 5 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 Hepes, pH 7.4, with NaOH and pipette solution (INT) contained (in mm) 150 KCl, 3 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, and 10 Hepes, pH 7.2, with KOH. For cell attached experiments, the EXT solution contained 150 KCl instead of 150 NaCl, and the pipette contained the EXT solution (150 mmNaCl). For inside-out experiments the pipette solution was EXT and the bath solution was INT. Mechanical stimulation was applied through an open-loop pressure generating system and monitored at the level of the patch pipette throughout the experiment by a calibrated pressure sensor. This system provides a stable pressure pulse (5Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Colchicine was dissolved daily in the saline solution at the concentration of 500 μm. Cytochalasin D was dissolved at the concentration of 1 mg/ml in Me2SO and kept at −20 °C. AA was dissolved in ethanol at the concentration of 100 mm, flushed with argon, and kept at −20 °C for a week. TNP was mixed with the saline solutions and pH adjusted. 4-Bromophenacyl bromide was dissolved daily at 100 mm in Me2SO and AACOCF3 at 100 mm in ethanol. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. TRAAK was transfected in COS cells, and a stable TRAAK cell line was characterized by immunoblot using affinity-purified antibodies directed against the carboxyl terminus of TRAAK (Fig.1, A–C). A major band is detected with a relative molecular mass (M r) of 54,000–64,000 and two minor bands of M r 49,000 and 52,000 (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). No signal is detected in nontransfected COS cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). The difference between the observed M rvalues and the calculated molecular mass of TRAAK (43,000 Da) is probably due to glycosylation. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of two consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation (residues 81 and 84) in a region of the channel that is expected to be extracellular (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). This probable glycosylation of TRAAK is also observed in the spinal cord (Fig. 1 A, lane 3), a tissue that is known to express a high level of TRAAK transcript (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Additional bands of M r 49,000 and 52,000, which are detected in transfected COS cells, could correspond to incompletely glycosylated or partially degraded forms of the protein. The heterologous expression of TRAAK was confirmed by immunocytology (Fig.1, B and C). A strong signal is observed at the plasma membrane of the cells expressing TRAAK (Fig. 1 C), while it is absent in control WT COS cells (Fig. 1 B). The expression of exogenous K+ channel activity was initially detected in the TRAAK cell line using86Rb+ efflux (Fig. 1,D–F). Control COS cells (WT) do not show any significant increase in 86Rb+ efflux in the presence of AA (Fig. 1 D). However, cells expressing TRAAK display a reversible 3–4-fold increase in86Rb+ efflux induced by AA (Fig. 1,D and E). AA activation is reversed by the addition of micromolar concentrations of Gd3+(IC50: 5 ± 1 μm) (Fig.1 E). The TRAAK cell line was then used for electrophysiological investigations. In the whole cell configuration, basal channel activity is low (TRAAK: 12.2 ± 1.3 pA/picofarad, n = 12; COS WT: 4.2 ± 0.5 pA/picofarad, n = 18; at 100 mV) (Fig. 2 A). An outward current is slowly and reversibly induced at a holding potential of 0 mV by AA superfusion (4.8 ± 0.4-fold, n = 12) (Fig.2 A, bottom inset). This current is absent in mock-transfected COS cells (n = 18) (5Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). The I-V curve of the current induced by AA displays a strong outward-going rectification (Fig. 2 A). The reversal potential of the current activated by AA reverses at −83.7 ± 0.7 mV (n = 12), which is the predicted value for EK+. Opening of TRAAK is also reversibly induced by the amphipathic membrane crenator TNP (6.7 ± 1.1-fold, n = 6 with 400 μm TNP) (15Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Nature. 1990; 348: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar,17Sheetz M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). The kinetics for current activation is faster in the presence of TNP compared with AA (Fig. 2 A, insets). I-V curves in the presence of TNP and AA are similar. Finally, as observed with 86Rb+ efflux experiments, TRAAK activation by AA is also blocked by Gd3+ (−64.2 ± 4.7%,n = 8 with 10 μm Gd3+) (Fig.2 B). In the cell-attached patch configuration, no channel activity is detected under resting conditions (NPo: 0.05 ± 0.03,n = 6). However, we observed that TRAAK opens when a negative pressure is applied to the patch pipette (Fig.3 A). No channel activity is observed in mock-transfected COS cells (5Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B, channel activity is absent at atmospheric pressure but three TRAAK 38-picosiemens channels readily and reversibly open during the application of a −66 mm Hg pressure. As reported previously for AA activation, TRAAK opening was characterized by flickering kinetics (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Both the number of active channels and the sensitivity to mechanical stretch are strongly enhanced after a treatment for 20 min with colchicine (500 μm) (Fig. 3, C–E). The threshold for mechanical activation is lowered from −70 to −20 mm Hg, and maximal channel activity is enhanced at all indicated pressures in the presence of colchicine (Fig. 3, C and D). Similarly, addition of cytochalasin D (5 μg/ml) enhances channel activity with, however, a weaker effect (Fig. 3 E). Finally, excision of the patch in the inside-out configuration, which is known to disrupt cytoskeletal elements, produces an almost 10-fold increase in channel activation induced by a −70 mm Hg pressure (Fig.3 E). Moreover, the threshold for mechanical activation is also significantly lowered after excision of the patch (Fig.4 A). In the inside-out patch configuration, channel activity is basically absent at atmospheric pressure, and only negative, but not positive, pressure induces channel opening (Fig. 4 B). The I-V curve performed with a voltage ramp protocol in physiological K+ conditions is outwardly rectifying and reverses at −80 mV, the predicted value for the equilibrium potential for K+ (Fig.4 B). The absence of channel activation by positive pressure in the inside-out patch configuration suggests that channel opening is mediated by a specific membrane deformation. Indeed, in the outside-out patch configuration, TRAAK opening is only induced by positive pressure (Fig. 5 A). The activation of TRAAK is purely pressure-dependent, and moreover, as observed in both the cell-attached and inside-out configurations, channel activity is absent at atmospheric pressure. Opening of TRAAK by positive pressure in outside-out patches is reversibly blocked by the addition of 30 μm Gd3+ (n = 3) (Fig. 5 B). We then investigated the effect of voltage on TRAAK activation in the inside-out patch configuration. Fig. 6shows that opening of TRAAK by membrane stretch is enhanced by membrane depolarization. The threshold for mechanical activation by negative pressure is lowered at depolarized voltage, and moreover maximal NPo is significantly enhanced (Fig. 6 C). The basal NPo measured at atmospheric pressure is also significantly increased at depolarized potential (Fig. 6, A–C). The steep modulation of TRAAK activation occurs at voltages between −25 and 50 mV. We investigated the possible interaction between the membrane crenator TNP and membrane stretch. Fig. 7,A and B, show that in the inside-out configuration, internal application of TNP has no effect at atmospheric pressure. However, TNP produces a significant reversible stimulation of the opening of TRAAK by negative pressure (Fig. 7, A andB). Interestingly, in the outside-out configuration, external TNP produces a significant activation of TRAAK at both atmospheric and positive pressures (Fig. 7, C andD). Finally, to assay for the possible involvement of AA in the mechano-activation of TRAAK, we investigated the effect of 30 μm lipid-free BSA, which is known to bind fatty acids and remove them from membranes (18Ordway R.W. Petrou S. Kirber M.T. Walsh Jr., J. Singer J.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 331-337Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Application of BSA on both sides of the membrane did not alter the activation of TRAAK by a −50 mm Hg pressure in the inside-out patch configuration (n = 6; data not shown). Moreover, the addition of the phospholipase A2 blockers 4-bromophenacyl bromide (30 μm) and arachidonyltrifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3) (30 μm) to the cytosolic face of inside-out patches for 5 min did not alter activation of TRAAK by a −50 mm Hg pressure (n = 5; data not shown). TRAAK is a member of the novel K+ channel family with two P domains and four transmembrane segments (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Despite a similar membrane topology, the 2P/4TMS channels display little sequence identity (about 25%). When compared with TWIK-1 and TREK-1, TRAAK has a shorter amino-terminal region but an extended C terminus (3Fink M. Duprat F. Lesage F. Reyes R. Romey G. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 4Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. Romey G. Barhanin J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). TRAAK has a large extracellular loop between M1 and P1, with a cysteine residue at position Cys52 analogous to the cysteine residue Cys69 involved in the disulfide-bridged homodimerization of TWIK-1 (8Lesage F. Reyes R. Fink M. Duprat F. Guillemare E. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6400-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). TRAAK is only expressed in brain, retina, and spinal cord (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The most intense levels of expression are present in the olfactory system, cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, habenula, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. This laboratory demonstrated that TRAAK is opened by AA (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The activation of TRAAK by AA is reversible, concentration-dependent, and direct (i.e. not via protein kinase C). Other polyunsaturated fatty acids also open TRAAK, while saturated fatty acids are without effect (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). TRAAK current is instantaneous and outwardly rectifying in a physiological K+ gradient. Finally, TRAAK is only inhibited by high concentrations of Ba2+ and is insensitive to the other classical K+ channel blockers, including tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine, and Cs+ (1Fink M. Lesage F. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Reyes R. Fosset M. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The anionic amphipath TNP has been shown previously to expand the exterior half of the lipid bilayer and thereby induce human erythrocytes to crenate (17Sheetz M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Moreover, TNP was shown to activate bacterial mechano-gated cationic channels, and this effect was attributed to membrane crenation (15Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Nature. 1990; 348: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that TNP is a strong activator of TRAAK. TRAAK opening by TNP is observed in the whole cell as well as in the excised outside-out patch configurations, suggesting a rather direct mechanism (i.e. without second messenger). Interestingly, no significant effect of TNP (at the concentration used) is observed under resting conditions in the inside-out patch configuration. This observation suggests that TNP may act preferentially via the external side of the membrane. It has been hypothesized previously that because of the negative charges (mainly phosphatidylserine) of the inner leaflet, anionic amphipaths may preferentially insert in the external leaflet of the plasma membrane (15Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Nature. 1990; 348: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Sheetz M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). The differential insertion of these amphipaths in the external lipid monolayer induces a curvature of the membrane which generates transversal forces that may alter channel activity. This model implies that TRAAK may be sensitive to mechanical forces transmitted via the membrane. In every configuration tested, basal channel activity measured at atmospheric pressure was basically absent. In the inside-out patch configuration, TRAAK is opened by negative pressure, while it is opened by positive pressure in the outside-out patch configuration. These results suggest that TRAAK is selectively activated by a convex curvature of the membrane. This result fits well with the bilayer couple model of the membrane described above (15Martinac B. Adler J. Kung C. Nature. 1990; 348: 261-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Sheetz M. Singer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar). Channel activity was graded with applied pressure and was maintained throughout stimulation, demonstrating the absence of an adaptation process. TRAAK can be opened by both arachidonic acid as well as membrane stretch. A mechanically sensitive phospholipase A2 (19Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) could therefore couple membrane stretch to TRAAK opening as suggested for stretch-activated K+ channels in gastric smooth muscle (18Ordway R.W. Petrou S. Kirber M.T. Walsh Jr., J. Singer J.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 331-337Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although the addition of lipid-free BSA as well as the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) inhibitors do not alter the activation of TRAAK by mechanical stimulation, we cannot entirely rule out such a mechanism. Disruption of the cytoskeleton by either chemical or mechanical means (colchicine, cytochalasin D, or membrane excision) potentiates TRAAK opening by membrane stretch. These results suggest that mechano-gating does not require the integrity of the cytoskeleton. Moreover, these results imply that the activating force is coming directly from the bilayer membrane. Finally, the up-regulation of channel activity suggests that TRAAK is tonically repressed by the cytoskeleton. Dynamic regulation of cytoskeletal components through, for instance, phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is thus expected to have an important effect on the indirect regulation of TRAAK channel activity. Opening of TRAAK is clearly facilitated at depolarized potentials (between −25 and 50 mV). Depolarization lowers the threshold for mechanical activation and increases the maximal channel activity (NPo). The 2P/4TMS channels lack the positively charged S4 voltage sensor found in Shaker-type K+ channels (7Wei A. Jegla T. Salkoff L. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 805-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Thus the region responsible for the voltage-dependent modulation of TRAAK remains to be determined. An important physiological implication of these findings is that activation of TRAAK (induced mechanically or chemically) will be mostly efficient at positive potentials (i.e. during an action potential). The inside- and outside-out experiments indicate that TNP synergize with pressure activation. This result suggests that physiologically, mechanical activation of TRAAK may be most effective when endogenous amphipathic crenators are produced. In conclusion, this report demonstrates that the mammalian neuronal 2P/4TMS K+ channel TRAAK belongs to the mechano-gated ion channel family (9Sukharev S.I. Blount P. Martinac B. Kung C. Annu. Rev.

Biol. 1992; 127: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Stretch-activated K+channels have been described in several neuronal cell types, including snail and Aplysia neurons as well as in rat hippocampal neurons (20Kim D.H. Sladek C.D. Aguadovelasco C. Mathiasen J.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1995; 484: 643-660Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 21Morris C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 113: 93-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 22Sigurdson W.J.

Small D.L. Dabrowski A.R. Morris C.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 46-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The presence of stretch-activated K+ channels in the growth cones of Lymnaea stagnalis neurons suggested that these channels may be involved in the modulation of axonal pathfinding and guidance (22Sigurdson W.J. Morris C.E. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 2801-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, growth cone motility is a mechanical process where neurite membranes experience important tension changes. Activation of TRAAK during cell locomotion may participate via membrane hyperpolarization to the fine regulation of intracellular calcium, actin-myosin contractions and thus neurite elongation. Finally, the expression of TRAAK in dorsal root ganglia 2C. Heurteaux, personal communication. may suggest its possible role in more specialized sensory functions such as touch detection and/or pain sensation. We previously identified a charged region in the COOH terminus of TREK-1 (Arg297–Glu306:RVISKKTKEE), which is critically involved in channel activation by AA as well as mechanical stimulation. This region is conserved in TRAAK (Arg259–Glu268:RAVSRRTRAE) and may also fulfill an important function for TRAAK activation. We are grateful to Dr. A. Patel for critical and careful reading of the manuscript."

ALG-2 and AIP1 colocalize in the cytosol and the presence of calcium is an indispensable requisite for their association. Sequence alignment shows that AIP1 is highly similar to BRO1, a yeast protein related to components of the Pkc1p-MAP kinase cascade.Overexpression of a truncated form of AIP1 protects two different cell types from death induced by trophic factors withdrawal; thus, our data indicate that AIP1 cooperates with ALG-2 in executing the calcium-dependent requirements along the cell death pathway.

Programmed cell death (PCD) 1The abbreviations used are: PCD, programmed cell death; HA, hemagglutinin; kb, kilobase(s); GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. is a physiologically regulated cell type-specific deletion that takes place during various developmental stages of multicellular organisms and is essential for the establishment and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (1Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). PCD occurs by apoptosis, which refers to the morphological changes that can be observed in cells undergoing PCD. These include plasma membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA degradation (2Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). The process eventually culminates with the fragmentation of the cells into apoptotic bodies that, in vivo, are rapidly phagocitized by the surrounding cells (3Arends M.J. Wyllie A.H. Int. Rev. Exp. Pathol. 1991; 32: 223-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). The suicide signal can be received and transduced into the cell through death receptors that initiate a signaling cascade, which shortly leads to cell demise (4Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A number of molecules have been identified that either regulate the death pathway or are able to modulate the death signal. Most attention has recently focused on the interleukin-1β converting enzyme-like proteases, a family of at least 10 related mammalian cysteine proteases collectively named caspases (5Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4145) Google Scholar). These proteins are considered the executioners of mammalian apoptosis by virtue of two seminal observations: (a) ectopic overexpression of interleukin-1β converting enzyme, as well as other members of the family, results in protease activation and induces apoptosis (6Miura M. Zhu H. Rotello R. Hartwieg E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar, 7Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1613-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and (b) specific inhibitors of these proteases inhibit cell death (8Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 9Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the caspase paradigm asserts that cells undergoing apoptosis accomplish their suicide program by activating a hierarchy of caspases. However activation of caspases does not always correlate with induction of apoptosis (10Miossec C. Dutilleul V. Fassy F. Diu-Hercend A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13459-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 11Wilhelm S. Wagner H. Hacker G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and in some circumstances, caspase activity is required for protection from apoptosis (12Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C.M. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In addition to proteases activation, numerous evidence demonstrates that alterations in intracellular calcium play an important role during apoptosis. For some time it has been proposed that DNA fragmentation, a general hallmark of apoptosis, is a Ca2+-dependent event that requires a Ca2+-activated endonuclease (13Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42PubMed Google Scholar, 14Peitsch M.C. Polzar B. Stephan H. Crompton T. MacDonald H.R. Mannherz H.G. Tschopp J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Induction of apoptosis triggers an increase of [Ca2+]i as well (15Nakayama T. Ueda Y. Yamada H. Shores E.W. Singer A. June C.H. Science. 1992; 257: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16McConkey D.J. Hartzell P. Amador-Perez J.F. Orrenius S. Jondal M. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 1801-1806PubMed Google Scholar), and intracellular chelators of Ca2+ inhibit cell death (17Oshimi Y. Miyazaki S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 599-609PubMed Google Scholar). As consequence of Fas stimulation, calcium is immediately mobilized from intracellular stores (17Oshimi Y. Miyazaki S. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 599-609PubMed Google Scholar), and lymphoid cells rendered deficient for the calcium release channels are resistant to apoptosis induced by different stimuli (18Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 19Khan A.A. Soloski M.J. Sharp A.H. Schilling G. Sabatini D.M. Li S.H. Ross C.A. Snyder S.H. Science. 1996; 273: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Of interest, and consistent with the literature, the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 decreases calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum stores (20Lam M. Dubyak G. Chen L. Nunez G. Miesfeld R.L. Distelhorst C.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6569-6573Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Considering these data altogether, the existence of a Ca2+-sensitive step(s) along the cell death pathway is clearly apparent. Although a precise picture of how Ca2+ exerts these effects at the molecular level is still not available, it is likely that transduction of Ca2+-regulated signals occurs through Ca2+-binding proteins. Members of the EF hand Ca2+-binding protein family exhibit Ca2+ affinities and binding kinetics compatible with concentration and time range of Ca2+ wave (21Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). The functional and structural Ca2+-binding unit is the helix-loop-helix motif commonly called EF hand domain. One of them, ALG-2, is a 22-kDa protein that was identified during a screening for genes involved in apoptosis (22Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 23D'Adamio L. Lacana E. Vito P. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). T-cell hybridoma clones depleted of ALG-2 via transfection of the antisense cDNA are resistant to cell death induced by diverse stimuli, including T-cell receptor and Fas stimulation as well as dexamethasone, staurosporine, and ceramide treatment. Nonetheless, in these ALG-2-deficient clones caspases are normally activated upon induction of cell death, as determined by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase and of a fluorogenic substrate (24Lacana E. Ganjei J.K. Vito P. D'Adamio L. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5129-5135PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we report the cloning of AIP1, a novel gene that interacts with ALG-2 in a calcium-regulated fashion. Overexpression of a deletion mutant of AIP1 protects HeLa and COS cells from apoptosis induced by serum starvation; thus AIP1 might mediate, at least in part, the ALG-2 requirement for apoptosis. The two-hybrid screening was conducted using the Matchmaker system fromCLONTECH according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast strain Y190 was transformed with the corresponding bait plasmids by lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol 4000 procedure and selected on synthetic dropout plates lacking tryptophan. Selected colonies were then analyzed for expression of the GAL4-bait fusion protein by immunoblot analysis. For library screening, yeast Y 190 expressing GAL4-ALG-2 fused protein was sequentially transformed with a mouse liver cDNA library cloned in the pGAD10 vector (CLONTECH). 2 × 106 clones were analyzed. Transformed yeast were selected on synthetic dropout/agar plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine in the presence of 50 mm 3-aminotriazol (Sigma) and grown for 5 days at 30 °C. Colonies positive for growth on selective media were blotted on filter paper (Whatman No. 5), permeabilized in nitrogen liquid, and placed on another filter soaked in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 37.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. Colonies that developed color were re-streaked on selective plates to allow plasmid segregation and tested again for β-galactosidase activity. Yeast colonies were then scored as positive when a bright color developed in 2–5 h, a negative was scored when color failed to develop within 12 h. Assays were done for 5–10 independent transformant. The cDNA insert contained in clone TH 28 was used to screen phage murine liver and a 3DO T-cell hybridoma cDNA libraries. Nucleotide sequences of several cDNA clones, as well as the cDNA insert of clone TH 28, were determined on both strands with Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA insert contained in clone TH 28 was also used to probe a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA insert of clone TH 28was cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with an HA epitope the provides a Kozak consensus sequence and a methionine for translation. AIP1 full-length (3.8 kb) was cloned in pcDNA3 joining a 1.6-kbEcoRI/BsrGI fragment from a liver cDNA clone with a 2.4-kb BsrGI/NotI fragment from clone TH 28. Most of the other plasmid constructs used were made by polymerase chain reaction performed with primers containing appropriate restriction sites or epitope tags as needed. GST fusion proteins were made in pGEX vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasmid constructs were confirmed by partial sequencing and immunoblot analysis. The cDNA encoding for full-length AIP1 was transcribed and translated in vitroin the presence of l-[4,5-3H]leucine with the TNT-coupled lysate system (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. 293T, L66, HeLa, and COS cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. 3DO cells were cultured in RPMI, 5% fetal calf serum. The polypeptide DEIKKERESLENLK was used to generate rabbit polyclonal antisera. The whole rabbit serum was affinity-purified on CNBr-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with the antigenic peptide. HeLa and COS7 cells were transfected with lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's indications. 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method. Cell lysates were made in RIPA buffer, and protein concentration was determined by Bio-Rad protein assay; 10–20 μg of protein was subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with primary antibody followed by a secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Promega). Blots were developed using SuperSignal (Pierce) and visualized by exposure to autoradiography film. For coimmunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Lysates were divided and immunoprecipitated with the indicated antibodies; immunocomplexes were bound to protein A-agarose beads and resolved by SDS-PAGE as described above. L66 cells were grown in chamber slides, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and then permeabilized in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% saponine. AIP1 was visualized by incubating the cells with the affinity-purified anti-AIP1 antiserum for 30 min, washing several times with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.5% saponine, and then incubating for 30 min with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit. L66 cells hybridized in the presence of an excess (10 μg) of immunogenic peptide served as negative control. All steps were done at room temperature; the slides were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope. For subcellular fractionation, cells were homogenized with a glass Pyrex homogenizer in lysis buffer: 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. Nuclei were removed by centrifuging the homogenates at 1,000 × gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 130,000 ×g for 60 min to obtain the cytosolic and the membrane fraction. Immobilized GST-ALG-2 fusion protein (1 μg) was washed three times in wash buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) and added to 500 μl of binding buffer, which consisted of wash buffer supplemented with 1 mm EGTA and either CaCl2 or MgCl2. The amount of each of these reagents needed to obtain a given concentration of free cation was calculated with Free Calcium program (25Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagAIP1 and ALG-2 proteins were in vitro transcribed/translated as described above. The lysate (5 μl) was added to the immobilized GST-ALG-2 protein resuspend in binding buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rotation. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4 b,right panel, 5 μl of in vitro synthesized FLAG-AIP1 and ALG-2 proteins were incubated in binding buffer containing the indicated cation and were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak) and protein AG-Sepharose beads (Pierce). The beads were then washed six times in binding buffer, resuspend in loading buffer, and the sample analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. COS and HeLa cells were transfected with 2 μg of pcDNA3 expressing the indicated cDNA together with 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-gal (CLONTECH). 24 h after transfection the cells were treated with 1 μm etoposide or 1 μm staurosporine (Sigma) for 7 h or starved lowering the fetal calf serum concentration to 0.1%. β-Galactosidase activity was visualized by fixing the cells in 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min followed by staining in phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 mm each K3Fe(CN)6 and K4Fe(CN)6-H2O and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside for 1–3 h at 37 °C. The number of live blue cells and blue cells with apoptotic morphology were counted in at least four fields. To identify ALG-2 interacting proteins, we performed a two-hybrid screen with the full-length ALG-2 cDNA fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4BD). A plasmid library of fusion between the GAL4 transcription activation domain (GAL4AD) and cDNAs from mouse liver was screened for interaction with GAL4BD-ALG-2 fusion protein in the yeast reporter strain Y190. A total of fourteen clones were isolated that activated the β-galactosidase reporter when approximately 2 × 106 plasmids were transformed. Restriction mapping and sequencing of these 14 cDNAs revealed that three clones (TH 2, TH 28, andTH 37) had the same insert containing an open reading frame coding for 402 amino acids fused to GAL4AD. Further assays were then performed with clone TH 28 in the reporter yeast strain. As summarized in Table I, this library clone did not activate β-galactosidase by itself or when coexpressed with the empty GAL4BD vector or with a control plasmid. Conversely, it strongly interacted with GAL4BD-ALG-2, and no association was reported with truncated forms of ALG-2 deleted at the amino or carboxyl terminus. Hence, only the full-length ALG-2 specifically interacts with TH 28 in yeast.Table ITwo-hybrid interaction assay between clone TH 28 and ALG-2 constructsa, β-galactosidase activity was determined by a filter assay for yeast transformed with the indicated plasmid as described under “Experimental Procedures”; b, schematic representation of the full-length ALG-2 and the deletion constructs used in the assay.

Open table in a new tab a, β-galactosidase activity was determined by a filter assay for yeast transformed with the indicated plasmid as described under “Experimental Procedures”; b, schematic representation of the full-length ALG-2 and the deletion constructs used in the assay. The black boxes represent the calcium binding domains; the numbers indicate the amino acidic position. On Northern blots clone TH 28 detects a ∼4-kb transcript ubiquitously expressed, and an additional, less abundant, 7-kb transcript (Fig.1 a). The 3DO T-cell hydridoma expresses only the 4-kb mRNA, and the levels of transcription are not regulated by T-cell receptor stimulation or glucocorticoid treatment (data not shown). Using clone TH 28 as probe, we screened a mouse liver cDNA phage library and cloned the full-length cDNA, that we named AIP1 for ALG-2 InteractingProtein 1. The nucleotide sequences of several phage clones indicated that AIP1 consists of 840 amino acids (Fig.1 b). Accordingly, the in vitrotranscription/translation of full-length AIP1 cDNA generates a single polypeptide of ∼105 kDa (Fig. 1 c). A BLAST search revealed that several homologues of A21P1 have been cloned:YNK1 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (26Che S. Weil M.M. Etkin L.D. Epstein H.F. Kuang J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar),palA in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans (27Negrete-Urtasun S. Denison S.H. Arst Jr., H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1832-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and BRO1 in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (28Nickas M.E. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Functional and genetic evidence suggests that Bro-1 and palA participate in signal transduction pathways. A rabbit antiserum was raised against the polypeptide Asp561-Leu574 of the AIP1 amino acidic sequence, which is also included in the TH 28 sequence. Immunoblot analysis performed on cell lysates from L66 fibroblasts and 3DO T-cell hybridoma indicates that this antiserum recognizes the endogenous AIP1 protein as a single band migrating with an apparent molecular mass of 105 kDa. 293T cells transfected with AIP1 cDNA exhibit a specific band that comigrates with the endogenous AIP1 (Fig. 2 a). Both signals from murine cell lysates and transfected 293T cells were specific, because the immunoreactivity was abolished by competition with the immunogenic peptide (data not shown). We then tested whether the interaction between ALG-2 and AIP1 also occurs in mammalian cells. As shown in Fig. 2 b, HA-flagged AIP1 specifically coprecipitates with ALG-2 in lysates from 293T-transfected cells. As expected, HA-flagged TH 28 coprecipitates with ALG-2 as well. This latter observation suggests that in overexpression experiments TH 28 can potentially inhibit the association between ALG-2 and AIP1. In addition, in lysates from untransfected L66 cells and the T-cell hybridoma, the endogenous AIP1 coprecipitates with the endogenous ALG-2 (Fig. 2 c). Thus, ALG-2 and AIP1 physically interact in mammalian cells. To determine the cellular localization of AIP1, L66 fibroblasts were permeabilized and stained with the anti-AIP1 antiserum. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that AIP1 has a granular cytoplasmic distribution, consistent with a cytosolic localization of the protein (Fig.3). Subcellular fractionation experiments confirmed this observation. Immunoblot analysis of fractionated lysates from L66 cells showed that AIP1 was present mostly in the cytosolic fraction, although a portion of the protein also distributes in the membrane-containing fraction (Fig. 3 C). In the same assay ALG-2 localizes essentially in the cytosolic fraction. Together with the microscopic results, these data implicate that ALG-2 and AIP1 colocalize in the cytosolic compartment. Intracellular free Ca2+modulates the activity of Ca2+-binding proteins by binding to their EF hand domain(s). Some of these proteins undergo major conformational reorganization upon Ca2+ binding, which regulates the interactions with target protein(s) (21Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Since ALG-2 is known to undergo such a Ca2+-dependent conformational change (22Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), we asked whether Ca2+ could modulate the interaction with AIP1. In these experiments we used several [Ca2+], ranging from the physiological amount of free Ca2+ present in resting cells (∼50 nm) to a concentration that is reached during Ca2+ flux from storage compartments (1–2 μm). As shown in Fig.4 a, in vitrotranscribed/translated AIP1 and GST-ALG-2 fusion protein interact only when at least 750 nm free Ca2+ is present in the binding buffer. The specificity of Ca2+ was investigated by replacing Ca2+ with another divalent cation, Mg2+. At physiological intracellular concentrations of free Mg2+ (900 μm), ALG-2·AIP1 complex did not occur (Fig. 4 b). Overall, these data indicate that ALG-2 and AIP1 interact in a Ca2+-specific manner and only when intracellular concentrations of free Ca2+ increase above the normal resting level. The interaction of AIP1 with ALG-2 prompted us to investigate the effects of AIP1 expression on programmed cell death. To test for this, AIP1 and TH28 were individually cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the β-galactosidase gene in HeLa cells, which were subsequently treated with anti-Fas and TNF. However, no differences in cell death could be detected between experimental and control transfections in these experiments (data not shown). Nevertheless, when apoptotis was evoked by trophic factors withdrawal, a significant protective effect was observed on HeLa and COS cells transfected with TH 28 (Fig.5 a). A protective effect was also reported when cells were treated with staurosporine or etoposide. In this latter set of experiments, the cotranfection of ALG-2 along with TH 28 restores the susceptibility to cell death (Fig. 5,b and c). Work from many laboratories has implicated Ca2+signaling in the regulation of apoptosis in mammalian cells. In lymphoid cells, antigen-receptor engagement results in a sustained increase in intracellular [Ca2+], followed by alternative responses such as apoptosis or cellular activation and proliferation. Calcium ionophores induce apoptotic cell death in a variety of experimental systems, suggesting that an increase in intracellular [Ca2+] is sufficient to signal the cell to enter the apoptotic program. It appears, therefore, that while Ca2+is essential for a response to occur, the type of response is more dependent on the activation of specific pathways. Yet, the critical target(s) relating this calcium flux to cellular apoptosis are only partially identified. ALG-2 is a Ca2+-binding protein shown to be directly involved in the control of programmed cell death; however, knowledge concerning the biochemical mechanisms involving ALG-2 is still incomplete. In this study we have identified and characterized AIP1, a protein that interacts with ALG-2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The presence of Ca2+ is essential for this binding, presumably due to conformational requirements necessary for association which are satisfied only when ALG-2 is in a Ca2+-loaded state. The range of [Ca2+] needed for the association of the two proteins in vitro is compatible with physiological levels of cytosolic Ca2+. In fact, while in resting cells Ca2+ is maintained at relatively low concentration (10–100 nm), extracellular flux or release from intracellular stores can result in an increase to the 500–1000 nm range required for the interaction. This observation suggests that AIP1 and ALG-2 are dissociated in resting cells and associate following stimulation that results in intracellular [Ca2+] rise. Expression of a truncated form of AIP1 partially inhibits apoptosis evoked by some stimuli. The simplest interpretation of these experiments is that interaction between ALG-2 and AIP1 is required for cell death, and the polypeptide generated by TH 28 acts as a negative inhibitor of AIP1 by competing for binding to ALG-2. However, it is possible that the truncated protein encoded by TH 28 might still perform some of the functions executed by AIP1. This would explain why the inhibition of apoptosis that we observed was only partial and evident with only a few stimuli. More specific reagents will allow us to precisely determine the role of this association in programmed cell death and in cell physiology in general. AIP1 shows a high degree of homology to BRO1, a S. cerevisiae protein of 844 amino acids that is 22% identical to AIP1 over the entire sequence (28Nickas M.E. Yaffe M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2585-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Genetic and functional evidence relates BRO1 to components of the Pkc1p-MAP kinase cascade.BRO1 mutants, in fact, display phenotypes similar to those caused by deletion of BCK1, a gene encoding a MAP/ERK kinase that mediates maintenance of cell integrity. BRO1 mutations result in a temperature-sensitive osmoremedial growth defect, which is suppressed by Ca2+. Since BRO1 itself lacks calcium binding domains, it is likely that, in yeast, the function of BRO1 is regulated by an ALG-2-like protein. The homology between AIP1 and BRO1 suggests that one possible mechanism by which the interaction ALG-2/AIP1 might control programmed cell death is by activation of signal transduction pathways linked to MAP kinases. Consistent with this idea is the evidence that p38 MAP kinase is required for apoptosis induced by trophic factors withdrawal (29Kummer J.L. Rao P.K. Heidenreich K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20490-20494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, further studies are needed to define whether Ca2+-regulated signals influence, through AIP1, activation of MAP kinases. Involvement of other Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and phosphatases in apoptosis has been demonstrated previously. Expression of calcineurin, a Ca2+-dependent protein phosphatase that functions in T-cell activation, rapidly induces apoptosis in the absence of growth factors (30Shibasaki F. McKeon F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Because calcineurin activates the transcription factor NF-AT, it is possible that an alteration in gene transcription influences the decision to enter apoptosis. This is also supported by the recent evidence that NF-AT is activated during Ca2+-dependent apoptosis, and Bcl-2 suppresses the signaling through NF-AT by binding and sequestering of active calcineurin (31Shibasaki F. Kondo E. McKeon F. Nature. 1997; 386: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Whether AIP1 plays a role in this scenario remains to be determined. palA is the A. nidulans gene encoding for a 798-residues protein which displays 25.6% similarity to AIP1 and participates in the regulation of pH-dependent gene expression (27Negrete-Urtasun S. Denison S.H. Arst Jr., H.N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1832-1835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A homologue of AIP1 also exists in C. elegans, namely YNK1 (26Che S. Weil M.M. Etkin L.D. Epstein H.F. Kuang J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1354: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which encodes for a 798-amino acid protein. Interestingly, YNK1, palA, and AIP1 all conserve, near their carboxyl terminus, a proline-rich region containing the PXXP consensus sequence of SH3 domain-binding motifs. It is, therefore, likely that AIP1 is involved in a variety of complex cellular responses, of which apoptosis is only one of the possible outcomes.

The role of protein kinases and phosphatases in agonist-induced attenuation and recovery of β-adrenergic receptors was explored by two complementary approaches, antisense RNA suppression and co-immunoprecipitation of target elements. Protein phosphatases 2A and 2B are associated with the unstimulated receptor, the latter displaying a transient decrease followed by a 2-fold increase in the levels of association at 30 min following challenge with agonist.

Suppression of phosphatases 2A and 2B with antisense RNA or inhibition of their activity with calyculin A and FK506, respectively, blocks resensitization following agonist removal.

Protein phosphorylation is a critical element of agonist-induced desensitization involving at least three prominent kinase activities (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently, we reported cell-type-specific roles of various protein kinases in agonist-induced desensitization using oligodeoxynucleotides to suppress these enzymes transiently (2Shih M. Malbon C.C.

Suppression of protein kinase C, but not protein kinase A or β-adrenergic receptor kinase, amplified rather than attenuated agonist-induced desensitization in a variety of cell types. In the current work, we explore the role of protein kinases, phosphatases, and anchoring proteins in organizing associations with the β-adrenergic receptor. Protein kinase C is shown to be obligate for resensitization of GPLR, its action blocked by protein kinase C deficiency and by the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide, and mimicked by FK506, a protein phosphatase2B inhibitor. Protein kinase anchoring and scaffolding proteins have emerged as central elements in many aspects of cell signaling (10Mochly-Rosen D.

Human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). A431 cells were transfected with the pLNCX plasmid using Lipofectin® (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected A431 cells expressing antisense RNA to protein kinase A and protein phosphatase 2A and 2B were screened for suppression of the target enzyme as outlined below.

Chem. 1986; 216: 15360-15363Google Scholar, 20Uhler M.D. Carmichael D.F. Lee D.C. Chrivia J.C. Krebs E.G. McKnight G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1300-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and homogenized in 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm EDTA containing 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Nuclei were collected by low speed centrifugation. Fifty micrograms of post-nuclei fraction protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Expression of protein kinase C was probed with antibody against the α-isoform of protein kinase C (Life Technologies, Inc.). Protein kinase A and C activities were assessed by using commercially available assay kits purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The manufacturer's protocol was followed. Protein kinase A activity is defined as the amount of phosphate incorporated into a substrate peptide, Kemptide, in the presence of 10 μm cyclic AMP minus that incorporated in the presence of the protein kinase A inhibitor peptide (1 μm). The specific activity of protein kinase C is defined as the difference between the amount of phosphorylation of an acetylated peptide derived from myelin basic protein in the presence of 10 mm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate from the amount of phosphorylation occurring in the presence of 20 μmprotein kinase C inhibitory peptide (protein kinase Cα peptide 19–36). Protein phosphatase 2A was isolated by immunoprecipitation with antibodies to the catalytic subunit of PP2A (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The PP2A activity was measured using [32P]phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase A as a substrate and a commercially available kit (13188-016; Life Technologies, Inc.). PP2A-specific activity was defined as the activity sensitive to inhibition by 100 nmcalyculin A or 1 nm okadaic acid. For protein phosphatase 2B, two complementary techniques were employed for assay: immunostaining with antibodies to the catalytic subunit of PP2B (C26920; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and identification by the calmodulin-overlay assay. Calmodulin binding to the renatured SDS-PAGE gel (overlay) was detected using antibodies to calmodulin. The immunocomplexes then were made visible as described above. Both assays provide comparable results. The presence of AKAPs in A431 cells were detected by RII overlay assay as described (15Gray P.C. Tibbs V.C. Catterall W.A. Murphy B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, fifty micrograms of cell lysate or membrane protein was separated by electrophoresis on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. Filters were blocked with a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and incubated with RII α subunit for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the presence of AKAPs was detected using an goat anti-RII α antibody, as described in immunoblotting analysis. Antisense and control missense oligodeoxynucleotides with the same base composition, but in scrambled order, were synthesized and purified to cell culture-grade (Operon, Alameda, CA), as described (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Before addition to cells, oligodeoxynucleotides were mixed at a ratio of 1:3 (w/w) with DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim), a cationic diacylglycerol in liposomal form which serves as a delivery vehicle. A431 cells were treated with oligodeoxynucleotides (5 μg/ml) for 2 days prior to the analysis of the expression of the target molecule. Cells in which gravin was specifically suppressed by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were then analyzed for agonist-induced (isoproterenol) desensitization and resensitization following a wash-out of agonist (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The association of β2-adrenergic receptor with other proteins was probed by use of immunoprecipitation. Cells were harvested, and cell membrane was prepared by homogenization. The membranes were solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 6.0 μmdithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm sodium molybdate, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitation was performed in the lysis buffer. The lysates were pre-cleared with protein A/G-agarose for 90 min and then subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with antibodies specific either for the β-adrenergic receptor (CM4) or for AKAP250 gravin. The primary antibodies were linked covalently to a protein A/G-agarose matrix. The variance of immunoprecipitation, sample loading, and/or immunoblotting in these experiments in the aggregate was established at ≤10%. The number of β2-adrenergic receptors was determined by radioligand binding. Intact A431 cell clones were incubated with 0.5 nm[125I]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP; NEN Life Science Products) in the presence or absence of 10 μm propranolol at 23 °C for 90 min. The incubation buffer contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl. The affinity constants for ICYP and isoproterenol (Sigma) binding were determined using crude membrane fractions (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant for ICYP binding was calculated by Scatchard plot analysis with ICYP concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 nm(2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Two days prior to the analysis of agonist-induced desensitization, the A431 cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 25,000–50,000 cells/well. Details of the desensitization protocol have been published elsewhere (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For the actual assay, cells were washed and challenged with or without 1 μm isoproterenol for 30 min at 37 °C. At the end of the first challenge, the cells were washed three times and then incubated in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mm Ro-20-1724 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) and 0.5 units/ml adenosine deaminase (Sigma) for 5 min prior to and again following a second challenge with 1 μm agonist. For resensitization, the cells challenged with isoproterenol for 30 min prior were washed free of agonist and maintained in fresh buffer for an additional 30–60 min. Five minutes before the second challenge of the agonist, cells were incubated again in the presence of Ro-20-1724 and adenosine deaminase. The amount of cyclic AMP accumulated by cells in response to agonist was measured in the naive cells (activation), in the cells treated with agonist for 30 min prior to a second challenge with isoproterenol (desensitized), and in cells treated with agonist for 30 min prior to a second challenge with isoproterenol and washed free of agonist for 30–60 min (resensitized). The cyclic AMP accumulated by the cells was determined as described (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Pippig S. Andexinger S. Danie K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). “0% desensitization” denotes a cyclic AMP response to a second challenge with agonist that is equivalent in magnitude to that obtained in naive cells in response to the first challenge. “100% desensitization” represents the maximal level of desensitization obtained by a 30-min pre-incubation of the cells with isoproterenol. Cells were preincubated in the presence or absence of protein phosphatase inhibitors, such as FK506 (Fujisawa USA, Deerfield, IL) and calyculin A (Boehringer Mannheim) for 15 min prior to the addition of the agonist. Each inhibitor was included throughout the incubation for desensitization, washout, and resensitization, as described elsewhere (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Each of the experimental protocols were performed, as indicated, with three to five separate A431 clones. The values presented are means ± S.E., and the autoradiograms are representative examples of data. Agonist-induced desensitization of G-protein-linked receptors, typified by studies of the β-adrenergic receptor, is sensitive to chemical inhibitors of protein phosphatases (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Inhibition of PP2A and PP2B leads to enhanced desensitization, reflecting an attenuation of the recovery phase (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Direct analysis of the association of β-adrenergic receptors with protein phosphatases 2A and 2B was probed by immunoprecipitating β-adrenergic receptors from detergent extracts from human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells and exploring the nature of associated proteins either by immunoblotting or by direct assay of phosphatase activity of the immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 A). In the absence of exposure to the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, immunoprecipitates of β-adrenergic receptors subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with antibodies to PP2Bα reveal the presence of phosphatase PP2B in association with the β-adrenergic receptor (0-min desensitization time, Fig.1 A). A characteristic doublet band of PP2B with molecular mass values of 57 and 61 kDa are detected with antibodies to PP2Bα, whereas staining either with a non-immune serum or with antibodies to unrelated antigens reveals no such bands (data not shown). Challenging A431 cells with isoproterenol stimulates agonist-induced desensitization (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 21Pippig S. Andexinger S. Danie K. Puzicha M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3201-3208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wang H.-y. Berrios M. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and results in a decline of PP2B associated with the β-adrenergic receptors that was prominent within 5 min of the challenge (Fig. 1 A). Within 10 min of agonist challenge, the amount of PP2B associated with β-adrenergic receptors began to return toward normal. By 30 min of challenge with isoproterenol, levels of PP2B associated with β-adrenergic receptors nearly doubled compared with that observed in the naive cells (Fig. 1 A). Use of the calmodulin-overlay assay as an alternative to detect the 57- and 62-kDa forms of phosphatase PP2B confirms (i) the association of PP2B with β-adrenergic receptors in the naive cells, (ii) the decline in PP2B associated with the receptor upon early challenge with agonist, and (iii) the enhanced association of PP2B with the receptor at 30 min, a time when recovery from agonist-induced desensitization occurs (1Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar,2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The relative levels of PP2A, PP2B, and protein kinase A (PKA) associated with β-adrenergic receptors was determined in A431 cells using this same strategy (Fig. 2). Summation of data from several independent assays confirms the results displayed in Fig. 1, i.e. PP2B associates with β-adrenergic receptors in the naive cells, is lost transiently early during agonist treatment, and associates in greater abundance as desensitization progresses to 30 min. Unlike the case for PP2B determinations, antibodies capable of detecting either PP2A or protein kinase A were found to be unsuitable for the purpose of detection of either protein in the immunoprecipitates. For measurement of PP2A associated with β-adrenergic receptors, PP2A activity was measured in immunoprecipitates of β-adrenergic receptors using [32P]phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase aas a substrate. PP2A activity was readily measurable in immunoprecipitates of β-adrenergic receptors from naive cells. Upon challenge with agonist, the amount of PP2A associated with the receptor declined by 20–25% at 5 min, and returned to control pre-challenge levels within the next 5 min, and remained rather constant over the next 20 min. Thus, both protein phosphatases PP2A and PP2B associate with the β-adrenergic receptors in naive cells and display a partial dissociation from the receptor early after challenge with an agonist. For PP2A the agonist-induced dissociation is transient and returns to normal, while PP2B actually displays increased association with the receptor as the time course continues to the 30-min challenge with agonist. For protein kinase A, kinase activity is found in association with β-adrenergic receptors of naive A431 cells and increases approximately 3-fold over control levels at 30 min after challenge with isoproterenol (Fig. 2). In an effort to explore further the role of PP2A and PP2B in agonist-induced desensitization and resensitization, stable transfectant clones of A431 cells were created that harbor pLNCX antisense RNA-expressing vectors (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). pLNCX antisense constructs, characterized previously (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 23Wang H.-y. Berrios M. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), were engineered to include 30-base pair sequences antisense to the catalytic subunit of either PP2A or PP2B. Each of these antisense expression vectors is driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter, harbors the neomycin resistance gene, and stably transfects clones of A431 cells, selected with the neomycin analog G418 (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Galvin-Parton P. Chen J.-F. Wang H.-y. Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Adolph K.W. Methods in Molecular Genetics: Approaches in Human Genetics. Academic Press, NY1995Google Scholar). Clones stably transfected with pLNCXASPP2A vector display an 85–95% suppression of PP2A levels (Fig.3). Glycogen phosphorylase ais dephosphorylated by either protein phosphatase type 1 or PP2A. Using radiolabeled [32P]phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylasea as a substrate, the sum of these two activities in whole-cell extracts was found to be reduced >75% in the clones stably transfected with the pLNCXASPP2A vector (data not shown). The suppression of PP2A expression (immunoblotting) by antisense RNA and corresponding loss of activity suggest that PP2A is largely responsible for the read-out using phosphorylase a as the substrate for detection of PP2A in immunoprecipitates of β-adrenergic receptors from A431 cells (Fig. 3). Similar clones deficient in PP2B expression were sought using the pLNCXASPP2B form of the vector, with surprising results. Despite considerable experience with pLNCXAS constructs to suppress the expression of a variety of targets (2Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 25Galvin-Parton P. Chen J.-F. Wang H.-y. Moxham C.M. Malbon C.C. Adolph K.W. Methods in Molecular Genetics: Approaches in Human Genetics. Academic Press, NY1995Google Scholar, 26Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we were unable to identify clones in which PP2B levels are suppressed in excess of 50–60% even after several independent rounds of transfection (Fig.3). This observation leads us to speculate that suppression of PP2B beyond the 50–60% range may not be compatible with cell viability. Alternatively, some PP2B isoform not sensitive to the antisense RNA may be expressed in A431 cells. Notably, the growth rate of the stably transfected A431 cell clones with 50% the complement of PP2B was reduced by severalfold. Assay of PP2B activity in whole-cell extracts of the PP2B-deficient clones was performed, and the amount of PP2B activity was found to be similarly reduced to about 50–60% of the control levels (data not shown). Agonist-induced desensitization was measured in the A431 clones stably transfected to suppress either PP2A or PP2B. The availability of chemical inhibitors for either PP2A or PP2B as well as clones in which levels of expression of either PP2A or PP2B are reduced provided two complementary strategies with which to study the functional significance of protein phosphatases PP2A and PP2B in agonist-induced desensitization. The amount of desensitization measured in either the clones expressing the empty vector or control A431 cells was set at 100% for these studies. A431 clones deficient in PP2A display a modest increase in the amount of agonist-induced desensitization in response to a challenge with 10 μm isoproterenol, 137 ± 09% of the control levels (mean ± S.E.; n = 4). Treating cells with 10 nm calyculin A, a selective inhibitor for PP2A, yields agonist-induced desensitization, which is unaltered (105 ± 12%, mean ± S.E.; n = 4). The optimal concentration (100 nm) of calyculin A insuring maximal inhibition of PP2A activity could not be employed in the current studies. Calyculin A at 100 nm provoked cell death and detachment of the A431 cells. Thus, suppression of PP2A expression leads to a modest increase in the amount of desensitization, whereas partial inhibition of PP2A with 10 nm calyculin does not alter the extent of the desensitization. A431 cells lacking >50% of the PP2B complement display normal levels of desensitization, 92 ± 8% of control levels (mean ± S.E.; n = 4). Treating cells with the PP2B inhibitor FK506 (100 ng/ml), in contrast, more than doubles (210 ± 06%, mean ± S.E.; n = 4) the amount of agonist-induced desensitization over that observed in the control, untreated A431 cells. The inability of the antisense RNA to suppress the expression of PP2B more than 50–60%, whereas the FK506 effectively blocks PP2B activity under the same conditions, provides an explanation for the apparent dichotomy in the inhibitor versus antisense data. In the desensitization paradigm employed for these studies, loss or inhibition of PP2A enhances the extent of desensitization only slightly, whereas inhibition of PP2B enhances markedly the extent of agonist-induced desensitization. Earlier studies implicated PP2A in agonist-induced desensitization (1Hausdorff W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Since protein phosphatases would likely have a more prominent role in re-sensitization rather than desensitization per se, the re-sensitization of the cyclic AMP response of A431 cells following a challenge with 1 μm isoproterenol was evaluated in cells for which levels of PP2A and PP2B"
https://openalex.org/W2110603899,"A 126-base region of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 3′-untranslated region, which we identified as the hypoxia stability region, forms seven hypoxia-inducible RNA-protein complexes with apparent molecular masses ranging from 40 to 90 kDa in RNA-UV-cross-linking assays. In this study, we show that proteins that form the 60-kDa RNA-protein complex with the hypoxia stability region were present in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. We purified the protein associated in the 60-kDa complex and identified it as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L) by protein sequencing. Removal of hnRNP L by immunoprecipitation specifically abolished formation of the 60-kDa complex. Synthetic deoxyribonucleotide competition studies defined the RNA-binding site of hnRNP L as a 21-base-long sequence, 5′-CACCCACCCACAUACAUACAU-3′. Immunoprecipitation of hnRNP L followed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that hnRNP L specifically interacts with VEGF mRNA in hypoxic cells in vivo. Furthermore, when M21 cells transfected with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide to the hnRNP L RNA-binding site, the VEGF mRNA half-life was significantly reduced under hypoxic conditions. Thus, we propose that specific association of hnRNP L with VEGF mRNA under hypoxia may play an important role in hypoxia-induced post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF mRNA expression.

Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The turnover rate of a given mRNA can be determined by interactions of trans-acting factors with specific cis-element located within 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) (9Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Many labile mRNAs, including those that encode lymphokines, cytokines, transcription factors, and proto-oncogenes, contain AU-rich elements (AREs) in their 3′-UTR (9Ross J. Microbiol.

Identification of the interaction of AREs with trans-acting proteins has been the first step in understanding the molecular regulation of mRNA stability (9Ross J. Microbiol.

However, the mechanisms of how these proteins affect mRNA turnover remains unclear.Our previous work identified a 126-base hypoxia stability region (HSR) in human VEGF 3′-UTR that is critical for the stabilization of VEGF mRNA under hypoxia (21Claffey K.P. Shih S.-C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This region is able to form seven hypoxia-inducible mRNA-protein complexes (21Claffey K.P. Shih S.-C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Here we report hnRNP L as a protein that interacts with the VEGF HSR and forms a hypoxia-inducible 60-kDa RNA-hnRNP L complex. The cytoplasmic hnRNP L specifically interacted with VEGF mRNA in hypoxic cells in vivo and regulated VEGF mRNA stability. Thus, we propose that a specific interaction of hnRNP L with VEGF mRNA may play an important role in hypoxia-induced post-transcriptional regulation of human VEGF mRNA stability.DISCUSSIONWith a half-life of only 30–45 min under normal growth conditions (6Shima D.T.

The mechanisms whereby normally labile mRNAs are stabilized by stimuli such as hypoxia, growth stimulation, and viral infection are unclear. On the basis of RNA-binding and UV cross-linking, the interaction of specific cellular proteins with mRNAs have been shown to be altered in response to stimuli, which correlates with changes in mRNA stability (9Ross J.

Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that mRNA turnover is mediated principally through mRNA-binding proteins that specifically recognize AREs and other sequence motifs.Our previous work demonstrated a 126-base HSR in human VEGF 3′-UTR, which is responsible for hypoxia-induced VEGF mRNA stability and forms seven hypoxia-inducible RNA-protein complexes with M21 human melanoma cell extracts (21Claffey K.P. Shih S.-C. Mullen A. Dziennis S. Cusick J.L. Abrams K.R. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that the protein that forms the 60-kDa RNA-protein complex is present in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 1). Protein sequencing and immunodepletion studies identified that protein in the 60-kDa RNA-protein complex as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNP L) (Figs. 3 and 4). The specific mRNA binding site of hnRNP L was identified as 3′-CACCCACCCACAUACAUACAU-5′, a 21-base single-stranded element, which is unique to human and bovine VEGF 3′-UTR sequences (Figs. 5 and 6). Immunoprecipitation of hnRNP L followed by RT-PCR showed that hnRNP L specifically interacted with VEGF mRNA in hypoxic cells in vivo (Fig. 7). Furthermore, when M21 cells were transfected with antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide to the hnRNP L RNA-binding site, the hypoxia-induced VEGF mRNA half-life decreased from 53 ± 4.1 min to 32 ± 5.7 min (Fig. 8). This study identifies for the first time that hnRNP L as a protein present in human cells that is capable of interacting with VEGF mRNA 3′-UTR and is functionally involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF mRNA under hypoxic conditions.It is well documented that unstable mRNAs containing AREs generally consists of either scattered AUUUA pentanucleotides, contiguous AUUUA repeats, nonamer motif UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A), or a stretch of AU residues lacking either motif (10Chen C.-Y.A.

These AREs interact with cytoplasmic and/or nuclear proteins and usually form ARE-protein complex with average molecular mass less than 40-kDa (10Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem.

The VEGF HSR is also a highly AU-rich element (43% A and 41% U) and contains one AUUUA pentanucleotide as well as two stretches of AU residues. However, interaction of the HSR with cellular proteins formed seven RNA-protein complexes with higher molecular masses (ranging from 40 to 90 kDa). The HSR also formed same protein complexes with five other cell lines we tested (data not shown), indicating that those RNA-binding proteins are common proteins to different cell lines. The 3′-UTRs of two other hypoxia up-regulated genes, erythropoietin (25Rondon I.J. MacMillan L.A. Beckman B.S. Goldberg M.A. Schneider T. Bunn H.F. Malter J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16594-16598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tyrosine hydroxylase (26Czyzyk-Krzeska M.F. Dominski Z. Kole R. Millhorn D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9940-9945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), interacted with mRNA-binding proteins with apparent molecular masses ranging from 66 to 140 kDa. However, the VEGF HSR and the 3′-UTRs of both erythropoietin and tyrosine hydroxylase lack significant homology. Moreover, the interaction site for a 66-kDa protein to tyrosine hydroxylase 3′-UTR is different from the hnRNP L mRNA binding site. Thus, VEGF HSR-binding proteins may be distinct from those that recognize other hypoxia-inducible genes.Studies of rat VEGF mRNA demonstrated a 600-base region covering nucleotides 1251–1877 in the 3′-UTR required for rat VEGF mRNA stability (27Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25492-25497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 28Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, little homology exists between the human VEGF HSR sequence and the rat 600-base region. In addition, the protein complexes observed by EMSA in the rat ARE-binding proteins are 17, 28, and 34 kDa (27Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25492-25497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 28Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), none of which correlate to the hypoxia-induced complexes described here. Recent studies identified that the 34-kDa rat VEGF ARE-binding protein as HuR, which interacted with a 45-base element of rat VEGF 3′-UTR and stabilized the mRNA under hypoxia (28Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This element is also present in the human 3′-UTR covering nucleotides 1682–1726 3′ to the translation stop codon, a region close to the poly(A) tail. Taken together, these studies suggest that there are a variety of mRNA-binding proteins present in cells, and the regulation of mRNA turnover probably depends on the mRNA sequences, the metabolic and activation state of the cells, and the regulation of the RNA-binding protein expression and distribution.The hnRNPs are a family of abundant nuclear proteins that are involved in pre-mRNA processing and splicing (22Pinol-Roma S. Swanson M.S. Gall J.G. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2575-2587Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 23Liu X. Mertz J.E.

Biochem. 1993; 62: 289-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). The hnRNP L differs from other ARE-binding hnRNPs in that hnRNP A, hnRNP C, and hnRNP D interact with the AUUUA motif and may participate in mRNA destabilization (15Vakalopoulou E. Schaack J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3355-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 29Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2460-2466Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 30Hamilton B.J.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4870-4876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas hnRNP L interacts with a unique sequence in the human and bovine VEGF 3′-UTR (3′-CACCCACCCACAUACAUACAU-5′) and probably has a predominant stabilization effect. In support of this hypothesis, hypoxia substantially increased hnRNP L in both nucleus and cytoplasmic compartments, whereas hnRNP C was dramatically decreased to undetectable levels in the cytoplasm after a 24-h hypoxic treatment. This differential regulation of hnRNPs under hypoxia, a decrease in the hnRNP C and an increase in the hnRNP L in cytoplasm, may define a key balance regulating mRNA metabolism during metabolic stress. The 21-base-long mRNA binding site of hnRNP L is juxtaposed to the only AUUUA pentanucleotide and a long stretch of AU residues. Therefore, it is possible that the interaction of hnRNP L may block other proteins such as hnRNP C from interacting with and destabilizing the mRNA. Furthermore, under hypoxia we observe increased expression of hnRNP L and the specific interaction of hnRNP L with VEGF mRNA in vivo, along with reduced VEGF mRNA stability observed with transfection of antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide to the hnRNP L binding site. Thus, hnRNP L appears to plays a significant role in the post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF mRNA during hypoxic stress.Using Western blot analysis, anti-hnRNP L monoclonal antibody identified three proteins with apparent molecular masses of 66, 60, and 56 kDa, with the cytoplasmic 56-kDa protein being the most strongly up-regulated by hypoxia. Since there was only one RNA-hnRNP L complex formed in RNA-UVXL, it is unlikely that all three hnRNP L isoforms interacted with HSR. Interaction of hnRNP L with the entire 21-base binding site would account for approximately 6 kDa of the 60-kDa HSR-hnRNP L complex after UV-cross-linking and RNase treatment. Thus, it is reasonable to predict that the 56-kDa hnRNP L isoform is the molecule that is specifically interacting with HSR. Comparing the minor induction of hnRNP L levels in hypoxia by Western blot to the marked increase of hnRNP L and HSR interaction in RNA-UVXL assays leads us to speculate that post-translational modification of hnRNP L isoforms may promote a higher hnRNP L binding affinity to HSR under hypoxia, an interesting possibility we are currently investigating.To effectively define the complex cellular mechanisms that control mRNA stability such as VEGF, identification of the mRNA-binding proteins is required. Purification and identification of hnRNP L protein as one of the VEGF mRNA-binding proteins is a significant step in defining the molecular regulation of VEGF mRNA expression under hypoxic conditions. Here we have detailed the characterization of hnRNP L as one of the hypoxia-inducible RNA-binding proteins that recognizes a specific region of the human VEGF HSR. The potential signaling mechanisms that regulate hnRNP L isoform expression and association with VEGF mRNA can now be investigated in detail. Since a complex of at least seven proteins bind to VEGF HSR, interaction of hnRNP L with other proteins in the same complex may be required to protect the VEGF mRNA from nuclease digestion. Interference of hnRNP L binding to VEGF HSR significantly affected VEGF mRNA expression in hypoxia, indicating that it plays an important and novel role in VEGF expression under hypoxic stress. Identification of the other mRNA-binding proteins that recognize VEGF HSR, how they are regulated, and their potential interaction with hnRNP L will be necessary to get a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms resulting in hypoxia-mediated VEGF mRNA stability.

Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, especially modulation of mRNA stability, has been shown to play a major role in gene expression (9Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The turnover rate of a given mRNA can be determined by interactions of trans-acting factors with specific cis-element located within 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) (9Ross J. Microbiol.

https://openalex.org/W2094747541,"A recent proposal for the formation of functionally active rhodopsin has placed critical importance on a movement of one of its transmembrane helices (Farrens, D. L., Altenbach, C., Yang, K., Hubbell, W. L., and Khorana, H. G. (1996) Science 274, 768–770). We investigated this hypothesis using a series of eight rhodopsin mutants containing single reactive cysteine residues in the region (helix F) where movement was previously detected. The cysteine mutants were studied in two ways, by measuring their reactivity to a cysteine-specific reagent (PyMPO-maleimide), and by labeling the cysteines with a fluorescent label (monobromobimane) followed by fluorescence spectroscopic analysis. The chemical reactivity data showed sequence-specific variations in reactivity for the mutants in the dark state, resulting in a pattern suggestive of an α helix. Interestingly, only upon photoactivation to the MII form did residues found on the inner “face” of this helix react with the PyMPO-maleimide. The ability of the dark state mutants to react with the fluorescent label monobromobimane followed a similar pattern. Furthermore, fluorescence measurements indicate that a bimane label on the inner face of the helix (at V250C) detects changes in the polarity of its environment and accessibility to a fluorescence quenching agent upon MII formation. Viewed together, the data provide further direct evidence that rhodopsin activation involves a conformational change at helix F. A recent proposal for the formation of functionally active rhodopsin has placed critical importance on a movement of one of its transmembrane helices (Farrens, D.

The chemical reactivity data showed sequence-specific variations in reactivity for the mutants in the dark state, resulting in a pattern suggestive of an α helix. Interestingly, only upon photoactivation to the MII form did residues found on the inner “face” of this helix react with the PyMPO-maleimide. The ability of the dark state mutants to react with the fluorescent label monobromobimane followed a similar pattern. Furthermore, fluorescence measurements indicate that a bimane label on the inner face of the helix (at V250C) detects changes in the polarity of its environment and accessibility to a fluorescence quenching agent upon MII formation. Viewed together, the data provide further direct evidence that rhodopsin activation involves a conformational change at helix F. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; MES, 2-(4-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; DM, dodecyl maltoside; PyMPO, N-(maleimidylethyl)-5-((4-methoxyphenyl)oxazol-2-yl)pyridi-nium methanesulfonate; MII, metarhodopsin II; mBBr, monobromobimane; SDSL, site-directed spin labeling. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; MES, 2-(4-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; DM, dodecyl maltoside; PyMPO, N-(maleimidylethyl)-5-((4-methoxyphenyl)oxazol-2-yl)pyridi-nium methanesulfonate; MII, metarhodopsin II; mBBr, monobromobimane; SDSL, site-directed spin labeling. are membrane proteins that act as the initial input stages in many sensory systems. Arguably, the best characterized GPCR is the bovine visual photoreceptor, rhodopsin (1Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately half the amino acids in rhodopsin are found in a cluster of seven membrane-spanning helices (see Fig. 1). The rhodopsin “antagonist” (11-cis-retinal) is covalently bound in the middle of these helices, inactivating the protein in the dark state. Rhodopsin becomes activated when it absorbs light (absorption λmax = 500 nm) and the retinal is converted to an all-trans form (2Wald G. Nature. 1968; 219: 800-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). This activated rhodopsin species, called MII (λmax = 380 nm), is the only form of rhodopsin that can readily bind and activate the G-protein transducin and initiate the subsequent biochemical events involved in vision. A central question remains as to why only the MII form of rhodopsin can bind and activate transducin. It has been noted that transducin can be activated by peptide analogues of the cytoplasmic loops of rhodopsin (3Konig B. Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Kahlert M. Hargrave P.A. Hofmann K.P. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), suggesting that dark state rhodopsin is inactive because the loops are physically inaccessible. Thus, a reasonable hypothesis is that MII formation involves some kind of conformational change that exposes the cytoplasmic loops and allows transducin to bind and become activated. Recently, the nature of these conformational changes has been studied by Khorana, Hubbell, and co-workers using an approach called site-directed spin labeling (SDSL). Briefly, their SDSL studies involved constructing mutant rhodopsin proteins with unique reactive cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic domain in loops C-D and E-F (4Ridge K.D. Zhang C. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8804-8811Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar,5Yang K. Farrens D.L. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12464-12469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), labeling these cysteines with a methanethiosulfonate spin label, and then measuring the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum of the labeled mutant in the dark state and MII state. By assessing the mobility and environment of each spin label, a probable structure of the cytoplasmic domain could be proposed. Interestingly, their experiments suggested that many conformational changes in MII occur near helix F (6Farahbakhsh Z.T. Ridge K.D. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8812-8819Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 7Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). 2Note that results from SDSL studies of helices A and B have not yet been reported, although such studies are currently under way (W. L. Hubbell and H. G. Khorana, personal communication). 2Note that results from SDSL studies of helices A and B have not yet been reported, although such studies are currently under way (W. L. Hubbell and H. G. Khorana, personal communication). A model was proposed, suggesting MII formation involves an outward movement of this helix away from helix C (7Altenbach C. Yang K. Farrens D.L. Farahbakhsh Z. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12470-12478Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 8Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The potential importance of this movement was implied from observations that linking helix F to helix C (either by disulfide bonds or metal chelating agents) abolished transducin activation (8Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 9Sheikh S.P. Zvyaga T.A. Lichtarge O. Sakmar T.P. Bourne H.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a wealth of data is accumulating that suggests a movement of this helix plays a crucial role in forming the active, signaling state in other GPCRs. In this paper, we directly tested the hypothesis that helix F movement occurs in rhodopsin upon MII formation. We measured differences in chemical reactivity of cysteines engineered into this helix, and studied fluorescence labels attached to these cysteines. Our results clearly detect a conformational change in helix F, and the results are consistent with a previously proposed movement of this helix upon rhodopsin activation. Finally, the methods we describe here can be broadly applied to studies of other GPCRs that may be available in limited quantities. All buffers were purchased from either Fisher or Sigma, except the spectroscopy grade HEPES that was purchased from United States Biochemical Corp. PyMPO-maleimide and mBBr were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). DM was purchased from Anatrace (Maumee, OH), and GBX red light filters from Eastman Kodak Corp. Polystyrene columns (2-ml bed volume) were purchased from Pierce. The 9-mer peptide corresponding to the rhodopsin C terminus was acquired from the Emory University Microchemical Facility (Atlanta, GA). The 1D4 antibody was purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). 11-cis-Retinal was a generous gift from Dr. R. Crouch (Medical University of South Carolina and the National Eye Institute).l-Cysteine was purchased from Sigma, and 4 × 4-mm and 3 × 3-mm fluorescence cuvettes were purchased from Uvonics (Plainview, NY). The 298–435-nm (λmax = 355 nm) band pass filter and the >310-nm and >470-nm long pass filters were purchased from Oriel (Stratford, CT). All materials for gel electrophoresis were purchased from Hoefer (San Francisco, CA) and Fischer Biotech (Pittsburgh, PA), and the 30% acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution (37.5:1) was purchased from Bio-Rad. The definitions of the buffers used are as follows: PBSSC (0.137m NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 8 mmNa2HPO4), Buffer A (1% DM, PBSSC (pH 7.2)), Buffer B (0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 7.6), 0.5m NaCl, 0.02% NaN3), Buffer C (2 mm ATP, 0.1% DM, 1 m NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2), Buffer D (0.05% DM, PBSSC (pH 7.0)), Buffer E (0.05% DM, MES (pH 6.0)), and Buffer F (5 mm MES, 50 mm HEPES, 0.025% DM, 1 mm EDTA). The single cysteine rhodopsin mutants used in the present study have been described previously (5Yang K. Farrens D.L. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12464-12469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mutants were constructed in the plasmid PMT4, containing a synthetic gene of rhodopsin in which the potentially reactive “background” cysteine residues 140, 316, 322, and 323 were replaced with serines (10Resek J.F. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Resek J.F. Farrens D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The mutant rhodopsin proteins were transiently expressed in COS cells using the DEAE-dextran method (12Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 13Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 14Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, the cells were harvested and stored at −80 °C. All steps in this procedure were in dark room conditions under filtered red light. Purification of mutant rhodopsins followed previously described procedures (8Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 11Resek J.F. Farrens D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) except that samples were purified using small disposable polystyrene columns. Before purification, the columns were prepared by adding 400 μl of the 1D4-coupled antibody bead slurry (a 50% bead v:v slurry). The columns were stored in Buffer B at 4 °C and primed with 5 ml of Buffer A before use. For a typical purification, the harvested cells from five plates of transfected COS-1 cells were thawed in an ice bath for 30 min, then solubilized in 5 ml of Buffer A + 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and placed on a nutator at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were then centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 10 min, and the supernatant removed. This was followed by a second centrifugation for 15 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant from this second centrifugation was applied to the 1D4 columns and allowed to flow through by gravity. The pass-through was collected and reapplied to the column a total of five times. The columns were next washed with 5 ml of Buffer C, then with 40 ml of Buffer D, followed by another 40 ml of Buffer E. During the last 5 ml of washing with Buffer E, a 27-gauge 0.5-inch needle was attached to the column to slow the flow rate further. The samples were eluted in 200-μl fractions of Buffer E containing 250 μm 9-mer peptide. A spectrum of each elution sample was measured using a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer, and the purified samples were then stored at either 4 °C in the dark or at −80 °C for longer term storage. The reactivity of the rhodopsin cysteine mutants in the dark state was probed by reacting the samples (at pH 6.8 in 0.05% DM, 10 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA) with a 50-fold excess of PyMPO (Fig. 2 A). The reaction was carried out for 16 h at room temperature while the mutants were bound to the 1D4 antibody columns. This approach allowed extensive washing of the beads to remove any unreacted PyMPO label. After elution from the column, PyMPO labeling was determined for each mutant by comparing its absorption spectrum with an “ideal” rod outer segment (ROS) rhodopsin spectrum. The ideal rhodopsin spectrum was then subtracted from that of the labeled sample, allowing the amount of attached PyMPO to be determined from the remaining absorbance at 380 nm (using an extinction coefficient of 23,000 for PyMPO). Three μg of mutant rhodopsin in 70 μl was reacted with 20-fold excess PyMPO for 1 min at pH 7.2 (100 mm HEPES and 0.05% DM) and 4 °C in either the dark (−) or MII (+) state (bleached for 30 s). The reaction was then quenched by the addition of l-cysteine to a 1 mm final concentration. Samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amount of label incorporation was determined using a Bio-Rad Gel Documentation Instrument by comparing the signal intensity with that of a series of PyMPO-labeled rhodopsin standards of known concentration. The background mutant, θ (containing no reactive cysteine residues) (10Resek J.F. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,11Resek J.F. Farrens D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7643-7647Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), was used to show specificity in PyMPO labeling. After visualization of the gels, the samples were subjected to Coomassie staining to check for equal distribution of protein in each of the sample wells. Labeling of the cysteine mutants with mBBr (Fig.2 B) was carried out with the samples bound to the 1D4 beads, similar to previous methods (10Resek J.F. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In brief, the 1D4 beads in Buffer C were incubated with each solubilized mutant in 15-ml Falcon tubes at 4 °C on a nutator for 5 h. The suspension was then centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 2.5 min and the supernatant removed. A series of washes were performed by adding the respective buffer to the rhodopsin-bound 1D4 beads, followed by removal of the supernatant as described above. The washes were as follows: 10 ml of Buffer D, 10 ml of Buffer D (10-min incubation), 10 ml of Buffer F (10-min incubation). The 1D4-bound mutants were then incubated with a 20-fold excess of mBBr in Buffer F at pH 6.7 for 18 h at 4 °C. Before elution from the column, the reaction of the mBBr with samples was quenched by the addition of a 20-fold excess of l-cysteine. The beads were then washed with 12 ml of Buffer F containing varying amounts of detergent (0.025%, 0.2%, 0.2%, and 0.025% DM) before continuing with the normal purification protocol (see above). The mBBr incorporation in each mutant was determined by comparison to a standard curve of mBBr reacted with l-cysteine. Covalent attachment of the labels was verified by subjecting the samples to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis visualized by UV irradiation. The effect of labeling on each mutant was assessed by measuring its absorption spectra and rates of retinal release from MII. Spectra were measured using a Shimadzu 1601 UV-visible spectrophotometer both in the dark state and in the MII state after photoconverting the samples for 30 s with >500 nm light using a 150-watt fiber optic illuminator (Techni-Quip Corp). The MII stability was assessed by measuring the time course of retinal release after MII formation (14Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) using a Photon Technologies QM-1 steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometer. Each measurement was carried out at 20 °C using 125 μl of a 0.25 μm mutant sample in 5 mm MES, pH 6.0 and 0.05% DM. After photoconverting the samples to the MII state (see above), the retinal release measurements were carried out by exciting the sample for 3 s (excitation wavelength = 295 nm, 1/4-nm bandpass slit setting) then blocking the excitation beam for 42 s, to avoid photobleaching the samples. This cycle was repeated for 90 min during each measurement. The sensitivity of the measurements was enhanced by removing the emission monochromator and monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence emission through a combination of one >310-nm long pass filter and a 298–435-nm band pass filter. Results were analyzed, using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific) to obtain the t 1/2 values for retinal release. All fits had r 2 values ranging from 0.99 to 1.1. Excitation scans were carried out using the PTI QM-1 fluorescence spectrometer described above. The excitation bandpass was 1/3 nm, and the fluorescence emission was detected through two >470-nm long pass filters (Oriel). Each measurement used 200 μl of a 2-μg sample (250 nm). The samples were first scanned in the dark state and then again after photoconverting to the MII state. Two such scans from 300 to 450 nm (step size = 1 nm, integration time of 0.25 s) were averaged for each mutant, and two separate sample preparations were measured. Under these conditions, less than 2% bleaching of the samples was observed as judged by UV-visible spectroscopy. Excitation maxima were determined by importing the spectra into the program LabCalc (Galactic Industries), and then taking the first derivative of the spectra, using a 21-point window. The peak maximum was taken to be the crossover point, i.e. the wavelength where the first derivative crossed zero, going from positive to negative. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of the bimane-labeled rhodopsin mutants were carried out using a PTI Laserstrobe fluorescence lifetime instrument. Measurements were taken at 10 °C, using 381-nm excitation pulses (full width at half maximum (FWHM) ∼1.5 ns) while monitoring the emission through two long pass filters (>450 nm and >470 nm). Measurements used 225 μl of a 1 μm sample placed in a 4-mm black jacketed cuvette, and represented three averages of 5 shots per point, collected in 100 channels. Under these conditions, each measurement took less than 5 min and resulted in less than 2% of the rhodopsin spectra being converted to MII, as judged by UV-visible spectroscopy. Fluorescence lifetimes of the samples in the MII state were measured as described above, except the samples were irradiated with >490 nm light for 1 min before measurement. The fluorescence decays were fit to a single exponential using the commercial PTI program. Note that less than 6% of the sample had decayed to opsin and free retinal during the 5-min duration of the measurement, as calculated from the retinal release rates at 10 °C. Steady-state fluorescence quenching measurements were carried out using the PTI steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometer and KI as the fluorescence quenching agent. Measurements used 125 μl of a 0.25 μmsample in a 2-mm cuvette. Excitation was set at 380 nm using 1/3-nm bandpass setting. The emission was monitored through two >470-nm long pass filters. Five separate samples with different KI concentrations (ranging from 0 to 25 mm) were measured. The salt concentration in the sample was kept constant at 25 mm by the addition of a corresponding amount of KCl, and Na2S2O3 was added to 0.10 mm to inhibit formation of I3−. Measurements of the MII state were carried out after bleaching the samples with >490 nm light for 30 s, as described previously. The data were plotted as fluorescence intensity versusconcentration of quenching agent, to calculate the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, K SV. FoF=1+KSV·[Q]Equation 1 Fo and F are the intensities of the fluorescence before and after addition of the KI quenching agent (Q), respectively. The plots were analyzed using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). The K SV values thus obtained were then used with the measured fluorescence lifetimes (τ0) to determine the bimolecular quenching constant,kq, from the following form of the Stern-Volmer relationship (15Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). FoF=1+kq·τ0·[Q]Equation 2 In the present paper, we have used rhodopsin mutants containing unique, single cysteine residues in the cytoplasmic end of helix F to investigate whether movement occurs in this region of the protein upon MII formation. The mutants (K248C–I256C, shown in Fig. 1) were previously constructed (5Yang K. Farrens D.L. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12464-12469Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) in the “background” mutant (θ) containing no other reactive cysteine residues (10Resek J.F. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The mutants were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells and purified using an immunoaffinity procedure (12Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 13Karnik S.S. Ridge K.D. Bhattacharya S. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Similar to the previous study, we found these mutants are all wild-type-like, as judged by their ability to bind 11-cis-retinal and form a 500-nm absorbing species. Further, each mutant could be obtained in the correctly folded form, as judged by theA 280 nm/A 500 nm ratio (which ranged from 1.6 to 1.8). The accessibility of the cysteine mutants K248C–I256C in dark state rhodopsin mutants was investigated using the cysteine-specific reagent PyMPO-maleimide (Fig.2 A). As anticipated, this large, rigid molecule demonstrated differences in its ability to penetrate and react with cysteine residues in sterically constrained regions of the protein (Fig. 3). The spectra of each PyMPO-labeled mutant (purified after reaction with for 16 h with a 50-fold excess of PyMPO while bound to the 1D4 column) is shown in Fig. 3 A, and a plot of the labeling efficiency is shown in Fig. 3 B. While several mutants (K248C, E249C, T251C, R252C, and I255C) showed a near one-to-one labeling efficiency with the PyMPO, several others (V250C,M253C and V254C,I256C) showed little to no reactivity. The reactivity of V250C with PyMPO in the MII state was explored further (described below). Mutant V250C, which showed almost no reactivity with PyMPO in the dark state, was next studied to see whether it might show increased reactivity in the MII state (Fig.4). Indeed, a dramatic increase in labeling of this residue was observed after the sample was converted to the MII state. In contrast, the control “background” mutant θ showed no reactivity toward the PyMPO either in the dark state or after photobleaching to the MII form. The extent of PyMPO labeling was determined to be one PyMPO per mutant V250C by comparison to a series of rhodopsin standards previously labeled with PyMPO (Fig. 4,B and C). The specificity of the PyMPO for residue V250C was established further by monitoring the time course of the labeling reaction (Fig. 4 D). The results from these experiments show that one PyMPO specifically reacts with the cysteine residue at V250C, and does so only upon MII formation. Note that, during the 5-min time span used in this labeling experiment, less than 3% of the sample has decayed from MII to opsin (calculated from at 1/2 for MII = 115 min at 4 °C; Ref.14Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The single cysteine mutants were next labeled with the cysteine-specific label monobromobimane for subsequent fluorescent spectroscopic studies. Monobromobimane was chosen because it is a relatively small label (approximately the size of a spin label or tryptophan residue) with a long fluorescence lifetime and high quantum yield. Additionally, monobromobimane is sensitive to changes in the polarity of the surrounding solvent (16Kosower E.M. Giniger R. Radkowsky A. Hebel D. Shusterman A. J. Phys. Chem. 1986; 90: 5552-5557Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The labeling efficiency for each mutant was determined by comparison to a “standard” graph of bimane (TableI). Mutants K248C through M252C could each be reacted with approximately one bimane label per protein. However, the labeling efficiencies of mutants I255C and I256C were much less than one label per protein, and consistent with the PyMPO labeling results, mutants M253C and V254C showed essentially no reactivity with the bimane label. Thus, the latter four mutants were not used in further analysis. Note that only ∼0.2 mBBr/protein were observed to react with the “background” cysteine-less mutant θ, consistent with previous reports showing little reactivity of θ with different cysteine-specific reagents (10Resek J.F. Farahbakhsh Z.T. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12025-12032Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Resek J.F. Farrens D. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab The effect of the bimane label on each mutant was characterized by measuring the labeled mutant's absorption spectra and rate of retinal release from the MII state. None of the absorption spectra for any of the mutants showed obvious differences with respect to wild-type rhodopsin in either the dark state or MII state (Table I). Furthermore, all of the bimane-labeled mutants displayed retinal release rates similar to wild-type rhodopsin (Table I). These results suggest that no dramatic perturbation of the protein structure was induced by the bimane label. Fluorescence excitation spectra were measured for the mutants to assess the environment surrounding each bimane label (Fig.5). The excitation and emission spectra of bimane are sensitive to the polarity of the surrounding solvent (16Kosower E.M. Giniger R. Radkowsky A. Hebel D. Shusterman A. J. Phys. Chem. 1986; 90: 5552-5557Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In our own experiments, 3S. E. Mansoor, H. S. Mchaourab, and D. L. Farrens, manuscript in preparation. we have found that the excitation maxima of bimane can range from 388 nm in water (dielectric constant = 78.5) to 371 nm in dioxane (dielectric constant ∼ 2.2). We used this property of bimane to monitor conformational changes by detecting shifts in the excitation maxima of the attached bimane labels. This approach has a key advantage for rhodopsin studies. During fluorescence excitation measurements, the samples are subjected to a minimal amount of measuring beam light, due to the small bandpass excitation slit settings used to obtain high wavelength resolution data. UV-visible spectra taken before and after the measurements showed less than 2% bleaching of the rhodopsin samples had occurred (data not shown). As can be seen in Table I, four of the mutants (K248C, E249C, T251C, and R252C) showed small changes in their bimane excitation maxima upon conversion to the MII form. (Note that the total fluorescence intensity was approximately 2-fold higher for all of the mutants in the MII state (not shown) because of a decrease in the fluorescence overlap and thus energy transfer of bimane with retinal.)

Treatment of cells with the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin inactivates steroid binding activity and increases the rate of GR turnover. We show here that a portion of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) exists as a molybdate-stabilized nNOS·hsp90 heterocomplex in the cytosolic fraction of human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably transfected with rat nNOS. Treatment of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with geldanamycin both decreases nNOS catalytic activity and increases the rate of nNOS turnover. Similarly, geldanamycin treatment of nNOS-expressing Sf9 cells partially inhibits nNOS activation by exogenous heme. Like the GR, purified heme-free apo-nNOS is activated by the DE52-retained fraction of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, which also assembles nNOS·hsp90 heterocomplexes. However, in contrast to the GR, heterocomplex assembly with hsp90 is not required for increased heme binding and nNOS activation in this cell-free system. We propose that, in vivo, where access by free heme is limited, the complete hsp90-based chaperone machinery is required for sustained opening of the heme binding cleft and nNOS activation, but in the heme-containing cell-free nNOS-activating system transient opening of the heme binding cleft without hsp90 is sufficient to facilitate heme binding.

The problem of providing access of ligands to hydrophobic binding sites situated in the interior of properly folded proteins is not unique to steroid and dioxin receptors. To test whether the hsp90-based chaperone machinery may play a more general role in opening up hydrophobic binding clefts, we have asked whether this system facilitates the entry of heme into its binding site in the interior of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS). The nitric-oxide synthases are cytochrome P450-type hemoproteins that catalyze the formation of nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline from l-arginine, O2, and NADPH (11Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4161) Google Scholar,12Marletta M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12231-12234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6627-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The heme-deficient monomer of NOS can be partially reconstituted in vitro in the presence of heme, tetrahydrobiopterin, and arginine to form the functional homodimer (18Baek K.J. Thiel B.A. Lucas S.

This is unlike the microsomal P450 cytochromes, which have not been successfully reconstituted with heme in vitro. We present here evidence that the activity of nNOS is regulated by the hsp90-based chaperone system and that hsp90 may facilitate heme binding in vivo. Since covalent alterations of the prosthetic heme and inactivation of P450 cytochromes are caused by drugs and xenobiotics as well as endogenous compounds (20Osawa Y. Pohl L.R. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1989; 2: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 21Olken N.M. Osawa Y. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14784-14791Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), reconstitution of NOS activity by heme may be an important process in regulation of the active enzyme. In the course of our studies, Garcia-Cardeña et al.(22Garcia-Cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) published that the endothelial isoform of NOS (eNOS) is activated by hsp90, and they were able to demonstrate direct activation of purified eNOS catalytic activity by purified hsp90 in the absence of added heme and other cofactors and without the co-chaperones of the hsp90-based chaperone machinery. On the basis of these in vitro results, they suggested that hsp90 may act as an allosteric modulator of eNOS. Although Garcia-Gardeña et al. (22Garcia-Cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) found that hsp90 was not co-immunoprecipitated with nNOS from lysates of cerebellum, we show here that a portion of nNOS in HEK 293 cytosol is recovered as a native nNOS·hsp90 heterocomplex and that nNOS activity is reduced by the hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin. As with the GR, the DE52-retained fraction of reticulocyte lysate can assemble heterocomplexes between hsp90 and purified apo-nNOS. This cell-free system also activates apo-nNOS to the specific activity of holo-nNOS, and activation is accompanied by increased heme association with the enzyme. However, in contrast to activation of GR steroid binding activity, activation of apo-nNOS heme binding activity in this cell-free system does not require heterocomplex assembly with hsp90. We speculate that the hsp90-based chaperone machinery activates nNOSin vivo by facilitating heme entry into its binding site in the enzyme interior. However, in the cell-free system where abundant heme is readily available, transient opening of the heme binding cleft by components of a reticulocyte protein folding/unfolding system may be sufficient for promoting heme entry and nNOS activation without a requirement for hsp90. Untreated rabbit reticulocyte lysate was from Green Hectares (Oregon, WI). 125I-Conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs were from NEN Life Science Products. The AC88 monoclonal IgG against hsp90 was from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada), and rabbit antiserum (23Erhart U.C. Duthu A. Ullrich S. Appella E. May P. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 595-603PubMed Google Scholar) that reacts with both hsp90 and hsp70 was kindly provided by Dr. Ettore Appella (National Cancer Institute). The affinity purified rabbit IgG against brain NOS used for immunoblotting nNOS was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The BuGR2 monoclonal IgG antibody against the GR was from Affinity Bioreagents (Neshanic Station, NJ). The rabbit antiserum used to immunoprecipitate nNOS was raised against rat neuronal NOS and was the generous gift of Dr. Lance Pohl (NHLBI, Bethesda). The antibody was affinity purified prior to use. The cDNA for rat neuronal NOS was kindly provided by Dr. Solomon Snyder (Johns Hopkins Medical School, Baltimore). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably transfected with rat neuronal NOS by Bredtet al. (24Bredt D.S. Hwang P.M. Glatt C.E. Lowenstein C. Reed R.R. Snyder S.H. Nature. 1991; 351: 714-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. Bettie Sue Masters (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio). HEK 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with calf serum and G418 (0.5 mg/ml) as described previously (25McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J. Snyder S.H. Clark J.E. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11141-11145Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), except that the l-arginine concentration was 100 μm. HEK cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and homogenized with a Tenbroeck ground glass homogenizer in 1 ml (per 108 cells) of HE buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA) with 20 mm sodium molybdate, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm leupeptin, 0.5 μm pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 3 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 × g, with the supernatant being the cytosol fraction. L cell cytosol for immunoadsorption of GR was prepared as described previously (4Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4992-4997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nNOS cDNA derived from pBluescript plasmid was subcloned into theEcoRI and NotI sites of the transfer vector PVL1393 as follows. The non-coding region from NotI (position 4699) to NotI site on pBluescript was excised, and the remaining cDNA was religated to remove the 3′ EcoRI site. Primers were synthesized (ACTGAATTCACCATGGAAGAGAACACGTTTGG and GCTTTTCATCGTGGGGTCAATGG) to generate a polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to position 346–906 as well as introducing anEcoRI site. The sequence of the polymerase chain reaction product was confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into theEcoRI to BclI sites. The resulting clone was directionally cloned into PVL1393. Recombinant baculovirus was cloned by standard under-agarose plaque assays (26O'Reillly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors, A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were grown in SFM 900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with Cytomax (Kemp Biotechnology, Rockville, MD) in suspension cultures maintained at 27 °C with continuous shaking (150 rpm). Cultures were infected in log phase of growth with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.0. In some cases, after 48 h, heme (24 μm) was added as an albumin conjugate, prepared as described previously (27Richards M.K. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14723-14732Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested and suspended in 1 volume of 10 mmHepes, pH 7.5, containing 320 mm sucrose, 100 μm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 100 μm leupeptin, 0.5 μmpepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, and the suspended cells were ruptured by Dounce homogenization. Native nNOS·hsp90 heterocomplexes were immunoadsorbed from 300 μl of HEK 293 cytosol for 2 h at 4 °C with 15 μl of anti-nNOS IgG and subsequently incubated with 8-μl pellets of protein A-Sepharose. Immune pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold TEG buffer (10 mm TES, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 4 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol) containing both 20 mm sodium molybdate (TEGM) and 0.4% Triton X-100. In Fig. 1 A, some of the samples were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate). Immune pellets were boiled in SDS sample buffer with 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and proteins were resolved on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with 0.1% anti-nNOS and 1 μg/ml AC88 for hsp90. The immunoblots were then incubated a second time with 125I-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgGs to visualize the immunoreactive bands. Lysates from infected Sf9 cells (2 × 109) were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction was loaded onto a 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose column (2 ml), and the nNOS was affinity purified as described (28Roman L.J. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Masters B.S.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), except that 10 mm 2′-AMP in high salt buffer was used to elute the protein. The nNOS-containing fraction was concentrated and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μmtetrahydrobiopterin with the use of a ProDicon and a 100-kDa cut-off membrane. The concentrated sample was stored at −80 °C. nNOS activity was assayed by the following three methods: 1) conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin; 2) assay of nitrate and nitrite released into the cell growth medium; and 3) conversion of [14C]arginine to citrulline. Conversion of oxyhemoglobin was assayed by adding 20 μl of insect cell lysate to an assay solution containing 100 μm CaCl2, 100 μm NADPH, 100 μm arginine, 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 100 unit/ml catalase, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, and 25 μmoxyhemoglobin in a total volume of 200 μl of 50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C, and the rate of oxidation of oxyhemoglobin was monitored by measuring the absorbance at λ401–411 nm with a microtiter plate reader as described (29Feelisch M. Kubitzek D. Werringloer J. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 455-478Google Scholar). The amount of nitrate and nitrite in the cell medium was assayed by the use of nitrate reductase and quantitation by the Griess method as described (30Schmidt H.H. Warner T.D. Nakane M. Forstermann U. Murad F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 615-624PubMed Google Scholar). To assay conversion of arginine to citrulline, an aliquot (5 μl) of incubation mixture was added to an assay solution containing 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NADPH, 50 μm [14C]arginine (32 mCi/mmol), 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 10 μg/ml calmodulin, in a total volume of 100 μl of 40 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The assay mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the amount of [14C]citrulline was determined as described previously (31Osawa Y. Davila J.C. Meyer C.M. Nakatsuka M. Lechner M.C. Cytochrome P-450: Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Molecular Biology. John Libby Eurotext Ltd., Paris1994: 459-462Google Scholar). Rabbit reticulocyte lysate (25 ml) was adsorbed to a 2.5 × 20-cm column of DE52 equilibrated with HE buffer (10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.35); the column was washed with 150 ml of HE buffer with 20 mm sodium molybdate followed by 150 ml of HE buffer alone, and proteins were eluted with a 400-ml gradient of 0–0.5m KCl. Proteins in the drop-through and wash or in DE52-retained material eluted with salt were concentrated and dialyzed against HKD buffer (10 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.35). hsp90, hsp70, Hop, and p23 were detected in the DE52-retained material by resolving an aliquot of each fraction by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with appropriate antibodies, and fractions were combined in three pools designated A–C as described by Dittmar et al. (32Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Pooled fractions were dialyzed against HKD buffer, concentrated to 1 ml (1/25 the original volume of lysate), and flash-frozen in small aliquots. hsp70 was purified from the DE52 fraction pool A of rabbit reticulocyte lysate by chromatography on ATP-agarose and elution with ATP followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation exactly as described previously (33Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hsp90 was purified from the DE52 fraction B of rabbit reticulocyte lysate by chromatography on hydroxylapatite followed by chromatography over ATP-agarose as described previously (33Hutchison K.A. Dittmar K.D. Czar M.J. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5043-5049Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucocorticoid receptors were immunoadsorbed from 250 to 300-μl aliquots of L cell cytosol by rotation for 2 h at 4 °C with 8 μl of protein A-Sepharose prebound with BuGR antibody. Prior to incubation with reticulocyte lysate, immunoadsorbed receptors were stripped of associated hsp90 by incubating the immunopellet an additional 2 h at 4 °C with 0.5 m NaCl followed by one wash with 1 ml of TEG and a second wash with 1 ml of Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). BuGR immune pellets (8 μl of protein A-Sepharose) containing GR stripped of hsp90 were incubated with 50 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate, with the DE52 drop-through and wash material, with the DE52-retained proteins of reticulocyte lysate, or with fractions A–C of the retained proteins (each at 10 μl) and adjusted to 50 μl with HKD buffer. Dithiothreitol (1 μl) was added to each incubation to a final concentration of 5 mm, and 5 μl of an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm ATP, 250 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mm MgOAc, and 100 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) were added to all assays to yield a final assay volume of 56 μl. The assay mixtures were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with resuspension of the pellets by shaking the tubes every 5 min. At the end of the incubation, one-fourth of the suspension was removed for assay of steroid binding, and the remainder was used for Western blotting of receptor and associated hsp90 as described previously (32Dittmar K.D. Hutchison K.A. Owens-Grillo J.K. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12833-12839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Steroid binding is expressed as the counts/min of [3H]triamcinolone acetonide bound per GR immune pellet prepared from 100 μl of L cell cytosol. Apo-nNOS (5.6 μg) purified from Sf9 cells incubated in heme-free medium was incubated for 1.5 h at 20 °C with 2.5 μl of the ATP-regenerating system, 3.5 μl of a cofactor mixture (100 μm FAD, 100 μm FMN, 1 mml-arginine, 100 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, 200 units/ml superoxide dismutase, 2000 units/ml catalase), and other additions as noted in the figure legends adjusted to a total incubation volume of 35 μl with HKD buffer. At the end of the incubation, nNOS activity was assayed by conversion of [14C]arginine to citrulline. It should be noted that the apo-nNOS contained minor amounts of holoprotein, which is produced during recombinant expression of nNOS in insect cells due to endogenous heme synthesis. The amount of heme was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography as described previously (34Sugiyama K. Highet R.J. Woods A. Cotter R.J. Osawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Samples were injected onto a high pressure liquid chromatography column (C4 Vydac, 5 μm, 0.21 × 15 cm) equilibrated with solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. A gradient was run to 75% solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) over 30 min and then to 100% solvent B over the next 5 min. Absorbance at 400 nm was monitored. Myoglobin (horse heart) was used as a standard. The ferrous-carbonyl complex was determined from the CO difference spectrum of the reduced protein with the use of an extinction coefficient of 91 mm−1 (25McMillan K. Bredt D.S. Hirsch D.J.

Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Apo-nNOS was treated with the DE52-retained proteins of reticulocyte lysate as described above. A portion of this mixture (200 μl) was added to a solution containing 20% glycerol and 0.1 mm EDTA in 1.8 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4. The difference spectrum was measured with the use of an Aminco-DW2 spectrophotometer modified with the OLIS-DW2 operating system. To detect native nNOS·hsp90 heterocomplexes, cytosol from HEK 293 cells expressing rat nNOS was immunoadsorbed with nNOS-specific rabbit antiserum, and both the nNOS and the co-immunoadsorbed hsp90 in the washed immune pellet were detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1 A, nNOS immunopellets washed with buffer containing 20 mm molybdate and either 0.1% (lane 2) or 0.4% (lane 4) Triton X-100 contained hsp90. But hsp90 was dissociated from nNOS in pellets washed under harsher detergent conditions with RIPA buffer (lane 6), despite the presence of molybdate as a heterocomplex stabilizing agent. Garcia-Cardeña et al. (22Garcia-Cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar) lysed cerebella in buffer under harsh detergent conditions (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), and it is not surprising that nNOS·hsp90 heterocomplexes were not detected, despite the presence of 1 mm vanadate as a stabilizing agent in their lysis buffer. The native rat nNOS·human hsp90 heterocomplexes immunoadsorbed from HEK 293 cytosol behaved like steroid receptor·hsp90 heterocomplexes (1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar) in that they dissociated when the immune pellets were suspended in buffer and incubated at 25 °C (cf. lane 6 withlane 2 in Fig. 1 B), and this thermal dissociation was inhibited by molybdate (lane 4). Geldanamycin is a benzoquinonone ansamycin antibiotic that binds to the nucleotide-binding site of hsp90 and specifically blocks hsp90 function (36Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E.G. DeCosta B. Myers C.E.

Rimerman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6804-6812Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In geldanamycin-treated cells, proteins that are regulated by hsp90 are degraded more rapidly by a ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal mechanism (for review, see Ref. 2Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 A, HEK 293 cells were treated with 10 μm geldanamycin, and the amount of nNOS protein decreased ∼50% in 24 h. Consistent with a geldanamycin-dependent increase in the rate of nNOS turnover, a similar decrease in nNOS occurred when translation of new enzyme was blocked with cycloheximide (Fig. 2 A). The effect of geldanamycin is concentration-dependent, with a substantial decrease in nNOS protein being observed at 1 μm antibiotic (Fig. 2 B). Fig. 3 shows the effect of a 6-h treatment with 10 μm geldanamycin on HEK 293 cell nNOS activity. In that 24 h of treatment with geldanamycin are required to decrease nNOS protein levels by 50% (Fig. 2), the 80% decrease in nNOS activity observed after 6 h of treatment with geldanamycin (Fig. 3) cannot be accounted for by increased nNOS degradation. As also shown in Fig. 3, treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 increases nNOS activity and co-treatment with geldanamycin inhibits the enzyme activity. Both the geldanamycin-mediated reduction in nNOS activity and the increase in rate of nNOS turnover support the proposal that hsp90 regulates nNOS function in intact HEK 293 cells. Sf9 cells have very low levels of endogenous heme, and addition of exogenous heme to the culture medium causes an increase in nNOS activity in infected cells. In the experiments shown in Fig. 4, Sf9 cells expressing rat nNOS were incubated in the presence of heme, and cells were harvested at various times for assay of nNOS activity by conversion of oxyhemoglobin to methemoglobin. Addition of heme (closed circles) increases nNOS activity 7-fold with respect to the activity in the absence of exogenous heme (open squares). This heme-dependent increase in nNOS activity is inhibited ∼30% by geldanamycin (open circlesand bars in inset). Reticulocyte lysate contains all of the components required to assemble heterocomplexes between hsp90 and steroid receptors or protein kinases (for review, see Refs. 1Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar and 2Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, incubation of immunoadsorbed, hsp90-free, mouse GR with rabbit reticulocyte lysate results in assembly of a GR·hsp90 heterocomplex (Western blot) and generation of steroid binding activity (bar graph). When the components of reticulocyte lysate are separated into drop-through and retained fractions by passage through DE52, the GR·hsp90 assembly activity is present in the DE52-retained fraction"

We report here that, contrary to previous assumptions, association of GR into hsp-containing complexes is not sufficient to prevent the shuttling or trafficking of the GR across the nuclear membrane. Following the withdrawal of treatment with cortisol or the hormone antagonist RU486, GRs recycled rapidly into hsp-associated, hormone-responsive complexes. However, cortisol-withdrawn receptors redistributed to the cytoplasm very slowly ( t12 = 8–9 h) and RU486-withdrawn receptors not at all. Persistent localization of these GRs to the nucleus was not due to a gross defect in export, since in both instances the complexed nuclear GRs transferred efficiently between heterokaryon nuclei. Moreover, the addition of a nuclear retention signal to the N terminus of GR induced the transfer of naive receptor to the nucleus in the absence of steroid. These results suggest that the localization of GR to the cytoplasm is determined by fine control of the rates of transfer of GR across the nuclear membrane and/or by active retention that occurs independently from the association of GR with hsps.

In the absence of hormone, steroid receptors are packaged into similar multiprotein complexes that migrate at 8 S on sucrose gradients (1Litwack G. Cake M.H. Filler R. Taylor K. Biochem.

Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). They also contain hsp90-associated proteins, such as hsp70, p23, p14, and high molecular weight immunophilins, including Cyp40 and FKBP56 (3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Hormone binding induces dissociation of the active receptors from the hsp complexes and promotes sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional regulation. Steroid binding is transient, and the loss of hormone from the receptor leads to a repackaging or recycling of the receptor into the hsp-containing complex (4Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Massa E. Meshinchi S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21397-21400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), association with hsps is required for steroid binding (5Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The primary steroid receptor nuclear localization signal (NLS), NL1, overlaps with the C-terminal ends of the receptor DNA binding domains (10LaCasse E.C. Lefebvre Y.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 11Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 12Tang Y.

EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Additionally, the receptor for glucocorticoids (GR) has a second, ligand-dependent NLS (NL2) in the ligand binding domain whose sequence has not been delimited (11Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Receptor nuclear export signals, however, remain to be identified. For GR, nuclear localization also appears to be dependent in large part on nuclear retention mediated through the binding of the receptors to DNA (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 15Danielsen M. Northrop J.P. Ringold G.M. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2513-2522Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), the nuclear matrix (16van Steensel B. Jenster G. Damm K. Brinkmann A.O. van Driel R. J. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1989-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and other nuclear components (18van Steensel B. Brink M. van der Meulen K. van Binnendijk E.P. Wansink D.G. de Jong L. de Kloet E.R. van Driel R. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3003-3011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite similarities in nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking in the liganded state, the similar nature of their NLSs, and a common association into hsp-containing complexes, steroid receptors are differentially localized in the cell in the absence of hormone. Unliganded estrogen (ER) (19Puca G.A. Medici N. Armetta I. Nigro V. Moncharmont B. Molinari A.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 464: 168-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and progesterone receptors (PR) (20Press M.F. Greene G.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) are nuclear, while naive GR, mineralocorticoid receptor, and possibly androgen receptor are localized to the cytoplasm (11Picard D. Yamamoto K.R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3333-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol.

The molecular basis for these differences in localization is not understood. However, the nuclear localization of ER and PR does not appear to be due to a defect in nuclear export, since naive PR transfers rapidly between nuclei in heterokaryon fusion experiments (9Guiochon-Mantel A. Lescop P. Christin-Maitre S. Loosfelt H. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3851-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The usual explanation offered for the cytoplasmic localization of naive GR is that its association into the hsp-containing complex acts to mask its NL1 in a way that prevents recognition by the nuclear import machinery (23Czar M.J. Lyons R.H. Welsh M.J. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1549-1560PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hutchison K.A. Scherrer L.C. Czar M.J. Stancato L.F. Chow Y.H. Jove R. Pratt W.B. Ann. N. Y.

This proposal is supported by a study demonstrating that hsp association of GR prevents the binding of an NL1-specific antibody (26Urda L.A. Yen P.M. Stoney Simons S.J. Harmon J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, other results are inconsistent with this simple model. For example, the redistribution of GR to the cytoplasm upon hormone withdrawal occurs far more slowly than could be expected to be accounted for by the time required for hormone dissociation and hsp reassociation (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 27Munck A. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

DeFranco D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 523-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This is true even for GR DNA binding mutants that never become more than 75% nuclear in the presence of hormone (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Second, overexpression of GR in many cell lines results in the nuclear localization of the hsp-associated receptor, without discernible change in other properties (30Martins V.R. Pratt W.B. Terracio L. Hirst M.A. Ringold G.M. Housley P.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Sanchez E.R. Hirst M. Scherrer L.C. Tang H.Y. Welsh M.J. Harmon J.M. Simons Jr., S.S. Ringold G.M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20123-20130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, treatment of cytoplasmic GRs expressed by transient transfection with the hormone antagonist RU486 results in a nuclear GR that reacquires steroid responsiveness following antagonist withdrawal but does not redistribute to the cytoplasm (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 32Qi M. Stasenko L.J. DeFranco D.B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 455-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we have directly examined the nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of hormone-free GR prior to hormone treatment and following hormone withdrawal. Our results demonstrate that hsp-associated GRs exchange continuously between nucleus and cytoplasm and suggest that the cytoplasmic localization of naive receptors occurs through a process that is more complex than has been previously appreciated. GrH2 cells (derived from a rat hepatoma cell line stably transfected with rat GR, expressing approximately 100,00 GR molecules/cell) (33Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A. Yamamoto K.R. Cell. 1986; 46: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), COS7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651), or NIH 3T3 (ATCC CRL-6474) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays, lipofectamine (15 μg) was used to transfect GrH2 cells with plasmids RSV-βgal (1 μg), to monitor transfection efficiency, and pBLMMTVCAT (34Cato A.C. Weinmann J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 2119-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) (MMTV −631/+105, 3 μg), as the reporter gene. Sixteen hours after transfection, the cells were switched to serum-free medium. After 16 h in serum-free medium, hormonal treatments were initiated. RU38486 (RU486) was generously provided by RousselUclaf. Cells were treated and harvested as indicated in individual experiments. CAT assays were carried out as we have previously described (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was used to correct transfection efficiency, and the results displayed are the average of three experiments performed in duplicate. The DNA-binding domain of c-Abl, amino acids 862–959 (35Van Etten R.A. Jackson P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 669-678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), was cloned as a StuI–SalI fragment into the pTL-GR expression vector (36Préfontaine G.G. Lemieux M.E. Schild-Poulter C. Pope L. LaCasse E. Walker P. Haché R.J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3416-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and into a pTLmyc-GR vector with Lys-Asn mutations at amino acids 513–515. To monitor the subcellular distribution of GR by immunofluorescence, GrH2 or COS7 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine (500 μg/ml)-coated glass coverslips and incubated overnight in 35-mm tissue culture plates in DMEM containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum. Cells were synchronized to G0 by incubation in serum-free DMEM for a further 21 h prior to the initiation of treatment. Dexamethasone, cortisol, and RU486 were added to final concentrations of 10−6m in serum-free medium. To monitor redistribution of GR to the cytoplasm following hormone withdrawal, cells pretreated with cortisol (10−6m) or RU486 (10−6m) for 1 h were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and twice in serum-free medium with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Subsequent incubation was in serum-free supplemented with BSA to 5%. For heterokaryon analyses, GrH2 cells were co-plated with NIH 3T3 cells onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. After attachment, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium for 16 h, treated with RU486 (10−6m) or cortisol (10−6m) for 1 h, and washed as described above and then with serum-free medium for 2 h before fusion. Cell fusion was performed by adding 50% polyethylene glycol 4000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 min at 37 °C (37Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The cells were then washed five times with calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubated for 4 h in serum-free DMEM before being processed for IIF. Nuclei from GrH2 cells and NIH 3T3 cells were identified by staining with the Hoechst dye 33258 at 0.5 μg/ml. IIF was carried out exactly as described previously (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar) with primary murine BUGR-2 antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Inc.). Quantification was performed using double-blind encryption. For each time point, at least 400 stained cells were counted in each experiment. Each experiment was repeated 3–8 times over a period of several months. To prepare cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, GrH2 cells (5 × 105 cells/sample) were collected, washed, and suspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, at 4 °C, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer (B pestle), and nuclei were collected by centrifugation (3000 × g) (38Weil P.A. Luse D.S. Segall J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1979; 18: 469-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). For each experiment, we confirmed before fractionation that fewer than 5% of the homogenized cells excluded trypan blue. The supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction. Nuclei were suspended in a low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02m KCl), and proteins were extracted with a high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.2m KCl) over 30 min. Prior to fractionation through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, GRs were concentrated and desalted by immunoprecipitation from the cytosolic and nuclear fractions as described previously (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar, 39Giffin W. Torrance H. Rodda D.J. Préfontaine G.G. Pope L. Haché R.J. Nature. 1996; 380: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, samples were electrophoretically transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and GR was probed on Western blots with BuGR-2 and sheep anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection of GR was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chemiluminescent signals were quantified using a CH imaging screen (Bio-Rad) on a Bio-Rad GS-525 Molecular Imager. Whole cell extracts of GrH2 cells prepared as described previously (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar) were fractionated through 15–30% sucrose gradients for 16 h at 55,000 rpm at 4 °C (40Thole H.H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 463-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). 300-μl fractions were collected, immunoprecipitated with BuGR-2, and fractionated through 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Chemiluminescent signals were quantified using a CH screen on a Bio-Rad GS-525 Molecular Imager. Markers for the gradients were aldolase (7.3 S) and BSA (4.6 S). GrH2 cells were cultured overnight in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 5% BSA prior to treatment with cortisol (10−6m) or RU486 (10−6m) for 1 h. Cells were withdrawn from ligand treatment in serum-free media and harvested at the time points indicated, and cell number was determined before resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline containing either 3H-cortisol or3H-cortisol + 50 μm cold cortisol (1000-fold excess) as described previously (41Distelhorst C.W. Kullman L. Wasson J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1987; 26: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). After a 30-min incubation, the cells were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Experiments were performed three times in duplicate, and values were compared with the initial level of specific cortisol binding in untreated cells. Maintenance of GR-expressing cells in culture in the absence of serum allows for the examination of the subcellular trafficking of a stable pool of GR without appreciable new synthesis or degradation of the receptor molecules for periods exceeding 48 h (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Further, under these culture conditions, the cells mimic the usual G0–G1 state of differentiated glucocorticoid-responsive cells in the majority of mammalian target tissues (42Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). Previously, we have observed in transient transfection experiments in which GRs were overexpressed that redistribution of GR to the cytoplasm following hormone withdrawal occurred only over a period of several hours (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors in RU486-treated cells, however, failed to redistribute appreciably to the cytoplasm for at least 48 h following withdrawal of treatment. To begin a detailed analysis of the exchange of unliganded GRs between nucleus and cytoplasm that underlies their localization, we sought to determine whether GRs expressed at more physiological levels redistributed similarly to overexpressed receptor in response to hormone agonists and antagonists. In untreated GrH2 cells, which stably express rat GR and have been used extensively to study glucocorticoid hormone action (7Madan A.P. DeFranco D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3588-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 43Hsu S. DeFranco D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3359-3364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the receptor is entirely localized to the cytoplasm prior to hormone treatment (7Madan A.P. DeFranco D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3588-3592Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). To monitor the time course of redistribution of GRs in these cells, we employed an indirect immunofluorescence assay that we and others have previously demonstrated to allow quantification of the changes in the subcellular localization of steroid hormone receptors over a period of time (13Ylikomi T. Bocquel M.T. Berry M. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3681-3694Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar,14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of GrH2 cells with the nonmetabolizable hormone agonist dexamethasone induced a rapid and nearly complete nuclear uptake ( t12 = 4–5 min, 90–95% nuclear) of GR (Fig.1). This rate was identical to the one we previously observed for transiently transfected GRs (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar) and the rate that others have noted for endogenous GR in rat thymus cells measured by biochemical fractionation (27Munck A. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 820-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar uptake results were also obtained with the natural steroid cortisol. 2R. J. G. Haché, R. Tse, T. Reich, J. G. A. Savory, and Y. A. Lefebvre, unpublished observation. Nuclear transfer of GR upon RU486 treatment was similar but occurred more slowly ( t12 = 9–10 min). This difference is believed to reflect a decreased rate of dissociation of RU486-bound GR from the heat shock protein complex rather than a difference in nuclear import (44Distelhorst C.W. Howard K.J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 36: 25-31Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thereafter, in the continuous presence of dexamethasone or RU486, greater than 90% of cells contained GR that remained exclusively nuclear for at least 48 h. Upon withdrawal of a 1-h treatment with cortisol, a process that included thorough washing of the cells to ensure complete washout of the steroid, GR redistributed to the cytoplasm only very slowly over an extended period of time (Fig. 2, t12 = 8–9 h). This contrasts with the rapid off rate ( t12 = 10 min) of cortisol and RU486 from GR (27Munck A. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 820-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More strikingly, upon withdrawal of RU486 treatment, GR remained fully nuclear and did not appreciably redistribute to the cytoplasm. Further, the persistence of GR in the nucleus upon ligand withdrawal is unlikely to reflect the low residual level of intracellular ligand, since we have previously demonstrated, in transient transfection experiments, that a GR mutant with a 10-fold lower affinity for ligand responded to the withdrawal of RU486 and cortisol identically to WT GR (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, it has been demonstrated that upon withdrawal of hormone agonist, the subnuclear localization of GR is altered prior to its redistribution to the cytoplasm (29Yang J. Liu J. DeFranco D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 523-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but the association of GR with heat shock proteins during this period has not been examined. However, this intermediate state is marked by an increased sensitivity of the GR in the agonist-withdrawn cells to biochemical extraction. In GrH2 cells treated with cortisol or RU486 for 1 h, virtually 100% of the GRs remained nuclear upon hypotonic lysis of the cells at 4 °C (Fig. 3 A). However, 2 h after withdrawal of cortisol, a time when over 90% of the GRs were nuclear according to immunofluorescence data, the receptor was completely lost into the cytosol upon hypotonic cellular lysis. We observed the same result with RU486-withdrawn cells. Within 2 h of withdrawal of RU486, essentially all of the receptor fractionated biochemically into the cytosol upon hypotonic lysis of the cells (Fig.3 A). The loss of nuclear occupancy upon hypotonic cellular lysis following the withdrawal of hormone was reminiscent of both the facile nuclear extraction of liganded GRs containing mutations that eliminate DNA binding (14Sackey F.N.A. Haché R.J.G. Reich T. Kwast-Welfeld J. Lefebvre Y.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1191-1205PubMed Google Scholar) and that of untreated nuclear ERs and PRs associated with hsps (45Catelli M.G. Binart N. Jung-Testas I. Renoir J.M. Baulieu E.E. Feramisco J.R. Welsh W.J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3131-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Association of GRs with heat shock proteins is reflected on sucrose gradients by a shift in sedimentation coefficient from 4 to 8 S (1Litwack G. Cake M.H. Filler R. Taylor K. Biochem. J. 1978; 169: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To determine whether GR in RU486-treated cells had recycled into an 8 S complex upon withdrawal of treatment, the cytosol from hypotonically lysed cells shown in Fig. 3 A was fractionated over sucrose gradients (Fig. 3 B). Within 2 h of the withdrawal of treatment, GRs from the RU486-treated cells appeared to be completely reassociated with hsps into 8 S complexes. Association of GR into the hsp complex occurs through a highly ordered, ATP-dependent process that can be efficiently reconstituted in rabbit reticulocyte lysate at 30 °C (4Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Massa E. Meshinchi S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21397-21400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but that is not known to occur in cellular extracts at 4 °C (3Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, to discount the possibility of artifactual reassociation of GR with hsps in our cellular extracts, we carried out several control experiments. In the first instance, we assessed the ability of heat-transformed GRs to reassociate with hsps in cellular extracts at 4 °C. Following heat transformation in whole cell extract, incubation of the GR-containing extract for 30 min on ice in the presence of molybdate was completely ineffective in promoting the reassociation of GR into the 8 S complex.2 This was also true for heat-transformed in vitro translated GR mixed with whole cell extract that had been spared the heat treatment and for cellular GRs in extracts supplemented with untreated whole cell extracts from the GR− parental cell line of GrH2 cells.2 Therefore, we conclude that the rapid reassociation of GRs with heat shock proteins upon withdrawal of RU486 was not sufficient to initiate the redistribution of GR to the cytoplasm. Similarly, reassociation of cortisol-withdrawn GRs into 8 S complexes was complete at 2 h, when only 10% of the receptors had redistributed to the cytoplasm.2 Ligand binding by GR is strictly dependent upon an ordered assembly of the receptor with the heat shock proteins that fixes the receptor ligand binding domain in a conformation competent to bind ligand (4Scherrer L.C. Dalman F.C. Massa E. Meshinchi S. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21397-21400Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bresnick E.H. Dalman F.C. Sanchez E.R. Pratt W.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5834-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether cortisol and RU486-withdrawn GRs also reacquired ligand binding ability more rapidly than they redistributed to the cytoplasm, we performed whole cell steroid binding assays on naive cells and cells withdrawn for increasing times from treatment with cortisol and RU486 (Fig. 4). The results indicate that over 75% of high affinity glucocorticoid binding sites were regenerated in GrH2 cells within 1 h of the withdrawal of the cells from either cortisol or RU486. Indeed, approximately 40% of the binding sites were regenerated within 30 min of withdrawal. Thus, upon withdrawal of steroid treatment, the GRs reassociated into 8 S complexes competent to bind steroid well in advance of their redistribution to the cytoplasm. Further, it suggests that the failure of GRs in RU486-treated cells to redistribute to the cytoplasm upon hormone withdrawal was not due to a defect in the recycling of the receptor into a hormone-responsive state.

https://openalex.org/W2160888228,"Computer-assisted analyses indicate thatBacillus subtilis contains approximately 300 genes for exported proteins with an amino-terminal signal peptide. About 114 of these are lipoproteins, which are retained in the cytoplasmic membrane. We have investigated the importance of lipoprotein processing by signal peptidase II (SPase II) for cellular homeostasis, using cells lacking SPase II. The results show that lipoprotein processing is important for cell viability at low and high temperatures, suggesting that lipoproteins are essential for growth under these conditions. Although certain lipoproteins are required for the development of genetic competence, sporulation, and germination, these developmental processes were not affected in the absence of SPase II. Cells lacking SPase II accumulated lipid-modified precursor and mature-like forms of PrsA, a folding catalyst for secreted proteins. These forms of PrsA seem to have a reduced activity, as the secretion of α-amylase was strongly impaired. Unexpectedly, type I signal peptidases, which process secretory preproteins, were not involved in alternative amino-terminal processing of pre-PrsA in the absence of SPase II. In conclusion, processing of lipoproteins by SPase II in B. subtilis is not strictly required for lipoprotein function, which is surprising as lipoproteins and type II SPases seem to be conserved in all eubacteria.

One of the most commonly used eubacterial sorting (retention) signals for proteins that are exported from the cytoplasm is an amino-terminal lipid-modified cysteine residue (see Refs. 1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Sankaran K. Wu H.C. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1994: 17-29Google Scholar). In Gram-positive eubacteria, such as Bacillus subtilis,lipid-modified proteins (lipoproteins) are retained in the cytoplasmic membrane. In Gram-negative eubacteria, such as Escherichia coli, these proteins are retained in the cytoplasmic or the outer membrane; retention in the cytoplasmic membrane depends on the presence of an additional sorting signal in the form of an aspartic acid residue at the +2 position relative to the amino-terminal cysteine residue (see Refs. 3Yamaguchi K.

No other putative lipoproteins of this type were identified. Lipoproteins are directed into the general (Sec) pathway for protein secretion by their signal peptides, which show similar structural characteristics as the signal peptides of secretory proteins: a positively charged amino terminus, a hydrophobic core region, and a carboxyl-terminal region containing the cleavage site for signal peptidase (SPase). 2The abbreviations used are: SPase, signal peptidase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TY, tryptone/yeast extract. 2The abbreviations used are: SPase, signal peptidase; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TY, tryptone/yeast extract. The major difference between signal peptides of lipoproteins and secretory proteins is the presence of a well conserved “lipobox” of four residues in the former signal peptides, which constitutes the cleavage site for the lipoprotein-specific SPase, also known as SPase II. Invariably, the carboxyl-terminal residue of the lipobox is cysteine, which, upon lipid modification, forms the retention signal of the mature lipoprotein (for details, see Refs. 1Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 8von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1989; 2: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Modification of this cysteine residue by the diacylglyceryl transferase is a prerequisite for processing of the lipoprotein precursor by SPase II. Processing by SPase II can be inhibited with globomycin, a reversible and noncompetitive peptide inhibitor (2Sankaran K. Wu H.C. von Heijne G. Signal Peptidases. R. G.

In E. coli, the processed lipoprotein is further modified by aminoacylation of the diacylglycerylcysteine amino group (11Tokunaga M. Tokunaga H. Wu H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It is presently not known whether the latter lipid modification step is conserved in all eubacteria. For example, B. subtilis and M. genitalium lack an lnt gene for the lipoprotein aminoacyltransferase.1 In Gram-negative eubacteria, the outer membrane confines numerous proteins to the periplasm. In Gram-positive eubacteria, which lack an outer membrane, lipid modification of exported proteins prevents their loss into the environment, as these proteins remain anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane. This may explain why B. subtiliscontains more putative lipoproteins than E. coli and why, for example, 32 lipoproteins of B. subtilis are homologues of periplasmic high affinity substrate-binding proteins from Gram-negative eubacteria (Table I). Lipoproteins of Gram-positive eubacteria with a known function are involved in a variety of processes, such as the uptake of nutrients, resistance to antibiotics, protein secretion, competence for DNA binding and uptake, sporulation, germination, and bacterial targeting to different substrates, bacteria, and host tissues (see Ref. 13Sutcliffe I.C. Russell R.R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, a close examination of the putative lipoproteins of B. subtilis, which were identified on the basis of the conserved lipobox, suggests that certain lipoproteins are also involved in oxidative phosphorylation, cell wall biogenesis, and autolysis. The importance of lipoproteins for the homeostasis of Gram-positive eubacteria is underscored by the observation that the most abundant lipoprotein of B. subtilis, PrsA, is essential for the efficient secretion of various proteins and cell viability (14Kontinen V.P. Sarvas M. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1988; 134: 2333-2344PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kontinen V.P. Saris P. Sarvas M. Mol.

Notably, no specific function can presently be assigned to the majority of putative lipoproteins of B. subtilis (about 75%; TableI) and other Gram-positive eubacteria. The present studies were aimed at the evaluation of the importance ofB. subtilis lipoproteins for cellular homeostasis in general, and their processing by SPase II in particular. For this purpose, SPase II-depleted cells were used. Unexpectedly, the results show that lipoprotein processing is required for growth at low and high temperatures and the efficient secretion of the α-amylase AmyQ (a non-lipoprotein) but not for growth and cell viability at 37 °C, development of competence for DNA binding and uptake, sporulation, or spore germination.

Despite these important roles, the precise mode of Ras-membrane interactions is not yet understood. It is especially important to characterize these interactions at the surface of intact cells. To investigate Ras-membrane interactions in live cells, we employed studies on the lateral mobility of a constitutively active Ras isoform to characterize its membrane dynamics, and examined the effects of the Ras-displacing antagonistS-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (FTS) (Haklai, R., Gana-Weisz, M., Elad, G., Paz, A., Marciano, D., Egozi, Y., Ben-Baruch, G., and Kloog, Y.

When stably expressed in Rat-1 cells, this protein was preferentially localized to the plasma membrane and displayed transforming activity. The lateral mobility studies demonstrated that GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) undergoes fast lateral diffusion at the plasma membrane, rather than exchange between membrane-bound and unbound states. Treatment of the cells with FTS had a biphasic effect on GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) lateral mobility. At the initial phase, the lateral diffusion rate of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) was elevated, suggesting that it is released from some constraints on its lateral mobility. This was followed by dislodgment of the protein into the cytoplasm, and a reduction in the diffusion rate of the fraction of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) that remained associated with the plasma membrane. Control experiments with other S-prenyl analogs showed that these effects are specific for FTS.

Although the essential role of membrane tethering in Ras signaling and transforming activity is well established, the precise mode of Ras-membrane interactions is not yet understood. It is not clear whether Ras proteins are stably associated with the plasma membrane or undergo rapid exchange between membrane-bound and unbound states (16Yokoe H. Meyer T. Nat. Biotech. 1996; 14: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whether they form tight complexes with putative membrane receptors (17Siddiqui A.A. Garland J.R. Dalton M.B. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3712-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and whether the Ras anchoring moieties (e.g.farnesylcysteine) interact randomly with the membrane lipid milieu or associate preferentially with distinctive domains or sites. A possible role for specific membrane domains is implied by the evidence that Ha-Ras is enriched in low buoyant density fractions typical of caveolae or analogous glycosphingolipid/cholesterol-enriched domains (14Song S.K.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22263-22270Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). FTS specifically dislodged farnesylated Ha-Ras from membranes of Rat-1 cells, but not non-farnesylated N-myristoylated Ras or prenylated Gβγ of heterotrimeric G-proteins (21Haklai R. Gana-Weisz M. Elad G. Paz A. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Kloog Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), suggesting that it disrupts the interactions of Ras with specific anchorage domains. Since FTS appears to affect directly membrane-bound Ras, it can serve as a tool to investigate Ras-membrane interactions, and has a potential therapeutic value. Earlier studies on Ras-membrane interactions either employed cell-free systems or involved cell or tissue fixation. Obviously, it is important to characterize these interactions at the surface of intact cells. To investigate Ras-membrane interactions in live cells, we applied in the current work fluorescence photobleaching recovery (FPR) studies on the lateral mobility of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged constitutively active Ki-Ras 4B(12V) (GFP-Ki-Ras(12V)) protein expressed in Rat-1 cells. In combination with experiments on the effects of the Ras antagonist FTS on Ras membrane anchorage, our results indicate that GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) undergoes fast lateral diffusion at the plasma membrane, rather than exchange between membrane-bound and unbound states. FTS was capable of releasing GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) from some constraints on its mobility during the early phase of FTS treatment, prior to the dislodgment of Ras from the plasma membrane. These results have implications for the nature of the interactions of Ki-Ras with specific membrane anchorage domains or sites. N-Acetyl-S-trans,trans-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC), S-geranylthiosalicylic acid (GTS) and FTS were prepared and purified as detailed elsewhere (18Marciano D. Ben-Baruch G. Marom M. Egozi Y. Haklai R.

Bovine serum albumin (BSA), fatty acid-free BSA, Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), cytochalasin D, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG, and protein A-Sepharose 4B were from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal pan-Ras antibody-3 (anti-Ras) was purchased from Calbiochem, and anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal IgG was fromCLONTECH. The entire coding region of human Ki-Ras 4B(12V) cDNA cloned in pBluescript II SK via the PstI and BamHI sites of the multiple cloning region was a gift from P. Gierschik (University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). The insertion was performed by the use of polymerase chain reaction to generate flanking sequences on the 5′ (CTGGAGCAT, containing aPstI site) and on the 3′ (GGATCC, a BamHI site) ends of the Ki-Ras(12V) coding region. It was then excised by the same restriction enzymes, and inserted intoPstI/BamHI-digested pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH), resulting in a chimeric construct of enhanced GFP (a red-shifted enhanced GFP variant) fused in frame to the 5′ end of Ki-Ras(12V). The coding regions in the final construct were verified by DNA sequencing. Cells were routinely grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biological Industries, Beth Haemek, Israel) and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). To generate stably expressing cell lines, Rat-1 cells (1 × 106 in a 35-mm dish) were transfected with 1 μg of DNA from the pEGFP-C3 vector (for expression of free, unfused GFP) or the same vector containing the GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) cDNA. The transfection mixture contained 10 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 5 h of incubation at 37 °C, 1 ml of DMEM/FCS was added. After 48 h, the cells were transferred to a 10-cm dish, and incubated with selection medium (DMEM/FCS supplemented with 800 μg/ml G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). Single G418-resistant clones were isolated. The clones transfected with the vector containing the GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) cDNA were tested for expression of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) (see “Results”), and two representative clones were selected for further analysis. For experiments on guanine nucleotide binding (see below), COS-7 cells were transiently transfected by the DEAE-dextran method (23Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) using 4 μg of the GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) construct per 1 × 106cells in a 10-cm dish. We have basically employed a protocol described previously (24Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Dixon R.A. Vogel U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20437-20442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Satoh T. Endo M. Nakafuku M. Nakamura S. Kaziro Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eighteen hours after transfection, the medium was replaced by serum-free DMEM, and incubation was continued for 18 h. After washing with DMEM devoid of serum and phosphate, the cells were incubated 4 h at 37 °C with 4 ml of the same medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi of carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham). The cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed (15 min, 4 °C) with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 units/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol). After removal of insoluble material (14,000 rpm, 10-min spin in Eppendorf centrifuge), free nucleotides were removed by 1.4% charcoal (24Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Scolnick E.M. Dixon R.A. Vogel U.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20437-20442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From each sample, volumes containing equal amounts of radioactivity (5 × 107 cpm) were taken for immunoprecipitation, performed after completing the volume to 500 μl of lysis buffer, 1% BSA, 2 μg/ml anti-GFP. Following incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose (120 μg of protein A) were added, and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in PBS. The pellets were suspended in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 0.5 mm GDP, and 0.5 mm GTP. The suspension was heated (65 °C, 5 min) and centrifuged, and samples (11 μl) were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine cellulose TLC plate (Sigma), which was developed in 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.4. The TLC plates were analyzed by a phosphorimager (FujiX Bas1000), and the spots corresponding to guanine nucleotides were quantified using TINA 2.0 software by Ray Test (Staubenhardt, Germany). Stock solutions of FTS and its analogs were freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and diluted to working concentrations (10–50 μm) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS; the final Me2SO concentration was always 0.1%. Rat-1 cells expressing GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) or GFP were plated at densities specified for each experiment; 24 h later, the FTS-containing medium (or similar medium containing only 0.1% Me2SO in control experiments) was added for various time periods as indicated in the text. To estimate the effect of FTS on cell growth, the cells were plated in 24-well plates at 5000 cells/well, treated with the drug at various concentrations, and counted on day 4 of the treatment. Treatment with cytochalasin D (10 μg/ml, 15 min, 37 °C) was performed by adding it to the FTS-containing medium (or to the control medium) for the last 15 min of the incubation. The drug was kept in for the remainder of the experiment. Western blotting and ECL were performed as described by us previously (21Haklai R. Gana-Weisz M. Elad G. Paz A. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Kloog Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Rat-1 cells expressing GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) or GFP were plated at a density of 1 × 106/10-cm dish. After FTS treatment as described above, they were homogenized, and the cytosolic (S100) and total membrane (P100) fractions were obtained by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) (21Haklai R.

Samples of the total homogenate and of the S100 and P100fractions were calibrated for similar protein content, and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide (12.5%) gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic blotting onto nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked and incubated with antibodies as detailed previously (21Haklai R. Gana-Weisz M. Elad G. Paz A. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Kloog Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), using either mouse anti-Ras (1:2000) or rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000) followed by peroxidase-goat anti-mouse (1:7500) or anti-rabbit (1:5000) IgG, respectively. Bands were visualized by ECL and quantified by densitometry on a BioImaging System 202D (Dynco-Renium, Jerusalem, Israel), using Tina 2.0 software (Ray Test). The lipophilic indocarbocyanine lipid analog DiIC16, which distributes equally into both the external and internal leaflets of the plasma membrane in cells (26Schootemeijer A. Van Beekhuizen A.E. Tertoolen L.G. de Laat S.W. Akkerman J.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was incorporated into the plasma membrane of Rat-1 cells expressing GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) following the procedure of Edidin and Stroynowski (27Edidin M. Stroynowski I. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The cells were plated on glass coverslips placed in 35-mm dishes at 10,000 cells/dish. A stock solution of DiIC16 (100 μg/ml) was prepared in ethanol, and diluted prior to the experiment to 0.3 μg/ml in HBSS containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (HBSS/HEPES). The cells were incubated with this labeling solution 10 min at 22 °C, washed three times with HBSS/HEPES supplemented with 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA to remove free dye, and immersed in HBSS/HEPES containing BSA (not fatty acid-free; HBSS/HEPES/BSA) and 0.1% Me2SO (same conditions as for FTS treatment) for FPR studies. In experiments where the cells were treated with FTS for 30 min or 24 h, they were washed with HBSS/HEPES prior to labeling, and FTS was added back at the end of the labeling procedure; other than that, the DiIC16 labeling was identical to that employed for untreated cells. Incorporation of the membrane lipid marker R18 into the cellular plasma membrane was performed following procedures described previously (28Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar,29Morris S.J. Sarkar D.P. White J.M. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3972-3978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The procedure was similar to that described above for DiIC16, except that the labeling solution contained 1.8 μm R18, and the labeling was for 5 min at 4 °C. After the labeling, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, mounted in 0.1% gelatin/PBS, and visualized by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Lateral diffusion coefficients (D) and mobile fractions (RF) were measured by FPR (30Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2033) Google Scholar, 31Koppel D.E. Axelrod D. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys.

Acta. 1983; 762: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on glass coverslips at 10,000 cells/coverslip; they were treated where indicated with FTS or other drugs and/or labeled with DiIC16 as described above. The coverslip was placed (cells facing downward) over a serological slide with a depression filled with HBSS/HEPES/BSA and containing 0.1% Me2SO with or without FTS. The monitoring laser beam (Coherent Innova 70 argon ion laser; 488 nm and 1 microwatt for GFP fluorescence or 529.5 nm and 1 microwatt for DiIC16) was focused through the microscope (Zeiss Universal) to a Gaussian radius of 0.61 ± 0.02 μm using 100× oil immersion objective. In some cases, the beam size was changed to 1.23 ± 0.04 μm by using 40× water immersion objective. The beam radius was determined as described previously (33Petersen N.O. McConnaughey W.B. J. Supramol. Struct. Cell. Biochem. 1981; 17: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 34Henis Y.I. Yaron T. Lamed R. Rishpon J. Sahar E. Katchalski Katzir E. Biopolymers. 1988; 27: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The use of a pinhole in the image plane in the photometer head in front of the photomultiplier makes the light collection confocal, enabling the collection of fluorescence from a narrow depth in the focal plane (31Koppel D.E. Axelrod D. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1315-1329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), focusing either on the plasma membrane or in the cytoplasm. A brief pulse (5 milliwatts, 30–40 ms for the 100× objective, and 40–80 ms for the 40× objective) bleached 50–70% of the fluorescence in the illuminated region. The time course of fluorescence recovery was followed by the attenuated monitoring beam. D andRF were extracted from the fluorescence recovery curves by nonlinear regression analysis (35Petersen N.O. Felder S. Elson E.L. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C.C. Herzenberg L.A. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Edinburgh1986: 24.21-24.23Google Scholar). Incomplete fluorescence recovery is interpreted to represent fluorescence-labeled molecules immobile on the FPR experimental time scale (D ≤ 5 × 10−12 cm2/s). All the FPR measurements were conducted at 22 °C. In order to investigate the interactions of Ki-Ras with the plasma membrane of intact cells, we have generated a GFP-tagged constitutively active Ki-Ras 4B (GFP-Ki-Ras(12V)) and stably expressed it in Rat-1 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). The orientation of the construct was chosen to retain an intact Ki-Ras C-terminal domain, which is required for post-translational modification and membrane anchorage. The GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) was properly synthesized in the cells, as evidenced by Western immunoblotting using either anti-Ras or anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 1 A). Using anti-Ras, both GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) (54 kDa) and endogenous Ras (21 kDa) were detected, and only the latter was observed in homogenates prepared from cells expressing GFP alone. Upon labeling with anti-GFP, only the 54-kDa band was detected in cells expressing GFP-Ki-Ras(12V), and a 34-kDa band was observed in GFP-expressing Rat-1 cells. No labeling was detected in untransfected Rat-1 cells. The apparent molecular weight of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) fitted that expected for a GFP-Ras fusion protein, and no smaller fragments were detected. To validate the constitutively active nature of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V), we employed a guanine nucleotide binding assay in intact cells. In this assay, we employed anti-GFP to immunoprecipitate GFP-Ki-Ras(12V), in order to ensure that the binding measured is to the fusion protein and not to endogenous Ras. This experiment (Fig. 1 B), performed in transiently transfected COS-7 cells, demonstrated preferential binding of GTP over GDP to GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) (80% versus 20%, respectively), as expected for a constitutively active Ras isoform (7Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3780) Google Scholar, 8Bos J.L. Eur. J. Cancer. 1995; 31: 1051-1054Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The expression of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) in the Rat-1 clones was further validated by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. The fluorescent Ras isoform localized preferentially to the plasma membrane, as opposed to GFP expressed in Rat-1 cells, which distributed mainly to the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 2,A and B; see also Fig.3). This indicates that the association of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) with the plasma membrane is mediated by the Ras protein in this construct and not by the GFP. Importantly, GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) is biologically active, as evidenced by its transforming activity. Thus, the GFP-Ki-Ras(12V)-expressing Rat-1 cell lines exhibited anchorage-independent growth in soft agar (Fig. 2,C and D). Furthermore, these cells were able to develop tumors in nude mice at a rate similar to that of cells expressing a constitutively active Ras (5 out of 5 mice in both cases).Figure 3Confocal microscopy demonstrates a shift of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) from the plasma membrane to the cytoplasm following FTS treatment. Rat-1 cells stably expressing GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) were plated on glass coverslips, treated with 50 μm FTS for 48 h, and then labeled with R18 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After fixation with paraformaldehyde, dual images (green fluorescence for GFP, red for R18, andyellow where the two dyes coincide) were collected on the LSM 410 confocal microscope fitted with fluorescein and rhodamine filters. The images were exported in TIFF format to Adobe Photoshop and printed. Bar, 10 μm. The insets in each panel depict a z-scan analysis of the same cell (bar, 20 μm).

Gana-Weisz M. Elad G. Paz A. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Kloog Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of FTS on GFP-Ki-Ras(12V), Rat-1 cells stably expressing the fusion protein were subjected to FTS treatment and to analysis by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The results of a typical experiment are depicted in Fig. 3. Prior to FTS treatment, GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) was localized mainly at the rim of the cells, exhibiting typical plasma membrane labeling and co-localization with R18, a fluorescent membrane marker (Fig. 3, panels A–C; see also the insetsfor optical scanning along the z axis). Following FTS treatment (50 μm, 24–48 h), a significant amount of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) was dislodged from the membrane into the cytoplasm; the dislodgment was not complete, leaving some GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, panels D–F; see insetsfor z-scan). As expected, R18 remained at the plasma membrane. The dislodgment of GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) from the membrane was also followed biochemically, quantifying GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) in the membrane pellet and in the cytosolic fractions by immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibodies. Incubation of Rat-1 cells expressing GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) with 50 μm FTS for 24 h mediated a reduction in the relative amount of the protein associated with the membranes and a parallel increase in its cytosolic fraction, although a significant fraction remained in the membrane pellet (Fig. 4). This suggests that GFP-Ki-Ras(12V) is dislodged by FTS from the membrane and accumulates in the cytoplasm, in accord with the confocal microscopy results (Fig. 3). This differs from our former observations on the fate of Ha-Ras(12"

Synthetic double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotides with high affinity for a target transcription factor can be introduced into cells as decoy cis-elements to bind the factors and alter gene expression. The CRE (cyclic AMP response element)-transcription factor complex is a pleiotropic activator that participates in the induction of a wide variety of cellular and viral genes. Because the CRE cis-element, TGACGTCA, is palindromic, a synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotide composed of the CRE sequence self-hybridizes to form a duplex/hairpin. Herein we report that the CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide can penetrate into cells, compete with CRE enhancers for binding transcription factors, and specifically interfere with CRE- and AP-1-directed transcriptionin vivo.

This decoy oligonucleotide approach offers great promise as a tool for defining cellular regulatory processes and treating cancer and other diseases. Eukaryotic transcription is regulated by the interplay of various protein factors at promoters (1Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 2Keleher C.A. Goutte C. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1988; 53: 927-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). It has been shown that prokaryotic repressors can function as negative regulators of eukaryotic promoters (3Hu M.C.-T. Davidson N. Cell. 1987; 48: 555-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 4Brown M. Figge J. Hansen U. Wright C. Jeang K.-T. Khoury G. Livingston D.M. Roberts T.M. Cell. 1987; 49: 603-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that displacement of activating proteins might provide a general strategy for gene-specific repression in eukaryotes. Several approaches have been undertaken to control eukaryotic gene expression through such displacement.In one approach, trans-dominant mutants are generated that interfere with the function of transactivators. Mutants are generated that retain the ability to bind to cis-regulatory DNA sequences but that have dysfunctional transcriptional activation domains. These mutant transcription factors compete with their functional, wild-type counterparts for binding to the enhancer sequences and prevent the activation or repression of the target gene. Although this strategy has been successful, in vitro (5Friedman A.D. Triezenberg S.J. McKnight S.L. Nature. 1988; 335: 452-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Baltimore D.

Cell. 1989; 59: 113-120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), the generation of such mutants is not always possible. The transcription factor must be well characterized such that the activation domain(s) is identified and can be mutated. Also, even with sufficient knowledge to generate such mutants, difficult gene therapy procedures would be required to express these proteins in vivo.Promoter competition strategy has also been utilized whereby plasmids containing cis-acting elements in common with the targeted gene are introduced in high copy number into cells (9Wang X.F. Calame K. Cell. 1986; 47: 241-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At high copy number, a majority of the transcription factors can be competitively bound away from the native enhancer sequences with gene expression accordingly regulated. Because these plasmids must be stably maintained at high copy number in target cells, a requirement that is difficult to achieve in vivo, this approach has also been limiting.Another alternative is to employ oligonucleotides to form triple helices with enhancer elements. Pyrimidine oligonucleotides were found to bind in a sequence-specific dependence to homopurine sites in duplex DNA by triple helix formation and had sufficient specificity and affinity to compete with site-specific DNA binding proteins for occupancy of overlapping target sites (10Maher L.J. Wold B. Dervan P.B. Science. 1989; 245: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). However, such oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation has not been shown in cells in vitro or in vivo.A more successful oligonucleotide-based approach has been the use of synthetic double-stranded phosphorothioate oligonucleotide containing acis-transcription element that can penetrate cells, can bind sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, and can interfere with eukaryotic transcription in vivo (11Bielinska A.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), is palindromic, a synthetic single-stranded oligonucleotide composed of the CRE sequence self-hybridizes to form a duplex/hairpin. We sought to ascertain whether the CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide can penetrate cells, bind sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, and interfere with the CRE-directed transcription in vivo.Because there are many cAMP-regulated genes and because they are ubiquitous in all cell types, the use of CRE decoy could be harmful to cells and organisms. Surprisingly however, the CRE decoys were harmless for normal cells but were potent inhibitors for cancer cell growthin vitro and in vivo.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWe examined whether a 24-mer single-stranded phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide comprising a CRE palindrome (i.e.triplet copies of TGACGTCA, a CRE consensus sequence) can compete for binding the sequence-specific DNA binding proteins. We used32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide (unmodified) that contained the CRE element (Promega) and nuclear extracts from MCF-7 breast cancer cells in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, protein binding to the 32P-labeled CRE probe was inhibited by the unlabeled CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and3) but not by two-base mismatched control oligonucleotide, nonsense-sequence palindrome oligonucleotide containing no CRE, or Oct-1, AP-1, and Sp-1 sequences.We next examined the ability of CRE-decoy oligonucleotide to penetrate cells and compete with the cellular CRE elements for binding transcription factors in vivo. The nuclear extracts from cells treated with the 24-mer CRE oligonucleotide (150 nm, for 2 days) demonstrated a marked decrease in formation of the CRE-protein complex in the mobility shift assay as compared with control (saline-treated) cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4,8, and 12). A CREB (19Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) (CRE-binding protein) antibody caused supershift, indicating the presence of CREB protein within the labeled protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2, 6, and 10). The two-base mismatched control oligonucleotide treatment did not affect the CRE-protein complex formation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3,7, and 11). A Western blot analysis for CREB protein in untreated and in CRE oligo-treated and control oligo-treated cells demonstrated no change in CREB protein level (Fig.1 C), indicating that the CRE-decoy treatment did not affect CREB levels in the cell. These results were demonstrated in MCF-7 (breast carcinoma), MCF-10A (normal human mammary epithelial cell) and LNCaP (prostate carcinoma) cells. The above results demonstrate that the CRE-decoy oligonucleotide successfully competed with the cellular CRE enhancer for binding of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins.We next examined whether CRE oligonucleotides can modulate the transcriptional activity of sequence-specific DNA binding proteinsin vivo. As shown in Fig. 1 D, transfection of MCF-7 cells with somatostatin Δ-71-CAT (20Montminy M.R. Sevarino K.A. Wagner J.A. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Addition of the nonsense-sequence palindromic oligonucleotide that contains no CRE sequence (lane CREC) or the two-base mismatched control oligonucleotide (data not shown), which does not self-hybridize to form a duplex, had no inhibitory effect on the CAT activity. None of the oligonucleotides inhibited the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer (data not shown), which contains no recognizable CRE enhancer element.It was noted that the untreated MCF-7 cells exhibited relatively high levels of basal somatostatin-CAT activity, and forskolin treatment had only a small stimulatory effect (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, LNCaP prostate cancer cells and noncancerous MCF-10A cells exhibited very low levels of basal CAT activity, and forskolin greatly stimulated CAT activity (5–10-fold) (data not shown). This forskolin-stimulated CAT activity was also almost completely abolished by the CRE oligonucleotide treatment (data not shown). The disparity in the basal CAT activity observed in different cells may reflect varying degrees of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation and CREB-phosphorylation in the cell. Significantly, the CRE oligonucleotide was capable of inhibiting both the basal and cAMP-stimulated CAT activities.A group of cAMP-responsive genes, such as somatostatin and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) contain the CRE which lies within the first 150 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the gene (13Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these elements could be regarded as basal enhancer, in addition to functioning as inducible enhancer (1Maniatis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). A role for the CRE as a basal transcription element was suggested in deletion analysis of the PEPCK promoter-regulatory region (22Short J.M. Wynshaw-Boris A. Short H.P. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9721-9726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the CRE was deleted from the promoter, the basal level of gene transcription was reduced, and the responsiveness of the promoter to cAMP in hepatoma cells was abolished. CRE binding protein binds to the CRE in a cAMP-independent manner (13Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Montminy M.R. Bilezikjian L.M. Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). This binding, as it has been proposed (13Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), may stimulate basal transcription by interacting with proximal promoter element, such as the TATA box binding factor and/or RNA polymerase II. The cAMP-induced phosphorylation of CREB could lead to a higher order complex formation with the basic transcription factor. Thus, dual role for the CRE as both a basal and an inducible transcription element has been shown. Importantly, the CRE oligonucleotide interfered with both the basal and cAMP-induced transcription of an exogenously supplied CRE-containing gene (Fig. 1 D).We next examined the ability of CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide to inhibit expression of the endogenous cAMP-responsive genes. The CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide treatment brought about a marked reduction in the mRNA levels of the catalytic (Cα) and regulatory (RIα) subunits of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and PEPCK in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 1 E). In noncancerous MCF-10A cells, the reduction in the mRNA levels was small, although the expression of these genes, particularly of RIα and Cα genes was very low to begin with. In contrast, the control oligonucleotide had no effect on the mRNA levels of the RIα and Cα and PEPCK (Fig. 1 E).PEPCK and the PKA R and C subunit genes are cAMP-inducible genes (13Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Tasken K.A. Knutsen H.K. Attramadal H. Tasken K. Jahnsen T. Hansson V. Eskild W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The promoter region of the porcine RIα gene contains a CRE consensus sequence as well as the AP-2 recognition site (24Nowak I. Seipel K. Schwarz M. Jans D.A. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Transcription factor binding to both of these sequences is believed to be involved in cAMP regulation of gene transcription (13Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The promoters of PKA R and C subunit genes are TATA-less and GC-rich, and multiple transcription initiation sites were identified within the GC-rich region (24Nowak I. Seipel K. Schwarz M. Jans D.A. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Chrivia J.C. Uhler M.D. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5739-5744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such GC-rich regions have been associated with transcription initiation sites of many constitutively expressed housekeeping genes (26Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). Our observation that the CRE oligonucleotide inhibits the basal expression of RIα and Cα genes (Fig.1 E) strongly indicates that the CRE oligonucleotide can indeed compete with the cis-CRE element in binding CREB. Because the CRE oligonucleotide can interfere with CREB binding to thecis-element, it is expected that the oligonucleotide could produce a more profound effect on the mRNA reduction under cAMP-induced conditions. Thus, the CRE oligonucleotide can interfere with both basal and cAMP-induced expression of the endogenous CRE-containing genes.CREB is known to associate with (e.g. heterodimerize) a variety of other transcription factors (e.g. member of the Jun/Fos family) (27Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). The products of the proto-oncogenesjun and fos bind as a heterodimeric complex to a DNA sequence element TRE (AP-1) binding site (28Rauscher F.J. Sambucetti L.C. Curran T. Distel R.J. Spieglman B.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 471-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), whereas CREB-1 homodimer and CREB-2/ATF heterodimer bind the CRE sequence (27Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). However, Jun/Jun homodimer binds to both CRE and TRE (24Nowak I. Seipel K. Schwarz M. Jans D.A. Hemmings B.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and CREB-2 (ATF-2)/Jun heterodimer binds CRE (27Habener J.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 29Ellis M.J.C. Hurst H.C. Goodbourn S.A. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 14: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and c-fos is cAMP-inducible (13Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data clearly demonstrate AP-1 and CRE cross-talk.We therefore examined whether the CRE oligonucleotide treatment affects AP-1 binding. The nuclear extracts from cells treated with the CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide demonstrated a marked reduction in formation of the AP-1 DNA-protein complex in the mobility shift assay compared with control (saline-treated) cells (Fig. 1 F,lane 4). Two-base mismatched control oligonucleotide treatment had no effect on the AP-1 DNA-protein complex formation (Fig.1 F, lane 3). By comparison, CRE-decoy oligonucleotide had no effect on Sp-1 or Oct-1 DNA-protein binding (Fig. 1 F, lanes 8 and 12).We then examined the effect of CRE-decoy oligonucleotide treatment on the expression of c-fos gene that is cAMP responsive (13Roesler W.J. Vandenbark G.R. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9063-9066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 G, the CRE decoy brought about a marked decrease in the TPA-inducible mRNA level of c-fos. The control mismatched oligonucleotide had no effect on the c-fos expression (data not shown). A cAMP-unresponsive gene, such as PKC-α was not affected by the CRE oligonucleotide treatment (Fig. 1 G). These results show that the CRE-decoy oligonucleotide treatment resulted in inhibition of transcription factor binding at two different cis-elements, the CRE and the AP-1.The above results showed that the CRE-decoy oligonucleotides effectively competed with the cellular cis-element for binding the transcription factors and interfered with the function of transactivators in intact cells. To correlate such effects of decoy oligonucleotides with their cellular uptake, we incubated32P-labeled 24-mer CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide or mismatched or nonsense sequence palindromic control oligonucleotide with MCF7 and MCF-10A cells. Cell-associated radioactivity was quantified. Within 5 h, about 10% of the total input oligonucleotide accumulated in the cell and the incorporation continued to rise thereafter, reaching 20–25% maximum levels at 24 h of oligonucleotide incubation (Fig.2 A). The amount and the rate of the incorporation of the oligonucleotides were similar between MCF-7 (Fig. 2A) and MCF-10A (data not shown) cells and between the CRE-decoy oligonucleotide and control oligonucleotide (Fig. 2 A). Cell-associated DNA was isolated and analyzed by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Up to 48 h of examination, the 24-mer CRE oligonucleotide accumulated in MCF-7 cells at a size consistent with the duplex/hairpin forms (Fig. 2 B). Consistent with these data, the 24-mer CRE oligonucleotide exhibited a high melting temperature (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Cellular uptake and stability of CRE oligonucleotide.

In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, within 6 h of treatment with CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide, a strong fluorescence labeling was observed in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig.3, A and B). In addition, a large amount of labeling was also observed in the extracellular space. 12 h after the treatment, the nuclear fluorescence had become much more intense, and the extracellular fluorescence had largely disappeared (Fig. 3,C and D), and by 24 h, the intensity of fluorescence was reduced in both nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 3,E and F). This pattern of fluorescence was also observed in noncancerous MCF-10A cells except that the fluorescence had a more punctated appearance (Fig. 3, G, H,I, and J).

Magnification, × 200.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because there are many cAMP-regulated genes, and they are ubiquitously expressed, we examined whether the CRE oligonucleotide treatment could interfere with cell growth. Surprisingly, the CRE-decoy oligonucleotide produced selective growth inhibition of cancer cells without adversely affecting the normal cell growth (Fig.4 A). The 24-mer CRE-palindromic oligonucleotide produced potent growth inhibition in a variety of cancer cells including MCF-7 (breast cancer), A549 (lung carcinoma), LNCaP (prostate cancer), LS174T and SW480 (colon carcinomas) (data not shown), KB (epidermoid carcinoma) (data not shown), and multidrug-resistant (MDR) cancer lines of MCF7TH (MDR-breast cancer) and HCT-15 (MDR-colon carcinoma) (data not shown). In contrast, the CRE oligonucleotide had little (<20%) or no effect on the growth of noncancerous cells, MCF-10A (human mammary epithelial cell), L132 (human lung epithelial cell), Hs68 (human newborn foreskin fibroblast) (data not shown), and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown). The growth inhibition of cancer cells was achieved at nanomolar concentrations of CRE oligonucleotide (IC50, 100–200 nm) without obvious cytotoxicity and accompanied by changes in cell morphology and appearance of apoptotic nuclei (programmed cell death) (data not shown). The growth inhibition was CRE sequence-specific as the two-base mismatched control oligonucleotide (Fig. 4 A) or the nonsense-sequence palindromic oligonucleotide that contains no CRE sequence (data not shown) had little (<30%) or no growth inhibitory effect.Figure 4CRE oligonucleotide decoy inhibits cancer cell growth in vitroand in vivo. A, cancer cell growth inhibition in vitro. Saline (control), zero concentration (DOTAP treatment only), CRE, or CRE control oligonucleotide-treated cells were harvested after 4 days of treatment, and cell numbers were counted in duplicate by a Coulter Counter (see “Experimental Procedures”). Data represent mean ± S.D. obtained from three independent experiments.B, tumor growth inhibition in vivo. Tumor cells (2 × 106 cells) were inoculated subcutaneously into the left flank of athymic mice. The CRE or control oligonucleotide (CREC) was injected intraperitoneally into nude mice at 0.01–0.1 mg/0. l ml saline/mouse, daily, five times per week for 4 weeks, when tumor size reached 30–50 mg ∼ 10 days after cell inoculation. Tumor volumes were obtained from daily measurements of the longest and shortest diameters and calculated by the formula 4/3 πr 3 where r = (length + width)/4. Data represent means ± S.D. of 5–7 tumors in each group. C, CRE-decoy oligonucleotide does not inhibit the growth of F9 embryonal teratocarcinoma cells. The oligonucleotide treatment and cell number counts were performed as described inpanel A. D, MCF-7 cells harboring mutant KCREB do not respond to CRE-decoy oligonucleotide. MCF-7 cells were transfected with KCREB plasmid, and stable transfectants were used in the experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). The oligonucleotide treatment and cell number counts were performed as described in panel A.Data in panels C and D represent mean ± S.D. obtained from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CRE oligonucleotide treatment also inhibited in vivo tumor growth. Treatment of nude mice bearing HCT-15 human MDR colon carcinoma with 24-mer CRE oligonucleotide (0.1 mg/mouse, intraperitoneal, daily, 5× week for 4 weeks) resulted in greater than 85% inhibition of tumor growth as compared with the saline-treated control tumors without causing systemic toxicity (Fig. 4 B). Two-base mismatched control oligonucleotide had no growth inhibitory effect (Fig.4 B).The growth inhibition may have been because of actions other than blockade of CRE gene transcription, as nonspecific binding of oligonucleotide or its degradation products to biological targets has been shown (30Stein C.A. Nature Med. 1995; 1: 1119-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). As discussed below, however, our data show that the binding of decoy oligonucleotide at the transcription factor DNA-binding domain is clearly related to the inhibition of cell growth. First, in undifferentiated F9 teratocarcinoma cells, a cell line that is unresponsive to cAMP, the CRE decoy produced no growth inhibition (Fig. 4 C). This suggests that the decoy may act as growth inhibitor, at least in part, through binding to CREB because the CRE is nonfunctional in F9 cells although CREB is present (31Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Second, KCREB, a CREB mutant that contains a mutation of a single amino acid in the DNA-binding domain, is known not to bind to native CRE sequences (32Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar). Cancer cells overexpressing KCREB exhibited decreased cell growth as compared with parental cells and showed little or no response to the decoy oligonucleotide treatment (Fig. 4 D).We demonstrated here that the synthetic single-stranded CRE oligonucleotide of palindrome structure functioned as effective and stable transcription factor decoys to alter gene expression in vivo. Importantly, the CRE-decoy oligonucleotides achieved gene-specific regulation in vivo, leading to selective inhibition of cancer cell growth without adversely affecting the growth of normal cells.The specificity of the growth inhibitory effect of the CRE-decoy oligonucleotides on cancer cells is supported by several lines of evidence. (i) The CRE-decoy oligonucleotide produced growth inhibition of cancer cells but not normal cells, in vitro and in vivo, whereas mismatched control oligonucleotides or nonsense-sequence palindromic oligonucleotide that self-hybridizes but contains no CRE, did not inhibit growth. (ii) Administration of CRE-decoy oligonucleotides, but not mismatched oligonucleotides, markedly inhibited CRE DNA-protein complex formation, CR"

Recent studies implicated BTK as a pro-apoptotic enzyme in B-lineage lymphoid cells exposed to ionizing radiation (12Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) as well as mast cells deprived of growth factors (18Kawakami Y. Miura T. Bissonnette R. Hata D. Khan W.N. Kitamura T. Maeda-Yamamoto M. Hartman S.E. Yao L. Alt F.W. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In murine B-cells, BTK has also been shown to act as an anti-apoptotic protein upstream of bcl-xL in the B-cell antigen receptor (but not the CD40 receptor) activation pathway (19Anderson J.S. Teutsch M. Dong Z. Wortis H.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10966-10971Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because of the recently discovered but not well understood ability of BTK to act both as a positive and negative regulator of apoptosis after ionizing radiation, growth factor deprivation, or B-cell antigen receptor signaling and its abundant expression in DT-40 cells (12Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we investigated whether BTK plays a role in the pronounced resistance of DT-40 cells as well as human leukemic B-cell precursors against Fas-mediated apoptosis. Our study provides biochemical and genetic evidence that BTK is an inhibitor the Fas/APO-1 death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) in B-lineage lymphoid cells. BTK associates with Fas via its kinase and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains and prevents the FAS-FADD interaction, which is essential for the recruitment and activation of FLICE by Fas during the apoptotic signal. Notably, treatment of human leukemic B-cell precursors with a potent inhibitor of BTK abrogated the BTK-Fas association and sensitized the cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The establishment of BTK-deficient DT-40 lymphoma B-cell clones has been described previously (12Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To disrupt the btk gene, targeting constructs containing the neomycin resistance gene cassette (i.e. pcBTK-neo) or histidinol resistance gene cassette (i.e. pcBTK-hisD) were sequentially transfected into DT-40 cells. The targeting vectors, pcBTK-neo and pcBTK-hisD, were constructed by replacing the 0.7-kilobaseBglII-BamHI genomic fragment containing exons that correspond to human BTK amino acid residues 91–124 with theneo or hisD cassette. pcBTK-neo was linearized and introduced into wild-type DT-40 cells by electroporation. Screening was done by Southern blot analysis using a 3′-flanking probe (0.5-kilobase BglII-Bgl-II fragment). The neo-targeted clone was again transfected with pcBTK-hisD and selected with both G418 (2 mg/ml) and histidinol (1 mg/ml). Southern blot analysis of a BTK-deficient DT-40 clone confirmed the homologous recombination at both btk loci, and hybridization with a neo and hisD probe indicated that the targeted clone had incorporated a single copy of each construct. Lack of BTK expression in BTK-deficient DT-40 cells was confirmed by both immune complex kinase assays and Western blot analysis (12Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T. Science. 1996; 273: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Mutations in the human btk cDNA were introduced by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Strategene) and confirmed by sequencing. Wild-type and mutantbtk cDNAs were subcloned into pApuro expression vector and electroporated into BTK-deficient cells. The PTK activity of BTK immune complexes, as measured by in vitroautophosphorylation, was abrogated by the catalytic domain mutation, reduced by the PH domain mutation, but not affected by the mutation in the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Equal amounts of BTK protein were detected by Western blot analysis in all of the BTK-deficient DT-40 clones transfected with wild-type or mutated human btkgenes, but no BTK protein was detectable in the untransfected BTK-deficient DT-40 cells (12Uckun F.M.

In addition to these chicken lymphoma B-cells, we also used the following human B-lineage lymphoid cell lines: NALM-6-UM1, a BTK-positive human B-cell precursor (pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia) cell line; RAMOS-1, a BTK-deficient human Burkitt's/B-cell leukemia line; and KL2, a BTK-positive human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed normal B-lymphoblastoid cell line.

Polyclonal antibodies to BTK were generated by immunization of rabbits with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing the first 150 amino acids of BTK. In addition, we used the following anti-BTK antibodies in Western blots of purified fusion proteins: polyclonal goat anti-BTK carboxyl terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), polyclonal goat anti-BTK amino terminus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and polyclonal rabbit serum raised against the BTK SH2-SH3 domains (amino acids 219–377). Polyclonal anti-MBP (maltose-binding protein) antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits. The rabbit polyclonal anti-Fas (sc-715 mixed 1:1 with sc-714), which cross-reacts with both human and chicken Fas proteins, goat polyclonal anti-FADD (sc-1171), goat polyclonal anti-TRADD (sc-1163), and goat polyclonal anti-FLICE (sc-6135) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The monoclonal anti-Fas antibody (F22120) was obtained from the Transduction Laboratories, Inc. (Lexington, KY).

The BTK inhibitor α-cyano-β-methyl-β-hydroxy-N-(2, 5-dibromophenyl)propenamide) (LFM-A13; IC50 for BTK, 2.5 μm; IC50 values for epidermal growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, JAK-1, JAK-2, JAK-3, SYK, HCK, all >300 μm) was a kind gift from Dr. Yaguo Zheng from the Department of Chemistry at the Hughes Institute. The analytical physicochemical data for LMA-13 were: yield: 78% from tetrahydrofuran; mp: 148–150 °C; IR (KBr): 3,353, 2,211, 1,648, and 1,590 cm−1; UV-visible: 220, 245, and 296 nm; 1H NMR (dimethyl sulfoxide-d 6): δ 11.41 (s, 1H, NH), 8.57 (m, 1H, ArH), 7.55 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 1H, ArH), 7.14 (q, J 1 = 6.0 Hz, J 2 = 2.4 Hz, 1H, ArH), 7.10 (s br, 1H, OH), 2.17 (s, 3H, CH3); electron ionization mass spectrometry m/z[M]+: 358. cDNAs encoding full-length BTK and its kinase or PH domains with polymerase chain reaction-generated 5′- and 3′-BamHI sites were cloned into the Escherichia coli expression vector pMAL-C2 with the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible Ptac promoter to create an in-frame fusion between these coding sequences and the 3′-end of the E. coli malE gene, which codes for MBP. cDNAs encoding the SH2, SH3, or SH2+SH3 domains with polymerase chain reaction-generated 5′- and 3′-BamHI sites were cloned into the E. coli expression vector pGEX-2t with the isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible Ptac promoter to create an in-frame fusion between these coding sequences and the 3′-end of the E. coli GST gene. The generated recombinant plasmids were transformed into the E. colistrain DH5α. Single transformants were expanded in 5 ml of Luria-Burtain (LB) medium (1% tryptone, 1% NaCl, 0.5% yeast extract) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) by overnight culture at 37 °C. Expression of the fusion proteins was induced with 10 mmisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,500 × g in a Sorvall RC5B centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C, lysed in sucrose-lysozyme buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm lysozyme), and disrupted further by sonication. After removal of the cell pellets by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, GST-BTK fusion proteins were purified by gluthathione-Sepharose chromatography (21Uckun F.M. Tuel-Ahlgren L.

Wild-type and BTK-deficient DT-40 cells treated with anti-Fas antibody (1 μg/ml, 24 h at 37 °C) were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and fixed in ice-cold (−20 °C) methanol for 15 min. After fixation, the coverslips were washed for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were stained with a rabbit polyclonal anti-tubulin antibody according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma) to visualize their cytoplasms. DNA was labeled for 10 min with Toto-3, a DNA specific dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) to visualize the apoptotic changes in the nuclei. MBP-BTK-electroporated BTK-deficient DT-40 cells and nonelectroporated BTK-deficient DT-40 cells were labeled with an antibody raised against MBP. The secondary antibody was a goat anti-rabbit fluorescein-conjugated antibody. In some experiments, cells were examined for Fas expression by confocal microscopy. In brief, cells were attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and fixed for 40 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Cells were rinsed in PBS + 115 mmglycine to quench the formaldehyde and then blocked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (PBS+BSA). A monoclonal antibody raised against the extracellular domain of Fas (Transduction Labs, Lexington, KY) was added in PBS+BSA, and the coverslips were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C before rinsing again in PBS. A fluorescein-labeled secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco) diluted in PBS+BSA was then added to the coverslips, and they were again incubated for 40 min at 37 °C. After another wash, cellular DNA was labeled by incubation in 1 μm Toto-3 for 20 min at room temperature. Coverslips were inverted and mounted onto slides in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) to prevent photobleaching and were sealed with nail varnish. Slides were examined using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope mounted on an Nikon Eclipse E-800 upright microscope equipped for epifluorescence with high numerical aperture objectives (27Uckun F.M.

Optical sections were obtained and turned into stereomicrographs using Lasersharp software (Bio-Rad). Representative digital images were saved to Jaz disk and processed using Adobe Photoshop software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View CA). Images were printed with a Fuji Pictography thermal transfer printer (Fuji Photo, Elmsford, NY). Digital data were archived and stored on CD-ROM. To induce apoptosis, cells were treated with an agonistic anti-Fas/APO-1 antibody (Bender MedSystems) at a 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 μg/ml final concentration. MC540 binding (as an early marker of apoptosis) and propidium iodide (PI) permeability (as a marker of advanced stage apoptosis) were measured simultaneously in DT-40 cells 24 h after exposure to anti-Fas antibody, as described previously (12Uckun F.M.

Whole cells were analyzed with a FACStar Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). All analyses were done using 488 nm excitation from an argon laser. MC540 and PI emissions were split with a 600 nm short pass dichroic mirror. A 575 nm band pass filter was placed in front of one photomultiplier tube to measure MC540 emission, and a 635 nm band pass filter was used for PI emission. To detect apoptotic fragmentation of DNA, DT-40, NALM-6-UM1, and RAMOS-1 cells were harvested 24 h after exposure to anti-Fas. DNA was prepared from Triton X-100 lysates for analysis of fragmentation (12Uckun F.M. Waddick K.G. Mahajan S. Jun X. Takata M. Bolen J. Kurosaki T.

In brief, cells were lysed in hypotonic 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100 detergent and subsequently centrifuged at 11,000 × g. To detect apoptosis-associated DNA fragmentation, supernatants were electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, and the DNA fragments were visualized by ultraviolet light after staining with ethidium bromide. In some experiments, MBP-BTK fusion proteins (100 μg/2.5 × 108 cells) were electroporated (420-V electrical field, 125 microfarads) into BTK-deficient DT-40 cells using a Bio-Rad gene pulser and the procedures of Bergland and Starkey (28Bergland D.

It has been shown that in adipocytes under normal conditions, Glut4 is localized in an intracellular microsomal compartment, “Glut4-containing vesicles,” which are translocated to the plasma membrane in response to insulin. Because total glucose uptake into insulin-sensitive tissues is, in general, proportional to the amount of Glut4 molecules at the cell surface, this translocation process is usually considered as the major mechanism of insulin action on glucose transport. The protein composition of Glut4-containing vesicles is now rather well characterized. Besides Glut4, they include a novelinsulin-regulatedaminopeptidase (IRAP), the IGFII/Man 6-phosphate 1The abbreviations used are: IGF II, insulin-like growth factor; Glut4-vesicle, Glut4-containing vesicle; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LM, light microsome; MBP, myelin basic protein. receptor, the transferrin receptor, and a recently cloned protein, sortilin (reviewed in Refs. 9Kandror K.V.

Insulin administration to cells may release this trafficking block by, for example, removal of an endogenous inhibitor from Glut4-containing vesicles, or by disassociating these vesicles from an intracellular anchor, thus leading to their default fusion with the plasma membrane. Indirect support for this hypothesis derives from recent data showing that the introduction of the cytoplasmic portion of several vesicular proteins, such as Glut4 (15Lee W. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21427-21431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or IRAP (16Waters S.B. D'Auria M. Martin S.S. Nguyen C. Kozma L.M. Luskey K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23323-23327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), causes Glut4 translocation to the plasma membrane, presumably as a result of competing with the endogenous proteins for the putative inhibitor or anchoring protein. After the trafficking block is released, Glut4-vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, most likely, via a v-SNARE/t-SNARE-mediated process (reviewed in Ref.8Rea S. James D.E. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A major question in the field that still remains to be resolved is the signal transduction pathway that couples activated insulin receptor with the Glut4-containing compartment (vesicles) and triggers its recruitment to the plasma membrane. At present, we know only about the upstream part of this pathway: insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrates, PI 3-kinase, PDK1, and Akt/PK B (17Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Cross D.A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The downstream signaling components, proximal to Glut4-vesicles, remain unknown. We show here that Glut4-containing vesicles immunoisolated from rat adipocytes possess a tightly associated protein kinase activity and several phosphorylation substrates. The vesicle-associated protein kinase has been identified as Akt-2 by MonoQ chromatography and Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of vesicle component proteins as well as artificial substrates by the vesicle-associated protein kinase is rapidly increased by insulin in a wortmannin-sensitive fashion. These data may provide a missing link in the insulin signal transduction pathway by directly coupling Glut4-containing vesicles to the previously established enzymatic cascade. In the present study, we used the monoclonal anti-GLUT4 antibody 1F8 (18James D.E. Brown R. Navarro J. Pilch P.F. Nature. 1988; 333: 183-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), the anti-SCAMPs antibody 3F8 (19Thoidis G. Kotliar N. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11691-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the anti-Akt-2 sheep antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Adipocytes were isolated from the epididymal fat pads of male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by collagenase digestion (20Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transferred to KRP buffer (12.5 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, 6 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mmNa2HPO4, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, 2.5 mmd-glucose, 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). Insulin was administered to cells (where indicated) to a final concentration of 10 nm. After that, KCN was added to cells to final concentration of 2 mm for 5 min, cells were washed three or four times with HES buffer cooled to 14–16 °C (20 mmHEPES, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm leupeptin, pH 7.4), homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon pestle, and subcellular fractions were prepared as described previously (21Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cushman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In some experiments, phosphatase inhibitors (a mixture of 25 mm Na4P2O7, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm Na3VO4) were added to homogenization buffer with no significant effect. Isolated membrane fractions were resuspended in PBS, which contained all of the protease inhibitors listed above. Protein A-purified 1F8 antibody, as well as nonspecific mouse IgG (Sigma), were each coupled to acrylic beads (Reacti-gel GF 2000, Pierce) at a concentration 0.4 and 0.6 mg of antibody/ml of resin, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Before usage, the beads were saturated with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for at least 1 h and washed with PBS. The light microsomes (LMs) from rat adipocytes were incubated separately with each of the specific and nonspecific antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with PBS and twice with protein kinase buffer (10 mmTris, 10 mm KCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, pH 7.8), and the adsorbed material was used for phosphorylation experiments as described in the following paragraph. [γ-32P]ATP (50–100 μm, 300–5000 cpm/pmol) and phosphorylation substrates (as specified separately for each experiment) were added to Glut4-containing vesicles immunoadsorbed on the beads (see the previous paragraph) in protein kinase buffer. To provide an efficient mixing, the volume of the liquid phase exceeded the volume of settled beads 2-fold. This suspension was intensively shaken for 30 min at room temperature, and immunobeads were separated from the liquid phase. Beads were then washed twice from the excess of radioactive ATP with protein kinase buffer and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and eluted with either 1% Triton X-100 in protein kinase buffer or Laemmli sample buffer without 2-mercaptoethanol. In the experiments when exogenous protein substrates were added to protein kinase assay, 50-μl aliquots of the liquid phase were applied on 2 × 2 cm squares of Whatman P81 chromatography paper, washed three times with 75 mmphosphoric acid, and counted in a scintillation counter by Cherenkov. Alternatively, phosphorylated proteins were electrophoresed, and dried gels were exposed in a storage phosphor screen cassette and quantitated in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In cases when the exogenous substrates were represented by short synthetic peptides, bovine serum albumin (final concentration, 1%) and trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%) was added to samples, which were then applied on Whatman P81 paper and processed as described above. To separate proteins by anion exchange chromatography, membrane samples were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 for at least 2 h at 4 °C, centrifuged, and applied to a 1-ml Amersham Pharmacia Biotech MonoQ column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0. Elution was carried out with a linear gradient of NaCl (final concentration, 0.5 m; total volume of the gradient, 30 ml) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Thirty 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed for the total protein content and protein kinase activity. Concentration of NaCl in the gradient fractions was re-evaluated with the help of a digital conductivity meter (VWR). No Triton X-100 was present in the samples or in the buffers upon fractionation of cytosolic fractions. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels according to Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), but without reducing agents, and were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine. Following transfer, the membrane was blocked with 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Proteins were visualized with specific antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and an enhanced chemiluminescent substrate kit (NEN Life Science Products). Autoradiograms were normally exposed overnight in a storage phosphor screen cassette and quantitated in a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Protein content was determined with a BCA kit (Pierce) according to manufacturer's instructions. Glut4-containing vesicles were immunoadsorbed from intracellular membranes of rat adipose cells treated and not treated with insulin, and [γ-32P]ATP was added directly to the material adsorbed on the beads as described under “Materials and Methods.” Under these conditions, radioactive phosphate is incorporated into several proteins in Glut4-vesicles. Although the pattern of minor phosphorylated proteins varies to some extent in different experiments, we consistently detect phosphorylation of polypeptides with molecular masses 110, 50, 39, and 25 kDa (Fig.1 A). Insulin stimulation of adipocytes for 15 min results in the significant (p < 0.01) increase in the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into these proteins 1.8 ± 0.3, 2.1 ± 0.5, 2.8 ± 0.4, and 3.2 ± 1.3-fold, correspondingly. The electrophoretic mobility of three of the phosphorylated substrates completely matches that of the major constituents of Glut4-vesicles, gp110, or sortilin (11Lin B.-Z. Pilch P.F. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24145-24147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), Glut4, and the high molecular mass isoform of the SCAMP triplet, p39 (19Thoidis G. Kotliar N. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11691-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To further identify these proteins, 1F8-bound material from insulin-stimulated cells was subsequently eluted with PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and, after that, with Laemmli sample buffer. As we have shown earlier (13Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), under these conditions, all vesicular proteins with the exception for Glut4 can be recovered in the Triton eluate, whereas Glut4 is resistant to Triton elution and can be removed from immunobeads only with SDS-containing Laemmli sample buffer. Triton eluate from 1F8 beads was used for immunoprecipitation of SCAMPs according to the previously published protocol (19Thoidis G. Kotliar N. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11691-11696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, phosphorylated Glut4 was detected in the SDS eluate from 1F8 beads, whereas phosphorylated SCAMPs were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and were immunoprecipitated with the specific antibodies (Fig.1 B). The nature of the low molecular mass phosphorylated protein (p25) remains unknown (see “Discussion”). Several other phosphorylated bands can be noticed on the autoradiogram shown in Fig.1 A, including those with the molecular masses over 200 kDa and below 20 kDa. Electrophoretic mobilities of these proteins correspond to that of the known components of Glut4-vesicles: the IGFII/Man 6-phosphate receptor (p230) (23Kandror K.V. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21703-21708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and VAMP (p18) (24Cain C.C. Trimble W.S. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11681-11684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We are currently trying to identify these proteins. Along with protein kinase(s), Glut4-containing vesicles may also contain an endogenous phosphatase activity, which may alter the results of the in vitro phosphorylation. To check this possibility, Glut4-vesicles were immunoadsorbed from insulin-treated and untreated cells, phosphorylated in vitro as described above, thoroughly washed of radioactive ATP, and incubated under the same conditions for another hour. This additional incubation in the absence of ATP does not change the total pattern of phosphorylation or specific incorporation of radioactive phosphate into individual proteins (not shown). In the next experiments, we explored the substrate specificity of the vesicle-associated protein kinase. As is shown in Fig.2, myelin basic protein (MBP) was phosphorylated to a greater extent than other substrates analyzed. A small amount incorporation of radioactive phosphate into total fraction of histones (Sigma) was also detected. On the other hand, neither casein nor a synthetic peptide corresponding to the phosphorylation site on the regulatory p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase (25Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) was phosphorylated by a vesicle-associated protein kinase (Fig. 2), although it could be phosphorylated by immunoprecipitated PI 3-kinase. 2S. Heydrick and K. V. Kandror, unpublished observations. This, together with other evidence (see Fig. 5), suggests that PI 3-kinase which, in a recent study, was found to be associated with Glut4-containing vesicles in an insulin-dependent manner (26Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10200-10204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), does not phosphorylate their component proteins in vitro. It was also found that the vesicle-associated protein kinase is fairly specific for ATP and cannot use GTP, taken at an equal concentration (data not shown).Figure 5Wortmannin inhibits insulin-dependent activation of the vesicle-associated protein kinase in vivo, but not in vitro. Left panel, LMs (0.15 mg of protein) from adipocytes untreated and treated with insulin for 2 min were immunoadsorbed with 50 μl of 1F8 beads and phosphorylated in vitro in the absence or in the presence of 5 μm wortmannin.Right panel, adipocytes were pre-incubated with 100 nm wortmannin (where indicated) for 20 min before insulin administration for 2 min, and Glut4-vesicles were immunoadsorbed and phosphorylated in vitro as described in the legend to theleft panel. The positions of the molecular mass standards are shown on the right. A representative result of four independent experiments is shown. Quantitation of the results shown in the right panel of the figure is presented in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As an additional control for phosphatase activity, in vitrophosphorylated MBP was incubated with Glut4-containing vesicles immunoadsorbed from insulin-treated and not treated cells. No dephosphorylation of 32P-labeled MBP was detected under these conditions (not shown). Because cytosolic proteins can, theoretically, be nonspecifically associated with the immunoadsorbed material and dissociate with an increase in the ionic strength of the washing buffer, it seemed essential to determine how tightly the endogenous protein kinase is associated with Glut4-containing vesicles. Fig.3 shows that extensive wash of immunoadsorbed Glut4-containing vesicles with a high ionic strength buffer cannot remove endogenous protein kinase activity from this compartment and does not change the pattern of phosphorylated proteins. As is shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, some increase in the activity of the vesicle-associated protein kinase always takes place after adipocytes are stimulated by insulin for 15 min. This time point was chosen because the effect of insulin on Glut4 recruitment to the plasma membrane reaches the maximum at about this time (for recent study see Ref. 27Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, activation of the vesicle-associated protein kinase may precede vesicle translocation. Thus, we immunoadsorbed Glut4-containing vesicles from adipocytes treated with insulin for 2, 4, 8, and 16 min and determined the level of protein kinase activity in this material. Fig. 4 A shows that phosphorylation of the vesicle proteins by the endogenous protein kinase is rapidly increased by insulin and then gradually declines after 2 min of insulin stimulation. In this and other (Figs. 1, 3, and 5) experiments, however, the effect of insulin on phosphorylation of Glut4-containing vesicles in vitro may and should depend on the phosphorylation status of the substrate proteins in living cells, which is hard if not impossible to measure. In other words, if insulin causes dephosphorylation of Glut4-containing vesicles in vivo, we may see an increase in their phosphorylation in vitro even if the level of the vesicle-associated protein kinase activity stays the same. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we measured the activity of this protein kinase toward an exogenous substrate, MBP (Fig.4 B). Because the pattern of MBP phosphorylation mirrors the incorporation of radioactive phosphate into component proteins of Glut4-vesicles (Fig. 4 A) and given the lack of the detectable phosphatase in this preparation, we conclude that protein kinase activity associated with Glut4-vesicles is indeed stimulated by insulin with the maximum at 2 min after insulin administration. Thus, in all following experiments, the effect of insulin on phosphorylation of Glut4-vesicles was measured after 2 min of insulin treatment. To determine whether vesicle-associated protein kinase may participate in the transduction of the hormonal signal from the cell surface to its final target: Glut4-containing vesicles, we carried out experiments with wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase and its downstream signaling. The left panel of Fig.5 demonstrates that the addition of wortmannin (5 μm) to the in vitro protein kinase assay has no effect on phosphorylation of vesicle proteins by the endogenous protein kinase. This result provides additional evidence that Ser/Thr kinase activity of PI 3-kinase is not responsible for phosphorylation of Glut4-vesicles. In analogous experiments, we have shown that neither PK I (an inhibitor of protein kinase A) nor calphostin C (an inhibitor of protein kinase C) has any effect on the pattern of phosphorylated proteins in Glut4-vesicles (not shown). In contrast, wortmannin in a much lower concentration (100 nm) was able to prevent insulin-stimulated increase in phosphorylation of different proteins in Glut4-vesicles when added to adipose cellsin vivo, 20 min prior to insulin administration (Fig. 5,right panel, and Table I).Table IThe effect of wortmannin on insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Glut4-containing vesicles by an endogenous protein kinaseProtein− Wortmannin+ Wortmanninp1103.5 ± 2.10.9 ± 0.3p607.6 ± 0.91.1 ± 0.2p50 (Glut4)6.2 ± 1.81.1 ± 0.4p39 (SCAMP)4.8 ± 0.91.2 ± 0.3p255.3 ± 1.51.3 ± 0.4The table represents quantitation of the data shown in Fig. 5(right panel).

The numbers are the mean values ± S.E. of four independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The table represents quantitation of the data shown in Fig. 5(right panel). It demonstrates the increase in phosphorylation of the individual proteins of Glut4-containing vesicles (fold stimulation) by an endogenous protein kinase after insulin administration to adipocytes for 2 min in the absence and in the presence of 100 nm wortmannin. The numbers are the mean values ± S.E. of four independent experiments. Data shown in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that the vesicle-associated protein kinase may participate in the insulin signaling downstream of PI 3-kinase. Moreover, in these experiments we have detected a protein with the molecular mass of 60 kDa, the phosphorylation of which is transiently activated by insulin in a wortmannin-sensitive fashion. After 2 min of insulin stimulation, p60 represents one of the major phosphorylated proteins in Glut4-vesicles, whereas after 15 min of insulin treatment its phosphorylation is hardly detectable (compare Figs. 4 and 5 with Figs. 1 and 3). The molecular mass of this protein corresponds well to that of the newly described lipid-binding Ser/Thr protein kinase, Akt. As has recently been shown, Akt is activated by insulin in adipose and muscle cells (28Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to check whether Akt is directly present in Glut4-containing vesicles. As is seen in Fig.6, Glut4-vesicles include visible amounts of Akt-2, an isoform of the enzyme that is predominant in adipocytes (36Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These data correspond well to recent results of Calera et al. (37Calera M.R. Martinez C. Liu H. Jack A.K. El Birnbaum M.J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7201-7204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), who demonstrated by immunoadsorption and sucrose gradient centrifugation that Akt-2 may interact with Glut4-containing vesicles in an insulin- and wortmannin-sensitive fashion. Note, that according to Western blot analysis, only a small portion (5–7%) of the total cellular Akt-2 was recovered in the fraction of light microsomes with the major pool of the enzyme being localized in the cytosol. Of this membrane-associated enzyme, 3–4% was found in Glut4-containing vesicles (Fig. 6). However, it is still an open question as to what portion of the LM fraction represents membranes and what portion is accounted for by ribosomes, cytoskeleton, heavy protein complexes, etc., that are also pelleted under conditions used to purify so-called “light microsomes” (38Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, Fig. 6 may considerably underrepresent the fraction of the total membrane-associated Akt-2 that is present in Glut4-containing vesicles. Glut4-containing vesicles from insulin-treated cells contain at least three times more Akt-2 than vesicles from basal cells (Fig. 6). This is consistent with our data about insulin-stimulated increase in phosphorylation of vesicle proteins (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) and suggests that this phenomenon is likely to be explained by recruiting more active Akt-2 onto Glut4-vesicles. To estimate to what extent Akt-2 associated with Glut4-containing vesicles can account for the total protein kinase activity present in this compartment, we immunoadsorbed Glut4-containing vesicles on 1F8 beads, solubilized their component proteins with 1% Triton, fractionated this material on a MonoQ column, and determined protein kinase activity in the chromatorgaphic fractions using MBP as a substrate (Fig. 7, top panel). In parallel, we fractionated Triton-solubilized total LMs from adipose cells on the same column under the same experimental conditions and determined the position of Akt-2 by Western blotting (Fig. 7,bottom panel). As is seen in Fig. 7, the major peak of the protein kinase activity associated with Glut4-containing vesicles is eluted in fractions 5 and 6, which exactly corresponds to the position of the membrane-associated Akt-2. Thus, we conclude that Akt-2 is responsible for the major part of the total MBP kinase activity present in Glut4-vesicles. To prove that Akt-2 can phosphorylate component proteins of Glut4-vesicles, we have purified this enzyme from the cytos"
https://openalex.org/W2027729471,"Agonist-induced phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors has been shown to facilitate the desensitization processes, such as receptor internalization, decreased efficiency of coupling to G-proteins, or decreased ligand affinity. The lowered affinity may be an intrinsic property of the phosphorylated receptor or it may be the result of altered interactions between the modified receptor and downstream components such as G-proteins or arrestins. To address this issue, we purified cAR1, the major chemoattractant receptor of Dictyostelium discoideum by a strategy that is independent of the ligand binding capacity of the receptor. To our knowledge, this represents the first successful purification of a chemoattractant receptor. The hexyl-histidine-tagged receptor was solubilized from a highly enriched plasma membrane preparation and purified by Ni2+-chelating chromatography. The protocol offers a simple way to purify 100-500 micrograms of a G-protein coupled receptor that can be targeted to the plasma membrane of D. discoideum. The Kd value for the purified cAR1 was about 200 nM, consistent with that of receptors that are not coupled to G-proteins in intact cells. In contrast, the affinity of phosphorylated cAR1, purified from desensitized cells, was about three times lower. Treatment of the phosphorylated receptor with protein phosphatases caused dephosphorylation and parallel restoration of higher affinity. We propose that ligand-induced phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors causes a decrease in intrinsic affinity and may be useful in maintaining the receptor's sensitivity at high agonist levels. This affinity decrease may precede other processes such as receptor internalization or uncoupling from G-proteins."

To identify proteins that interact with ERK7, we utilized a yeast two-hybrid screen with the COOH-terminal tail of ERK7 as bait and isolated the cDNA for a novel protein termed CLIC3.

Taken together, these results suggest that CLIC3 is a new member of the human CLIC family.

Although the majority of chloride channels characterized to date have been localized to the plasma membrane (9Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), a new family of proteins that activate intracellular chloride permeability has been identified within the past few years. Termed the “chloride intracellular channel” or CLIC 1The abbreviations used are: CLIC, chloride intracellular channel; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HA, hemagglutinin; Ω, ohm(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. family (10Heiss N.S. Poustka A. Genomics. 1997; 45: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), at least two members have been described. The CLIC family has homology to p64, a bovine kidney microsomal chloride ion transporter characterized by Landry and colleagues (11Landry D.W. Reitman M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Al-Awqati Q. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 779-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Landry D.W. Akabas M.H. Redhead C. Edelman A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Al-Awqati Q.

A rat homologue of p64 (p64G1) has also been cloned and shown to play a role in intracellular chloride ion transport within the endoplasmic reticulum (14Duncan R.R. Westwood P.K. Boyd A. Ashley R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23880-23886Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The highly related but distinct CLIC class of chloride ion transporters shares homology with the COOH-terminal half of p64 (10Heiss N.S. Poustka A. Genomics. 1997; 45: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The prototype for this family is NCC27/CLIC1 (15Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a small protein of 241 amino acids that is expressed primarily in the nucleus and exhibits both nuclear and plasma membrane chloride ion channel activity. CLIC2, a 243-amino acid protein that shares a putative nuclear localization signal, has not yet been characterized but has been mapped to a region of the chromosome that codes for proteins important in a number of diseases. Although the specific function of these proteins is not yet known, their high degree of conservation and unusual cellular localization suggest that they play a central role in cellular function. Since the CLIC proteins lack the membrane-spanning domains characteristic of channel proteins and are largely intracellular, it is possible that they are not themselves chloride channels but instead function as activators of chloride channels. There is increasing evidence indicating that cellular signaling cascades play a fundamental role as regulators of ion channels. For example, the high voltage-activated Ca2+ channel and Ca2+-activated K+ channels can be modulated by growth factors (16Wildering W.C. Lodder J.C. Kits K.S. Bulloch A.G. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 2778-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Holmes T.C. Berman K. Swartz J.E. Dagan D. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8964-8974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both NMDA receptors and the human Kv1.5 K+ channel were shown to be regulated by the tyrosine kinase Src (18Holmes T.C. Fadool D.A. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1581-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yu X.M. Askalan R. Keil II, G.J. Salter M.W. Science. 1997; 275: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). In lymphocytes, the tyrosine kinase p561ckmediates activation of a swelling-activated chloride channel (20Lepple-Wienhues A. Szabo I. Laun T. Kaba N.K. Gulbins E. Lang F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and also activates an outwardly rectifying chloride channel during Fas-mediated apoptosis (21Szabo I. Lepple-Wienhues A. Kaba K.N. Zoratti M. Gulbins E. Lang F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6169-6174Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how signaling pathways modulate chloride channels. One of the major signaling cascades activated by growth and differentiating factors in cells is the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade. A superfamily of highly homologous proline-directed serine/threonine kinases, MAP kinases are regulated through distinct signaling cascades involving upstream protein kinases that phosphorylate both tyrosine and threonine residues in a Thr-X-Tyr (TXY) motif positioned within the activation loop of MAP kinases (reviewed in Ref. 22Cobb M.H. Xu S. Cheng M. Ebert D. Robbins D. Goldsmith E. Robinson M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 36: 49-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recently, a novel 60-kDa member of the MAP kinase family, termed extracellular signal-regulated kinase 7 (ERK7), has been cloned and characterized (23Abe M.K. Kuo W.-L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Although it has the signature TEY activation motif of ERK1 and ERK2, ERK7 is significantly different from previously identified ERKs. First, ERK7 does not appear to be activated either by extracellular stimuli that typically activate ERK1 or ERK2 or by common activators of the JNK or p38 pathways. Instead, this novel MAP kinase has appreciable constitutive activity in serum-starved cells, and this activity requires the presence of a COOH-terminal tail. Second, the enzyme is expressed in the nucleus in a COOH-terminal tail-dependent fashion. Finally, ERK7 can function as a negative regulator of cell growth, and this activity is dependent on the presence of the COOH-terminal tail but independent of its kinase activity. Taken together, these results describe a new type of MAP kinase family member whereby interactions via its COOH-terminal tail, rather than extracellular signal-mediated activation cascades, regulate its activity, its localization, and its function. In order to elucidate the mechanism by which ERK7 is regulated, we identified proteins that interact with the COOH-terminal tail of ERK7 using a two-hybrid screen. In the present study, we describe the isolation and characterization of a new member of the CLIC family of intracellular chloride channels termed CLIC3 that specifically associates with ERK7. Like NCC27/CLIC1, CLIC3 is a small protein that is localized primarily in the nucleus and stimulates chloride ion channel activity. The observed association of CLIC3 with a member of the MAP kinase family, in conjunction with the nuclear localization of both of these proteins, raises the possibility that CLIC3 may participate in cellular growth control. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Sigma. Monoclonal antibody (12CA5) against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was purchased from Babco (Emeryville, CA). High affinity rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody (3F10) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Antibody against the FLAG-epitope M5 was purchased from IBI (Eastman Kodak). Enhanced Chemiluminescence Reagents were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. The pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vector was a gift from V. Sukhatme. Plasmid DNAs were purified using a Qiagen kit or by CsCl-ethidium bromide gradient centrifugation as described previously (24Kuo W.-L. Gehm B.D. Rosner M.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNAs were sequenced by the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research DNA sequencing core laboratory at the University of Florida or by the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center DNA sequencing facility. TheBamHI-NotI fragment of ERK7 comprising the COOH-terminal tail (23Abe M.K. Kuo W.-L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar) was subcloned into a Bluescript II KS(+) vector to construct plasmid pB-ERK7. The EcoRI-NotI fragment with ERK7 from pB-ERK7 was fused into a LexA DNA binding domain in pEG202, resulting in the pEG202-ERK7 construct. The human fetal brain library, kindly provided by Dr. Roger Brent, was made from a 22-week-old human fetal frontal cortex and was used to search for novel proteins that interact with ERK7. In a screen of ∼1×106 primary transformants, two clones (S9 and S46) showing strong interaction with ERK7 were obtained. Yeast transformation and routine yeast work were performed as described (25Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). The EcoRI fragment from pCLIC3 plasmid was isolated and radiolabeled with 32P using the Megaprime DNA labeling system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized to a poly(A)+ RNA human multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH). Hybridization was performed according to the user manual (CLONTECH). Primer A (5′-ATGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGTCCTGCTCCTCAAGGGCGTACCTTTCACCCTCACCACGGTG-3′) and primer B (5′-GCTCGAGGACAAAGATGCCTTTATTGG-3′) were used to clone the CLIC3 from S9 cDNA by PCR with ID Proof Taq (ID Lab). The PCR products were ligated into the pCR3.1 TA vector (Invitrogen) to construct pCLIC3. Primer A included nucleotides coding for the FLAG epitope right after the ATG codon and the 23 nucleotides missing in the 5′ end of S9 cDNA. The EcoRI fragment containing CLIC3 was subcloned into a pGEX-2T vector to express the GST-CLIC3 fusion protein in bacterial BL21 cells. GST fusion proteins were prepared using a GST purification system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An HA tag, YPYDVPDY, was inserted right after the initiating methionine of ERK7 by PCR (23Abe M.K. Kuo W.-L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). The HA-K43R ERK7 mutant was generated by unique site elimination mutagenesis (26Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). COS, CV-1, and LTK cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) and 10% fetal bovine serum in a 95% air, 5% CO2incubator at 37 °C. COS and CV-1 cells were transfected with a total of 10 μg of plasmid DNA, and transfection was performed with the TransITTM polyamine transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Panvera, Madison, WI). The LipofectAMINETM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for transfection of LTK cells. The pGreen Lantern–1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the pCMV-β-galactosidase expression vectors were co-transfected with other plasmids as markers for visualizing transfected cells or as indicators of transfection efficiency. Cultured cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1% Triton-based lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 mm ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate. Cell extracts were separated on 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (27Abe M.K. Chao T.-S.O. Solway J. Rosner M.R. Hershenson M.B. Am. J. Resp. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (28Kuo W.-L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E.M. McCarthy S.A. Yan M. Templeton D.J. McMahon M. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1458-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In order to assay ERK7 kinase activity, COS cells were transfected with HA-ERK7 or HA-ERK7-K43R. After 24–48 h, cells were lysed in 0.5% Triton X-100 buffer, and ERK7 and ERK7-K43R were immunoprecipitated using the anti-HA antibody. The immune complex was washed three times with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm ρ-nitrophenyl phosphate). 2 μg of each substrate were used per reaction in kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The kinase reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and terminated by boiling the mixtures in sample buffer for 5 min. The reaction products were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The CV-1 cells were plated on coverslips and incubated overnight. Cells were transfected with FLAG-CLIC3 and pCMV-β-galactosidase or HA-ERK7 using the TransIT-LT1 reagent. After 48 h, the cells were fixed in 10% formaldehyde solution (Fisher) for 15 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked, and incubated simultaneously with mouse anti-FLAG M5 antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-β-galactosidase antibody (5 Prime→ 3 Prime, Boulder, CO) or rat high affinity anti-HA antibody. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the cells were washed and then incubated with Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The stained cells were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope. LTK cells were transfected with both FLAG-CLIC3 and GFP or with GFP alone. Electrophysiological experiments were performed 48–72 h after transfection. Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence. Membrane voltage was controlled with a voltage clamp in the whole-cell, tight-seal configuration (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15170) Google Scholar). The resistance was 2–3 MΩ. Patch pipettes contained (in mm): KCl, 135; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; K2-EGTA, 10; HEPES, 10; adjusted to pH 7.2 by the addition of KOH. The standard extracellular saline contained (in mm): NaCl, 140; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 3; MgCl2, 2; glucose, 15; HEPES, 10; adjusted to pH 7.4 by the addition of NaOH. A low chloride saline was made by substituting NaCl with sodium gluconate. Membrane potential was normally held at −70 mV. A current-voltage relation was measured by recording the current while the voltage was changed between −100 and +80 mV at a constant rate of 1.4 V s−1. No correction was made for the series resistance of the patch pipette. Junction potentials were corrected as described in Ref. 30Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar. Currents were low pass-filtered (8-pole with 3 db attenuation at 3 kHz), digitized at 2 KHz, and subsequently analyzed with custom software written in Axobasic (Axon Instruments Inc.). In order to elucidate the mechanism by which the COOH-terminal tail of ERK7 regulates ERK7 activity and function, we screened for interacting proteins using the LexA-based yeast two-hybrid system (25Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). A restriction fragment of the ERK7 cDNA containing the COOH-terminal tail was used as bait for screening a human fetal brain library. Two cDNA clones (S9 and S46) out of ∼1 × 106 transformants interacted strongly with the tail of ERK7 but not with other unrelated control proteins (data not shown). Sequence analysis indicated that both of these clones contained the same partial-length cDNA and were missing 23 nucleotides at the 5′ end of the full-length cDNA. Searching the human EST Data Base revealed an overlapping cDNA clone (gb/N41765) that was missing the 3′ end but had the complete 5′ end of the gene. Together, the cDNA sequences from S9 and the EST clones encoded a polypeptide of 208 amino acids with a predicted M r of 23,569. The potential initiating methionine codon is right after a stop codon in the same reading frame and occurs in a consensus region favorable for initiation of translation in higher eukaryotes (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4170) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the protein encoded by the S9 clone. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence to other sequences in the Swiss Protein Data Base revealed a significant homology to human chloride intracellular channel 1 (NCC27/CLIC1) (15Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and chloride intracellular channel 2 (CLIC2) (10Heiss N.S. Poustka A. Genomics. 1997; 45: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by S9 had 48–49% identity and 60–61% similarity to NCC27/CLIC1 and CLIC2. Furthermore, the S9 protein shared 47% identity and 60% similarity with the COOH-terminal half of the bovine chloride channel p64 (11Landry D.W. Reitman M. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Al-Awqati Q. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 779-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 12Landry D.W. Akabas M.H. Redhead C. Edelman A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Al-Awqati Q. Science. 1989; 244: 1469-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 13Landry D. Sullivan S. Nicolaides M. Redhead C. Edelman A. Field M. Al-Awqati Q. Edwards J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14948-14955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the high homology among these proteins, the protein encoded by the S9 clone was termed CLIC3 for chloride intracellular channel 3. The multiple alignment of CLIC3 with NCC27/CLIC1 and CLIC2 is shown in Fig. 1 B. A strongly hydrophobic region in CLIC3, from amino acids 137–155 (Fig. 1 A), was found by Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity analysis (32Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17279) Google Scholar). This region represents a potential transmembrane domain that is very conserved among the CLIC genes. Searching for other possible motifs in CLIC3 revealed two potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites at Thr-13 and Thr-141, two potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites at Thr-17 and Ser-130, and one potential N-myristoylation site at Gly-7. We generated a full-length clone of CLIC3 by PCR extension of the S9 sequence and then determined whether the protein could be expressed in mammalian cells. The full-length CLIC3 cDNA was tagged with a sequence encoding the FLAG epitope at the 5′ end, and then transiently transfected into COS cells. The transfected cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody. A protein of 24 kDa, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of CLIC3, was recognized specifically by the anti-FLAG antibody in the cells transfected with CLIC3, but not in the cells transfected with the control vector (Fig.2). To determine whether ERK7 and CLIC3 associate in vivo, COS cells were transiently co-transfected with HA-tagged ERK7 and either FLAG-tagged CLIC3 or the control vector. After immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with anti-HA antibody, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed for expression of both the HA-ERK7 and FLAG-CLIC3 proteins by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody and anti-FLAG antibody, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the FLAG-CLIC3 protein co-precipitated with ERK7, indicating that these two proteins do associate in vivo. Surprisingly, when FLAG-CLIC3 was immunoprecipitated first from cells transfected with both CLIC3 and ERK7, no ERK7 was detected in the immunoprecipitates (data not shown). This result may be due to steric hindrance by the anti-FLAG antibody bound to protein A beads preventing interaction with ERK7. A Northern blot fromCLONTECH containing purified poly(A)+RNA from different human tissues was used to analyze the mRNA expression of CLIC3. As shown in Fig. 3, CLIC3 is expressed as a single transcript of approximately 1.15 kilobase in several human tissues, indicating that CLCI3 is widely expressed. However, the level of CLIC3 expression varied, depending upon the particular tissue type. CLIC3 has a very high expression level in placenta and is abundantly expressed in lung and heart, suggesting that it may play an important role in these tissues. CLIC3 is also expressed at a much lower level in skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas, and could not be detected in brain. If CLIC3 associates with ERK7 in vivo, it should co-localize with ERK7 in the cell. Since the intracellular location of ERK7 is predominantly in the cell nucleus (23Abe M.K. Kuo W.-L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar), we determined whether CLIC3 is also localized in the nucleus. CV-1 cells were transfected with FLAG-CLIC3 as well as CMV-β–galactosidase to monitor transfected cells. After fixation, the cells were immunostained with anti-FLAG and anti-β-galactosidase antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 4, the nuclei in the CLIC3-transfected cells were intensely stained with the anti-FLAG antibody, but weak staining was also observed in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the staining by the anti-β-galactosidase antibody was more evenly distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the FLAG-CLIC3 is located predominantly in the nucleus. Cells were also co-transfected with plasmids for both FLAG-CLIC3 and HA-ERK7 to compare the localization of both proteins directly. As shown in Fig. 4 B, HA-ERK7 and CLIC3 co-localized principally in the nucleus. However, there is significantly more cytoplasmic expression of CLIC3 than ERK7, suggesting that CLIC3 may also function independently of ERK7. The nuclear localization of CLIC3 was confirmed using LTK cells (data not shown). To determine whether CLIC3 could potentially be a direct substrate of ERK7, we performed anin vitro kinase assay using a GST-CLIC3 fusion protein as a substrate. A kinase-inactive mutant of ERK7, ERK7-K43R, was used as a negative control (23Abe M.K. Kuo W.-L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Cell lysates extracted from COS cells transfected with either HA-ERK7 or HA-ERK7-K43R were immunoprecipitated and then incubated with either GST-CLIC3 or GST-Fos in kinase assay buffer. In contrast to GST-Fos, no significant phosphorylation of CLIC3 by ERK7 was observed (Fig. 5). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that a phosphorylation site on CLIC3 was unavailable due to the addition of the GST, these results suggest that CLIC3 associates with, but is not a direct substrate of, ERK7. When FLAG-CLIC3 is overexpressed in LTK cells, some of the protein is expressed in the plasma membrane as well as the cytoplasm. A similar protein distribution was observed upon overexpression of NCC27/CLIC1 (15Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Therefore, we measured the current-voltage properties of CLIC3 expressed in the plasma membrane of LTK cells, which have a very low background of chloride channel activity. We first measured the current-voltage properties of untransfected LTK cells or cells transfected with GFP alone using the voltage clamp technique in the whole cell configuration. As illustrated in Fig.6 A, the current-voltage relation measured in the normal extra cellular saline solution was nearly linear between −100 and +80 mV with a slope of 5 GΩ (Fig.6 A, traces 1 and 3). A similar relation was observed when cells were superfused with a saline solution containing a low Cl− concentration (trace 2). In contrast, cells co-transfected with GFP and CLIC3 had two different behaviors. A minority of the cells behaved exactly like cells transfected with GFP alone; these cells had an input resistance of 4.3 ± 4.8 GΩ (range: 0.630–13.6 GΩ;n = 7) and a linear current-voltage relation, which was not changed by superfusing with a saline solution containing a low Cl− concentration. These cells probably express GFP but not CLIC3 at the plasma membrane. A majority of the cells exhibited an altered behavior; the input resistance of 646 ± 242 MΩ (range: 140–1169 MΩ; n = 8) was lower, and exposure to a saline solution containing a low Cl− concentration altered the current-voltage relation (Fig. 6 B). Reducing the extracellular Cl− concentration from 152.5 mmto 22.5 mm reduced the outward current observed at positive potentials. These results indicate that CLIC3 mediates chloride ion transport across the membrane. In an effort to identify proteins that associate with the COOH-terminal tail of ERK7, we isolated the intracellular chloride channel 3 (CLIC3) cDNA by a yeast two-hybrid screen. The interaction between CLIC3 and ERK7 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation studies in COS cells. CLIC3 is a novel protein that is highly related to human CLIC1 (NCC27/CLIC1), CLIC2, and bovine kidney chloride channel p64. A strongly hydrophobic region representing a transmembrane domain is very conserved among NCC27/CLIC1, CLIC2, p64, and CLIC3. Like NCC27/CLICl, CLIC3 localized predominantly in the nucleus and induced chloride conductance when expressed in cells. Overall, these results implicate CLIC3 as a new member of the human CLIC family. To date, only one of the CLIC family members has been shown to have nuclear chloride ion transport activity. NCC27/CLIC1 can promote chloride transport across both the nuclear and plasma membranes (15Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). By analogy based upon sequence homology, cellular localization, and plasma membrane channel activity, it is likely that CLIC3 also has nuclear as well as plasma membrane ion transport activity. Since it is very difficult to detect nuclear ion channel activity, we focused on demonstrating the function of CLIC3 as an inducer of ion transport by probing the plasma membrane in transfected cells. Furthermore, the electrophysiological properties of NCC27/CLIC1 in the nuclearversus the plasma membranes were similar. The role of nuclear ion transport is not clear at the present time, but the existence of three discrete family members suggests that the role is an important one. Based on the current-voltage relationship of the LTK cells transfected with CLIC3, we conclude that CLIC3 stimulates a chloride/anion ion conductance. For example, reducing the extracellular chloride concentration from 152.5 mm to 22.5 mm reduced the outward current observed at positive potentials. The change is easily explained if cells expressing the CLIC3 protein, unlike cells transfected with GFP only, have a relatively large membrane conductance to Cl−. When Cl− is removed from the extracellular saline solution, fewer anions are available to enter resulting in a reduction of outward current. Since intracellular Cl− ions are still present and able to permeate, the current-voltage relation observed at negative potentials is unchanged. Each curve crosses the voltage axes at a different point. In this case the shift in crossing point is +20 mV. Because this is less than the 48 mV predicted by the Nernst equation for a perfect Cl- channel, the membrane must also be permeable to other ions. For example, gluconate used to replace Cl− may be able to carry current with reduced efficiency. The Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation predicts a gluconate:Cl− permeability ratio of 0.173. Based on this ratio, the pore formed by CLIC3 appears to be relatively large. The CLIC family members are much smaller in length than the characterized chloride ion channels and lack the characteristic transmembrane chloride channel (10Heiss N.S. Poustka A. Genomics. 1997; 45: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, CLIC3, which has a limited hydrophobic domain, must either multimerize or associate with other subunits if it indeed is part of a membrane channel. Despite the electrophysiological experimental results supporting the hypothesis that CLIC3 is a component of a Cl− channel, it is also possible that CLIC3 may act as a regulator of a channel. One example of such a protein is pICln, which was cloned and initially identified as a swelling-induced chloride channel (33Paulmichl M. Li Y. Wickman K. Ackerman M. Peralta E. Clapham D. Nature. 1992; 356: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Krapivinsky and co-workers (34Krapivinsky G.B. Ackerman M.J. Gordon E.A. Krapivinsky L.D. Clapham D.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) showed that anti-pICln monoclonal antibodies can block the native swelling-induced chloride channel in Xenopusoocytes, and that pICln was abundant in the cytoplasm and bound to actin. pICln was also shown to bind to a human homolog of yeast SKb1 protein (IBP72), which is associated with Shk1 kinase (35Krapivinsky G. Pu W. Wickman K. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10811-10814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that pICln may play an indirect role in Cl− channel conductance, possibly via interactions with the cytoskeletal network. CLIC3, which is also associated with a kinase, may function in a similar manner. Although CLIC3 is principally localized in the nucleus, no nuclear localization sequence was found. A conserved KKYR has been proposed as a nuclear localization signal motif in the 3′ ends of NCC27/CLIC1, CLIC2, and p64 (15Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), but this motif is not present in CLIC3. Therefore, it is possible that CLIC3 is transported into the nucleus via association with other proteins that are translocated to the nucleus. The observation that CLIC3 is not completely nuclear is consistent with the possibility. Since CLIC3 co-localizes with ERK7 in the nucleus, one potential role of ERK7 could be to bind CLIC3 and transport it to the nucleus. ERK7, the MAP kinase family member that associates with CLIC3, is the newest member of the MAP kinase family. Among the extracellular signal-regulated or ERK family of MAP kinases, only four out of the seven enzymes designated ERKs have the signature TEY activation motif. These are ERKs 1, 2, 5, and 7. ERKs 1 and 2, the enzymes that were originally designated as MAP kinases, are a discrete size between 42 and 44 kDa. In contrast, ERKs 5 and 7 are larger due to the presence of a carboxyl-terminal tail that modulates the properties of the enzyme. Although ERK7 has the signature TEY activation motif of ERK1 and ERK2, this enzyme appears to be significantly different from other ERK family members (23Abe M.K. Kuo W.-L. Hershenson M.B. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). In contrast to previously reported ERKs, ERK7 has significant constitutive activity in serum-starved cells, is targeted to the nucleus in both active and inactive states, and can function as a negative regulator of growth independent of its kinase activity. In all cases, these properties are dependent upon the presence of the COOH-terminal tail. Thus, the interaction of ERK7 with CLIC3 may be very important in the action of the enzyme. The functional consequences of the interaction between CLIC3 and ERK7 are not yet clear. One possibility is that ERK7 mediates phosphorylation of CLIC3 and/or chloride ion channel conductance. While our results suggest CLIC3 is not directly phosphorylated by ERK7, it is possible that the MAP kinase may facilitate association of CLIC3 with other key components or enzymes. Since ERK7 can inhibit DNA synthesis, it is also possible that CLIC3 is linked to a growth regulatory system, either by competing with growth regulatory proteins for binding to ERK7 or by facilitating chloride ion transport, leading to changes in intracellular pH and osmolarity.

https://openalex.org/W1968889490,"Vibrio cholerae cytolysin permeabilizes animal cell membranes. Upon binding to the target lipid bilayer, the protein assembles into homo-oligomeric pores of an as yet unknown stoichiometry. Pore formation has been observed with model liposomes consisting of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, but the latter were much less susceptible to the cytolysin than were erythrocytes or intestinal epithelial cells. We here show that liposome permeabilization is strongly promoted if cholesterol is combined with sphingolipids, whereby the most pronounced effects are observed with monohexosylceramides and free ceramide. These two lipid species are prevalent in mammalian intestinal brush border membranes. We therefore propose that, on its natural target membranes, the cytolysin has a dual specificity for both cholesterol and ceramides. To assess the stoichiometry of the pore, we generated hybrid oligomers of two naturally occurring variants of the toxin that differ in molecular weight. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the mixed oligomers formed a pattern of six distinct bands. Ordered by decreasing electrophoretic mobility, the six oligomer species must comprise 0 to 5 subunits of the larger form; the pore thus is a pentamer. Due to both lipid specificity and pore stoichiometry, V. choleraecytolysin represents a novel prototype in the class of bacterial pore-forming toxins.

Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor is the causative agent of the current seventh cholera pandemic. The severe purging of cholera is due to the effects of cholera enterotoxin upon the small intestine epithelial cells (1Finkelstein R.A. Dorner F. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 27: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Apart from enterotoxin, many strains of V. cholerae El Tor secrete a hemolytic toxin, V. choleraecytolysin (VCC). 1The abbreviations used are: VCC, V. cholerae cytolysin; GalCer, galactosylceramide; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SPM, sphingomyelin; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles. 1The abbreviations used are: VCC, V. cholerae cytolysin; GalCer, galactosylceramide; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SPM, sphingomyelin; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles. The latter is also produced by most V. cholerae non-O1 strains, which may cause intestinal and extraintestinal infections (2Yamamoto K. Ichinose Y. Nakasone N. Tanabe M. Nagahama M. Sakurai J. Iwanaga M. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 927-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro, V. cholerae cytolysin acts upon a variety of target cells, among these are enterocytes and immune cells (3Hall R.H. Drasar B.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3375-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol.

A pathogenetic role for VCC in enteritis is suggested by the observation that the purified protein elicits fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops (6Ichinose Y. Yamamoto K. Nakasone N. Tanabe M.J. Takeda T. Miwatani T. Iwanaga M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zitzer A. Nakisbekov N.O. Li A.V. Semiotrochev V.L. Kiseliov Y.L. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Krasilnikov O.V. Ezepchuk Y.V. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. Virol. Parasitol. Infect. Dis. 1993; 279: 494-504Google Scholar). Homologous cytolysins are secreted by various Aeromonas and Vibrio species that may elicit diarrheal infections and by Vibrio vulnificus, a related organism that causes wound and septicemic infections (8Yamamoto K. Wright A.C. Kaper J.B. Morris J.G. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2706-2709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).During secretion of VCC, a signal peptide of 25 amino acids is cleaved (9Rader A.E. Murphy J.R. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Alm R.A. Stroeher U.H. Manning P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The extracellular procytolysin (79 kDa) requires further proteolytic activation (3Hall R.H. Drasar B.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3375-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yamamoto K. Ichinose Y. Shinagawa H. Makino K. Nakata A. Iwanaga M. Honda T. Miwatani T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4106-4116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can be accomplished by a variety of proteases (12Nagamune K. Yamamoto K. Naka A. Matsuyama J. Miwatani T. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4655-4658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and occurs by removal of an N-terminal fragment of 14 kDa; the latter is important for proper folding of the molecule (13Nagamune K. Yamamoto K. Honda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mature VCC of 65 kDa may undergo an additional proteolytic cleavage close to the C terminus to yield a second active species of about 50 kDa (4Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Recently, V. cholerae cytolysin has been identified as an oligomerizing, pore-forming protein (4Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The process of pore formation involves two separate steps. The water-soluble monomer first binds reversibly to the target membrane (15Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an unknown number of membrane-associated monomers assemble into an oligomer that inserts into the membrane to surround a water-filled pore of 1.5 nm diameter (4Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Krasilnikov O.V. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Zitzer A.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Binding is essentially unsaturable and of low specificity, since the cytolysin readily associates with phosphatidylcholine liposomes (15Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in this synthetic system, membrane permeabilization has only been observed when phosphatidylcholine (PC) was supplemented with cholesterol (14Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even then, the liposomes thus obtained lag far behind animal cell membranes in sensitivity; while rabbit erythrocytes and human enterocytes are lysed at cytolysin concentrations of 170 pm (5Zitzer A. Wassenaar T.M. Walev I. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a 1000 times higher amount had to be employed for permeabilization of PC/cholesterol liposomes (14Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since V. cholerae cytolysin does not detectably interact with rabbit erythrocyte membrane proteins (15Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the superior susceptibility of natural membranes should be accounted for by lipid constituents other than cholesterol. Characterization of these incremental lipid species should both contribute to understanding the molecular properties of the cytolysin and allow for improved liposome models useful in further studies on this interesting toxin.As an initial confirmation of our hypothesis, we found that the susceptibility of liposomes was strongly enhanced when PC was replaced by a crude lipid extract of bovine brain. When the constituents of this lipid mixture were tested singly, liposome sensitization was apparent with sphingolipids, particularly galactosylceramide, whereas only minor effects were observed with glycerophospholipids. Comparison of various sphingolipids indicates that the element essential for interaction with the cytolysin consists in the common ceramide moiety.In the second part of this study, the brain lipid liposome model was utilized to examine the stoichiometry of the cytolysin oligomer. To this end, we employed two naturally occurring forms of the cytolysin that differ in molecular weight but are equally endowed with the capability to form oligomeric pores. When these two forms were simultaneously applied to liposomes, a mixture of oligomers was formed that could be resolved into six distinct species by SDS-PAGE; from this pattern, a pentameric stoichiometry of the oligomeric pore can be inferred. The results of this study are relevant to both molecular and pathogenetic aspects of V. cholerae cytolysin.DISCUSSIONThe cytolysin of V. cholerae belongs to a homologous family of toxins that are widespread among Vibrio andAeromonas species (21Hirono I. Aoki T. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 15: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several of these are capable of eliciting diarrheal disease, including enterotoxin-negative strains ofV. cholerae O1 El Tor (22Morris Jr., J.G. Picardi J.L. Lieb S. Lee J.V. Roberts A. Hood M. Gunn R.A. Blake P.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 19: 296-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Honda S. Shimoirisa K. Adachi A. Saito K. Asano N. Taniguchi T. Honda T. Miwatani T. Lancet. 1988; 2: 1486Abstract PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and non-O1 serotypes (24Hughes J.M. Hollis D.G. Gangarosa E.J. Weaver R.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,25McIntyre O.R. Feeley J.C. Bull. W. H. O. 1965; 32: 627-632PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter instance, VCC most probably is pathogenetically significant, since experimentally the purified protein imparts marked damage to the small intestine epithelia of rabbits and mice (6Ichinose Y. Yamamoto K. Nakasone N. Tanabe M.J. Takeda T. Miwatani T. Iwanaga M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zitzer A. Nakisbekov N.O. Li A.V. Semiotrochev V.L. Kiseliov Y.L. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Krasilnikov O.V. Ezepchuk Y.V. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. Virol. Parasitol. Infect. Dis. 1993; 279: 494-504Google Scholar,26McCardell B.A. Madden J.M. Shah D.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The susceptibility of the epithelial cells to these cytolysins probably reflects the adaptation of V. cholerae and related species to the intestinal environment, but it has not yet been explained in molecular terms. The mammalian intestinal brush border membrane is distinguished by its high content of glycolipids, which may contribute to the tubular shape of the microvilli (27Curatolo W. Neuringer L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17177-17182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Archibald D.D. Yager P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9045-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and, like phospholipids and cholesterol, amount to one-third of the total lipids. Monohexosylceramides or ceramide represent the major glycolipids in rats (29Brasitus T.A. Schachter D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2763-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30Bouhours J.F. Glickman R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and humans (31Bjork S. Breimer M.E. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This composition of lipids very much resembles the most susceptible synthetic liposomes characterized in the present study. We therefore propose that its high content of glycolipids, in conjunction with cholesterol, accounts for the sensitivity of the brush border membrane toward V. choleraecytolysin.One of the most striking findings about the effect of lipids upon the oligomerization of VCC consists in the pronounced cooperativity between sphingolipids and cholesterol. Various sphingolipids have been reported to associate with cholesterol in mixed membranes, which raises the possibility that the oligomerization of VCC is mediated by sphingolipid-cholesterol complexes rather than by the individual lipid molecules. The interaction with cholesterol has been most thoroughly studied with sphingomyelin. Model monolayers of sphingomyelin were significantly condensed upon addition of cholesterol, and the sterol was also more firmly retained by these monolayers than by ones consisting of PC, respectively (32Gronberg L. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3173-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Ohvo H. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for dihexosylceramides, whereas monohexosylceramides did not appreciably associate with cholesterol (34Slotte J.P. Ostman A.L. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7886-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, evidence of stable complexes consisting of cholesterol and free ceramide is lacking as well. Since monohexosylceramides and free ceramide are clearly superior to SPM with respect to the enhancement of VCC oligomerization, it appears that association of sphingolipids and cholesterol is not essential for their interaction with the cytolysin.Another interesting example of a protein simultaneously requiring ceramides and cholesterol in its target lipid membrane is provided by the E1 envelope protein of Semliki Forest virus (35Nieva J.L. Bron R. Corver J. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 36Moesby L. Corver J. Erukulla R.K. Bittman R. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10319-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which triggers fusion of the viral envelope to the endosome membrane. Fusion, like pore formation, requires physical separation of laterally interacting lipid molecules, which might constitute the common rationale behind the unusual combined specificity for two lipid molecules, both of which are largely buried within the apolar core of the bilayer. In line with this interpretation, both ceramide and cholesterol are not required in binding of the cytolysin monomer but essentially contribute in the subsequent event of oligomerization and pore formation.Apart from the apolar moieties of the membrane lipids, their polar head groups also appear to play a role in the oligomerization of VCC. Of note, a choline head group is present in both PC and sphingomyelin, and the efficiency of oligomerization in the presence of either molecule was clearly inferior to that observed with homologous lipid species (PE and ceramide, respectively). The inhibitory effect of the choline head group apparent from these results may be shared by the complex polar tetrasaccharide moiety of the ganglioside GM1. In this context, it should be noted that a reduction in sensitivity of rabbit erythrocytes to VCC has been obtained by neuraminidase treatment (37Saha N. Banerjee K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Removal of sialic acid from the membrane glycolipids exposed terminal galactose moieties, and susceptibility of the cells could be restored by treating the cells with galactose oxidase. It thus appears that VCC may interact with terminal galactosyl residues (which also occur in the ganglioside GM1) in a non-functional manner. On the other hand, galactosylceramide was very similar in its capability to sensitize membranes to VCC as were glucosylceramide and free ceramide. Possibly, the distance separating galactose from the ceramide moiety determines whether or not oligomerization of VCC proceeds following its binding to the sugar residue.Sensitive model liposomes containing both cholesterol and glycosphingolipids were utilized to assess the stoichiometry of theV. cholerae cytolysin pore. The electrophoretic analysis of heteromers applied here to elucidate the oligomer stoichiometry was inspired by previous work on the heptamer of Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin (38Gouaux J.E. Braha O. Hobaugh M. Song L. Cheley S. Shustak C. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12828-12831Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the work cited, the two toxin variants required were obtained by chemical modification of single cysteine mutants. Where chemical modification or limited proteolysis are inappropriate, extending or truncating the termini of a protein molecule at the DNA level might be used to produce the variant species for heteromer analysis. The latter method should thus be more generally useful to determine the stoichiometries of toxin pores and, if combined with non-denaturing analytical separation, other homo-oligomeric proteins.Among the bacterial pore-formers, α-hemolysin provides the only example of an oligomer structure determined at high resolution (39Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Its transmembrane portion consists of a β-barrel with 7-fold rotational symmetry. Heptameric stoichiometry and β-barrel structure has also been confirmed with the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin (40Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 41Benson E.L. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3941-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As a pentamer, VCC so far is unique within this particular class of toxins, but there are several previous examples of pentameric transmembrane channels in general. One of those is provided by the B subunit oligomer of V. cholerae enteroxin. The hollow center of the latter is lined by five α-helices (42Zhang R.G. Westbrook M.L. Westbrook E.M. Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Maulik P.R. Reed R.A. Shipley G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Helical structure has also been suggested for the intramembranous portion of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (43Cooper E. Couturier S. Ballivet M. Nature. 1991; 350: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and for the cardiac calcium channel phospholamban (44Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It would be most interesting to determine which one of the two above structural paradigms applies to the transmembrane part of the VCC pore.In sum, the present study shows that V. cholerae cytolysin has a dual specificity for both cholesterol and ceramides, which reflects the composition of its natural target membranes and that the pore is a pentamer. Both these properties qualify VCC as a novel prototype within the class of bacterial pore-forming toxins, and they probably apply to a series of homologous toxins of other Vibrionaceae as well. Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor is the causative agent of the current seventh cholera pandemic. The severe purging of cholera is due to the effects of cholera enterotoxin upon the small intestine epithelial cells (1Finkelstein R.A. Dorner F. Pharmacol. Ther. 1985; 27: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Apart from enterotoxin, many strains of V. cholerae El Tor secrete a hemolytic toxin, V. choleraecytolysin (VCC). 1The abbreviations used are: VCC, V. cholerae cytolysin; GalCer, galactosylceramide; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SPM, sphingomyelin; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles. 1The abbreviations used are: VCC, V. cholerae cytolysin; GalCer, galactosylceramide; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; SPM, sphingomyelin; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles. The latter is also produced by most V. cholerae non-O1 strains, which may cause intestinal and extraintestinal infections (2Yamamoto K. Ichinose Y. Nakasone N. Tanabe M. Nagahama M. Sakurai J. Iwanaga M. Infect. Immun. 1986; 51: 927-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, V. cholerae cytolysin acts upon a variety of target cells, among these are enterocytes and immune cells (3Hall R.H. Drasar B.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3375-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Zitzer A.

A pathogenetic role for VCC in enteritis is suggested by the observation that the purified protein elicits fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops (6Ichinose Y. Yamamoto K. Nakasone N. Tanabe M.J. Takeda T. Miwatani T. Iwanaga M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zitzer A. Nakisbekov N.O. Li A.V. Semiotrochev V.L. Kiseliov Y.L. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Krasilnikov O.V. Ezepchuk Y.V. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. Virol. Parasitol. Infect. Dis. 1993; 279: 494-504Google Scholar). Homologous cytolysins are secreted by various Aeromonas and Vibrio species that may elicit diarrheal infections and by Vibrio vulnificus, a related organism that causes wound and septicemic infections (8Yamamoto K. Wright A.C. Kaper J.B. Morris J.G. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 2706-2709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During secretion of VCC, a signal peptide of 25 amino acids is cleaved (9Rader A.E. Murphy J.R. Infect. Immun. 1988; 56: 1414-1419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Alm R.A. Stroeher U.H. Manning P.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1988; 2: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The extracellular procytolysin (79 kDa) requires further proteolytic activation (3Hall R.H. Drasar B.S. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3375-3379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yamamoto K. Ichinose Y. Shinagawa H. Makino K. Nakata A. Iwanaga M. Honda T. Miwatani T. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 4106-4116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can be accomplished by a variety of proteases (12Nagamune K. Yamamoto K. Naka A. Matsuyama J. Miwatani T. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4655-4658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and occurs by removal of an N-terminal fragment of 14 kDa; the latter is important for proper folding of the molecule (13Nagamune K. Yamamoto K. Honda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mature VCC of 65 kDa may undergo an additional proteolytic cleavage close to the C terminus to yield a second active species of about 50 kDa (4Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Recently, V. cholerae cytolysin has been identified as an oligomerizing, pore-forming protein (4Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The process of pore formation involves two separate steps. The water-soluble monomer first binds reversibly to the target membrane (15Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an unknown number of membrane-associated monomers assemble into an oligomer that inserts into the membrane to surround a water-filled pore of 1.5 nm diameter (4Zitzer A. Walev I. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 184: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Krasilnikov O.V. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Zitzer A.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1111: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Binding is essentially unsaturable and of low specificity, since the cytolysin readily associates with phosphatidylcholine liposomes (15Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, in this synthetic system, membrane permeabilization has only been observed when phosphatidylcholine (PC) was supplemented with cholesterol (14Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even then, the liposomes thus obtained lag far behind animal cell membranes in sensitivity; while rabbit erythrocytes and human enterocytes are lysed at cytolysin concentrations of 170 pm (5Zitzer A. Wassenaar T.M. Walev I. Bhakdi S. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 1293-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), a 1000 times higher amount had to be employed for permeabilization of PC/cholesterol liposomes (14Ikigai H. Akatsuka A. Tsujiyama H. Nakae T. Shimamura T. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2968-2973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since V. cholerae cytolysin does not detectably interact with rabbit erythrocyte membrane proteins (15Zitzer A. Palmer M. Weller U. Wassenaar T. Biermann C. Tranum Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the superior susceptibility of natural membranes should be accounted for by lipid constituents other than cholesterol. Characterization of these incremental lipid species should both contribute to understanding the molecular properties of the cytolysin and allow for improved liposome models useful in further studies on this interesting toxin. As an initial confirmation of our hypothesis, we found that the susceptibility of liposomes was strongly enhanced when PC was replaced by a crude lipid extract of bovine brain. When the constituents of this lipid mixture were tested singly, liposome sensitization was apparent with sphingolipids, particularly galactosylceramide, whereas only minor effects were observed with glycerophospholipids. Comparison of various sphingolipids indicates that the element essential for interaction with the cytolysin consists in the common ceramide moiety. In the second part of this study, the brain lipid liposome model was utilized to examine the stoichiometry of the cytolysin oligomer. To this end, we employed two naturally occurring forms of the cytolysin that differ in molecular weight but are equally endowed with the capability to form oligomeric pores. When these two forms were simultaneously applied to liposomes, a mixture of oligomers was formed that could be resolved into six distinct species by SDS-PAGE; from this pattern, a pentameric stoichiometry of the oligomeric pore can be inferred. The results of this study are relevant to both molecular and pathogenetic aspects of V. cholerae cytolysin. DISCUSSIONThe cytolysin of V. cholerae belongs to a homologous family of toxins that are widespread among Vibrio andAeromonas species (21Hirono I. Aoki T. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 15: 269-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Several of these are capable of eliciting diarrheal disease, including enterotoxin-negative strains ofV. cholerae O1 El Tor (22Morris Jr., J.G. Picardi J.L. Lieb S. Lee J.V. Roberts A. Hood M. Gunn R.A. Blake P.A. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1984; 19: 296-297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Honda S. Shimoirisa K. Adachi A. Saito K. Asano N. Taniguchi T. Honda T. Miwatani T. Lancet. 1988; 2: 1486Abstract PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and non-O1 serotypes (24Hughes J.M. Hollis D.G. Gangarosa E.J. Weaver R.E. Ann. Intern. Med. 1978; 88: 602-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,25McIntyre O.R. Feeley J.C. Bull. W. H. O. 1965; 32: 627-632PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter instance, VCC most probably is pathogenetically significant, since experimentally the purified protein imparts marked damage to the small intestine epithelia of rabbits and mice (6Ichinose Y. Yamamoto K. Nakasone N. Tanabe M.J. Takeda T. Miwatani T. Iwanaga M. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1090-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zitzer A. Nakisbekov N.O. Li A.V. Semiotrochev V.L. Kiseliov Y.L. Muratkhodjaev J.N. Krasilnikov O.V. Ezepchuk Y.V. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. Virol. Parasitol. Infect. Dis. 1993; 279: 494-504Google Scholar,26McCardell B.A. Madden J.M. Shah D.B. Can. J. Microbiol. 1985; 31: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).The susceptibility of the epithelial cells to these cytolysins probably reflects the adaptation of V. cholerae and related species to the intestinal environment, but it has not yet been explained in molecular terms. The mammalian intestinal brush border membrane is distinguished by its high content of glycolipids, which may contribute to the tubular shape of the microvilli (27Curatolo W. Neuringer L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17177-17182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Archibald D.D. Yager P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9045-9055Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and, like phospholipids and cholesterol, amount to one-third of the total lipids. Monohexosylceramides or ceramide represent the major glycolipids in rats (29Brasitus T.A. Schachter D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2763-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 30Bouhours J.F. Glickman R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 441: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and humans (31Bjork S. Breimer M.E. Hansson G.C. Karlsson K.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6758-6765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This composition of lipids very much resembles the most susceptible synthetic liposomes characterized in the present study. We therefore propose that its high content of glycolipids, in conjunction with cholesterol, accounts for the sensitivity of the brush border membrane toward V. choleraecytolysin.One of the most striking findings about the effect of lipids upon the oligomerization of VCC consists in the pronounced cooperativity between sphingolipids and cholesterol. Various sphingolipids have been reported to associate with cholesterol in mixed membranes, which raises the possibility that the oligomerization of VCC is mediated by sphingolipid-cholesterol complexes rather than by the individual lipid molecules. The interaction with cholesterol has been most thoroughly studied with sphingomyelin. Model monolayers of sphingomyelin were significantly condensed upon addition of cholesterol, and the sterol was also more firmly retained by these monolayers than by ones consisting of PC, respectively (32Gronberg L. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3173-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Ohvo H. Slotte J.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8018-8024Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Similar findings have been reported for dihexosylceramides, whereas monohexosylceramides did not appreciably associate with cholesterol (34Slotte J.P. Ostman A.L. Kumar E.R. Bittman R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7886-7892Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, evidence of stable complexes consisting of cholesterol and free ceramide is lacking as well. Since monohexosylceramides and free ceramide are clearly superior to SPM with respect to the enhancement of VCC oligomerization, it appears that association of sphingolipids and cholesterol is not essential for their interaction with the cytolysin.Another interesting example of a protein simultaneously requiring ceramides and cholesterol in its target lipid membrane is provided by the E1 envelope protein of Semliki Forest virus (35Nieva J.L. Bron R. Corver J. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 36Moesby L. Corver J. Erukulla R.K. Bittman R. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10319-10324Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which triggers fusion of the viral envelope to the endosome membrane. Fusion, like pore formation, requires physical separation of laterally interacting lipid molecules, which might constitute the common rationale behind the unusual combined specificity for two lipid molecules, both of which are largely buried within the apolar core of the bilayer. In line with this interpretation, both ceramide and cholesterol are not required in binding of the cytolysin monomer but essentially contribute in the subsequent event of oligomerization and pore formation.Apart from the apolar moieties of the membrane lipids, their polar head groups also appear to play a role in the oligomerization of VCC. Of note, a choline head group is present in both PC and sphingomyelin, and the efficiency of oligomerization in the presence of either molecule was clearly inferior to that observed with homologous lipid species (PE and ceramide, respectively). The inhibitory effect of the choline head group apparent from these results may be shared by the complex polar tetrasaccharide moiety of the ganglioside GM1. In this context, it should be noted that a reduction in sensitivity of rabbit erythrocytes to VCC has been obtained by neuraminidase treatment (37Saha N. Banerjee K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 162-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Removal of sialic acid from the membrane glycolipids exposed terminal galactose moieties, and susceptibility of the cells could be restored by treating the cells with galactose oxidase. It thus appears that VCC may interact with terminal galactosyl residues (which also occur in the ganglioside GM1) in a non-functional manner. On the other hand, galactosylceramide was very similar in its capability to sensitize membranes to VCC as were glucosylceramide and free ceramide. Possibly, the distance separating galactose from the ceramide moiety determines whether or not oligomerization of VCC proceeds following its binding to the sugar residue.Sensitive model liposomes containing both cholesterol and glycosphingolipids were utilized to assess the stoichiometry of theV. cholerae cytolysin pore. The electrophoretic analysis of heteromers applied here to elucidate the oligomer stoichiometry was inspired by previous work on the heptamer of Staphylococcus aureus α-hemolysin (38Gouaux J.E. Braha O. Hobaugh M. Song L. Cheley S. Shustak C. Bayley H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12828-12831Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In the work cited, the two toxin variants required were obtained by chemical modification of single cysteine mutants. Where chemical modification or limited proteolysis are inappropriate, extending or truncating the termini of a protein molecule at the DNA level might be used to produce the variant species for heteromer analysis. The latter method should thus be more generally useful to determine the stoichiometries of toxin pores and, if combined with non-denaturing analytical separation, other homo-oligomeric proteins.Among the bacterial pore-formers, α-hemolysin provides the only example of an oligomer structure determined at high resolution (39Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar). Its transmembrane portion consists of a β-barrel with 7-fold rotational symmetry. Heptameric stoichiometry and β-barrel structure has also been confirmed with the protective antigen component of anthrax toxin (40Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 41Benson E.L. Huynh P.D. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3941-3948Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As a pentamer, VCC so far is unique within this particular class of toxins, but there are several previous examples of pentameric transmembrane channels in general. One of those is provided by the B subunit oligomer of V. cholerae enteroxin. The hollow center of the latter is lined by five α-helices (42Zhang R.G. Westbrook M.L. Westbrook E.M. Scott D.L. Otwinowski Z. Maulik P.R. Reed R.A. Shipley G.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 550-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Helical structure has also been suggested for the intramembranous portion of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (43Cooper E. Couturier S. Ballivet M. Nature. 1991; 350: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and for the cardiac calcium channel phospholamban (44Arkin I.T. Adams P.D. MacKenzie K.R. Lemmon M.A. Brunger A.T. Engelman D.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4757-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It would be most interesting to determine which one of the two above structural paradigms applies to the transmembrane part of the VCC pore.In sum, the present study shows that V. cholerae cytolysin has a dual specificity for both cholesterol and ceramides, which reflects the composition of its natural target membranes and that the pore is a pentamer.

Chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments were quantitatively extracted fromb6f complex purified from (i) the thermophilic cyanobacterium, Mastigocladus laminosus, (ii) spinach chloroplasts, and (iii) the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Visible and mass spectra showed the carotenoid to be a β-carotene of molecular weight = 536, with a stoichiometry of 1.0:1 relative to cytochrome f in the highly activeM. laminosus complex but somewhat lower stoichiometries, 0.77 and 0.55, in the b6f complex obtained from spinach chloroplasts and C. reinhardtii. A photoprotective function for the β-carotene was inferred from the findings that the rate of photobleaching of the chlorophyll a bound in the complex was found to vary inversely with β-carotene content and to decrease markedly in the presence of ambient N2 instead of air. The presence of β-carotene in the b6fcomplex, and not in the related bc1 complexes of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and photosynthetic bacteria, suggests that an additional function is to protect the protein complexes in oxygenic photosynthetic membranes against toxic effects of intramembrane singlet O2. The cytochrome b6fcomplex of oxygenic photosynthesis carries out “dark reactions” of electron transfer that link the light-driven reactions of the reaction centers, and coupled proton transfer that generates part of the electrochemical potential utilized for ATP synthesis. In contrast to the bc1 complex of the respiratory chain, with which there are many structural and functional homologies, theb6f complex contains bound pigment molecules. Along with the specifically bound chlorophyll a previously found to be bound stoichiometrically in the dimericb6f complex, it was found in the present study that β-carotene is also present in the b6fcomplex at stoichiometric levels or nearly so.

Elucidation of the structural basis of energy transduction in the cytochrome bc complexes is proceeding rapidly. High resolution structure data from x-ray diffraction have been obtained for the 11 subunits of the integral cytochrome bc1complex from the bovine respiratory chain (1Xia D. Yu C.-H. Kim H. Xia J.-Z.

For the cytochromeb6f complex, atomic structures (<2.0-Å resolution) have been obtained for the lumen side domains of cytochromef (4Martinez S.E. Huang D. Szczepaniak A. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L.

Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It is clear that along with many similarities between theb6f and bc1 complexes (7Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrmann R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), there are significant differences in structure, now most obvious in the comparison of the structures of cytochromes f andc1 (Refs. 2Zhang Z. Huang L. Shulmeisster V.M. Chi Y.-I. Kim K.K. Hung L.-W. Crofts A.R. Berry E.A. Kim S.-H. Nature. 1998; 392: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar and 3Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar versus 4). The presence of stoichiometrically bound pigment molecules in the cytochrome b6f complex, discussed in the present work, is another contrasting aspect. The electronic connection between the reducing and oxidizing sides of photosystems II and I, provided by the cytochromeb6f complex, through which the proton electrochemical potential is generated, is traditionally considered part of the “dark” reactions of oxygenic photosynthesis (8Cramer W.A. Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M. Huang D. Zhang H. Martinez S.E. Smith J.L. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1996; 47: 477-508Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, the finding of a molecule of the light-absorbing pigment, chlorophylla, to be present at an approximate 1:1 stoichiometry in active cytochrome b6f complex after exhaustive chromatography, was unexpected (9Huang D. Everly R.M. Cheng R.H. Heymann J.B. Schagger H. Sled V. Ohnishi T. Baker T. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to the unit stoichiometry, a specific binding site for the chlorophyll molecule in the complex was implied by the dichroism of the bound chlorophylla in oriented monomeric b6f complex isolated without the Rieske protein from the cyanobacterium,Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (10Bald D. Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Rögner M. Murata N. Research in Photosynthesis. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Netherlands1992: 629-632Crossref Google Scholar). A specific binding site of a chlorophyll a in the complex from the green alga,Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, was implied by spectroscopic identification of a specific hydrogen-bonding mode of the chlorophyll and slow rates of exchange of the b6f-bound Chl 1The abbreviations used are: Chl, chlorophyll; Car, carotenoid; 1Car* or 3Car*, first excited singlet or triplet state of carotenoid; 3Chl*, first excited triplet state of chlorophyll; cyt, cytochrome; ε, dielectric constant; εmm, millimolar extinction coefficient; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LHC, light-harvesting chlorophyll pigment protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PC, plastocyanin; PS, photosystem; μE, microeinstein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; 1O2, singlet O2. 1The abbreviations used are: Chl, chlorophyll; Car, carotenoid; 1Car* or 3Car*, first excited singlet or triplet state of carotenoid; 3Chl*, first excited triplet state of chlorophyll; cyt, cytochrome; ε, dielectric constant; εmm, millimolar extinction coefficient; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; LHC, light-harvesting chlorophyll pigment protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PC, plastocyanin; PS, photosystem; μE, microeinstein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; 1O2, singlet O2. with3[H]Chl in detergent micelles (11Pierre Y. Breyton C. Lemoine Y. Robert B. Vernotte C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21901-21908Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The conclusion that the chlorophyll a molecule is bound at a specific site in the b6f complex raises the questions of where the two chlorophyll molecules per dimer are located and the functional role of the pigment molecules in the complex. It has been proposed that the function of the chlorophyll a may be to stabilize the dimeric form of the b6f complex (12Breyton C. Tribet C. Olive J. Dubacq J.-P. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21892-21900Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The presence of a chlorophyll molecule also implies that there should be a neighboring carotenoid to quench the chlorophyll triplet state that, otherwise, will inevitably lead to photodamage through formation of singlet oxygen (13Seely G.R. Vernon L.P. Seely G.R. The Chlorophylls. Academic Press, New York1966: 523-568Crossref Google Scholar). It is reported in the present study that β-carotene is present in the cytochromeb6f complex of the cyanobacterium,Mastigocladus laminosus, at a unit stoichiometry relative to cytochrome f, approximately equivalent to that of the bound chlorophyll a. The Chl a in the M. laminosus b6f complex, compared with the complex isolated from C. reinhardtii with half the β-carotene content, is twice as resistant to bleaching by actinic light, which was found to be O2-dependent. The b6f complex was purified from spinach chloroplasts and C. reinhardtii according to the procedures described previously (9Huang D. Everly R.M. Cheng R.H. Heymann J.B. Schagger H. Sled V. Ohnishi T. Baker T. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4401-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and from cyanobacteria as described (14Huang D. Zhang H. Soriano G.M. Dahms T.E.S. Krahn J.M. Smith J.L. Cramer W.A. Garab G. Proc. XI Int. Congr. Photosynth. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1998Google Scholar). The differences in the latter procedure are the use of a propyl-agarose column before the sucrose gradient and of dodecylmaltoside in the sucrose gradient step. Pigments were extracted with 80% acetone, 20% methanol at 4 °C under dim light (15Patzlaff J.S. Barry B.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7802-7811Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), vortexed (1 min), sonicated (2 min), and centrifuged at 5,000 × g(10 min). The supernatant was decanted and filtered through a Millex SLCR L04 NS (Millipore) 0.5-μm filter. A second extraction was carried out with 80% acetone, 20% methanol to ensure complete extraction. Because of the prominence of the spectrum of the bound chlorophyll a, εmm = 79 for the absorbance peak at 669 nm (16Porra R.J. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 31-58Google Scholar), the efficiency of extraction based on the absorbance of first and second extracts could be determined to be > 98%. The second extract was colorless by visual inspection. The pigments were resolved on HPLC following procedures in (17Gilmore A.M Yamamoto H.Y. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 543: 137-145Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar), using a Microsorb-MV C-18 column (Rainin Instruments ODS (4.6 mm, inner diameter × 25 cm)), and eluted isocratically (0—4 min) with acetonitrile/Tris-HCl (0.1m, pH 8.0), 80:3 (v/v), and then by a 4.5-min linear gradient to methanol:hexane, 4:1 (v/v). All solvents were filtered through GH-Polypro 0.2-μm filters (Gelman Sciences). Sample injections were 20 μl, the flow-rate for all separations was 2 ml/min, and the eluent was monitored at 440 nm. Pigments were identified by UV-visible spectrophotometry and mass spectrometry. For visible spectra, chlorophyll a and β-carotene fractions were collected from the HPLC column, dried under an N2stream, the fractions resolubilized in methanol and hexane, respectively, and their absorption spectra recorded on a Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The pigment concentrations were calculated from the visible spectra using the extinction coefficients for chlorophyll a, εmm(A 665–A 750) = 71.4 in methanol (16Porra R.J. Scheer H. Chlorophylls. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 31-58Google Scholar), and for β-carotene, εmm(445 nm) = 134 (18Britton G. Young A.J. Young A. Britton G. Carotenoids in Photosynthesis. Chapman and Hall, London1993: 409-457Crossref Google Scholar). The pigment content was quantitated by measurement of the area under the peaks in reverse-phase HPLC corresponding to addition of known amounts of pigment standards, and the standard samples were diluted into 80–20% acetone-methanol. The two separated components from the HPLC column were collected, dried under a nitrogen stream, redissolved in methanol (Chl a) and hexane (carotenoids), and their concentrations determined from their visible spectra. The two methods agreed within approximately 3%. Mass spectra were obtained at the Nebraska Center for Mass Spectrometry by high resolution fast atom bombardment using Micromass AutoSpec double focusing-liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry. Neat samples were dissolved in 1–2 μl of matrix (3-nitrobenzyl alcohol doped with LiI) on the probe tip. Mass calibration was achieved by using ions of known mass present in a saturated solution of CsI in glycerol. The putative chlorophyll a sample in the 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix produced a mixture of M+ and (M-H)+ ions with a mass/charge ratio = 892 and 893, respectively. The mass of M+, determined with high precision, was 892.5421 Da and that for the putative β-carotene sample was determined to be 536.4371. The cytochrome content was determined from difference spectra of the cytochrome b6f complex, ∼0.1 mg/ml in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 30 mm β-d-octyl glucoside, using a Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer with a measuring beam half-bandwidth of 2.0 nm. Ferricyanide, ascorbate, and dithionite were used as redox agents. A reduced minus oxidized ΔεmM = 26 mm−1 cm−1 (19Metzger S.U. Cramer W.A. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) of cytochromef at 554 nm, relative to the isosbestic wavelengths at 534, 544, and 561 nm, was used to determine cytochrome concentrations. Room temperature fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the chlorophyll a in the M. laminosus cytochromeb6f complex, at a cytochrome fconcentration of 0.3–1 μm in 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-d-octyl glucoside, were measured with an SLM-Aminco 8000 spectrofluorimeter thermostatted at 20 °C. The excitation and emission wavelengths, for measurements of emission and excitation spectra, respectively, were 440 and 676 nm, with bandwidths of 4 and 8 nm, respectively. A stirred 1-ml cyt b6f sample, ∼1 μm cyt f in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.02% β-d-dodecyl maltoside, was illuminated with 1.6 × 106 μE/m2 of white light filtered through a 12.5-cm 1% CuSO4 solution as a heat filter. 0.2 ml of sample were taken at different time intervals and diluted 5-fold into the same buffer. The chlorophyll a visible spectrum was measured with a Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The photobleaching was measured in the presence and relative absence of air, in the latter case by de-aerating the stirred sample on ice for 2 h with N2 gas, adding the b6f complex to the degassed buffer with a syringe, and then flushing the air space above the sample with N2 gas before and during illumination. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on a JASCO J600 spectropolarimeter. Spectral parameters were as follows: sampling, 0.2-nm wavelength increments; time constant, 2 s; spectral half-bandwidth, 2 nm; optical path length, 1 cm; spectra, average of 4 scans after subtraction of the buffer blank. Cytb6f (6 μm) from spinach thylakoid membranes was suspended in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, and 20 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucoside. The cytochrome b6f complex contains the four “large” petA–D gene products, cytochromef, cyt b 6, the Rieske protein, and subunit IV, seen in the first dimension SDS-PAGE (9Huang D. Everly R.M.

The ratio of f to b heme in the complex from spinach chloroplasts (Fig. 1 A)C. reinhardtii or M. laminosus (not shown) was determined from the amplitudes in the cytochrome α-band region of the chemical difference spectra, ascorbate minus ferricyanide for cytf (Fig. 1 A, a) and dithionite minus ascorbate for cytochrome b6 (Fig. 1 A,b), whose ratio was 1:2. The concentration of cytochromef and the complex were determined using the extinction coefficient, εmm = 26 (19Metzger S.U. Cramer W.A. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although it has not been separately determined, we infer from the ratio of amplitudes and from the known structural requirement for twob hemes in bc complexes (1Xia D. Yu C.-H. Kim H. Xia J.-Z.

An essentially identical spectrum was obtained for the complex isolated from M. laminosus (not shown). Extraction of all pigments from the b6f complex was carried out using 80% acetone, 20% methanol at 4 °C under dim light. Total extraction (>98%) was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” The pigments from the chloroplast (Fig.2 A), M. laminosus(Fig. 2 B), and C. reinhardtii (not shown)b6f complex were separated into two major components by reverse phase HPLC in hexane:methanol, 4:1, detected by their absorbance at 440 nm, whose visible and mass spectra are diagnostic of chlorophyll a and β-carotene. The visible absorbance spectra of the two HPLC peaks from the chloroplastb6f complex (Fig.3) are characteristic, respectively, of β-carotene (Fig. 3 A; Ref. 26Koyama Y. Hashimoto H. Young A. Britton G. Carotenoids in Photosynthesis. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 327-408Crossref Google Scholar) and chlorophyll a(Fig. 3 B). Essentially identical spectra were obtained for the HPLC-separated (Fig. 2 B) pigment components of M. laminosus (not shown). Through the features of the major and minor peak positions at 434 and 473 nm, the spectrum for β-carotene (Fig.3 A) most closely resembles a 9-cis or 15-cis β-carotene (26Koyama Y. Hashimoto H. Young A. Britton G. Carotenoids in Photosynthesis. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 327-408Crossref Google Scholar). The mass of the isolated pigments was determined by fast atom bombardment ionization mass spectrometry to be 892.5421 and 536.4371, respectively (cf. “Materials and Methods”), for the two pigment components shown to be separated by reverse phase HPLC in Fig. 2 A. The calculated molecular masses of chlorophyll a(C55H72N4O5Mg) and β-carotene (C40H56) are 892.96 and 536.85, leading to an absolute assignment of chlorophyll a and β-carotene for the two isolated pigments.Figure 3Room temperature absorption spectra of HPLC-purified (A) β-carotene dissolved in 100% hexane and (B) chlorophyll adissolved in 100% methanol, both pigments obtained from spinach cytochromeb 6 fcomplex. The spectrum (A) is characteristic of 9-cis or 15-cis-β-carotene (26Koyama Y. Hashimoto H. Young A. Britton G. Carotenoids in Photosynthesis. Chapman & Hall, London1993: 327-408Crossref Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The concentration of the pigment components separated by HPLC was determined using the areas under the peaks, from addition of known concentrations of pigment standards, and by collecting and drying each of the two components, redissolving them in methanol (Chl) and hexane (β-carotene), and determining their spectra, checked through the extinction coefficients (εmM(A 665–A 750)) of 71.4 mm−1 for chlorophyll a in methanol and 134 mm−1 cm−1 at 445 nm for β-carotene in 100% hexane. Using the differential extinction coefficient, ΔεmM = 26 mm−1 cm−1, for cytochromef, the stoichiometry of the chlorophylla and β-carotene relative to cytochrome f is 0.97 ± 0.13 and 0.77 ± 0.07, respectively, in the chloroplast complex (Table 1, spinach chloroplasts), 1.65 ± 0.3 and 1.02 ± 0.1 in that from M. laminosus (Table 1), and 1.37 ± 0.3 and 0.55 ± 0.08 in C. reinhardtii. Recalculation of the data of Huang et al.(9Huang D. Everly R.M. Cheng R.H. Heymann J.B. Schagger H. Sled V. Ohnishi T. Baker T. Cramer W.A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 21901-21908Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), using the recently redetermined ΔεmM = 26 mm−1cm−1 for cyt f yields values of the Chl a/cyt f ratio of 1–1.2 and 1.1–1.6, respectively. This eliminates any problem of the significance of a stoichiometry smaller than 1:1 (25Pierre Y. Breyton C. Kramer D. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29342-29349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), but raises the possibility of either a second bound chlorophyll a or a small amount of nonspecifically bound chlorophyll. The latter is a crucial issue in studies of the fluorescence properties of the specifically bound chlorophyll a. Recalculation of the β-carotene/cytf stoichiometry previously reported (11Pierre Y. Breyton C. Lemoine Y. Robert B. Vernotte C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21901-21908Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) using the cytf extinction coefficient determined previously (19Metzger S.U. Cramer W.A. Whitmarsh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) yields a value of 0.38–0.55, close to the value found in the present study. Because the fluorescence yield and lifetime of β-carotene are small (27Frank H.A. Christensen R.L. Blankenship R.E. Madigan M.A. Bauer C.E. Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Netherlands1996: 373-384Google Scholar), these two pigments have to be located within a small distance of each other for energy transfer from β-carotene to the chlorophyll a to occur. The excitation spectrum for chlorophyll a fluorescence at 676 nm from the b6f complex shows a broad band of small amplitude centered near 490 nm (Fig. 1 B,inset, spectrum (b)). This band is absent in a solution mixture of chlorophyll a and β-carotene (not shown). Such a band was absent in the excitation spectrum for chlorophyll a fluorescence at low temperature (77 K) for the complex from the green alga C. reinhardtii (11Pierre Y. Breyton C. Lemoine Y. Robert B. Vernotte C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21901-21908Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the latter work, the issue of a carotenoid excitation band was not specifically addressed because the carotenoid content was found to be less than stoichiometric. The existence of three preparations from different sources that have different contents and stoichiometries of β-carotene to cytochrome f creates the possibility of testing the hypothesis that one of the functions of the β-carotene, as in the photosynthetic antenna proteins, is to protect the chlorophyll a from photodamage. Such damage can arise from production of chemically reactive singlet oxygen because of the interaction of ground state triplet oxygen with the excited state (*) chlorophyll triplet (13Seely G.R.

Academic Press, New York1966: 523-568Crossref Google Scholar) shown. 3Chl*+3O2→1Chl+1O2* REACTION1β-carotene (Car) can serve as an alternative acceptor of the excited state chlorophyll triplet, preventing the production of excited singlet oxygen,1 O 2*. 3Chl*+1Car→1Chl+3Car* REACTION2Significant photobleaching of the Chl a in the C. reinhardtii b6f complex could be observed after a 10-min exposure to heat-filtered white light with an intensity of 2.7 × 103 μE/m2 s (Fig.4 A, b, dashed spectrum, compared with the spectrum of unilluminated sample, Fig.4 A, a, solid curve). The residual spectrum in the 400–450 nm region (Fig. 4 A, b,dashed spectrum) arises mostly from the Soret bands of cytochrome f and the two hemes of cytochromeb 6 and explains why the amplitude of the β-carotene near 500 nm appears relatively small compared with that in the Soret region arising from one-two chlorophylls and three hemes from cytochromes b6 and f (Fig.1 B). The time course of the bleaching of the Chl a in C. reinhardtii is shown (Fig. 4 B, curve c). Also shown in Fig. 4 B is the time course of the bleaching of the Chl a in the b6f complex ofM. laminosus (curve a) and spinach chloroplasts (curve b). It can be seen that the bleaching of Chla in the M. laminosus complex is very small. The residual absorbance of the 676 nm Chl a band, after the 10-min illumination (1.7 × 106 μE/m2) was 92 ± 2%, 70 ± 5%, and 46 ± 10% (n = 3), respectively, for the complex from M. laminosus, spinach chloroplasts, and C. reinhardtii(Fig. 4 B). The relative magnitude of this residual absorbance for the Chl a from the b6fcomplex from these three sources was 1.0, 0.76, 0.50, almost proportional to the respective stoichiometries of β-carotene to cytochrome f (Table I). The bleaching of the Chl a band in the C. reinhardtiicomplex was reduced substantially, the residual absorbance increasing from 47 ± 8 to 74 ± 4% (n = 3) when the sample was equilibrated with N2 instead of air before exposure to the actinic light (Fig. 4 B, ▪, linked byarrow, showing the change in photobleaching of theb6f complex from C. reinhardtii).Table IPigment content (mol/mol) of purified cytochrome b6f complex from spinach chloroplasts, M. laminosus, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtiiSource of cyt b 6 fChl a/cytfCar/cyt fChl a/CarSpinach chloroplasts0.97 ± 0.130.77 ± 0.071.26 ± 0.06(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 3)M. laminosus1.65 ± 0.291.02 ± 0.121.63 ± 0.41(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 3)C. reinhardtii1.37 ± 0.310.55 ± 0.082.51 ± 0.44(n = 3)(n = 3)(n = 3) Open table in a new tab Carotenoids in a symmetric environment in organic solvent show no optical activity (26Koyama Y.

These isoforms were almost undetectable in rat neonatal cerebellar granule cells 1–3 days after plating, but they became highly expressed after 7–9 days of culturing under membrane depolarizing conditions (25 mm KCl).

Changes in the concentration of Ca2+ in the culturing medium affected the expression of the pumps. l-type Ca2+ channel blockers abolished both the up-regulation of the PMCA1CII, 2, and 3 isoforms and the down-regulation of PMCA4 isoform. When granule cells were cultured in high concentrations ofN-methyl-d-aspartic acid, a condition that increased cytosolic Ca2+ through the activation of glutamate-operated Ca2+ channels, up-regulation of PMCA1CII, 2, and 3 and down-regulation of PMCA4 was also observed. The activity of the isoforms was estimated by measuring the phosphoenzyme intermediate of their reaction cycle: the up-regulated isoforms, the activity of which was barely detectable at plating time, accounted for a large portion of the total PMCA activity of the cells. No up-regulation of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump was induced by the depolarizing conditions.

The messenger function of calcium is of particular interest in neuronal cells: processes as important and as diverse as gene expression (1Gallin W.J. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 87-95Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Resink A. Villa M. Benke D. Mohler H. Balázs R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 558-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Both the NMDA receptor and voltage-activated Ca2+ channels mediate the entry of Ca2+ that is necessary to the survival of cultured granule cells (7Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balázs R. Jørgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Ca2+ entering through the voltage-activated Ca2+ channels may modulate the expression of genes different from those controlled by Ca2+ penetrating through the NMDA receptor (1Gallin W.J. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) The sustained increased influx of Ca2+ during the maturation demands the increased capacity of the cells to extrude it. The two classical plasma membrane Ca2+ extruding systems, the Ca2+-ATPase (PMCA) and the Na+-Ca2+-exchanger, have been documented in neurons (17Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Reuter H. Porzig H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1077-1084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Stauffer T.

Acta. 1996; 1280: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) Two of the four PMCA basic gene products, PMCA2 and PMCA3, have in fact only been detected in significant amounts in neurons (19Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), although their transcripts have been detected in other tissues as well (17Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Stauffer T. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of PMCA pump transcription as well as a switching of its isoforms is induced by the addition of NGF to PC-12 cells, which are also widely used as a neuronal cell model (22Hammes A. Oberdorf S. Strehler E.E. Stauffer T. Carafoli E. Vetter H. Neyses L. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A short incubation of IMR32 neuroblastoma cells with 56 mm KCl also induces the transcription of one of the PMCA2 alternatively spliced isoforms (PMCA2AII) (23Zacharias D.A. Dalrtymple S.J. Strehler E.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 28: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Pilot experiments performed at the outset of this work had revealed that the PMCA2, PMCA3, and, to a lesser extent, PMCA4 pumps became up-regulated during the development of the cerebellum. It was thus interesting to investigate whether these isoforms also underwent regulation during the in vitro development of granule cells. The work presented here shows that the expression of the PMCA3 and of the PMCA2 genes increased markedly during the maturation process and was accompanied by the marked up-regulation of the expression of one of the alternatively spliced PMCA1 isoforms. At variance with the findings in intact cerebellum, the maturation process in granule cells induced instead an evident down-regulation of the PMCA4 pump. Both the up- and the down-regulation of the isoforms depended on the sustained increase of intracellular Ca2+. Poly-d-lysine, 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture, and other tissue culture supplements were form Sigma or Life Technologies, Inc. Ditocilpine (MK-801) was from Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA). NMDA, nifedipine, and calcicludine were from Calbiochem. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MGW-Biotech, (Ebersberg, Germany). Ampli-Taq Gold polymerase was from Perkin-Elmer. All other reagents were of the highest purity grade commercially available. Granule cells were dissociated from the cerebella of 7-day old Wistar rats as described (7Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balázs R. Jørgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10D'Mello S.R. Galli C. Ciotti T. Calissano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10989-10993Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). They were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hepes modification (Sigma), containing 1.8 mm CaCl2) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies or Sigma), 100 μg/ml gentamicin, 7 μm p-aminobenzoic acid, 100 μg/ml pyruvate, 100 microunit/ml insulin, on poly-d-lysine-treated plates at a density of 2–3 × 105 cells/cm2, in the presence of 5.3, or 25 mm KCl. After 48 h, 10 μmcytosine arabinofuranoside was added to the culture to inhibit mitotic active cell growth. After 3 additional days, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Sigma), containing 100 μg/ml transferrin, 20 nm progesterone, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 0.11 mg/ml pyruvate in the presence of 5.3 or 25 mm KCl. Neuronal survival was estimated by measuring the amount of colored formazan by the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (24Carmichael J. DeGraff W.G. Gazdar A.F. Minna J.D. Mitchell J.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 943-946PubMed Google Scholar). To this aim, the culture medium was replaced by Locke solution (134 mm NaCl, 4 mm NaHCO3, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) 150 μg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, containing either 5.3 or 25 mm KCl and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The extent of contaminating astrocytes was estimated by immunocytochemistry using a glial fibrillary acidic protein-specific monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). Immunocytochemistry has been performed as described earlier (25Foletti D. Guerini D. Carafoli E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 670-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The cells were in some cases incubated with 1 μg of calcein-AM/ml and 5 μg propidium jodide/ml (both from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 10–15 min at 37 °C and viewed with a fluorescence microscope. Dead cells were stained by propidium iodide and showed a strong emission at 617 nm. Living cells were stained by calcein, resulting in a green fluorescent emission (517 nm). PC-12 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum (both from Life Technologies). They were seeded on laminin coated plates (Collaborative Biomedical Products and Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA), before induction of differentiation with nerve growth factor (20 ng/ml). Three days later neurite outgrowth was observed in at least 30% of the cells, which could be maintained in culture for up to 21 days. P-19 cells were routinely cultured in α-MEM (Life Technologies) supplemented with 2.5% fetal calf serum and 7.5% calf serum (both from Life Technologies). They were exposed to 0.3 μmretinoic acid (26Bain G. Ray W.J. Yao M. Gottlieb D.I. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) at a density of 105cells/ml and transferred to uncoated Petri dishes. After 2 days, cell aggregates were collected, reexposed to retinoic acid for 2 additional days, sedimented, and plated in medium without retinoic acid. After 2 days, 20–40% of the cells extended long neurites and could be kept in culture for up to 9 additional days. Cerebella were dissected from rat brains and homogenized in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 320 mm sucrose, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, antipain, and leupeptin with a loose Potter homogenizer. A crude synaptosomal membrane fraction was obtained after centrifuging the postnuclear supernatant at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The 100,000 × g precipitated material was defined as the microsomal fraction. Cells were resuspended at 5–10 × 106 cells/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 75 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm dithiothreitol and subjected to three cycles of freezing and thawing. The particulate fraction was sedimented at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting protein pellet was resuspended in 4 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% sucrose and frozen at −70 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205478) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose or polyvinyldene difluoride membranes (28Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44642) Google Scholar). The membranes were incubated with affinity-purified isoform-specific polyclonal antibodies against the PMCA pump produced and used essentially as described by Stauffer et al. (19Stauffer T. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) Polyclonal sera (donated by Dr. F. Wuytack, Leuven, Belgium) were used at a 1100 dilution to detect the SERCA2b protein (29Wuytack F. Eggermont J.A. Raeymaekers L. Plessers L. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The JA9 monoclonal antibody specific for the PMCA4 isoforms was provided by Dr. J. Penniston (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). The monoclonal antibody directed to the NMDA receptor NR1 protein (Pharmigen, San Diego, CA) was used at a dilution ranging from 1500 to 12000. The blots were developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT). The reaction was stopped after 2–3 min for the SERCA2b antibody, after 5 min for the affinity-purified serum against the PMCA1, after 10 min for the affinity-purified antibodies for PMCA2 and PMCA3 and for the monoclonal 5F10 antibody, and after 15–25 min for the monoclonal antibody JA9. When the blots were incubated with CDP-Star™ (Tropix, Bedford, MA), they were exposed to the a chemiluminescence-sensitive photographic film. The times were 10–20 s for the SERCA2b antibody, 30–60 s for the affinity-purified serum against the PMCA1, 30–120 s for the affinity-purified antibodies for PMCA2 and PMCA3 and for the 5F10 monoclonal antibody, 60–120 s for the monoclonal antibody JA9. If needed, Western blots were scanned with Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.) and quantified with the help of the National Institutes of Health NIH Image program, Version 1.59. Membrane proteins were resuspended in 20 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 6.8, and 100 mm KCl in the presence of 100 μmCa2+ plus 100 μm La3+. La3+ was included to stabilize the phosphointermediate of the PMCA protein (30Guerini D. Schröder S. Foletti D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14643-14650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The reaction was started with 0.3 μm [γ-32P]ATP (300 Ci/mmol) on ice and stopped 30 s later by the addition of 7% trichloroacetic acid. The proteins in the washed pellet were separated on acidic gels (31Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and exposed for 1–5 days at −70 °C. 160 μg of membrane proteins were phosphorylated with ATP as described above. After precipitation with trichloroacetic acid, the pellet was washed with 200 μl of cold H2O and 0.5% SDS, 8 murea, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.4. The resuspended proteins were diluted to 1000 μl with MEM buffer (50 mm MES-NaOH, pH 6.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 0.2% gelatin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was divided in four 250-μl aliquots. One was mixed with 2–3 μg of 5F10 monoclonal antibody (32Borke J.L. Caride A. Verma A.K. Kelley L.K. Smith C.H. Penniston J.T. Kumar R. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: c341-c346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the others with 3–6 μg of 1N, 2N, or 3N affinity-purified isoform-specific antibodies. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C under gentle rocking prior to the addition of 15 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). After an additional 2 h of incubation at 4 °C, the immunocomplexes bound to protein A-Sepharose were recovered by centrifugation. The pellet was washed four times with MEM buffer supplemented with 0.2% gelatin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS; twice with MEM buffer supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40; and finally, twice with MEM buffer alone. The pellet was resuspended at room temperature and incubated for 30 min in 30–40 μl of 70 mmTris-PO4, pH 6.4, 5% SDS, 5% dithiothreitol, and 8m urea, separated on acidic gels (31Sarkadi B. Enyedi A. Földes-Papp Z. Gardos G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9552-9557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and dried prior the exposure to x-ray films (−70 °C for 2–5 days). The films were scanned with Adobe Photoshop and quantified with the help of NIH Image, Version 1.59. In some cases, they were scanned densitometrically. Total RNA was prepared form granule cells according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62893) Google Scholar). If required, the cells were depolarized with 75 mm KCl for 30 min at 37 °C by the addition of 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 170 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 0.9 mm CaCl2. Control cells were incubated with 75 mm NaCl. cDNA was synthesized using a random octamer primer (First Strand cDNA synthesis kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using the oligonucleotides described by Keeton et al. (17Keeton T.P. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2740-2748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for alternative splicing site C. To study splicing site A, the oligonucleotides described by Adamo and Penniston (34Adamo H.P.

J. 1995; 306: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) were used for PMCA4. For PMCA3, the following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GCGCAAATCAGCAGACAAAG (nt 1448–1467, rat PMCA3) and 5′-TGCAGGACTGACTTCTCCTTC (nt 1715–1735, rat PMCA3). The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G3PDH) cDNA was amplified from rat tissue with the following oligonucleotides: 5′ CCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTCC (nt 371–391) and 5′ GTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC (nt 994–1015). The oligonucleotides for c-fos were derived from the rat sequence (36Curran T. Gordon M.B. Rubino K.L. Sambucetti L.C. Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar) and were as follows: Fos-1, AAGTCTGCGTTGCAGACCGAG (nt 660–680); Fos-2, GTCTGCTGCATAGAAGGAACC (nt 1040–1020). The conditions for the PCR were as suggested by Perkin-Elmer for theTaq Gold polymerase. The PCRs were performed under none saturation conditions, as described by Stauffer et al. (21Stauffer T. Hilfiker H. Carafoli E. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) PCR standard conditions were as follows: 12 min at 95 °C, 33 cycles of 1 min at 50–53 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, 30 s at 93 °C. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose or by 8% PAGE. The identity of the PCR-generated fragments was verified by Southern blotting using oligonucleotides specific for the rat PMCA pump isoforms and by partially sequencing the PCR fragments cloned in the pGEM-T vector (Promega). Northern blotting was performed as described by Sambrook et al. (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Oncogene. 1987; 2: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). Competitive PCR experiments with PMCA2-, PMCA4-, and PMCA1-specific oligonucleotides were performed according to Siebert and Larrick (40Siebert P.D. Larrick J.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 557-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar): they essentially confirmed the Northern blotting experiments. The Northern and Southern blots were scanned with Adobe Photoshop and quantified with the help of NIH Image, Version 1.59. In some cases, the images were scanned densitometrically directly from autoradiographic films. [Ca2+]i was measured by videoimaging as described in Ref. 41Thomas A.P. Delaville F. McCormack J.G. Cobbold P.H. Cellular Calcium: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 1-59Google Scholar. Briefly, granule cells grown on coverslips were loaded for 30 min with 2.5 μm Fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes). Before the analysis the cells were washed twice for 10 min with a buffer of the same ionic composition as the original growth medium and then left to equilibrate at room temperature on the stage of a Leica DM-IRB microscope (Leica AG, Benzheim, Germany) equipped with a Dage-72 CCD camera (Dage-MTI, Michigan City, MI), a videoscope GEN-III image intensifier, and a computer-controlled filter wheel (Sutter, Novato, CA). Images were acquired at λex 340 or 380 nm and λem 505 nm and handled for further processing by an imaging system (Imaging Corp., St. Catherines, Ontario, Canada). For the determination of steady state [Ca2+]i 30 ratio images were recorded during 90 s. The [Ca2+]i was calculated by in situcalibration using the equation [Ca2+]i =K d × (R −R min)/(R max −R) ×S f2/S b2, withK d (25 °C) = 264 nm as described (42Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For the determination of R min, cells were washed twice with calibration buffer (120 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, 15 mm glucose, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA) and equilibrated for 10 min in calibration buffer supplemented with 5 μm ionomycin. For the calculation of Rmax 5 mm Ca2+ and 10 μm ionomycin were added. Autofluorescence was measured after the addition of 10 mm MnCl2. The measurements with Fluo3 were performed as follows. Granule cells grown on glass coverslips were incubated in the original culture medium supplemented with 1 μm Fluo-3-AM for 10 min at 37 °C. They were washed for 5 min at 37 °C in a solution of the same ionic composition as the culture medium and then equilibrated in the same medium without Mg2+ and supplemented with 500 μm tetradotoxin, 20 μm glycine for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were stimulated with 50 μmglutamate, and images were collected using 488 nm excitation and 520 nm emission. Data from 20 neurons were recorded at 2-s intervals with the system described above. The amounts of PMCA1CII, PMCA2, PMCA3, and PMCA 4 proteins varied markedly in synaptosomal preparations from the cerebella of 3-day-old as opposed to 3-week-old rats. The Western blots of Fig.1 show that PMCA proteins were very poorly detectable 3 days after birth (Fig. 1, 3d lanes) but become very prominent after 3 weeks (Fig. 1, 3w lanes). In the case of PMCA1, the increase was particularly marked in the faster migrating band, corresponding to the PMCA1CII isoform (Fig. 1,1N, CII). The overall extent of the up-regulation was particularly evident when synaptosomal membrane proteins were incubated with an antibody that recognized all four PMCA isoforms (Fig. 1,5F10): the increased intensity of the 130-kDa PMCA band evidently reflected the increased expression of the PMCA1CII, PMCA2, PMCA3 and to a lower extent PMCA4 proteins. At the same time a reproducible, if less dramatic, increase of the SERCA pump was observed (Fig. 1, ER2b). Granule cells routinely prepared from the cerebella of 6–8-day-old rats mature in vitro if they were cultured in the presence of depolarizing concentrations of KCl (25 mm). They begin to develop long and widespread processes shortly after plating (1–2 days), and become fully mature after 7–9 days of culturing under optimal conditions. Granule cells cultured in nondepolarizing concentrations of KCl survive for some days (8Balázs R. Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Dev. Brain Res. 1988; 40: 269-276Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), particularly if growth factors are present, but in the experiments described here, the sustained depolarization of the plasma membrane was definitively found to be necessary for their complete maturation, and especially for their long term survival thereafter. As soon as after 5 days of culturing in low potassium, the total number of cells was lower than in high potassium (Fig.2 A), as confirmed by experiments in which the amount of living cells was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide method (not shown). Nevertheless, the morphology of the neurons in high KCl was indistinguishable from that of those surviving in the low potassium culture (see the higher magnification field, in Fig. 2 B). After 5 days in culture, the ratio between viable and nonviable neurons was similar, as indicated by the staining with calcein and propidium iodide (Fig. 2, C and D). In addition, the cells surviving in low KCl were still able to produce Ca2+transients"
https://openalex.org/W2124968202,"TL1 is a recently discovered novel member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine family. TL1 is abundantly expressed in endothelial cells, but its function is not known. The present study was undertaken to explore whether TL1 induces apoptosis in endothelial cells and, if so, to explore its mechanism of action. Cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC) exposed to TL1 showed morphological (including ultrastructural) and biochemical features characteristic of apoptosis. TL1-induced apoptosis in BPAEC was a time- and concentration-dependent process (EC50 = 72 ng/ml). The effect of TL1 was not inhibited by soluble TNF receptors 1 or 2. TL1 up-regulated Fas expression in BPAEC at 8 and 24 h after treatment, and significantly activated stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK). The peak activities of SAPK and p38 MAPK in TL1-treated BPAEC were increased by 9- and 4-fold, respectively. TL1-induced apoptosis in the BPAEC was reduced by expression of a dominant-interfering mutant of c-Jun (62.8%,p < 0.05) or by a specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (1–10 μm) dose-dependently. TL1 also activated caspases in BPAEC, and TL1-induced apoptosis in BPAEC was significantly attenuated by the caspase inhibitor, ZVAD-fluromethyl-ketone. The major component activated by TL1 in BPAEC was caspase-3, which was based on substrate specificity and immunocytochemical analysis. These findings suggest that TL1 may act as an autocrine factor to induce apoptosis in endothelial cells via activation of multiple signaling pathways, including stress protein kinases as well as certain caspases.

TL1 is a novel protein with a molecular mass of 22 kDa identified recently by searching the Human Genome Sciences cDNA data base.

This newly identified member of the TNF family has been demonstrated to be abundantly expressed in endothelial cells as well as in kidney, lung, and prostate. TL1 expression in HL-60 and THP1 cells was induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment. Radiation hybrid mapping localized TL1 gene on chromosome 9q32, near CD30L. Because of its robust expression in endothelial cells, TL1 has been suggested to possibly play a role in vascular functions (1Tan K.B. Harrop J. Reddy M. Young P. Terrett J.E. Moore G. Truneh J. Gene (Amst .). 1997; 204: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). However, no functional study with this novel protein has been reported so far. The present study was undertaken to explore whether TL1 induces endothelial cell apoptosis, a phenomenon suggested to be one cause of endothelial cell damage contributing to various inflammatory disorders and cardiovascular dysfunction (2Bryant D. Becker L. Richardson J. Shelton J. Franco F. Peshock R. Thompson M. Giroir B. Circulation. 1998; 97: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.M. Shen W. Su S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we used bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BPAEC) in which TNFα-induced apoptosis has been demonstrated (4Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Apoptosis was detected on the basis of morphological (including ultrastructural) and biochemical characteristics including DNA fragmentation. In addition, we studied the effects of TL1 on the activity of stress kinases, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK/JNK), and certain caspases. Both signaling pathways are believed to be implicated in programmed cell death (5Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

The expression of Fas and Bcl-2 in TL-1-stimulated BPAEC was also determined in view of the death-promoting effect of Fas and the anti-apoptotic effect of Bcl-2 (9Nagata S. Golstei P.

ZVAD-fmk and Ac-YVAD-CHO were obtained from Enzyme Systems (Dublin, CA) and Peptides International (Louisville, KY), respectively. Ac-DQMD-AMC, Ac-LEED-AMC, Ac-VETD-AMC, and anti-p38 MAPK monoclonal antibodies were provided by SmithKline Beecham (SB) Pharmaceuticals (King of Prussia, PA). Ac-IETD-AMC and mouse-anti-human JNK monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and PharMingen (San Diego, CA), respectively. Mouse soluble TNF receptor 1 (sTNFR1) and TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2) were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). An expression vector containing a 24-amino acid deletion from the N-terminal sequence of the predicted full-length protein (GenBank™ accession number AF039390) was constructed. The DNA sequence encoding TL1 was amplified using polymerase chain reaction oligonucleotide primers specific to the coding sequence of the TL1 gene. Additional nucleotides containing restriction sites to facilitate cloning were added to the 5′ and 3′ sequences, respectively. The 5′ oligonucleotide 5′-GCGCCATGGTGAGACAAACTCCCACA -3′ contained aNcoI restriction site, followed by 18 nucleotides of corresponding coding sequence. The 3′ primer has the sequence 5′-CGCAAGCTTCTATAGTAAGAAGGCTCC-3′ containing a HindIII restriction site followed by 18 nucleotides complementary to the last 15 nucleotides of the coding sequence and the stop codon. The amplified TL1 DNA was cloned into vector pQE60 (Qiagen) after digestion with restriction enzymes and ligation. The ligation mixture was transformed into competent Escherichia coli cells (strain M15/rep4). Expression of the TL1 protein was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and protein was purified from the inclusion bodies into 8 m urea. The solubilized protein was passed over a PD-10 column in 2× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), thereby removing the urea, and refolding the protein. To remove endotoxin, the protein was passed over a polymyxin column. The resulting TL1 preparation was found to be more than 90% pure by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal sequencing. Automated N-terminal sequencing was carried out using a model ABI-494 sequencer (Perkin-Elmer/Applied Biosystems, Inc.) and the Gas-phase Blot cycles. Endotoxin levels were assayed using the Amebocyte Lysate Test (Bio-Whittaker) and were <10 EU of endotoxin/mg of protein (11Ni J. Abrahamson M. Zhang M. Fernandez M. Grubb A. Su J. Yu G.L. Li Y.

BPAEC were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum in a humidified environment of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C as described previously (12Yue T.L. Wang X.K. Louden C.S. Gupta S. Pillarisetti K. Gu J.L. Hart T.K. Lysko P.G. Feuerstein G.Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells at a subconfluent density were used. Before experiments, the medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum. BPAEC from passages 17–20 were used in all studies. To quantify cells undergoing apoptosis, cell monolayers were fixed and stained with Hoechst 33324 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described previously (12Yue T.L. Wang X.K. Louden C.S. Gupta S. Pillarisetti K. Gu J.L. Hart T.K. Lysko P.G. Feuerstein G.Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The morphological features of apoptosis (cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, blebbing, and fragmentation) were monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy study was done as reported previously (12Yue T.L. Wang X.K. Louden C.S. Gupta S. Pillarisetti K. Gu J.L. Hart T.K. Lysko P.G. Feuerstein G.Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells treated with vehicle or TL1 were lysed in lysis buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris·HCl, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml protein kinase K. The lysates were incubated at 55 °C for 16 h. After incubation, the lysates were gently extracted three times with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, precipitated in ethanol, treated with DNase-free RNase, re-extracted, and precipitated again as described previously (12Yue T.L. Wang X.K. Louden C.S. Gupta S. Pillarisetti K. Gu J.L. Hart T.K. Lysko P.G. Feuerstein G.Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). DNA electrophoresis was carried out in 1.8% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide, and DNA fragmentations were visualized under ultraviolet light. BPAEC were cultured in two-chamber slides (Nunc) and treated with TL1 for 8–24 h. In situ detection of apoptotic cells was performed by using terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling with an ApopTag in situ apoptosis detection kit (Oncor) following the manufacturer's recommendation. SAPK activity was measured using GST-c-Jun-(1–81) as bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B as described previously (12Yue T.L. Wang X.K. Louden C.S. Gupta S. Pillarisetti K. Gu J.L. Hart T.K. Lysko P.G.

The cell lysates were immuno-precipitated with anti-p38 MAKP antibody bound to protein A-agarose for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer and then with kinase buffer as described previously (14Kumar S. Orsini M.J. Lee J.C. McDonnell P.C. Debouck C. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30864-30869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The immune complex kinase assay was initiated by the addition of 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of GST-ATF2 and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (20 Ci/mmol). The phosphorylated products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by PhosphorImager. The cells were plated in two-chamber slides. The cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg/ml Pegfp-c-1 (CLONTECH) (15Li Y. Horwitz M.S. Bio/Technology. 1997; 23: 1026-1028Google Scholar) as a fluorescent marker of transfected cells together with 1 μg/ml amounts of either the empty cloning vector pCDNA1 (control) or the dominant-interfering c-Jun mutant pCDNA1-FlgΔ169 (5Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5033) Google Scholar) using the Calphos Maximizer transfection kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Following transfection, the cells were allowed to recover in complete medium for 24 h. The cells were treated with TL1, and the number of apoptotic cells was assessed by nuclear staining after fixation as described under Morphological Assessment and Quantification of Apoptosis. The cells were treated with vehicle or TL1 for a time period indicated in the figure legends. Caspase activity assays were performed with five different substrates under the condition optimal for each caspase as reported previously (13Yue T.L. Wang C. Romanic A.M. Kikly K. Keller P. DeWolf W.E. Hart T.K. Thomas H.C. Storer B. Gu J.L. Wang X. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 495-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Levels of released 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) were measured with a Cytofluor-4000 fluorescent plate reader (Perseptive Biosystems) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm, respectively. The cells were cultured in two-chamber slides. After treatment with vehicle or TL1, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C and then changed to cold PBS. The cells were treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 40 min at 4 °C and washed with cold PBS, and then nonspecific immunoglobulin binding sites were blocked with normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. The cell samples were incubated with the primary antibody: mouse anti-human Fas (Upstate Biotechnology), mouse anti-human Bcl-2 (DAKO), or rabbit anti-human CPP32 p17 peptide polyclonal antisera (provided by Dr. K. Kikly, SmithKline Beecham), for 1 h at room temperature. As a negative control, the cell samples were incubated with nonimmune IgG (for Bcl-2 and CPP32) or IgM (for Fas) instead of the primary antibody. After incubation with the primary antibody, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated for 30 min with a secondary antibody conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate. Cells were washed, treated with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and viewed by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX70). All values in the text and figures are represented as mean ± S.E. of n independent experiments. Statistical evaluation was performed by using one-way analysis of variance. Differences with a value of p < 0.05 were considered significant. The predicted amino acid sequence of TL1 shares 20–30% homology to other members of the TNF family as reported previously (1Tan K.B. Harrop J. Reddy M. Young P. Terrett J.E. Moore G. Truneh J. Gene (Amst .). 1997; 204: 35-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of the protein predicts a hydrophobic region of 10–12 amino acid near the N terminus of the protein following 10–15 non-hydrophobic amino acids and a membrane-anchoring region at the C-terminal region, suggesting that TL1 is a characteristic type II membrane-bound protein. Therefore, we constructed an expression vector containing a 24-amino acid deletion from the N-terminal sequence of TL1. The recombinant TL1 was expressed, purified, and subjected to N-terminal sequencing analysis. The purity of the protein was >90%, which was determined by SDS-PAGE. BPAEC exposed to TL1 shrunk and retracted from their neighboring cells, and their cytoplasma appeared condensed. Cells stained with Hoechst 33324 and assessed by fluorescence microscopy demonstrated condensed chromatin, fragmented nuclei, and blebbing of the plasma membrane (Fig.1 A, panel B). The study with transmission electron microscopy revealed that TL1-treated BPAEC displayed morphologic alterations characteristic of apoptosis including condensation of chromatin and appearance of apoptotic bodies (Fig. 1 B, panel b). The characteristic degradation of DNA into oligonucleosomal-length fragmentation was observed when the cells were exposed to TL1 (30–300 ng/ml) for 24 h (Fig. 1 C). DNA fragments in situ were further visualized by the TUNEL method (Fig. 1 D, panel B). A considerable fraction of endothelial cells treated with TL1 showed positive staining; no positively stained cells were found in the vehicle-treated cultures (Fig. 1 D, panel A). TL1-induced endothelial cell apoptosis was a time- and concentration-dependent process with an EC50 value of 72 ng/ml (Fig. 2). A significant increase in the number of cells with apoptotic morphology was apparent 6–8 h after exposure of the cells to TL1. Under similar conditions, TNF-α, at 10 ng/ml, induced apoptosis in BEAPC by 16.7 ± 3.2% (n = 4). Neither sTNFR1 nor sTNFR2 at 30 μg/ml showed effect on TL1 (0.1 μg/ml)-induced apoptosis in BPAEC. Under the same condition TNFα-induced apoptosis in BPAEC was reduced by sTNFR1 significantly (data not shown). Immunocytochemical analysis of Fas and Bcl-2 proteins was determined at 8 and 24 h after treatment with TL1. Fas antigen was not detectable at resting BPAEC (Fig.3 A). However, a significant number of cells expressing Fas receptor were detected at 8 and 24 h after stimulation (Fig. 3, B and C). When mouse IgM was substituted for the primary antibody, positive Fas immunoreactivity was not detected. In contrast, Bcl-2 expression was not detected in either unstimulated or TL1-treated BPAEC (data not shown). The effects of TL1 on SAPK/JNK activity in BPAEC are shown in Fig.4. Exposure of endothelial cells to TL1 induced a rapid activation of SAPK/JNK. A significant increase in SAPK/JNK activity was detected 20 min after stimulation, peaked at 40 min, and then returned to the basal levels after 60 min (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig. 4 B, TL1-induced activation of SAPK/JNK in endothelial cells was a concentration-dependent process. The SAPK/JNK activity was increased by 5.6 ± 1.4-fold (p < 0.05,n = 4) and 9.1 ± 1.8-fold (p < 0.01, n = 6) over the basal level in the presence of 50 and 300 ng/ml TL1, respectively. The effects of TL1 on p38 MAPK activity are shown in Fig.5. TL1 activated p38 MAPK in BPAEC with a similar time course as SAPK/JNK but a lesser extent. The peak of p38 MAKP activity was increased by 3.1 ± 0.5- and 3.8 ± 0.4-fold over the basal level in the presence of 100 and 300 ng/ml TL1, respectively. To investigate the role of SAPK/JNK in TL1-induced apoptosis in BPAEC, we transfected BPAEC with a dominant-interfering mutant of c-Jun, pCDNA1-FlagΔ169, in which a deletion in the N-terminal transactivation domain that includes the binding site for JNK (5Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5033) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, expression of dominant-interfering c-Jun construct in BPAEC reduced TL1-induced apoptosis by 62.8% (p < 0.05). TL1-induced apoptosis in BPAEC was also attenuated by a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580 (23Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar), in a concentration-dependent manner as shown in Fig.7. In the presence of 3 and 10 μm SB203580, TL1-induced BPAEC apoptosis was reduced by 33% (p < 0.05) and 51% (p < 0.01), respectively. No further inhibition was observed when the concentration of SB203580 was increased.Figure 7Effect of SB203580 on TL1-induced apoptosis in BPAEC. The BPAEC were incubated with vehicle or SB203580 at the concentrations indicated for 30 min, and TL1 (100 ng/ml) was added, and the incubation continued for 20 h. The cells were fixed and stained with Hoechst, and the number of apoptotic cells was counted.

Well M. Raff M.C.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), added to the culture medium 1 h prior to TL1 treatment. Under the same conditions, the addition of Ac-YVAD-CHO, a relatively specific inhibitor of caspase-1 (17Thornberry N.A. Bull H.G. Calaycay J.R. Chapman K.T. Howard A.D. Kostura M.J. Miller D.K.

Nature. 1992; 356: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar), up to 100 μm showed no effect in enhancing BPAEC rescue (data not shown). To further determine which of the caspase family members are activated in the TL1-induced apoptotic process in the endothelial cells, we examined cell extracts for proteolytic activity. The relative rates of AMC formation were measured with a series of defined peptide sequence variants that are relatively specific for caspase 1, 3, 4, 7, or 8 under the optimal conditions as described previously (13Yue T.L. Wang C. Romanic A.M. Kikly K. Keller P. DeWolf W.E. Hart T.K. Thomas H.C. Storer B. Gu J.L. Wang X. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 495-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and presented in Fig. 9 A. Similar results were observed from three repeated experiments. Cell extracts from TL1-treated BPAEC were highly active on Ac-DEVD-AMC and to a lesser extent on Ac-DQMD-AMC, but not active on the remaining three substrates which are more specific for caspase 1, 4, and 8. The proteolytic activity appeared at 6 h after the cells were treated with TL1, peaked at 24 h, and gradually returned to basal levels within 48 h. Fig. 9 B shows a comparison of the relative velocities of four substrate hydrolysis rates by the TL1-treated cell extracts and the recombinant caspase-3. The relative velocities of the two enzyme sources on four substrates were very similar.Figure 9A, activation of caspases in BPAEC by TL1. BPAEC were treated with TL1 (100 ng/ml) for the indicated time period. Cell extracts were assayed at each time point with five different substrates under the condition optimal for each caspase as reported in Ref. 13Yue T.L. Wang C. Romanic A.M. Kikly K. Keller P.

AMC formation was measured, and the specific activities were calculated from rates of product formation from each tetrapeptide-AMC substrate. B, comparison of BPAEC extract with recombinant caspase-3 for substrate specificity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further confirm the activation of caspase-3 in TL1-stimulated BPAEC, immunocytochemical detection of its enzymatically active form, the 17-kDa subunit, was performed. The antibody used was raised against a peptide derived from the C-terminal portion of the p17 subunit. The neoepitope antibody only binds caspase-3 following specific cleavage between the p10 and p20 subunits (13Yue T.L. Wang C. Romanic A.M. Kikly K. Keller P. DeWolf W.E. Hart T.K. Thomas H.C. Storer B. Gu J.L. Wang X. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 495-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.10, the 17-kDa subunit of caspase-3 was detected in TL1-treated but not vehicle-treated BPAEC, and was localized with fragmented nuclei within the cells. The studies presented in this paper demonstrate that TL1, a novel TNF-like cytokine and a type II transmembrane protein, induces intensive apoptosis in cultured endothelial cells as reflected by morphological and biochemical criteria. Under our experimental conditions, spontaneous BPAEC death rate was approximately 2–4%, well in accord with a previous observation (4Polunovsky V.A. Wendt C.H. Ingbar D.H. Peterson M.S. Bitterman P.B. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 584-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The effect of TL1 was concentration-dependent with an EC50 value of 72 ng/ml (3.5 nm), and a significant number of apoptotic cells were detected 6–8 h after treatment. Moreover, the expression of pro-apoptotic gene, Fas, was demonstrated in TL1-treated BPAEC, which is consistent with that observed in apoptotic endothelial cells reported previously (12Yue T.L. Wang X.K. Louden C.S. Gupta S. Pillarisetti K. Gu J.L. Hart T.K. Lysko P.G. Feuerstein G.Z. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The receptor(s) mediating TL1 activity has not been identified as yet. To examine whether TL1 acts via distinct receptor(s) or shares the known TNFR1 or TNFR2, we tested the effects of sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 on TL-1-induced apoptosis in BPAEC. These two TNFRs have been shown previously to block the cell surface TNFR1 and TNFR2 mediated TNF bioactivities on responsive cell lines (data from R&D Systems). However, neither sTNFR1 nor sTNFR2 inhibited the effect of TL1 on BPAEC. In contrast, TNFα-induced apoptosis in BPAEC was significantly reduced by sTNF1. The results suggest clearly that TL1-induced cell death is independent of TNFR1 or TNFR2. Recent research efforts on TNF family members have demonstrated that TNFα and Fas activate stress protein kinases, SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK, in a variety of cell types (18Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R. Mol . Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8376-8384Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 19Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar); however, the effects of other members of this family on SAPK and p38 MAPK have not been well studied. Moreover, controversies regarding the role of SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK in TNFα- or Fas-mediated cell death have been reported. For example, TNFα-induced apoptosis is dependent on JNK activity in U937 cells (6Verjeij M. Rose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1995; 380: 75-79Crossref Scopus (1714) Google Scholar,20Zanke B.W. Boudreau K. Rubie E. Winnet E. Tibbles L.A. Zon L. Kyriakis J. Liu F. Woodget J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 606-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) but not in fibroblasts (21Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shyamala V. Williams T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), indicating that the consequences of JNK activation vary considerably among cell types. Fas-mediated JNK activation occurs with a different kinetics from that of TNFα, suggesting that TNFα and Fas most likely activate JNK through a different mechanism (22Wilson D.J. Fortner K.A. Lynch D.H. Mattingly R.R. Macara I.G. Posada J.A. Budd R.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Moreover, Juo et al. (19Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) reported recently that blockade of p38 MAPK by a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor did not affect Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Therefore, we were interested in finding whether TL1 activates JNK and p38 MAPK, and what is the role of this activation in TL1-mediated apoptosis in BPAEC. The present investigation clearly demonstrates that both JNK and p38 MAPK were rapidly activated by TL1 in a similar fashion to that observed in TNFα-activated U937 cells. Moreover, expression of dominant-interfering mutant of c-Jun in BPAEC reduced TL1-induced cell death indicating that TL1-induced apoptosis in BPAEC was dependent on JNK activity. To address the potential involvement of p38 MAPK in TL1-mediated apoptosis in BPAEC, a specific p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 was tested. This inhibitor has been shown to specifically inhibit p38 MAPK activity in vitro, with no effect on a variety of kinases tested, including JNK-1 and ERK-1 (23Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, TL1-induced apoptosis in BPAEC was also reduced by SB203580 in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that p38 MAPK signaling pathway is involved in TL1-mediated BPAEC apoptosis. This effect is different from that observed in Fas-mediated apoptosis in Jurkat cells, in which SB203580 had no protective effect (19Juo P. Kuo C.J. Reynolds S.E. Konz R.F. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Biemann H.-P. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Moreover, TL1-induced p38 MAPK activation occurs with much faster kinetics in BPAEC than that observed in Jurkat cells, in which the peak of p38 MAPK activation was at 2–4 h after stimulation by Fas, indicating TL1 and Fas most likely activate p38 MAPK through a different mechanism with a different outcome. Our data further suggest that different members of the TNF family may have different signaling pathways to mediate cell death or have different effects in different cell types. Recent work has supported a central role for the caspase family members, as effectors of apoptosis (24Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar). However, the role of caspases in endothelial cell apoptosis has not been sufficiently explored. Among the caspase family, caspase-3 (CPP32) has been considered as a central component of the proteolytic cascade during apoptosis and plays a key role in this family (25Wang X. Zelenski N.G. Yang J. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1012-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 26Woo M. Haker K. Soengas M.S. Duncan G.S. Shahinian A. Kagi D. Hakem A. Mccurranch M. Khoo W. Kaufman S.A. Senaldi G. Howard T. Lowe S.W. Mak T.W. Gene Dev. 1998; 12: 806-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). TL1-induced BPAEC apoptosis was inhibited by ZVAD-fmk, indicating a potential role for the caspase family in this effector pathway for apoptosis. To determine which of the caspase family members are involved, we examined the substrate specificity of proteolytic activity in the extracts from TL1-activated BPAEC by measuring the relative rate of AMC formation from six different substrates, which are relatively specific for caspases 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 (27Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Treatment of BPAEC with TL1 resulted in a significant increase in proteolytic activity toward DEVD-AMC mainly and DQMD-AMC to some extent, both of which show the relative specificity for caspase-3 (13Yue T.L. Wang C. Romanic A.M. Kikly K. Keller P. DeWolf W.E. Hart T.K. Thomas H.C. Storer B. Gu J.L. Wang X. Feuerstein G.Z. J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). There was no induction in proteolytic activity in TL1-activated cell extracts when Ac-YVAD-AMC, LEED-AMC, or VETD-AMC were used as the substrate, indicating that caspases 1, 4, and 8 might not be involved. Moreover, comparison of the substrate specificity of the extracts from TL1-treated BPAEC with the recombinant caspase-3 showed a similar pattern, further suggesting that caspase-3 may be the predominant member in the caspase family activated by TL1. Furthermore, immunocytochemical studies detected the active form of caspase-3 in TL1-treated BPAEC. It was reported that multiple caspase homologues were found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in etoposide-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells (28Martins L.M. Kottke T. Mesner P.W. Basi G.S. Sinha S. Frigon Jr., N. Tatar E. Tung J.S. Bryant K. Takahashi A. Svingen P.A. Madden B.J. McCormick D.J. Earnshaw W.C. Kaufmann S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7421-7430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in TL1-induced apoptotic BPAEC, the immunoreactive 17-kDa subunit of caspase-3 was only localized with fragmented nuclei, further indicating a role of caspase-3 in TL1-induced apoptosis. Whether this active caspase-3 was transported into the neucleus or the inactive caspase-3 is already in the nucleus awaiting activation promoted by TL1 requires further investigation. Taken together, these results suggest that caspase-3 was activated by TL1 in BPAEC and may mediate TL1-induced cell apoptosis. However, our results cannot exclude other members of this family, especially those closely related to caspase-3, such as caspase-7, in mediating TL1-induced apoptosis. In summary, the present studies have demonstrated that TL1, a novel member of TNF cytokine family, causes endothelial cell apoptosis. TL1 appears to act through a receptor that is distinct from TNF receptors 1 or 2. The effect of TL1 is via activation of the stress protein kinases, SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK, and the caspases, mainly caspase-3-like protease. Apoptotic programmed cell death has been suggested to be a cause of endothelial cell damage contributing to various inflammatory disorders and cardiovascular injury (29Karsan A. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, endothelial cell apoptosis may be an important mechanism involved in a balance between antiangiogenic and proangiogenic processes, and loss of this balance will lead to a variety of diseases such as solid tumor metastasis and retinopathy (30Folkman J. Shing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Kiler G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2177) Google Scholar). Therefore, the biological significance and the potential roles of TL1 in these pathophysiological conditions, and the mechanism for regulation of TL1 production in endothelial cells require further studies.

It is structured in three domains, one C-terminal highly acidic domain and two basic domains, A and B. The structures of the A and B domains have been solved in solution by NMR (1Hardman C.H.

Both domains adopt a very similar L-shaped structure, formed by two short and one long α-helix, that is known as the HMG box domain. An increasing number of proteins containing one or more HMG box domains have been described; the HMG box domains for which the structure has been solved, such as the ones in LEF-1 or SRY, are very similar to the HMG box domains of HMG1 (3Love J.J.

Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, whereas SRY and LEF-1 interact with DNA in the minor groove with a certain sequence specificity, HMG1 (and the related protein HMG2) does not interact specifically with regular B-DNA. Nevertheless, HMG1 shows a clear preference for binding angled structures in the DNA without any sequence specificity, such as cisplatin-modified DNA, bulged DNA, or four-way DNA junctions (5Bianchi M.E.

Here we describe a remarkably species-specific interaction of HMG1 with human TBP that affects the interaction of TFIIB with hTBP and is competed by TFIIA. The interaction takes place between the highly conserved core domain of hTBP and the HMG1 box A domain; HMG box A also interacts with the high molecular mass TFIID complex in crude nuclear extracts. HMG box A represses transcription in vitro on its own, and this activity can be significantly increased by using Gal4-binding domain fusions. Plasmids pT7-HMG1bA and pT7-HMG1bB, expressing rat HMG1 boxes A and B, respectively, have already been described (19Bianchi M.E. Falciola L. Ferrari S. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). pET14b-HMG1 was constructed by inserting anNdeI-BamHI insert from pT7-HMG1 (20Bianchi M.E. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 104: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in pET14b (Novagen). An internal NdeI site at position +44 in HMG1 was previously mutated without affecting the amino acidic sequence. Constructs expressing His6-tagged human and yeast TBP were provided by A. Hoffmann and R. Roeder (The Rockefeller University, New York) and J.-M. Egly (Institut de Génétique, Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), Illkirch, France), respectively. The human TFIIB expression plasmid was obtained from D. Reinberg (Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry, Piscataway, NJ). pGST-HMG1box A was constructed by inserting aNcoI-EcoO109 (Klenow-filled) fragment from pET14b-HMG1 into pGEX-KG digested with HindIII (Klenow-filled) and NcoI. pGST-HMG1box B was constructed by inserting an NdeI (Klenow-filled)-HindIII fragment obtained from pT7-HMG1bB into a pGEX-KG digested withSmaI and HindIII. pGEX-KG is a derivative of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an extended polylinker. pET14b-Gal4BD-HMG1box A was obtained by ligating the sequence corresponding to domain A, excised from pET14b-HMG1 withNdeI and AvaI and filled in with Klenow enzyme, to the SmaI site of pET14b-Gal4BD; pET14-Gal4BD-HMG1box B was constructed by ligating the sequence corresponding to domain B, excised from pT7-HMG1bB with NdeI and HindIII and filled in with Klenow enzyme, to the SmaI site of pET14-Gal4BD. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of HMG1 boxes A and B were carried out inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells as described (19Bianchi M.E. Falciola L. Ferrari S. Lilley D.M.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) except that they were further purified over FPLC-MonoS columns using a 0–1m KCl gradient in buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). HMG1 box A elutes at 0.6 m KCl and box B at 0.2 mKCl. Selected fractions were pooled, dialyzed versus 0.1m KCl-buffer D, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant His6-tagged HMG1 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysE cells at 30 °C for 2 h and purified over Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate columns exactly as described for human TBP (21Bernués J. Simmen K.A. Lewis J.D. Gunderson S.I. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3573-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fractions containing HMG1 were further purified by FPLC over MonoQ columns using a 0.05–1 m KCl gradient in buffer D. HMG1, which elutes at 0.5 m KCl, was dialyzedversus 0.1 m KCl-buffer D, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Expression and purification of yeast and human TBP were done as described (22Bernués J. Carrera P. Azorı́n F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Human TBP mutants in pQE vectors were expressed and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate columns as described above and further purified on FPLC-MonoS columns. For pull-down experiments, the soluble fraction of crude extracts was used without further purification. Recombinant human TFIIB was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (23Ha I. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Nature. 1991; 352: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). TFIIA was purified from HeLa nuclear extracts exactly as described (24Meisterernst M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1991; 67: 557-567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). GST and GST box A and box B were expressed and purified as suggested by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST, GST box A, or GST box B were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads in 0.1 mNaCl-buffer D containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Protein in excess was washed away with the same buffer. For each experiment, 20 μl of beads were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with extracts in a final volume of 450 μl. After exhaustive washing of the beads with the same buffer, retained proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. Proteins were separated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (BA-85, Schleicher & Schuell), probed with specific antibodies, and detected using ECL reagents. Gel retardation analysis was performed by incubating the proteins and the TATA box WT probe for 30 min at 30 °C (22Bernués J. Carrera P. Azorı́n F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Supershifting of the bands included an additional incubation with the antibody for 10 min before loading the gels. Antibodies used were a monoclonal anti-TFIIB (Promega) and 3G3 anti-hTBP monoclonal antibody (a gift from P. Chambon, IGBMC). Hydroxyl radical footprinting was done as described (25Lee S. Hahn S. Nature. 1995; 376: 609-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, after assembly of complexes under the same conditions as for EMSA but omitting glycerol, samples were subjected to hydroxyl radical digestion conditions, and the reaction was quenched by glycerol addition. Samples were then run on nondenaturing EMSA gels and the corresponding complexes excised from the gels after visualization by autoradiography. DNA was eluted and analyzed in denaturing 20% polyacrylamide gels. In vitrotranscription reactions were done and analyzed as described (21Bernués J. Simmen K.A. Lewis J.D. Gunderson S.I. Polycarpou-Schwarz M. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Mattaj I.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3573-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The 8xGal4-WT DNA template was constructed by multimerization of a pair of synthetic oligonucleotides containing a monomer of the Gal4-binding site sequence (CGGAGTACTGTCCTCCG and CGGAGGACAGTACTCCG) and ligation to the EcoRI site, made blunt by repair with Klenow enzyme, of the WT G-less construct previously described (22Bernués J. Carrera P. Azorı́n F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2950-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The involvement of HMG1 (and HMG2) in the transcription process has long been a matter of discussion, and apparently opposite results have been reported. Transcription from pol II requires the formation of a pre-initiation complex (PIC). This process is begun by the recognition of the TATA box by TBP. Then, TFIIA and TFIIB join the initial complex, followed by several other factors until the whole set of basal factors plus RNA pol II are ready to start transcription (26Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). With the aim of clarifying the role of HMG1 in RNA pol II transcription, we have studied its involvement in several of the very beginning steps of PIC formation. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the interaction of HMG1 with human TBP was clearly seen in an EMSA gel, whereas it could not be detected when using yeast TBP (comparelanes 5 and 10). Notice that in the gel conditions used, TBP interaction with the TATA box on its own was very unstable and could hardly be detected (see Fig. 1, A(lanes 2 and 6) and B (lanes 1 and 5)) as originally described (27Auble D.T. Hahn S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 844-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The interaction of HMG1 with the hTBP-TATA complex (hD) gave rise to a clear complex HMG1-hTBP (hD-HMG1) (Fig. 1 A, lane 5), suggesting that HMG1 stabilized the binding of hTBP to the TATA box. Moreover, this interaction also took place with the TFIIB-hTBP complex (hD-IIB), giving rise to the HMG1-hTBP-TFIIB complex (hD-HMG1-IIB, lane 4). Remarkably, the presence of HMG1 in the HMG1-hTBP-TFIIB complex did not result in a band of lower electrophoretic mobility but rather of intermediate mobility between the hTBP-TFIIB and the HMG1-hTBP complexes (compare lane 4 with lanes 3 and 5). HMG1 did not bind significantly to DNA in the absence of TBP (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). Human and yeast TBPs share a highly conserved C-terminal region (the so-called core domain) with 81% sequence identity, whereas the N-terminal domains do not show any significant homology. Fig.1 B shows that using human core TBP (hcTBP), HMG1 still interacts with hcTBP and gives rise to a HMG1-hcTBP-TFIIB complex with anomalous electrophoretic mobility as shown above (hcD-HMG1-IIB, lane 3). The interaction of hcTBP with HMG1 looks weaker in this case (lane 4). Yeast core TBP (ycTBP) was also assayed for interaction with HMG1 (lanes 7–10) either alone or in the presence of TFIIB. Results show that ycTBP interacted with TFIIB (lane 6) but not with HMG1, ruling out any potential interference by the yTBP N terminus. The presence of increasing amounts of HMG1 appeared somehow to interfere with the formation of the ycTBP-TFIIB complex (Fig. 1 B,lanes 6–9). This interference never resulted in the formation of a new complex containing ycTBP and might reflect a very weak interaction that cannot be observed with the full-length yTBP (Fig. 1 A, lanes 7–9). All of these results indicate that the core domain of hTBP contains the primary binding site for HMG1, most likely in a region not conserved in the yeast TBP. EMSA experiments (Fig. 2) showed no evidence for a hypothetical TFIIA-HMG1-hTBP ternary complex. Instead, bands of the hTBP-TFIIA and hTBP-HMG1 complexes appeared at the same time (hD-IIA and hD-HMG1, Fig. 2, lanes 12 and 13 and 15 and 16), and their intensities were inversely correlated. There was no detectable interaction either with yTBP or yTBP-TFIIA, but there was a faint interference as the amount of HMG1 increased (lanes 3–5). This effect became weaker at higher amounts of TFIIA (lanes 6–8). Because homologous hTBP-hTFIIA complexes have been reported to be more stable than heterologous yTBP-hTFIIA complexes (28Lee D.K. Dejong J. Hashimoto S. Horikoshi M. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5189-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), this effect might reflect a very weak interaction that cannot give rise to a defined band, as suggested above. The same results were obtained when the core versions of yeast and human TBPs were assayed (results not shown). Altogether, the results suggest that HMG1 does not interact with TFIIA and that their binding sites on hTBP may be in close proximity. The simplest explanation for the anomalous mobility of the HMG1-hTBP-TFIIB complex may be that the overall arrangement of subunits in the complex was different from the hTBP-TFIIB and hTBP-HMG1 complexes. To test this hypothesis, the hTBP-TFIIB, HMG1-hTBP-TFIIB, and hTBP-HMG1 complexes were assembled and then incubated with monoclonal antibodies against hTBP or TFIIB (Fig.3). Lanes 3–5 in Fig. 3 are controls run with the hTBP-TFIIB complex. Lanes 9–11 show the presence of hTBP in the hTBP-HMG1 complex and the lack of reaction with anti-TFIIB. Note that the amount of the complex supershifted with the anti-hTBP antibody was clearly reduced in the HMG1-hTBP complex (and also in the HMG1-hTBP-TFIIB) when compared with the TFIIB-hTBP complex (Fig. 3, lanes 10, 7, and 4,respectively). Since the antibody used (3G3) recognizes residues 1–17 of hTBP (29Brou C. Chaudary S. Davidson I. Lutz Y. Wu J. Egly J.-M. Tora L. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), these residues are probably close to HMG1 in the complex.Lanes 6 and 7 show that the HMG1-hTBP-TFIIB complex could still be supershifted with the anti-hTBP antibody, although at a very moderate level. Upon addition of the anti-TFIIB antibody, the HMG1-hTBP-TFIIB complex was not supershifted but actually disappeared (lane 8); at the same time, the band representing the HMG1-hTBP complex became prominent. Unfortunately, the presence of HMG1 in the complexes could not be observed directly because anti-HMG1 antibodies do not supershift HMG1 complexes (results not shown). These results suggest that TFIIB is weakly bound within the complex so that the addition of the anti-TFIIB antibody (but not the anti-hTBP antibody) is sufficient to displace it.Figure 4Hydroxyl radical footprinting of the TBP-containing complexes. The three complexes studied, hTBP-TFIIB (lanes 2 and 3), hTBP-HMG1-TFIIB (lanes 4 and 5), and hTBP-HMG1 (lanes 6 and7) were reacted with hydroxyl radicals as indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Free and bound DNAs (F andB, respectively) are analyzed on a 20% polyacrylamide sequencing gel. The footprints of hTBP and TFIIB are indicated on theleft. L, G + A ladders. The 5′ to 3′ orientation and the sequence of the TATA box are indicated on theright.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We obtained more direct evidence on the status of TFIIB in the different complexes by hydroxyl radical footprinting. Fig.4 shows a clear hTBP footprint encompassing the TATATA sequence in the three complexes. The protection resulting from TFIIB and centered around position −17 could be observed for the TFIIB-hTBP complex but was absent in the HMG1-hTBP-TFIIB complex. This suggests that TFIIB is not stably bound to DNA in the presence of HMG1 and accounts for the reduced stability and the anomalous electrophoretic mobility of the complex shown above. In these experiments, there was no evidence for specific contacts of HMG1 with DNA in any complex. These results indicate that the interaction of HMG1 with hTBP affects the interaction of TFIIB with hTBP. We identified the hTBP segment involved in the interaction with HMG1 by screening the point mutations on the surfaces of hTBP that are not engaged with DNA in the hTBP-TATA box complex. EMSA analysis of mutants in all helical tracts (hTBP-WT, -IIA, -H1, -H1′, and -H2, mostly double point mutations (30Tansey W.P. Ruppert S. Tjian R. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2756-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)), kindly provided by Bill Tansey and Winship Herr, showed no remarkable effect on HMG1 interaction (not shown). The mutant in helix H2′ (-H2′), although stable in E. coli, looked to be incorrectly folded and could not be tested. To circumvent this problem, a second set of single point mutations, kindly provided by A. Berk, was assayed (31Bryant G.O. Martel L.S. Burley S.K. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2491-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We studied mutations on helix H2′ and concentrated on the nonconservative changes observed between human and yeast TBPs. A pull-down assay using GST fusions to domains A and B of HMG1 was used. Only domain A, encompassing residues 1–89, showed a clear interaction with wild type hTBP (Fig. 5); domain B did not show any significant affinity for hTBP. The interaction was not strongly affected in any hTBP mutant except for the Asn → Glu substitution at position 327. In this case, a 5–10-fold lower affinity was consistently observed. Similar results have been observed in EMSA assays using full-length HMG1. Mutant 327 fully supported basal transcription in in vitro assays (results not shown). All of these results indicate that HMG1 interacts with human TBP primarily by making contact with its HMG box A to the helix H2′ of hTBP, likely involving Asn-327 as an important residue. TBP has been shown to exist in mammalian cells in the form of several complexes, at least one for each polymerase; there is probably no free TBP in the cell nucleus. For RNA pol II transcription, TBP exists in the form of ΤFIID, a high molecular mass oligomer (>700 kDa) containing TBP and a set of other polypeptides called TAFs. As shown in Fig.6, we have found that HMG box A can efficiently pull down TFIID from crude HeLa cell nuclear extracts, as revealed by the presence of hTBP and TAFII135 in the retained material. HMG box B did not show any significant affinity for any form of TBP in the same extracts. In similar experiments, we observed no evidence for interaction of HMG box A with TFIIIB, the TBP-containing complex for pol III, suggesting an involvement of HMG1 mostly in RNA pol II transcription (results not shown). The addition of increasing amounts of HMG1 to an in vitrotranscription reaction has already been shown to result in repression of both basal and activated transcription. However, to obtain these results large amounts of HMG1 or -2 must be added (Refs. 11Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 16Stelzer G. Goppelt A. Lottspeich F. Meisterernst M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4712-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar; and results not shown). We prepared Gal4-binding domain fusions to domains A and B of HMG1 to increase the efficiency of promoter loading and reduce the amounts required. We used the hybrid proteins in transcription assays in vitro with a template with 8xGal4 binding sites (Fig. 7 A) or a control template with no binding sites (Fig. 7 B) fused to a minimal promoter. Titration of Gal4 box A (Fig. 7, A(lanes 2–6) and B (lanes 2–4)) resulted in repression, which was more efficient on the 8xGal4 template. Gal4 box B titration resulted in an overall repression activity when the template tested had no Gal4 binding sites (Fig.7 B, lanes 5–7). However, a two-step behavior was observed when using the 8xGal4 template. At low concentrations, there was no repression; instead, a moderate (around 1.5-fold) although reproducible activation was consistently observed (Fig. 7 A, lanes 8 and9). At higher concentrations, a repressing effect was noticed (Fig. 7 A, lanes 10–12). These differences suggest that depending on the way domain B enters the PIC, it may repress or enhance transcription. At the same protein concentrations, Gal4 box A was more efficient in repressing transcription than Gal4 box B when using the 8xGal4 template. From the remaining transcriptional activities (16.5 and 86.8% for Gal4 box A and Gal4 box B in lanes 4 and10 of Fig. 7 A, respectively), we can estimate that Gal4 box A is around 5-fold more efficient than Gal4 box B in repressing basal transcription. However, this difference practically disappeared when the template carried no Gal4 binding sites (e.g. compare lanes 3 and 6 on Fig.7 B). These results suggest a specific repression by domain A targeted to the promoter. Remarkably, and in contrast to domain B, the addition of Gal4 box A never showed any positive effect at any concentration, suggesting again that boxes A and B, although similar, are not equivalent and that they likely play different roles in RNA pol II transcription in the context of the intact HMG1 protein. The involvement of HMG1 (and HMG2) in transcription has been suspected for a long time, and apparently different results have been reported. Depending on the different systems and conditions used, either repression or activation of transcription has been observedin vitro (11Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Oñate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell.

The conflicting results may be the effect of the shortcomings of in vitro reconstituted systems and thus biologically meaningless, or they may come from subtly different activities of HMG1 on the promoter of different genes. Here, we have studied in detail the interaction of HMG1 with TBP in PIC formation to gain some clues on the possible mechanisms of action. Ge and Roeder (11Ge H. Roeder R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17136-17140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) first reported that HMG1 can interact with hTBP. Our results were in agreement with theirs and, surprisingly, showed that this interaction is species-specific. The contact surface of the interacting partners has been mapped; we determined that only box A of HMG1 interacts with hTBP. This is remarkable because to this point domains A and B had been shown to be absolutely equivalent for binding to cruciform and cisplatin-modified DNA (6Locker D. Decoville M. Maurizot J.C. Bianchi M.E. Leng M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Bianchi M.E. Lilley D.M.J. DNA-Protein: Structural Interactions.

The exact surface of HMG box A involved in the interaction with hTBP is not known; however, molecular docking analysis rules out the concave side of the L-shaped domain, which has been shown to interact in the minor groove of DNA (32Falciola L. Murchie A.I.H. Lilley D.M.J. Bianchi M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 22: 285-292Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). HMG1 interacts with human TBP but not detectably with yeast TBP, and the interaction takes place on the core domain. Because of the extensive sequence identity, a nonconserved region within the TBP core domain was a likely candidate to explain the results. In fact, we identified helix H2′ of hTBP as the HMG1 primary binding site; a single point mutation that converts residue 327 from Asn t"

The goal of this study was to extend our previous study on the functional characterization and post-translational modification of a mouse kidney organic anion transporter (mOAT), in a mammalian cell system, COS-7 cells. The transporter-mediated p-aminohippurate (PAH) uptake was saturable, probenecid-sensitive, and inhibited by a wide range of organic anions including vitamins, anti-hypertensive drugs, anti-tumor drugs, and anti-inflammatory drugs. Tunicamycin, an inhibitor of asparagine-linked glycosylation, significantly inhibited the transport activity. Immunofluorescence provided evidence that most of the protein remained in the intracellular compartment in tunicamycin-treated cells. Diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), a histidine residue-specific reagent, completely blocked PAH transport. The inhibitory effect by DEPC was significantly protected (90%) by pretreating the cells with excess unlabeled PAH, suggesting that the histidine residues may be close to the PAH binding sites. Finally,in situ mRNA localization was studied in postnatal mouse kidney. The expression was observed in proximal tubules throughout development. We conclude that COS-7 cells may be useful in pharmacological and molecular biological studies of this carrier. The carbohydrate moieties are necessary for the proper trafficking of mOAT to the plasma membrane, and histidine residues appear to be important for the transport function.

Renal organic anion transport plays a vital role in the elimination of a wide variety of potentially toxic, negatively charged waste products of metabolism, drugs, environmental pollutants, and their metabolites from the body. The transport mechanisms responsible for this elimination have been studied extensively (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 2Ullrich K.J. Rumrich G. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: F453-F462PubMed Google Scholar, 3Moller J.V. Sheikh M.I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1983; 34: 315-358Google Scholar). Based on these studies, it has been suggested that the transport of organic anions is a complex process involving distinctly different proteins at the apical and basolateral membranes of the proximal tubule cells. Organic anions are transported across the basolateral membrane into the cell in exchange for intracellular dicarboxylates, which are subsequently returned into the cell via a sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter. The luminal exit of organic anions is thought to occur by anion exchange and/or facilitated diffusion (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol.

The availability of the cDNA that encodes the organic anion transporter protein enables us to begin to unravel the structure-function relationship of this elimination system at the molecular level. We predicted in our early study (7Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G. Bush K.T. Barros E.J.G. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) that the extracellular loop between putative transmembrane regions 1 and 2 contains four potentialN-linked glycosylation consensus sites at positions Asn-56, Asn-86, Asn-91, and Asn-107. The same profile was also observed in its isoforms from rat and winter flounder (4Sweet D.H. Wolff N.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 287-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The presence of conservedN-glycosylation sites in all the organic anion transporters cloned so far suggests that glycosylation may play an important role in the function of these proteins. A study using brush-border membrane vesicles from dog kidney (8Sokol P.P. Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7118-7123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implied that histidine residues may be important for organic anion transport. To elucidate the diversity of the substrate recognition by the organic anion transporters, a signal feature of the organic anion transport system, it is important to clarify the mechanisms involved in the interaction of the substrates with the essential residues such as histidine residues of mOAT. 1The abbreviations used are: mOAT, mouse kidney organic anion transporter; PAH, p-aminohippurate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; DTT, dithiothreitol. Because it is highly desirable to express mammalian transport proteins in a mammalian expression system to ensure the appropriate post-translational processing, in the present study we have pursued an alternative expression system in a mammalian cell line, COS-7 (9Gluzman Y. Cell. 1989; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). We showed that, when transfected with mOAT cDNA, the COS-7 cell system is functionally active as an organic anion transporter, and it exhibits similar general characteristics as described previously in other systems (4Sweet D.H. Wolff N.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30088-30095Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 5Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1987; 409: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We now show that PAH transport by mOAT can be inhibited by vitamins and a variety of anionic drugs. Here we provide the first evidence that glycosylation of mOAT is necessary for the proper trafficking of the transporter onto the plasma membrane. We also suggest that histidine residues may be important for the transport function. To evaluate the role of mOAT during kidney development, we have studied the expression of mOAT in the developing mouse kidney. Full-length cDNAs encoding mOAT with and without epitope tags, were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen). The epitope-tagged constructs encoded a fusion protein consisting of full-length mOAT with 10 amino acids of the human c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL, nucleotide GAACAAAAGCTGATTTCTGAAGAAGACCTG) at the carboxyl terminus. Tagged mOAT cDNA was synthesized by the polymerase chain reaction amplification. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into plasmid pcDNA3.1(−) at XbaI and HindIII sites. The sequence was confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method. COS-7 cells were grown in 24-well plates (50–80% confluency) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with either 0.25 μg/well of pcDNA3.1(−)-mOAT, pcDNA3.1(−)-mOAT-myc, or pcDNA3.1(−) using LipofectAmineTM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instruction. The transfection efficiency was ∼30% in all experiments as estimated by visualization by fluorescence microscopy after staining of mOAT-myc-transfected cells using anti-myc antibody in conjunction with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were used for transport measurements or immunostaining 48–72 h after transfection. For each well, uptake solution (140 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm Tris, pH 7, and 20 μm14C-labeled PAH) was added. At times indicated in the figure legends, the uptake was stopped by aspirating off the uptake solution and rapidly washing the plate with ice-cold washing solution (140 mm choline chloride, 2 mmKCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, and 5 mm Tris, pH 7). The cells were solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH and aliquoted for liquid scintillation counting. The protein concentration was determined using the Bradford dye-binding procedure (11Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). For the inhibition studies, PAH uptake was measured in the presence of 0.3 mm to ∼1 mm substrates as indicated. cRNA was synthesized from various pcDNA3.1(−) subclones using an in vitrotranscription kit (Stratagene). The cRNAs were then translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) withl-[35S]methionine (NEN Life Science Products) as described earlier (12You G. Smith C.P. Kanai Y. Lee W. Stelzner M. Hediger M.A Nature. 1993; 365: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega) were added to some of the translation reactions, which were then centrifuged at 4° C for 30 min in buffer containing 2.5% glycerol. SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 8 m urea, 20% sucrose, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue) was added to all of the translation reactions, which were then boiled for 5 min before SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 72 h after transfection, COS-7 cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed for 15 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and rewashed in PBS. The fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. After that, the cells were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in PBS containing 5% goat serum and then incubated for 1 h in the same medium containing anti-myc antibody (1:100) at room temperature. The cells were washed, and bound primary antibodies were detected by reaction with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Chemicon) diluted 1:100 for 1 h. Cells were thoroughly washed, and the cover glasses were mounted in 90% glycerol plus Citifluor. Samples were visualized on a fluorescence microscope. Developing mouse kidneys were collected, rinsed in PBS, and then fixed in ice-cold freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 1 h. They were then rinsed in 0.9% NaCl and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and embedded in paraffin. 7-μm sections were cut, mounted on slides, dewaxed, pretreated, and prehybridized as described previously (7Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G. Bush K.T. Barros E.J.G. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Antisense RNA probes labeled with [α-35S]UTP (Amersham) were produced. Hybridization was done overnight at 50 °C. Post-hybridization treatments were as follows: (i) two washes in 50% formamide, 2× SSC, 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (FSM) at 60 °C for 30 min, (ii) digestion with 10 μg/ml RNase A in 4× SSC, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 30 min, and (iii) two washes in FSM at 60 °C for 45 min. Slides were dipped in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion and exposed for 10 days, and photographs were taken using a Leica DMRB microscope. Our preliminary experiment showed that pcDNA3.1(−)-mOAT-transfected cells gave a linear uptake of14C-labeled PAH for 1 h (data not shown). The kinetics of PAH transport were studied using 10-min uptake points. The initial rate of PAH uptake over a wide range of PAH concentrations was determined (Fig. 1 a). Consistent with the previously reported data (4Sweet D.H. Wolff N.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30088-30095Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 5Sekine T. Watanabe N.

Physiol. 1987; 409: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the transport of PAH across the cell membrane was saturable (Fig. 1 b). Based on Eadie-Hofstee plot analysis (Fig. 1 b,inset), the K m value for PAH was 37.3 μm and V max was 210 pmol/mg/10 min. We examined the substrate specificity of the carrier in competition experiments. A representative experiment of the relative inhibition of PAH (20 μm) uptake by 0.3 mm to ∼1 mm substrates is shown in Fig.2. Because kidney is typically more efficient in the elimination of water-soluble compounds than liver, which is more efficient in the biliary disposal of liposoluble compounds (13Brenner B.M. 5th Ed. The Kidney. 8. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 608Google Scholar), we tested the inhibition effect of water-soluble vitamins on mOAT-induced PAH transport. Among the vitamins examined, riboflavin inhibited the mOAT-mediated PAH transport by 70%. Folic acid and pantothenic acid showed a moderate inhibition (about 50%). Ascorbic acid had no significant effect on the transport process (Fig.2 a). We also examined the inhibition effect of a series of anionic drugs that may have potential nephrotoxicity (Fig.2 b): nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin, sulindac, diclofenac, and carprofen almost completely blocked PAH transport. Anti-hypertensive drugs captopril and enalapril and anti-tumor drugs methotrexate and semustine showed moderate inhibition. However, lisinopril (anti-hypertensive drug) and cisplatin (anti-tumor drug) had little effect under our experimental condition. In our previous study (7Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G. Bush K.T. Barros E.J.G. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), we reported the presence of four potential glycosylation sites located in the first extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 of mOAT. To determine whether carbohydrate moieties play a role in the function of the protein, we carried out initial experiments using the general inhibitor of glycosylation, tunicamycin. When COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(−)-mOAT were pretreated with 10 μg/ml tunicamycin for 24 h, an almost complete inhibition in the transport activity was observed (Fig. 3 a). The potential use of these glycosylation sites was supported by ourin vitro translation data of mOAT cRNA using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system followed by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 b). The major mOAT translation product synthesized in the presence of microsomes is larger than the ∼58-kDa product synthesized in the absence of microsomes. The microsome-dependent shift in the size of the mOAT translation product was reversed by endoglycosidase H treatment, indicating that the decreased mobility observed after translation in the presence of microsomes is due to glycosylation. Next we investigated the reasons for a decrease in the transport activity with deglycosylation. Our strategy was to engineer an epitope tag (c-myc) to the carboxyl terminus of the protein so that the expressed protein could be detected using an anti-myc monoclonal antibody. To ensure that the epitope tag had little effect on the transport function, we measured the [14C]PAH uptake into both mOAT and mOAT-myc-transfected cells. As shown in Fig.4, both mOAT and mOAT-myc showed similar transport activity and were equally sensitive to the inhibitor, probenecid. The transport activities of both constructs were blocked to the same extent by treatment of 10 μg/ml tunicamycin, suggesting that the myc-tagged construct retains the functional properties of the native (unmodified) structure. Experiments were next carried out to examine the protein expression pattern of mOAT-myc before and after the treatment with tunicamycin using immunofluorescence. We showed that the plasma membrane was clearly labeled in the mOAT-transfected cells (Fig.5 a) as compared with control cells (Fig. 5 e). In contrast, fluorescence remained mainly in the intracellular compartment after tunicamycin treatment (Fig.5 c). The right panel (Fig. 5,b, d, and f) shows that cells were fully attached to the culture dishes under all conditions, suggesting that the level of tunicamycin used was not toxic to the cells. A previous study using brush-border membrane vesicles from dog kidney (8Sokol P.P. Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7118-7123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) implied that histidine residues may be important for organic anion transport. Therefore, the effect of the histidyl modifier, DEPC, on PAH transport was examined. Fig.6 a shows that 1 mmDEPC completely blocked mOAT-mediated PAH transport, and the presence of 100 μm unlabeled PAH is capable of providing significant protection (90%) against the inhibitory effect by DEPC. The specificity of DEPC was further investigated by examining transport after washing with a sulfhydryl restoring agent, dithiothreitol (DTT). If the sulfhydryl groups were modified by DEPC, then washing with DTT would result in restoration (14Lundblad R.L. Noyes C.M. Chemical Reagents for Protein Modification. 1. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1984: 105-125Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 a, treatment with DTT (10 mm) did not restore PAH transport after modification by DEPC. It is conceivable that tyrosine residues could have been modified by DEPC under the conditions employed (15Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Therefore, another approach to identify the group modified by DEPC was to examine what effect the tyrosine-directed reagent N-acetylimidazole had on PAH transport. As shown in Fig. 6 b, N-acetylimidazole (1 mm) had no effect on PAH transport. To study the maturation of the organic anion transport system in the developing kidney, mRNA localization in the kidneys of 1-day- and 1-week-old mice were studied using sense and antisense cRNA, and the data were compared with that of adult kidney. Fig.7 showed that the most intense signal was present in kidney cortex, following a pattern characteristic of proximal tubular localization. There was no detectable signal in the glomeruli (arrows), distal tubules, or medulla (G). This mRNA expression pattern was obvious at the time of birth and continued throughout development. The goal of this study was to extend our previous study on the functional characterization of mOAT and identification of elements important for its function. In this study, mOAT-transfected COS-7 cells were shown to be a valid model system for the functional analyses. The affinity (K m) for the protosubstrate PAH in COS-7 cells (∼37.3 μm) was comparable with theK m obtained from other systems (14∼80 μm) (4Sweet D.H. Wolff N.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30088-30095Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 5Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1987; 409: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that nephrotoxicity may be related to the elimination of certain drugs by organic anion transport system (16Bendayan R. Pharmacotherapy. 1996; 16: 971-985PubMed Google Scholar, 17Berndt W.O. Toxicol Pathol. 1998; 26: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore we examined a series of anionic drugs that may cause renal dysfunction (18Brenner B.M. 5th Ed. The Kidney. 8. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1996: 1680-1711Google Scholar) by examining their inhibitory effect on mOAT-mediated PAH transport. Our result showed that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin, sulindac, diclofenac, and carprofen almost completely blocked PAH transport. Anti-hypertensive drugs captopril and enalapril and anti-tumor drugs methotrexate and semustine showed moderate inhibition suggesting that renal clearance of these drugs may be through the organic anion transport system. Our previous study predicted that four potential N-linked glycosylation sites were located in an extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2. Glycosylation of one or more of these sites was suggested by our in vitro translation study (Fig.3 b). Furthermore, as demonstrated by the effect of tunicamycin on PAH uptake (Fig. 3 a), N-linked asparagine glycosylation appeared necessary for functional expression of the transporter. It has been suggested that the addition of oligosaccharides to proteins is an integral step in the proper sorting, translocation, and insertion of polypeptides into membranes (19Yusufi A.N.K. Szczepanska-Konkel M. Dousa T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13683-13691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosylation may also promote resistance to proteolytic attack (20Deas J. Erecinskam M. Brain Res. 1989; 483: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, tunicamycin, which is known to prevent the initial step in the glycosylation pathway, could potentially affect transport proteins by several mechanisms. Among the various possibilities, our immunofluorescence study suggested that glycosylation was necessary for proper targeting of mOAT to the plasma membrane. Modifications of the oligosaccharide structure of glycoproteins related to changes in the biological activity of transporter proteins have been described. The GLUT1 glucose transporter (21Feugeas J.P. Neel D. Pavia A.A. Laham A. Goussault Y. Derappe C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1030: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Asano T. Katagiri H. Takata K. Lin J.L. Ishihara H. Inukai K. Tsukuda K. Kikuchi M. Hirano H. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24632-24636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the organic cation transporter of renal brush-border membrane (23Ott R.T. Hui A.C. Giacomini K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are examples of such a correlation. However, glycosylation is not required for the transport activity of the serotonin transporter (24Tate C.G. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26303-26310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we provide the first evidence functionally, biochemically, and morphologically that glycosylation of mOAT is essential for the transport function. In our present study, we also examined the possible involvement of the cationic amino acid, histidine, in the normal function of the PAH transport carrier. Other studies have shown that histidine groups are involved in the normal function of a number of membrane transporters (8Sokol P.P. Holohan P.D. Ross C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7118-7123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Terada T. Saito H. Mukai M. Inui K.-I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The results from our studies with the histidine-specific reagent DEPC showed that this reagent caused a significant inhibition in the initial rate of PAH transport (Fig. 6 a). DEPC is considered to be a specific histidine reagent when used at a pH range of 5.5 to 7.5. At higher pH values, DEPC specificity, however, decreases, and the compound begins to interact with other groups such as thiol groups and tyrosine residues. Because our experiment was conducted at pH 7.0, it was reasonable to assume that DEPC was interacting with histidine residues in the PAH transporter. This conclusion was further supported by the finding that DTT was unable to restore DEPC-induced inactivation, and N-acetylimidazole, a highly specific tyrosine-modifying reagent, was incapable of inhibiting PAH transport. This argues against the possibility that DEPC was interacting with thiol groups and tyrosine residues (Fig. 6). Our result showing that the presence of substrate protected the transporter from DEPC inactivation suggested that histidine residue(s) may be close to the PAH binding sites. Further studies using site-directed mutagenesis of mOAT will provide additional information regarding the roles of histidine residues in substrate recognition by the organic anion transporters. Finally, early investigations suggested that the ability of the newborn kidney to eliminate organic anions is limited in comparison with the ability of an adult kidney (27Horster M. Lewy J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1970; 219: 1061-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 28Rennick B. Hamilton B. Evans R. Am. J. Physiol. 1961; 201: 743-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our in situhybridization study shows that mOAT mRNA was expressed in proximal tubules at the time of birth, and the same pattern was observed throughout development. The correlation of the transport activity and the mRNA expression needs to be examined further. In summary, our present study suggests that pcDNA3.1(−)-mOAT-transfected COS-7 cells can serve as an in vitro model system for studying the pharmacology and molecular biology of the cloned mOAT. Many drugs that can cause renal dysfunction, such as anti-tumor drugs, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are transported by the organic anion transport system. Therefore, our in vitro model system for screening drugs will facilitate the elucidation of the molecular basis of drug-related nephrotoxicity. Our study also presents data characterizing the impact of N-glycosylation and histidine residue(s) on the function of the cloned mOAT. The results contribute to our understanding of the relationship between structure and function of the organic anion transporters. We thank Dr. Sanjay K. Nigam for providing background information on this project. We also gratefully acknowledge Dr. Surendra Gupta for his support throughout this study."
https://openalex.org/W2088049733,"Poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) is an important regulator of gene expression that has been implicated in control of translation initiation. Here we report the isolation and the initial structural and functional characterization of the human PABP gene. Delineation of the promoter region revealed that it directs the initiation of transcription at consecutive C residues within a stretch of pyrimidines. A study of the translational behavior of the corresponding mRNA demonstrates that it is translationally repressed upon growth arrest of cultured mouse fibroblasts and translationally activated in regenerating rat liver. Furthermore, transfection experiments show that the first 32 nucleotides of PABP mRNA are sufficient to confer growth-dependent translational control on a heterologous mRNA. Substitution of the C residue at the cap site by purines abolishes the translational control of the chimeric mRNA. These features have established PABP mRNA as a new member of the terminal oligopyrimidine tract mRNA family. Members of this family are known to encode for components of the translational apparatus and to contain an oligopyrimidine tract at the 5′ terminus (5′TOP).

TOP mRNAs encode for various components of the translational apparatus, like ribosomal proteins (rp) and elongation factors 1α and 2 (EF1α and EF2). These mRNAs are candidates for growth-dependent translational control mediated through a translational cis-regulatory element. This approximately 30-nucleotide-long element is composed of a cytidine residue at the cap site followed by an uninterrupted stretch of up to 13 pyrimidines (13Meyuhas O. Avni D. Shama S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 363-384Google Scholar, 14Uetsuki T. Naito A. Nagata S. Kaziro Y. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Biberman Y. Meyuhas O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Growth-dependent translational control of an mRNA generally correlates with the presence of an oligopyrimidine stretch at its 5′ terminus. Yet, the linkage between these functional and structural features is not an absolute one. Thus, human β-tubulin mRNA is refractory to growth arrest in all of the examined cell lines, although it contains a bona fide translational cis-regulatory element including a 5′TOP, which is able to confer translational control on heterologous mRNA (18Avni D. Biberman Y. Meyuhas O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, the 6.0-kb transcript of insulin-like growth factor II is translationally regulated in a growth-dependent manner (19Nielsen F. Ostergaard L. Nielsen J. Christiansen J. Nature. 1995; 377: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), yet it does not contain a 5′TOP (20Raizis A. Eccles M. Reeve A. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In light of these exceptions, the structural basis for the translational control of PABP mRNA could not be unequivocally predicted. Moreover, the cumulative experience in assessing the regulatory role of 5′TOP motifs in the expression of various TOP genes has underscored the prerequisite to delimit the corresponding promoter regions (16Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 21Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P.

A. 1991; 88: 3319-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Hence, to establish the structural base for the translational behavior of PABP mRNA, we set out to clone and characterize the corresponding human gene. Our structural and functional analyses have established the transcription start site of PABP gene within a stretch of pyrimidine leading to the production of a TOP mRNA with an exceptionally long 5′-UTR. The translational efficiency of PABP mRNA tightly correlates with growth conditions of cultured fibroblasts as well as rat liver. The translational cis-regulatory element has been delimited to reside within the first 32 nucleotides of this mRNA and involves the 5′TOP motif. A human genomic library from W138 cell line of lung fibroblasts (Stratagene) was screened with a32P-labeled probe (1588-bp ScaI-EcoRI fragment) derived from the human PABP cDNA (24Grange T. de Sa C.M. Oddos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The initial screen of 2 × 105 plaques (one genome equivalence) yielded 33 positives, of which three different clones were isolated following a more stringent wash regime (0.3 m NaCl, 0.03 msodium acetate at 67 °C) in the second and third cycles of plaque purification. Restriction enzyme mapping and sequencing of the corresponding inserts established that one is pseudogene 1 and the other two are processed pseudogenes 2 and 3. Processed pseudogene 2 contains the entire sequence of PABP cDNA, whereas the nucleotide sequence determined in processed pseudogene 3 corresponds to positions 1941 to 2848 in this cDNA. Pseudogene 1 contains a sequence that corresponds to nucleotides 1357 to 1953 of PABP cDNA and is flanked by a nonrepetitive sequence. A second screen of 8 × 105 plaques of the same library was carried out using replicate Nytran filters (Schleicher & Schuell) with either a 263-bp EcoRI-StuI 5′-terminal region of PABP cDNA or a 200-bpXhoI-PstI fragment derived from a region flanking the PABP insert in pseudogene 1. Sixteen positive clones were isolated, and their DNAs were subjected to restriction enzyme digest and Southern blot hybridization with seven nonoverlapping probes spanning the entire PABP cDNA. Two overlapping phage clones were selected for further analysis: φE, which hybridized with 5′-end and mid-region probes, and φI, which hybridized with mid-region and 3′-end probes. After preliminary mapping with restriction enzymes, selected fragments were excised and subcloned into plasmid vectors. To determine the sequence of the promoter as well as exon-intron junctions, all exons were sequenced using primer walking. Upon identification of each exon-intron junction, a complementary primer was synthesized and used to sequence the opposite strand. Double-stranded plasmid DNA was sequenced either manually by the dideoxy method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, Ohio) or automatically by a DNA sequencer (ABI 377, Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, Ca). Determination of the transcription start site in hGH chimeric transcripts was carried out by primer extension as described previously (16Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were grown, transfected, and arrested as described (16Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Adult (6- to 8- week-old) male Sabra rats (Wistar origin) were obtained from the Hebrew University breeding center. Partial hepatectomy, resulting in the removal of 70% of the liver mass, was performed on male rats as described by Higgins and Anderson (26Higgins G.M. Anderson R.M. Arch. Pathol. 1931; 12: 186-202Google Scholar). Sham-operated rats were laparotomized, and their livers were manipulated but not excised. Harvesting and lysis of cells as well as size fractionation of polysomes by sedimentation through sucrose gradients were performed as described (27Meyuhas O. Biberman Y. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Amaldi F. Krieg P. A Laboratory Guide to RNA: Isolation, Analysis, and Synthesis. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1996: 65-81Google Scholar). When polysomal gradients were divided into two fractions (polysomal and the subpolysomal), RNA was extracted from each fraction by RNAzol B (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, Texas), according to the supplier's instructions, and the poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated as described (28Schibler U. Marcu K.B. Perry R.P. Cell. 1978; 15: 1495-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In all cases where sucrose gradients were divided into 12 fractions, RNA was extracted as described (28Schibler U. Marcu K.B. Perry R.P. Cell. 1978; 15: 1495-1509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and analyzed without further enrichment through a oligo(dT) column. RNA (Northern) blot analysis was performed as described (29Meyuhas O. Thompson A.E. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2691-2699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantification of the radioactive signals on the blots was carried out by BioImaging Analyzer (Fujix BAS 1000, Fuji, Japan). To assess the effectiveness of the growth arrest treatment and the selectivity of the effect on TOP mRNAs, we compared in each case (even if not shown) the polysomal association of a chimeric mRNA with that of endogenous rp mRNA and non-rp mRNA from the same polysomal gradient. Only experiments in which both these controls exhibited their typical translational behavior (repressed and unrepressed, respectively) were included. Standard protocols were used for all recombinant DNA technology (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pPABP-GH1 was constructed through the following steps. (i) An ∼1.0-kbp PstI fragment, spanning positions −378 to +635 of human PABP gene, was inserted into PstI site of pUC18 to yield pPABP-5′f. (ii) A 450-bp fragment was generated by PCR (31Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 3-12Google Scholar) using oligonucleotide primers pUC-1 (16Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and PABP-8 (CGGGATCC CACTCTCAGGACTAACC; boldface letters correspond to nucleotides +32 to +15 of PABP gene and are preceded by an underlined BamHI recognition site) and pPABP-5′f as a template. (iii) The PCR-generated fragment was cleaved byHindIII and BamHI. The resulting 410-bp fragment was cloned between the HindIII and BamHI sites of the promoter-less plasmid p0GH, which contains the hGH gene (32Selden R.F. Howie M.K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The resulting construct contains the hGH gene preceded by a human PABP sequence spanning positions −378 to +32. pPABP-GH2 was constructed through the following steps. (i) An ∼2.45-kbp filled-in NotI XbaI fragment, spanning positions −378 to +2070 of human PABP gene, was inserted between filled-in SalI site and SmaI site of pUC18 to yield pPABP-5′. (ii) pPABP-5′ was cut by StuI andEcoRI, leaving a PABP sequence spanning positions −378 to +265 linked to the plasmid. (iii) A 2.1-kbp BamHI (filled-in) EcoRI fragment containing the hGH gene from p0GH was inserted between StuI and EcoRI sites of pPABP-5′. pPABP-GH3 was constructed by inserting a 266-bp filled-inAvaI-BamHI fragment (derived from pPABP-GH1), which spans position −234 to +32 of the human PABP gene, inbetween filled-in SalI and BamHI sites of p0GH. pPABP-GH4 was constructed by inserting a 683-bpApaI-SacI (derived from pPABP-GH1) between filled-in SalI and SacI sites of p0GH. The GH in the resulting plasmid is preceded by the promoter region (positions −72 to +32) of human PABP gene. pPABP-GH5 was constructed by inserting a 864-bpHindII-trimmed (by T4 DNA polymerase)-BglI fragment (derived from pPABP-5′f (see above)), which spans positions −378 to +486 of the human PABP gene, inbetween HindII site and filled in SalI site of p0GH. pPABP-GH6 was constructed through the following steps. (i) A 217-bp fragment was generated by PCR using oligonucleotide primers hGH-3 (16Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and PABP-41 (GCTCTAGA GTGCGGCGCGGGGTAT; boldface letters correspond to nucleotides −43 to −28 of PABP gene and are preceded by an underlined XbaI recognition site) and pPABP-GH1 as a template. (ii) The PCR-generated fragment was made blunt-ended and then cleaved by BamHI, and the resulting 80-bp fragment was cloned between the HincII andBamHI sites of p0GH. The resulting construct contains the hGH gene preceded by a human PABP sequence spanning positions −43 to +32. The strategy used for the construction of pPABP-GH7 was similar to that described for pPABP-GH6 except for the usage of oligonucleotide PABP-42 (GCTCTAGA GCTCTTTCCTCCTGTT; boldface letters correspond to nucleotides −156 to −141 of PABP gene and are preceded by an underlined XbaI recognition site) instead of PABP-41. The resulting construct contains the hGH gene preceded by a human PABP sequence, spanning positions −156 to +32. pPABP-GH8 was constructed through the following steps. (i) An ∼440-bp fragment was generated by PCR using oligonucleotide primers pUC-1 (16Avni D. Shama S. Loreni F. Meyuhas O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3822-3833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and PABP-43 (CGGGATCC AAGCACCGCCTCCTGCA; boldface letters correspond to nucleotides −1 to −17 of PABP gene and are preceded by an underlined BamHI recognition site) and pPABP-GH1 as a template. (ii) The PCR-generated fragment was then cleaved by BamHI and HindIII, and the resulting 383-bp fragment was cloned between the HindIII andBamHI sites of p0GH. The resulting construct contains the hGH gene preceded by a human PABP sequence spanning positions −378 to −1. pPABP-GH11s and pPABP-GH11(as) were constructed by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides: PABP-47 (GATC CTTCTCCCCGGCGGTTAGTGCTGAGAGTGC; boldface letters correspond to nucleotides +3 to +33 of PABP gene) and PABP-48 (GATC GCACTCTCAGCACTAACCGCCGGGGAGAAGG; boldface letters correspond to nucleotides +34 to +4 of PABP gene. The underlined nucleotides correspond to the protruding ends ofBamHI site). The resulting double-stranded oligonucleotide was inserted into the BamHI site of PABP-GH8 in sense and antisense orientations, respectively. The structure of all constructs described here was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amount of growth hormone secreted by cells to the medium during the last 3 h of incubation was determined in an aliquot of the medium by radioimmunoassay with a commercial kit (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). The isolated fragment probes used in the Northern blot analysis were a 1.15-kb PstI fragment containing mouse α-actin cDNA (33Minty A.J. Caravatti M. Robert B. Cohen A. Daubas P. Weydert A. Gross F. Buckingham M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1008-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a 1.56-kbSacI-EcoRI fragment containing the 3′ half of human PABP cDNA (24Grange T. de Sa C.M. Oddos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), a 1.2-kb HindIII fragment containing rat albumin cDNA (34Kioussis D. Hamilton R.R.W.H. Tilghman S.M. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4370-4374Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), a 1.8-kb BglI fragment containing mouse EF1α cDNA (kindly provided by L. I. Slobin), and a 0.8-kb HindIII fragment containing hGH cDNA (kindly provided by T. Fogel, Bio-Technology General). A human genomic library in λ Fix vector was screened as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We isolated two overlapping clones, φE and φI (Fig.1 a), which collectively span an ∼25-kb region that encompasses the PABP gene. Restriction fragment mapping and Southern blot analysis of the phages and various subclones together with DNA sequencing of selected segments disclosed the complete organization of the PABP gene (Fig. 1 b). The gene consists of 15 exons totaling 2.86 kb and 14 introns covering about 22 kb. The sequences flanking the exon-intron junctions conform to the consensus for 5′ and 3′ splice sites (TableI).Table IOrganization of human PABP geneExon/IntronExon sizeSequences at Exon/Intron junctionsIntron sizeProtein interruptionRNA binding domain3′ Splice site5′ Splice sitebpkbpI/1698CCG GCG GAC Ggtgagcgccg4.8Ala-65RBD1II/2194ttcctgcaagCG GAG CGT GCT TCA TGT AAGgtaagccaaa0.2Lys-129/Val-130RBD 1+2III/3116ttttccctagGTG GTT TGT GAT CGC AAA GTgtaagttata2.2Val-168RBD 2IV/4140atcttattagA TTT GTT GGAGGC AAG TTT Ggtaatgtgtc2.5Gly-215RBD 2+3V/595aattttttagGG CCT GCC TTT GCA CAG AAAgtaagtggtc3.1Lys-246/Ala-247RBD 3VI/6138tggggggaagGCT GTG GAT GC AGA TAC CAGgttcattttt0.2Gln-292/Gly-293RBD 3+4VII/796ttctttttagGGT GTT AAT CT AGT GCA AAGgtaagaaaac1.2Lys-324/Val-325RBD 4VIII/8273tttttaatagGTT ATG ATG GT ATC CCA CAGgtaggtttta2.6Gln-415/Thr-416RBD 4IX/991ttccctgcagACT CAG AAC CA GAC CTC ATCgtgaagtctt2.1Pro-446/Phe-447X/10111taaaatgcagCAT TCC AAA ACAG CGT GTT Ggtgagtctta0.1Ala-483XI/11155tattttttagCT AAC ACA TCA ATG CAA CAGgtatggattt1.0Gln-534/Pro-535XII/1285ttctgtctagCCT GCT GTT CCAA ATG TTG Ggtgagtactt0.5Gly-563XIII/13131tgttccttagGT GAA CGG CTC CGT TCT AAGgtgatttaaa0.5Lys-606/Val-607XIV/1494ccttttttagGTT GAT GAA GACT GTT TAA Agtgagctttt1.0XV443acatttacagATTGATCAGGGExons and introns are designated by roman and arabic digits, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Exons and introns are designated by roman and arabic digits, respectively. Uppercase letters represent exonic sequences; lowercase letters represent intronic sequences. RBD, RNA binding domain. The entire exonic sequence is 12 nucleotides longer than that of the published cDNA sequence (24Grange T. de Sa C.M. Oddos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). This dissimilarity is part of several differences summarized in Table II, of which the major one is an insertion of 9 nucleotides leading to the addition of 3 amino acids (Lys-Phe-Gly) following amino acid residue 212 in the published sequence (24Grange T. de Sa C.M. Oddos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The sequence and the relative location of these three residues is identical to that found in mouse PABP protein and is similar to the corresponding sequence inXenopus laevis protein (Table II). The isolated human gene encodes for a protein that is identical in size to that deduced from the mouse cDNA and differ by only three conservative replacements: Lys to Arg, Glu to Asp, and Ser to Thr at positions 176, 259, and 576, respectively (35Wang M.-Y. Culter M. Karimpour I. Kleene K.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In light of the apparent evolutionary conservation of PABP amino acid sequence, it is conceivable that the missing three residues in the original report (24Grange T. de Sa C.M. Oddos J. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4771-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) is because of a sequencing error, whereas other differences might simply reflect polymorphism in the human population.Table IISequence diversity between human PABP cDNA and genePositionaThe coordinates refer to those published for the cDNA (accession number y00345).RegionNucleotides in cDNANucleotides in geneAmino acids cDNA/geneAmino acids in mouse (70)Amino acids in Xenopus (75)−1, −25′-UTRCC479∥480bThe sign ∥ depicts a site of insertion.5′-UTRG922CSCTTyr/TyrTyrTyr1137∥1138CSTTTGGCAAG-/LysPheGlyLysPheGlyLysTyrGly1775CSGAVal/IleIleIle24063′-UTRA2621∥26223′-UTRAaa, amino acids; CS, coding sequence.a The coordinates refer to those published for the cDNA (accession number y00345).b The sign ∥ depicts a site of insertion. Open table in a new tab aa, amino acids; CS, coding sequence. Interestingly, the PABP genes from Xenopus and human not only show a high degree of conservation of the amino acid sequence (93% of identical residues) but also an identical distribution of the four RNA binding domains among the different exons. Each of these functional domains are divided between two or three exons, which are the same exons in both species (Fig. 1 a and Ref. 36Nietfeld W. Mentzel H. Pieler T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3699-3705Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis of human PABP mRNA was carried out twice using lymphoblastoid cells. The extended DNA was electrophoresed on a sequencing gel alongside with sequencing reaction of either the cDNA clone or the pPABP-GH2. In both cases, they comigrated with nucleotides corresponding to position −2 and −1 with respect to the published sequence of human PABP cDNA (data not shown). Circumstantial evidence concerning the transcription start site has been obtained from sequence analysis of PABP processed pseudogene 2. This gene is flanked on both ends by direct repeats. It has been previously shown that in many cases the 5′ repeat is separated by one nucleotide from the established cap site (37Dudov K.P. Perry R.P. Cell. 1984; 37: 457-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 38Wiedemann L.M. Perry R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 2518-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Indeed, the 5′ repeat is located just three nucleotides upstream of the 5′-end of the cDNA (Fig. 2). Taken together, we have concluded that the transcription of PABP gene initiates at two consecutive C residues, and the resulting mRNA contains a 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract of 12 or 11 residues (Fig. 2). Like most other TOP mRNAs, the distal cap site is preceded by a few pyrimidine residues, and the entire pyrimidine tract is flanked by GC-rich sequences (13Meyuhas O. Avni D. Shama S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 363-384Google Scholar). It appears, therefore, that PABP mRNA is a bona fide TOP mRNA. The 3′-end of the PABP gene has been determined to reside at the nucleotide immediately preceding the poly(A) tail in both the PABP cDNA and the processed pseudogene 3 (Fig. 2). It should be noted that scanning of the promoter and the intronic as well as the 3′ flanking sequences of the human PABP gene against the EMBL data base has revealed significant homology with two ESTs. Thus, a sequence of the antisense strand within the promoter region (positions +98 to −205) show 94.3% homology with a rat ovary mRNA of unknown function (accession number AI176738). Similarly, a sequence of the antisense strand spanning the first 108 nucleotides of exon 15 and the last 132 nucleotides of intron 14 exhibits 96.6% homology with a human testis mRNA of unknown function (accession number AI140680). Conceivably, these sequences result from reverse transcription of PABP mRNA molecules derived by the rare usage of an alternative upstream transcription start site (AI176738) or of a splicing intermediate (AI140680). Conceivably, the 5′TOP identified in the PABP gene might explain the previous observation concerning growth-dependent translational control of PABP mRNA. However, examining this possibility is based on assessment of the translational efficiency of chimeric mRNAs containing the 5′TOP of PABP mRNA. Formation of an mRNA with an authentic PABP 5′TOP requires the construction of a chimeric gene containing PABP promoter and the first transcribed nucleotides of PABP gene followed by the sequence of a reporter gene. Previous such analyses of several other TOP genes have disclosed critical transcriptional regulatory elements within the first exon or even the first intron (21Hariharan N. Kelley D.E. Perry R.P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1789-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Hence, a prerequisite for functional analysis of the 5′TOP element is a functional characterization of the promoter region. To this end, we first sequenced the promoter region from position −378 (Fig. 3). PABP promoter includes a canonical TATAA box spanning positions −30 to −26. In that respect it is similar to the promoters of EF1α and EF2 genes but differs from those of most rp genes (13Meyuhas O. Avni D. Shama S. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 363-384Google Scholar). Next, we constructed various chimeras harboring the hGH gene preceded by sequences containing portions of various lengths of the 5′-flanking sequences and 5′-UTR of the PABP gene. These constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and their expression was assessed by monitoring both the relative abundance of the resulting transcripts and the amount of hGH secreted into the medium. Fig. 4 shows that the promoter activity was not affected when the 5′-flanking sequence was shortened from 378 to 234 nt (PABP-GH3). It was decreased about 2-fold when further shortened to 156 nt (PABP-GH7), dropped abruptly when it included just 72 nt (PABP-GH4), and was completely abolished when only 43 nt were left (PABP-GH6).

When activated by double-stranded RNA, these proteins polymerize ATP into 2′-5′-linked oligomers with the general formula pppA(2′p5′A)n, n ≥ 1. Three forms of human 2–5A synthetases have been described corresponding to proteins of 40/46 (p40/p46), 69/71 (p69/p71), and 100 kDa (p100). Here we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of p100. By screening a cDNA expression library with a specific p100 polyclonal antibody, we first isolated a 590-nucleotide cDNA fragment which was subsequently used to isolate the full-length 6365-nucleotide cDNA. This cDNA recognizes a distinct interferon-induced messenger RNA of 7 kilobases. It has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 1087 amino acids including the sequence of seven peptides obtained by microsequencing of the natural p100 protein, which was purified from interferon-treated human cells. p100 is composed of three adjacent domains, each homologous to the previously defined catalytic unit of 350 amino acids, which is present as one unit in p40/p46 and as two units in p69/p71. The recombinant p100 synthesized preferentially dimeric 2′,5′-oligoadenylate molecules and displayed parameters for maximum enzyme activity similar to the natural p100. These results confirm that the enzymatic activity of p100 is distinct compared with that of p40/p46 and p69/p71.

By screening a cDNA expression library with a specific p100 polyclonal antibody, we first isolated a 590-nucleotide cDNA fragment which was subsequently used to isolate the full-length 6365-nucleotide cDNA. This cDNA recognizes a distinct interferon-induced messenger RNA of 7 kilobases. It has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 1087 amino acids including the sequence of seven peptides obtained by microsequencing of the natural p100 protein, which was purified from interferon-treated human cells. p100 is composed of three adjacent domains, each homologous to the previously defined catalytic unit of 350 amino acids, which is present as one unit in p40/p46 and as two units in p69/p71. The recombinant p100 synthesized preferentially dimeric 2′,5′-oligoadenylate molecules and displayed parameters for maximum enzyme activity similar to the natural p100. These results confirm that the enzymatic activity of p100 is distinct compared with that of p40/p46 and p69/p71.

This mixture of oligonucleotides is referred to as 2–5A, and the enzymes that synthesize it are referred to under the generic term 2–5A synthetase (3Hovanessian A.G. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or as 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (2′,5′-OAS). Currently, the only known function of 2–5A is to bind and activate a latent endoribonuclease responsible for the degradation of viral and cellular RNAs (4Clemens M.J. Williams B.R.

Cell. 1993; 72: 753-765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). This leads to inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, thus impairing viral replication (for reviews see Refs. 6Lengyel P. Annu. Rev.

Virology. 1991; 183: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The action of 2–5A in cells is transient (9Hovanessian A.G. Wood J. Meurs E. Montagnier L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3261-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) because of a phosphodiesterase that cleaves preferentially 2′,5′-linked oligonucleotides (10Schmidt A. Chernajovsky Y. Shulman L. Federman P. Berissi H. Revel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4788-4792Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In vitro, the synthesis of 2–5A requires activation of the 2′,5′-OAS by double-stranded (ds) RNA or single-stranded RNA with a defined secondary structure, such as the 5′-untranslated region of all human immunodeficiency virus mRNAs that contains a stem-loop structure (11Marie I.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In intact cells or tissues, the 2′,5′-OAS can become activated during virus infections due to the presence of genomic viral dsRNA molecules, or as a result of the production of viral dsRNA replicative intermediates during virus replication (13Williams B.R.

Chem. 1982; 257: 14593-14596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2′,5′-OAS is present in most mammalian cells and tissues (15Stark G.R. Dower W.J. Schimke R.T. Brown R.E. Kerr I.M.

Natural occurrence of 2–5A has clearly been demonstrated in interferon-treated cells infected with EMCV (13Williams B.R. Golgher R.R. Brown R.E. Gilbert C.S. Kerr I.M. Nature. 1979; 282: 582-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and results from several laboratories have suggested that the 2–5A system (the OAS, 2–5A, and the endoribonuclease) plays a role, at least in part, in the mechanism of the antiviral and antiproliferative action of interferon (6Lengyel P.

Similarly, p69/p71 gathers two isoforms sharing a common amino terminus of 683 residues but with different carboxyl termini, probably generated by differential splicing (28Marie I. Hovanessian A.G.

The p40/p46 and p69/p71 are found to be associated with different subcellular fractions such as mitochondrial, nuclear, and rough/smooth microsomal fractions, whereas p100 is mainly associated with the ribosomal fraction (21Hovanessian A.G.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18601-18607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, consistent with this, this form of OAS has been found to be associated with the nuclear and plasma membranes (29Marie I.

In addition to the synthesis of 2–5A molecules, partially purified OAS preparations have been shown to catalyze in vitro the transfer of a nucleotide monophosphate moiety to the 2′-OH end of a preformed 2–5A molecule or to a nucleotide with the structure RpA like NAD+, Ap4A, and tRNA (35Ball L.

However, biological relevance of these latter modified nucleotides is not yet clear. Moreover, GTP could be an alternative substrate for OAS p69 or P100 to catalyze the 2′-5′ transfer of a GMP moiety to a GTP molecule other than to a nucleotide with the structure RpA (34Marie I. Blanco J. Rebouillat D. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 558-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This latter observation is in agreement with some reports suggesting a role for p100 in pre-messenger RNA splicing (39Sperling J. Chebath J. Arad-Dann H. Offen D. Spann P. Lehrer R. Goldblatt D. Jolles B. Sperling R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10377-10381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In this article, we purified p100 from interferon α-treated human Daudi cells, and after digestion with endo-lysine C the sequence of several peptides was obtained by microsequencing. In parallel, by using polyclonal antibodies specific to p100, we isolated a cDNA fragment corresponding to p100 by screening an expression cDNA library constructed with mRNAs from interferon-treated Daudi cells. The identity of this isolated cDNA as that of p100 was confirmed by the presence of the peptide sequences of the natural p100. Full-length cDNA encoding p100 was achieved by screening additional cDNA libraries and by RT-PCR approaches. The deduced amino acid sequence from this cDNA revealed its tripartite nature compared with the bipartite nature of p69/p71. Expression of the full-length cDNA generated a 100-kDa protein, which was recognized by polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against p100, and manifested enzymatic activity similar to the natural p100 from interferon-treated human cells.DISCUSSIONHere we describe the cloning and characterization of the full-length cDNA encoding the 100-kDa form of human 2′,5′-OAS (p100). This cDNA hybridizes to an interferon-induced 7-kb mRNA and encodes a protein that has an electrophoretic mobility similar to the natural p100 present in interferon-treated human cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of this cDNA contains the sequence of the seven peptides that were microsequenced from the purified p100, thus confirming the identity of the isolated cDNA. The identity between p100 and the recombinant protein produced by the expression of this cDNA was further demonstrated by positive reactivity with specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies raised against the 100-kDa form of 2′,5′-OAS. Furthermore, the recombinant protein manifested catalytic 2′,5′-OAS activity typical of the natural p100, i.e.catalyzing preferentially the synthesis of dimeric molecules of 2–5A. The recombinant protein also displayed parameters for maximum enzyme activity, such as pH optimum and activation by lower concentrations of dsRNA, similar to the natural p100.Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the three known human 2′,5′-OASs, p40/p46, p69/p71, and p100, reveals the presence of a conserved domain of about 350 amino acid residues (see Refs. 25Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Benech P. Merlin G. Revel M. Chebath J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and the results herein). The two isoforms of the middle-sized 2′,5′-OAS (p69/p71) share a common amino terminus of 683 residues composed of two highly homologous domains I and II, and which share 41 and 53% identity in amino acid sequence, respectively, with the first 346 amino acids common between the two isoforms of the small 2′,5′-OAS (p40/p46). The results presented here have demonstrated that p100 is composed of three adjacent domains that share 44–60% sequence similarity with each other, and each domain is homologous to the first 346 amino acids in p40/p46 (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). In view of the observation that the human OAS forms p40/p46, p69/p71, and p100 contain 1, 2, and 3 conserved OAS domains or units, respectively, we have proposed designating these three forms of related enzymes as OAS1 for p40/p46, OAS2 for p69/p71, and OAS3 for p100. Recently, we showed that the genes encoding the three forms of 2′,5′-OASs are clustered on chromosome 12q24.2 within a region of 130 kb, which represents the 2′,5′-OAS locus. They share the same orientation of transcription and are arranged in the order centromere–5′–OAS1–OAS3–OAS2–3′–telomere (41Hovnanian A. Rebouillat D. Mattei M.G. Levy E.R. Marié I. Monaco A.P. Hovanessian A.G. Genomics. 1998; 52: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The clustering of these genes, and the demonstration that the small, middle and large forms of 2′,5′-OAS contain increased numbers of the 2–5A functional unit, suggest their evolutionary relationship, possibly through the duplication of the conserved functional domain, i.e. the conserved OAS unit. The characterization of the events leading to the emergence of the 2′,5′-OAS family requires detailed studies on the exon-intron organization of these genes, with the aim to better understand their evolutionary relationship.Comparison of the sequence of p100 with international data banks like Swissprot revealed that this protein is homologous only to the previously cloned 2′,5′-OASs: human p40/p46 and p69/p71 and murine, rat, and chicken homologues of the small human 2′,5′-OAS (25Benech P. Mory Y. Revel M. Chebath J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2249-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Benech P. Merlin G. Revel M. Chebath J.

Recently, we and others have described the cloning of a cDNA encoding a 56-kDa protein (p56), which is highly homologous to the sequence of known 2′,5′-OASs (46Rebouillat D. Marié I. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 48Hartmann R. Stee Olsen H. Widder S. Jorgensen R. Justesen J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4121-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This interferon-induced p56 binds DNA and dsRNA, but is devoid of catalytic activity typical of the 2′,5′-OAS activity of p40/p46, p69/p71, and p100. Accordingly, this p56 was referred to as OAS-related protein, which might have as yet unidentified function(s) (46Rebouillat D. Marié I. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the gene of this OAS-related protein maps on chromosome 12q24.2, it is localized outside the 2′,5′-OAS locus containing p40/p46, p69/p71, and p100. 2A. Hovnanian, D. Rebouillat, E. R. Levy, M.-G. Mattéi, and A. G. Hovanessian, submitted for publication. The homology between the different domains of p69/p71 and p100, with the first 346 amino acids common in p40/p46, is discontinuous and is characterized by the presence of highly conserved stretches containing 7–14 amino acids (Fig. 3). These conserved motifs probably represent structural motifs essential for the 2′,5′-OAS catalytic activity of these proteins, such as the capacity to bind substrates ATP/GTP and to become activated by dsRNA. The conservation of these motifs in the two domains of p69/p71, and in the three domains of p100, is consistent with their implication as specific signatures of 2′,5′-OAS. The pentapeptide DFLK199Q in p40 has been reported to represent a part of the ATP binding site, lysine 199 inside this pentapeptide being essential for catalytic activity (50Kon N. Suhadolnik R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19983-19990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The sequences corresponding to the position of this pentapeptide in domains I, II, and III of p100 are NFVNI, NFMNI, and NFIII, respectively (Fig.1 B), and in domains I and II of p69/p71 are KFFDN and NFIRS, respectively (28Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, apart from the phenylalanine residues, no other amino acid residue is conserved in comparison with the DFLKD sequence of the potential ATP binding site. Consequently, the role of this sequence as an ATP binding domain is questionable. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that mutation of lysine 199 in the pentapeptide DFLK199Q in p40 generates an active enzyme when the mutant protein is expressed in insect cells but not when it is expressed inEscherichia coli (51Bandyopadhyay S. Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Sen G.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3824-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Thus, the mutant protein is generated as an active enzyme in higher eukaryotic cells, probably due to appropriate modifications or folding of p40.A critical characteristic of human 2′,5′-OAS is oligomerization. By gel filtration experiments, we have previously demonstrated that p40/p46 exist as tetramers, p69/p71 as dimers, and p100 as monomers. Recently, mutations in the tripeptide CFK in the murine analog of p40 have been reported to abolish the capacity of the enzyme to tetramerize along with loss of catalytic activity (52Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Guo W.D. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), thus pointing out that oligomerization of p40 OAS is essential for its enzymatic activity. In the p69/p71 sequence, such a tripeptide is conserved in domain II (position 668–671) but not in domain I (28Marie I. Hovanessian A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9933-9939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a situation that could be sufficient for the dimerization of p69/p71 OAS. Indeed, deletion of this conserved CFK motif in domain II of p69 results in enzyme inactivation and lack of dimerization (53Ghosh A. Sarkar S.N. Bandyopadhyay S. Sen G.C. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17 Suppl. 2: s51Google Scholar). Search for the CFK motif in p100 revealed that the amino acid sequences at the corresponding position in domains I, II, and III are CFL, CFL, and CCM, respectively (Fig. 1). Thus, the CFK motif is not conserved in p100, and consequently this difference could account for its lack of oligomerization. As p40/p46 and p69/p71 exist as tetramers and dimers and manifest common catalytic parameters, we have postulated that the 2′,5′-OAS activity requires the presence of four catalytic domains, which can be provided by four molecules of p40/p46 and two molecules of p69/p71. The presence of only three 2–5A domains in p100 and its lack of oligomerization could account for the differences observed when compared with the other two 2′,5′-OASs. Indeed, unlike p40/p46 and p69/p71, which synthesize preferentially higher oligomers of 2–5A, p100 preferentially catalyzes the synthesis of 2–5A dimers. Moreover, p100 is activated at lower concentrations of dsRNA compared with p40/p46 and p69/p71. Furthermore, pH optimum for the activation of p100 is 7.5, whereas that for the other forms is 6.5 (34Marie I. Blanco J. Rebouillat D. Hovanessian A.G. Eur. J.

The dimeric forms of 2–5A have a low affinity to bind and thus activate the RNase L. Consequently, dimeric forms of 2–5A, if functional, must have another mode of action compared with the oligomeric molecules. Interestingly, analogs of dimeric forms of 2–5A have been demonstrated to exert a negative impact on the transcription profile in breast carcinoma cells (62Latham K.E. Cosenza S. Reichenbach N.L. Mordechai E. Adelson M.E. Kon N. Horvath S.E. Charubala R. Mikhailov S.N. Pfeiderer W. Suhadolnik R.J. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 827-837PubMed Google Scholar), a result that is consistent with earlier reports showing that low concentrations of 2–5A can regulate gene expression and DNA replication by virtue of a direct inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I (49Castora F.J. Erickson C.E. Kovacs T. Lesiak K. Torrence P.F. J. Interferon Res. 1991; 11: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Here we have confirmed that p100 synthesizes preferentially dimeric forms of 2–5A. This latter result and the induction of p100 by interferon raise the possibility of the implication of p100 in the overall mechanism of action of interferon, i.e. in functions outside the scope of the RNase L. The availability of the full-length cDNA encoding p100 will be invaluable in the further analysis of the role of this distinct 2′,5′-OAS.

Biotin is an essential coenzyme that has biological activity only when covalently attached to a class of important metabolic enzymes, the biotin carboxylases and decarboxylases (1Samols D.

Biochem. 1989; 58: 195-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Biotin is attached via an amide linkage to a specific lysine residue of the cognate protein, and this reaction is catalyzed by biotin protein ligase (BPL, 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; BPL, biotin protein ligase [EC 6.3.4.10]; CAPS, cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; IPTG, isopropylthiogalactoside; MOPS, morpholinepropanesulfonate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside; kb, kilobase pair. 1The abbreviations used are: ACP, acyl carrier protein; BCCP, biotin carboxyl carrier protein; BPL, biotin protein ligase [EC 6.3.4.10]; CAPS, cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonate; DTT, dithiothreitol; IPTG, isopropylthiogalactoside; MOPS, morpholinepropanesulfonate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside; kb, kilobase pair. also known as holocarboxylase synthetase) in two-step Reaction 1 as follows. Step1:Biotin+ATP⇌biotinoyl­AMP+PPi Step2:Biotinoyl­AMP+apoprotein→biotinoyl­protein+AMPReaction 1 This is a post-translational modification of extraordinary specificity. For example BPL recognizes just one of the >4000 different protein species of Escherichia coli, the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP), and quantitatively attaches biotin to a specific lysine residue of this protein. BCCP is one of the four protein species that comprise acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2), the enzyme catalyzing the first committed step of fatty acid biosynthesis, the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA (3Li S.-J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylation is a relatively rare post-translational modification throughout biology, with between one and five biotinylated protein species found in different organisms (4Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of both the BPLs and biotin acceptor protein domains are highly conserved. Moreover, this conservation applies to ligase-domain interactions, since biotinylation occurs when enzyme and protein substrate are derived from widely divergent species (4Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cronan Jr., J.E. Wallace J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 130: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6McAllister H.C.

Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), giving essentially identical structures. The protein forms a β-barrel structure, with the biotinyl-lysine exposed on a tight β-turn within the conserved Ala-Met-Lys-Met biotinylation motif. The BCCP biotin domain adopts a fold similar to those of several lipoyl domains (9Dardel F. Davis A.L. Laue E.D. Perham R.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Pares S. Cohen-Addad C. Seiker L. Neuburger M. Douce R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 248: 328-343PubMed Google Scholar) which undergo an analogous post-translational modification. The lipoyl cofactor is covalently attached to a specific lysine residue within a highly conserved Asp-Lys-Ala motif by lipoyl ligase via an ATP-activated intermediate (12Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan Jr., J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structure of the unbiotinylated (apo) form of the BCCP biotin domain determined by NMR (14Yao X. Wei D. Soden C. Summers M.F. Beckett D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15089-15100Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)2 is very similar to that of the holoprotein, with both forms of the protein having the same basic fold and some localized small differences. However, we have demonstrated recently that there is a subtle, global alteration in the structure of the domain accompanying biotinylation which can be detected by proteolysis and chemical modification (15Chapman-Smith A. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26017-26022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that these techniques, probably as a consequence of their irreversible nature, are a very sensitive indicator of changes in protein dynamics (16Fontana A. Zambonin M. Polverino de Laureto P. De Philippis V. Clementi A. Scaramella E. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The biotin-accepting domain of BCCP undergoes a complex series of protein-protein interactions, since it must interact with BPL to become functional and then with both the carboxylase and carboxyltransferase active sites of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex. The precise structural elements within the biotin domain that direct post-translational modification of the specific lysine are unknown. Several studies have shown that the nature of the flanking methionine residues, although not essential for biotinylation, does have an effect on the efficiency of the reaction. Substitution of the Met-Lys-Met sequence with the Asp-Lys-Ala lipoylation motif abolishes biotinylation, and changing either of the Met residues to Lys significantly reduces the extent of modification (17Reche P. Li Y.-L. Fuller C. Eichorn K. Perham R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, more conservative substitutions of the flanking methionines have little adverse effect on biotinylation (18Shenoy B.C. Paranjape S. Murtif V.L. Kumar G.K. Samols D. Wood H.G. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2505-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 19Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but do effect the carboxylation and carboxyl transfer reactions ofPropionibacterium shermanii transcarboxylase (20Shenoy B.C. Xie Y. Park V.L. Kumar G.K. Beegen H. Wood H.G. Samols D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18407-18412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extent to which truncated forms of biotin carrier proteins are biotinylated indicates that a minimum of 35–40 residues on either side of the biotin attachment site is necessary to specify biotinylation (3Li S.-J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,4Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is now evident that further truncation, which abolishes biotinylation, removes residues that contribute to the formation of the hydrophobic core of the folded structure (8Athappily F.K. Hendrickson W.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 1407-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that BPL recognizes the Met-Lys-Met motif within the context of a folded protein (21Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11425-11428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, mutant proteins that fold improperly are expected to be poor biotin acceptors. Indeed, amino acid substitutions at one of the several highly conserved glycine residues, or within the conserved Pro-X-X-Gly motif found N-terminal to the biotin attachment site, severely reduce the efficiency of biotinylation of the biotin domain from human propionyl-CoA carboxylase in E. coli (19Leon-Del-Rio A. Gravel R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22964-22968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, many of these substitutions, especially those of the Gly residues, would be expected to destabilize the structure of the domain and thus the poor biotinylation could well be a secondary consequence of the altered structure rather than a specific defect in recognition by BPL. Such structural alterations cannot be readily detected in vivo. In order to identify recognition determinants within the folded domain, we have addressed the problem of structural alteration introduced by amino acid substitution. We used localized mutagenesis of the C-terminal 87 residues of the E. coli BCCP biotin domain (BCCP87) coupled with a genetic selection to identify regions of the domain that are candidates for a role in biotin domain-BPL interactions. We purified several of these mutant biotin domain proteins that showed reduced biotinylation in vivo and have characterized the defect in vitro. This approach has allowed us to distinguish putative BPL interaction mutations from structurally defective proteins. Generalized transduction with P1vir and bacterial matings were carried out as described by Miller (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

Bacteriol. 1981; 148: 926-932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tetracycline-resistant transductants were screened for β-alanine-dependent growth on minimal E glucose solid media, and one such auxotroph was saved as TM1 (panD2 zad220::Tn10). ThelacI q plasmid pMS421 (25Keating D.H. Carey M.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22229-22235Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was inserted into strain TM1 to give TM5. The F′ factor from strain XL1-Blue was transferred by conjugation into tetracycline-sensitive derivatives of TM1 (selected by the method of Maloy and Nunn (26Maloy S.R. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1110-1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), with selection for tetracycline resistance and counterselection for streptomycin resistance, to give strain TM21 (F′(proAB lacI q M15 Tn10) panD2). Culture media contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 30 μg/ml streptomycin, or 30 μg/ml spectinomycin, as appropriate. Nucleic acid manipulations were carried out using standard techniques (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in pTZ18U (29Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). TheEcoRI-ClaI ACP fragment and the 0.3-kbNcoI-SstII BCCP fragment were sequentially inserted into polylinker sites of the cloning vector pMTL21 (30Chambers S.P. Prior D.A. Barstow D.A. Minton N.P. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 68: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) followed by enzymatic manipulation of the polylinker sequences in order to place the ACP and BCCP gene fragments into the same translational reading frame. The DNA encoding the fusion protein consists of the sequence encoding the first 70 residues of ACP linked by the sequence 5′-CGACGTCACGCGCGCGTC-3′ (encoding the linker peptide, DVTRAS) to the sequence encoding the last 87 residues of BCCP. The hybrid gene was obtained by EcoRI-PstI digestion and inserted into the expression vector pKK223-3 (31Brosius J. Holy A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This plasmid was propagated in lacI qstrains to allow inducible expression from the tac promoter. Plasmid pTM4E was constructed by introducing the f1 origin of replication derived from pUC1813, via pCY50, 3J. Cronan, unpublished results. into pTM4D. BCCP biotin domain variants expressing single amino acid substitutions were produced by ligating appropriate restriction fragments from mutagenized pTM4E derivatives into plasmid pTM53, which encodes the C-terminal 87 residues of BCCP (BCCP87) under the control of the T7 promoter (32Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 881-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Restriction fragments isolated from separate ScaI or NcoI plus SstII digests of pTM4E (6.7 and 6.4 kb, respectively) were annealed as described by Kalderon et al. (see Ref. 33Kalderon D. Oostra B.A. Ely B.K. Smith A.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5161-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar; with the addition of 1.0 m NaCl to the annealing buffer) to produce gapped heteroduplexes with 0.3-kb single-stranded loops. These heteroduplexes were subjected to localized mutagenesis by treatment with 1.0m methoxylamine hydrochloride for 3–60 min essentially as described (34Kadonga J.T. Knowles J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Grabau C. Chang Y.-Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12510-12519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After removal of methoxylamine and ethanol precipitation, the treated DNA was transformed directly into TM21, with selection for ampicillin resistance on rich broth plates. The resulting colonies were then screened for production of the ACP-BCCP fusion by scoring growth on MacConkey lactose medium. The lactose induces high level expression of the gene encoding the fusion protein. If the fusion protein is produced and stable, induction will result in growth inhibition due to titration of biotin ligase and the intrinsic toxicity of ACP overproduction (25Keating D.H. Carey M.R. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22229-22235Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Strains sensitive to lactose were then screened for derepression of bio operon expression (see below), and the remaining candidates were assayed for production of the full-length fusion protein and biotinylation by radioactive labelingin vivo (see below). Strains of interest were scored by a radial streak assay in which single colonies were suspended in 0.5 ml of medium E and then streaked outward from the center of minimal E plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactoside (X-gal; 80 μg/ml) and lacking biotin. A filter paper disc in the center of the plate was then spotted with 20 μl of 500 μm biotin. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, bio-lacZderepression resulted in a sharp blue/white interface near the outer edge of each growth streak. The distance between this interface and the biotin-saturated disc was taken as an indicator of biotin consumption. For quantitative assessment of derepression, the β-galactosidase activity of liquid cultures was measured as described by Miller (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 201-205Google Scholar), with cells disrupted with SDS and chloroform. Growth experiments requiring minimal media were carried out in medium E (36Davis R.W. Botstein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980: 202Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.4% glucose, 1 μg/ml thiamine, 0.1% vitamin-free casamino acids, and the indicated concentrations of biotin and β-alanine. For labeling BCCP or ACP in the fusion proteins, these media contained either 75–200 nm [3H]biotin (1 μCi/ml) and 10 μm β-alanine or 2–5 μm [3H]β-alanine (3–25 μCi/ml) and 100–200 nm biotin, respectively. After growth overnight in 0.2 ml of 3H-containing media, cells were subcultured into 1.0 ml of fresh 3H media, and fusion protein production was induced by the addition of isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG) to 1 mm. Whole cell lysates were prepared for SDS-PAGE essentially as described by Chapman-Smith et al. (32Chapman-Smith A. Turner D.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. Morris T.W. Wallace J.C. Biochem.

Sample loading was normalized by optical density measurements prior to electrophoresis. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 10% methanol, treated with Enlightening (NEN Life Science Products) for 30 min, dried under vacuum, and exposed to preflashed x-ray film at 70 °C.

Preliminary experiments showed that trypsin retained activity in the presence of 1 mm DTT using apoBCCP87 as a substrate, whereas 10 mm DTT inhibited the activity 3–4-fold (data not shown). BPL activity was measured by following incorporation of [3H]biotin into acid-precipitable material over time, with either wild type apoBCCP87 or the mutant apoproteins as the biotin acceptor. Unless otherwise stated, the assays contained 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 3 mm ATP, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 5 μm biotin, 5 pmol of [3H]biotin (specific activity 35–44 Ci/mmol), 100 mm KCl, 1.4 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin carrier protein, and the indicated concentrations of apoprotein in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was initiated by addition of purified E. coli biotin ligase (BirA; the gift of Dr. Dorothy Beckett) to a final concentration of 12.5 nm and incubated at 37 °C for up to 30 min, during which time the reaction was linear at saturating substrate concentrations. Aliquots taken at various time intervals were spotted onto dry 2 × 2-cm squares of Whatman 3MM paper to which 100 μl of 5 mm biotin and 100 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid had previously been applied. The pretreatment with trichloroacetic acid was found to be necessary to prevent the reaction continuing on the filter. After air-drying, the filters were washed batchwise twice in ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and once in ethanol, dried, and the acid-insoluble radioactivity measured. The optimal pH for activity was determined in assays over a pH range 4.5–11.0, with the following buffer systems at 40 mm: sodium acetate, pH 4.5–5.5, sodium phosphate, pH 6.0–7.5, sodium MOPS, pH 6.0–8.0, Tris-HCl, pH 7.0–9.5, and sodium CAPS, pH 9.0–11.0. For analysis of kinetic experiments, the maximum amount of added [3H]biotin that could be fixed by the enzyme was determined from a reaction with 0.25 μm enzyme (since [3H]biotin had a 3-fold lower counting efficiency on the filter paper when not bound to protein). In some experiments, to obtain sufficiently high levels of radioactivity for accurate detection, it was necessary to allow the reaction to continue until greater than 10% of the limiting substrate had been utilized. In this case the data were transformed for altering substrate concentration by the method of Lee and Wilson (37Lee H.-J. Wilson I.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 242: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and plotted as transformed values s′ andv′. Values for K m andV max were determined by fitting a plot of substrate concentration against rate directly to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism for MacIntosh (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). In cases where a reasonable estimate ofV max could not be obtained due to practical limitations to the substrate concentration range, constants were determined by linear regression with data in double-reciprocal form using GraphPad Prism. In order to isolate mutant biotin domains deficient in biotinylation in vivo, we constructed protein fusions to the BCCP biotin domain that could be detected using a straightforward assay that did not depend on biotinylation (Fig. 1 A). Acyl carrier protein (ACP) from E. coli was chosen as the N-terminal reporter group for the fusions because it is small (77 amino acids), stable, and can be specifically labeled (through its covalently linked 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group) with [3H]β-alanine (38Rock C.O. Cronan Jr., J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 362-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The ACP-BCCP fusion plasmid pTM4D encoded the 70 N-terminal residues of ACP followed by a short artificial linker and then the C-terminal 87 residues of BCCP (BCCP87). BCCP87 was chosen as the fusion sequence because fusion proteins that encoded only the last 55 or 67 residues of BCCP were not biotinylatedin vivo (39.Morris, T. W., Lipoate-protein and Biotin-protein Ligases of Escherichia coli.Ph.D. thesis, 1994, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL.Google Scholar). The lacI q host strains TM5 and TM21 required both biotin and β-alanine for growth which allowed efficient labeling and detection of the expressed fusion proteins. When expressed in the presence of [3H]biotin or [3H]β-alanine and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (“Experimental Procedures”), the ACP-BCCP fusion was efficiently and specifically labeled with both radioactive compounds (Fig. 1 B), indicating that both components were properly recognized by their cognate modification enzymes (BPL and holo-ACP synthase). Moreover, the native forms of both modified proteins were also present thus providing internal standards for the labeling reactions and gel electrophoresis. The fusion protein was stable in vivo, as judged by the high yields of labeled material and the lack of detectable proteolysis products. Our genetic selection for mutant fusion proteins deficient in biotinylation was based on the observation that basal expression of the ACP-BCCP hybrid gene of pTM4D increased the minimal concentration of biotin required for growth of strains blocked in biotin synthesis (bio strains). For growth in both liquid and solid minimal media (“Experimental Procedures”), bio strains harboring plasmid pTM4D required about 20 nm exogenous biotin, whereas strains carrying the vector plasmid (or no plasmid) grew readily on media containing about 1 nm biotin (data not shown). Mutagenesis was localized to the BCCP-coding sequence by use of a mutagen specific to single-stranded DNA and gapped heteroduplexes in which only the BCCP DNA was single-stranded. Plasmid pTM4E DNA with 0.3-kb single-stranded loops containing the BCCP87 coding sequence (“Experimental Procedures”) was treated in vitro with methoxylamine, and the mutagenized DNA was rapidly purified and transformed directly into strain TM21 with selection for ampicillin resistance on RB plates (“Experimental Procedures”). This initial selection step was based on the increased biotin requirements of bio-lacZ hosts harboring plasmid pTM4D mentioned above. The biotin content of RB medium is only ∼5 nm (determined by bioassay on strain SA291 using the disc assay method of del Capillo-Campbell et al. (40del Capillo-Campbell A. Dykhuizen D. Cleory P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)). Thus, strains carrying mutant plasmids that encoded fusion proteins that were poorly biotinylated would be expected to form colonies on RB medium since the defect in biotinylation would relieve the requirement for higher biotin concentrations (Fig. 2). In order to further sort these candidate colonies (and eliminate molecular siblings), each colony was then screened for its ability to repress thebio-lacZ reporter in a biotin-dependent manner using a radial streak assay (“Experimental Procedures”). This screen is based on the sophisticated regulatory system that controls biotin synthesis in E. coli. The BPL of E. colifunctions not only as an enzyme but as the repressor regulating transcription of the biotin biosynthetic gene operon. E. coli BPL binds to the biotin operon operator only when complexed with biotinoyl-AMP, the product of the first half-reaction, whereas protein biotinylation consumes the biotinoyl-AMP and thus acts as an antagonist of DNA binding (4Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10332-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, overproduction of a biotin acceptor protein results in derepression of biotin operon transcription which in the present case is readily assayed by β-galactosidase production from the lacZ gene inserted into the biotin operon of the host strain chromosome (Fig. 2). (Thebio mutation in these strains results from insertion of a promoter-less lacZ gene into the biotin operon such that thebioF gene is disrupted and the bio promoter drives the synthesis of β-galactosidase). As expected from prior studies using a different biotin acceptor protein (4Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10327-10333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Cronan Jr., J.E. J.

Because palmitate is not attached without prior farnesyl addition, the distinct contributions of the two lipid modifications to membrane attachment or biological activity have been difficult to examine. To test if palmitate is able to support these crucial functions on its own, novel C-terminal mutants of Ha-Ras were constructed, retaining the natural sites for palmitoylation, but replacing the C-terminal residue of the CAAX signal for prenylation with six lysines. Both the Ext61L and ExtWT proteins were modified in a dynamic fashion by palmitate, without being farnesylated; bound to membranes modestly (40% as well as native Ha-Ras); and retained appropriate GTP binding properties. Ext61L caused potent transformation of NIH 3T3 cells and, unexpectedly, an exaggerated differentiation of PC12 cells. Ext61L with the six lysines but lacking palmitates was inactive. Thus, farnesyl is not needed as a signal for palmitate attachment or removal, and a combination of transient palmitate modification and basic residues can support Ha-Ras membrane binding and two quite different biological functions. The roles of palmitate can therefore be independent of and distinct from those of farnesyl. Reciprocally, if membrane association can be sustained largely through palmitates, farnesyl is freed to interact with other proteins. Ha-Ras undergoes post-translational modifications (including attachment of farnesyl and palmitate) that culminate in localization of the protein to the plasma membrane.

The roles of palmitate can therefore be independent of and distinct from those of farnesyl. Reciprocally, if membrane association can be sustained largely through palmitates, farnesyl is freed to interact with other proteins. In its GTP-bound conformation, Ha-Ras activates several signal transduction cascades that control gene expression and actin cytoskeleton organization. The most well studied of these pathways, the Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, involves a series of cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases; another utilizes several members of the Rho family of GTP-binding proteins that regulate cell morphology. In NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblast cells, activated forms of Ha-Ras induce mitogenesis and transformation; in the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12, Ha-Ras activation triggers neuronal differentiation. More important, membrane localization of Ha-Ras is critical for either of these distinct biological activities. One important consequence of membrane binding is to enable Ha-Ras to act as a GTP-dependent, membrane-localized docking site for effector proteins, such as Raf kinase. The correct targeting of Ha-Ras to the inner surface of the plasma membrane requires a series of post-translational modifications at the protein's C terminus. These reactions include attachment of the isoprenoid farnesyl to a cysteine residue (Cys-186) located four residues from the C terminus, followed by removal of the C-terminal tripeptide and methylation of the newly exposed carboxyl group of the farnesylated cysteine (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). The final step is palmitoylation of two nearby C-terminal cysteines (Cys-181 and Cys-184) (2Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 3Buss J.E. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The duties of these lipids has been inferred principally from mutant Ras proteins that lack the palmitates, but retain the isoprenoid, or that lack all three lipids entirely. The decreased membrane binding observed with these modification mutants has led to the model that membrane binding is a primary role for the lipids attached to Ha-Ras. However, the function(s) of farnesyl and palmitate, individually, have not been completely elucidated. The consequences of farnesyl attachment are particularly important because prenylation is the first step in processing, putting farnesylation in temporal control of subsequent modifications. Without an isoprenoid attached to Cys-186, the Ha-Ras protein remains soluble, and the adjacent Cys-181 and Cys-184 do not become palmitoylated. An isoprenoid has been shown to be a prerequisite modification for recognition by both the membrane-bound protease and methylase enzymes, which further modify the C terminus (4Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V.

Biochem. 1992; 61: 355-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a putative palmitoyl acyltransferase may also require the presence of a farnesyl group (6Liu L. Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23269-23276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but the authenticity of this enzymatic activity has not been confirmed. Farnesyl thus functions in maturation of Ras proteins by acting as part of a signal sequence for and allowing interaction of Ras with at least two membrane-bound processing enzymes. The most well recognized role for farnesyl is its participation in Ras membrane binding. Prenylation is required for initiating the transition of the cytosolic precursor to the membrane-bound form. Whether farnesyl also plays a role in sustaining or directing submembrane localization has not been clarified. Farnesyl by itself does not confer high affinity membrane binding to Ras peptides in vitro (7Schroeder H. Leventis R. Rex S. Schelhaas M. Nagele E. Waldmann H. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 30: 13102-13109Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Ghomashchi F. Zhang X. Liu L. Gelb M.H.

Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 11Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E.

Hartman G.D. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9141-9145Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The farnesyl group appears to depend heavily on a second mechanism to assist its efforts in membrane binding. Two types of “secondary” membrane-binding signals have been identified: a hydrophobic type involving palmitoylation of nearby cysteine residues, as is found in Ha-Ras, N-Ras, and Ki-Ras4A; and an ionic type, based on the series of basic residues just N-terminal of the CAAXsequence, as found in Ki-Ras4B (2Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar, 13Jackson J.H. Li J.W. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Cochrane C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12730-12734Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A number of studies have now suggested that farnesyl may have an additional role besides initiating membrane attachment. The farnesyl group is proposed to bind to specific membrane proteins (14Siddiqui A.A. Garland J.R. Dalton M.B. Sinensky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3712-3717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a process that might enhance Ras/membrane interaction or that might be needed for activation of Ras effector proteins. Good evidence has been presented that a structural or conformational epitope found in the prenylated form of Ha-Ras is important (in addition to the role of Ras in Raf membrane targeting) for activation of Raf-1 through the kinase's cysteine-rich zinc finger domain (15Luo Z. Diaz B. Marshall M.S. Avruch J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 16Roy S. Lane A. Yan J. McPherson R. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30274-30277Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In vitro analysis has suggested that farnesylation of Ha-Ras may also be needed for human SOS1 to promote guanine nucleotide exchange (18Porfiri E. Evans T. Chardin P. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22672-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies using an activated yeast Ras2 protein revealed that mutation of the farnesylation site decreased the interaction between Ras2 and adenylyl cyclase (19Bhattacharya S. Chen L. Broach J.R. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 20Kuroda Y. Noburu S. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies imply that the prenyl structure of Ras may be involved in and perhaps required for specific associations of Ha-Ras and its regulatory or target proteins. How potential roles in both lipid bilayer binding and protein interactions can be performed simultaneously or sequentially remains an important, unanswered question. The duties for which the palmitates of Ha-Ras are used are much less clear. Palmitate certainly has sufficient hydrophobicity to support membrane binding of an Ha-Ras protein, but the requirement for prior farnesylation has prevented study of the role(s) of the Ha-Ras palmitates independent of isoprenoid. It is possible that palmitoylation of Cys-181 and Cys-184 of Ha-Ras is only a nonspecific (although required) secondary membrane attachment signal that simply enables more substantial or sustained levels of membrane binding of a farnesylated Ha-Ras protein. More direct, biochemical studies of palmitoylation have been thwarted because the enzymes that might attach palmitates to Ha-Ras, or similar proteins, have proved to be extremely difficult to isolate (6Liu L. Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23269-23276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Dunphy J.T. Greentree W.K. Manahan C.L. Linder M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22399-22405Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In vivo requirements for palmitate attachment have been examined in a large series of C-terminal mutant Ha-Ras proteins, all of which became palmitoylated (11Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar). These studies identified amino acids that appeared to be novel signals for intracellular trafficking, but no consensus sequence for palmitate attachment was found. However, these mutant proteins still retained an intact CAAX motif and were farnesylated, so it remained possible that farnesyl might be part of an otherwise enigmatic signal for palmitoylation. Because several of these farnesylated and palmitoylated mutant Ha-Ras proteins were mis-localized to internal membranes within the cell, one clear result was that acquisition of both C-terminal lipids is not sufficient to assure correct plasma membrane targeting. However, based on observations that C181S/C184S mutants of Ha-Ras (which retain farnesyl but lack palmitate) localize poorly to the plasma membrane, several studies have suggested that it is palmitate rather than farnesyl that is largely responsible for Ha-Ras membrane binding. In the Xenopus oocyte maturation assay and also in transformation of NIH 3T3 cells, Ha-Ras proteins modified only by farnesyl have poor biological activity, indicating that acquisition of palmitates is important functionally (9Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11541-11547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J.

Using a yeast plasmid-loss assay, Mitchell et al. (25Mitchell D.A. Farh L. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21540-21546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) studied a series of yeast Ras2 proteins that showed that the combined effect of C-terminal basic amino acids and palmitoylation of cysteine residues was sufficient to support Ras-dependent growth, independent of prenylation. More important, the biological function of these yeast Ras2 proteins correlated with their ability to be palmitoylated. These results show that palmitate is an important contributor to Ha-Ras membrane binding and function and imply that, despite its chronological precedence, farnesyl depends upon palmitate to support these activities. However, it remains unclear whether palmitate mutually requires the farnesyl or plays an independent but complementary role in specific membrane association and biological activity of Ha-Ras. To enable study of requirements for palmitate addition and to determine if palmitates could direct specific plasma membrane targeting, sustain Ha-Ras membrane binding, and support biological function, a novel mammalian Ha-Ras protein was constructed, designed to have C-terminal palmitates, but no isoprenoid. The results indicate that, although farnesyl needs the assistance of palmitate for membrane binding and full biological function, palmitates can support substantial farnesyl-independent activity. The results begin to define distinct roles for Ha-Ras farnesyl and palmitate and suggest that palmitate is more than just an energetic form of membrane tether that serves the needs of the farnesyl and may have unique and dynamic biological roles of its own. Ext61L, ExtWT, Ext61L(C181S/C184S/C186S), ExtWT(C181S/C184S/C186S), and Ha-Ras61L were expressed from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To construct Ext61L, an S190K substitution followed by the addition of five lysine residues was introduced into Ha-Ras with a Q61L activating mutation by oligonucleotide-directed polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. The construction used an oligonucleotide 5′-GGGGGGATCCACCATGACAGAATACAAGCTT-3′, which was fully complementary to the 5′-sequences of human Ha-Ras, and the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-GGGGGGATCCTCACTTCTTCTTCTTCTTCTTGAGCACACACTTGCAGCT-3′, which reproduced the nucleotides complementary to the 3′-sequences of Ha-Ras and introduced the six lysine codons (underlined), a termination codon, and a BamHI restriction enzyme recognition site. The resulting pcDNA3-Ext61L cDNA was inserted as a BamHI fragment into the BamHI site of pcDNA3 and encoded the complete Ha-Ras protein with a C-terminal polylysine tail (Fig. 1 A). pcDNA3-ExtWT is identical to pcDNA3-Ext61L, except that it encodes the non-activated cellular form of Ha-Ras with the normal glutamine residue at position 61. Ext61L(C181S/C184S/C186S) and ExtWT(C181S/C184S/C186S) were constructed in a similar fashion using the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-GTACTCTAGATCACTTCTTCTTCTTCTTTTTTAACACACTCTTACTGCTCATAGAGCCAGGACC-3′ to introduce the six lysine codons (underlined) and to change codons 181, 184, and 186 from Cys to Ser (double underlined). The cDNA was inserted as a BamHI-NotI fragment into pcDNA3. PC12 cells were maintained at 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (both from Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) . Twenty-four hours before DNA transfection, PC12 cells were plated onto laminin (10 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.)-coated 60-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 106 cells/dish and grown overnight. Transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. NIH 3T3 cells were grown at 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Cells were transfected with plasmid DNAs encoding Ext61L or ExtWT Ras proteins using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (11Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar, 26Buss J.E. Solski P.A. Schaeffer J.P. MacDonald M.A. Der C.J. Science. 1989; 243: 1600-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Transformed foci were quantified after 7–14 days. Transfected cells were also selected in growth medium containing G418 (Geneticin, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 500 μg/ml to establish cell lines that stably expressed the mutant proteins. Subcellular fractions were prepared by lysis of cells in hypotonic buffer (0.1 mTris, pH 7.4, 0.5 m MgCl2, 1 mmPefabloc, 1 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, and 0.1% aprotinin (Calbiochem)) and addition of NaCl to adjust the ionic strength to 0.15 m, followed by ultracentrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g as described previously (26Buss J.E. Solski P.A. Schaeffer J.P. MacDonald M.A. Der C.J. Science. 1989; 243: 1600-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Hydrophobic (e.g. lipid-modified) proteins were isolated by separation into detergent (hydrophobic) and aqueous (hydrophilic) fractions by Triton X-114 lysis and phase separation as described (2Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). For testing release of proteins from the P100 membrane fraction, the supernatant (S100 = S1) was set aside, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and incubated on ice for 30 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g; the supernatant (S2) was collected; and the pellet was incubated with the high salt buffer a second time and centrifuged, yielding a third supernatant (S3). The pellet from the second salt wash (P3) was resuspended in 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and centrifuged, and the radioimmune precipitation assay extract (S4) removed. The proteins in the separate S1–S4 supernatants were precipitated with 10 ml of acetone for 1 h at 4 °C, collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 30 min, and dissolved in 100 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. Equal volumes of each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE. 1The abbreviation used is: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For protein labeling, cells were incubated with 200 μCi/plate Tran35S-label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking cysteine/methionine for 18 h. To examine isoprenoid attachment, cells were pretreated with 50 μmcompactin for 30 min and then labeled for 18 h with 100 μCi/ml [3H]mevalonolactone (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) in the continued presence of compactin (27Mumby S. Buss J.E. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 216-220Google Scholar). Palmitate incorporation and subsequent depalmitoylation were measured by labeling cells for 4 h with 1 mCi/ml [3H]palmitate (NEN Life Science Products) in medium containing nonessential amino acids, 25 μg/ml cycloheximide, and 10% calf serum and then incubating for varying times in nonradioactive medium containing 200 μmpalmitic acid. After radiolabeling, samples were prepared for subcellular fractionation as described above, or cells were lysed directly in high SDS/radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm aprotinin (Calbiochem)) for immunoprecipitation. Extracts of cell fractions were incubated on ice for 1 h with Ha-Ras-specific mouse monoclonal antibody 146-3E4 (Quality Biotech Inc., Camden, NJ). Immune complexes were recovered with Staphylococcus aureuscells (Pansorbin, Calbiochem) coated with goat anti-mouse heavy and light chain IgG; washed; resuspended in special sample buffer (2% SDS, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.05% dithiothreitol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue); resolved by SDS-PAGE; transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane; and, as needed, sprayed with EN3HANCE (NEN Life Science Products) for fluorography or developed for immunoblot analysis. For immunoblotting, after separation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubating the membrane in 1.25% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline. Membranes were probed with Ha-Ras-specific monoclonal antibody 146-3E4. Biotinylated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) were used with development by alkaline phosphatase (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) using the manufacturer's protocol. PC12 cells were plated at low density on serum-coated coverslips in six-well dishes and transfected with Ext61L DNA as described above. Following fixation with freshly prepared 2% paraformaldehyde, cells were treated with a blocking solution containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin and 3% horse serum to block nonspecific antibody interactions and 0.05% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween 20 to permeabilize the cells (28Skene J.H.P. Virag I. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 613-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cells were then treated with a 1:20 dilution of Ha-Ras-specific rat monoclonal antibody Y13-172, followed by a 1:50 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-rat secondary antibody (Cappel/Organon-Teknika, Durham, NC), both diluted in blocking solution; mounted in diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane/glycerol solution to prevent fading; and viewed by confocal microscopy. Confluent cultures of PC12 cells were grown overnight in 1% dialyzed calf serum. Cells were then radiolabeled with 0.5–1 mCi/ml 32Pi (NEN Life Science Products) for 4 h in phosphate-free medium containing 1% calf serum. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 0.6 ml of cold GTP lysis buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mmNa3VO4. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 750 × g for 3 min. Supernatants were cleared with 50% (v/v) bovine serum albumin-coated charcoal in lysis buffer, and then Ha-Ras proteins were captured by immunoprecipitation using GTP lysis buffer. Ha-Ras and its bound nucleotides were eluted by heating to 60 °C for 5 min in a minimal volume of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm GDP, and 2 mm GTP. The eluants were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and then samples were spotted on polyethyleneimine cellulose plates (J. T. Baker Inc.) and separated with 0.75 mKH2PO4, pH 3.4. Plates were dried and exposed to preflashed film using screen enhancers. The film images of GDP and GTP were scanned and quantified using the program ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.), and the percent of an Ha-Ras protein that contained bound GTP was calculated using the following formula: % with GTP = GTP/(GTP + 1.5 GDP). Multiple studies that had examined a great many mutations within and immediately N-terminal of the CAAX box of non-prenylated Ha-Ras or Ki-Ras4B proteins had all failed to detect membrane binding (a biochemical surrogate for potential palmitoylation). The only successful examples of palmitoylated forms that lacked isoprenoid were the yeast Ras2 mutants in which the CAAX box was extended with a series of basic amino acid residues (25Mitchell D.A. Farh L. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21540-21546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This work had suggested that lengthening and introducing positively charged residues enabled a yeast Ras2 protein to contact membranes and to become palmitoylated. The mammalian ExtRas proteins were therefore designed with a lysine in the X position of the CAAX box, which was anticipated would produce a nonfunctional prenylation motif, and five additional lysine residues to provide an ionic platform for interaction with acidic membrane phospholipids. The initial experiments determined the stability and size of the Ext61L protein and whether the carboxyl-terminal CVLKKKKKK sequence (Fig.1 A) prevented the Ext61L protein from being prenylated. This was important because it was possible the Ext61L protein would be vulnerable to proteolytic removal of these basic residues, which would remove the structure that was meant to initiate and assist membrane binding. Also, removal of five lysines would potentially recreate a CAAX box motif (CVLK) that might permit prenylation. This was not considered likely as the presence of a lysine at the X position had previously been found to prevent prenylation of a Ki-Ras4B protein (29Kato K. Cox A.D. Hisaka M.M. Graham S.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). If such trimming and prenylation were to occur, it could be detected because it would produce a smaller protein, similar in size to mature native Ha-Ras protein. An additional way to detect, indirectly, if prenylation was occurring was to treat cells with compactin. Compactin inhibits isoprenoid synthesis and hence decreases Ras prenylation, preventing the change in mobility and leading to the accumulation of the unmodified precursor form of Ha-Ras in the cytosol (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). To test these possibilities, COS cells expressing Ext61L were labeled metabolically with [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of compactin. Cytosolic and membrane-containing fractions were prepared, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by fluorography. The Ext61L protein was easily detected and had the appropriate, slightly slower mobility than the endogenous Ha-Ras protein of COS cells, indicating that the C-terminal residues of Ext61L were retained (Fig. 1 B). More important, a significant portion (40%) of the Ext61L protein was detected in the membrane-containing fraction and had the same apparent size as the cytosolic protein. This similarity in size of proteins in the S100 and P100 fractions indicated indirectly that the extension protein was not farnesylated. In addition, compactin did not decrease the amount of Ext61L protein that was present in the P100 fraction. Without compactin treatment, >90% of the small amount of endogenous Ha-Ras protein in untransfected or transfected COS cells (Fig. 1 B) was found in the membrane fraction. In the compactin-treated cells, the amount of membrane-bound endogenous Ha-Ras decreased; the increased amount of the precursor form in the cytosol was obscured by the large amount of soluble Ext61L protein. To evaluate more directly whether the Ext61L protein remained unmodified by isoprenoid, COS cells expressing this protein or Ha-Ras61L were labeled with [3H]mevalonic acid, and the Ras proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation. No incorporation of radioactivity could be detected in the Ext61L lane (Fig. 1 C,lane 2). However, labeling of cells expressing Ha-Ras61L confirmed that an Ha-Ras protein with an intact CAAX motif could be prenylated (Fig. 1 C,lane 1). In addition, immunoblot detection of the same membrane confirmed that the Ext61L protein was expressed (data not shown). These results indicated that the Ext61L protein was not prenylated. Although a significant amount of Ext61L protein was found in the membrane-containing fraction in the cells, the extent of binding of the Ext61L protein was far less than the >95% binding attained by endogenous Ha-Ras with the natural version of the C terminus. Previously constructed C-terminal mutants of v-Ha-Ras had also shown decreased or delayed membrane binding compared with v-Ha-Ras with the normal C-terminal residues and modifications (11Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar). To examine if the decreased membrane association of Ext61L reflected inefficient trafficking or attachment to membranes, the speed with which newly synthesized Ext61L traversed the cytosol and achieved membrane a"

In this location, enteropeptidase cleaves and activates trypsinogen, thereby initiating the activation of other intestinal digestive enzymes. Recombinant bovine enteropeptidase was sorted directly to the apical surface of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Replacement of the cytoplasmic and signal anchor domains with a cleavable signal peptide (mutant proenteropeptidase lacking the amino-terminal signal anchor domain (dSA-BEK)) caused apical secretion. The additional amino-terminal deletion of a mucin-like domain (HL-BEK) resulted in secretion both apically and basolaterally. Further deletion of the noncatalytic heavy chain (L-BEK) resulted in apical secretion. Thus enteropeptidase appears to have at least three distinct sorting signals as follows: the light chain (L-BEK) directs apical sorting, addition of most of the heavy chain (HL-BEK) inhibits apical sorting, and addition of the mucin-like domain (dSA-BEK) restores apical sorting. Inhibition of N-linked glycosylation with tunicamycin or disruption of microtubules with colchicine caused L-BEK to be secreted equally into apical and basolateral compartments, whereas brefeldin A caused basolateral secretion of L-BEK. Full-length BEK was not found in detergent-resistant raft domains of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or baby hamster kidney cells. These results suggest apical sorting of enteropeptidase depends on N-linked glycosylation of the serine protease domain and an amino-terminal segment that includes an O-glycosylated mucin-like domain and three potential N-glycosylation sites.

In contrast to many apically targeted proteins, enteropeptidase does not form detergent-resistant associations with sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts. Enteropeptidase (enterokinase) is a protease of the duodenal brush border that cleaves and activates trypsinogen. The resultant trypsin then activates other pancreatic digestive zymogens within the lumen of the gut. Deficiency of enteropeptidase causes intestinal malabsorption (1Hadorn B. Tarlow M.J. Lloyd J.K. Wolff O.H. Lancet. 1969; i: 812-813Abstract Google Scholar, 2Haworth J.C. Gourley B. Hadorn B. Sumida C. J.

Therefore, the localization of enteropeptidase is important to normal digestive physiology. Enteropeptidase consists of a disulfide-linked heterodimer with a heavy chain of 82–140 kDa and a light chain of 35–62 kDa. Both chains of mammalian enteropeptidases contain 30–50% carbohydrate, and this extensive glycosylation may contribute to the apparent variation in polypeptide masses (reviewed in Ref. 5Lu D.

The amino-terminal heavy chain contains domains that are homologous to sequences of O-glycosylated epithelial mucins, the low density lipoprotein receptor, complement components C1r and C1s, the macrophage scavenger receptor, and a recently described MAM motif. The carboxyl-terminal light chain is homologous to the trypsin-like serine proteases (reviewed in Ref. 5Lu D. Sadler J.E. Barrett A.J. Rawlings N.D. Woessner Jr., J.F. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press Ltd., London1998: 50-54Google Scholar). Studies of recombinant bovine enteropeptidase demonstrate that membrane association is mediated by a signal anchor sequence near the amino terminus (12Lu D. Yuan X. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31293-31300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The structures on enteropeptidase that direct it to apical membranes have not been characterized. Basolateral targeting generally is mediated by discrete amino acid sequence motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins, whereas the nature of apical targeting signals remains controversial. Apical targeting appears to depend on distributed features of protein ectodomains or transmembrane domains, and there may be several apical targeting mechanisms (13Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For some proteins, apical targeting requires N-linked oligosaccharides (14Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K.

Apical sorting determinants may function, in part, by promoting association with sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts that deliver proteins to the apical cell surface (20Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (7948) Google Scholar). However, some apical proteins appear not to associate with rafts and lack any of the currently recognized apical sorting signals (e.g. Ref. 21Alonso M.A. Fan L. Alarcon B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30748-30752Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and proteins may be sorted differently in different cell types (13Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3001-3009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the mechanism of apical protein targeting remains poorly understood.

Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), to investigate the targeting of enteropeptidase. The results indicate that signals involved in apical delivery reside in the catalytic domain and in an amino-terminal segment that includes the mucin-like domain. Apical delivery of this type II transmembrane protein requires intact post-Golgi transport vesicles and depends on N-linked glycosylation. Unlike many other apically targeted proteins, delivery of enteropeptidase appears not to involve detergent-resistant association with sphingolipid-cholesterol rafts. Plasmid pBEK, containing the full-length cDNA sequence of bovine enteropeptidase, was assembled in vector pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene) from cDNA clones isolated previously (7Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert of pBEK was cloned into theSmaI site of plasmid pNUT (23Palmiter R.D. Behringer R.R. Quaife C.J. Maxwell F. Maxwell I.H. Brinster R.L. Cell. 1987; 50: 435-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) to produce expression plasmid pNUTBEK. Plasmids pNUTHL, pNUTL, pBlue-HL, and pBlue-L were described previously (12Lu D. Yuan X. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31293-31300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In pNUTHL and pBlue-HL, the sequence encoding amino acids 1–197 was replaced by a signal peptide cassette consisting of the cleavable signal peptide of prothrombin, a His6 tag, thrombin cleavage site, and T7 epitope tag. In plasmid pNUTL and pBlue-L, the same signal peptide cassette replaced the sequence encoding amino acids 1–783. Additional plasmids derived from pBEK were constructed using oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (12Lu D. Yuan X. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31293-31300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In plasmid pdSA, the sequence encoding the signal-anchor domain (residues 1–49) was replaced by the prothrombin signal peptide cassette from plasmid pNUTHL. To add the epitope tag DYKDDDDK to the carboxyl terminus of full-length recombinant enteropeptidase, the DNA sequence 5′-gac tac aag gac gac gat gac aag tag-3′ was inserted before the stop codon of plasmid pBEK, generating the plasmid pBEKflag. Plasmid pdSALflag was derived from pdSA by inserting the same oligonucleotide sequence before the codon for residue 787, thereby deleting the light chain and appending the DYKDDDDK tag. The cDNA inserts of pBEK, pBEKflag, pdSA, pdSALflag pBlue-HL, and pBlue-L were excised from the vectors with NotI and ApaI or NotI andHindIII and cloned into vectors pcDNA3, pcDNA3.1, or pcDNAI (Invitrogen) to yield plasmids pcDNA3-BEK, pcDNA3-BEKflag, pcDNA3.1-dSA, pcDNA3.1-dSAdLflag, pcDNAI-HL, and pcDNAI-L, respectively. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were grown in six-well plates and transfected with 5 μg of plasmid pNUT-BEK, pNUT-HL, and pNUT-L, and 30 μg of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). After 5 h fetal bovine serum was added to 10%. After an additional 18 h, cultures were split 1:10 for selection in 0.5 mg/ml methotrexate for 10 days. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK-II) cells (ATCC) were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid pcDNA3-BEK, pcDNA3-BEKflag, pcDNA3.1-dSA, pcDNA3.1-dSAdLflag, pcDNAI-HL, or pcDNAI-L and PerFect lipids (pfx-2) (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and clones were selected with 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cDNA sequence encoding the light chain of bovine enteropeptidase (amino acids 784–1035) was cloned into the XhoI site of plasmid pET-28a(+) (Novagen) to yield plasmid pET-L. Epicurean coli BL21 (DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) transformed with plasmid pET-L were grown in LB broth containing ampicillin, and protein expression was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and cells were lysed with 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 6 m urea, 300 mm imidazole, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. After centrifugation, the supernatant solution was dialyzed against binding buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing decreasing concentrations of urea (4 m to zero). Recombinant enteropeptidase light chain was purified by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (12Lu D. Yuan X. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31293-31300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to the purified light chain were prepared in rabbits by standard methods (24Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 92-135Google Scholar). Specific immune IgG against denatured light chain (anti-L) was purified by sequential affinity chromatography on protein A-agarose and on enteropeptidase light chain immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Antibodies against native enteropeptidase light chain were prepared similarly. The cDNA insert encoding amino acids 785–1035 of pBlue-L was cloned into baculovirus expression vector pVL1392 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Plasmid pVL1392-L was co-transfected into Sf9 cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) with BaculoGold DNA (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) to generate recombinant virus. Enteropeptidase light chain was expressed by infection of High Five cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified by affinity chromatography on soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose (Sigma). 2D. Lu, X. Zheng, and J. E. Sadler, manuscript in preparation. Polyclonal antibody against the purified active L-BEK was raised in rabbits (TANA Laboratories, Houston, TX), and the immune serum was designated anti-Lv. Stably transfected BHK or MDCK II cell lines were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were lysed directly in the plate at room temperature with sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (PBS) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 3 μm aprotinin (1 ml/107 cells). After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min in a microcentrifuge, the supernatants were stored at −70 °C. For Western blotting, proteins were fractionated in 4–15% gradient polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred by electroblotting onto supported nitrocellulose membranes (pore size 0.4 μm, Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 3% non-fat milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature for 30 min. The blocked membrane was incubated with 1.5 μg/ml affinity purified anti-L-IgG or anti-Lv-antiserum (1:4000) diluted in TBST containing 1.5% non-fat milk at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were washed four times with TBST, once with TBS, and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated affinity purified swine anti-rabbit IgG (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) 0.12 μg/ml in TBST containing 1.5% milk at room temperature for 1–2 h. Bound second antibody was detected with the chemiluminescent ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To analyze theN-glycosylation of proenteropeptidase, 10 μl of BHK cell lysate or conditioned medium was incubated at 100 °C for 5 min in 30 μl total volume of 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA-Na, 0.4% SDS, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% sodium azide. Denatured and reduced proteins (30 μl) were then digested without (control) or with 0.5 units of peptide-N-glycosidase F (Oxford Glycosciences, Bedford, MA) or 1 milliunit of endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) in a total volume of 30 μl at 37 °C for 16 h. Samples (10 μl) of these digested materials were analyzed by Western blotting. For digestion with neuraminidase and O-glycanase, BHK cells expressing BEK were pulse-labeled with 200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label (>1000 Ci/mmol, containing 75% [35S]methionine, 15% [35S]cysteine, ICN Pharmaceuticals) at 37 °C for 30 min and chased for 60 min with complete DMEM containing an excess of unlabeled methionine (15 μg/ml) and cysteine (50 μg/ml). Cell lysates were prepared as described above, pre-cleared for 60 min with protein A-Sepharose 4B (50 μl/ml sample), and incubated with anti-Lv (5–10 μl/ml lysate) and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. After addition of protein A-Sepharose 4B (50 μl), samples were incubated for 60 min at room temperature. The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed four times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and once with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Antigen-antibody complexes were eluted by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min with 100 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5% SDS. Samples of eluate (20 μl) or 20 ng of purified HL-BEK (12Lu D. Yuan X. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31293-31300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) were digested without or with 0.5 units of PNGase F, 20 milliunits of neuraminidase (Boehringer Mannheim) or 20 milliunits of neuraminidase plus 2 milliunits of O-glycanase (Genzyme Diagnostic, Cambridge, MA) in 20 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 10 mm calcium acetate, 0.2% SDS, and 2% Nonidet P-40 at 37 °C for 20 h. The products were separated electrophoretically by 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE; radiolabeled BEK and unlabeled HL-BEK were detected by autoradiography and silver staining, respectively. BHK cell lines were washed three times with ice-cold PBS, incubated with 1.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min, and reaction was stopped with 50 mm glycine in PBS. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 3 μm aprotinin. Surface biotin-labeled proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose at room temperature for 2 h. After washing four times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, the biotin-streptavidin-agarose complexes were eluted from beads by heating at 100 °C for 5 min with 30 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol. The cell lysate, flow-through, and eluate fractions from streptavidin-agarose were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting. Transfected BHK cell lines in six-well plates were washed with PBS and treated without (control) or with 5 μg/ml trypsin-l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (Worthington) in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. Residual trypsin was inactivated by addition of a 2-fold excess of soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and lysed with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml PMSF, 24 μg/ml aprotinin, 1.5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was collected for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Stably transfected MDCK II cells were grown on clear Costar Transwell filters (pore size 0.4 μm) until a tight monolayer was formed as shown by the transepithelial resistance. The filters were washed with PBS and fixed at 4 °C for 15 min in PBS containing 1.5% paraformaldehyde (25Beau I. Misrahi M. Gross B. Vannier B. Loosfelt H. Hai M.T. Pichon C. Milgrom E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or ethanol:acetic acid (9:1). Cells were washed sequentially with PBS followed by PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, and 1% goat serum and then incubated in PBS containing 20 μg/ml rabbit anti-Lv serum (1:100) or anti-caveolin IgG (1:500) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), 1% BSA, and 1% goat serum at 4 °C overnight. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and once with PBS and then incubated with Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibody (15 μg/ml diluted with TBS containing 1.5% non-immune goat serum) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at room temperature for 60 min. After washing, the filters were cut out and mounted on slides with glycerol mounting medium (Sigma) and examined with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Zeiss Axioplan/Bio-Rad MRC1024). To detect membrane-bound enteropeptidase, stably transfected MDCK cells were grown on six-well Costar Transwell filters (pore size 0.4 μm) until a tight monolayer was formed as shown by the transepithelial resistance. Cells were pulse-labeled with 150–200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label at 37 °C for 30 min and chased for 30 min with complete DMEM containing 150 μg/ml unlabeled methionine. Either the apical or basolateral cell surface was incubated with 1.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (NHS-SS-biotin, Pierce) at 4 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped with 50 mm glycine in PBS (10 ml per 100-mm dish), and cell lysates were prepared as described above. Enteropeptidase was immunoprecipitated with anti-Lv (10–30 μg/ml sample) and protein A-Sepharose 4B (50 μl). Antigen-antibody complexes were eluted by boiling at 100 °C for 10 min with 100 μl of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% SDS. The eluate was diluted to 500 μl with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and biotin-labeled proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose as described above. Proteins were eluted from streptavidin-agarose with Laemmli sample buffer containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol, separated on 4–15% gradient mini-ready gels (Bio-Rad), fixed with 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, treated with Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to XAR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −70 °C. Alternatively, to detect secreted forms of enteropeptidase, conditioned medium from either apical or basolateral surfaces was collected, immunoprecipitated with anti-Ly, and fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The enteropeptidase then was visualized by either autoradiography (if labeled with Tran35S-label) or Western blotting. MDCK II cells transfected with pcDNAI-L were grown on Costar Transwell filters until formation of a tight monolayer as determined by transepithelial resistance measurements. Cells were then treated without or with 2 μg/ml tunicamycin or 10 μg/ml brefeldin A in serum-free DMEM for 24 h. The cell viability and integrity of the monolayer were confirmed after treatment by measuring the transepithelial resistance. Conditioned media were collected from either apical or basolateral surfaces and concentrated 10-fold by ultrafiltration (Centriprep-10). Samples (20 μl) of concentrated media were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting as described above. The amount ofL-BEK secreted from either surface was quantitated with NIH Image version 1.61 (26Marzolo M.P. Bull P. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Detergent extractability of enteropeptidase was determined according to Brown and Rose (27Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2588) Google Scholar). Confluent cell monolayers in 10-cm dishes were labeled with 200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label in serum-free DMEM without methionine for 30 min at 37 °C and chased at 37 or 20 °C with DMEM, F-12 HEPES medium containing an excess of unlabeled methionine (15 μg/ml) and cysteine (50 μg/ml). The cells were lysed with 1 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 3 μm aprotinin) for 10 min on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 5 min in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant (Triton X-100 soluble fraction) was removed. The pellet (Triton X-100 insoluble fraction) was dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS; DNA was sheared by passage through a 22-gauge needle, and the solution was diluted by addition of 900 μl of extraction buffer. Enteropeptidase was immunoprecipitated from soluble and insoluble fractions with anti-Lv (5 μl/ml) for analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as described above. Detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched raft domains were prepared by a modification of the Triton X-100 procedure of Pike and Casey (28Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Confluent cells in 100-mm dishes were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3 mm aprotinin. Lysates were incubated for 20 min on ice with intermittent gentle agitation and then mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl). Six ml of 30% sucrose in MBS followed by 4 ml of 5% sucrose in MBS were layered on top of each sample. The gradients were centrifuged at 4 °C for 23 h at 175,000 × g (39,000 rpm, Beckman SW40 rotor). Fractions of 1.2 ml were collected, and the small insoluble pellet was resuspended in 600 μl of lysis buffer by homogenization (25,000 rpm, 1 min) with a Brinkmann homogenizer (Kinematica AG, Switzerland). Proteins in the fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 30 min, and pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of 0.2 n NaOH. Samples (20 μl) of trichloroacetic acid-concentrated fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with either anti-Lv (1:4,000) or anti-caveolin IgG (1:10,000) (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). BHK cells expressing BEK were cultured in 150-mm dishes to 90% confluency in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum and washed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS. Cells were incubated without (control) or with anti-Lv (preabsorbed with non-transfected BHK cell lysate coupled on Affi-Gel 10) at a dilution of 1:1000 in serum-free DMEM, 0.1% BSA at 12 °C for 60 min. After washing three times with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS, cells were further incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) at 12 °C for 60 min. Cells were scraped into 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.3 mm aprotinin. Sucrose gradient centrifugation and Western blotting were performed as described above. For immunofluorescence, cells grown on slide chambers were either fixed with acetic acid:ethanol (1:9) on ice for 10 min and incubated with anti-Lv (1:1000) and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:50), or first cross-linked with prima"

Treatment of F9 EC cells with retinoic acid (RA) induces differentiation toward primitive endoderm (PrE), while differentiation toward PE is induced by subsequent addition of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or PTH-related peptide (PTHrP). The signal transduction mechanisms involved in this two-step process are largely unclear.We show that the RA-induced differentiation toward PrE is accompanied by a sustained increase in Ras activity and that ectopic expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras is sufficient to induce PrE differentiation. Ras activity subsequently decreases upon PTH-induced differentiation toward PE. This is a necessary event, since expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras in PrE-like cells prevents PTH-induced PE differentiation. Expression of active PKA in PrE-like F9 cells mimics PTH-induced PE differentiation and is again prevented by oncogenic Ha-Ras. The effect of oncogenic Ras on both differentiation steps is abolished by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 and can be mimicked by constitutively active forms of Raf and MEK.In conclusion, our data suggest that activation of the Ras/Erk is sufficient to induce differentiation to PrE and to prevent subsequent differentiation toward PE. Activation of PKA down-regulates Ras activity, resulting in disappearance of this blockade and transmission of signal(s) triggering PE differentiation.

Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the cells can be differentiated toward a parietal endoderm (PE)-like phenotype by addition of cAMP-elevating agents (2Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). The first step of differentiation is accompanied by morphological changes and disappearance of the stage-specific embryonic antigen (SSEA-1) (3Solter D. Knowles B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The second step of differentiation is accompanied by morphological changes as well and is characterized by the appearance of thrombomodulin (6Imada M. Imada S. Iwasaki H. Kume A. Yamaguchi H.

Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that PTH or PTHrP can substitute for Bt2cAMP in the differentiation of PrE to PE (8Chan S.D.H. Strewler G.J. King K.L. Nissenson R.A. Mol.

Furthermore, expression patterns of PTHrP and the PTH/PTHrP receptor suggest that this signaling system functions in PE formation in vivo (9van de Stolpe A. Karperien M. Löwik C.W.G.M. Jüppner H.

Löwik, S. W. De Laat, H. M. Kronenberg, and L. H. K. Defize, submitted for publication. PTH and PTHrP bind to a common receptor, which couples to at least two G proteins, Gs and Gq, resulting in activation of both the adenylate cyclase and the phospholipase Cβ-mediated signal transduction pathways (12Abou-Samra A.B. Jüppner H. Force T. Freeman M.W. Kong X.F. Schipani E. Urena P. Richards J. Bonventre J.V. Potts Jr., J.T. Kronenberg H.M. Segre G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We recently demonstrated that PTH, by elevation of intracellular cAMP levels, can affect the Ras/Erk pathway in a cell type-specific fashion (14Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. J. Biol.

The mammalian ras family encodes membrane-bound GTPases, which are essential in transduction of extracellular signals involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Activation of receptors catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras. In the active GTP-bound state, Ras will bind to its effectors and influence their biological activity. Ras is inactivated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which increase the rate of GTP hydrolysis, resulting in an inactive GDP-bound state (16Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 17Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1124) Google Scholar). The best characterized Ras-dependent signal transduction pathway involves the activation of the Raf/Erk cascade. Activated Ras interacts with Raf-1 and translocates it to the plasma membrane where it is exposed to activating kinases and/or lipids (18Morrison D.K. Cutler Jr., R.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 9: 174-179Google Scholar). Activated Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates MEK, leading to the phosphorylation and activation of Erk (16Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Besides its transforming potential, Ras can affect the differentiation of several cell types. Oncogenic Ras inhibits myoblast differentiation (19Konieczny S.F. Drobes B.L. Menke S.L. Taparowsky E.J. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 473-482PubMed Google Scholar) and induces dedifferentiation of thyroid cells (20Avvedimento V.E. Musti A.M. Ueffing M. Obici S. Gallo A. Sanchez M. DeBrasi D. Gottesman M.E. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the other hand, oncogenic Ras is sufficient to induce differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes (21Benito M. Porras A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E. Science. 1991; 253: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and to induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (22Noda M. Ko M. Ogura A. Liu D.G. Amano T. Takano T. Ikawa Y. Nature. 1985; 318: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Here we examined the role of Ras and Erk in endoderm differentiation of F9 EC cells. We show that the Ras/Erk pathway plays an important role in this two-step differentiation process, since sustained Ras activity is observed during PrE differentiation and is sufficient to induce it, while Ras activity needs to be down-regulated by PTH prior to differentiation toward PE. Finally, we show that the effect of Ras on both differentiation processes is mediated by Erk.

F9 EC cells were obtained from the ATCC and cultured on gelatinized surface in medium consisting of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 containing 7.5% fetal calf serum. Unless denoted otherwise, differentiation to PrE-like cells was performed by culture in monolayer in the presence of 1 μm RA for 3 days. To obtain PE-like cells, this treatment was followed by 1 mm Bt2cAMP or 100 nm PTH-(1–34) for 2 days. Transient transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. In the case of transfections with β-gal to identify transfected cells, undifferentiated F9 cells and F9 cells treated with RA for 3 days, were plated in concentrations of, respectively, 3 × 103 and 2 × 104 cells/cm2 on 13-mm tissue coverslips (Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC) in 25-compartment clusters (Greiner). The following day cells were transfected for 6 h, using LipofectAMINE, with pSV2-lacZ (0.3 μg) and RasLeu-61 (0.3 μg), RasAsn-17 (0.3 μg), Raf-CAAX (0.3 μg), MEK-D218/222 (0.3 μg), or pMT-PKACα (0.3 μg), unless denoted otherwise. PUC-RSV plasmid was added to bring the total amount of DNA to 1 μg. Where appropriate, RA, PTH-(1–34), and Bt2AMP were added the day after transfection. In the case of transfection for transient HA-Erk assays, undifferentiated F9 cells, and F9 cells treated with RA for 3 days, were plated in concentrations of, respectively, 3 × 103 and 2 × 104 cells/cm2 in six-well tissue culture clusters. The following day cells were transfected for 6 h, using LipofectAMINE, with PSG5-HA-Erk (0.6 μg) and RasLeu-61 (0.6 μg), Raf-CAAX (0.6 μg) or MEK-D218/222 (0.6 μg), unless denoted otherwise. PUC-RSV plasmid was added to bring the total amount of DNA to 2 μg. To culture F9 EC cells in such a concentration that cell densities were comparable after 5 days of culture, cells to be treated without or with RA for 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days were plated at concentrations of, respectively, 150, 200, 300, 500, 800, or 1000 cells/cm2 in six-well tissue culture clusters. Erk phosphorylation was measured by Western blotting with anti-p42 MAP kinase antibodies as described previously (30Burgering B.M.T. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p42 MAP kinase is detected as a band with reduced mobility compared with unphosphorylated p42 MAP kinase (31Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated at least three times and representative results are shown. For determination of Erk activity, epitope-tagged p42 HA-MAP kinase was immunoprecipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads coupled to monoclonal antibody 12CA5, as described previously (15Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3423-3429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). After the kinase reaction with myelin basic protein as a substrate, the reaction mix was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was measured using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). F9 cells were plated in 9-cm tissue culture dishes at similar concentrations as described above in “activation and phosphorylation of Erk.” In vivo Ras activity was determined with the minimal Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1 as an activation-specific probe for Ras, as described previously (32de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 33Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke R. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In short, cell lysates were brought to equal protein concentrations, and active Ras was precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads coupled to GST-RBD. Precipitated Ras was detected by Western blotting using the rat monoclonal antibody Y13-259. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, incubated with an 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside staining solution (PBS with 0.8 mg/ml X-gal (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mg/ml K3FE(CN)6, 1.3 mg/ml K4FE(CN)6), and subsequently incubated with 20 mm NH4Cl for 30 min. For detection of SSEA-1, cells were incubated for 1 h in PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin and subsequent antibody incubations were done in PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin as well. For detection of TROMA-1 and thrombomodulin, cells were incubated for 1 h in NETGEL (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) gelatin, 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide), and subsequent antibody incubations were done in NETGEL as well. Incubations with first antibodies were for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were rinsed extensively in PBS and incubated with CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Groove, PA) for 1 h at room temperature, again extensively rinsed, and mounted in Moviol. Previous work has suggested an involvement of the Ras/Erk pathway in PrE differentiation of F9 EC cells. It was shown that expression of oncogenic Ras in F9 EC cells is sufficient to induce differentiation to endoderm-like cells (34Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Satake M. Murakami Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8670-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and furthermore that RA-generated PrE-like F9 cells have a higher level of p42 MAP kinase activity than undifferentiated F9 cells (35Gao P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To get more insight in the role of Ras and Erk in PrE differentiation, we determined the activity of Ras and Erk during RA-induced differentiation. This was performed by using the RBD of Raf-1 as a specific probe for activated Ras, as described previously (32de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 33Wolthuis R.M.F. Franke R. van Triest M. Bauer B. Cool R.H. Camonis J.H. Akkerman J.W.N. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2486-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 36Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Ras activity was measured as the amount of Ras precipitated with GST-Raf-RBD. Treatment of F9 EC cells with RA strongly induced Ras activity, which was not due to increased Ras expression (Fig.1 A). RA activated Ras already after 24 h, while longer treatments resulted in a further up-regulation of Ras activity. Comparable kinetics were observed for the RA-induced Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B), indicating that Erk activation is mediated by Ras activation. It has been reported that oncogenic Ras induces endoderm differentiation of F9 EC cells (34Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Satake M. Murakami Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8670-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, a lack of proper PrE- and/or PE-specific markers made it difficult to distinguish between both cell types at that time. Recently, thrombomodulin has been shown to be a suitable marker for PE, both in vitro as well as in vivo(7Weiler-Guettler H. Aird W.C. Rayburn H. Husain M. Rosenberg R.D. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2271-2281PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore transiently transfected F9 EC cells with constructs encoding β-galactosidase (β-gal) and oncogenic Ras, RasLeu-61, and determined the phenotype of β-gal-expressing cells by morphology and by immunofluorescence using antibodies against phenotype-specific markers. When F9 EC cells were transfected with control plasmids, they remained undifferentiated, as reflected in the expression of the stem cell marker SSEA-1 (3Solter D. Knowles B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5565-5569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar) (Fig.2, A, B, andI). However, when cells were transfected with RasLeu-61, the number of transfected SSEA-1-positive cells decreased with approximately 80% (Fig. 2, C, D, and I). This was comparable with the decrease in SSEA-1 expression induced by RA-treatment (Fig. 2 I). As a positive marker for PrE differentiation we used TROMA-1 (4Duprey P. Morello D. Vasseur M. Babinet C. Condamine H. Brûlet P. Jacob F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8535-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 5Kemler R. Brûlet P. Schnebelin M.T. Gaillard J. Jacob F. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1981; 64: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar). Undifferentiated cells did not express TROMA-1 (Fig. 2, E, F, and J), while RasLeu-61 induced expression of TROMA-1 in approximately 70% of the transfected cells (Fig. 2, G, H, and J), which was even higher than in RA-treated cells (35%) (Fig. 2 J). Furthermore, RasLeu-61 expressing cells showed an enlarged and flattened morphology, which was similar to the morphology of RA-differentiated cells, and is characteristic for PrE cells (1Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). We could not detect expression of thrombomodulin in the RasLeu-61-differentiated cells (not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the transient expression of oncogenic Ras induced differentiation toward a PrE-like phenotype, without further differentiation to PE. As was shown in Fig. 1 B, the RA-induced PrE differentiation is accompanied by a sustained increase in Erk activity. The importance of Erk activity in RA- and/or Ras-induced PrE differentiation was investigated with the specific MEK inhibitor PD98059 (37Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). A continuous treatment of F9 EC cells with PD98059 completely blocked the activation of a transfected hemagglutinin-tagged p42 MAP kinase by RA or cotransfected RasLeu-61 (Fig.3 A). Under these conditions, RasLeu-61-induced PrE differentiation was completely abolished, while RA-induced PrE differentiation was unaffected, as based on the appearance of a PrE-like morphology (not shown) and expression of the differentiation marker TROMA-1 (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were found by cotransfecting NΔraf, a dominant-negative mutant of Raf-1 (38Schaap D. van der Wal J. Howe L.R. Marshall C.J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20232-20236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, Ras-induced PrE differentiation is dependent on Erk, in contrast to RA-induced PrE differentiation. To determine whether activation of the Raf/Erk cascade is sufficient to induce PrE differentiation, we transiently transfected F9 EC cells with constitutive active forms of Raf (Raf-CAAX) (24Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar) and MAP kinase kinase (MEK-D218/222) (25Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3379-3387PubMed Google Scholar). Both Raf-CAAX as well as MEK-D218/222 strongly induce a PrE-like morphology (not shown) and TROMA-1 expression (Fig. 3 C). Taken together, the data show that activation of the Ras/Erk cascade is sufficient to induce PrE differentiation, but that RA can induce PrE differentiation via Ras/Erk-independent pathway(s) as well. When F9 EC cells are differentiated to PrE, they can subsequently be differentiated to PE by addition of Bt2cAMP, PTH, or PTHrP (2Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 8Chan S.D.H. Strewler G.J. King K.L. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 638-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9van de Stolpe A. Karperien M. Löwik C.W.G.M. Jüppner H. Segre G.V. Abou-Samra A.B. de Laat S.W. Defize L.H.K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In previous studies we demonstrated that PTH, by elevation of cAMP levels, can either inhibit or activate Erk activity, depending on the cell type studied (14Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3423-3429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we determined the effect of PTH and Bt2cAMP on Ras and Erk activity in PrE-like F9 cells. Endogenous Ras activity decreased when cells were differentiated to PE upon addition of PTH(1–34) (Fig. 4 A). The PTH-induced inhibition of Ras activity is likely mediated by elevation of cAMP levels, since treatment with Bt2cAMP rapidly inhibited Ras activity (Fig. 4 B). Longer treatment resulted in a further decrease in Ras activity, while Ras activity was almost completely inhibited after treatment with Bt2AMP for 48 h, when the cells were fully differentiated toward PE. Importantly, expression levels of Ras were not changed. The inhibition of Ras activity was reflected in the down-regulation of Erk activity (Fig. 4 C), which occurred with similar kinetics, suggesting a causal relation between the inhibitory effect of PTH on Ras and Erk activity. The down-regulation of Ras and Erk activity might play a crucial role in the PTH-induced PE differentiation. We therefore investigated the effects of ectopic expression of either oncogenic Ras, thereby overruling the PTH-induced inhibition of Ras activity, or a dominant negative mutant of Ras, RasAsn-17, thus mimicking the inhibition of endogenous Ras activity. RA-treated F9 cells were cotransfected with a construct encoding β-gal to identify transfected cells. PE differentiation of β-gal-expressing cells was measured by morphology and thrombomodulin expression. The RA-treated control cells had a PrE-like morphology and did not express thrombomodulin (Fig.5, A and B). Transfections with either RasLeu-61 or RasAsn-17 did not change the PrE-like morphology nor did they induce expression of thrombomodulin (Fig. 5 K, no ligand). Treatment with PTH-(1–34) induced differentiation toward PE, resulting in the typical change in morphology and expression of thrombomodulin in approximately 20% of the cells (Fig. 5, C, D, andK). It should be noted that this low efficiency of PTH-induced PE differentiation is probably due to the transfection procedure, since normally PTH induces PE differentiation in approximately 50% of the cells. Transfection with oncogenic Ras had a dramatic effect on PTH action, the cells maintained their PrE-like morphology and did not express thrombomodulin, resulting in the occurrence of a PE-like phenotype in only 5% of the transfected cells (Fig. 5, E, F, and K). Expression of RasAsn-17 to interfere with Ras activation slightly enhanced the PTH-induced PE differentiation (Fig. 5 K). These results show that high levels of Ras activity in PTH-treated cells prevent differentiation toward PE, and that inhibition of Ras activity by itself is necessary but not sufficient for PE differentiation to occur. The inhibition of PTH-induced PE differentiation by Ras can be at different levels, Ras could interfere at the level of the PTH/PTHrP receptor or downstream of the receptor within the phospholipase C or the adenylate cyclase pathway. We therefore determined the effect of oncogenic Ras on Bt2cAMP-induced PE differentiation. Addition of Bt2cAMP to RA-generated PrE-like F9 cells induced a PE-like phenotype in 45–50% of the cells (Fig.5 L). This was strongly inhibited by expression of oncogenic Ras, to approximately 10%, suggesting that Ras interferes with PTH-induced PE differentiation downstream of cAMP. The major effector of cAMP elevation is PKA. However, cAMP has been shown to induce PKA-independent effects, like direct regulation of ion channels and transporter proteins (39Piper R.C. James D.E. Slot J.W. Puri C. Lawrence Jr., J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16557-16563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Menini A. Biophys. Chem. 1995; 55: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 41Varnum M.D. Black K.D. Zagotta W.N. Neuron. 1995; 15: 619-625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bt2cAMP can also mediate cAMP-independent effects via butyrate (42Leder A. Leder P. Cell. 1975; 5: 319-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). To determine whether activation of PKA is sufficient to induce PE differentiation, we transfected RA-treated F9 cells with the catalytic subunit of PKA. This induced a PE-like phenotype in approximately 45% of the transfected cells (Fig. 5, G, H, and M). Also the PKA-induced PE differentiation could be inhibited by coexpression of oncogenic Ras, which reduced the number of PKA-induced thrombomodulin expressing cells to 5–10% (Fig. 5,I, J, and M). This suggests that Ras interferes with PTH-induced PE differentiation at the level of or downstream of PKA. The decrease in endogenous Ras activity, which was observed when PrE-like F9 cells were differentiated to PE by addition of PTH or Bt2cAMP, strongly correlated with the decrease in Erk activity (Fig. 4). To determine whether the inhibitory effect of Ras on PE differentiation was depending on Erk activity, we used PD98059. Like in F9 EC cells (Fig. 3 A), a continuous treatment with PD98059 blocked the RA- as well as the RasLeu-61-induced Erk activity in PrE-like F9 cells (not shown). PD98059 did not induce a PE-like morphology by itself (not shown) nor thrombomodulin expression (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that inhibition of Erk activity is not sufficient to induce differentiation of PrE-like F9 cells to PE. Interestingly, PD98059 did however significantly enhance PKA-induced PE differentiation (29.6versus 46.9%, Fig. 6 A), indicating that the basal Erk activity interferes with differentiation to PE. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of RasLeu-61 on PKA-induced PE differentiation was completely abolished by PD98059 (Fig.6 A) and could be mimicked by Raf-CAAX and MEK-D218/222 (Fig.6 B). Together these data strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of Ras on PE differentiation is mediated by Erk and that down-regulation of the Erk activity in PrE-like F9 cells is necessary but not sufficient for PE differentiation to occur. One of the first differentiation processes during mouse embryogenesis takes place in the blastocyst around day 4.5 postcoitus. Cells of the inner cell mass differentiate into PrE, which subsequently differentiates into PE. The signals involved in this two-step process are poorly understood. F9 EC cells are a suitable in vitromodel system to study the formation of PrE and PE. However, lack of proper PrE- and/or PE-specific markers made a good distinction between PrE or PE difficult in the past. In this study we made use of antibodies against thrombomodulin, a suitable marker for PE (6Imada M. Imada S. Iwasaki H. Kume A. Yamaguchi H. Moore E.E. Dev. Biol. 1987; 122: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 7Weiler-Guettler H. Aird W.C. Rayburn H. Husain M. Rosenberg R.D. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2271-2281PubMed Google Scholar), to distinguish between PrE and PE. We show that both differentiation processes are regulated by the Ras/Erk pathway, since expression of constitutively active forms of Ras, Raf, and MAP kinase kinase in F9 EC cells induced differentiation toward a PrE-like phenotype, while they inhibited the subsequent differentiation toward PE. Accordingly, RA-mediated PrE differentiation was accompanied by an increase in endogenous Ras and Erk activity, while subsequent PTH-mediated PE differentiation was accompanied by a decrease in endogenous Ras and Erk activity. Expression of oncogenic Ha-Ras in F9 EC cells has been reported to induce differentiation toward an endoderm-like phenotype (34Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Satake M. Murakami Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8670-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that this Ras-induced phenotype resembles PrE and not PE. Importantly, also when expressed in embryonic stem (E14) cells, which can be differentiated in vitro to form derivatives of all three germ layers, oncogenic Ras induces a PrE-like morphology and expression of Troma-1. 3M. H. G. Verheijen and M. J. Goumans, unpublished results. This indicates that Ras/Erk-mediated PrE differentiation is not only restricted to the F9 EC system, but a more general feature for embryonic stem and embryonic carcinoma cells (Fig.7). Ras activity is up-regulated during RA-induced PrE differentiation, again suggesting an important role for Ras in mediating PrE differentiation. The mechanism of Ras activation by RA is unclear. RA-induced PrE differentiation is accompanied by expression of growth factors and/or their receptors, such as platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, and transforming growth factor (43Mummery C.L. van den Eijnden-van Raaij A.J.M. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44Rizzino A. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 61-65PubMed Google Scholar), and thus RA might elevate Ras activity by establishing autocrine stimulation of these receptors. Expression of RasAsn-17, to interfere with RA-induced Ras activation, did not affect RA-induced PrE differentiation. However, the inhibition of RA-induced Ras activation might have been incomplete, as indicated by residual RA-induced Erk activation in the presence of RasAsn-17 (data not shown). Nevertheless, while PD98059 completely inhibited RasLeu-61- and RA-induced Erk activation in EC cells, only the Ras-induced and not the RA-induced PrE differentiation was blocked. This is in apparent contrast with the findings of Gao et al. (35Gao P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9002-9008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), who, using antisense p42 MAP kinase oligonucleotides, found an inhibition of RA-induced expression of the differentiation marker tPA. We observed, however, that complete inhibition of p42 MAP kinase by PD98059 had no effect on RA-induced PrE-like morphology, expression of Troma-1, or on subsequent PTH-induced PE differentiation (data not shown). Thus, RA induces PrE differentiation via a Ras/Erk-independent pathway as well. A possible target of RA and Ras involved in PrE differentiation is AP-1, a transcription factor family consisting of homo- or heterodimers of Jun, Fos, or ATF proteins, which can be activated via Ras-dependent and Ras-independent pathways (45Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Both RA as well as oncogenic Ras induce c-jun expression in EC cells (34Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

New Biol. 1990; 2: 351-361PubMed Google Scholar), while forced expression of c-fos or c-jun in EC cells is sufficient to induce differentiation (34Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Satake M. Murakami Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8670-8674Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 47Yang-Yen H.F. Chiu R. Karin M.

Kruijer W. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1837-1990Google Scholar). The role of AP-1 activation in RA- and Ras-induced PrE differentiation is currently being investigated. It should be stressed here that the identity of the factor(s) establishing primitive endoderm differentiation in vivo is unclear. Although RA efficiently induces differentiation of F9 EC cellsin vitro, its involvement in this differentiation processin vivo is rather unlikely (50Rossant J. Zirngibl R. Cado M. Shago M. Giguère V. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 51Clifford J. Chiba H. Subieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P.

Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 313-326PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that the Ras/Erk pathway has the capacity to regulate PrE and PE differentiation in vitro suggests that it could play a major role in the regulatory mechanisms governing extraembryonic endoderm differentiation in vivo. Treatment of PrE-like F9 cells with PTHrP, besides inducing activation of PKA, also induces an elevation of intracellular calcium levels (data not shown). Here we show for the first time that a strong increase in PKA activity is sufficient to induce PE differentiation, suggesting that PTHrP-induced PE differentiation can be mediated solely through PKA activation. We recently reported that the PTH-induced PKA activation is sufficient to inhibit both basal as well as growth factor-induced activation of Erk (14Verheijen M.H.G. Defize L.H.K. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3331-3337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we show that PTH and Bt2cAMP also inhibit Erk activity in RA-treated F9 cells. It was demonstrated in other cells that activation of PKA interfered with Erk activation at the level of Raf-1, leaving Ras activity unaffected (30Burgering B.M.T. Pronk G.J. van Weeren P.C. Chardin P. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4211-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our data however demonstrate that in PrE-like F9 cells cAMP elevation inhibits Ras activity. We observed a strong correlation between the reduction in Ras and Erk activity, suggesting that the cAMP-induced Erk inhibition is a consequence of the inhibition of Ras activity. The mechanism involved in the inhibition of Ras activity by cAMP remains to be determined. This could be mediated via interference with growth factor-induced Ras activation or via inhibition of RasGAP (Ras GTPase activation protein), for instance by PKA-induced phosphorylation (54Izawa I. Tamaki N. Saya H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In agreement with an inhibitory role for Ras in PE differentiation, it has been reported that Ras is expressed at very low levels in PE during early rat embryogenesis (55Brewer L.M. Brown N.A. Anat. Rec. 1992; 234: 443-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Ras or Erk activation with RasAsn-17 or PD98059, respectively, was by itself not sufficient to induce PE differentiation, suggesting that other events apart from inhibition of Ras activity are involved in cAMP-mediated PE differentiation as well. Inhibition of Erk activity did however enhance PKA-induced PE differentiation, suggesting that the basal Erk activity in PrE-like cells interferes with differentiation of these cells to PE. This is in agreement with the observation that sustained elevation of Erk activity by expression of constitutive active Ras, Raf, or MAP kinase kinase prevents PE differentiation, even when induced by cPKA. In conclusion, our data suggest the following model for endoderm differentiation of F9 cells (Fig. 7). Activation of the Ras/Erk pathway is sufficient to trigger differentiation to PrE. RA induces activation of the Ras/Erk pathway and accordingly differentiation to PrE. However, RA induces PrE differentiation via an Erk-independent pathway as well. The sustained Ras/Erk activity in PrE-like cells blocks signal(s) inducing the subsequent differentiation toward PE. This Ras activity is down-regulated by PTHrP via PKA, resulting in disappearance of the blockade and transmission of the signal(s) triggering PE differentiation. According to this model, one can speculate that differentiation of PrE and PE in the early mouse embryo is tightly regulated by a subtle cross-talk between (extracellular) signals leading to Ras/Erk activation and signals such as PTHrP, leading to PKA activation.

These noncatalytic domains target the proteins to specific phosphotyrosyl peptide sequences within their binding partners, thereby regulating a wide range of intracellular signaling events. The specificity of this interaction is determined by the amino acid sequence surrounding the phosphotyrosine on the one hand and by the SH2 domain on the other (3Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birch R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). Activation of transcription factors of the STAT family has been shown to require the transient association of the STATs with cytokine receptors (4Fu X.Y. Zhang J.J.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). STAT factors interact through their SH2 domains with specific phosphotyrosine motifs within the cytoplasmic parts of the activated receptors. In the case of the activation of STAT1 and STAT3 by interleukin-6, four such tyrosine motifs within the interleukin-6 signal-transducing receptor subunit gp130 have been identified (6Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Two of these motifs (Y767RHQ and Y814FKQ) give rise to specific STAT3 activation, whereas two others (Y905LPQ and Y915MPQ) are able to recruit both STAT1 and STAT3 (6Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J.

Subsequent to receptor binding, the STAT factors are phosphorylated on a single tyrosine residue by receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the Janus kinase family (8Lütticken C. Wegenka U.M.

This activation of the STAT factors leads to homo- or heterodimerization and translocation to the nucleus, where they bind to enhancers of interleukin-6-inducible genes resulting in the activation of transcription of, e.g.acute phase protein genes (11Wegenka U.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 1121-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The dimerization of STAT factors has also been shown to be mediated by the SH2 domains (9Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell J.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). This has been confirmed recently by x-ray structures of the STAT1 and STAT3 dimers bound to DNA (14Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 15Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). In this complex the two SH2 domains form a tunnel that is passed by the two phosphotyrosine-containing tail segments. Previous experiments have shown that the SH2 domain is also the sole determinant of specific STAT factor activation via gp130 and the interferon-γ receptor (16Hemmann U. Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Kurapkat G. Grötzinger J. Wollmer A. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 267: 1347-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The mechanism for the binding of STAT monomers to the phosphotyrosine-containing recruitment sites of the cytoplasmic region of signal-transducing receptor subunits still needs to be elucidated. Here we describe the expression, refolding, and structural characterization of the STAT3-SH2 domain as well as its specific binding to phosphotyrosine peptides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this interaction requires a monomeric domain. Biotinylated peptides were synthesized as described earlier (18Reineke U. Sabat R. Kramer A. Stigler R.D. Seifert M. Michel T. Volk H.D. Schneider-Mergener J. Mol. Diversity. 1996; 1: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Constructions were carried out using standard procedures (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For construction of pB-STAT3-BS, the cDNA encoding murine STAT3 (kindly supplied by J. Darnell, Jr., Rockefeller University, New York) was provided with BglII andSalI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and cloned into a pBluescript vector (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). The sequence encoding the STAT3-SH2 domain (amino acid residues 582–702) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, andBamHI and AvrII restriction sites were introduced by the 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. TheBamHI/AvrII DNA fragment was ligated with a modified pRSet5c vector carrying an adaptor consisting of an amino-terminal MRGS(H)6-tag and a BamHI and anAvrII restriction site. The resulting vector pRSetS3SH2 coding for the amino-terminally His-tagged STAT3-SH2 domain was verified by DNA sequence analysis. Escherichia colistrain BL21(DE3)pLysS transformed with the pRSetS3SH2 plasmid was grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) and ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to an A 595of 0.6–0.7. Cells were induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C and subsequently harvested by centifugation. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (26 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol), cells were lysed by repeated freezing and thawing, and the inclusion bodies were harvested by centrifugation and purified by five cycles of sonication (constant pulse for 2 min at 0 °C), each followed by centrifugation at 3,700 rpm for 30 min. The inclusion bodies were solubilized in buffer S (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 m GdnHCl, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation at 42 °C for 30 min, insoluble particles were removed by filtration through a 0.45-μm sterile filter, and the buffer pH was adjusted to 2. The denatured STAT3-SH2 domain was purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Polygosil 60-5 C18 column (CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) equilibrated in buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Elution of the STAT3-SH2 domain occurred at 50.3% buffer B (80% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). The purified protein was isolated by lyophilization and solubilized in buffer S. Refolding of the purified SH2 domain was achieved by dialysis at 4 °C against different buffers (buffer C: 20 mmNa2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol; buffer D: 20 mmNa2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 5.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA; buffer E: 20 mm CH3COONa/CH3COOH, pH 4.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA). For purity determination, the proteins were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE and visualized using SyproTM Orange protein stain reagent (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The quantitative analysis was performed on a Storm 840 fluorescence scanner (Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld, Germany) using Image QuantTM software. The harvested cell fragments containing the inclusion bodies were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) using a semidry electroblotting apparatus. STAT3-SH2 detection was performed using a monoclonal MRGSHis antibody (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). A polyclonal goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) was used to visualize the immunoreactive bands by Western blot techniques. Peptide binding of the isolated pure STAT3-SH2 domain was performed by the means of an ELISA. A 96-well ELISA Maxisorb plate (NUNC, Roskilde, Denmark) was coated with 2.5 μg/ml streptavidin (100 μl/well; 16 h at room temperature). Unoccupied binding sites were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mmNa2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl) (200 μl/well; 2 h at room temperature). After four washings with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.02%Tween (200 μl/well), the biotinylated peptides were immobilized by incubating the streptavidin surface with 100 μl/well of a 500 ng/ml peptide solution in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were washed four times with 200 μl/well phosphate-buffered saline and 0.02% Tween, and the surface was equilibrated with buffer C or D. STAT3-SH2 solutions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and unbound protein was removed by washing four times with the appropriate phosphate buffer. The unoccupied phosphotyrosine residues were detected by incubation with PY20 phosphotyrosine antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY; 1:2,000, 100 μl/well) for 45 min at room temperature. Bound PY20 was visualized using a polyclonal goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (DAKO; 1:2,000, 100 μl/well, 45 min at room temperature). Staining reagent was 0.1 mg/ml 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in 0.1 m acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.003 vol % H2O2. The reaction was stopped with 2 m sulfuric acid. Inhibition of the PY20/phosphopeptide interaction by STAT3-SH2 was determined by calculating the decrease in absorbance with increasing amounts of STAT3-SH2 relative to a SH2-free sample. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a Bio-SilectTM SEC 125–5 column (Bio-Rad). The column was equilibrated with the refolding buffer C (pH 7.5) or D (pH 5.5), respectively, loaded with 500 μl of STAT3-SH2 (70–80 μg/ml), and run at a constant flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. The collected 0.7-ml fractions were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver staining. CD measurements were carried out on an AVIV (Lakewood, NJ) 62DS CD spectrometer, equipped with a temperature control unit, and a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter, both calibrated with a 0.1% aqueous solution ofd-10-camphorsulfonic acid according to Chen and Yang (20Chen G.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Lett. 1977; 10: 1195-1207Crossref Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The spectral band width was 1.5 nm. The time constant ranged between 1 and 4 s and the cell path length between 0.1 and 10 mm. Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Spex Fluorolog 211 photon-counting spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries, NY) with a band width of 2.7 nm (excitation monochromator) and 2.2 nm (emission monochromator). The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. The spectra are corrected for changes in lamp intensity and for spectral sensitivity of the emission-monochromator/photomultiplier system. All fluorescence measurements were carried out at 20 °C. Fluorescence lifetimes and anisotropy decay were measured in the single photon-counting mode with an Edinburgh Instruments Ltd. (U. K.) spectrometer, model 199. The full width at half maximum of the lamp pulse from the hydrogen flashlamp was 1.4 ns. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm and the band width 8 nm. The emitted light was passed through a combination of a UV-transmitting black glass and a cutoff glass filter to create a band pass (WG320, DUG11, Schott, Mainz, Germany). At least 80,000 counts were accumulated in the peak channel of the total fluorescence intensity, I(t). The lamp pulse was recorded with a suspension of Ludox (NEN Life Science Products) at 345 nm. Data handling and the iterative nonlinear least squares fit of the decays were accomplished with a program supplied by Edinburgh Instruments Ltd. Intensity decays (I(t)) were fit to the multiexponential model using I(t) = ∑biexp(−t/τi), where bi values are the amplitudes associated with the decay time τi. The fractional intensity Bj =bjτj/∑biτi permits calculation of the mean lifetime <τ> = ∑Biτi. Fluorescence anisotropy decays were analyzed by an exponential fit. r(t)=rexp(−t/φ)+r∞where r 0 = r +r∞. The parameters of r(t) are as follows.r is the anisotropy; φ, the rotational correlation time;r 0 and r ∞ are the limiting anisotropies, r(t)(t → 0) = r 0 andr(t)(t → ∞) =r ∞. The quality of the fits was gathered from plots of weighted residuals and from the statistical parameter χ2 (21Szabo A.G. Rayner D.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 554-563Crossref Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were calculated from absorption spectra in the range of 240–320 nm using the method of Waxman et al. (22Waxman E. Rusinova E. Hasselbacher C.A. Schwartz G.P. Laws W.R. Ross J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To obtain sufficient amounts of protein, the amino-terminally His-tagged STAT3-SH2 domain was expressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein was found entirely in inclusion bodies (Fig.1 A). Repeated sonication and centrifugation yielded inclusion bodies containing about 90% STAT3-SH2 protein. 1 liter of medium contained 40–50 mg of inclusion body proteins. After solubilization of the inclusion bodies in GdnHCl the proteins were separated on a reverse phase HPLC column, and STAT3-SH2-containing peak fractions were lyophilized. The STAT3-SH2 protein proved to be at least 99% pure (Fig. 1 B). This procedure yielded 10–15 mg of pure STAT3-SH2/liter of culture. The purified protein was dissolved in 6 m GdnHCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed for refolding against buffers of pH 7.5, 5.5, and 4.5, respectively. Subsequently the protein samples were characterized by CD spectroscopy. Fig.2 shows the far UV and near UV CD spectra of the STAT3-SH2 domain at pH 7.5 (solid line) and pH 4.5 (dashed line). Although the far UV CD spectra are remarkably different at the two pH values, they look similar to spectra of other SH2 domains (23Panayotou G. Bax B. Gout I. Federwisch M. Wroblowski B. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Blundell T.L. Wollmer A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4261-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Shoelson S.E. Sivaraja M. Williams K.P. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Weiss M.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Even more pronounced differences were detected between the near UV CD spectra at the two different pH values (Fig.2 B). For instance, at pH 4.5 a distinct band appeared at 292 nm which can be assigned to a tryptophan residue. This effect can be attributed to a local change rather than to a change of the overall fold of the protein. The reversibility of this structural change was determined by changing the pH of the solution from pH 4.5 to 7.5 and vice versa (data not shown). To determine the thermal stability of the folded proteins at the different pH values we recorded a series of CD spectra with increasing temperature. At pH 7.5 a melting curve with a midpoint around 43 °C was obtained (Fig. 3). At pH 4.5, however, the protein precipitated with increasing temperature (data not shown). Because the thermal stability of the protein could only be estimated at pH 7.5, we monitored the GdnHCl-induced unfolding of the protein by fluorescence spectroscopy at pH 4.5, 5.5, and 7.5. With increasing GdnHCl concentration the fluorescence intensity decreased (not shown), and the maximum of the tryptophan emission shifted from 333 to 353 nm at pH 5.5. This behavior is characteristic of a transition of a protein from a folded to an unfolded state. Whereas the midpoint of the denaturation curve at pH 7.5 (Fig. 4, solid line) was found at about 1.7 m GdnHCl, this point is shifted to 2.1m GdnHCl at acidic pH values of 5.5 (dotted line) and 4.5 (dashed line). Steady-state fluorescence, fluorescence lifetime, and anisotropy decay measurements were performed at pH 7.5, 5.5, and 4.5. The steady-state fluorescence data of the SH2 domain upon excitation at 295 nm are compiled in TableI. With a pH decrease from 7.5 to 4.5, the maximum of the emission band shifted from 336 to 330. This shift was accompanied by a decrease of the full width at half maximum from 56 to 51 nm. The shift of the emission maximum and the decrease of the full width at half maximum are indicative of an increasingly hydrophobic environment of the sole tryptophan present in the SH2 domain.Table IFluorescence-steady state data of the STAT3-SH2 domain at different pH valuespHλmaxFWHMnmnm7.5336565.5334534.533051λmax is the wavelength of the maximum tryptophan fluorescence.

FWHM is the full width at half maximum The results of the fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy decay measurements are compiled in Tables II and III. The decays of the tryptophan fluorescence can be fitted by a sum of three exponentials with fractional intensities Bi and corresponding lifetimes τi and lead to calculated mean lifetimes (<τ>) of 4.7, 4.1, and 3.7 ns for the pH values of 7.5, 5.5, and 4.5, respectively (Table II). Such a behavior is in good agreement with the blue shift of the emission maximum in Table I (25Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar).Table IIFluorescence intensity decay data of the STAT3-SH2 domain at different pH valuespHB 1B 2B 3τ1τ2τ3χ2τnsnsnsns7.50.190.640.171.344.549.251.414.75.50.180.590.231.053.557.611.104.14.50.170.620.210.943.317.151.233.7B i is the fractional amplitude associated with the decay time τi; 〈τ〉 is the mean lifetime (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Open table in a new tab B i is the fractional amplitude associated with the decay time τi; 〈τ〉 is the mean lifetime (see “Experimental Procedures”). r i are the anisotropies, Φ the rotational correlation time (see “Experimental Procedures”). The fluorescence anisotropy decays of the SH2 domain at different pH values were fitted with one exponential and led to rotational correlation times of Φ = 12.4, 6.4, and 6.1 ns at pH values of 7.5, 5.5, and 4.5, respectively (Table III). Rotational correlation times Φ can be used to calculate the molecular mass from the equation M r = f × Φ (f = 2.6 kDa/ns) for spherical particles on the basis of the Stokes-Einstein relationship (26Leenders H.R. Vervoort J. van Hoek A. Visser A.J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1990; 18: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The expected rotational correlation time Φ for a monomeric SH2 domain is therefore about 5.7 ns assuming a spherical shape. The measured rotational correlation times at acidic pH values are in good agreement with the overall tumbling rate expected for a monomer. The twice as high value found at neutral pH indicates the existence of a dimeric SH2 domain. The reversibility of the monomer/dimer transition was determined by changing the pH from 4.5 to 7.5 and vice versa by dialysis (data not shown). Additional evidence for the dimerization was provided by size exclusion chromatography experiments (Fig. 5) using a calibrated column. Fig.5 A shows the elution profile of the SH2 domain (monomer,dotted line; dimer, solid line). Both peaks contain STAT3-SH2 as shown by SDS-PAGE (see inset in Fig.5 A). The apparent molecular masses of both the monomer (13 kDa) and the dimer (32 kDa) are in good agreement with the expected values (Fig. 5 B) of 15 and 30 kDa, respectively. To determine the functionality of the recombinant STAT3-SH2 domain, we worked out an ELISA using biotinylated phosphopeptides as bait. Based on previous investigations, we chose all of the phosphopeptide motifs of the signal transducer gp130, a mutant of the pY767 motif containing a Q/E exchange at the pY+3 position (pYQ770E) as well as the phosphotyrosine motif encompassing pY705 of STAT3 or a peptide containing the amino acids of the gp130 motif pY767 in random order (pYX) (Table IV). As the STAT3-SH2 domain turned out to undergo a pH-dependent dimerization, we investigated the specificity of the interaction with the various phosphopeptide motifs under neutral (dimer) and acidic (monomer) conditions. For the interaction of the peptides with the monomeric SH2 domain, we performed the assay at pH 5.5 to maintain the stability of streptavidin.Table IVBiotinylated peptides used in the ELISAPeptideOrigin and Y locationSequencepY683gp130-Y683Biotin-βA-NSKDQMpYSDGNFTDpY759gp130-Y759Biotin-βA-TSSTVQpYSTVVHSGpY767gp130-Y767Biotin-βA-TVVHSGpYRHQVPSVpY814gp130-Y814Biotin-βA-ILPRQQpYFKQNCSQpY905gp130-Y905Biotin-βA-EGMPKSpYLPQTVRQpY915gp130-Y915Biotin-βA- PQTVRQGGpYMPQpYQ770E(gp130-Y767)Biotin-βA-TVVHSGpYRHEVPSVpY705STAT3-Y705Biotin-βA- PGSAAPpYLKTKFIpYXBiotin-βA-QPVRSHVpYSVTGVH Open table in a new tab Fig. 6 shows a schematic representation of the ELISA used. After incubation of the biotinylated phosphopeptides with the streptavidin-coated surface, the immobilized phosphotyrosine residues were detected with the phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 (Fig.6 A). Incubation with increasing amounts of STAT3-SH2 led to a decrease in absorbance because PY20 was unable to recognize the phosphopeptides bound to the SH2 domain (Fig. 6 B). The relative decrease in absorbance with increasing amounts of STAT3-SH2 compared with an SH2-free sample was used to determine the inhibition of the PY20/phosphopeptide interaction by STAT3-SH2 which indicates SH2/peptide binding. Fig. 7 A shows the inhibition of the PY20/phosphopeptide interaction at pH 5.5. The STAT3-SH2 domain interacts specifically with the four-membrane distal phosphotyrosine motifs of gp130 (pY767, pY814, pY905, and pY915) whereas the peptides pY683 and pYX as well as the pY759 motif, known to bind to the SH2 domain of SHP-2, show only weak binding. In addition, the isolated STAT3-SH2 domain binds to the motif pY705 of STAT3. Interestingly, the binding of the SH2 domain to pY767 is significantly impaired by a Q/E exchange at the pY+3 position (pYQ770E). This emphasizes the importance of the pY+3 position for specific recognition of receptor motifs by STAT3-SH2. Fig. 7 B shows the results of the same experiment under neutral buffer conditions (pH 7.5) where the SH2 domain exists as a dimer. Whereas the monomeric SH2 domain is able to distinguish between the different phosphopeptides, the dimeric molecule is not. The phosphopeptides show only low affinity to the dimer. The SH2 domains of the STAT factors are involved in receptor recognition as well as in their dimerization. Dimerization is induced by tyrosine phosphorylation and is a prerequisite for DNA binding. To investigate the interaction of the SH2 domains with the respective phosphotyrosine motifs on a molecular level we expressed the SH2 domain of STAT3 in E. coli. After purification the protein was refolded. CD spectra of the refolded protein correspond to those observed with other SH2 domains (23Panayotou G. Bax B. Gout I. Federwisch M. Wroblowski B. Dhand R. Fry M.J. Blundell T.L. Wollmer A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4261-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 24Shoelson S.E. Sivaraja M. Williams K.P. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Weiss M.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Spectral differences were observed at neutral and acidic pH. The changes seen in the far UV are a reflection of limited rearrangements of the overall structure (Fig. 2). The near UV spectrum, for instance, shows a distinct band at 292 nm at pH 4.5 which is not detectable at pH 7.5, indicating a loss in conformational mobility for the side chain of the sole tryptophan. This result correlates well with the corresponding fluorescence spectra where a blue shift of the emission maximum and a decrease of the full width at half maximum are observed with decreasing pH, reflecting a transition of the sole tryptophan from a hydrophilic to a more hydrophobic environment. The fluorescence anisotropy decay measurements enabled us to assign these spectral differences to a pH-dependent dimerization of the recombinant SH2 domain which exists as a monomer under acidic conditions and as a dimer at neutral pH. The less exposed tryptophan in the monomeric state correlates with a higher stability of the monomer compared with the dimer as revealed by GdnHCl-induced denaturation. Thus, the small structural changes induced by dimerization are accompanied by a destabilization of the molecule. Taken together, the fluorescence and CD measurements show that dimerization leads to a conformational change in the SH2 domain involving tryptophan 623. In the x-ray structure of the (STAT1)2-DNA complex the corresponding tryptophan is located at the surface of the molecule and is accessible to water. The higher B factors of this amino acid residue in the crystal structure are a further indication of its enhanced flexibility in the dimer. For other SH2 domains such as those of Src or Lck kinase it has been shown that the BG loop is attached to the body of the molecule (27Waksman G. Kominos D. Robertson S.C. Pant N. Baltimore D. Birge R.B. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Mayer B.J. Overduin M. Resh M.D. Rios C.B. Silverman L. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1992; 358: 646-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 28Eck M.J. Atwell S.K. Shoelson S.E. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1994; 368: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), whereas it is completely detached in the (STAT3)2-DNA and (STAT1)2-DNA complexes (14Chen X. Vinkemeier U. Zhao Y. Jeruzalmi D. Darnell J.E. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1998; 93: 827-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 15Becker S. Groner B. Müller C.W. Nature. 1998; 394: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Because the BG loop is also involved in the dimer interface we raise the idea that in the monomeric state this loop resembles the situation seen in other SH2 domains. This would bury the tryptophan (Trp623) within the structure, a fact that we indeed observe for the monomeric SH2 domain. The two conformational states might reflect different modes of SH2/phosphotyrosine peptide interactions in STAT receptor binding and STAT dimer formation. Recently, heterodimeric complexes of STAT1 with STAT2 or STAT3 prior to cytokine stimulation have been described (29Stancato L.F. David M. Carter-Su C. Larner A.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4134-4137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The ability of the STAT3-SH2 domain to form dimers may reflect such an interaction between unphosphorylated STAT molecules. On the other hand, it cannot be ruled out that the observed dimerization is a property of the isolated domain and that its formation is prevented within the entire protein. To study the interaction of the STAT3-SH2 domain with different phosphotyrosine peptides we established an ELISA based on the competition of a phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody with the recombinant protein in binding to phosphotyrosine peptide motifs. Whereas the monomeric STAT3-SH2 domain was able to bind to specific phosphotyrosine peptides no such interaction could be observed with the dimeric protein. We detected a specific interaction between the monomeric STAT3-SH2 domain and the four distal phosphotyrosine motifs present in the cytoplasmic part of the signal transducer gp130. In contrast, the phosphotyrosine peptides corresponding to the two membrane-proximal tyrosine residues did not show a specific interaction (Fig. 7). These results are in good agreement with the previous observation that in transiently transfected COS cells STAT3 is activated only through the four distal tyrosine motifs of gp130 (6Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol.

Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found a Q770E substitution in the Y767 motif of gp130 to lead to a loss in STAT3-SH2 binding, corroborating the finding that a glutamine residue at the Y+3 position is important for STAT3 activation (Fig. 7). Thus, our STAT3-SH2/phosphopeptide interaction studies fully confirmed the results obtained with native STAT3 in COS cells. Furthermore, the phosphotyrosine peptide of STAT3 itself (pY705) showed specific binding to the recombinant STAT3-SH2 domain. A comparison of the affinities would require a common binding mechanism. As deduced from the x-ray structure of the (STAT1)2-DNA and (STAT3)2-DNA complexes the mode of SH2/peptide binding therein shows fundamental differences to SH2/peptide interactions known so far (2Cohen G.B. Ren R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1995; 80: 237-248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). An expected higher affinity to the phosphotyrosine peptide of STAT3 itself (pY705) compared with receptor motifs was not observed. This is presumably because the complex interaction seen in the x-ray structures cannot be reconstituted in the ELISA. Thus far, structure/function studies of recombinant STAT-SH2 domains were hampered by the fact that they did not show specific binding to phosphotyrosine peptides. We found that at physiological pH the recombinant STAT3-SH2 domain is forming dimers that do not bind to phosphopeptides. The observation that under acidic conditions, the STAT3-SH2 domain exists as a monomer that specifically binds to phosphotyrosine motifs will enable us to elucidate how STAT factors interact with their receptors.

The S100s are a group of proteins that belong to the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family (1Kretsinger R.H. Nockolds C.E. J. Biol.

This family includes such mechanistically well understood proteins as the calcium-dependent muscle sensor troponin-C, the ubiquitous enzyme regulator calmodulin, and the visual signaling molecule recoverin. Signaling by these molecules is controlled through calcium binding to the EF-hand protein and subsequent induction of a conformational change that modifies protein-protein interactions with a target protein. For example, troponin-C undergoes a calcium-induced conformational change, allowing a strengthening of its interactions with a second member of the troponin complex, troponin-I (4McKay R.T.

An analogous mechanism has been proposed for several S100 proteins, allowing them to control such diverse processes as protein phosphorylation, cytoskeletal protein assembly, neurite outgrowth, and cell cycle regulation through a variety of calcium-sensitive interactions with other proteins (3Schafer B.W.

S100B (an S100 dimer composed of two S100β monomers) is one member of the S100 protein family for which several potential cellular targets have been identified. For example, polymerization of cellular architecture molecules such as glial fibrillary acidic protein and tubulin can be inhibited through a calcium-dependent interaction with S100B (8Donato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 106-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bianchi R. Giambanco I. Donato R. J. Biol.

Alternatively, S100B can inhibit the phosphorylation of proteins such as myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (11Lin L.-H. Van Eldik L.J. Osheroff N. Norden J.J. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the Alzheimer protein Tau (12Baudier J. Cole R.D. J. Biol.

This action is different from that of the S100 protein S100A12, which has been shown to inhibit phosphorylation of the myosin protein kinase twitchin through interaction with its regulatory region (16Heierhorst J. Kobe B. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. Benian G.M. Weiss K.R. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1996; 380: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in a fashion reminiscent of calmodulin's action with myosin light chain kinase (17Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). In order to clarify potential target proteins, a bacteriophage random peptide library has recently been used to define a recognition sequence for S100B (18Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These studies showed that a 12-residue sequence containing the consensus motif (K/R)(L/I)XWXXIL was sufficient to bind to S100B in a calcium-sensitive manner. Further studies have shown this peptide (TRTK-12) successfully competes with other proteins such as glial fibrillary acidic protein and CapZ for calcium-sensitive S100B binding (10Bianchi R. Garbuglia M. Verzini M. Giambanco I. Ivanenkov V.V. Dimlich R.V.W. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 18Ivanenkov V.V.

Similar approaches have identified several 15-residue sequences, analogous to the sequences for myosin light chain kinase, melittin, and mastoparan, as representative samples of the calcium-dependent target proteins for calmodulin (19Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Chan H.C. Nelson D.J. Jamieson Jr G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23025-23030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A clear distinction exists between these binding “epitopes” for S100B and calmodulin as the sequences of TRTK-12 and the calmodulin peptides are not related by alignment. However there is a similarity in composition in that both peptides have a preponderance of hydrophobic and basic residues. Recently, NMR spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography have been used to determine the three-dimensional structures of calcium-saturated human (20Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), rat (21Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and bovine S100B (22Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The structures revealed the S100B dimer has two symmetric monomers each comprising two EF-hand calcium binding sites. The N-terminal EF-hand is formed from helices I and II where helix I (and I′ from the other monomer) are integral to the maintenance of the dimer. Likewise the C-terminal calcium binding site (site II) is composed of helices III and IV where helix IV (and IV′) interact at the dimer interface. Calcium binding to S100B has a minimal effect on the conformation of the N-terminal site I but has a pronounced effect on the canonical C-terminal EF-hand. This results in a reorientation of helix III with respect to other helices in the protein (20Smith S.P. Shaw G.S.

Further, it has been observed that a hydrophobic region composed of several residues near the C terminus of helix IV and in the linker between sites I and II is present on the surface of Ca2+-S100B 1The abbreviations used are: Ca2+-S100B, S100β, and -S100A11, calcium-saturated S100B, S100β, and S100A11, respectively; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy. 1The abbreviations used are: Ca2+-S100B, S100β, and -S100A11, calcium-saturated S100B, S100β, and S100A11, respectively; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy. (20Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Based on this structural data, these regions have been proposed to form a possible recognition site for calcium-sensitive protein-protein interactions in S100B. The composition of this site, primarily hydrophobic and acidic residues, is reminiscent of the protein recognition surface in calmodulin (17Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). In addition, the amino acid sequences in the C-terminal helix and linker show the least sequence similarity among the S100 protein family, suggesting a rationale for target protein specificity (3Schafer B.W.

Several groups have reported that some of the S100 proteins including S100B, S100A12, S100A6, S100A11, calgranulin C, and S100A3 are not only calcium-binding proteins but also bind Zn2+with high affinity (26Baudier J.

Gerard D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and calgranulin C (29Dell'Angelica E.C. Schleicher C.H. Santome J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by at least 10-fold. Such an observation is unique in the EF-hand calcium-binding protein family and may indicate a new mode for calcium regulation and signaling in the S100 proteins. The impact of these observations was recently demonstrated for the giant protein kinase twitchin, where the addition of Zn2+ to calcium-bound S100A12 increased the kinase activation by more than 30-fold over that with calcium alone (16Heierhorst J. Kobe B. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. Benian G.M. Weiss K.R. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1996; 380: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). With this in mind, the current work studies the interaction of the 12-residue peptide TRTK-12 with S100B as a function of the divalent metal ions Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+ in order to understand the influence of each metal ion on TRTK-12 binding. We have used the S100 protein S100A11 and an N-terminal peptide from S100B to determine whether, at least in this case, TRTK-12 binding is specific for S100B. Further, we have used NMR spectroscopy and the three-dimensional structure of human Ca2+-S100B to highlight residues that may be important for TRTK-12 interaction. [15N]Phenylalanine, [15N]alanine, Tris-d 11, CH3CO2Na-d 3, and deuterium oxide were obtained from Isotec Inc. (Miamisburg, OH). Calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, and zinc chloride were all puratronic grade from Alfa-Aesar (Mississauga, Canada). All other chemicals used were of the highest purity commercially available.

The backbone amides of alanine and phenylalanine residues of S100B were selectively 15N-labeled and purified as described previously (33Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol.

The hs1bI peptide (residues 1–46) from human S100B (SELEKAMVALIDVFHQYSGREGDKHKLKKSELKELINNELSHFLEE) was custom synthesized by Chiron Mimotopes (Clayton, Victoria, Australia) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)chemistry and purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Spectra were obtained using a Hitachi F-4010 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with a stirred cell holder. Tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm and emission-scanned from 305 to 450 nm using an emission band pass of 5 nm. Titrations of the TRTK-12 peptide with S100B were followed by monitoring the increase in fluorescence at 332.8 nm. The concentrations of the TRTK-12 peptide and S100B stock solutions were determined from absorbance spectra using extinction coefficients of ε280= 5600 cm−1m−1 for TRTK-12 and ε280 = 3400 cm−1m−1 for S100B. Samples of TRTK-12 were typically made in 50 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris buffer at pH 7.2. Additions of S100B or hs1bI were made using 1–2-μl volumes of the proteins in 50 mm KCl, 50 mmTris buffer at pH 7.2 using a calibrated Hamilton 10-μl syringe. Total sample volumes did not change by more than 3%. All NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Unity 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance, pulsed-field gradient probe. Carrier frequencies used were centered at 120.0 (15N) and 4.73 (1H) ppm. One-dimensional1H NMR spectra for TRTK-12 were collected at 25 °C. TRTK-12 (∼1 mg) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 20 mmCD3CO2Na, 50 mm KCl, pH 6.5. Typically, a spectral width of 6000 Hz was used with the transmitter set on the H2O resonance. Water suppression was accomplished during a 2.0-s relaxation delay between transients using a weak presaturation pulse. All spectra were referenced to the trimethylsilyl resonance of sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 0.00 ppm, zero-filled to 65,536 points, and processed using line broadening of 0.5 Hz. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments were acquired on a 0.5 mm S100B sample at 35 °C using the sensitivity-enhanced method (35Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Crossref Scopus (2408) Google Scholar) as described previously (33Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 10: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The calcium-binding protein S100B has been suggested to interact with a variety of cellular targets in a calcium-sensitive fashion. Rather than utilizing a speculative target, we have used a synthetic peptide, TRTK-12, to probe the calcium and zinc-sensitive binding to S100B. With several three-dimensional structures of S100B now in hand, we have used this data to identify potential sites for TRTK-12 interaction with Ca2+-S100B and correlate this with the identification of a potential biological target. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of TRTK-12 is shown in Fig.1 A. The peptide displays an emission maximum at 354 nm for the single Trp7 in the sequence. This wavelength of emission is consistent with the tryptophan located in a polar aqueous environment. For interaction with S100B, this tryptophan provided a convenient marker, since S100B itself contains no tryptophan residues. The addition of two equivalents of apo-S100B to TRTK-12 resulted in a minimal change in the TRTK-12 tryptophan fluorescence, indicating that any interaction between the apo-S100B calcium-binding protein and TRTK-12 is very weak. The addition of physiological levels of Mg2+ (5 mm) to the apo-S100B/TRTK-12 solution had little effect on the tryptophan fluorescence of TRTK-12 despite previous observations that Mg2+ may bind to S100B (36Ogoma Y. Kobayashi H. Fujii T. Kondo Y. Hachimori A. Shimizu T. Hatana M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1992; 14: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast, the addition of saturating amounts of calcium to the apo-S100B/TRTK-12 solution resulted in a 40% enhancement and a blue shift to 332.8 nm for tryptophan fluorescence. These observations are consistent with previous results showing that TRTK-12 is able to interact with the calcium form of S100B (18Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 37Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C.K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2494-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Further, the blue shift indicates the tryptophan residue moves to a more nonpolar environment. S100B has been shown to tightly bind 2 mol of Zn2+ per monomer, and binding of this metal causes a significant change in the surface hydrophobicity of the protein (26Baudier J. Glasser N. Haglid K. Gerard D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, binding of Zn2+ to apo-S100B resulted in little enhancement or shift of the TRTK-12 fluorescence. These observations indicate that calcium is the primary metal responsible for TRTK-12 binding to S100B. To determine whether TRTK-12 fluorescence and binding to Ca2+-S100B could be enhanced or reduced by other metal ions, we examined the additional influences of Mg2+ and Zn2+ on tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of Ca2+-S100B the addition of 5 mmMg2+ had a small negative effect on the fluorescence intensity of TRTK-12. This finding was similar to the observed small effect in Fig. 1 A, where the addition of Mg2+alone had only a weak effect on Trp7 fluorescence. In contrast, the addition of Zn2+ to the Ca2+-S100B solution resulted in an approximate 10% increase in tryptophan fluorescence with no further change in the emission maximum. These results are consistent with Zn2+binding to S100B and enhancement of the interaction of TRTK-12 with Ca2+-S100B. The addition of 5 mmMg2+ to this sample resulted in a small decrease in tryptophan fluorescence similar to that observed in the absence of Zn2+. While the above work and other studies have indicated that TRTK-12 interacts with S100B in a calcium-sensitive manner, the specificity of TRTK-12 for other S100 proteins has not been examined. We investigated this using an S100 protein that has some sequence differences from S100B, especially in the linker and C-terminal regions. S100A11 is an S100 protein (also called S100C) originally isolated from cardiac muscle (34Schonekess B.O. Walsh M.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), which, like S100B, has been shown to bind both Ca2+ and Zn2+ (38Allen B.G. Durussel I. Walsh M.P. Cox J.A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows the tryptophan fluorescence spectra obtained for the addition of Ca2+-S100B and Ca2+-S100A11 to a TRTK-12 solution. The spectra show the characteristic shift in TRTK-12 fluorescence in the presence of Ca2+-S100B. However, the addition of Ca2+-S100A11 yielded little change in the TRTK-12 fluorescence emission wavelength or amplitude, indicating that Ca2+-S100A11 does not perturb TRTK-12 fluorescence. This result is consistent with little or no interaction between TRTK-12 and Ca2+-S100A11. In an effort to localize the region of Ca2+-S100B that interacts with TRTK-12, we studied the effect of a 46-residue peptide comprising a single EF-hand from the N-terminal region of S100B (hs1bI) on TRTK-12 fluorescence. This peptide has been shown to be mostly α-helical by circular dichroism spectroscopy, similar to S100B, and is able to form a tetramer analogous in structure to the arrangement of the four EF-hand motifs in the S100B dimer (39Donaldson C. Barber K.A. Kay C.M. Shaw G.S. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 765-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 D, the addition of hs1bI in the presence of calcium resulted in little change in TRTK-12 fluorescence compared with TRTK-12 alone. This observation indicates that the N terminus of S100B alone is not sufficient to interact with TRTK-12. The interaction of TRTK-12 with Ca2+-S100B was measured by following the tryptophan fluorescence emission at 332.8 nm. Since the previous section showed that TRTK-12 does not interact with apo-S100B, it was important to ensure that Ca2+-S100B was the major populated species during these titrations. To address this, two titrations of TRTK-12 with S100B were done in the presence of differing amounts of excess calcium (1 and 10 mm). Under these conditions and given the calcium dissociation for S100B (∼7–200 μm) (40Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Ca2+-S100B should be the dominant species. Thus, the interaction of TRTK-12 should not be affected by the apo-S100B to Ca2+-S100B equilibrium. Fig.2 shows three representative titrations of TRTK-12 with Ca2+-S100B. Fig. 2 shows that TRTK-12 fluorescence at 332.8 nm increases as a function of added Ca2+-S100B, a result of TRTK-12 binding to Ca2+-S100B. There is excellent agreement between the two curves, indicating that Ca2+-S100B must be the predominant form of the protein at both calcium concentrations and that the interaction of TRTK-12 with Ca2+-S100B is the major event being monitored by these titrations. The shape of the curves does not reveal the stoichiometry of TRTK-12 binding to Ca2+-S100B, which has been suggested to be either 1 or 2 molecules of TRTK-12/S100B dimer (i.e. 1 molecule of TRTK-12/dimer or 1 molecule of TRTK-12 for each S100β monomer) (37Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C.K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2494-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Indeed, fitting of the above data for either a single TRTK-12 or two TRTK-12 molecules binding to Ca2+-S100B yielded very similar results. However, examination of titration data in the presence of Zn2+ or as monitored by NMR spectroscopy (see below) clearly indicated a stoichiometry of 1 TRTK-12 molecule/Ca2+-S100β monomer. A further titration was done using a 40% more dilute TRTK-12 solution. As expected, the change in fluorescence was correspondingly lower, and a subtler hyperbolic curve was obtained. From these data, a dissociation constant of 0.91 ± 0.17 μm for TRTK-12 binding to Ca2+-S100B was determined. Fluorescence experiments shown in Fig. 1 indicated that tryptophan emission of TRTK-12 was enhanced in the presence of both Zn2+ and Ca2+ compared with Ca2+only. To determine whether this was a direct result of increased affinity caused by Zn2+, titrations to determine the binding affinity of TRTK-12 for Ca2+-S100B were done in the presence of Zn2+. As with the previous calcium titration experiments, a Zn2+ concentration of 20-fold the S100β concentration was chosen based on the reported dissociation constants of S100B for Zn2+. The data plotted in Fig. 2 show that Zn2+ binding to S100B in addition to Ca2+increased the response of TRTK-12 toward S100B. From these data, a stoichiometry of 1:1 TRTK-12:S100β monomer is clearly evident. Iterative curve fitting of this data yielded a dissociation constant of 0.18 ± 0.01 for TRTK-12 binding to Zn2+/Ca2+-S100B, an approximate 5-fold tighter binding than to Ca2+-S100B alone. The residues particularly influenced by TRTK-12 binding to Ca2+-S100B were examined by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Fig.3 shows the aromatic, tryptophan indole NH, and methyl regions of a series of 1H NMR spectra of TRTK-12 with increasing amounts of Ca2+-S100B added. The complete assignment of TRTK-12 1H resonances, in the absence of S100B, was accomplished using standard two-dimensional methods (data not shown). In the absence of Ca2+-S100B, the resonances for TRTK-12 were sharp, with 1H chemical shifts close to those representative of a random coil structure. As the concentration of Ca2+-S100B was increased, several of the resonances in TRTK-12 shift and broaden dramatically, while others are less affected. For example the indole NH of Trp7 in TRTK-12 broadens and shifts downfield by 0.25 ppm. In addition, this resonance becomes similar in line width to those observed for other amide resonances in Ca2+-S100B, indicating that this residue now has similar relaxation properties as the Ca2+-S100B protein. The magnitude of the shift of the Trp7 indole NH indicates that the k off for the TRTK-12·Ca2+-S100B complex is on the order of 125 s−1. In the methyl region, Ile5 from TRTK-12 experiences similar line broadening as Trp7 but has a 0.3 ppm upfield chemical shift change. The figure also indicates that line broadening is not consistent for all residues in the TRTK-12 peptide. An interesting observation is the differential changes in Thr1 and Thr3 γ-CH3 groups when Ca2+-S100B is added. In the early additions of Ca2+-S100B, the γ-CH3 group of Thr3 is broadened more so than that of Thr1. Together, these observations provide evidence that the TRTK-12 peptide is binding to Ca2+-S100B. Fluorescence studies showed that the TRTK-12 tryptophan fluorescence was affected very little in the presence of apo-S100B. This was reinforced by 1H-15N HSQC spectra of apo-S100B in the absence and presence of TRTK-12, which indicated the backbone resonances of apo-S100B are not influenced by equimolar amounts of TRTK (data not shown). Qualitatively, this would indicate that the affinity of TRTK-12 for apo-S100B is conservatively 10-fold larger than the apo-S100B concentration (1 mm S100β). In previous work, we determined that calcium binding to S100B results in excessive line broadening, making studies of the Ca2+-S100B species more difficult than apo-S100B. We had shown that this line broadening was a result of aggregation of Ca2+-S100B in the absence of a target protein such as TRTK-12 (32Smith S.P. Barber K.R. Dunn S.D. Shaw G.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8805-8814Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To reduce the possibility of Ca2+-S100B aggregation in this work, we studied the interaction of TRTK-12 with Ca2+-S100B by the addition of incremental amounts of Ca2+ to apo-S100B/TRTK-12 solutions. This yielded identical results compared with direct TRTK-12 addition to Ca2+-S100B. As shown in Fig.4 A, the1H-15N HSQC spectrum of Ca2+-S100B and Ca2+-S100B/TRTK-12 show some significant differences. In particular, the largest changes in the N and NH chemical shifts (weighted average >0.25 ppm) were noted for residues Asp12, Ser41, Phe43, Ile47, Val53, Val56, Thr59, Asp61, Ala78, Ala83, Cys84, Phe87, Phe88, and His90. In the case of alanine and phenylalanine residues, these assignments were confirmed using a specifically 15N-labeled sample (Fig. 4 B). Interestingly, we observed little change in the position of Ile11 upon binding of TRTK-12. This was consistent with observations for binding of a p53 peptide to S100B (41Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) but different from a previous study of TRTK-12 binding to bovine S100B, where Ile11 was observed to undergo the largest shift of any residue (37Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C.K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2494-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The focus of this work was to determine how the interaction of the TRTK-12 binding epitope for S100B varies with metal-ion binding and whether this binding showed a degree of specificity for S100B. These aspects of S100B interaction have not been dealt with in previous studies with TRTK-12. In addition, we have used our data to probe a region on the Ca2+-S100B three-dimensional structure that may be responsible for peptide interaction. The affinity of TRTK-12 for Ca2+-S100B is approximately 1 μm. This value is higher than previously measured in the absence of added salts (0.15 μm) and may reflect a sensitivity of peptide binding to ionic strength which is known to have a significant negative influence on S100B calcium affinity. The magnitude of the TRTK-12 dissociation constant is consistent with those found for other calcium-binding protein-peptide complexes such as TnI peptides binding to skeletal muscle troponin C (24 μm) (4McKay R.T. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28494-28500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and caldesmon peptides binding to calmodulin (1 μm) (42Zhan Q. Wong S.S. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21810-21814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Zhang M. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The interaction of TRTK-12 with S100B is Ca2+-specific, since neither Mg2+ nor Zn2+ binding to S100B could stimulate peptide binding. The finding that Zn2+ binding alone to S100B is unable to promote TRTK-12 binding is in contrast to results using the hydrophobic probe TNS, where a large increase in TNS fluorescence is observed in the presence of Zn2+-S100B (26Baudier J. Glasser N. Haglid K. Gerard D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 27Baudier J. Gerard D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3360-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 44Baudier J. Haglid K. Haiech J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). This observation occurs as a result of the interaction of TNS with the Zn2+form of S100B. Since TNS is known to be a probe for hydrophobic surface rather than a specific binding site, these differences indicate that the hydrophobic surface exposed in S100B by Zn2+ binding is not specific for TRTK-12 binding. In turn, this probably indicates that the protein does not adopt a proper conformation in the Zn2+ form to allow target protein binding. The most dramatic effect on peptide binding to S100B is in the presence of both Zn2+ and Ca2+, where an increase in peptide affinity of about 5-fold is noted compared with the presence of Ca2+ only. This observation is consistent with results for S100A12, where a 30-fold increase in twitchin kinase activity was observed upon the addition of Zn2+ to the calcium form of the protein (16Heierhorst J. Kobe B. Feil S.C. Parker M.W. Benian G.M. Weiss K.R. Kemp B.E. Nature. 1996; 380: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Together with previous observations that S100B is able to bind two Zn2+ ions per monomer (26Baudier J. Glasser N. Haglid K. Gerard D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 790: 164-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,44Baudier J. Haglid K. Haiech J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 114: 1138-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) this indicates that binding of TRTK-12 is enhanced by Zn2+ binding to S100B in the presence of Ca2+only. Since TRTK-12 does not appear to bind to Zn2+-S100B as judged by the present experiments, it would appear the calcium binding to S100B is critical. This indicates that Zn2+plays more of a structural role in proteins such as S100B and S100A12 rather than a regulatory role. Similar proposals have been suggested for the S100 proteins S100A3 (30Fohr U.G. Heizmann C.W. Engelkamp D. Schafer B.W. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21056-21061Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and calgranulin C (29Dell'Angelica E.C. Schleicher C.H. Santome J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, the affinity of Zn2+ for S100B (10−7m) is near the physiological intracellular concentrations of free Zn2+, which are thought to be in the micromolar range. It has been previously proposed that Zn2+ can act as a structural ion in other S100 proteins based on the observation of a His-X 3,4-His pattern found near the C termini (30Fohr U.G. Heizmann C.W. Engelkamp D. Schafer B.W. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21056-21061Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This pattern is similar to that observed for Zn2+-catalytic sites that frequently display a His-X 3-His motif (45Alberts I.A. Nadassy K. Wodak S.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1700-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to note that the three-dimensional structure of human Ca2+-S100B shows that one possible Zn2+ binding site might include residues His85 and His90 based on their proximity in the structure (20Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This region ultimately appears to be important for peptide binding, since several changes in chemical shift and exposed surface area are noted for residues in the C terminus. The measured affinity of TRTK-12 for Ca2+-S100B represents at least a 5-fold increase in affinity compared with that for a 23-residue peptide from the tumor suppressor protein, p53 (residues 367–388) (41Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Further, Zn2+ binding to S100B did not have a notable effect on p53 peptide binding. These observations indicate there are some clear differences between these two peptide species. As indicated by Wilder et al. (15Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the p53 peptide studied previously fits some of the TRTK-12 consensus sequence but lacks residues Ile10 and Leu11. Further, sequence analysis of nine unique p53 sequences from the PIR data base reveals that all forms of p53 do not resemble the TRTK-12 binding motif for these last two residues. 2K. A. McClintock and G. S. Shaw, unpublished results. This may explain the decreased affinity of p53 for S100B. It is intriguing that secondary structure prediction methods show that TRTK-12 should form an amphipathic α-helix between residues Lys4 and Leu11. If this structure exists in the S100B-protein complex, it would place residues Thr3, Trp7, Leu10, and Ile11 on one side of the helix, allowing integral contact of Leu10 and Ile11 with S100B. On the surface, this would provide differences between the interactions of TRTK-12 with Ca2+-S100B compared with p53. The results presented in this work allow an initial overview of the TRTK-12 interaction with Ca2+-S100B previously attempted in the absence of a Ca2+-S100B three-dimensional structure (37Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C.K. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2494-2503Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Residues in the N terminus (Asp12), linker and N terminus of helix III (Ser41, Phe43, Ile47, Val53), and C terminus (Ala78, Ala83, Cys84 and Phe88) undergo the most significant changes in chemical shift upon TRTK-12 binding. Since TRTK-12 has little interaction with the N-terminal peptide, hs1bI, from S100B this would indicate that the linker and C terminus are more important. Using the structure-activity relationship (46Shuker S.B. Hajduk P.L. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1531-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar), it can be proposed that residues change chemical shift as a direct result of interaction with TRTK-12. Fig.5 shows the structure-activity relationship for Ca2+-S100B based on changes in chemical shift. The S100B structure clearly shows these residues comprise a large localized hydrophobic surface on the protein. Further, several residues including Phe43, Ala83, Phe87, and Phe88 are included in or near this region and increase their accessible surface area more than 20% upon calcium binding (20Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with a region for interaction of TRTK-12 with S100B. S100B has been proposed to interact with a large number of potential target proteins including the head domain of glial fibrillary acidic protein that bears some sequence similarity to TRTK-12 (10Bianchi R. Garbuglia M. Verzini M. Giambanco I. Ivanenkov V.V. Dimlich R.V.W. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1313: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Most recently, studies have probed this interaction with p53 (15Wilder P.T. Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 41Rustandi R.R. Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Wilder P.T. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1951-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), guanylate cyclase, and p80 (47Pozdnyakov N. Goraczniak R. Margulis A. Duda T. Sharma R.K. Yoshida A. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14159-14166Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 48Pozdnyakov N. Margulis A. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10701-10708Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). During the course of the current work, a series of synthetic peptides were used to map the regions of S100B that stimulate guanylate cyclase activity and phosphorylation of p80. In agreement with our current findings, these studies indicated that the C-terminal region of S100B encompassing residues Thr81–Glu91 was most effective for guanylate cyclase activation. It was also apparent that residues Leu32–Leu40 could elicit a similar response. This region is just N-terminal to residue Ser41 observed here. Interestingly, our peptide hs1bI (residues 1–46) does not bind to TRTK-12, perhaps suggesting a weaker contribution from the linker region when TRTK-12 is bound and a stronger contribution for guanylate cyclase. Supporting this possibility, it has also been noted that guanylate cyclase does not contain a region similar in sequence to TRTK-12, so this may indicate a fine difference between interaction of S100B and its target proteins.

The human EED protein (HEED) had 99.5% identity with the mouse EED protein and contained seven WD repeats. Two heedgene transcripts were identified, with a putative 407-nucleotide-long intron, giving rise to two HEED protein isoforms of 535 and 494 residues in length, respectively. The shorter HEED isoform, originated from the unspliced message, lacked the seventh WD repeat. HEED was found to bind to MA protein in vitro, as efficiently asin vivo in yeast cells. Site-directed mutagenesis and phage biopanning suggested that the interaction between HEED and MA involved the N-terminal region of the MA protein, including the first polybasic signal, in a MA conformation-dependent manner. In the HEED protein, however, two discrete linear MA-binding motifs were identified within residues 388–403, overlapping the origin of the fifth WD repeat. Deletion of the C-terminal 41 residues of HEED, spanning the seventh WD repeat, as in the 494-residue HEED protein, was detrimental to HEED-MA interaction in vivo, suggesting the existence of another C-terminal binding site and/or a conformational role of the HEED C-terminal domain in the MA-HEED interaction. MA and HEED proteins co-localized within the nucleus of co-transfected human cells and of recombinant baculovirus co-infected insect cells. This and the failure of HEED to bind to uncleaved GAG precursor suggested a role of HEED at the early stages of virus infection, rather than late in the virus life cycle. heed, the human homolog of mouseeed and Drosophila esc, two members of thetrithorax (trx) and Polycomb group (Pc-G) of genes, was isolated by screening an activated lymphocyte cDNA library versus the immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) MA protein used as a bait in a two-hybrid system in yeast.

The shorter HEED isoform, originated from the unspliced message, lacked the seventh WD repeat. HEED was found to bind to MA protein in vitro, as efficiently asin vivo in yeast cells. Site-directed mutagenesis and phage biopanning suggested that the interaction between HEED and MA involved the N-terminal region of the MA protein, including the first polybasic signal, in a MA conformation-dependent manner. In the HEED protein, however, two discrete linear MA-binding motifs were identified within residues 388–403, overlapping the origin of the fifth WD repeat. Deletion of the C-terminal 41 residues of HEED, spanning the seventh WD repeat, as in the 494-residue HEED protein, was detrimental to HEED-MA interaction in vivo, suggesting the existence of another C-terminal binding site and/or a conformational role of the HEED C-terminal domain in the MA-HEED interaction. MA and HEED proteins co-localized within the nucleus of co-transfected human cells and of recombinant baculovirus co-infected insect cells. This and the failure of HEED to bind to uncleaved GAG precursor suggested a role of HEED at the early stages of virus infection, rather than late in the virus life cycle. Multiple structural and physiological functions have been assigned to the matrix (MA) 1The abbreviations used are: MA, matrix; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; CA, capsid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EM, electron microscopy; IEM, immunoelectron microscopy; AD, activation domain; kb, kilobase pair(s); PHA, phytohemagglutinin. of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the protein that constitutes the N-terminal domain (132 amino acids from the initiator methionine) of both GAG (Pr55GAG) and GAG-POL (Pr160GAG-POL) polyprotein precursors (reviewed in Refs. 1Conte M.R.

At late stages of the virus life cycle, the MA protein is a key factor of virion morphogenesis, as it is required for intracellular transport (4Fäcke M. Janetzko A. Shoeman R.L. Kräusslich H.G. J.

At early stages of the infectious cycle, the MA seems to be involved in the infectivity and efficacy of cell entry of the virus (5Yuan X. Yu X. Lee T.H. Essex M. J.

The MA has also been found to be associated with both reverse transcriptase and integrase within the pre-integration complex (18Gallay P. Swingler S. Song J. Bushman F. Trono D. Cell. 1995; 83: 569-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 19Miller M.D. Farnet C.M. Bushman F.D. J.

We have generated a variety of mutations in the gag gene of HIV-1, consisting of insertions, substitutions, or deletions in the different structural domains of the Pr55GAG and expressed the corresponding protein mutants in recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells (21Carrière C.

Lemay P. Masson J.M. Gay B. Boulanger P. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 639-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). One of our C-truncated GAG mutants, carrying an amber mutation at codon 143 in the N-terminal portion of the capsid (CA) domain (GAGamb143; see Ref. 23Chazal N. Gay B. Carrière C. Tournier J. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), corresponds to the MA domain, extended at its C terminus of the first 11 amino acids from the CA. Under its unmyristoylated form (myr−), the recombinant protein of GAGamb143myr(−) showed a trans-dominant negative effect on the plasma membrane targeting and extracellular budding of GAG particles assembled by recombinant wild type Pr55GAG co-expressed in trans in the same Sf9 cells; membrane-enveloped GAG particles were found to accumulate within intracytoplasmic vesicles (23Chazal N. Gay B. Carrière C. Tournier J. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same trans-dominant negative phenotype on wild type Pr55GAG was displayed by the N-myristoylated form of the C-terminally deleted MA, GAGamb120myr(+) (23Chazal N. Gay B. Carrière C. Tournier J. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that recombinant MA proteins expressed by GAGamb143myr(−) and GAG amb120myr(+) competed with some cellular protein partner(s), participating in the GAG precursor transport and/or secretion. In the aim to identify and characterize the cell protein(s) involved in this process, the recombinant MA protein expressed by GAGamb143myr(−), referred to as MA143 in the present study, was used as a molecular bait to screen a cDNA library from activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes in the two-hybrid system in yeast (29Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar). One of the most frequently isolated clones showed a high sequence homology with the mouse gene eed (embryonic ectoderm development; see Ref. 30Shumacher A. Faust C. Magnusson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Murine eed is a highly conserved homolog of the Drosophila esc (extra sex combs) gene, a member of the trithorax (trx) and Polycomb group (Pc-G) of genes, whose products act as silencers of homeotic genes responsible for anterior-posterior patterning during embryogenesis (30Shumacher A. Faust C. Magnusson T. Nature. 1996; 383: 250-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 31Simon J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The product of murine eed has been found to possess a transcriptional repressor activity (32Denisenko O. Bomsztyk C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Phage biopanning and site-directed mutagenesis were used to map the interacting sites of the two molecular partners, HIV-1 MA protein on one hand and humaneed (heed) gene product, the HEED protein, on the other hand. Co-localization of MA and HEED proteins within the nucleus of co-expressing cells, and the absence of detectable interaction between HEED and uncleaved GAG precursor in vivo andin vitro, suggested that HEED and MA would play a role at early stages of the HIV-1 infectious cycle, rather than at late steps, possibly in the process of integration of the provirus into the host-cell genome or of transcriptional regulation of cellular genes. The portion of the HIV-1LAI gag gene coding for the MA and the first 11 residues from the CA domain (MA143), wild type MA132 or MA-derived deletion mutants (MA120 and 132D1 to 132D9), was cloned in frame with the DNA-binding lexA gene into the pBTM116 vector (29Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4879) Google Scholar). The sequence of the construct was verified by DNA sequencing, and the expression of recombinant fusion protein in yeast was confirmed by gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using anti-MA antibody, as described below. The cDNA library was generated by reverse transcription of poly(A)-containing mRNAs isolated from phytohemagglutinin-activated (PHA, 5 μg/ml) peripheral blood lymphocytes, using a 5′NotI/(dT)18 primer and the TimeSaver cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). EcoRI single strand oligonucleotide adapters were then ligated to the cDNAs, and the library was inserted into the EcoRI and NotI sites of the Gal4 transcription activation domain vector pGAD3S2X, a modified version of the pGAD GH (CLONTECH) containing a NotI site in its polylinker. This resulted in a Gal4 activation domain (AD)-cDNA hybrid. Two-hybrid screens were performed as described in detail in previous studies (33Bouhamdan M. Benichou S. Rey F. Navarro J.-M. Agostini I.

HEED deletion mutants HEEDNt120–535, HEEDNt65–494, and HEEDNt96–494 were three natural clones isolated from human cells by our two-hybrid screen (refer to Fig. 2 b). The murineeed clone was kindly provided by O. Denisenko, and a chimeric full-length m/HEED protein was genetically reconstituted by fusion of the N-terminal 64-residue coding sequence from mouse EED to coding sequence 65–535 from human EED. Other deletions and substitutions were constructed in the HEEDNt120–535 backbone (Fig.2 c) as follows: internal deletion mutant HEEDΔ264–416, double-truncated mutant HEEDNt120–415, and substitution mutants HEED394 and HEED399. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on DNA coding for HEEDNt120–535, subcloned into the pBluescript II KS(−) phagemid (Stratagene), using the polymerase chain reaction technique and two complementary mutagenic oligonucleotides (see Ref. 35Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2104) Google Scholar), whose sequence and position in the different genes will be communicated upon request. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. A human spleen cDNA library (5′-Stretch Plus cDNA library; CLONTECH) was probed withheedNt120–535 DNA isolated from the pGAD-cDNA hybrid plasmid by EcoRI-NotI digestion and labeling by random priming (Random Primers DNA Labeling System, Life Technologies, Inc.), using [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The tissue distribution of theheed transcripts was analyzed by hybridization of blotted mRNAS from various human organs and tissues (Human MultiTissue Northern blot IV, CLONTECH) with [32P]dCTP-labeled heedNt120–535 DNA probe. The HEEDNt120–535 and gag-derived DNAs were inserted in pBluescript RN3 plasmid (36Lemaire P. Garrett N. Gurdon J.B. Cell. 1995; 81: 85-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and HEED and GAG proteins obtained by combined in vitro transcription-translation reaction, using a commercial kit (TNT kit, Promega) and the manufacturer's protocol. Protein labeling was performed usingl-[35S]methionine (in vivo cell labeling grade, specific activity ≥37 TBq/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HEEDNt120–535 protein and different GAG proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins, using the pGEX-KG plasmid (37Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins were purified by affinity on glutathione-Sepharose gel and recovered by thrombin cleavage of the GST linker, using a commercial kit (Bulk GST Purification Module, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For in vitro interactions, 20-μl aliquots of glutathione-Sepharose bead suspension were mixed with 400-μl aliquots of sonicated bacterial cell lysate (corresponding to 100 ml of E. coli culture) in binding buffer (BB: phosphate-buffered saline, containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Protease Inhibitor Mixture, Boehringer Mannheim), at 1 tablet per 10 ml of buffer) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. After extensive rinsing in BB, 20-μl aliquots of the affinity beads were mixed with 50–100 μl (100 μg) of affinity purified HEED or GAG proteins and 900 μl of BB and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The beads were then washed three times with 500 μl of BB, resuspended, and boiled in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting. Alternatively, 5-μl aliquots of [35S]methionine-labeled cell-free translated proteins (HEED or GAG proteins) were mixed with 200 μl of BB and 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads pre-adsorbed with GST-fused HEED or GAG proteins. After 2 h incubation at room temperature, the samples were processed for SDS-PAGE analysis as above, and gels were dried and autoradiographed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of SDS-denatured protein samples and immunoblotting techniques have been described in detail in previous studies (21Carrière C. Gay B. Chazal N. Morin N. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2366-2377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chazal N. Gay B. Carrière C. Tournier J. Boulanger P. J.

GAG proteins containing the MA domain were detected on blots using monoclonal antibody anti-MAp17 (Epiclone 5003, mapped to the motif DTGHSSQVSQNY, within residues 121–132 in the MA; see Ref. 23Chazal N. Gay B. Carrière C. Tournier J. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In certain cases, polyclonal anti-GAG antibody (laboratory-made; see Ref. 25Huvent I. Hong S.S. Fournier C. Gay B. Tournier J. Carrière C. Courcoul M. Vigne R. Spire B. Boulanger P. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was used. Antiserum against HEED was prepared in rabbit, by injection of purified HEEDNt120–535 protein obtained by affinity purification of GST-fused protein as described above. Anti-HEED serum was used at a working dilution of 1:2,000 in immunoblotting reactions. A filamentous phage-displayed hexapeptide library (kindly provided by G. Smith; see Ref. 38Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) was used for biopanning onto immobilized protein ligate. Specific ligand elution of phages has been described in previous studies (25Huvent I. Hong S.S. Fournier C. Gay B. Tournier J. Carrière C. Courcoul M. Vigne R. Spire B. Boulanger P. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 39Hong S.S. Boulanger P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4714-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 40Hong S.S. Karayan L. Tournier J. Curiel D.T. Boulanger P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2294-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Purified MA143 was immobilized on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates used as the solid support. Elution of phages was carried out using HEEDNt120–535 protein as soluble competing ligand. In the reverse biopanning experiment, purified HEEDNt120–535 was coated onto the plate, and MA143 was used as the soluble competing ligand. The hexapeptide phagotopes were identified by manual DNA sequencing of the recombinant fUSE5 pIII protein, using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (41Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52766) Google Scholar), oligonucleotide 5′-TGAATTTTCTGTATGAGG-3′ as the primer, and Sequenase kit version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Multiple sequence alignment was performed using the W(1.4) version of the Clustal program (42Higgins D.G. Sharp P.M. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (2885) Google Scholar). HEEDNt120–535 gene was cloned under the polyhedrin promoter ofAutographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus and expressed in recombinant A. californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus-infected Sf9 cells. The intermediate baculoviral vectors and cloning strategies have been reported in previous studies (21Carrière C. Gay B. Chazal N. Morin N. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2366-2377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chazal N. Carrière C. Gay B. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 111-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chazal N. Gay B. Carrière C.

In double infection experiments, Sf9 cells were infected with equal multiplicity of infection of two recombinant baculoviruses (5 plaque-forming units/cell), one expressing the HEED protein, the other expressing the MA143. Co-localization of HEED and MA proteins was analyzed using immunoelectron microscopy with double labeling. The cDNA of full-length m/HEED chimera was cloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector (CLONTECH), and HEED protein was expressed in fusion to the C terminus of the green fluorescent protein variant EGFP (GFPmut1; see Ref. 43Yang T.T. Kain S.R. Kitts P. Kondepudi A. Yang M.M. Youvan D.C. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 173: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HeLa or 293 cells were transfected with the pEGFP-C1-heed vector, using a conventional calcium phosphate method, with or without cotransfection with a MA143-expressing vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen). Cellular localization of HEED and MA proteins was analyzed by confocal laser system microscopy, using a Bio-Rad 1024 apparatus. The Bio-Rad 1024 was interfaced with an argon/krypton ion laser, equipped with fluorescence filters and detectors allowing detection of fluorescein isothiocyanate (or EGFP) and rhodamine markers. Images were acquired sequentially for each fluorescence, to avoid fluorescence cross-talk between the two channels. 0.35-μm spaced sections were taken in the horizontal plane and reintegrated into a single image. Co-localization of fluorescent proteins was visualized by superimposition of EGFP and rhodamine images. Cell specimens were included, sectioned, and processed for conventional EM or IEM, according to previously described methods (21Carrière C. Gay B. Chazal N. Morin N. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2366-2377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25Huvent I. Hong S.S. Fournier C. Gay B. Tournier J. Carrière C. Courcoul M. Vigne R. Spire B. Boulanger P. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1069-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal anti-MA antibody and rabbit anti-HEED antibody were used for IEM, with the corresponding colloidal gold-labeled complementary antibodies, 5-nm gold-tagged anti-mouse Ig antibody, and 10-nm gold-tagged anti-rabbit Ig antibody, respectively. The specimens were observed under the Hitachi HU7100 electron microscope. The nucleotide sequence of the human eed clone analyzed in this study has been registered in GenBankTM and EMBL Data Bank under the accession numbers U90651 and AF099032. The different gag-derived gene products used in the present study, and called under the general term of GAG proteins, were abbreviated according to their major structural domains and amino acid sequence characteristics (Fig.1 a). Thus, the wild type recombinant MA protein, from the N-myristoylated N-terminal glycine until tyrosine at position 132, was designated by MA132, and the wild type capsid p24 protein (spanning residues 133–363 in Pr55GAG), was abbreviated CA. The C-truncated GAG precursor mutants carrying an amber or ocher stop codon that terminates the GAG reading frame at position 120 within the MA domain (GAGamb120), at position 143 within the CA domain (GAGamb143) or at position 180 within the CA domain (GAGoch180), have been described in previous studies (23Chazal N. Gay B. Carrière C. Tournier J. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These gag gene products were designated by MA120, MA143, and MA180, respectively. MA120 is a matrix protein deleted of 12 residues from its C-terminal end; MA143 consisted of a matrix protein with a C-terminal addition of 11 residues belonging to the CA domain, and MA180 is a matrix with a C-terminal addition of 49 residues from the CA. MA13-CA was a construct corresponding to the entire CA domain (p24CA) whose N terminus was fused to the last 13 residues from the MA domain. The construction of the MA deletion mutants D1 to D9 (17Yu X. Yuan X. Matsuda Z. Lee T.H. Essex M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4966-4971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in recombinant full-length precursor Pr55GAG has already been published (23Chazal N. Gay B. Carrière C. Tournier J. Boulanger P. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 365-375Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the purpose of the present study, each MA deletion was reintroduced into the MA132 backbone. Substitution mutant MA132F carried a phenylalanine residue and MA132EE a dipeptide glutamate-glutamate in lieu of the C-terminal tyrosine. The different GAG protein constructs are depicted in Fig. 1 (a andb). The different HEED proteins and HEED mutants are sketched in Fig.2. The amino acid sequence (amino acids 1–535) of the murine eed gene product (32Denisenko O. Bomsztyk C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4707-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) was taken as the reference for numbering the residues in the human EED homolog. The product of the unspliced heed mRNA contained a stop codon at position 495, whereas the HEED protein translated from the spliced transcript ended its open reading frame at arginine 535, as in mouse (Fig. 2 a). Our original HEED clone isolated by two-hybrid screen, HEEDNt120–535, was an N-terminal truncated (Nt) form, starting its open reading frame at position Asp-120 and ending at residue Arg-535 (Fig. 2 b). The largest HEED protein isolated from human cells was called HEEDNt65–535, as it lacked the N-terminal 64 residues of the corresponding mouse sequence. Its shorter equivalent, translated from the unspliced heed mRNA, was termed HEEDNt65–494. Full-length m/HEED protein was a chimericeed gene product consisting of the N-terminal 64 residues from mouse EED, fused to sequence 65–535 of human EED protein. N-terminal deletion mutant HEEDNt96–494 started its sequence at serine 96. Other HEED constructs used were internal deletion (Δ) mutant HEEDΔ264–416, double-truncated mutant HEEDNt120–415, and substitution mutants HEED394 and HEED399 (Fig. 2 c). The HIVILAI MA143 was fused to the DNA-binding LexA protein and used as a molecular bait for screening a cDNA library from phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated human lymphocytes, cloned in fusion with the Gal4-activating domain. Out of 3 × 106double transformants obtained, 58 positive clones were selected and arranged into nine groups of cDNAs. The most represented group (29.4% of the isolated clones) consisted of a unique cDNA sequence of 1,600 base pairs in length. Comparison with DNA sequences in data banks revealed that it presented 91% identity, at the nucleotide level, with the murine (Mus musculus) gene eed (embryonic ectoderm development; see Refs. 30Shumacher A.

The heed gene product, the HEED protein, was found to interact with the three forms of MA proteins assayed by the two-hybrid system in yeast, the C-terminally extended MA143, wild type MA132, and C-terminally deleted MA120 (Fig.3, lanes 1, 2 and6), implying that the interacting domain was localized in the N-terminal 120 residues of the MA domain. The amino acid sequence of the HEED protein is shown in Fig.4 a. Our originalheed gene product isolated (referred to as HEEDNt120–535) showed an open reading frame of 416 residues, starting at aspartic acid 120 and ending at the same C-terminal arginine residue 535 as the murine EED protein (Figs. 2 b and 4 a).Figure 4a, amino acid sequence of the human EED protein (HEED), deduced from DNA sequencing.

https://openalex.org/W2040681857,"Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) is a type II membrane protein that catalyzes the proteolytic activation of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1 (ET-1). The subcellular distribution of ECE-1, and hence the exact site of physiological activation of big ET-1, remains controversial. Here, we demonstrate with several complementary methods that the two alternatively spliced bovine ECE-1 isoforms, ECE-1a and ECE-1b, differing only in the first 30 amino acids of their N-terminal cytoplasmic tails, exhibit strikingly distinct intracellular sorting patterns. Bovine ECE-1a, which is responsible for the intracellular cleavage of big ET-1 in endothelial cells, is constitutively recruited into the lysosome, where it is rapidly degraded. In contrast, bovine ECE-1b, the isoform found in cultured smooth muscle cells, is transported to the plasma membrane by a default pathway and functions as an ectoenzyme. Mutational analyses reveal that the N-terminal tip of the cytoplasmic domain of bovine ECE-1a contains novel proline-containing signals that mediate constitutive lysosomal targeting. Analyses of chimeric ECE-1/transferrin receptors demonstrate that the cytoplasmic tail of bovine ECE-1a is sufficient for the lysosomal delivery and rapid degradation. Our results suggest that the distinct intracellular targeting of bovine ECE-1 isoforms may provide new insights into functional aspect of the endothelin system and that the cell permeability of ECE inhibitor compounds should be carefully considered during their pharmacological development.

They act on two molecularly distinct subtypes of seven membrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptors, the endothelin A (ETA) and endothelin B (ETB) receptors, to mediate a wide variety of biological activities (3Arai H.

The approximately 200-residue preproendothelins are first processed by a furin-like processing protease(s) into biologically inactive intermediates termed big endothelins (big ETs). These are then proteolytically cleaved between Trp21 and Val/Ile22 to produce active endothelins. This proteolytic conversion is catalyzed by specific endothelin-converting enzymes (ECEs). Two isozymes of ECE, ECE-1 and ECE-2, have been molecularly identified (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 15Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. J. Biol.

Both ECEs are type II membrane proteins with highly conserved Zn2+metalloprotease motifs and cleave big ET-1 to produce ET-1 in vitro as well as in transfected cells. The two enzymes work at different pH ranges; ECE-1 cleaves big endothelins at a neutral pH, while ECE-2 functions in an acidic pH range. This implies that these enzymes function in different subcellular locations: ECE-1 may act in early components of the secretory pathway, presumably in the Golgi apparatus, as well as on the cell surface. In contrast, ECE-2 probably functions in highly acidified compartments of the secretory pathway, including a portion of the trans-Golgi apparatus. Immunohistochemical analyses of ECE-1 suggest that it is responsible for the production of mature ET-1 in a variety of cells, including several kinds of endothelial cells (17Takahashi M. Fukuda K. Shimada K. Barnes K. Turner A.J. Ikeda M. Koike H. Yamamoto Y. Tanzawa K. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 18Barnes K. Shimada K. Takahashi M. Tanzawa K. Turner A.J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 919-928PubMed Google Scholar). These isozymes also appear to have different functions during embryonic development. Targeted disruption of the ECE-1 gene in mice revealed that ECE-1 is the major enzyme involved in the activation of big ET-1 and big ET-3 at specific developmental stages (19Yanagisawa H. Yanagisawa M. Kapur R.P. Richardson J.A. Williams S.C. Clouthier D.E. de Wit D. Emoto N. Hammer R.E. Development. 1998; 125: 825-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, it appears that loss of ECE-1 protein cannot be compensated for by ECE-2. However, the subcellular localization of ECE-1, as well as the exact site of actual activation of big ET-1, remains controversial. ECE-1 has been reported to be present in the Golgi apparatus (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M.

Walkden B.J. Wilkinson T.C. Turner A.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). More recent studies using electron microscopy and a cell surface biotinylation method demonstrated that ECE-1 in endothelial cells is present both on the cell surface and in intracellular vesicles (23Barnes K. Brown C. Turner A.J. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In whole animal preparations and isolated perfused tissues, exogenously administered big endothelins induce vasopressor actions; these activities are inhibited by the metalloprotease inhibitor, phosphoramidon (26Matsumura Y. Hisaki K. Takaoka M. Morimoto S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1990; 185: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). This suggests that cleavage of exogenously supplied big ET-1 takes place on the cell surface. In contrast, in vascular endothelial cells and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the ECE-1 cDNA, cleavage of endogenously synthesized big ET-1 occurred intracellularly during transit through the Golgi apparatus (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 27Ikegawa R. Matsumura Y. Tsukahara Y. Takaoka M. Morimoto S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 669-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, there appear to be different conversion sites of big ET-1. However, it is unclear whether the same ECE molecule is responsible for these different conversions. Clarifying the exact site at which ECE-1 functions is of importance to understand its physiological roles and to design ECE inhibitors for therapeutic purpose. Recently, two subisoforms of ECE-1, termed ECE-1a and ECE-1b, which differ from each other only in the N-terminal tip of their cytoplasmic tail, were identified (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar, 24Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K.

Structural studies of the human ECE-1 gene indicate that these two isoforms are generated by alternative splicing (29Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29794-29798Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). To investigate the significance of these two isoforms of ECE-1, we have studied the possibility that the N-terminal cytoplasmic tails of bovine ECE-1a and ECE-1b determine subcellular localization of the protein and hence the site at which big ET-1 is converted to the mature peptide. We provide morphological, biochemical, and pharmacological evidence showing that these subisoforms exhibit distinct intracellular sorting patterns, both in native vascular cells and in transfected CHO cells. Furthermore, we have uncovered signals in the alternatively spliced cytoplasmic tail of bovine ECE-1a that are responsible for constitutive lysosomal targeting of this integral membrane protein. Synthetic human big ET-1-(1–38) and ET-1 were obtained from American Peptides. Phosphoramidon and chloroquine were obtained from Sigma. FR901533 (WS79089B) and FR139317 (WS79089B) were gifts from Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. Fura-2-AM was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). The supernatant of cultured cells was directly applied to a sandwich-type enzyme immunoassay (EIA) that showed no cross-reactivity between big ET-1 and ET-1 (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). CHO cells were cultured as described (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). The coding region of bovine ECE-1a or ECE-1b was subcloned into the pME18Sf expression vector (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of CHO cells and isolation of the transfectant clones (CHO/ECE-1a and CHO/ECE-1b) were performed as described (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Clones that showed a similar level of expression by Northern blotting were chosen for further analysis. Endothelial cells were isolated from bovine coronary arteries by collagenase treatment as described (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Arterial smooth muscle cells were isolated from bovine coronary artery by explantation. Bronchial smooth muscle cells were isolated from bovine trachea by collagenase treatment or explantation and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Smooth muscle cells were identified by staining of the smooth muscle cell-specific α-actin and also by their characteristic spindle shape. For co-culture experiments, approximately 1 × 105 cells of CHO/prepro-ET-1, a CHO stable cell line that expresses big ET-1 (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), and 1 × 105 cells of either CHO/ECE-1a or CHO/ECE-1b were plated onto a 12-well plate and grown overnight. After washing twice with medium, cells were fed fresh complete medium in the presence or absence of FR901533 at the designated concentrations and incubated for 12 h. The supernatant was directly used for enzyme immunoassay to measure big ET-1 and ET-1. RNA was extracted from cells using RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST “B”, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. First-strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with 1 μg of total RNA and oligo(dT)12–18 primers by using SuperScript reverse transcriptase II (Life Technologies, Inc.) as recommended by the manufacturer. The PCR contained 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, a 0.2 mm concentration of each dNTP, a 100 nm concentration of each amplification primer, 10 ng of first strand cDNA, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. The primers, 5′-ATGTCTCCCCGGGGGCAGGAT-3′ (corresponding to amino acids 1–8 of bovine ECE-1a) and 5′-TTCACCTGCAGGGAAGGAGGCA-3′ (amino acids 29–36 of ECE-1a) were used for bovine ECE-1a-specific amplification (108-base pair PCR product expected), and the primers, 5′-ATGTCTACCTACAAGCGGCCCA-3′ (amino acids 1–8 of bovine ECE-1b) and 5′-TTCACCTGCAGGTGGTTGGGGT-3′ (amino acids 24–31 of ECE-1b) were used for bovine ECE-1b-specific amplification (93 base pairs expected). Thirty cycles of PCR were performed at an annealing temperature of 60 °C, and the PCRs were separated on a 2% agarose gel. The PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. Quantitative PCR was performed using real time PCR detection technology and analyzed on a model 7700 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems) (30Luoh S.M. Di Marco F. Levin N. Armanini M. Xie M.H.

The assay uses the 5′-nuclease activity of Taq polymerase to cleave a nonextendible hybridization probe during the extension phase of PCR. The fluorescent reporter located on the 5′-end of the probe is released from a quenching dye present on the 3′-end, and fluorescent emission is measured in real time. Threshold values are calculated by determining the point at which the fluorescence exceeds a threshold limit (usually 10 times the S.D. values of the base line). The primers 5′-ATGTCTACCTACAAGCGGGCCA-3′ and 5′-TTGGTGGACGTCCACTTGAAGG-3′ were used for bovine ECE-1b-specific amplification, and the primers 5′-AAGAAGGCGTTTGAAGAGAGC-3′ and 5′-TGGCCGATTTCCGAGTATC-3′ were used to amplify the common region of bovine ECE-1. The hybridization probes were 5′-TACACGTCGCTCTCGGACAGCGAGT-3′ (ECE-1b specific) and 5′-TCATCCATCCACTTCAGGGTGCTCA-3′ (common region). These oligonucleotide probes, which bind to the amplified PCR products, were labeled with a reporter dye, FAM (6-carboxyfluorescein), on the 5′ nucleotide and a quenching dye, TAMRA (6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine), on the 3′ nucleotide. The PCRs were carried out using TaqMan PCR reagent (Applied Biosystems) as recommended by the manufacturer. Each PCR amplification was performed in quadruplicate, using the following conditions: 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C, followed by a total of 40 two-temperature cycles (15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C). For the generation of standard curves, serial dilutions of a cDNA sample made from CHO/ECE-1b cells were used. A normalization to ECE-1b expressed in smooth muscle cell was performed for each sample. The amount of ECE-1a was calculated by subtracting the amount of ECE-1b from the total amount of ECE-1. Cells were seeded onto coverslips and cultured for 2 days. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized in methanol for 5 min at −20 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), PBS containing 10% (v/v) normal goat serum (NGS/PBS) was added. Following a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the NGS/PBS was replaced with buffer containing polyclonal antibody (1:100) directed against bovine ECE-1 C-terminal peptides (16Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). After incubation for 90 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed six times with PBS for 10 min each and then incubated in NGS/PBS containing 7.5 μg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). After 45 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed nine times with PBS for 10 min each. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides with 90% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), and 2.5% (w/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The rhodamine-lentil lectin (Vector Laboratories), used to counterstain the Golgi apparatus, was incubated at 2.5 μg/ml. Monoclonal antibody UH3, which recognizes hamster lysosomal membrane glycoprotein B, was obtained from The Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). For cell surface staining, cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Following two washes in PBS, cells were incubated in PBS containing 10% (w/v) nonfat dry milk (milk/PBS) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were incubated in milk/PBS containing a polyclonal antibody (1:100) directed against ECE-1 C-terminal peptides for 90 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed six times with PBS for 10 min each and then incubated in milk/PBS containing 7.5 μg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. After 45 min at 37 °C, the cells were washed nine times with PBS for 10 min each. The coverslips were mounted on microscope slides as described above. Three negative control conditions were examined: staining with preimmune serum, antibody after preabsorption, and omission of primary antibody. None of these conditions resulted in cell staining. The stable transfected CHO cell lines, CHO/ECE-1a and ECE-1b, were transiently transfected with the ETA endothelin receptor expression construct and loaded with Fura 2-AM. Synthetic human ET-1 or big ET-1 was applied to these cells, and intracellular calcium changes were monitored by a Jasco CAM-110 intracellular ion analyzer as described (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In some experiments, cells were pretreated with FR139317, an ETAreceptor antagonist, or phosphoramidon. Cells were plated onto a 60-mm dish to obtain 70–80% confluency and grown overnight. Cells were washed twice with starvation medium (methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum), preincubated in starvation medium for 1 h, and incubated for 1 h in 1.5 ml of the same medium containing 100 μCi/ml Trans35S-label (ICN Biomedical). Pulse-labeled cells were chased for the designated times in complete medium. In some experiments, cells were preincubated for 2–6 h in the medium containing 100 μm phosphoramidon, 30 mm ammonium chloride, or 100 μm chloroquine and chased for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h in the same medium. At each time point, labeled cells were placed on ice and solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1% Zwittergent). ECE-1a and ECE-1b were immunoprecipitated from postnuclear supernatants using the polyclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of bovine ECE-1. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 7.0% polyacrylamide gels. Quantitation of radioactivity was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Postnuclear lysate was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and filters were probed with an antibody against the C terminus of bovine ECE-1 (16Emoto N. Yanagisawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15262-15268Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) and developed using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as recommended by the manufacturer. Deletion constructs and alanine-substituted constructs were made by site-directed mutagenesis (32Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa M. Sawamura T. Enoki T. Ohtani T. Sakurai T. Nakao K. Toyo-oka T. Masaki T. J.

Stable transfection of CHO cells and isolation of the transfectant clones were performed as described (14Xu D. Emoto N. Giaid A. Slaughter C. Kaw S. de Wit D. Yanagisawa M. Cell. 1994; 78: 473-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). At least 12 independent stable transfectant clones from each mutant were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoblotting as well as in some cases, by pulse-chase immunoprecipitation. The cytoplasmic domain of bovine ECE-1a (amino acids 1–56) or ECE-1b (amino acids 1–51) was fused in frame to the transmembrane helix (residues 62–89) and the entire extracellular domain (residues 90–761) of the human transferrin receptor (TfR) as follows. Initially, a 683-base pair PCR product, containing the transmembrane helix and part of extracellular domain of the human transferrin receptor, was generated using the human transferrin receptor cDNA as a template. The sense primer, 5′-TGTAGTGGATCCATCTGCTATGGG-3′, corresponds to the first eight amino acids of the transmembrane helix of the human transferrin receptor with the substitution of AGT for TCC (italic type) to create a BamHI site (underlined) as a silent mutation. The antisense primer, 5′-GGGAAATTTAGTCTGGTCCATGTAATA-3′, represents about 30 base pairs downstream of the unique HindIII site (position 912) of the human transferrin receptor. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and HindIII. Next, the cytoplasmic tails of bovine ECE-1a and ECE-1b were generated by PCR. The sense primers (5′-TTGAATTCCTGATGTCTCCCCGGGGGCAGGAT-3′ for ECE-1a, 5′-TTGAATTCGGGATGTCTACCTACAAGCGGGCC-3′ for ECE-1b) represent the first seven amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of bovine ECE-1a or ECE-1b including an EcoRI site (underlined) in the 5′-end. The antisense primer, 5′-ATGGATCCACTACACCGCTTCTCCACCGGGGT-3′, represents the 3′-end of the cytoplasmic tail of bovine ECE-1 (common for ECE-1a and ECE-1b) and four amino acids of the human transferrin receptor including the BamHI site (underlined), which allows the fusion of the cytoplasmic tail of bovine ECE-1a or ECE-1b to occur in the correct reading frame with respect to the human transferrin receptor. The amplified PCR products were digested withEcoRI and BamHI. All of the PCR products were verified by DNA sequencing. After fusing these PCR products, we ligated the resulting fragment into the rest of the C-terminal portion of the human transferrin receptor cDNA. The chimeric cDNAs were inserted into the expression vector, pME18Sf–(designated ECE-1a–TfR or ECE-1b–TfR). The expression constructs were stably transfected into CHO-K1 cells (CHO/ECE-1a–TfR or CHO/ECE-1b–TfR), and three independent clones from each stable transfected cell line were further analyzed. The cell lines, which display similar levels of chimeric protein expression between ECE-1a–TfR and ECE-1b–TfR, were compared in parallel by immunostaining and immunoprecipitation as described above. For pulse-chase experiments, we used a 20-μl mixture of transferrin receptor monoclonal antibodies, which recognize the extracellular portion of the human transferrin receptor (Ab-1 from Calbiochem and CD71 (clone MEM-75) from Accurate Chemical & Scientific Corp.). Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for immunoprecipitation. For immunostaining, CD71 (at a dilution of 1:10) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti mouse IgG (7.5 μg/ml, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used. Recent studies have shown that the ECE-1 gene contains two alternative promoters and first exons, generating ECE-1a and ECE-1b polypeptides that differ from each other in the N-terminal half of their cytoplasmic tails (24Shimada K. Takahashi M. Ikeda M. Tanzawa K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 140-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 29Valdenaire O. Rohrbacher E. Mattei M.G. J. Biol.

Hori S. Aramori I. Ohkubo H. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1990; 348: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar), exclusively express ECE-1b mRNA (Fig.1 A). In contrast, both ECE-1a and ECE-1b mRNAs were detectable in cultured vascular endothelial cells by nonquantitative reverse transcription-PCR (Fig.1 A). Therefore, we determined the relative quantity of the two isoforms in both cell types by real time quantitative PCR using a fluorogenic 5′ nuclease assay (30Luoh S.M. Di Marco F. Levin N. Armanini M.

Retinoic acid, combined with cAMP analogs, sharply induces the Bmp2 mRNA during the differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells into parietal endoderm. Retinoic acid (RA) also induces the Bmp2 gene in chick limb buds. Since normalBmp2 expression may require an endogenous retinoid signal and aberrant Bmp2 expression may cause some aspects of RA-induced teratogenesis, we studied the mechanism underlying the induction of Bmp2. Measurements of the Bmp2mRNA half-life and nuclear run-on assays indicated that RA stimulated the transcription rate of the Bmp2 gene. The results of ribonuclease protection and primer extension assays indicated that Bmp2 transcription started 2,127 nucleotides upstream of the translation start site in F9 cells. To identify genetic elements controlling this transcription rate increase, upstream and downstream genomic sequences flanking the Bmp2 gene were screened using chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter genes in F9 cells and β-galactosidase reporter genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that were cotransformed with retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor expression plasmids. RA-dependent transcriptional activation was detected between base pairs −2,373 and −2,316 relative to the translation start site.

The phenotypes of these mutants prove that BMP signaling is required for numerous extraembryonic and embryonic developmental processes. The evolutionary conservation of the Bmp2 andBmp4 genes and their Drosophila homologdpp is remarkable. Conservation exists at both the functional and sequence levels (8Graff J. Cell. 1997; 89: 171-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 12Sampath T.K. Rashka K.E. Doctor J.S. Tucker R.F. Hoffmann F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both BMP2 in mouse and DPP in Drosophila have pleiotropic functions and are expressed in a highly tissue- and stage-specific manner. Multiple promoters and alternative splicing produce three major and several minordpp transcripts (15St. Johnston R.D. Hoffmann F.M. Blackman R.K. Segal D. Grimaila R. Padgett R.W. Irick H.A. Gelbart W.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1114-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Our work in murine cells and theDrosophila studies indicate that the multiple core promoters are closely involved in Bmp2 and dpptissue-specific regulation. It is likely that the regulation of this essential growth factor in mammals equals the complexity ofdpp regulation in Drosophila. Many Bmp2-expressing tissues develop abnormally in vitamin A-deficient embryos or after exposure to the potent teratogen retinoic acid (RA). These include the heart and cardiovasculature, limbs, central nervous system, craniofacial structures, and vertebrae (see Refs. 3Hogan B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar and 16Zile M. J. Nutr. 1998; 128 (suppl.): 455-458Crossref Google Scholar and references therein). The first indication that the Bmp2 gene was regulated by RA was the discovery that it was strongly induced in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells stimulated to differentiate with RA (17Rogers M.B. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Gudas L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Subsequently, theBmp2 gene was found to be induced by RA in the developing chick limb (18Francis P.H. Richardson M.K. Brickell P.M. Tickle C. Development. 1994; 120: 209-218PubMed Google Scholar). Since retinoid signaling may contribute to the normal pattern of embryonic Bmp2 expression and since the aberrant induction of Bmp2 by excess RA may cause some RA-associated deformities, elucidating the genetic regulatory elements controlling the RA inducibility of Bmp2 will increase our understanding of normal development and teratogenesis. F9 cells, a widely used model of cellular differentiation and early embryonic development, are an excellent biochemical system for investigating RA-inducible genes. F9 embryonal carcinoma cells differentiate rapidly and synchronously into primitive endoderm upon treatment with RA and into parietal endoderm upon treatment with RA and cAMP analogs (19Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). This model system has been used to identify retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) controlling the expression of several important developmental genes, such as Hoxa1 (20Langston A. Gudas L. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), laminin B1 (21Vasios G.W. Gold J.D. Petkovich M. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9099-9103Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), and now Bmp2. Here we describe the first genetic regulatory elements controlling the RA-regulated induction of the Bmp2 gene in embryonic cells. RA-regulated gene expression is mediated by nuclear receptors, which act as retinoid-dependent transcription factors (22Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Encoded by six different genes, RARα, -β, and -γ and RXRα, -β, and -γ, the receptors can act as homodimers and heterodimers, often with unique DNA binding and transactivation specificities (see Refs. 23Zhang X. Lehmann J. Hoffmann B. Dawson M. Cameron J. Graupner G. Hermann T. Tran P. Pfahl M. Nature. 1992; 358: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar and 24Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesano K. Evans R.M. Sporn M. Roberts A. Goodman D. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 319-349Google Scholar). RARs bind to and are activated by all-trans-RA and 9-cis-RA, while the RXRs are activated only by 9-cis-RA. Our experiments in yeast suggest that, like Hoxa1 and RARβ, ligands that bind both RARs and RXRs synergistically activate the Bmp2 promoter. The work also suggests that, as in Drosophila, multiple transcription start sites are utilized in different mammalian tissues. F9 embryonal carcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. The cells were induced to differentiate into primitive endoderm by adding RA alone and into parietal endoderm by adding RA, 250 μm dibutyryl cAMP, and 500 μm theophylline (RACT).

Polymerase chain reaction-positive aliquots were then screened (25$$Google Scholar) with 32P-labeled probe from the full-lengthBmp2 cDNA (pBMP2–452, kindly provided by David Israel) or a Bmp2 subclone (pBMP2–68, nucleotides 6,483–6,724 with respect to the translation start site) to isolate two overlapping bacteriophage that contain the entire Bmp2 gene and extensive 5′- and 3′-flanking sequences (16.5 kilobases total). λmBMP2–4771 contains the 5′-flanking region of Bmp2(nucleotides −8,583 to +3,360 relative to the translation start site). λmBMP2–1 contains the remainder of the transcribed region and the 3′-flanking region (nucleotides 2,979–15,700; see Fig. 2). Plasmids were constructed as follows. All nucleotide positions are indicated with respect to the translation start site. For pCAT5′NN6.8 (−8,583 to −2,320) and pCAT5′NN6.3 (−2,287 to +3,360), NotI fragments extending fromNotI sites in λ DASH II to each of two genomicNotI sites from λmBMP2–4771 were filled with Klenow fragment and ligated into the filled XbaI site in front of the pBLCAT2 Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) minimal promoter (26Luckow B.

For pCAT3′BN3.0 (12,700–15,700), a fragment downstream of the Bmp2 gene was obtained by digesting bacteriophage λmBMP2–1 at the genomicBamHI site and the λ DASH II NotI site. The ends were filled and ligated into the SmaI site of pBLCAT2 downstream of the CAT coding region.

Binding reactions contained 1 unit of rhSP1 (Promega), 60,000 cpm (2 ng) of probe, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (New England BioLabs), 2% Ficoll, and 0.05 mg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA (Sigma). Samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel (74:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 5% glycerol (w/v)). Electrophoresis was performed at 300 V for 45 min in 0.5× TBE at 4 °C. The gel was dried under vacuum onto filter paper (Whatman) and exposed overnight to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). RNA abundance may be regulated by alterations in transcription rate and in message stability. Previous experiments using the transcriptional inhibitors actinomycin D and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole showed thatBmp2 mRNA stability does not change with RA treatment (35Rogers M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggested, but did not prove, that RA increasedBmp2 transcription rates. To test this hypothesis, we isolated nuclei from untreated cells or cells treated with RACT for 72 h and performed nuclear run-on assays (Fig.1 A). Bmp2 gene transcription increased 3.7-fold in RACT-treated cells relative to untreated cells. In contrast, the transcription of 36B4, a constitutively expressed ribosomal protein, did not vary. This directly demonstrated transcriptional induction of the Bmp2 gene by RA. Two Bmp2promoters have been described in osteoblast cells (36Feng J. Harris M. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Feng M. Mundy G. Harris S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Feng J.Q. Chen D. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Esparza J. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We used ribonuclease protection assays to determine if these transcription start sites or others were RA-inducible in F9 cells (Fig.1 B). An antisense RNA probe that extended from nucleotide −1,541 to −1,233 relative to the translation initiation site was generated from pBMP2-H digested with BglII. The entireBmp2 probe was protected by RNA isolated from RACT-treated cells (Fig. 1 B, thick arrow), indicating that Bmp2 transcription initiated upstream of nucleotide −1,541 in F9 cells. No protected fragments were observed in the reactions containing RNA from untreated cells, yeast tRNA (Fig.1 B), or a sense probe extending from −2,230 to −1,233 (data not shown). The open arrow indicates the predicted location of a fragment generated by a transcript originating at the proximal promoter (nucleotide −1,344) described by Fenget al. (36Feng J. Harris M. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Feng M. Mundy G. Harris S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The absence of a fragment at this location indicates that, in contrast to osteoblast cells, this promoter is not used in F9 cells. Using an antisense probe that extended from −2,287 to −1,663 generated from pBMP2-NX, we observed a fragment of approximately 493 nucleotides. This suggests that transcription starts at approximately −2,156, near the distal promoter used in osteoblasts. To confirm the transcription start site, primer extension was performed utilizing reverse transcriptase and a primer complementary to base pairs −2,064 to −2,045 relative to the translation start site (Fig.1 C). An extended product was detected only in the reaction containing RNA from cells treated with 1 μm RA and CT for 96 h and not in the reactions containing RNA from untreated cells or yeast tRNA. Comparison with the genomic sequence designated a start site at nucleotide −2,127. No other RACT-dependent extended products were observed, suggesting utilization of one major transcriptional start site in F9 cells. The differences in mobility between RNA and DNA molecular weight markers explain the small discrepancy in start site position as determined by primer extension or RNase protection assays. CAT assays were used to detect RA- or RACT-dependent increases in CAT reporter activity driven by Bmp2 genomic DNA in F9 cells. The reporter constructs containing sequence flanking theBmp2 gene are shown in Fig. 2. Since two transcriptional start sites have been described (37Feng J.Q. Chen D. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Esparza J. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), all nucleotide positions are indicated relative to the translational start site (Fig. 2). Several large regions of the Bmp2 upstream flanking region were inserted upstream of the Herpes simplex virus TK minimal promoter in pBLCAT2. These fragments, extending from −8,583 to −2,320 (pCAT5′NN6.8), −3,367 to +1,206 (pCATXX4.5), and −2,287 to +3,360 (pCAT5′NN6.3), failed to drive CAT expression in F9 cells treated for 96 h with 1 μm RA or 1 μmRA and CT (Fig. 3 A). A fragment that included the 3′-end of the transcribed region (9,316–12,700; pCAT3′BB3.4) did not affect CAT activity. In contrast, a fragment distal to the 3′-end (12,700–15,700; pCAT3′BN3.0) caused a 3.5–4-fold CAT activation relative to the pBLCAT2 vector alone (Fig.3 A). Since activation occurred in cells treated with CT, RA, or RACT, this sequence must contain a non-RA-dependent regulatory element. Considering the highly tissue- and stage-specific expression of Bmp2, many regulatory elements are likely to control Bmp2 expression. Since developmental regulation of the dpp gene is mediated by the core promoter (38Schwyter D.H. Huang J.D. Dubnicoff T. Courey A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3960-3968Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the RA responsiveness of the Bmp2 gene was similarly controlled. If so, then the TK minimal promoter in pBLCAT2 might have interfered with RA-induced transcription. Therefore, Bmp2 sequences were inserted into pBLCAT3, which lacks a minimal promoter. A 1,709-bp fragment, containing nucleotides −3,367 to −1,658 (pCAT4.5X), induced CAT activity 2.8-fold in cells treated for 96 h with 1 μm RA or 1 μm RA and CT relative to the activity observed in CT-treated cells (Fig. 3 B). This fragment included 1,240 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site at −2,127. Finally, a fragment containing only 161 nucleotides upstream of the transcriptional start site (−2,288 to −1,537; pCAT5′NB6.3B) failed to induce CAT activity (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the presence of elements required for the RA response and promoter activity between nucleotides −3,367 and −2,288. As will be discussed below, we used a yeast reporter system to further delineate this RARE. It is difficult to distinguish genes regulated directly by retinoid-activated receptors from those indirectly activated by other transcription factors induced by RA in mammalian cells. To avoid the complications associated with endogenous receptors and other transcription factors in F9 cells, we co-transformed yeast with mammalian receptor expression vectors and reporter genes driven by Bmp2 genomic sequences. Although yeast do not normally express retinoid receptors, yeast transformed with receptor genes synthesize functional receptors. These can stimulate the RA-dependent expression of reporter genes controlled by mammalian RAREs (33Hall B. Smit-McBride Z. Privalsky M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6929-6933Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Allegretto E.A. McClurg M.R. Lazarchik S.B. Clemm D.L. Kerner S.A. Elgort M.G. Boehm M.F. White S.K. Pike J.W. Heyman R.A. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 4281-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We inserted a fragment containing base pairs −3,367 to −1,658 of the Bmp2 gene in front of the cyc1 promoter and the β-galactosidase coding region of the yeast vector, pΔSS (27Schena M. Yamamoto K. Science. 1988; 241: 965-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The yeast strain BJ5409 was transformed with this plasmid and various combinations of RARβ, RARγ or RXRγ yeast expression vectors. Treatment of yeast expressing RARβ or RARγ and RXRγ with 1 μmall-trans-RA or 9-cis-RA induced β-galactosidase activity 1.7- and 2.3-fold, respectively, relative to untreated yeast (Fig. 4 A). Yeast transfected with RARβ or RARγ alone and treated with 9-cis-RA also induced β-galactosidase activity 1.6-fold, indicating that the RAR homodimers could activate Bmp2nearly as efficiently as the RAR/RXR heterodimer (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, yeast expressing RXR alone or yeast lacking receptors failed to express β-galactosidase in response to RA treatment (Fig.4 B). These experiments indicate that the RA responsiveness of this Bmp2 sequence in yeast requires activation of RAR homodimers or RAR/RXR heterodimers. In addition to the naturally occurring all-trans-RA, which activates only RARs, and 9-cis-RA, which activates both RARs and RXRs, several synthetic receptor-selective retinoids are available. TTNPB is often used to demonstrate RAR selectivity in mammalian cells because, unlike all-trans-RA, it cannot be converted to 9-cis-RA. LG100268 is an RXR-selective retinoid (41Boehm M.F. Zhang L. Zhi L. McClurg M.R. Berger E. Wagoner M. Mais D.E. Suto C.M. Davies P.J.A. Heyman R.A. Nadzan A.M. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 3146-3155Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). We treated RARβ- and RXRγ-expressing yeast with 1 μmTTNPB, LG100268, or 9-cis-RA or the combination of TTNPB and LG100268. Like all-trans-RA, TTNPB activated transcription slightly (1.5-fold) but less effectively than 9-cis-RA (2.1-fold, Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, the RXR agonist induced activity as effectively as the panagonist 9-cis-RA, which can activate both the RARs and the RXRs. Combined exposure to these retinoids stimulated activity by 3.6-fold (Fig. 4 C). The synergistic activation of several RA-responsive genes by simultaneous ligand binding of each receptor subunit within a heterodimer has also been observed in mammalian cells (42Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J. Zusi C. Ostrowski J. Reczek P. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). These results are the first to demonstrate that the developmentally crucialBmp2 gene is activated directly by retinoid-bound receptors. Having proven that this sequence could drive the yeast β-galactosidase reporter gene in a ligand- and receptor-dependent manner, we localized this element more precisely using a series of deletion constructs (Fig.5). Deletions of 3′-flanking sequences up to position −2,316 and 5′-flanking sequences up to −2,373 do not alter the induction by 9-cis-RA (bars 1–4). The reporter constructs containing only base pairs −3,195 to −2,369 or −3,367 to −3,191 were not induced by 9-cis-RA (bars 5–6). These results indicate that a 57-bp Bmp2 promoter sequence located between −2,373 and −2,316 bp contains a RARE that is necessary and sufficient to induce RA-mediated transcription. We sequenced base pairs −3,367 to −1,658 of theBmp2 gene to identify consensus sequences for other known regulatory proteins. Sequences consistent with a TATA-containing promoter sequence and a transcription start site at nucleotide −2,127 are depicted in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig.1 C, the primer extension assay confirmed the activity of this promoter in RACT-treated F9 cells. These features are consistent with a promoter at this site. The sequence was also scanned for putative regulatory protein binding sites. A putative Sp1 site was identified between −2,308 and −2,298 (Fig. 6). Since others have demonstrated the importance of Sp1 sites for RA responsiveness (44Darrow A.L. Rickles R.J. Pecorino L.T. Strickland S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5883-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Lehmann J. Zhang X. Pfahl M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2976-2985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Panariello L. Quadro L. Trematerra S. Colantuoni V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25524-25532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we deleted a 32-bp fragment containing the site (Fig. 2). This deletion failed to alter the magnitude of RA inducibility in either yeast (data not shown) or F9 cells (Fig.7 A). However, in F9 cells, both the basal and the induced transcription activity of the CAT reporter gene declined by 30% (Fig. 7 A). We also demonstrated that recombinant Sp1 protein bound this sequence (Fig.7 B). These observations suggest that Sp1 influences the transcription activity of the Bmp2 gene but does not play a role in RA responsiveness. Approximately 200 genes have been shown to be RA-responsive in one cell or another. Some genes are regulated directly by RA-bound receptors, e.g. Hoxa1 (20Langston A. Gudas L. Mech. Dev. 1992; 38: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), while others are secondarily regulated by other transcription factors modulated in RA-treated cells, e.g. Fgf4 (47Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Since both retinoid deficiencies and overdoses can cause embryonic malformations via the aberrant expression of key proteins controlling differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and morphogenesis, it is important to understand which genes are directly regulated. We now present evidence that the gene encoding the essential growth and differentiation factor, BMP2, is a direct target of RA. Bmp2 is transcriptionally induced by RA in F9 embryonal carcinoma cells (Fig. 1 A). Several pieces of evidence suggest that F9 cells utilize a Bmp2 promoter initiating transcription at nucleotide −2,127 relative to the translation initiation site. First, ribonuclease protection assays indicate that the longest Bmp2 transcript initiates near this site (Fig.1 B). Second, this is the end of an RA-inducible primer extension product (Fig. 1 C). Third, the predicted size of a transcript starting at −2,127 is consistent with the mRNA size of 3.8 kilobases (17Rogers M.B. Rosen V. Wozney J.M. Gudas L.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Feng J. Harris M. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Feng M. Mundy G. Harris S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, sequences resembling a TATA-containing promoter are near nucleotide −2,127 (31Prestridge D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In mouse osteoblasts, distal and proximal transcription start sites were observed at nucleotides −2,127 and −1,344 (36Feng J. Harris M. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Feng M. Mundy G. Harris S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1218: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Feng J.Q. Chen D. Ghosh-Choudhury N. Esparza J. Mundy G.R. Harris S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We did not observe a ribonuclease protection fragment corresponding to the proximal start site in untreated or in RACT-treated F9 cells (Fig.2 B). Thus, the proximal promoter does not mediate the RA-induced transcription of Bmp2 in F9 cells. The existence of multiple Bmp2 transcription start sites in different cell types is not surprising, because the expression of the Bmp2gene is highly dynamic. In addition, dpp, the gene encoding the Drosophila homolog of Bmp2, has three major and several minor transcripts produced from several promoters (15St. Johnston R.D. Hoffmann F.M. Blackman R.K. Segal D. Grimaila R. Padgett R.W. Irick H.A. Gelbart W.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1114-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Like the dpp transcript, the Bmp2 transcript has an unusually long 5′-untranslated region of 1,125 nucleotides that might contain as yet uncharacterized regulatory elements. SinceBmp2 and dpp are pivotal developmental genes, their spatial and temporal expression must be tightly regulated. We have demonstrated here that tissue-specific promoters are one mechanism involved in this tight regulation. We have shown that this promoter and 1,709 base pairs of flanking region drive RA-dependent reporter gene expression in F9 cells. RA, which induces primitive endoderm differentiation, and RA and CT (dibutyryl cyclic AMP and theophylline), which induce parietal endoderm differentiation, caused equal activation of the CAT reporter gene (Fig. 3 B). The endogenous Bmp2 RNA is undetectable in undifferentiated cells and is induced modestly in RA-treated cells. In contrast, although CT does not induce differentiation and has no effect on Bmp2 mRNA abundance, the combination of RA and CT induces the message abundance strikingly. Thus, sequence outside of −3,367 to −1,658 must contain the elements responsible for the synergistic activity of RA and cAMP. Our demonstration that a 57-bp fragment of Bmp2 genomic DNA can drive the expression of a β-galactosidase reporter gene in yeast transformed with retinoid receptors strongly suggests that this gene is directly regulated by receptor binding. The RAR/RXR heterodimer in the presence of ligands that activate both subunits activated theBmp2-driven reporter most efficiently (Fig. 4 C). Similar synergy has been observed for many genes in mammalian cells, including Hoxa1 and the RARβ gene (42Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J. Zusi C. Ostrowski J. Reczek P. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A requirement for specific receptor combinations and specific ligand activities may mediate the tight regulation of developmentally crucial genes such asBmp2. Known retinoic acid-responsive elements are highly polymorphic and conform loosely to the form of two repeated half-sites separated by nonconserved “spacer” DNA: RG(G/T)TCAN5RG(G/T)TCA (22Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar). Although the most frequent forms are direct repeats separated by 5 base pairs (N), some RAREs consist of inverted repeats, much wider spacing, and diverse arrangements of half-sites. Since the 57-bpBmp2 RARE lacks identity to any previously described RAREs, point mutational analyses will be necessary to identify the precise sequences bound by retinoid receptors. Considering that the numerous combinations of the six retinoid receptors and their various isozymes have distinct ligand- and DNA-binding specificities and that over 200 genes are known to be modulated in retinoid-treated cells (48Gudas L. Sporn M. Roberts A. Sporn M. Roberts A. Goodman D. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry, and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar), many more types of functional RAREs are likely to be found. We thank Dr. M.A. Glozak for critical reading of this manuscript and Drs. D.

Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). One critical component of this signaling pathway is the cytoplasmic protein Armadillo/β-catenin, which is maintained at a low concentration in the free form in the cytoplasm. Wg/Wnt signaling raises the free β-catenin concentration to permit association with High Mobility Group (HMG)-box proteins of the T-cell Factor (Tcf)/Lymphoid Enhancer Factor (LEF) sub-family and translocation to the nucleus (2Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

First, genetic and biochemical studies inDrosophila suggest that larval midgut development depends on the Wg signal (8Hoppler S. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5016-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M.

Second, recent genetic evidence implicates homologs of Wg/Wnt signaling pathway components in gut development inCaenorhabditis elegans (10Rocheleau C.E. Downs W.D. Lin R. Wittmann C. Bei Y. Cha Y.

Finally, latency of cytoplasmic β-catenin may be maintained in part through the function of the product of the adenomatous polyposis coli(APC) gene (12Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O.

This potential role of APC in the Wg/Wnt signaling cascade likely reflects a critical function in maintaining gastrointestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Indeed, a fraction of colorectal tumors with intact APC harbor activating mutations in the β-catenin gene (15Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar), and at least one Tcf/LEF protein, human (h) Tcf-4, is commonly expressed in colon cancer cell lines and mediates transcriptional activation therein (16Korinek V.

The sum of these observations strongly implicates β-catenin and Tcf/LEF family proteins in normal gut development and in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tumors.The important question of how Wg/Wnt signaling achieves lineage-specific outcomes in diverse cell types remains unresolved and relies in part on a better understanding of the transcriptional effectors of the signaling pathway. In Drosophila, mutations in dTCF (also known as pangolin) result in phenotypes that are identical to those seen in wg mutants (9van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J.

The correspondence may, however, be more complicated in vertebrates, which have multiple Tcf/LEF-related proteins with varying patterns of expression in embryos and adults. Both Tcf-1 and LEF-1 were originally identified through studies in lymphocytes, where their expression is restricted in adult mice (18Travis A. Amsterdam A. Belanger C. Grosschedl R.

Oosterwegel M. Wilson A. MacDonald H.R. Clevers H. Nature. 1995; 374: 70-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), whereas LEF-1−/− mice manifest developmental abnormalities consistent with a role for LEF-1 in inductive interactions between mesenchymal and epithelial cells (22van Genderen C. Okamura R.M. Farinas I. Quo R.G. Parslow T.G. Bruhn L. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2691-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). Development of the gut has long been recognized to depend upon such inductive interactions but Tcf-1 and LEF-1 are not expressed in this organ and absence of either gene does not lead to obvious gut anomalies. Characterization of other members of this HMG-box protein subfamily has been less detailed, and the full extent of the subfamily is unknown.We sought to identify Tcf/LEF proteins that are expressed in the developing vertebrate gut and to examine their function in differentiation of the epithelium. Using degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cloning, we isolated a single Tcf/LEF family member as the dominant protein of this class in the developing mouse gut. The mRNA and predicted amino acid sequence of this clone are most closely related to those of hTcf-4, previously identified through near uniform expression in colon cancer cell lines (16Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar); during preparation of this report, Korinek et al. also reported the cloning of murine (m) Tcf-4 (24Korinek V. Barker N. Willert K. Molenaar M. Roose J. Wagenaar G. Markman M. Lamers W. Destree O. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1248-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In mouse embryos, expression of Tcf-4 mRNA is restricted to the gut epithelium and specific regions of the developing brain; in adults, expression is widespread, with highest levels observed in the liver, an embryonic midgut derivative. mTcf-4 mRNA possesses multiple alternative splice forms, the significance of which is presently unclear. Ectopic expression of one of these mTcf-4 mRNA isoforms in Xenopus embryos induces expression of gastrointestinal epithelial markers in isolated animal cap explants. These observations point to a possibly important function for Tcf-4 in differentiation of the gastrointestinal epithelium and vertebrate gut development.DISCUSSIONThe molecular mechanisms by which the endoderm-derived epithelial cells lining the aerodigestive tract differentiate are largely unknown. Several lines of evidence point to a role for Wg/Wnt signaling in differentiation of the gastrointestinal epithelium, including genetic studies in invertebrates (6Bienz M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Rocheleau C.E. Downs W.D. Lin R. Wittmann C. Bei Y. Cha Y. Ali M. Priess J.R. Mello C.C. Cell. 1997; 90: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and biochemical analysis of colon carcinomas (16Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). This raises the intriguing possibility that there are gut-specific components or modifiers of the Wnt signaling pathway that mediate tissue-specific responses. However, many of the components of this signaling pathway in gut epithelial cells are largely presumed on the basis of biochemical studies in other developmental systems. We have, therefore, focused on characterizing gut epithelium-specific aspects of Wnt signaling. Here we report that the predominant Tcf/LEF subfamily member present in the developing vertebrate gut is Tcf-4, which is only expressed here and in selected regions of the central nervous system during fetal development.mTcf-4 Structure and ExpressionMouse and human Tcf-4 are virtually identical at the amino acid level, at least in sequences N-terminal to the HMG box. The relationship of Tcf-4 to Tcf-1 extends to a remarkable similarity in splice variants and of a second reading frame in one of the terminal exons that encodes the isoform designated Tcf-4B. This potentially leads to considerable heterogeneity in the C termini of both proteins (32van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and its evolutionary conservation suggests that this may be of functional importance. Although the various C termini of Tcf-1 do not reveal detectable differences in transactivation properties in transient transfection assays (32van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), the Tcf-4 isoforms may well harbor functional heterogeneity that is relevant in vivo. Tcf-1 is also heterogeneous at the N terminus, in part reflecting use of alternate promoters (32van de Wetering M. Castrop J. Korinek V. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although we have not observed the same structure in mTcf-4 cDNAs isolated from the fetal gut, the major mRNA isoform present in the brain is distinct from that in other tissues (Fig. 5 A) and probably reflects 5′ heterogeneity; the precedent with Tcf-1 suggests that this also may represent dual promoter usage. The roughly equal frequency with which we isolated alternatively spliced clones suggests, but does not prove, that these splice variants are expressed in low but equal proportions in the fetal gut; our data do not address the existence or relative abundance of mTcf-4 splice variants in the brain.Recently, Korinek et al. (24Korinek V. Barker N. Willert K. Molenaar M. Roose J. Wagenaar G. Markman M. Lamers W. Destree O. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1248-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) reported cloning the mouse Tcf-4 gene, and our in situ hybridization studies confirm localization of fetal expression to the gut epithelium and di/mesencephalon. Whereas these investigators failed to detect appreciable mTcf-4 RNA levels in most adult tissues, however, we note that the gene is widely expressed postnatally, with highest levels in the liver, an endoderm-derived organ, and brain. The same pattern is seen in Northern analysis with either a full-length cDNA probe or one corresponding to a fragment of the 3′-UTR, which argues strongly in favor of specificity over cross-reactivity with related species. This apparent discrepancy is best explained by our use of high specific activity probes against Northern blots of poly(A)+ rather than total RNA. Indeed, Korinek et al. (24Korinek V. Barker N. Willert K. Molenaar M. Roose J. Wagenaar G. Markman M. Lamers W. Destree O. Clevers H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1248-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) readily detected mTcf-4 transcripts in poly(A)+ RNA isolated from various segments of the adult intestine, and we were also repeatedly frustrated in efforts to demonstrate expression outside the brain using total RNA. Thus, the expression pattern of Tcf-4 departs significantly from that of either Tcf-1 or LEF-1, both of which are expressed broadly during fetal development but restricted to lymphocytes in adult mice.The restricted fetal expression of Tcf-4 might suggest that it mediates essential aspects of signaling by Wnts or related molecules during development of the gut epithelium and, especially, of the diencephalon (thalamus), where expression levels are highest. Notably, at least 7 of the 16 known mammalian Wntgenes are expressed in various regions of the central nervous system and at least one of these, Wnt-1, is required for mid- and hind-brain development (33McMahon A.P. Bradley A. Cell. 1990; 62: 1073-1085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 34Thomas K.R. Capecchi M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 847-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The lack of brain abnormalities in mouse embryos lacking Tcf-1 or LEF-1 further hints at a possible requirement for Tcf-4 in central nervous system development or function.Tcf-4 FunctionOur most important finding pertains to the potential role of Tcf-4 in differentiation of endodermally derived tissues. Injection of mTcf-4 in the early Xenopus embryo leads to ectopic expression of endodermal and gut markers in animal cap explants; at sibling tadpole stages beyond 35–36, endodermin specifically marks endodermal derivatives in the gut (29Sasai Y. Lu B. Piccolo S. De Robertis E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4547-4555Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), whereas Xlhbox8 and IFABP are specific markers of the duodenum and pancreas (30Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and small intestine (31Shi Y.B. Hayes W.P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), respectively. This implicates Tcf-4 as functioning within a biochemical pathway that promotes gastrointestinal epithelial cell differentiation.Several aspects of this finding merit further discussion. First, the assay does not directly address the extent of cytodifferentiation promoted by Tcf-4; indeed, complete differentiation of endodermal derivatives in vivo is highly dependent on inductive interactions with mesenchyme (35Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 511-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and probably does not occur in isolated animal caps (26Jones E.A. Abel M.H. Woodland H.R. Roux Arch. Dev. Biol. 1993; 202: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, induction of Xlhbox8 mRNA, a specific marker of differentiated foregut derivatives (30Gamer L.W. Wright C.V.E. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggests that Tcf-4 might promote relatively advanced differentiation and may be particularly relevant to development of the pancreas. Second, the mechanism of cellular changes induced by Tcf-4 in the animal cap remains uncertain. Untreated animal caps differentiate into atypical, ciliated epidermis in isolation but retain considerable developmental plasticity early on. Ectopic expression of gastrointestinal markers in this tissue may reflect selective expansion of rare progenitor cells with intrinsic endodermal potential, realization of such potential in naive embryonic cells, or perhaps some combination of these possibilities; this consideration applies to all experiments withXenopus animal caps. Finally, loss-of-function studies, including gene targeting in mice, are necessary to establish a functional requirement for Tcf-4 in development of the endoderm and its derivatives in vivo. During the review of this manuscript, Korinek et al. reported that Tcf-4 knockout mice die at birth and their only detectable histopathologic abnormality is a reduced number of cells in small intestinal crypts, suggestive of a depleted stem cell compartment (36Korinek V. Barker N. Moerer P. van Donselaar E. Huls G. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). Together with the restricted fetal expression in mice, this observation and our gain-of-function studies in Xenopus implicate Tcf-4 as a regulator of the vertebrate gut epithelium. The similar results with either mRNA or DNA injection in Xenopus embryos further suggest that Tcf-4 can function in this capacity relatively late, i.e. after the mid-blastula transition, in embryonic development.Although genetic experiments in Drosophila suggest that dTcf/Pangolin exclusively subserves Wg signaling (9van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H.

Nature. 1997; 385: 829-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), it is entirely possible that in the vertebrate gut ligands other than Wnt signal through Tcf-4 to influence epithelial cell differentiation. The full complement of Wnt-related proteins expressed in the developing gut remains unknown, and several proteins without a known connection to Wnt signaling have also been implicated in endodermal and gut epithelial differentiation (37Bronner G. Chu-Lagraff Q. Doe C.Q. Cohen B. Weigel D. Taubert H. Jackle H. Nature. 1994; 369: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 38Suh E. Traber P.G. Mol. Cell.

The required inductive effect of adjacent mesenchyme for complete maturation of the gut epithelium (35Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 511-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) raises the further possibility that Tcf-4 is an effector for signals delivered by cell surface ligands. The interactions between the biochemical pathways involved in these processes and in gastrointestinal tumorigenesis remain to be determined. Identification of Tcf-4 as the predominant Tcf/LEF protein expressed in the developing and adult gut epithelium and its potential role in cytodifferentiation should facilitate molecular approaches to these questions.

Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). One critical component of this signaling pathway is the cytoplasmic protein Armadillo/β-catenin, which is maintained at a low concentration in the free form in the cytoplasm. Wg/Wnt signaling raises the free β-catenin concentration to permit association with High Mobility Group (HMG)-box proteins of the T-cell Factor (Tcf)/Lymphoid Enhancer Factor (LEF) sub-family and translocation to the nucleus (2Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

Rubenstein D. Peifer M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transcriptional targets of this signaling pathway include the developmentally regulated genes engrailed,siamois, labial, and ultrabithorax(5Brannon M. Gomperts M. Sumoy L. Moon R.T. Kimelman D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2359-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 6Bienz M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 7Riese J. Yu X. Munnerlyn A. Eresh S. Hsu S.-C. Grosschedl R. Bienz M. Cell. 1997; 88: 777-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), although many other genes are undoubtedly controlled through Wg/Wnt signaling in diverse cell types. Besides the established role of Wg/Wnt signaling in vertebrate mesodermal differentiation and axis formation and in development of the larval cuticle in Drosophila, several lines of evidence point to a role for this pathway in the differentiation of endodermal derivatives. First, genetic and biochemical studies inDrosophila suggest that larval midgut development depends on the Wg signal (8Hoppler S. Bienz M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5016-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J. Loureiro J. Ypma A. Hursh D. Jones T. Bejsovec A. Peifer M. Mortin M. Clevers H. Cell. 1997; 88: 789-799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Second, recent genetic evidence implicates homologs of Wg/Wnt signaling pathway components in gut development inCaenorhabditis elegans (10Rocheleau C.E. Downs W.D. Lin R. Wittmann C. Bei Y. Cha Y.

Cell. 1997; 90: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Finally, latency of cytoplasmic β-catenin may be maintained in part through the function of the product of the adenomatous polyposis coli(APC) gene (12Rubinfeld B. Souza B. Albert I. Muller O. Chamberlain S.H. Masiarz F.R. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1993; 262: 1731-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar, 13Su L.-K. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar), a frequent target of mutation in human colorectal and other gastrointestinal epithelial malignancies (14Powell S.M. Zilz N. Beazer-Barclay Y. Bryan T.M. Hamilton S.R. Thibodeau S.N. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Nature. 1992; 359: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). This potential role of APC in the Wg/Wnt signaling cascade likely reflects a critical function in maintaining gastrointestinal epithelial cell homeostasis. Indeed, a fraction of colorectal tumors with intact APC harbor activating mutations in the β-catenin gene (15Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar), and at least one Tcf/LEF protein, human (h) Tcf-4, is commonly expressed in colon cancer cell lines and mediates transcriptional activation therein (16Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2911) Google Scholar). The sum of these observations strongly implicates β-catenin and Tcf/LEF family proteins in normal gut development and in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal tumors. The important question of how Wg/Wnt signaling achieves lineage-specific outcomes in diverse cell types remains unresolved and relies in part on a better understanding of the transcriptional effectors of the signaling pathway. In Drosophila, mutations in dTCF (also known as pangolin) result in phenotypes that are identical to those seen in wg mutants (9van de Wetering M. Cavallo R. Dooijes D. van Beest M. van Es J.

MMPs are traditionally subdivided into four classes based on their substrate specificity: (i) interstitial collagenases; (ii) gelatinases or type IV collagenases; (iii) stromelysins, matrilysin, and metalloelastase; and (iv) membrane-type MMPs. This gene family taken as a whole can degrade all extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Therefore, they play a critical role in tissue remodeling during development and in pathophysiological processes, including inflammation, tissue repair, tumor invasion, and metastasis. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that gelatinases may degrade non-ECM components, such as myelin basic protein (1Gijbels K. Proost P. Masure S. Carton H. Billiau A. Opdenakker G. J.

Miszta-Lane H. Radomski M.W. Nature. 1997; 386: 616-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Except for MMP2, which is considered to be constitutively expressed, MMPs are highly regulated by growth factors, cytokines, hormones and extracellular matrix components. This regulation occurs at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels and also involves natural tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) (5Douglas D.M. Shi Y.E. Sang Q.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 237-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In kidney, MMP2 and MMP9 are present in early stages of development because the mesenchyme of 11-day embryonic kidney already synthesize both gelatinases (6Lelongt B. Trugnan G. Murphy G. Ronco P.M.

In contrast, blocking MMP9 activity with specific antibodies or TIMP1 impaired renal morphogenesis by inhibiting growth and branching of the ureteric bud, the embryonic epithelial precursor of the collecting duct (6Lelongt B.

In vitro cultures of proximal tubule and collecting duct epithelia showed secretion of both MMP2 and MMP9 (14Norman J.T. Gatti P.D. Lewis M. Exp. Nephrol. 1995; 3: 88-89PubMed Google Scholar,15Schaefer L. Han X. Gretz N. Häfner C. Meier K. Matzkies F. Schaefer R.M. Kidney Int. 1996; 49: 75-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the collecting duct epithelium is composed of three different cell types including principal cells and α- and β-intercalated cells, making it difficult to identify the cell type responsible for MMP secretion. We had previously established a rabbit collecting duct epithelial cell line (RC.SVtsA58) infected with the temperature-sensitive SV40 strain tsA58 (16Prié D. Ronco P.M. Baudouin B. Géniteau-Legendre M. Antoine M. Piedagnel R. Estrade S. Lelongt B. Verroust P.J. Cassingéna R. Vandewalle A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). When cultured at the permissive temperature of 33 °C (functional large-T antigen), cells display characteristics of transformed cells. After shifting the cells to the restrictive temperature of 39.5 °C (nonfunctional large-T antigen), cells stop dividing and acquire a differentiated phenotype characteristic of collecting duct principal cells including expression of functional type-2 arginine-vasopressin (AVP) receptors (16Prié D. Ronco P.M. Baudouin B. Géniteau-Legendre M. Antoine M. Piedagnel R. Estrade S. Lelongt B. Verroust P.J. Cassingéna R. Vandewalle A. J.

Profound alterations of the ECM were observed in dedifferentiated cells at 33 °C, including a marked transcriptional decrease of perlecan, a basement membrane proteoglycan (18Piedagnel R. Prié D. Cassingéna R. Ronco P.M. Lelongt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17469-17476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the basement membrane of renal tubules is mainly composed of type-IV collagen, we asked whether gelatinases could be produced by collecting duct cells and whether their expression could be increased by large-T. We took advantage of the duality of the RC.SVtsA58 cell line, that is the possibility to switch on or turn off SV40 large-T at each passage level, to determine the gelatinolytic profile of differentiated collecting duct principal cells and to analyze the regulation of MMPs by large-T and by AVP and epidermal growth factor (EGF), two physiological ligands of collecting duct principal cells. In addition, we established the in vivo expression of MMP2 and MMP9 at the apical pole of collecting duct cells, suggesting a specific role of these MMPs in the physiology of principal cells, irrespective of ECM remodeling. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Culture plastic dishes were purchased from Nunc (Roskilde, Denmark). Acrylamide and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis compounds were from Euromedex (Souffelweyersheim, France). Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane, Hybond-N, and Hybond-N+ nylon membrane were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Little Chalfort, United Kingdom). Proteinase inhibitors, type IV collagen,p-aminophenylmercuric acetate, levamisole, bovine skin gelatin, 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol, epidermal growth factor and arginine vasopressin were purchased from Sigma. Anti-human TIMP1 monoclonal antibody was obtained from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA). Horseradish peroxidase- and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-sheep antibodies were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). We used previously described IgGs from anti-human MMP2 and anti-pig MMP9 sheep sera (19Hipps D.S. Hembry R.M. Docherty A.J.P. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biol. Chem.

Gastineau M. Le Moal C. Poujeol P. Biol. Cell. 1992; 76: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and provided by M. Tauc (CNRS, Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France). The RC.SVtsA58 renal collecting duct cell line was generated by infection of a primary culture of isolated rabbit renal cortical cells with the SV40 temperature-sensitive mutant tsA58 (22Tegtmeyer P. J. Virol. 1972; 10: 591-598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were performed between the 30th and 60th passages following the protocol previously described (16Prié D. Ronco P.M. Baudouin B. Géniteau-Legendre M. Antoine M. Piedagnel R. Estrade S. Lelongt B. Verroust P.J. Cassingéna R. Vandewalle A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in uncoated Petri dishes or in 12-well plastic trays at a concentration of 2 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured to confluency (day 5) at the permissive temperature (33 °C) to allow functional expression of the large-T oncogene. The medium used was a serum-free hormonally defined medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 1:1 (v/v); transferrin, 5 μg/ml; sodium selenate, 30 nm; glutamine, 2 mm; dexamethasone, 5 × 10−8m; insulin, 5 μg/ml; HEPES, 20 mm, pH 7.4). On day 5, the medium was changed, and cell cultures were separated in two batches for the next 48 h: one batch was maintained at the permissive temperature, whereas the other one was transferred to the restrictive temperature of 39.5 °C. In some experiments, confluent cells were incubated for the last 24 h of culture with EGF (15 ng/ml) or AVP (10−7m). Cells and 48-h conditioned media were separately sampled on day 7 and kept at −20 °C until further analysis. To analyze the effects of temperature per se irrespective of the functional status of SV40 large-T oncogene on metalloproteinase synthesis, we used as control a rabbit collecting duct cell line of the same cell type origin (RC.SV3), previously established in our laboratory after infection of renal cells with the wild-type SV40 strain LP (23Vandewalle A. Lelongt B. Géniteau-Legendre M. Baudouin B. Antoine M. Estrade S. Châtelet F. Verroust P. Cassingéna R. Ronco P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 141: 203-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This cell line was studied under the same culture conditions as RC.SVtsA58 and analyzed at 33 and 39.5 °C. Finally, the effects of SV40 large-T oncogene on the gelatinase profile were also analyzed by re-infecting RC.SVtsA58 cells with a wild-type SV40 strain at the time of temperature shifting. Cells were seeded as described above in 12-well plastic trays, and after 5 days of culture, they were washed and either incubated with 300 μl of a stock solution containing SV40 strain LP (multiplicity of infection, 100 plaque-forming units/cell) or mock-infected (control cell population). After 3 h at 37 °C, 800 μl of hormonally defined medium were added, and cells were transferred for 48 or 72 h at 33 or 39.5 °C with one medium change at 24 h. Gelatinolytic activity was analyzed 48 and 72 h after re-infection or mock infection. Cell-associated and secreted proteinases were detected by zymography. 48-h conditioned media collected from cultures grown at 33 or 39.5 °C were centrifuged to remove cell debris. Cell layers of the same culture were lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% SDS, 5% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue). Both media and cell layers were then stored at −20 °C until further analysis. Lysates and conditioned media of ∼10,000 cells were subjected to electrophoresis under nonreducing condition in 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with 1 mg/ml gelatin or type IV collagen. Gels were washed twice for 30 min in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, incubated in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μmZnCl2, 0.01% NaN3, pH 7.5) overnight at 37 °C, stained in 0.5% Coomassie Blue G in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid for 30 min at room temperature and destained in 40% ethanol, 1% acetic acid. Clear proteolytic zones indicated the presence of gelatinases at their respective molecular weights. In some experiments, the active forms of gelatinases were induced by incubating the samples for 3 h at 37 °C with 1 mm p-aminophenyl mercuric acetate (APMA). All experiments were done at least 10 times. 14C acetylated gelatin assay and measurement of TIMP activity were performed exactly as described previously (24Murphy G. Cawston T.E. Galloway W.A. Barnes H.J. Bunning R.A.D. Mercer E. Reynolds J.J. Burgeson R.E. Biochem. J. 1981; 199: 807-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The unit of TIMP activity is the amount that will cause 50% inhibition of 2 units (μg collagen degraded/min) of collagenase. Conditioned media from cells cultured at 33 °C and 39.5 °C were concentrated approximately 70 times using Amicon microconcentrators with a 30-kDa cutoff. Samples were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 8% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose for 90 min at a constant current of 190 mA. Afterward, the nitrocellulose sheet was saturated with 5% dry milk in 0.1% PBS-Tween and 1 mm levamisole for 1 h at 37 °C, washed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-human MMP2 (2 μg/ml) or anti-pig MMP9 (2 μg/ml) sheep IgGs. This step was followed by a 2-h incubation at room temperature with an anti-sheep IgG antibody (0.2 μg/ml) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. Alkaline phosphatase activity was revealed by adding the nitro blue tetrazolium substrate (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate complex in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mmMgCl2, pH 9.5). The reaction was stopped in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Immunoblotting experiments were done at least three times. Expression of gelatinases was analyzed on cryostat rabbit kidney sections. Briefly, a New Zealand White rabbit was anesthetized, and its kidneys were perfused with PBS and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue sections (4 μm) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 10 min at room temperature, for 30 min in 50 mm NH4Cl, and further incubated for 30 min in a peroxidase suppressor reagent (Pierce) to neutralize endogenous peroxidases. They were then saturated with 10% dry milk diluted in PBS. Afterward, sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with sheep anti-MMP2 or anti-MMP9 IgG (10 μg/ml) diluted in PBS supplemented with 5% dry milk. They were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-sheep IgG antibody (dilution, 15 μg/ml). Enzyme activity was revealed with the 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazol substrate dissolved in 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.0, supplemented with 0.015% H2O2. Preparations were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined in a Leitz microscope. Confluent cells at 33 or 39.5 °C, cultured in standard conditions or stimulated with EGF or AVP, were lysed in 4 m guanidium thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.5% sarkosyl, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Total RNAs were then extracted as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (25Chomczynski B. Sacchi P. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63189) Google Scholar). 20 μg of RNA for each condition were then analyzed by Northern blot using a NorthernMaxTM kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, RNAs were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel under denaturing conditions and transferred for 2 h onto Hybond-N nylon membrane. The bluescript plasmid containing the rabbit MMP9 cDNA (26Tezuka K. Nemoto K. Tezuka Y. Sato T. Ikeda Y. Kobori M. Kawashima H. Eguchi H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15006-15009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was digested with smaI to excise a 1971-base pair cDNA fragment of MMP9. The resulting plasmid containing a 352-base pair 3′ fragment of rabbit MMP9 cDNA was used as a template to produce an antisense riboprobe. Transcription ofMMP9 antisense RNA was carried out with T7 polymerase using a RNA transcription kit (Ambion). Transferred RNAs were then hybridized overnight at 65 °C in a hybridization buffer provided with the kit, washed, and exposed to Fuji medical x-ray films at −80 °C. Northern blots were performed at least four times. Experiments were performed as described previously (18Piedagnel R. Prié D. Cassingéna R. Ronco P.M. Lelongt B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17469-17476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured in standard conditions or treated with EGF or AVP for 24 h were trypsinized and lysed in ice-cold 0.5% Nonidet-P40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10−6mantipain). Nuclei were isolated by centrifugation (700 ×g) and kept at −80 °C in glycerol storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 40% glycerol). For each culture condition, ∼107 nuclei were transcribed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 5 mmMgCl2; 150 mm KCl; 0.1 mm EDTA; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 10 mm creatine phosphate; 10 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase; 1500 units/ml RNasin; 1 mmeach ATP, GTP, and CTP; 100 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol). Reactions were terminated by treating nuclei with DNase I and proteinase K and labeled RNAs were extracted by phenol/chloroform. Plasmid Bluescript containing cDNA probes were linearized, blotted, and immobilized on Hybond N+ nylon membranes. cDNAs used were the full-length human MMP2 (27Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Seltzer J.L. Kronberger A. He C. Bauer E.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol.

Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15006-15009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the full-length rat GAPDH (28Fort P.H. Marty L. El Sabrouty S. Dani C.H. Jeanteur P.H. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar), and the full-length mouse actin (29Minty A.J. Alonso S. Guénet J.L. Buckingham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 137: 77-101Crossref Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized, washed, and exposed to Fuji medical x-ray films. Run-on experiments were performed at least three times. At the permissive temperature (33 °C), gelatin zymograms revealed a major zone of lysis at 68 kDa in conditioned media (Fig.1 A, lane 1) and in cell extracts (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). This zone corresponded to the migration of MMP2 identified by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). MMP2 activity normalized per cells number was markedly increased in conditioned media compared with cell extracts (Fig. 1 B, lane 1), suggesting that the enzyme was predominantly secreted. In conditioned media, the 68-kDa band of lysis was associated with a faint band at 62 kDa that became predominant upon incubation with APMA (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), an organomercurial compound that initiates conversion of the proenzymatic forms of MMPs into their active lower molecular weight forms. Therefore, the upper band of the doublet is most likely the latent form, whereas the lower is the active form of the enzyme. At the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C), cell-associated MMP2 activity increased (Fig. 1 B, lane 2), and the profile of secreted gelatinases was profoundly modified (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and 4). In addition to a 2-fold increase of MMP2 confirmed by Western blotting (Fig.1 D, lane 2), zymograms showed the appearance of a lytic zone at 90 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The anti-MMP-9 antibody identified a doublet at 90 and 88 kDa (Fig.1 D, lane 4). APMA treatment induced lower molecular mass bands, corresponding most likely to active forms of MMP9 as shown in Fig. 1 A, lane 4. The gelatinolytic pattern of RC.SVtsA58 conditioned media at 39.5 °C was similar to that of collecting duct cells in primary culture (Fig. 1 C), a finding that is in keeping with the differentiation process induced by shifting RC.SVtsA58 cells from 33 to 39.5 °C. Gelatinase activity was also measured in conditioned media using the14C-gelatin assay. No activity was detected in samples from RC.SVtsA58 cells kept at 33 °C, most likely because of lower sensitivity compared with zymography. By contrast, enzymatic activity was readily measurable in the media of cells shifted to 39.5 °C (0.75 units/ml/106 cells, n = 2). TIMP activity was 2–3-fold lower at 33 °C (0.32 units/ml/106cells, n = 2) than at 39.5 °C (0.73 units/ml/106 cells, n = 2). This result was confirmed by Western blot analysis of conditioned media with an antibody to TIMP1, the main inhibitor of MMP9 (data not shown). Taken as a whole, these results show that both transformed (RC.SVtsA58 at 33 °C) and differentiated (RC.SVtsA58 at 39.5 °C and primary cultures) collecting duct cells secrete MMP2, but MMP9 is produced only when cells are differentiated. The differentiation process is associated with a marked increase in gelatinolytic activity despite higher TIMP activity. To rule out an effect of the increase in temperature (irrespective of large-T functional activity) on MMP expression, we first studied the control cell line RC.SV3 derived from the same renal tubule cell population, but infected with a wild strain of SV40. Gelatinase activity in conditioned media of cells grown at 33 °C (Fig. 2 A,lane 1) or at 39.5 °C (Fig. 2 A, lane 2) was restricted to the proteolytic zone of MMP2, and it was not influenced by the culture temperature. In particular, shifting RC.SV3 cells to 39.5 °C did not induce the expression of MMP9, in keeping with the sustained activity of wild-type large-T oncogene at 39.5 °C. To confirm the inhibitory effect of large-T on MMPs, we re-infected RC.SVtsA58 cells with the wild-type SV40 strain LP at the time of temperature shifting. In cells transferred to 39.5 °C, induction of MMP9 was totally inhibited as early as 48 h after the temperature shift in SV40 strain LP-infected cells (Fig. 2 B, lane 4) compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 2 B,lane 3). In parallel, the increase in MMP2 activity was markedly blunted (Fig. 2 B, lane 3 versus lane 4). Re-infection did not affect the gelatinase pattern in cells maintained at 33 °C (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 2). Similar data were observed at 72 h (not shown). These results thus indicate that the changing pattern of gelatinase activity in RC.SVtsA58 cells does not result from a direct effect of temperature but is induced by SV40 large-T functional status. To determine whether expression of MMP2 and MMP9 by differentiated RC.SVtsA58 cells and collecting duct primary cultures was induced by culture conditions or could be considered as an additional marker of differentiation, we analyzed their distribution in the normal kidney by immunohistochemistry with the antibodies previously used for immunoblotting. Anti-MMP2 as well as anti-MMP9 antibodies stained tubule sections identified as collecting ducts because of the absence of brush border on phase contrast examination and their association by bunches of 4–5 units (Fig.3 A). All other nephron segments including glomeruli did not show appreciable labeling. However, a faint reactivity was observed in the kidney interstitium with anti-MMP2 antibody (Fig. 3 B). Thus, MMP2 and MMP9 are essentially expressed in the tubule segment from which the RC.SVtsA58 cell line originates. On higher magnification (Fig. 3, C andD), the two MMPs, although mostly implicated in ECM remodeling, were unexpectedly localized at the apical pole of collecting duct cells, suggesting the presence of receptors and/or substrates for these enzymes at the luminal pole of the cells. EGF and AVP are physiological ligands of principal cells that exert antagonistic hydroosmotic effects on the collecting duct (30Breyer M.D. Jacobson H.R. Breyer J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 82: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Harris R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: F1117-F1124PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the ability of these factors to regulate the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in RC.SVtsA58 cells. MMP2 expression analyzed by zymography (Fig.4 A) and Western blotting (Fig.4 B) in conditioned media of 33 and 39.5 °C cultures was not altered either by 15 ng/ml EGF (Fig. 4, A, lanes 2 and 5, and B, lanes 2 and4) or by 10−7m AVP (Fig.4 A, lanes 3 and 6), which induces a peak cyclic AMP response (16Prié D. Ronco P.M. Baudouin B. Géniteau-Legendre M. Antoine M. Piedagnel R. Estrade S. Lelongt B. Verroust P.J. Cassingéna R. Vandewalle A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast, EGF and AVP had dramatic effects on MMP9 expression. EGF induced MMP9 secretion by transformed cells (33 °C) (Fig. 4,A, lane 2, and C, lane 2). It also increased enzyme expression in differentiated cells at 39.5 °C (Fig. 4, A, lane 5, and C,lane 5). Concentration-response experiments indicated that MMP9 induction or stimulation in the two populations of cells (33 and 39.5 °C) occurred from 0.5 ng/ml (not shown). Cells cultured at the permissive temperature (33 °C) did not express AVP receptors (16Prié D. Ronco P.M. Baudouin B. Géniteau-Legendre M. Antoine M. Piedagnel R. Estrade S. Lelongt B. Verroust P.J. Cassingéna R. Vandewalle A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and, as expected, the effect of AVP was only observed in differentiated cells (39.5 °C) in which 10−7m AVP markedly inhibited MMP9 activity and antigen shown by zymography (Fig.4 A, lane 6) and Western blotting (Fig.4 C, lane 6), respectively. The mechanisms whereby MMP9 was differentially regulated by large-T, AVP and EGF were further investig"

We have explored molecular details of how the type III to type IV replacement process may occur. First, we have demonstrated by cross-linking experiments that bacterially expressed forms of α-internexin and vimentin form heterodimer molecules in vitro that assemble into copolymer intermediate filaments. We show using a urea disassembly assay that α-internexin molecules are likely to be more stable than those of vimentin. Second, by analyses of the induced cross-links, we have determined the axial lengths of α-internexin homodimer and α-internexin-vimentin heterodimer molecules and their modes of alignments in filaments. We report that these dimensions are the same as those reported earlier for vimentin homopolymer molecules and, by implication, are also the same for the other neuronal type IV proteins. These data suggest that during neuronal development, α-internexin molecules are readily assimilated onto the pre-existing vimentin cytoskeletal intermediate filament network because the axial lengths and axial alignments of their molecules are the same. Furthermore, the dynamic replacement process may be driven by a positive equilibrium due to the increased stability of the α-internexin network.

Landes Co., Austin, TX1995Google Scholar). Although a great deal is known about their protein complexity, composition, and expression characteristics during development and differentiation, comparatively less is known about IF structure and how this relates to their dynamism and functions in cells. Established data report that IF are built in an hierarchical manner. First, two compatible protein chains form a dimer molecule in which four well conserved α-helical sequences along a central rod domain of each chain associate in parallel and in register to make a segmented coiled-coil molecule (4Parry D.A.D.

Determination of the exact alignments of the A11 and A22 modes has revealed a fourth mode termed ACN, in which the end of one molecule is overlapped by about 1 nm with the beginning of the next parallel molecule in the same axial row. Third, quantitative mass measurements suggest that 12–24 molecules, most commonly 16 in native IF (13Steven A.C. Wall J.S. Hainfeld J. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, whereas most or all cytoplasmic IF appear morphologically similar in vivo or when reconstituted in vitro, there are complex variations in at least the first two of these hierarchical steps. In step one, the coiled-coil molecule may be either an obligatory heterodimer (all type I/II keratin chains) (6Steinert P.M. J. Biol.

In the second step, we have found that the exact axial alignments of the three nearest-neighbor assembly modes identified above vary between the different IF types. All cytokeratin molecules seem to be aligned the same way (10Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D.B. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The consequence of this is that these chain types cannot and do not copolymerize in vitro, or in vivo, so that certain cells that co-express keratins and vimentin, for example, have elaborated different cytoplasmic IF networks (27Goldman R.D. Zackroff R.V. Steinert P.M. Goldman R.D. Steinert P.M. Cellular and Molecular Biology of Intermediate Filaments. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1990: 3-17Crossref Google Scholar). A related complexity arises in cells and tissues during development. Many embryonic or immature differentiating cell types express first one type of IF chain and then replace it in a dynamic exchange/replacement process (28Steinert P.M. Liem R.K.H. Cell. 1990; 60: 521-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) as differentiation proceeds. A cogent example of this are neuronal cells (reviewed in Ref. 29Liem R.K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Neuroectodermal stem cells initially express the type VI IF chain nestin (30Lendahl U. Zimmerman L.B. McKay R.D.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 585-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2765) Google Scholar) alone or with type III vimentin (central nervous system) (31Tapscott S.J. Bennett G.S. Toyama F. Kleinbart F.

Cytochem. 1995; 43: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). When the stem cells become postmitotic, transcription of types VI and III IF genes diminishes, and they are replaced by the first of a series of type IV neuronal IF chains, α-internexin (37Pachter J.S.

Neurol. 1994; 342: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which in turn is largely replaced by the other type IV chains including the NF-L, NF-M, and finally the NF-H chains as mature neurons are formed (25Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 41Hoffman P.N. Lasek R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 66: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). To date there is considerable evidence from co-expression and co-transfection experiments for copolymerization of these different chain types onto the same IF networks or even individual IF in living cells (Refs.21van den Heuvel R.M.M. van Eys G.J.J.M.

Cell. 1990; 60: 585-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2765) Google Scholar). However, certain molecular details of these changes in IF composition remain unclear. It has not been determined yet whether type III vimentin or peripherin and type IV α-internexin copolymerize into the same IF and, if so, at which level of IF hierarchy: does this occur at the dimer (that is homo-versus heterodimer) or tetramer (that is different pairs of homodimers) (4Parry D.A.D. Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 127: 1012-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 42Cohlberg J.A. Hajarian H. Tran T. Alipourjeddi P. Noveen A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 31073-31078Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or higher (45Hisanaga S.-I. Ikai A. Hirokawa N. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 857-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar)? As a first step toward addressing the issue of type replacement during development, we have previously demonstrated that different keratin chain pairs can easily substitute for one another during differentiation because keratin molecules possess the same dimensions and align themselves in the same way (11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10046-10056Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The related question thus arises as to how the type III vimentin network in neuronal cells can be substituted by the series of type IV chains during neuronal development. To address this question, we have explored in vitro the co-assembly properties of the type IV IF chain α-internexin with type III vimentin. We show by cross-linking experiments for the first time that these chain types can indeed co-assemble to form heterodimers and that heterodimers or homodimers of them may then participate to form IF. This then allowed us to perform further cross-linking experiments to establish that their precise molecular alignments are in fact the same. A vector containing the full-length coding sequence of rat α-internexin in the pET11a system was a generous gift of Dr. Ron Liem (46Ching G.Y. Liem R.K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19459-19468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vector expresses a product with an additional 14-amino acid sequence on the head domain of α-internexin derived from the T7 10 promoter. Following transformation into the host Escherichia coli B strain BL 21/DE3 pLys(S) (Novagen), cultures (0.5–1-liter volume) were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin toA 600 nm of 0.6, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. The α-internexin was recovered and purified from bacterial pellets (10,000 × g for 30 min) as described (47Isenberg G. Cytoskeletal Proteins: A Purification Manual. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1995: 218-219Google Scholar). The yield was about 20 mg/liter of bacterial growth. In one experiment,35S-labeled methionine (1000 Ci/mmol) was added during protein expression (0.5 μCi/ml of medium) to yield protein of 86 dpm/μg. The purified protein was stored at −70 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% SDS, freed of SDS by ion-pair extraction (48Konigsberg W.H. Henderson L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 254-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and redissolved in a desired buffer (see below) containing 9.5 m urea immediately prior to use. Purified bacterially expressed human vimentin was a generous gift of Dr. Robert Goldman and was stored and prepared for use as above. The conditions used for assembly of α-internexin were essentially identical to those described previously (37Pachter J.S. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Kaplan M.P. Chin S.-S. Fliegner K.H. Liem R.K.H. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 278Google Scholar), at 0.2–0.5 mg/ml using a buffer containing 10 mm triethanolamine HCl in the pH range of 6.7–8.0, 0.17m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Vimentin assembly was done at 0.2–0.5 mg/ml in a similar triethanolamine HCl buffer but at pH 7.4–8.0 (16Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Cabral F. Gottesman M.M. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3692-3696Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Ip W. Hartzer M.K. Pang Y.Y. Robson R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). α-Internexin and vimentin co-assembly experiments were done in similar buffers at pH 7.0–8.0. Solutions of expressed proteins in 9.5 or 6 m urea either singly or mixed as required were dialyzed twice against 1000 volumes of the buffer of choice. In all assembly experiments, protein exposure to concentrated urea solutions was kept to a minimum (≤4 h). Samples were examined by negative staining with uranyl acetate on glow-discharged carbon-coated grids (50Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Zimmerman S.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 108: 547-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Cross-linking was performed using the periodate-cleavable bifunctional cross-linking reagent disulfosuccinimidyl tartrate (DST) as described previously (10Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D.B. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10046-10056Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before reaction, the pH of the triethanolamine HCl buffers was raised to 8.0. Cleavage was done by making desired protein solutions to 0.1m sodium periodate and reaction for 1 h at room temperature. In trial cross-linking experiments to determine molecular alignments, the amount of DST used ranged from 0.1 to 1 mm, but we found that 0.15 mm gave the most reproducible results; at higher concentrations, it appeared that the numerous lysine residues of the tail domain of α-internexin produced multiple random and nonspecific cross-linked products with rod domain lysines. Using an iodoacetamide titration assay (11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10046-10056Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), only about 5% of the ε-NH2 groups of lysines were modified under these conditions. Thus we were able to achieve a very high degree of cross-linking specificity, but the molar yield of cross-linked peptides was quite low. Reactions were done for 30 min, stopped by quenching in 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (final concentration), and dried. We performed cross-linking reactions on homopolymeric α-internexin IF, oligomers of α-internexin (primarily homodimers and homopolymers estimated to be 16-mers (49Abumuhor I. Spencer P. Cohlberg J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 278Google Scholar)) formed in the absence of 0.17 m NaCl, and IF formed in mixtures of 70% α-internexin and 30% vimentin in 0.17 m NaCl. Following cross-linking, the products were resolved on 3-mm thick slab gels. The homodimer and homopolymer bands were eluted, freed of glycine salts, and dried. In cross-linking experiments performed in concentrated urea buffers to examine molecular stabilities, we used 0.1 m DST instead to overcome the trace amounts of NH4+ ions in the urea solutions. In this case, to minimize cross-linking of collision complexes, the protein concentrations used were reduced 10-fold to 25–40 μg/ml. In trial experiments, we found that the extensive degree of protein modification that occurred under these conditions changed the mobilities of the monomer and dimer bands by <10%. α-Internexin or vimentin were equilibrated in the pH 8.0 buffer (50 μl) of desired urea concentration for 1 h at room temperature before addition of the DST, reacted and terminated as above, and made to 2% SDS in sample buffer before electrophoresis on 3.75–7.5% gradient PAGE gels. To examine formation of heterodimers in mixing experiments, copolymer IF were assembled as described above, pelleted at 100,000 ×g for 30 min in a Beckman Airfuge, and amounts in pellets, that is assembly efficiencies, were determined either spectrophotometrically or by amino acid analysis after acid hydrolysis. The pellets were redissolved in 10 mm triethanolamine HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 6 m urea (10–40 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature before addition of the DST to 0.1m. Alternatively, mixtures in 9.5 m urea were dialyzed into 6 m urea buffer for 2 h at room temperature before cross-linking as above. In these two cases, the terminated reactions were resolved on shallow 5–7.5% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Coomassie-stained gels were scanned with a densitometer. Quantitative data were obtained after normalization of staining intensities of 0.1–1-μg amounts of α-internexin and vimentin on control gels. Alternatively, gels were examined after Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against either vimentin (Boehringer Mannhiem) or α-internexin (a kind gift of Dr. Liem) and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The dried DST cross-linked products and untreated α-internexin or vimentin were redissolved (1 mg/ml) in 70% aqueous formic acid and reacted with a 1:1 weight of protein:CNBr overnight. Following drying, the reactions were digested to completion with trypsin (Sigma, bovine, sequencing grade) using 2% enzyme for 6 h at 37 °C, at which time another 1% was added for a further 12 h. Peptides were resolved by reverse-phase HPLC as before (10Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D.B. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 436-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Parry D.A.D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24916-24925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Potential DST cross-linked peaks were identified by comparisons of profiles before and after cross-linking and then harvested preparatively. When necessary, peaks were purified by a second run. An aliquot of each candidate peak was cleaved with periodate, and the products resolved by HPLC. When two peaks were obtained, they were each subjected to Edman sequencing in a Porton LF-3000 sequencer. When only one peak was obtained, another uncleaved aliquot was used to measure the amount by amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis, and a third aliquot was used for sequencing. In this way, it could be determined whether the single-cleaved product peak contained only one uncross-linked peptide, or two peptides that were cross-linked together but could not be resolved by HPLC, or contained a peptide cross-linked to itself. By a combination of these methods, the lysine residues involved in cross-links could be unequivocally identified. Copolymer IF (0.2–0.4 mg/ml) were digested by dripping during a 30-s period into a solution of trypsin (Sigma, sequencing grade) in a buffer of 50 mm triethanolamine HCl (pH 8.0) to achieve a net protein:enzyme ratio of 100:1, and the digestion continued for 10–17 min at room temperature (8Steinert P.M.

Tetramer and dimer α-helix-enriched particles were recovered by precipitation at pH 5.2 with 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate, collected by centrifugation, and resolved by chromatography on a 20 × 1-cm column of Sepharose 6B equilibrated in a buffer of 50 mmsodium tetraborate (pH 9.2). The fractions eluted in peak 3 consisting of 2B dimers were collected by reprecipitation at pH 5.2. Aliquots were cross-linked with 0.1 m DST as above, and the products were resolved on 5–10% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. Aliquots were also chromatographed by FPLC on a 5 × 1-cm column of MonoQ equilibrated in the borate buffer and eluted with 50 ml of a 0–0.15m KCl gradient. Samples of each of the three peaks were sequenced. Each of the cross-links could be assigned by simple inspection to one of four modes (see Figs.6 and 7); one group arose from intramolecular cross-links across the α-internexin homodimer or α-internexin-vimentin heterodimer. Each of the others could be assigned to one of three groups that arose from intermolecular cross-links established previously for epidermal keratin (10Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. Fraser R.D.B.

In this casegreen designates the vimentin chain in the α-internexin-vimentin heterodimer in each of the alignment modes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Vimentin IF assembled in vitro in buffers of pH 7.4 to 8.0 were long (>20 μm) smooth-walled structures uniformly 10 nm in diameter (Fig. 1 A). Optimal assembly of α-internexin occurred at pH 6.7, but IF were much shorter (0.5–2 μm) and somewhat irregular in width (8–15 nm) and appearance (Fig. 1 B). Also, irrespective of the protein concentration used for assembly, some particles were only 60–100 nm long, described previously as “half-thickness unit-length” molecular aggregates that contain 16 chains (49Abumuhor I. Spencer P. Cohlberg J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 278Google Scholar). Above pH 7.0, such particles predominated (Fig. 1 C, at pH 8.0). These characteristics for α-internexin IF have been reported previously (37Pachter J.S. Liem R.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1316-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 39Kaplan M.P.

Mixtures of α-internexin with 25 (Fig. 1 D), 50, or 75% vimentin formed IF that were longer at pH 7.0 (Fig.1 D) than at pH 8.0 (Fig. 1 E) and appeared more like vimentin IF alone, since there were very few short particles and most were regularly shaped. Similar images for α-internexin and vimentin IF were obtained when assembled from either 9.5 or 6m urea (data not shown). Together, these studies indicate that the bacterially expressed proteins are indeed co-assembly capable and, moreover, encouraged us to explore further the hierarchical level of IF structure at which the type III vimentin and type IV α-internexin co-assembled. Two high molecular weight bands of protein were observed when vimentin (Fig.2 A) or α-internexin (Fig.2 B) at 25 or 250 μg/ml (data not shown) in pH 8.0 buffer were assembled in the presence of 0.17 m NaCl, followed by cross-linking with 0.1 m DST. Irrespective of the protein concentration, in the absence of salt, vimentin formed primarily tetramers and some higher oligomers, as expected (16Steinert P.M. Idler W.W. Cabral F. Gottesman M.M.

https://openalex.org/W2120415793,"Nonhistone chromosomal proteins of the high mobility group (HMG) affect the transcriptional regulation of certain mammalian genes. For example, HMG-I(Y) controls cytokine-mediated promoters that require transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-κB, for maximal expression. Even though a great deal is known about how HMG-I(Y) facilitates expression of other genes, less is known about the regulation of HMG-I(Y) itself, especially in cells in primary culture. Therefore we investigated the effect of endotoxin and the cytokine interleukin-1β on HMG-I(Y) expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Induction of HMG-I(Y) peaked after 48 h of interleukin-1β stimulation (6.2-fold) in cells in primary culture, and this increase in mRNA corresponded to an increase in HMG-I(Y) protein. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining revealed a dramatic increase in HMG-I(Y) protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells after endotoxin stimulation in vivo. This increase in HMG-I(Y) expression (both in vitro and in vivo) mirrored an up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, a cytokine-responsive gene. The functional significance of this coinduction is underscored by our finding that HMG-I(Y) potentiated the response of inducible nitric oxide synthase to nuclear factor-κB transactivation. Taken together, these studies suggest that induction of HMG-I(Y), and subsequent transactivation of iNOS, may contribute to a reduction in vascular tone during endotoxemia and other systemic inflammatory processes.

Lehn D.A. Landsman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1049: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 2Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J.

HMG proteins contribute to the regulation of gene expression by serving as architectural factors that alter chromatin structure (4Grosschedl R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). An important member of this family is HMG-I(Y). HMG-I(Y) refers to two proteins, HMG-I and HMG-Y, that are derived by alternative splicing of the same gene (5Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338-18342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological functions of the two proteins are indistinguishable. HMG-I(Y) binds to AT-rich regions in the minor groove of DNA via motifs known as AT-hooks (6Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby facilitating the assembly of functional nucleoprotein complexes (enhanceosomes). This assembly is promoted by modifying DNA conformation and by recruiting nuclear proteins to an enhancer (7Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). By binding to DNA and altering chromatin structure, HMG-I(Y) can have positive or negative effects on transcription factor binding to promoter regions (3Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The role of HMG-I(Y) in enhanceosome assembly during viral induction of the interferon (IFN)-β gene has been studied extensively (7Falvo J.V. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1101-1111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 9Thanos D. Maniatis T.

HMG-I(Y) binds to positive regulatory domains in the IFN-β enhancer, reverses an intrinsic bend in the DNA, and recruits transcription factors to their binding sites to have a positive effect on transcription during viral stimulation. Factors recruited by HMG-I(Y) include nuclear factor (NF)-κB, ATF-2/c-Jun, and IRF-1 (11Thanos D. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 152-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 119-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Other genes that require NF-κB and HMG-I(Y) for full transcriptional activation include E-selectin (13Lewis H. Kaszubska W. DeLamarter J.F. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Read M.A. Maniatis T. Collins T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6464-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and the chemokine melanoma growth stimulatory activity/growth related protein α (MGSA/GROα) (15Wood L.D. Farmer A.A. Richmond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4210-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). E-selectin and MGSA/GROα are cytokine-responsive genes critical to mediation of inflammation. E-selectin affects the interaction of leukocytes with the vascular wall during an inflammatory response (16Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar), and MGSA/GROα is a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils (15Wood L.D. Farmer A.A. Richmond A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4210-4219Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that HMG-I(Y) may be important for full induction of cytokine-driven promoters that require NF-κB for activation. Thus, the ability of HMG-I(Y) to assemble higher order transcription factor complexes may be important during systemic inflammatory responses. Sepsis is a disease process that results from an overwhelming inflammatory response due to severe infection (17Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1991; 115: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 18Bone R.C. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1992; 268: 3452-3455Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 19Parrillo J.E. Parker M.M.

Med. 1993; 328: 1471-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). During Gram-negative bacterial infection, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or endotoxin is released from the bacterial cell wall to activate the immune cells of the host. These immune cells, which include macrophages, then release proinflammatory cytokines. When proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, are released in exaggerated amounts, the result is hypotension and shock (17Bone R.C. Ann. Intern. Med. 1991; 115: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 19Parrillo J.E. Parker M.M. Natanson C. Suffredini A.F. Danner R.L. Cunnion R.E. Ognibene F.P. Ann. Intern. Med. 1990; 113: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). An important mediator of this cytokine-induced hypotensive response is the potent vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) (21MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Hom G. Chartrain N. Fletcher D.S. Trumbauer M. Stevens K. Xie Q.W. Sokol K. Hutchinson N. Chen H. Mudgett J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 641-650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar, 22Wei X.-q. Charles I.G. Smith A. Ure J. Feng G.-j. Huang F.-p. Xu D. Muller W. Monocada S. Liew F.Y. Nature. 1995; 375: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Generation of NO under these circumstances is regulated by the inducible isoform of NO synthase (iNOS or NOS2). As it does in the induction of IFN-β by viral stimulation and E-selectin and MGSA/GROα by cytokine stimulation, NF-κB plays a critical role in the activation of iNOS (23Xie Q. Kashiwabara Y. Nathan C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4705-4708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent experiments have emphasized the importance of NF-κB binding activity in the pathophysiology of sepsis (24Böhrer H. Qiu F. Zimmermann T. Zhang Y. Jllmer T. Mannel D. Bottiger B.W. Stern D.M. Waldherr R. Saeger H.D. Ziegler R. Bierhaus A. Martin E. Nawroth P.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 972-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In addition to a role for HMG-I(Y) in the transcriptional regulation of genes, previous studies have shown an association between high levels of HMG-I(Y) and the neoplastic transformation of cells. HMG-I(Y) is up-regulated in malignant tumors (25Giancotti V. Berlingieri M.T. DiFiore P.P. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Crane-Robinson C. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 6051-6057PubMed Google Scholar, 26Giancotti V.

Little is known, however, about the regulation of HMG-I(Y) expression in nontransformed or nonmalignant cells. For example, we do not know how endotoxin and proinflammatory cytokines influence HMG-I(Y) in vascular smooth muscle cells (which are important for the regulation of vascular tone) or what the significance is of an up-regulation in HMG-I(Y)—and its potential influence on genes, such as iNOS, that regulate vascular tone—during systemic inflammatory processes. In investigating the regulation of HMG-I(Y) in vascular smooth muscle cells in vitro and in vivo, our goals in the present study were to 1) determine whether the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β regulated HMG-I(Y) mRNA and protein in primary cell cultures, 2) determine whether such a response also occurred in smooth muscle cells of the blood vessel wall after endotoxin stimulationin vivo, 3) determine whether regulation of HMG-I(Y) correlated with induction of iNOS, and 4) determine whether HMG-I(Y) plays a role in the activation of iNOS gene transcription. Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) were harvested from male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Gunther et al. (31Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (J. R. H. Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) (Sigma) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C. RASMCs were passaged every 4–5 days, and experiments were performed on cells 4–6 passages from primary culture. Alveolar macrophages were harvested from the lungs of male Sprague-Dawley rats as described (32Pierce L.M. Alessandrini F. Godleski J.J. Paulauskis J.D. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1996; 138: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Wright-Giemsa staining revealed that >95% of the cells were normal lung macrophages. The cells were suspended in RPMI 1640 medium (J. R. H. Biosciences) supplemented with 2% heat-inactivated fetal horse serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C.Drosophila SL2 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) (33Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained at 23 °C in Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) supplemented with 12% heat-inactivated FBS and gentamycin (50 μg/ml). SL2 cells were passaged every 4 days. Total RNA was obtained from rat aortas, after removal of adventitial tissue, and from cultured RASMCs and rat alveolar macrophages by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifugation through cesium chloride (34Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized at 68 °C for 2 h with32P-labeled mouse HMG-I(Y) and rat iNOS (35Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

The hybridized filters were then washed in 30 mm sodium chloride, 3 mm sodium citrate, and 0.1% SDS solution at 55 °C and autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film at –80 °C for 8–12 h or stored on phosphor screens for 2–4 h. To correct for differences in RNA loading, the filters were washed in a 50% formamide solution at 80 °C and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to 18 S ribosomal RNA. Images were displayed and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To evaluate the effect of IL-1β on HMG-I(Y) transcription in vascular smooth muscle cells, plasmid Δ180 was used (36Ogram S.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14235-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This construct, cloned into pCAT-Basic, contained the second transcription start site of HMG-I(Y) (36Ogram S.A. Reeves R. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 4259-4267Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Plasmid pGL2-Control contained the firefly luciferase gene driven by an SV40 promoter and enhancer. To evaluate iNOS promoter activity in either vascular smooth muscle cells or SL2 cells, we inserted 1485 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse iNOS gene and the first 31 base pairs after the transcription start site into pGL2-Basic to make iNOS(–1485/+31), as described (38Perrella M.A. Patterson C.

Plasmid iNOS(–1485/+31 NF-κBm), which contained a mutated downstream NF-κB site (–85 to –83, GGG to CTC) (38Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

Plasmid pPAC has been described elsewhere (10Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 39Courey A.J. Tijan R.

Plasmid pOPRSVI-CAT contained the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene driven by a Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeats promoter, and plasmid –438SmLIM has been described elsewhere (41Yet S.-F. Folta S.C. Jain M.K. Hsieh C.-M. Maemura K. Layne M.D. Zhang D. Marria P.B. Yoshizumi M. Chin M.T. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol.

In brief, 500,000 cells were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 48–72 h (until 80–90% confluent). Then, plasmids Δ180 and pGL2-Control (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) were added (5 μg each) to the RASMCs in a solution containing 500 μg/ml of DEAE-dextran. RASMCs were subsequently shocked with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide solution for 1 min and then allowed to recover in medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. Twelve hours after transfection, RASMCs were placed in 2% FBS. RASMCs were then stimulated with vehicle or human recombinant IL-1β (10 ng/ml) (Beckton Dickinson, Los Angeles, CA) for 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared by detergent lysis (Promega), and CAT assays were performed by a modified two-phase fluor diffusion method as described (42Lee M.-E. Bloch K.D. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Fen Z. Dhadly M.S. Yoshizumi M. Hilkert R.J. Quertermous T. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Lee M.-E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7932-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured with an EG&G AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Gaithersburg, MD) and the Promega Luciferase Assay system to assess efficiency of transfection. The ratio of CAT to luciferase activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized CAT activity. To assess the effect of distamycin A (Sigma) on iNOS promoter induction by IL-1β, we transfected RASMCs by the DEAE-dextran method described above. Plasmid iNOS(–1485/+31) or –438SmLIM (5 μg) was transfected with pOPRSVI-CAT (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) into the RASMCs. Twelve hours after transfection, the cells were placed in 2% FBS and incubated with the maximal stimulatory dose of IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 24 h in the presence or absence of distamycin A (5 μm). The cells were subsequently harvested and analyzed for luciferase and CAT activity. In these experiments, the ratio of luciferase to CAT activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. SL2 cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate method according to Di Nocera and Dawid (44Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In brief, SL2 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes (Costar Corp.) 24 h before transfection. Plasmids iNOS(–1485/+31) and iNOS(–1485/+31 NF-κBm) were added at 1 μg/well. Plasmids p50-pPAC, p65-pPAC, and phsp82LacZ were added at 100 ng/well. Plasmid pPACHMGI was added at 0.1, 0.5, or 1 μg/well, alone or in combination with p50-pPAC and p65-pPAC. Forty-eight hours after the initial transfection, extracts from the SL2 cells were prepared and luciferase activity was measured as described for RASMCs. β-Galactosidase assays, to assess transfection efficiency, were performed as described elsewhere (45Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.-M. Zhou F. Tsai J.-C. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3266-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity to β-galactosidase activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. RASMCs were plated in 150-mm tissue culture dishes (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). When the cells were 80–90% confluent, the 10% FBS medium was replaced with 0.4% bovine serum medium. After 48 h, vehicle or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) was added to the cells. RASMCs were then collected in phosphate-buffered saline solution with a cell scraper 48 h later. HMG-I(Y) protein was obtained from RASMCs by acidic extraction followed by trichloroacetic acid precipitation (46Lundberg K. Karlson J.R. Ingebrigtsen K. Holtlund J. Lund T. Laland S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1009: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resulting protein pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of high pressure liquid chromatography-grade water and stored at –20 °C until it was assayed. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by mixing 10 μl of the resuspended acidic extract with 10 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (2×). After 5 min of boiling, the samples were resolved on a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) overnight. The membrane was blocked with 10% skim milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. It was then incubated with anti-HMG-I(Y) antibody N19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 0.1 μg/ml in 5% skim milk in TBS-T for 2 h at room temperature. After a wash in TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with anti-goat, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) under the same conditions used for the primary antibody. After a final wash in TBS-T, the blot was developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Because the extraction also led to the isolation of histone H1, under transfer conditions insufficient for removal of H1 from the gel, we used the histone H1 band to correct for differences in protein loading. After scanning, the intensities of the HMG-I(Y) band and the Coomassie Blue-stained histone H1 band were measured with the NIH Image software, and the ratio of the two values was used to represent the normalized intensity of the HMG-I(Y) band. Aortic samples were collected and frozen. Sections were cut to a thickness of 5 μm, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were then incubated in 10% goat serum for 20 min at room temperature. Sections were next incubated with anti-HMG-I(Y) antibody (N19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 0.25 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline-0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C. Control sections were incubated under the same conditions with normal goat IgG (Research & Diagnostic Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at 0.25 μg/ml. After a wash, sections were incubated with biotinylated rabbit anti-goat antibody (Vectastain ABC, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 1.5 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline-0.4% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. After they had been incubated with avidin, the sections were developed with a peroxidase 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) kit (Vector Laboratories). To ensure specificity of staining, we treated a series of sections from the same animals with anti-HMG-I(Y) antibody N19 that had been preincubated for 1 h at room temperature with the synthetic peptide (40 μg/ml) used to raise it. The peptide represents amino acids 2–20 of the HMG-I(Y) sequence (ESSSKSSQPLASKQEKDGT, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) were treated with vehicle or Salmonella typhosa LPS (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, Sigma). Nine hours later, we harvested the aortas and processed them as described for use in Northern blot analyses or immunohistochemical staining. Data from the SL2 cell transfection experiments were subjected to analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's test. Significance was assumed at p < 0.05. Because the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β is an important downstream mediator of the vascular response to LPS, we studied the effect of IL-1β on HMG-I(Y) gene expression in vitro. Cultured RASMCs were exposed to various concentrations of the cytokine for 24 h, and then total cellular RNA was extracted for Northern blot analysis. IL-1β increased HMG-I(Y) mRNA expression in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.1 A), with a maximal effect at 10 ng/ml. We then studied the time course of the effect of IL-1β at 10 ng/ml. In comparison with vehicle-treated RASMCs, IL-1β-treated RASMCs showed an initial increase in HMG-I(Y) mRNA after 6 h (Fig. 1 B). Peak induction of HMG-I(Y) message (6.2-fold) occurred after 48 h of IL-1β stimulation, even though HMG-I(Y) mRNA levels remained significantly elevated after 72 h of IL-1β treatment. Pretreating the cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide completely abolished induction of HMG-I(Y) mRNA after IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 1 C), indicating that this induction depended on protein synthesis de novo. To determine whether LPS could also have an effect on HMG-I(Y) in cultured smooth muscle cells, we applied LPS directly to RASMCs. LPS produced an increase in HMG-I(Y) message (data not shown), although less dramatically than IL-1β. Previous studies have also shown that the induction of iNOS in vascular smooth muscle cells is more pronounced after stimulation with proinflammatory ctyokines than with LPS (47Sirsjo A. Soderkvist P. Sundqvist T. Carlsson M. Ost M. Gidlof A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 48Beasley D. Eldridge M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: R1197-R1203PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism responsible for this increase in HMG-I(Y) mRNA levels in RASMCs after IL-1β stimulation, we measured the half-life of HMG-I(Y) mRNA in the absence or presence of IL-1β. Total cellular RNA was extracted at 0, 4, 8, 10, 12, and 24 h after stimulation with vehicle or IL-1β, and the HMG-I(Y) mRNA half-life was calculated. The half-life of the message was approximately 12 h (Fig.2 A), and IL-1β did not increase HMG-I(Y) mRNA stability. Thus, the increase in HMG-I(Y) mRNA in response to IL-1β treatment could not be explained by a change in mRNA stability after cytokine stimulation. We then performed transient transfection experiments with HMG-I(Y) promoter construct Δ180 (containing the second transcription start site) (36Ogram S.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14235-14342Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IL-1β increased HMG-I(Y) promoter activity in RASMCs after 24 h of stimulation (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the induction of HMG-I(Y) mRNA by IL-1β was due to an increase in gene transcription. Analysis of a larger promoter construct (base pairs –172 to +2322), containing the first three transcription start sites of HMG-I(Y), produced no further increase in reporter activity compared with plasmid Δ180 (data not shown). A promoter construct containing more of the downstream sequence (base pairs +3771 to +4928), including the fourth transcription start site of HMG-I(Y), was not responsive to IL-1β stimulation (data not shown). To see whether the increase in HMG-I(Y) mRNA levels, which peaked 48 h after IL-1β treatment (Fig. 1 A), corresponded to an increase in HMG-I(Y) protein levels, we treated cultured RASMCs with vehicle or IL-1β for 48 h. Proteins soluble in 5% HClO4 were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody to HMG-I(Y). IL-1β induced an increase in HMG-I(Y) protein levels of 11.1-fold, as assessed by densitometry after normalization against the levels of histone H1 (Fig. 3). We intraperitoneally injected male Sprague-Dawley rats (220–250 g) with vehicle or bacterial LPS. Nine hours after treatment, the rats were killed, and abdominal aortas were collected for immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-HMG-I(Y) an"

To explore the requirement of Syk catalytic activity for tubulin phosphorylation, tubulin was isolated from cytosolic fractions from anti-IgM-activated B-cells (DT40) that lacked endogenous Syk and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Tubulin was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in Syk− B-cells. Phosphorylation could be restored by the expression of wild-type, but not catalytically inactive, Syk. However, both catalytically inactive and wild-type Syk were capable of constitutive association with tubulin, indicating that tubulin phosphorylation is not required for this interaction. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody immunoblotting of proteins adsorbed to colchicine-agarose revealed the presence of three major tubulin-associated phosphoproteins of 110, 90, and 74 kDa, the phosphorylation of which was dependent on Syk expression. The proteins of 110 and 90 kDa were identified as Cbl and Vav, two proto-oncogene products known to become prominently phosphorylated following receptor engagement. Both proteins were shown to be constitutively associated with tubulin. Aggregation of the B-cell antigen receptor leads to the activation of the 72-kDa Syk protein-tyrosine kinase and the phosphorylation of tubulin on tyrosine.

Both proteins were shown to be constitutively associated with tubulin. Aggregation of the B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) 1The abbreviations used are: BCR, B-cell antigen receptor; SH2, Src homology 2; ITAM, immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; WT, wild-type. complex leads to a host of intracellular events culminating in cellular proliferation and antibody production in mature B-cells. The earliest events to occur after aggregation are the rapid induction of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation and the subsequent production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, release of calcium from intracellular stores, and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (1DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The BCR, which is composed of a membrane-bound surface immunoglobulin and associated Igα and Igβ chains, lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (2Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transduction of signals is accomplished by activation of intracellular protein-tyrosine kinases, including members of the Src family (Blk, Fyn, Lck, and Lyn) (3Yamanashi Y. Kakiuchi T. Mizuguchi J. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Science. 1991; 251: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 4Campbell M.A. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell.

Activation of Syk requires the presence of conserved amino acid sequences, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), in the cytoplasmic tails of Igα and Igβ. Each ITAM is composed of two YXX(L/I) cassettes separated by a 6–8-amino acid spacer (1DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the ITAM tyrosines, presumably by Src family kinases, provides a docking site for the tandem pair of SH2 domains found in the amino-terminal half of Syk. The recruitment of Syk to the antigen receptor activates and positions the kinase at the plasma membrane, where it can interact with and phosphorylate substrates that are important for receptor-mediated signaling. Tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated Syk is also released from the antigen receptor, which may allow interactions with additional cellular substrates (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). One potential cytosolic substrate with which Syk interacts is α-tubulin (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To further explore this interaction, we have isolated tubulin-containing cytosolic complexes from B-cells by affinity chromatography and analyzed proteins bound to them. In this report, we provide evidence that Syk associates with tubulin in a manner that is independent of tubulin phosphorylation. In addition to Syk, cytosolic tubulin is constitutively associated with at least three tyrosine kinase substrates, which include the proto-oncogene products Cbl and Vav. DT40 and Syk− DT40 chicken B-cells were obtained from Dr. Tomohiro Kurosaki. Syk− DT40 cell lines expressing Syk(WT), Syk(Y130E), and Syk(Y130F) were described previously (7Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Syk(K396R) is described below. The 9E10 anti-Myc hybridoma cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, and the ascites fluid was prepared by the Purdue University Cancer Center Antibody Production Facility. The following antibodies were also used in this report: goat anti-chicken IgM and goat anti-human IgM antibodies (Bethyl Laboratories), goat anti-mouse IgM antibodies (Cappel), anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody RC20H (Transduction Laboratories), anti-Vav antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Cbl antibody (Upstate Biotechnology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (a kind gift of Dr. David Asai, Purdue University) and polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-Syk antibodies (prepared as described previously (8Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Colchicine-agarose was prepared as described (10Schmitt H. Littauer U.Z. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 34: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Generation of a cDNA for Myc epitope-tagged Syk has been described previously (7Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To generate kinase-deficient Myc-tagged Syk (Syk(K396R)) cDNA, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the unique site elimination method described by Deng and Nickoloff (11Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Syk− DT40 cells were electroporated with 25 μg of Syk(K396R) cloned into theXhoI site of the pGEM/EPB expression vector (12Dildrop R. Ma A. Zimmerman K. Hsu E. Tesfaye A. DePinho R. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1121-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), along with 2.5 μg p3′SS (Stratagene), which contains the hygromycin resistance gene. Cells were selected in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mg/ml hygromycin and screened for Syk expression by immunoblotting. The absence of Syk(K396R) catalytic activity was confirmed by an in vitro kinase assay (data not shown). Cytosolic fractions from chicken DT40 and murine Bal17 B-cells (5–10 × 106cells/sample) were obtained as described previously (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated on ice in the presence or absence of affinity purified anti-IgM antibodies (25–50 μg/ml) for 10 min or as indicated, prior to lysis. Proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation with anti-α-tubulin or anti-Myc antibodies coupled to protein G plus agarose (Oncogene Science) or protein A-Sepharose, respectively. Immune complexes were washed with homogenization buffer three times. In vitro kinase assays were performed as described elsewhere (8Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore), and visualized by autoradiography following incubation of the membrane with 1 n KOH at 55 °C for 2 h to reduce the levels of phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Cytosolic fractions prepared as above were incubated with colchicine-agarose for 45 min at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times in homogenization buffer. Proteins were eluted by addition of SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Bal17 B-cells (5–10 × 106 cells/sample) were treated with 7.5 μg/ml Taxol or an equal volume of Me2SO as a vehicle control for 2.5 h at 37 °C. To explore the potential interactions of B-cell tubulin with endogenous protein-tyrosine kinases, tubulin was immunoprecipitated with an anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody from the soluble fraction of lysates prepared from unstimulated and anti-IgM-activated B-cells. The resulting immune complexes were then incubated with [γ-32P]ATP. As illustrated in Fig.1 A, tubulin was the predominant substrate present in the anti-tubulin immune complexes. Tubulin-associated phosphate was stable to treatment with 1N KOH at 55 °C for 2 h, suggesting that phosphorylation occurred predominantly on tyrosine. A small amount of tubulin can be coimmunoprecipitated with Syk in anti-Syk immune complexes prepared from the soluble fractions of anti-IgM activated B cells (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that Syk is the kinase most likely to be associated with soluble tubulin. To enhance our ability to detect tubulin-associated Syk, Syk− DT40 chicken B-cells (13Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar) were transfected with a cDNA encoding wild-type murine Syk (Syk(WT)) (7Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These cells express an elevated level of Syk protein that is readily detectable by immunoblotting with anti-Syk antibodies. Cytosolic fractions were prepared from control and anti-IgM-treated cells and adsorbed to colchicine-agarose to isolate tubulin and tubulin-associated proteins. Colchicine-binding proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Syk antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Syk(WT) could be readily detected in the bound fraction. Receptor cross-linking had no detectable effect on the amount of tubulin-associated Syk(WT). The amount of tubulin bound to the affinity resin, as determined by immunoblotting with anti-tubulin antibodies, also was not detectably altered by receptor engagement (data not shown). To determine whether Syk-catalyzed tubulin phosphorylation was required for Syk association, Syk−DT40 cells were prepared that expressed a catalytically inactive form of Syk (Syk(K396R)), in which an essential lysine in the catalytic domain was replaced by arginine. The ability of Syk(K396R) to bind tubulin was assessed by immunoblot analysis of colchicine-agarose-binding proteins prepared from the soluble fractions of the transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, Syk(K396R) still associated with tubulin. Immunoblotting of the affinity-purified tubulin with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies indicated that tubulin was not phosphorylated on tyrosine in cells expressing only a catalytically inactive form of Syk (Fig. 1 C). The lack of tubulin phosphorylation in Syk(K396R)-expressing cells suggested that Syk was required for the tubulin phosphorylation that is observed in B-cells following antigen receptor engagement (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To confirm this, the receptor-stimulated phosphorylation of tubulin was compared in wild-type DT40 cells expressing the normal level of endogenous Syk and Syk−DT40 cells. Colchicine-binding proteins isolated from the cytosolic fractions of control and anti-IgM-treated cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2, the phosphorylation of tubulin on tyrosine was completely abrogated in the absence of Syk expression. Immunoblot analysis with anti-tubulin antibodies confirmed the presence of equivalent amounts of tubulin in the samples prepared from the wild-type and Syk− cells (data not shown). Densitometric analyses of anti-tubulin and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots were used to determine the extent of phosphorylation of cytosolic tubulin by comparing tubulin isolated from cytosolic extracts to purified tubulin phosphorylated in vitro to known stoichiometries using Syk. The results demonstrated that in unstimulated cells, approximately 1.2% of cytosolic tubulin is tyrosine-phosphorylated, whereas in cells stimulated with anti-IgM antibodies, approximately 4.7% of cytosolic tubulin is tyrosine-phosphorylated. These levels of tubulin tyrosine phosphorylation are similar to those observed by Ley et al.(14Ley S.C. Verbi W. Pappin D.J. Druker B. Davies A.A. Crumpton M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in the Jurkat T cell line. Immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies of colchicine-agarose-associated proteins from wild-type DT40 B-cells revealed three phosphotyrosine-containing proteins, in addition to tubulin, the appearance of which was dependent on both receptor cross-linking and the expression of endogenous Syk (Fig. 2). The apparent molecular weights of these proteins, which also appear as a subset of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins seen in colchicine-agarose precipitations from Bal17 murine B-cells (see Fig.4 A), were 110,000, 90,000, and 74,000. These data suggested that Syk substrates other than tubulin were associating with the colchicine-agarose affinity resin. The apparent variation in recovery of phosphoproteins between DT40 and Bal17 B-cells was reproducible and may have resulted from the decreased expression of protein-tyrosine kinases, specifically of the Src family, in the DT40 cell line. In addition to expressing only one Src family kinase (Lyn) (13Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), we have observed that DT40 B-cells express lower levels of Syk compared with other B-cell lines. Several experiments were conducted to explore the specificity of the interaction of these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with colchicine-agarose. The inclusion of an excess of colchicine blocked the interaction of all of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with colchicine-agarose, indicating that their interaction with the resin was specific for the immobilized ligand (data not shown). In addition, no binding of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins to either phenyl-agarose or butyl-agarose was observed, indicating that the phosphoproteins were not bound due to nonspecific, hydrophobic interactions (data not shown). To determine whether the binding of these phosphoproteins to colchicine-agarose occurred via their specific interaction with tubulin, immunoprecipitations using a monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody were performed in parallel with adsorption to colchicine-agarose. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.3 A, both colchicine-agarose and anti-tubulin immune complexes contained a comparable set of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins. The recovery of tubulin-associated proteins is enhanced by the use of colchicine-agarose, which binds a higher fraction of the available soluble tubulin than does the monoclonal antibody. Western blotting analysis of immunoprecipitated tubulin bands in Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4, is complicated by their comigration with the heavy chain of the anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody. To further test this specificity, cells were pretreated with the microtubule-stabilizing agent Taxol to promote the polymerization of soluble tubulin. Cytosolic fractions were prepared from anti-IgM-activated control and Taxol-treated cells and adsorbed to colchicine-agarose. As shown in Fig. 3 C, Taxol pretreatment essentially removed all detectable tubulin from the cytosolic fraction. This in turn led to a dramatic decrease in the level of colchicine-agarose-associated phosphoproteins that could be recovered (Fig. 3 B). The 120-kDa proto-oncogene product Cbl becomes prominently tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to BCR aggregation and has been shown to associate with Sykin vivo (15Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T.

Scharenberg A.M. Donovan J.A. Kinet J.P. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine whether the tubulin-associated, 110-kDa phosphoprotein corresponded to Cbl, colchicine-agarose binding proteins prepared from Bal17 B-cells were probed by immunoblotting with anti-Cbl antibodies. As shown in Fig.4 (lanes 3 and 4), Cbl was constitutively present in the colchicine-agarose-bound fraction. It has been previously reported that the 95-kDa tyrosine kinase substrate Vav associates with both tubulin and ZAP-70 in Jurkat T-cells (17Huby R.D. Carlile G.W. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30241-30244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine whether the 90-kDa protein that was present in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of colchicine-agarose adsorbed proteins represented Vav, the immunoblot was reprobed using anti-Vav antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4 (lanes 5 and 6), Vav also was found associated with the colchicine-agarose-bound fraction. Again, as with Cbl, the presence of Vav is constitutive. To determine the relative stoichiometries of Cbl, Syk, and Vav associated with cytosolic tubulin, immunoblotting of total cytosolic fractions and colchicine-agarose fractions was performed, followed by densitometric analysis. The results demonstrated that approximately 25% of cytosolic Cbl, 22% of cytosolic Syk and 36% of cytosolic Vav associate with cytosolic tubulin in B-cells. Substitution of Tyr-130 with Glu produces a constitutively active form of Syk with a significantly reduced affinity for the BCR and a reduced ability to support receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple cellular substrates (7Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether Syk(Y130E) could associate with tubulin, cytosolic fractions were prepared from Syk− DT40 cell lines expressing equivalent levels of Syk(WT) or Syk(Y130E) and adsorbed to colchicine-agarose. Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-Syk antibodies (Fig.5 A) and then stripped and reprobed with anti-tubulin antibodies (Fig. 5 B). These data indicate that the mutation at Tyr-130, which strongly affects Syk-BCR interactions, has little or no effect on the Syk-tubulin interaction. The phosphorylation of colchicine-agarose-binding proteins was compared in Syk− DT40 B-cells expressing either Syk(WT) or the Syk(Y130E) mutant (Fig. 6). In Syk(WT)-expressing cells, receptor engagement stimulated the phosphorylation of the three tubulin-associated proteins. In contrast, receptor cross-linking had little effect on the phosphorylation of tubulin-associated proteins in the Syk(Y130E)-expressing cells. A small amount of tubulin can be coimmunoprecipitated with Syk in anti-Syk immune complexes prepared from the soluble fractions of anti-IgM activated B-cells (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), indicating that these proteins are able to interact with one another. In the reciprocal experiment, antibodies to tubulin coimmunoprecipitate an endogenous protein-tyrosine kinase activity that catalyzes the tyrosine phosphorylation of tubulin (Fig.1 A). Low levels of a 72-kDa phosphoprotein can be seen in the anti-tubulin phosphorylation assays, but the low levels of Syk in these immune complexes proved difficult to detect by Western blotting with the available anti-Syk antibodies. Tubulin-associated Syk, however, could be detected easily when isolated from a Syk− DT40 B cell line in which murine Syk was expressed at an elevated level (Figs. 1 B and 5 A). This association permits the in vitro phosphorylation of tubulin by Syk on a single tyrosine that lies near the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It should be noted that although tubulin is the predominant phosphoprotein seen in Fig. 1 A, longer exposures did reveal the presence of a number of other phosphoproteins, including several between 66 and 205 kDa. The absence of a robust Syk autophosphorylation is not surprising, as we have previously observed significant decreases in Syk autophosphorylation in vitro in the presence of a good substrate (18Zioncheck T.F. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15637-15643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This also is likely to explain the absence of other prominently phosphorylated proteins, because it is likely that Syk is the predominant tyrosine kinase in these immune complexes and that tubulin is the best Syk substrate present. Two additional hematopoietic cell tyrosine kinases, Fyn (19Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Eckerskorn C. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and ZAP-70 (17Huby R.D. Carlile G.W. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30241-30244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), have been reported to bind tubulin. The interaction of Fyn with tubulin is mediated by the Fyn SH2 domain and requires the prior tyrosine-phosphorylation of tubulin (19Marie-Cardine A. Kirchgessner H. Eckerskorn C. Meuer S.C. Schraven B. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 3290-3297Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, a similar mechanism of association is unlikely to mediate the Syk-tubulin interaction, because a catalytically inactive form of Syk retains its tubulin binding capacity despite its inability to catalyze tubulin phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Also, the interactions of Syk(WT) with tubulin in Syk(WT)-expressing DT40 cells (Fig. 1 B) and of ZAP-70 with tubulin in Jurkat T-cells (17Huby R.D. Carlile G.W. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30241-30244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) are independent of receptor engagement. Likewise, a mutant form of Syk (Syk(Y130E) that exhibits a much reduced affinity for the phosphorylated BCR (7Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) retains its ability to bind tubulin (Fig. 5 A). Thus, tubulin phosphorylation is not a prerequisite for Syk binding. Tubulin, however, is capable of binding to the SH2 domains of Grb2, the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase and phospholipase C-γ1 at regions distinct from the phosphotyrosine binding sites (20Itoh T. Miura K. Miki H. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Because the amino termini of Syk and ZAP-70 each contain a tandem pair of SH2 domains, an SH2 domain-mediated interaction of these kinases with tubulin in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner remains a possibility. The nature of the Syk-tubulin interaction is also reflected in the manner in which tubulin becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine. Previous studies implicated Syk in the in vivo phosphorylation of tubulin, because the pretreatment of B-cells with the Syk-selective inhibitor piceatannol abrogated the receptor-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of tubulin (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We have now extended these findings, using both Syk− DT40 cells and Syk− cells stably expressing a catalytically inactive form of Syk, to show that Syk catalytic activity is indeed required for tubulin phosphorylation (Figs. 1 C and 2). Thus, the phosphorylation state of tubulin on tyrosine in B-cells is an indicator of the presence of tubulin-associated, active Syk kinase. In cells expressing normal levels of endogenous Syk, there is little or no tubulin phosphorylation in the absence of receptor cross-linking (Fig. 2). In cells overexpressing Syk(WT), the basal level of tubulin phosphorylation is somewhat elevated, and this increases with receptor cross-linking (Fig.1 C). In cells overexpressing Syk(Y130E), a form of Syk that is constitutively active and fails to bind to the antigen receptor (7Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), tubulin is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine and this phosphorylation is not enhanced further by receptor cross-linking (Fig.6). We observed at least three protein substrates that become phosphorylated on tyrosine following receptor engagement and that co-isolate with soluble tubulin by affinity chromatography on colchicine-agarose (Fig. 2) or by immunoprecipitation with anti-tubulin antibodies (Fig. 3 A). These include Cbl, Vav (Fig. 4), and one additional protein of 74,000 Da that remains to be identified. Both Cbl and Vav are known to be phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases activated downstream of immune recognition receptors (15Panchamoorthy G. Fukazawa T. Miyake S. Soltoff S. Reedquist K. Druker B.

Immunol. 1994; 152: 2123-2129PubMed Google Scholar). The tyrosine phosphorylation of tubulin is distinguished from the phosphorylation of other proteins, such as Cbl and Vav, which require Syk to be activated by receptor cross-linking. Unlike tubulin, these tubulin-associated proteins are not constitutively phosphorylated in cells expressing Syk(Y130E) (Fig. 6), and this is true in general for the bulk of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins seen in whole cell lysates (7Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10377-10381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). If Syk is directly responsible for the phosphorylation of Cbl and Vav, then this difference might be accounted for by differences in the mechanisms by which Syk interacts with its various substrates. Because the recovery of these proteins by affinity chromatography was blocked by free colchicine and required the presence of soluble tubulin dimers in the lysate (Fig. 3 B), it appears that some substrates for receptor-activated protein-tyrosine kinases share with Syk the ability to interact with tubulin or tubulin-associated proteins. The clustering of Syk family kinases at the site of aggregated antigen receptors promotes the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues that serve as putative docking sites for SH2 domain- or phosphotyrosine-binding domain-containing proteins. For example, ZAP-70 bound to proteins containing multiple ITAMs autophosphorylates on sites that interact with Fyn, Lck, GAP and Abl (27Neumeister E.N. Zhu Y. Richard S. Terhorst C. Chan A.C. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3171-3178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both Cbl and Vav possess multiple domains that can participate in protein-protein interactions as well. In addition to several proline-rich, SH3-binding motifs and multiple tyrosine phosphorylation sites, Cbl has a novel phosphotyrosine binding domain that interacts with Syk and ZAP-70 in an activation-dependent manner (28Lupher M.L. Reedquist K.A. Miyake S. Langdon W.Y. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24063-24068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Vav, a potential guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Ras-related GTP-binding protein, Rac-1 (29Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), contains a guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain (similar to the exchange factor Dbl), a pleckstrin homology domain, a number of phosphorylatable tyrosine residues, and an SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. Vav interacts with activated, phosphorylated Syk and ZAP-70 in B- and T-cells via its SH2 domain (30Deckert M. Tartare-Deckert S. Couture C. Mustelin T. Altman A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 591-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 31Katzav S. Sutherland M. Packham G. Yi T. Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32579-32585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the interactions of Cbl and Vav with active Syk may require the proper phosphorylation of Syk to occur at the site of aggregated antigen receptors, whereas the interaction of tubulin with Syk occurs independently of the phosphorylation of either the enzyme or the substrate. Although no description prior to this report has been made of an association between Cbl and tubulin, an interaction of Vav with tubulin has been described previously in T-cells (17Huby R.D. Carlile G.W. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30241-30244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In T-cells, both ZAP-70 and Vav bind tubulin independently, as well as binding to one another (17Huby R.D. Carlile G.W. Ley S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30241-30244Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in RBL-2H3 cells, cross-linking studies have revealed that a fraction of Vav exists in soluble lysates in large complexes of up to 300 kDa that also contain Syk, Grb2, Raf-1, Mek-1, and Erk-2 (32Song J.S. Gomez J. Stancato L.F. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26962-26970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). It was not determined whether these complexes also contained tubulin, but several of the components of this complex (i.e. Vav, Syk, Grb2, and Erk-2) have been previously reported to interact with tubulin (6Peters J.D. Furlong M.T. Asai D.J. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4755-4762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 17Huby R.D. Carlile G.W. Ley S.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1993; 158: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Also in RBL-2H3 mast cells, Cbl associates constitutively with Syk, and upon engagement of FcεRI receptors it becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine (16Ota Y. Beitz L.O. Scharenberg A.M. Donovan J.A. Kinet J.P. Samelson L.E. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Like the Vav-ZAP-70 interaction, it is possible that Syk and Cbl may also interact both directly and indirectly through the mutual binding of tubulin. The physiological relevance of the association of Syk, Vav, and Cbl with tubulin is as yet uncertain. Tubulin can form protein-protein interactions with a wide variety of potential participants of hematopoietic cell signal transduction pathways ranging from receptors (e.g. the Ig-α and Ig-β components of the BCR in B-cells (34Vasile S. Coligan J.E. Yoshida M. Seon B.K. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and CD2 in T-cells (35Offringa R. Bierer B.E. J. Biol.

The frequent reports of tubulin-associated signaling molecules suggests that tubulin or microtubules might function in part to promote the formation of signaling complexes or perhaps aid in the intracellular localization of these signaling molecules."

One of the prerequisites to promote the transition from unicellularity to multicellularity during evolution was the development of a complex extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; pNPP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; kb, kilobase pairs; bp, base pairs. from a simple cell wall. The ECM of a multicellular organism is a complex organelle that serves structural and enzymatic functions (reviewed in Ref. 1Showalter A.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). It mediates many developmental responses including regulation of growth and differentiation, wound repair, and pathogen defense. The ECM also plays a key role when adaptations to environmental changes are required. The evolutionary transition from unicellularity to multicellularity can be analyzed among the volvocaceae, a family of photoautotrophic green algae. The complexity within this family progresses gradually from unicellular Chlamydomonas via Gonium andPandorina to Eudorina, forming colonies with an increasing cooperation of individual cells. The most advanced member of the volvocaceae, Volvox, has developed a multicellular form of organization with a complete division of labor between two cell types, somatic and reproductive. In Volvox carteri, about 2000 cells are somatic and only 16 cells are reproductive (2Starr R.C. Arch. Protistenk. 1969; 111: 204-222Google Scholar, 3Starr R.C. Dev. Biol. 1970; 4 (suppl.): 59-100Google Scholar). The ECM of Volvox exhibits anatomically distinct structures; based on light and electron microscopic observations theVolvox ECM was divided into four main zones and several subzones (reviewed in Ref. 4Kirk D.L. Birchem R. King N. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 80: 207-231PubMed Google Scholar). The Volvox ECM lacks cellulose, pectins, or lignin but mainly consists of glycoproteins, and the structures of several ECM glycoproteins are known in molecular detail (reviewed in Ref. 5Sumper M. Hallmann A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 180: 51-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cell walls of higher plants several enzymes such as peroxidases, invertases, mannosidases, glucanases, arabinosidases, galactosidases, polygalacturonase, pectin methylesterases, malate dehydrogenase, proteases, and phosphatases have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 1Showalter A.M. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). However, research on these individual proteins has occurred in different plant species and all sorts of plant organs and cell types. Since higher plant ECMs are extremely complex amalgams, relatively little is known about the precise functions and intermolecular interactions. In these complex systems, it is also difficult to investigate in vivo enzymatic reactions to environmental changes. Therefore, a simple model organism as Volvox might be advantageous for ECM studies. So far, the only ECM glycoproteins ofVolvox with proven enzymatic activity are a lysozyme/chitinase (6Amon P. Haas E. Sumper M. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and an arylsulfatase (7Hallmann A. Sumper M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). I am interested in adaptations within the Volvox ECM in response to environmental stimuli. Since phosphorus is an important nutrient and often limiting in many ecosystems, the role of the ECM during phosphorus deprivation was investigated. In this report an atypical calcium-dependent extracellular phosphatase was identified in Volvox, which is synthesized in response to phosphate deprivation. The enzyme has been isolated and characterized. Likewise, the cloning and characterization of its gene is described. The female V. carteri f.nagariensis strains “HK10” (wild type), “dissociator,” and “153-48” were obtained from R. C. Starr (Culture Collection of Algae, University of Texas, Austin, TX) or from D. L. Kirk (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Synchronous cultures were grown in Volvox medium (8Provasoli L. Pintner I.J. Tyron C.A. Hartman R.T. The Ecology of Algae. Special Publication No. 2, Pymatuning Laboratory of Field Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh1959: 84-96Google Scholar) at 28 °C in an 8-h dark/16-h light (10,000 lux) cycle (9Starr R.C. Jaenicke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1050-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Strain 153-48 was grown in the presence of 1 mm NH4Cl. Standard Volvox medium contains 0.16 mmglycerophosphate. Due to an orthophosphate (Pi) contamination in the glycerophosphate (Sigma) used, standardVolvox medium also contains ∼25 μmorthophosphate. In (glycero)phosphate-free Volvox medium also no orthophosphate was detectable. Routinely, phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as a substrate. The assay contained 40 mm pNPP, 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, and enzyme in a final volume of 1 ml. When the metalloenzyme nature of the phosphatase was discovered, the assay was supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 4 m NaOH. Enzyme activity was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm. Volvox spheroids (HK10) from three 20-liter cultures were collected on a 100-μm mesh nylon screen. After extensive washing with Volvox medium lacking phosphate, the algae were incubated in phosphate-free medium under standard conditions for further 24 h. The Volvoxalgae were collected as described and disrupted ultrasonically (Sonifier B15; Branson, Danbury, CT), and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (24,000 × g, 20 min). The crude enzyme solution was fractionated and precipitated with ammonium sulfate (30–80% saturation; centrifugation at 24,000 × g, 20 min). The precipitated protein was dissolved, desalted by dialysis (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 15 h, and passed through a Sep-Pak Plus C18 reversed phase cartridge (Waters, Milford, MA). The flow-through was loaded on a QAE-Sephadex A-25 anion exchange column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and the column was developed by applying a NaCl gradient (up to 1 m) in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, at 1 ml/min. Fractions containing enzyme activity were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described. The dissolved protein was further fractionated by molecular-sieve chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 preparative grade fast protein liquid chromatography column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 200 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing the enzyme solution were concentrated using a Centriplus-30 concentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). After a short ultracentrifugation step (60,000 × g, 10 min) phosphatase was still in solution, but after a long run (90,000 ×g, 18 h) the soluble phosphatase was sedimented. Both centrifugation steps were repeated twice. Finally the enzyme pellet was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. 50 μg of phosphatase were applied to a SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (6%). The gel was stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue, 45% methanol, 19% acetic acid, and destained with 30% methanol, 7% acetic acid. The gel slice containing the extracellular phosphatase was excised, cut into small pieces, and crushed. The gel pieces were treated as follows: 2 times for 1 h 30% methanol, 7% acetic acid; 3 times for 1 h 50% methanol, 10% acetic acid; 2 times for 1 h 90% ethanol. Then the gel pieces were dried in vacuo, subsequently soaked in 4% trypsin, 0.2 m NH4HCO3 and incubated at 37 °C for 14 h. The suspension was centrifuged, and the supernatant was kept. After three subsequent washing steps (2 times 0.2 m NH4HCO3; 1 time 0.2m NH4HCO3, 50% acetonitrile), the supernatant and the wash eluates were pooled, filtered (0.22-μm Millex-GV4 filter; Millipore Waters, Bedford, MA), brought to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and dried by lyophilization. The peptides were dissolved in 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1% CF3CO2H and fractionated by reversed phase HPLC (SMART system; Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) on a μRPC C2/C18 (3 μm) column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Peptides were eluted by a 30-min linear gradient from 5 to 40% acetonitrile in 0.1% CF3CO2H with a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Peptides were rechromatographed on a μRPC C18 (3 μm) column (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) under the same conditions. Peptides were sequenced by Edman degradation using an automated gas phase peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). RNA was extracted from phosphate-starved (5 h) Volvox as described (10Kirk M.M. Kirk D.L. Cell. 1985; 41: 419-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was as described previously (11Hallmann A. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11562-11566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Hallmann A. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) using the antisense primer 5′-TCRTANGTRAAYTG (amino acid positions 13–17 of peptide 6), the sense primer 5′-GARGAYATHGGNGG (amino acid positions 3–7 of peptide 6), and an Expand High Fidelity polymerase mix (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Forty cycles of PCR amplification (94 °C, 10 s; 40 °C, 15 s; 72 °C, 5 s) were performed on a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer). The resulting 44-bp DNA fragment was ligated into the SmaI site of pUC18 vector and sequenced. The V. carteri genomic library (13Ertl H. Mengele R. Wenzl S. Engel J. Sumper M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3493-3501Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) in λEMBL 3 (14Frischauf A.-M. Lehrach H. Poustka A. Murray N. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 827-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar) was used to clone the phosphatase gene, named phoX. The screening and cloning procedures followed standard techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed by the chain termination method (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) using T7 DNA polymerase (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Synthetic oligonucleotides were used throughout to sequence the phoX gene. RNA from phosphate-starved (5 h) Volvox was used to construct a cDNA library covalently linked to magnetic beads according to the instructions of the manufacturer of the beads (Deutsche Dynal, Hamburg, Germany). The cDNA fragments of phosphatase were amplified by PCR, using this library. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR technique was performed as described (17Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar). PCR fragments were ligated into the SmaI site of pUC18 or pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Synthetic oligonucleotides were used to sequence the phosphatase cDNA fragments in both directions. To achieve high and constitutive phosphatase production, the phosphatase phoX gene was placed under the control of the Volvox β-tubulin promoter (18Harper J.F. Mages W. Gen. Genet. 1988; 213: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For construction of the chimeric gene, genomic clones of Volvoxβ-tubulin (nucleotides 40–501 of tubulin sequence as deposited in the GenBankTM data base, accession number L24547) and phosphatase were used. An additional EcoRV site was generated by PCR directly upstream of the start codons both of thephoX gene and the Volvox β-tubulin gene as described (19Hallmann A. Rappel A. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7469-7474Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), to facilitate ligation of the parent DNAs. To introduce a short marker peptide (DYKDDDDK, FLAG epitope tag) at the C terminus of the phosphatase, the gene splicing by overlap extension, or recombinant PCR technique, was performed as described (20Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar). The first PCR was performed on a genomic phosphatase plasmid with a 19-mer 5′ sense primer (5′-CTGTTAACCTCTTGCTGAT) and a 44-mer 3′ antisense primer (5′-CTA CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCATCCCAGGACGATACGC) with only half of the primer matching; the other half carries the sequence coding for the epitope tag (tag sequence in bold and stop codon in italics). The second PCR was performed on the same template with a 42-mer 5′ sense primer (5′-GACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG TAGATGCGCGCACGTGAC, in which the underlined nucleotides are complementary to the corresponding region of the antisense primer of the first PCR), and a 20-mer 3′ antisense primer (5′-AGTGATGCAATGATCTTACA). The third PCR was carried out with both of these PCR products and only the flanking primers. PCRs were performed as described (11Hallmann A. Sumper M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11562-11566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). All fragments were joined together by standard techniques (15Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The complete construct was confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing. All transformation experiments were performed with the Volvox nitrate reductase gene as a selectable marker on a separate plasmid (21Schiedlmeier B. Schmitt R. Müller W. Kirk M.M. Gruber H. Mages W. Kirk D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5080-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs for transformation of Volvox were purified using anion exchange columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Gold microprojectiles (1 μm in diameter; Bio-Rad) were coated with the required targeting plasmids, and stable transformation of Volvox strain 153-48 was performed as described (21Schiedlmeier B. Schmitt R. Müller W. Kirk M.M. Gruber H. Mages W. Kirk D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5080-5084Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), but using a Biolistic PDS-1000/helium particle gun (Bio-Rad). Strain 153-48 carries a stable loss-of-function mutation within the nitrate reductase gene (nitA) (22Gruber H. Goetinck S.D. Kirk D.L. Schmitt R. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 120: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Out of 30 NitA-positive transformants, two transgenic Volvoxclones were recovered which expressed the phoX gene constitutively. The peptide AIYFPNIPPAVTEEEKC was synthesized on a SP4000 peptide synthesizer (Labortec, Bubendorf, Switzerland) by using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl) amino acid derivatives. The peptide corresponds to the N terminus of the mature phosphatase with an artificial cysteine at the C-terminal end. The predicted molecular mass and the sequence of the peptide were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry using a Single-Stage Quadrupole 7000 mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA) and by Edman degradation using an automated gas phase peptide sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The peptide was covalently linked to a maleimide-activated carrier protein (keyhole limpet hemocyanin; Pierce) via the SH group of the artificial cysteine. A New Zealand rabbit was immunized (intradermally) with 100 μg of phosphatase peptide coupled to 100 μg of carrier protein in 250 μl of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma). The rabbit was boostered three times at the 20th day (subcutaneously), 30th day (intradermally), and 40th day (subcutaneously) from the first immunization on with 100 μg of phosphatase peptide coupled to 100 μg of carrier protein in 250 μl of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Sigma). At the 61st day 20 ml of blood were withdrawn from the rabbit's ear vein. After blood clotting had taken place, the blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 2,000 ×g and the supernatant was kept. 0.02% sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate were added to the supernatant and stored at 4 °C. About 4000 Volvoxspheroids of wild-type or transformed algae were harvested by filtration on a 100-μm mesh nylon screen and disrupted ultrasonically. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 3 min) and used for Western blot analysis. Deep zone extracts were as described previously (23Godl K. Hallmann A. Wenzl S. Sumper M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on a 5% standard SDS-polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (0.45 μm; Millipore Waters, Bedford, MA), and probed using the polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphatase peptide antibody or a mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.). Signals were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden). Different possible substrates (p-nitrophenyl phosphate, glycerophosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, ribose 5-phosphate, phosphorylcholine,O-phospho-l-tyrosine, AMP, cAMP, NADPH, NADH, 1,2-diacyl-glycero-3-phosphate, l-α-phosphatidylcholine) were assayed by the Pi release during incubation in the presence of the phosphatase (15 min at 37 °C). For that purpose 100 μl of enzyme/substrate solution containing liberated phosphate were mixed with 1 ml of a solution containing 3 mm ammonium molybdate, 80 mm ascorbic acid, and 0.7 msulfuric acid (24Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5835) Google Scholar), and the solution was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Negative controls were performed without the enzyme. The absorbance at 820 nm was measured, and the liberated phosphate was determined diagrammatically by comparison with a standard curve of phosphate. Pi concentrations of the growth medium were determined in the same way. Radioactive labeling of ECM extracts, SSG 185, or pherophorin-S with [33P]phosphate was performed in vivo as described before (23Godl K. Hallmann A. Wenzl S. Sumper M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The different ECM glycoproteins were assayed for remaining [33P]phosphate by comparing the incorporated radioactivity prior to and after incubation with the phosphatase on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by fluorography. Phosphorus is an important and often limiting nutrient (25Schlesinger W.H. Biogeochemistry, an Analysis of Global Change. Academic Press, San Diego1991Google Scholar). Analyzing the kinetics of the Pi decrease in the medium during growth of Volvox, I observed contrary to my expectations an increasing orthophosphate concentration. WhenVolvox colonies were grown for 6 days (or 3 generations) in standard Volvox medium, the orthophosphate concentration increased from ∼25 to ∼100 μm, whereas the number of colonies rose by 2 orders of magnitude (up to six colonies/ml). Glycerophosphate supplied with the growth medium is the only possible source for orthophosphate production, indicating the action of a potent (extracellular) phosphatase. Thus, the growth medium and different extracts from Volvox spheroids were assayed for this activity using pNPP as a chromogenic substrate. A high level of phosphatase activity was identified in phosphate-deprivedVolvox, independent of the developmental stage used. This activity correlates with the appearance of a ∼160-kDa protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig.1 A). The 160-kDa protein band is not detectable in Volvox grown in the presence of 1 mm orthophosphate. Phosphate-starved wild-type algae secrete about 50% of the activity into the growth medium, and about 5% are in the deep zone of the Volvox ECM (for nomenclature see Ref. 4Kirk D.L. Birchem R. King N. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 80: 207-231PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining ∼45% of activity are bound within the cellular zone of the ECM. In a mutant Volvox strain called “dissociator” (26Dauwalder M. Whaley W.G. Starr R.C. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 70: 318-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is unable to produce a structurally intact ECM and consequently dissociates into single cells shortly after the end of embryogenesis, about 90% of phosphatase activity and most of the ∼160-kDa protein are secreted into the growth medium. These results suggested the existence of an extracellular 160-kDa phosphatase in Volvox, which is inducible by phosphate deprivation. In my experiments, purification of phosphatase from large volumes of growth medium caused problems. Therefore, the phosphatase bound within the cellular zone of the ECM served as the starting material. Volvox spheroids were cultivated in phosphate-free medium for 24 h and then harvested. The Volvox algae were disrupted ultrasonically, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation. The crude extract was fractionated and precipitated with ammonium sulfate (30–80% saturation), desalted by dialysis, and passed through a reversed phase C18 cartridge that did not adsorb the enzyme. The flow-through was loaded on an anion exchange column (QAE-Sephadex), and the column was developed with a NaCl gradient. Fractions containing enzyme activity were concentrated and then further fractionated by molecular sieve chromatography (Superdex 200). Due to self-aggregation, the soluble extracellular phosphatase could be sedimented by ultracentrifugation. This final centrifugation step was repeated twice, leading to a homogenous phosphatase preparation (Fig.1 B). Automated Edman degradation of the purified Volvox phosphatase showed that its N-terminal amino acid sequence is AIYFPNI. In order to get additional sequence information from internal peptides, Volvox phosphatase, localized in a SDS-polyacrylamide gel by Coomassie stain, was digested by incubating the corresponding gel slice with trypsin. The resulting peptide mixture was eluted from the polyacrylamide gel and chromatographed by reversed phase C2/C18 HPLC. All peaks were rechromatographed by C18 HPLC. Samples of well separated peaks were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis on an automated gas-phase sequencer. The amino acid sequence data obtained are summarized in Table I. Peptide 10 includes a N-glycosylation motif, and amino acid 10 of this peptide gave no signal in automated Edman degradation, which indicatesN-glycosylation at this site.Table IAmino acid sequences of tryptic peptides derived from extracellular phosphatase of VolvoxPeptideAmino acid sequence1YGFVTEVSYD...2TVYITDDGSN...3IYTSITDVR4IASPDNVAYVPGLD...5SELAALF6XVEDIGGXPTAAQFTYDG...7XAAYLGAXT...8AALSTAPGG...9XITLXXNVAAR10LYDLYYGEM–LTEFK11FVADRPGDLTAGNLYAAK12VSVEAALVMPDKX, amino acid not identified. Open table in a new tab X, amino acid not identified. The amino acid sequence of the tryptic peptide 6 (Table I) was used to synthesize degenerated oligonucleotide primers. The sense primer 5′-GARGAYATHGGNGG was designed from amino acid positions 3–7. The antisense primer 5′-TCRTANGTRAAYTG was designed from amino acid positions 13–17 of the same peptide. The latter primer was used to reverse transcribe total RNA of phosphate-starved V. carteri. The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using both the sense and antisense primers. Forty cycles of amplification yielded a cDNA fragment of 44 bp in length, which was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence matched the sequence of peptide 6, with glycine at position 8. A genomic library of V. carteri constructed in the replacement vector λEMBL 3 was screened using the 44-bp cDNA fragment as a probe. Eighty-five positive clones were identified out of ∼60,000 phages screened. The ∼16-kb insert of one of these phage clones was subcloned and sequenced (λphoX-1 in Fig.2 A). It was noticed that the ∼16-kb insert did not contain the 3′-terminal end of the phosphatase gene. Therefore, a genomic probe, derived from the outermost 3′-end of the sequenced phage insert, was used for an additional screening of the λEMBL 3 library. This produced ∼90 positive clones, and 5 were characterized. One of these phage clones contained the missing 3′-terminal end of the phosphatase gene and, therefore, was subcloned and sequenced (λphoX-2 in Fig. 2 A). The partially overlapping inserts of the phages λphoX-1 and -2 allowed the determination of the complete sequence of the V. carteri phosphatase gene, named phoX, including the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (Fig. 2 A). The complete 5.1-kb cDNA-sequence of the Volvoxphosphatase was obtained by RT-PCR and RACE-PCR (17Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4337) Google Scholar) technology. The 3′-RACE-PCRs revealed two different ends of the extracellular phosphatase mRNA, one 45 bp longer than the other. The applied strategy to collect the complete nucleotide sequence of the phosphatase cDNA is summarized schematically in Fig. 2 B. The sequence was submitted to the GenBankTM EBI data bank with accession number AJ012458. The exon-intron organization of the phoX gene was deduced by comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences. Fig. 2 Asummarizes the relative locations of the 33 exons and 32 introns within ∼15 kb of phosphatase sequence. The smallest exon encodes for only 11 amino acids. 73% of the genomic DNA sequence between start and stop codon is derived from introns. The deduced amino acid sequence of the Volvox phosphatase is shown in Fig.3. The PSORT protein localization program (27Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) predicts a cleavable hydrophobic leader sequence (amino acids 1–23) which is in accordance with the sequenced N terminus of the mature phosphatase. A total of eight possibleN-glycosylation sites (NXT and NXS) were found. As mentioned above, glycosylation of one of those sites has been confirmed by protein chemistry (peptide 10, Table I). Based on the cDNA data the molecular mass of the mature phosphatase protein should be 144 kDa, but SDS-gel analysis revealed a somewhat higher molecular mass (∼160 kDa). The difference may result from post-translational modification, e.g. glycosylation. There is an internal sequence similarity within the phosphatase sequence. Amino acids 30–596 show 46% identity to amino acids 610–1185, indicating a modular composition of phosphatase; there are two quite similar large domains, I and II, each about 570 amino acids in length, and a small C-terminal domain III, which is about 180 amino acids in length (Fig. 3). Comparison of the Volvox phosphatase sequence with other phosphatases or all the sequences of the Swiss-Prot protein sequence data base (BLASTP search; Ref. 28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) did not reveal any significant sequence similarities.

We wished to test whether HOX family members were also involved in a differentiation-like process occurring in normal, diploid adult cells, that is, cytokine-induced activation of endothelial cells (EC). Screening of a human EC cDNA library yielded several members of the A and B groups of HOX transcription factors. One clone represented a novel, alternatively spliced variant of the human HOXA9gene containing a new exon and the expression of which was driven by a novel promoter. This variant termed HOXA9EC appeared restricted to cells of endothelial lineage, i.e. expressed by human EC from multiple sources, but not by fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, or several transformed cell lines. HOXA9ECmRNA was rapidly down-regulated in EC in response to tumor necrosis factor-α due to an apparent reduction in transcriptional rate. Reporter construct studies showed that the 400 base pairs of genomic DNA directly 5′ to the transcription initiation site ofHOXA9EC contained the information required for both up-regulation in response to cotransfection with a HOXA9ECexpression vector and tumor necrosis factor-α-dependent down-regulation of this gene.

The pursuit of HOX genes of consequence in vascular cell differentiation and proliferation is a new field. Investigators have begun to identify HOX genes that may play a regulatory role in the adult cardiovascular system (31Gorski D.H. Patel C.V. Walsh K. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Lyons G.E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 454-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Robbins J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1996; 31: 2-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, these studies have focused on the smooth muscle cell with few published reports discussing HOX gene expression in EC (34Newman C.S. Chia F. Krieg P.A. Mech. Dev. 1997; 66: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 35Boudreau N. Andrews C. Srebrow A. Ravanpay A. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The endothelium plays a dynamic role at sites of inflammation and during cell-mediated immune responses. Quiescent EC when activated in response to treatment with cytokines, such as TNF-α or interleukin-1β, exhibit morphological changes and synthesize new proteins not present in resting endothelium (1DiCorleto P.E. Gimbrone M.A.J. Fuster V. Ross R. Topol E.J. Atherosclerosis and Coronary Artery Disease. 22. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 387-399Google Scholar). The signaling pathways leading to the expression of specific genes involved in the promotion or suppression of EC activation have not yet been defined. Promoter analysis of many EC genes that are induced in response to immune or inflammatory reactions show that ubiquitous transcription factors, such as NF-κB, ATF-2/c-Jun, and HMG-I(Y), are necessary, but not sufficient, to account for EC-specific gene expression (36Collins T.

There is increasing evidence that homeodomain proteins provide control of tissue-specific gene expression by heterodimerizing with other transcription factors (42Mak A. Johnson A.D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). As a first step toward determining the possible involvement of HOX gene expression in the biology of EC activation, we have isolated several HOX genes expressed by human EC. Here we report on the characterization of an EC-expressed, novel variant of HOXA9, which is transcribed from a novel promoter that shows both autoregulation as well as modulation during EC activation. A human umbilical vein EC cDNA library in λgtll (a gift from Vishva M. Dixit, Genentech, San Francisco) was screened using a 128-fold degenerate oligonucleotide probe directed toward the highly conserved third helix of the homeodomain and containing two inosine residues. The probe had the following sequence: (where I indicates inosine) 5′-C(G/T)IC(G/T)(A/G)TT(C/T)TG(A/G)AACCAIA(C/T)(C/T)TT-3′ (48Patel C.V. Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Lincecum J. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26085-26090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We screened 500,000 plaque-forming units and purified 80 cDNA clones. Direct sequencing (Fmol Sequencing, Promega) of the cDNA inserts in the phage was performed using 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide primers specific to the right and left arm of the phage adjacent to the 5′ and 3′ boundary of the cDNA insert. To confirm the presence of a conserved homeodomain, sequencing was performed with the oligonucleotide primer used to screen the library as well as its reverse complement. Identity of the cloned cDNAs was established by homology searches performed against the GeneBankTMnucleotide data base using the Blast algorithm. The HOXA9 genomic clones were obtained by screening a human placental genomic DNA library in Lambda EMBL3 (CLONTECH) using a uniformly32P-labeled HOXA9EC cDNA probe. The intervening region between the exons was polymerase chain reaction-amplified and sequenced using appropriate exon-specific oligonucleotide primers. Direct sequencing of the Lambda EMBL3 clone containing the HOXA9 genomic DNA confirmed the authenticity of the sequence. The sequence analysis was performed using MacVector software (Oxford Molecular Group). TheHOXA9EC cDNA insert in lambda gt11 was excised withEcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX2T, in-frame with the GST-coding sequence. Following transformation inE. coli HB101, the orientation of the insert was determined by sequencing the DNA. Production of the GST-HOXA9EC fusion protein was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (1 mm), and the cells were lysed by sonication in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). The lysate was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads for 6 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4 times with 50 volumes of lysis buffer, and protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5). Purity of the protein was determined by Coomassie staining following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The EMSA probes were synthesized by annealing the two overlapping primers and gel-purified on 12% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified from unincorporated nucleotides by a spin column method. EMSA was performed by incubating 50,000 dpm of probe with 50 ng of GST-HOXA9EC fusion protein in the presence of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 75 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol (DTT), 10 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), 5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 15% glycerol. The reaction mixture was incubated at 20 °C for 45 min and then subjected to electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) at 20 °C. The EMSA results were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Total RNA, isolated using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), was obtained from human mesenteric artery EC, human aortic smooth muscle (provided by Carol de la Motte, Cleveland Clinic Research Institute, Cleveland), skeletal muscle (provided by Dr. Linda Graham, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor), and various cultured cells. RNase protection was performed on 10 μg of RNA following the recommended protocol (Ambion). Uniformly 32P-labeled cRNA probes were generated fromHOXA9EC (EC exon (E1), 245–644; homeodomain exon, 2114–2465), human E-selectin (49Bevilacqua M.P. Stengelin S. Gimbrone M.J. Seed B. Science. 1989; 243: 1160-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar), and human γ-actin (50Enoch T. Zinn K. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A genomic DNA fragment containing the 5′-untranslated region (UTR) and upstream sequence of HOXA9EC (−416 to +85) was used to synthesize a cRNA probe to determine the 5′ boundary of theHOXA9EC-specific exon by RNase protection analysis. The size of the 5′-UTR of HOXA9EC transcript was determined by reverse transcriptase-dependent primer extension (51McKnight S.L. Kingsbury R. Science. 1982; 217: 316-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) of human umbilical vein EC poly(A)+ RNA using a32P-end-labeled antisense oligonucleotide to region 125 to −145 of the HOXA9EC sequence. The luciferase reporter constructs were made by subcloning the −416 to +86 region of theHOXA9EC genomic sequence (Fig. 2 A) in pGL3 (Promega) in both the forward and reverse orientations. Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.)-mediated transfections of cultured cells at 50% confluence were carried out with endotoxin-free DNA for 6 h, and cells were allowed to recover in serum-containing media for 2–4 h before TNF-α treatment. Reporter activity was measured in triplicate and corrected for transfection efficiency by cotransfecting with pRSV β-galactosidase DNA and measuring the β-galactosidase activity with a Galactolight Plus detection system (Tropix). For cotransfection experiments, HOXA9EC genomic DNA (−416 to +2819) was subcloned in pGEM-T (Promega) and a Hoxa-2 (48Patel C.V. Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Lincecum J. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26085-26090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen). A degenerate oligonucleotide probe targeted to the highly conserved third helix of the homeodomain (48Patel C.V. Gorski D.H. LePage D.F. Lincecum J. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26085-26090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to screen a human umbilical vein EC cDNA library. Eighty cDNA clones that hybridized to the probe were isolated and sequenced; 66 were confirmed to contain homeodomains. Identity of the clones was established by sequencing the boundaries of the cDNA inserts as well as the region within and around the homeodomain. We identified cDNAs of HOXA1, HOXA2, HOXA4, HOXA5, HOXA7, HOXA9, HOXB2, HOXB4, HOXB6, HOXB7, and an unlinked homeobox geneHLX. No members of the other two subgroups of HOX genes, C or D, were isolated among the cloned endothelial cDNAs. Two partial cDNA clones of 1.6 and 1.4 kb were found to contain the homeodomain and 3′-UTR of the HOXA9 gene as previously reported (13Borrow J. Shearman A.M. Stanton Jr., V.P. Becher R. Collins T. Williams A.J. Dube I. Katz F. Kwong Y.L. Morris C. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Rowley J. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), but their sequences differed from reported sequence upstream of the conserved splice site previously reported for both the murine Hoxa-9 cDNA (52Rubin M.R. King W. Toth L.E. Sawczuk I.S. Levine M.S. D'Eustachio P. Nguyen-Huu M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and a partial cDNA of chicken Hoxa-9 (53Gaunt S.J. Strachan L. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These clones therefore represented novel transcripts encoded by the HOXA9 gene (Fig.1 A). The sequence of the 1.6-kb cDNA, which we have termed HOXA9EC, exhibited a continuous open reading frame with a novel N-terminal 116 amino acids leading into the HOXA9 homeodomain. This sequence when scanned against the data base showed homology to the humanHOXA9 cDNAs cloned from CD34+ cells (GenBankTM accession number U82759), from the human fetus (GenBankTM accession number U41813) (13Borrow J. Shearman A.M. Stanton Jr., V.P. Becher R. Collins T. Williams A.J. Dube I. Katz F. Kwong Y.L. Morris C. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Rowley J. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and to a human PAC sequence spanning 7p-15 to p-21 (GenBankTM accession number AC004080). It was also homologous to the murine (GenBankTM accession numbers M28449, AB008914, andAB005457) (52Rubin M.R. King W. Toth L.E. Sawczuk I.S. Levine M.S. D'Eustachio P. Nguyen-Huu M.C. Mol. Cell.

Development. 1995; 121: 1731-1741PubMed Google Scholar). The novel HOXA9EC cDNA sequence, which differed from the previously described Hoxa-9 cDNAs from various species, was apparently the result of differential splicing. The internal splice acceptor site located within the novel exon had been reported by others to be used during maturation of guinea pigHox-a9A mRNA (21Rubin M.R. Nguyen-Huu M.C. DNA Seq. 1990; 1: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and in the fusion betweenHoxa-10 exon 1A and Hoxa-9 (17Benson G.V. Nguyen T.H. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This site has also been reported to serve as the breakpoint for the t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation that causes an in-frame fusion of NUP98 andHOXA9 in acute myeloid leukemia (13Borrow J. Shearman A.M. Stanton Jr., V.P. Becher R. Collins T. Williams A.J. Dube I. Katz F. Kwong Y.L. Morris C. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Rowley J. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The 1.4-kb clone HOXA9NT(non-translatable) contained multiple termination codons in all three possible reading frames upstream of the homeodomain and lacked a favorable AUG, suggesting that it did not code for a homeodomain-containing protein. Other HOX transcripts that lack homeodomain-coding open reading frames include the bovineHoxA9 cDNA, 2J. Q. You and P. E. DiCorleto, unpublished results. Xenopus Xhox36 (17Benson G.V. Nguyen T.H. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), murine Hoxa-1(56Baron A. Featherstone M.S. Hill R.E. Hall A. Galliot B. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2977-2986Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), Hoxa-10 (17Benson G.V. Nguyen T.H. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Hoxc-6 (57Sharpe P.T. Miller J.R. Evans E.P. Burtenshaw M.D. Gaunt S.J. Development. 1988; 102: 397-407PubMed Google Scholar). The protein-coding region of HOXA9EC was subcloned into the pGEX2T vector, and the resulting glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was induced in Escherichia coli and purified (Fig. 1 B). The sequence-specific DNA-binding properties of the GST-HOXA9EC were examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 1 C). GST-HOXA9EC showed preferential binding to a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the recognition site of the Abd-Bhomeodomain, as defined by Benson et al. (17Benson G.V. Nguyen T.H. Maas R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1591-1601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Competition with excess unlabeled oligonucleotide containing either a mutatedAbd-B binding sequence or the Antennapediahomeodomain recognition sequence did not alter the binding ofHOXA9EC to the Abd-B sequence. By using the partial HOXA9EC cDNA as a probe, a second round of screening of the EC cDNA library yielded fourHOXA9EC overlapping clones constituting a complete coding sequence (Fig. 2 A). TheHOXA9EC mRNA was found to encode a 30-kDa homeodomain protein containing an N-terminal polyhistidine tract, a motif found in many HOX proteins, and a centrally located proline-tyrosine pair that is conserved in HOX genes of the Abd-B class (58Izpisua B.J. Falkenstein H. Dolle P. Renucci A. Duboule D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2279-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). A human genomic DNA library in Lambda EMBL3 was screened to isolate clones containing HOXA9EC. The 5′ boundary of the novel exon was determined by RNase protection analysis of a cRNA probe generated from a 493-bp genomic DNA fragment containing the 5′-UTR and its upstream region (Fig. 2 B). Primer extension of theHOXA9EC mRNA was performed to determine the 5′-UTR (Fig.2 C) and the transcription initiation site was found to coincide with the 5′ boundary of the novel exon, suggesting that this exon and the A9 homeodomain-coding exon were sufficient to generate theHOXA9EC transcript. Direct sequencing using exon-specific, oligonucleotide primers confirmed that one of the HOXA9 genomic clones contained the exons encoding the A9 homeodomain, the novel HOXA9EC exon, and the first exon of the previously reported HOXA9 cDNA isolated from fetal tissue (13Borrow J. Shearman A.M. Stanton Jr., V.P. Becher R. Collins T. Williams A.J. Dube I. Katz F. Kwong Y.L. Morris C. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Rowley J. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The novel HOXA9EC 5′ exon was found to be separated by a 990-bp intron from the common 3′ exon containing the HOXA9 homeodomain. Polymerase chain reaction amplification using exon-specific primers, followed by sequencing, confirmed the presence of a 3.7-kb intron separating the 5′ exon of the fetal HOXA9 cDNA sequence that splices to theHOXA9 homeodomain-containing exon (13Borrow J. Shearman A.M. Stanton Jr., V.P. Becher R. Collins T. Williams A.J. Dube I. Katz F. Kwong Y.L. Morris C. Ohyashiki K. Toyama K. Rowley J. Housman D.E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) andHOXA9EC exon 1. The colocalization of the previously mapped fetal HOXA9 exon upstream of the EC exon 1 and theHOXA9 homeodomain exon in the human genomic clones confirmed that HOXA9EC cDNA was derived from the HOXA9locus (Fig. 2 D). Northern analysis of human umbilical vein EC mRNA revealed a single 2.1-kb transcript hybridizing to either the full-length HOXA9EC cDNA probe (Fig. 3 A) or theHOXA9EC exon L-specific probe (not shown) suggesting thatHOXA9 transcribes a single major transcript of low abundance in EC. This was in contrast to the expression of the murineHoxa-9 gene that was shown to encode a major transcript of 2.5 kb (52Rubin M.R. King W. Toth L.E. Sawczuk I.S. Levine M.S. D'Eustachio P. Nguyen-Huu M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The RPA using a HOXA9EC exon 1-specific probe revealed that HOXA9EC was expressed in freshly isolated EC from human mesenteric artery but not in smooth muscle cells from the same artery (Fig. 3 B). HOXA9EC expression was also examined in a variety of cultured cells by RPA using the exon 1-specific probe. HOXA9EC mRNA was detected in primary cultures of human aortic, as well as microvascular, EC, but not in fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, or a series of transformed cell lines (Fig. 3 C). A multiple tissue Northern blot probed with full-lengthHOXA9EC cDNA revealed a major 2.5-kb transcript in skeletal muscle and a weak signal for a similar transcript in kidney (Fig. 3 D). No such hybridization was detected with aHOXA9EC exon 1-specific probe (not shown) suggesting that the HOXA9EC-specific exon may not be expressed in skeletal muscle and kidney. We then confirmed by RPA that the A9 homeodomain-coding exon, but not the EC exon, was expressed in skeletal muscle (Fig. 3 E). Our failure to detect HOXA9ECmessage in vascularized tissues may be due to the low abundance of this message in EC and the fact that EC comprise only a small fraction of the cellular content of these tissues. Activation of the endothelium is a differentiation-like process, believed to be critical in the initiation of a variety of inflammatory processes in the vessel wall (59DiCorleto P.E. Am. J. Hypertens. 1993; 6: S314-S318Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 60Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Cybulsky M.I. Kume N. Collins T. Resnick N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 122-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine whether HOXA9EC expression was involved in the process of EC activation, we measured the steady state levels of HOXA9ECmRNA in resting and TNF-α-activated human umbilical vein EC. We observed a rapid and nearly complete (>8 fold) down-regulation in the steady state level of HOXA9EC mRNA in response to TNF-α treatment for 4 h (Fig.4 A). E-selectin as a marker of EC activation served to verify the efficacy of TNF-α in stimulating these cells. Similar down-regulation of HOXA9EC mRNA was observed in EC treated with either interleukin-1β or lipopolysaccharide but not phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (not shown). Pretreatment of human umbilical vein EC with cycloheximide did not block the effect of TNF-α (Fig. 4 B), indicating that ne"

However, despite its potential importance, the signals regulating mutant p53 protein expression are not known. Here we show that a form of p53 that is incapable of binding DNA is overexpressed in the acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cell line. Our results demonstrate that treatment of NB4 cells with bryostatin-1, which induces differentiation in this cell line, leads to hyperphosphorylation of this DNA binding-impaired form of p53 via mitogen-activated protein kinase. After this phosphorylation, the p53 protein is degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of p53 hyperphosphorylation blocks p53 protein degradation and cell differentiation. In addition, inhibition of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway also blocks p53 protein degradation and cell differentiation. These findings suggest a role for mitogen-activated protein kinase in the degradation of the DNA binding-impaired form of p53 protein and in the bryostatin-induced differentiation observed in this cell line. The implications of these results with respect to the functional significance of p53 phosphorylation and degradation in cell differentiation are discussed.

The biochemical activity of p53 that is required for this relies on its ability to bind to specific DNA sequences and to function as a transcription factor (3Pietenpol J.A. Tokino T. Thiagalingam S. Ei-Deiry W.S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1998-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The importance of the activation of transcription by p53 is underscored by the fact that the majority of p53 mutations found in tumors are located within the domain required for sequence-specific DNA binding (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6695) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is clear that this activity is critical to the role of p53 in preventing proliferation. Although the precise molecular mechanisms by which mutant p53 loses its antiproliferation functions remain to be elucidated, three models have been proposed (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). First, mutations in p53 may result in a loss of tumor suppressor function. Second, mutant p53 may have a dominant negative effect over wild-type p53 activity. Finally, mutations in p53 may lead to “a gain of function” such that it can induce proliferation and promote tumorigenicity of various cells (4Zambetti G.P. Bargonetti J. Walker K. Prives C. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 5Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3735-3743Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).An important mechanism used to control p53 activity is the regulation of p53 protein levels. Regulation is primarily achieved via protein degradation, although p53 levels may also be controlled at the level of transcription (7Sun X. Shimizu H. Yamamoto K.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and translation (8Mosner J. Mummenbrauer J. Bauer C. Sczakiel G. Grosse F. Deppert W. EMBO. 1995; 14: 4442-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Studies with human papilloma virus E6 protein and cellular oncogene Mdm2, which interact with and lead to the degradation of p53, have revealed that p53 is degraded by the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway (9Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3654) Google Scholar, 10Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar, 11Storey A. Thomas M. Kalita A. Harwood C. Gardiol D. Mantovani F. Breuer J. Leigh I.M. Matlashewski G. Banks L. Nature. 1998; 393: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Although signals that target p53 for degradation are not yet fully understood, it is generally accepted that the phosphorylation status of p53 may be involved. As an illustration of this, cells treated with the serine phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid accumulate high levels of hyperphosphorylated wild-type p53 (12Zhang W. McClain C. Gau J.P. Guo X.Y. Deisseroth A.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4448-4453PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, the regulation of p53 protein level is important to its tumor suppressor function. Therefore, it follows that the regulation of mutant p53 protein levels may be important in regulating the oncogenic potential of mutant p53.In this study we examined the involvement of the p53 pathway in NB4 cell differentiation. The NB4 cell line was originally isolated from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia and is characterized by a translocation involving chromosomes 15 and 17 (13Lanotte M. Martin-Thouvenin V. Najman S. Ballerini P. Valensi F. Berger R. Blood. 1991; 77: 1080-1088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been used as a model for studying the mechanisms of cell differentiation, as it can be terminally differentiated into either mature neutrophilic granulocytes (14Gianni M. Terao M. Norio P. Barbui T. Rambaldi A. Garattini E. Blood. 1995; 85: 3619-3635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or monocyte/macrophage-like cells (15Bhatia M. Kirkland J.B. Meckling-Gill K.A. Leukemia (Baltimore). 1994; 8: 1744-1749PubMed Google Scholar) in response to various treatments. Among the treatments that have been shown to induce NB4 cells to differentiate into monocytes/macrophage-like cells are 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (16Song X.-D. Norman A.W. Leuk. Res. 1998; 22: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and bryostatin-1 (17Song X. Norman A.W. Leukemia. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanisms involved in this differentiation are not yet fully understood, it is clear that a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift analysis; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift analysis; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. pathway is involved (17Song X. Norman A.W. Leukemia. 1999; (in press)Google Scholar, 18Song X.-D. Bishop J.E. Okamura W.H. Norman A.W. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 457-46520Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate the amino terminus of p53 in vitro (19Milne D.M. Campbell D.G. Caudwell F.B. Meek D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9253-9260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a possible mechanism for bryostatin-induced differentiation may involve the phosphorylation of p53 via the MAPK pathway, resulting in an alteration of p53 antiproliferation activity.To address the question of whether the p53 pathway is involved in bryostatin-induced differentiation, we asked whether endogenous p53 is phosphorylated in response to bryostatin treatment. Our results show that p53 becomes hyperphosphorylated and that the p53 protein is degraded via the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway after treatment with bryostatin-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inhibition of p53 hyperphosphorylation by a MAPK pathway inhibitor, PD98059, blocks p53 protein degradation and cell differentiation. In addition, inhibition of p53 protein degradation also blocks cell differentiation. The correlation between these effects suggests a role for MAPK in p53 degradation and in the bryostatin-induced differentiation in this cell line. To assess the physiological significance of these observations, we examined the DNA binding ability of p53 purified from NB4 cells using anti-p53 antibody, Pab 421. The purified p53 was incapable of binding DNA in electrophoresis mobility shift analysis (EMSA), indicating that a mutant form of p53 exists in NB4 cells. These results suggest that following bryostatin treatment of NB4 cells, the mutant form of p53 is phosphorylated via the MAPK pathway and subsequently degraded. The implication of these observations with respect to the functional significance of p53 phosphorylation and degradation in cell differentiation are discussed.DISCUSSIONA requisite first step toward understanding the molecular mechanism for cell differentiation and proliferation is to identify the signal transduction pathways and the cellular targets of those pathways involved in these processes. In this paper we present biochemical evidence that indicates that the MAPK pathway, required for bryostatin-induced cell differentiation, induces p53 hyperphosphorylation, which subsequently reduces p53 protein stability. This observation is particularly significant because an altered form of p53, unable to bind DNA in vitro, is overexpressed in NB4 cells. It has been suggested that mutant p53 may gain a function such that it can promote tumorigenicity in various cells. Consequently, degradation of mutant p53 protein may result in a reduction of tumorigenicity. Taken together, our results indicate that an altered form of p53 is hyperphosphorylated via the MAPK pathway and subsequently degraded. Although a direct cause and effect relationship is yet to be established, our findings indicate that a reduction in mutant p53 levels may contribute to cell differentiation.Phosphorylation is one potential mechanism by which cells might regulate p53 protein levels and, hence, its antiproliferation activity. Experiments in vivo have clearly demonstrated that p53 is a phosphoprotein on which multiple phosphorylation sites have been identified (1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2282) Google Scholar). In comparison to wild-type p53, literature relating to the phosphorylation of mutant p53 and the control of its protein level is limited. In this study we provide in vivo evidence that a form of p53 which is incapable of binding DNA is hyperphosphorylated and subsequently degraded via the MAPK pathway, although it is not clear from these experiments whether MAPK phosphorylates this DNA binding-impaired form of p53 directly or whether additional kinases are required. Furthermore, our results suggest that phosphorylation of p53 leads to a reduction in protein stability mediated by the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway.The observation of a reduction in protein stability after phosphorylation is in contrast to previous reports in which phosphorylation of p53 led to an increase in its stability (12Zhang W. McClain C. Gau J.P. Guo X.Y. Deisseroth A.B. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4448-4453PubMed Google Scholar, 28Shieh S.-Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). However, in agreement with our findings, two proto-oncogene-encoded transcription factors, c-Jun and BCL-6, have also been shown to be degraded after phosphorylation by MAPK (29Musti A.M. Treier M. Bohmann D. Science. 1997; 275: 400-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 30Niu H. Ye B.H. Dalla-Favera R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1953-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, degradation of oncogene products, including mutant p53, may represent a general mechanism by which the MAPK pathway controls cell function. Reduction of p53 protein levels was observed 12 h after bryostatin treatment, which is slower than the 2 h reported for BCL and c-Jun. It is possible that MAPK may mediate a second signal required for the reduction of p53 protein levels. Nevertheless, our data show that a strong correlation exists between p53 protein phosphorylation and stability.The finding that mutant p53 is phosphorylated via the MAPK pathway and subsequently degraded has several implications when considering the model in which mutations in p53 lead to a gain of function that promotes tumorigenicity. First, overexpression of mutant p53 in pre-B (31Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), fibroblast (5Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 4: 42-46Crossref Scopus (789) Google Scholar), and osteosarcoma cells (32Sun Y. Nakamura K. Wendel E. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has been shown to dramatically enhance the tumorigenicity of these cells. Reduction in p53 protein levels, therefore, may be of significance in preventing cell proliferation. Indeed, our data demonstrate a strong correlation between protein degradation and cell differentiation. Second, the high frequency of p53 mutations in human cancers warrants a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms of the gain of function of mutant p53 and the signals that may regulate this function. In this paper we go some way toward this goal by presenting evidence that the MAPK pathway is involved in degradation of the DNA binding-impaired form of p53 and by correlating this function with NB4 cell differentiation. Finally, a significant research effort is concerned with finding strategies to inactivate mutant p53. In light of the results presented here, it may also be effective to develop therapies designed to reduce mutant p53 protein levels. Studies of human and mouse p53 have shown that wild-type p53 exerts its antiproliferation function by inducing growth arrest and apoptosis, whereas mutant p53 loses this function (1Ko L.J. Prives C.

First, overexpression of mutant p53 in pre-B (31Shaulsky G. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6565-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), fibroblast (5Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 4: 42-46Crossref Scopus (789) Google Scholar), and osteosarcoma cells (32Sun Y. Nakamura K. Wendel E. Colburn N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2827-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has been shown to dramatically enhance the tumorigenicity of these cells. Reduction in p53 protein levels, therefore, may be of significance in preventing cell proliferation. Indeed, our data demonstrate a strong correlation between protein degradation and cell differentiation. Second, the high frequency of p53 mutations in human cancers warrants a detailed analysis of the molecular mechanisms of the gain of function of mutant p53 and the signals that may regulate this function. In this paper we go some way toward this goal by presenting evidence that the MAPK pathway is involved in degradation of the DNA binding-impaired form of p53 and by correlating this function with NB4 cell differentiation. Finally, a significant research effort is concerned with finding strategies to inactivate mutant p53. In light of the results presented here, it may also be effective to develop therapies designed to reduce mutant p53 protein levels.

Calorimetric studies were performed on more than 60 LDL preparations, and the transition temperature, which varied between 19 and 32 °C, was correlated to the chemical composition and revealed a discontinuity at a critical cholesteryl ester to triglyceride ratio of approximately 7:1. For electron spin resonance studies, several LDL preparations were probed with spin-labeled cholesteryl esters and triglycerides, respectively. In LDL with a high triglyceride content, both labels exhibited similar mobility behavior. In contrast, in LDL with only small concentrations of triglycerides, the behavior of labeled cholesteryl esters and labeled triglycerides differed distinctly. The cholesteryl esters were strongly immobilized below the transition temperature, whereas the triglycerides remained fluid throughout the measured temperatures. These results suggest that the critical cholesteryl ester to triglyceride mass ratio of 7:1 corresponds to two concentric compartments with a radial ratio of 2:1, where the liquid triglycerides occupy the core, and the cholesteryl esters form the frozen shell. At higher triglyceride contents, the triglyceride molecules insert into the cholesteryl ester shell and depress the peak transition temperature of the LDL core, whereas at lower triglyceride contents, excess cholesteryl esters are dissolved in the core.

These particles represent complex supramolecular assemblies of phospholipids (∼20% of the total mass), free (∼12%) and esterified (∼40%) cholesterol, triglycerides (∼5–10%), and a single copy of apolipoprotein B-100, a glycoprotein of 4,536 amino acids (2Knott T.J.

In addition, LDL transports minor amounts of lipophilic vitamins and drugs (5Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgens G. Free Rad. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2125) Google Scholar). The structure of LDL can be described, in general terms, by a quasispherical core-shell model, in which the apolar constituents (cholesteryl esters (CE) and triglycerides (TG)) form a hydrophobic core of about 150 Å diameter, whereas the phospholipids, most of the unesterified cholesterol, and the apoprotein form an outer surface monolayer with a thickness of about 30 Å (6Laggner P. Müller K. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1978; 11: 371-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 7Atkinson D. Small D.M. Annu. Biophys.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1995: 371-386Crossref Google Scholar). In this general sense, LDL would appear to fit readily into the structural core-shell scheme of circulating lipoproteins (9Shen B.W. Scanu A.M. Kézdy F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, LDL exhibits a distinct physical feature that makes it unique among all structural elements of blood: it is the only component to undergo a major structural transition just below physiological body temperature, in the range between 15 and 32 °C (10Deckelbaum R.J. Shipley G.G. Small D.M. Lees R.S. George P.K. Science. 1975; 190: 392-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Deckelbaum R.J. Shipley G.G. Small D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 744-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transition temperature varies among individual donors and is correlated to the core lipid composition. This lipid-melting transition directly affects the molecular packing in the core of LDL, i.e. approximately half of the particle mass (12Laggner P. Degovics G. Müller K.W. Glatter O. Kostner G.M. Holasek A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1977; 358: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Atkinson D. Deckelbaum R.J. Small D.M. Shipley G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The local molecular dynamics and polarities in the surface monolayer, including apolipoprotein B, are affected indirectly, such that the transition can be recognized from the particle surface (14Laggner P. Kostner G.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 84: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 15Herak J.N. Pifat G. Brnjas-Kraljevic J. Lipka G. Müller K. Knipping G. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1988; 48: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As to the actual transition process, it is generally assumed that it occurs between a low temperature state, in which CE and TG molecules are rigidly packed with their long molecular axes radially arranged in two concentric shells of approximately 36 Å radii each, and a fluid, oily droplet state above the transition (12Laggner P. Degovics G. Müller K.W. Glatter O. Kostner G.M. Holasek A. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1977; 358: 771-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,13Atkinson D. Deckelbaum R.J. Small D.M. Shipley G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1042-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A quantitative description of the two states and of the processes involved in the transition is still lacking. However, more detailed structural information is required to understand the biochemical effects of the transition. Several important biological activities of LDL have been shown to be tightly controlled by the physical state of the core lipids: the activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (16Zechner R. Kostner G.M. Dieplinger H. Degovics G. Laggner P. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1984; 36: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and of CE transfer protein (17Morton R.E. Parks J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1915-1923PubMed Google Scholar) and the susceptibility of LDL to copper-induced lipid peroxidation (18Schuster B. Prassl R. Nigon F. Chapman M.J. Laggner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2509-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The present study was performed to obtain detailed information on the relationship between core lipid composition and the physical states involved in the transition, by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses of a large number (n > 60) of LDL subspecies. Defined LDL particle subspecies have the advantage over the broad continuum of total LDL of possessing a high degree of structural homogeneity with respect to hydrated density, chemical composition, and physicochemical properties (19Chapman M.J. Laplaud P.M. Luc G. Forgez P. Bruckert E. Goulinet S. Lagrange D. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 442-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The range of chemical compositions of the core lipids covered in this study exceeds that of previous studies, particularly with respect to the upper limits of triglyceride content. The composition dependence of the calorimetric core melting transition temperature revealed a hitherto undetected break at CE/TG ratios (w/w) of about 7:1, which does not occur in isolated lipid systems of the same composition (20Small D.M. The Physical Chemistry of Lipids : From Alkanes to Phospholipids (Anonymous). Plenum Press, New York1986: 395-473Crossref Google Scholar, 21Ekman S. Lundberg B. Acta Chem. Scand.

This discontinuity suggests that a microphase separation occurs at this point, i.e. a partial demixing of CE and TG molecules, a phenomenon that was investigated further by electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) using CE and TG spin labels. Our results demonstrate that the triglycerides remain in a fluid state even below the lipid transition temperature. By combining our present findings with earlier small angle x-ray and neutron scattering data, we now propose a substantially refined structural model of the LDL particle. 16-DSA (2-(14-carboxytetradecyl)-2-ethyl-4,4-dimethyl-3-oxazolidinyloxyl), 5-DSA (2-(3-carboxypropyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-tridecyl-3-oxazolidinyloxyl), cholesterol, dioleylglycerol (mixed isomeres), egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, and triolein were obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Pefablock and trypsin inhibitor (both for biochemical purposes) were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), gentamycin (research grade) from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany), and all other chemicals were of analytical grade. Distinct homogeneous LDL subspecies were used for all experiments. LDL was isolated from human plasma, and discontinuous density gradients were fractionated as described earlier (19Chapman M.J. Laplaud P.M. Luc G. Forgez P. Bruckert E. Goulinet S. Lagrange D. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 442-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subspecies used for this study were in a density range of 1.0244–1.0435 g/ml; 90% of LDL in normolipidemic human plasma possess hydrated densities in this range. The LDL preparations were dialyzed exhaustively in the dark at 4 °C against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, i.e.10 mm phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4/KH2PO4), 150 mm NaCl, 270 μm EDTA, and 50 mg/liter gentamycin. Phosphate-buffered saline was deoxygenated in a vacuum followed by purging with nitrogen gas. To prevent oxidation, LDL was stored in the dark at 4 °C in an argon atmosphere. Total and free cholesterol were determined with CHOD-PAP enzymatic test kits (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). Cholesteryl ester content was calculated as (total cholesterol − free cholesterol) × 1.67. This factor represents the ratio of the average molecular weight of cholesteryl ester to free cholesterol. Phospholipids and triglycerides were assayed by two enzymatic kit tests (bioMérieux, France). Protein was measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA assay, Pierce, The Netherlands). The spin-labeled lipids were synthesized by the pyrrolidinopyridine method (23Patel K.M. Sklar L.A. Currie R. Pownall H.J. Morrisett J.D. Sparrow J.T. Lipids. 1979; 14: 816-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Either dioleylglycerol or cholesterol was brought to reaction at room temperature with 16-DSA in the presence of pyrrolidinopyridine andN,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. 16-Doxylstearoylcholesterylester (16-CE) and (16-doxylstearoly)dioleylglycerol (16-TG) were separated by chromatography on a Silicacolumn (Mega Bond Elut-SI, 1 g, Varian). The purity of the products was checked by thin layer chromatography (for 16-CE/ethyl acetate/hexane (9:3, v/v); for 16-TG: chloroform/acetone/acetic acid (96:4:1, v/v/v)). Microemulsions were prepared by codissolving egg yolk phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and the desired amount of spin probe (5:1:5 molar ratio) in chloroform (24Craig I.F. Via D.P. Sherrill B.C. Sklar L.A. Mantulin W.W. Gotto Jr., A.M. Smith L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 330-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The chloroform was evaporated in a nitrogen stream and the dry lipid film redissolved in 15–30 μl of 2-propanol at 37 °C. The 2-propanol solution was injected rapidly into phosphate-buffered saline. This method to prepare microemulsions does not lead to particles of defined composition and size, which are not required in this case as they only serve as a substrate for TG or CE transfer. In a typical transfer preparation, 12 mg of LDL protein was incubated with microemulsions containing 3 mg of spin label (the amount of 2-propanol did not exceed 0.5% of the total incubation mixture) and 300–400 mg of lipoprotein-deficient plasma (d > 1.21 g/ml), a source of CE transfer protein at 37 °C (25Granot E. Deckelbaum R.J. Eisenberg S. Oschry Y. Bengtsson-Olivecrona G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The total volume of the mixture was 6 ml. The tubes were flushed with argon and placed in a water bath at 37 °C for 5 h (16-CE), or for 24 h (16-TG). After incubation, the labeled LDL was reisolated using the following procedure. The density of the incubation mixture was adjusted to 1.41 g/ml. About 1.2 ml of mixture was transferred to a centrifugation tube and overlayered with solutions of 1.080, 1.050, and 1.000 g/ml (1.2 ml each). After centrifugation (Sorvall OTD 65B centrifuge, AH-650 rotor) at 4 °C for 24 h at 40,000 rpm, the LDL fraction was removed using a bent needle. Spin-labeled LDL was concentrated using Centricon 10 concentrators (Amicon, MA) to a final concentration of 7 mg/ml protein. For preparations of spin labels in pure triolein or olive oil, lipids were dissolved in chloroform and deposited as a dry, thin film on the glass tubing. Triolein or olive oil was added and incubated with moderate mixing for 10 min at room temperature. For ascorbate quenching, the solutions of ascorbic acid 3*10−3m were prepared immediately before use (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1 g/liter EDTA, pH 7.4) and added to the sample at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v). The ESR signal was measured as quickly as possible after mixing (after approximately 4 min). All ascorbate-quenching measurements were performed at 37 °C. Calorimetry experiments were performed on the high sensitivity, differential adiabatic scanning microcalorimeter DASM-4 (Biobribor, Pushtchino, Russia) designed by Privalov (26Privalov P.L. Pure Appl. Chem. 1980; 52: 479-497Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The scanning rate was 1 °C/min; samples (1–2 mg/ml total LDL cholesterol) were loaded into the calorimeter sample cell at room temperature, and an equal amount of buffer was loaded into the reference cell. The cells were pressurized with nitrogen to 250 kilopascals (2.5 bar). Heat capacity functions were obtained after base-line subtraction and normalization of experimental data, given in μW, to heat capacity units (J/°C/g of CE). Data were collected on heating runs from 1 °C to 45 °C. Each sample was scanned two or three times and held at 1 °C for approximately 30 min between runs. The transition temperature (T m) was taken as the point of maximum change in heat capacity in the heat capacity versustemperature curves. ESR measurements were performed in glass capillaries (1-mm inner diameter) on an X-band Bruker ECS 106 ESR spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, Germany). The following settings were used for determination of the rotational correlation times: microwave power, 2 mW; modulation amplitude, 1 G; modulation frequency, 100 KHz; scan width, 100 G. The temperature was controlled to within ± 0.1 °C by a Bruker temperature controller B-VT 2000. The initial temperature was 4 °C and was increased stepwise to 40 °C. The preparations were allowed to equilibrate for at least 5 min at each temperature before data acquisition. 10–20 scans were accumulated per temperature point. The determination of the spectral parameters used in the evaluation of ESR data is shown in Fig. 3 A. Correlation times (τc) for the approximately isotropic motion were calculated from line widths W 0 as described by Kivelson (27Kivelson D. J. Chem. Phys. 1967; 46: 3048-3052Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) τc=(6.5×10−10)W0((h0/h−1)½−1)Equation 1 where h 0 and h −1refer to first derivative line heights of the midfield line and the highfield line, respectively. For the sample of 16-CE in LDL displaying a high CE/TG weight ratio, it was not possible to determine the rotational correlation time because of the more anisotropic motion of this spin label. Equation 1 cannot be used for anisotropic spectra with relatively slow motion. Thus, as a parameter related to the motional characteristics, the ratioh 0/h −1 has to be used (28Smith I.C.P. Swartz H.M. Bolton R.B. Borg D.C. Biological Applications of Electron Spin Resonance. John Wiley & Sons, New York1972: 483-539Google Scholar, 29Krieger M. Peterson J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3330-3333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the polarity of the environment of the spin probes, the isotropic hyperfine couplinga n′ was used: aN′=1/3(A∥+2A⊥)Equation 2 where 2A ∥ and 2A ⊥ are the outer and the inner hyperfine splitting of the spin probe, respectively (30Hubbell W.L. McConnell H.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 314-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar, 31Seelig J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1970; 92: 3881-3887Crossref Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We first present the calorimetric data that lead to the postulation of a microphase separation of apolar lipids in the LDL core. DSC analysis and determination of the actualT m were performed on a large number (n > 60) of discrete LDL subspecies isolated from several single donors. The average composition of the subspecies that were analyzed in this study is presented in Fig.1. The use of LDL subspecies, which are highly homogeneous and well defined with respect to their physicochemical properties (19Chapman M.J. Laplaud P.M. Luc G. Forgez P. Bruckert E. Goulinet S. Lagrange D. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 442-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Dejager S. Bruckert E. Chapman M.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 295-308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33McNamara J.R. Small D.M. Li Z.L. Schaefer E.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1924-1935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), presents a significant and major advantage and is absolutely necessary for such experiments. Unfractionated LDL, or even worse, LDL isolated from plasma pools of many donors, can obscure findings as a result of its marked heterogeneity. The presence of various transition temperatures and chemical compositions in the same preparation would make it impossible to discuss differences in thermotropic behavior reliably. The transition temperatures of the LDL core varied between 15 and 32 °C, although most samples fell into the range of 24–30 °C. The weight ratio of CE to TG was chosen as chemical parameter because CE and TG are the principal LDL core lipids. When free cholesterol was included in the calculations, the results were unaffected. PlottingT m versus the weight ratio of CE/TG (Fig. 2) led to the observation that a single linear approximation was insufficient to fit the data points. Rather, it appeared that a discontinuity occurred at CE/TG ratios of approximately 7. Such a discontinuity in the concentration dependence of a transition temperature in a mixed lipid system is a clear indicator of a phase separation at this point. To understand the molecular basis of this nonlinear behavior further and to obtain additional evidence concerning the hypothesis that a microphase separation occurs within the core lipids, spin probes were introduced into the LDL core, and the mobility and polarity of their environment were investigated (Fig.3). Temperature series of ESR measurements were performed on various LDL subspecies labeled either with 16-CE or with 16-TG. To characterize the situation above and below the break point in the plot ofT m versus CE/TG ratio (see Fig. 2), some representative measurements are introduced. At high CE/TG ratios, the 16-CE label incorporated into the LDL core displayed two distinctly different types of spectrum. ESR spectra recorded at T < T m showed line shapes that are characteristic for anisotropic motion, as is most clearly reflected in the splitting of the low field line (seearrows in Fig. 4 A). At T > T m, the motion of the spin-labeled CE became a more isotropic one but still remained restricted as seen by the relatively broad spectral lines. Because of the anisotropic slow motion of the label, the line/height ratio was used to follow the temperature course (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, the recorded spectra for 16-TG-labeled subspecies with a high CE/TG ratio display a rather isotropic behavior (Fig.4 B). The temperature dependence of the rotational correlation time τc showed no change aroundT m (Fig. 4 D), contrary to the temperature profile of 16-CE. At the other extreme of the CE/TG range, one has to examine the situation at a CE/TG ratio below 7. In this case, the behavior of 16-CE and 16-TG labels in the LDL core are almost identical. One cannot distinguish between LDL subspecies labeled with 16-CE or with 16-TG on the basis of their spectral parameters (see Fig.5, A and B). Neither the spectra of 16-CE nor of 16-TG reveal the degree of immobilization displayed with 16-CE in LDL with a high CE/TG ratio. Also, at T > T m, a highly mobile situation is reached. Plotting τc versus T results in essentially congruent plots (Fig. 5, C and D). To compare the behavior of 16-TG in LDL with that in a TG-rich environment, the ESR spectra of 16-TG were measured in olive oil and triolein. The spectra of 16-TG in LDL of CE/TG ratio > 7 and those in olive oil or triolein showed the same spectral characteristics but were shifted by about 20 °C (Fig.6). Results for 16-TG in triolein and in olive oil were identical. The notion that 16-TG within LDL with a CE/TG ratio > 7 is located in a TG-rich domain is supported by comparing τcfor 16-TG in olive oil and LDL. In this case, the same temperature-dependent decrease with an almost identical decay constant of the regression fits was observed. Furthermore, the isotropic hyperfine couplinga n ′was calculated to obtain information on the polarity of the 16-TG environment (data not shown). These calculations clearly reveal that 16-TG is located in a low polarity environment. Somewhat surprising is the fact that the polarity of 16-TG in olive oil is higher than the polarity of 16-TG in LDL, despite the presence of groups that increase the polarity of LDL (hydroxyl group of cholesterol, ester groups, etc.). The degree of unsaturation in LDL is similar to that in olive oil. We tend to assume that mobility effects play a role in the determination of polarity through a n′. In any case, however, these results confirm that 16-TG is located in an extremely apolar environment in LDL. To assure the validity of the results, it was essential to confirm that the lipid spin labels were intimately associated with and situated in the core of LDL particles. This question was approached by use of ascorbate quenching. Ascorbate is one of the most efficient water-soluble reducing agents for nitroxide radicals (34Gotoh N. Noguchi N. Tsuchiya J. Morita K. Sakai H. Shimasaki H. Niki E. Free Rad. Res. 1996; 24: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 35Kveder M. Pifat G. Pecar S. Schara M. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1994; 70: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To determine the accessibility of each spin-labeled lipid type within LDL to the aqueous phase and to verify the location of the spin labels in the LDL core, the rates of ascorbate-induced reduction of the nitroxyl moiety in the LDL core and in the microemulsions labeled with either 16-CE or 16-TG were examined by monitoring the loss of the ESR signal. Adding ascorbate solution to LDL preparations containing 16-TG or 16-CE resulted in a very slow loss of ESR signal intensity. The ESR signal remained stable for a period of more than 2 h. On the contrary, the addition of ascorbate solution to the microemulsion containing either large quantities of 16-CE or 16-TG led to an almost immediate (approximately 5 min) loss of paramagnetism. Comparing the rate of reduction with that of 5-DSA and 16-DSA in LDL, it can be stated that 16-TG and 16-CE in LDL were reduced by a lower rate (Fig.7). These observations confirm the notion that the 16-CE and 16-TG spin probes were localized in the core of the LDL particle (see Fig. 8).Figure 8Cross-sectional model for the proposed arrangement of the CE and TG in the LDL core at two representative CE/TG ratios. A and B show the situation below T m and C, aboveT m. The symbols used for CE, TG, free cholesterol (FC), phospholipids (PL), and apolipoprotein B (apoB) are indicated in the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To ensure that the integrity of LDL was not impaired by the incubation and reisolation processes, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed. The labeled LDL behaved in the same manner as the control preparation. The present results strongly suggest that the apolar lipids TG and CE, in the core of LDL, undergo phase separation below the core lipid transition. This finding is at variance with most of the models proposed in the literature, and it is therefore necessary to recall the evidence that has led to these models. Before that, however, a more general feature of a quasispherical core-shell model, as is consistent with LDL, has to be considered. The relative weight of the shells varies with the third power of the radius, such that the innermost parts are only a very minor fraction. For instance, in a three-shell structure with radii 1:2:3, the core contributes only 3.7% to the total volume. Therefore, any mass-dependent measurement, ase.g. SAXS, SANS, or NMR, will attain the limits of resolution in terms of the definition of the details of core structure. On the other hand, molecular probe methods such as spin probe ESR, which rely inherently on the exclusive signal from the probe, are not limited by such restraints as long as the probe can be considered nonperturbing. Similarly, DSC signals from a melting transition are sensitive to minor contamination of the melting matrix, which would hardly be detectable by scattering or NMR methods. This feature makes the methods chosen in this study well suited for studies of questions concerning the state of a minority component (TG) in the excess of a second component (CE). Key evidence for the presently most widely accepted model of the neutral lipid core in LDL has come from the combined x-ray and calorimetric studies by Deckelbaum et al. (10Deckelbaum R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2061047348,"NF-Y is a sequence-specific evolutionary conserved activator binding to CCAAT boxes with high affinity and specificity. It is a trimer formed by NF-YA and two putative histone-like subunits, NF-YB and NF-YC, showing similarity to histones H2B and H2A, respectively. We investigated the relationships between NF-Y and chromatin using an Artemia franciscana chromatin assembly system with plasmids containing the Major HistoCompatibility complex class II Ea promoter. The NF-Y trimer, but not single subunits, protects the Y box in the presence of reconstituted chromatin, and it can bind the target sequence during and after assembly. Using reconstitution assays with purified chicken histones, we show that NF-Y associates with preformed nucleosomes. Translational analysis of various Ea fragments of identical length in which the CCAAT box is at different positions indicated that the lateral fragment was slightly more prone to NF-Y binding. In competition experiments, NF-Y is able to prevent formation of nucleosomes significantly. These data support the idea that NF-Y is a gene-specific activator with a built-in capacity to interface with chromatin structures."

X-ray crystallographic structure analysis has shown the folding pattern of the polypeptide chain of tetrameric TPL from C. freundiito be similar to that of dimeric aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) (11Antson A.A.

Despite their similarity in secondary and tertiary structure, the two enzymes show only low sequence identity, e.g. 23% between TPL ofC. freundii and AspAT of Escherichia coli. AspAT catalyzes the reversible transamination reaction of the dicarboxylicl-amino acids aspartate and glutamate with the cognate 2-oxo acids 2-oxoglutarate and oxalacetate. The structures of the active sites of TPL and AspAT are similar; most of the residues that participate in the binding of the coenzyme and the α-carboxylate group of the substrate in AspAT (12Kirsch J.F.

Obviously, these two homologous enzymes use the same protein scaffold to catalyze different reactions with different substrates. Thus, alteration of the specificity of a given enzyme by substitution of a limited number of critical amino acid residues seems feasible. Alignments of amino acid sequences of homologous enzymes may be used to identify the residues underlying the differences in their reaction and substrate specificity. Substitution of the residues to which the substrate binds has proven successful in changing the substrate specificity of several enzymes without destroying their catalytic apparatus (14Wilks H.M.

This paper reports a homology modeling approach that, together with information obtained from structural and mechanistic studies of AspAT, was used to redesign the substrate specificity of TPL in favor of dicarboxylic amino acids. Plasmid pTZTPL (22Chen H. Gollnick P. Phillips R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 540-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) containing the entire coding sequence of C. freundiityrosine phenol-lyase was used as template for in vitromutagenesis. The tpl gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the following two synthetic oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-CGCGCGTCGACATAATTATTATTTAGTGATGATGATGATGATGGATATAGTCAAAGCG-3′ and 5′-GCGGAGATCTAACTCACTG-3′. The first oligonucleotide hybridizes to the 5′ part of the tpl gene and contains six histidine codons (italics), in frame, just before the stop codon and a new SalI site (underlined). The second oligonucleotide hybridizes to the unique BglII site (underlined) in the tpl gene upstream to the transcriptional start point. The resulting 1.9-kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction product was cut with BglII andSalI and subcloned into the BamHI-SalI sites of the expression vector pTZ18U (Bio-Rad) to generate pTZTPL-His. The mutants were prepared by polymerase chain reaction from pTZTPL-His using the QuikChangeTM Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit from Stratagene and the following primer pairs: R100Ta, 5′-CCTACTCACCAGGGGACCGGCGCAGAAAACCTG-3′; R100Tb, 5′-CAGGTTTTCTGCGCCGGTCCCCTGGTGAGTAGG-3′; V283Ra, 5′-CTTCGTACACACGGACTAAC-3′; and V283Rb, 5′-GTTAGTCCGTGTGTACGAAG-3′. The insertion of the histidine codons and the mutations was verified by cycle sequencing (Sequi Therm Long-Read Cycle Sequencing Kit-LC, Epicentre Technologies) with fluorescent primers using a DNA sequencer (LI-COR). E. coli SVS370 cells were used as host for the pTZTPL-His and the mutant plasmids. The cells, grown as described previously (22Chen H. Gollnick P. Phillips R.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 540-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), were thawed and suspended in 5 ml of Buffer A (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm PLP, pH 8.0) per gram of wet weight. The cells were disrupted by three passages through a French press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 25,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter and directly applied onto a 13 × 1-cm column containing 2–3 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with Buffer A containing 20 mmimidazole until A 280 of the flow-through solution was below 0.01. The TPL protein was then eluted with a 30-ml gradient from 20 to 250 mm imidazole in Buffer A. The pooled TPL fractions were dialyzed extensively against 0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 0.1 mm PLP, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Purified wild-type and mutant TPLs were stable at least for 1 year when stored at −70 °C in the same buffer at a concentration of 2–5 mg/ml. All preparations were pure as indicated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10–15% PHAST-gel from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The concentration of purified TPLs was determined photometrically ( E2781% = 8.37; Ref. 5Kumagai H. Yamada H. Matsui H. Ohkishi H. Ogata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1767-1772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) assuming a subunit molecular mass of 52.3 kDa (13Antson A.A. Demidkina T.V. Gollnick P. Dauter Z. Von Tersch R.L. Long J.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4195-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) which takes into account the molecular mass of the His6 tag (0.84 kDa). The PLP content of the enzymes was determined from the absorption spectrum of the enzyme in 0.1 m NaOH, assuming ε388 = 6600m−1 cm−1 (23Peterson E.A. Sober H.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 169-175Crossref Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Prior to recording absorption spectra, the stock enzyme was incubated with 0.5 mm PLP for 1 h at 30 °C and then separated from excess PLP on a short desalting column (NAPTM 5, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0. Absorption spectra were measured with a 8453 UV-visible diode-array spectrophotometer from Hewlett-Packard. The activity of the TPLs toward various amino acid substrates was measured using the coupled assay with lactate dehydrogenase and NADH previously described for tryptophan indole-lyase (24Morino Y. Snell E.E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17A: 439-446Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm PLP, 0.2 mm NADH, 24 units of lactate dehydrogenase from bovine heart (Sigma), and varying concentrations of amino acid substrate in a final volume of 1 ml at 25 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of TPL and followed by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Steady-state kinetic values of k cat and K m were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using ORIGIN software (Microcal Software). Mutant TPLs and wild-type enzyme were incubated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, with different amino acids as substrates. Samples were withdrawn at different times and immediately deproteinized with 1m perchloric acid (25Kochhar S. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After derivatization with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-l-alanine amide (26Marfey P. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1984; 49: 591-596Crossref Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), the reaction samples were loaded onto a reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography column (Aquapore RP-300; 250 × 4.6-mm). Both pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP), produced by the single turnover half-reaction of transamination, and the products of racemization can be separated and detected photometrically at 340 nm by this sensitive assay (27Kochhar S. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 175: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the increase in absorbance at 325 nm was used to follow the production of PMP. Protein was eliminated from the reaction mixture prior to chromatography by precipitation with 1m perchloric acid (25Kochhar S. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thin layer chromatography was performed on pre-coated silica gel plates SIL G-25 from Macherey-Nagel in n-pentyl formate/chloroform/formic acid (20:70:10, v/v). A slightly alkaline solution of bromcresol green (0.02% in ethanol) was used to develop the chromatogram. The acids appeared as yellow spots on a blue background (28Hansen S.A. J. Chromatogr. 1976; 124: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Formic acid was determined with the formate dehydrogenase assay. A kit from Boehringer Mannheim was used according to the supplier's protocol. Briefly, mutant TPLs were incubated at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, with l-aspartate as substrate. Samples were withdrawn at different times and immediately deproteinized with perchloric acid. Formate was quantitated by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm due to NAD+ reduction. The crystal structure of the holoenzyme complex with the substrate analog 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (Brookhaven Protein Data Bank, code2TPL) was used as parent structure. The substrate analog was replaced by l-tyrosine, and the external aldimine form 1(Scheme FS1) was created by introducing a double bond between C4′ and the nitrogen atom of the substrate. Removal of the Cα-hydrogen, change of the hybridization of the Cα atom fromsp 3 to sp 2, and subsequent minimization led to the quinonoid intermediate 2. Molecular dynamics simulations of this intermediate were performed using the Discover program (Molecular Simulations) with the consistent valence force field. The cell multipole method was used instead of a cut-off for the nonbonded interactions. The temperature was set to 400 K. All hydrogen atoms and explicit water molecules were included in the simulations with time steps of 1 fs. At the beginning, the whole system was minimized for 2000 steps. The outer shell was then kept fixed, and another 2000 steps of minimization were applied. This was followed by a molecular dynamics simulation, which was initialized at 400 K for 1000 fs. After this initialization, the outer shell was again kept fixed. The simulation was continued for a total time of 20 ps. Every 100 fs the potential energy was analyzed. Within each picosecond, only the structure with the lowest potential energy was stored, resulting in a total of 20 low energy structures. All these 20 structures were then minimized for 2500 steps. The resulting minimized structures were found to be generally quite similar, and one of these corresponding to the average structure was chosen as starting point for all further simulations. The modeled structure of the wild-type enzyme withl-aspartate as substrate was obtained by replacement ofl-tyrosine and applying the same minimization-dynamics procedure as for the wild-type structure with l-tyrosine as substrate. To model the double mutant enzyme, we replaced Arg-100 by a threonine and Val-283 by an arginine residue and applied again the minimization-dynamics procedure. In order to change the substrate specificity of TPL in favor of dicarboxylic amino acids, we compared TPL with AspAT using homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulations. The specificity of AspAT for dicarboxylic amino acids and oxo acids seems to be based primarily on the salt bridge-hydrogen bond interaction of the side chain of Arg-292 (of the adjacent subunit) with the distal carboxylate group of these substrates (12Kirsch J.F. Eichele G. Ford G.C. Vincent M.G. Jansonius J.N. Gehring H. Christen P. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 174: 497-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). In agreement with this notion, Arg-292 is conserved among all AspATs (29Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since the sequence identity between AspAT and TPL is too low (23%) to allow the use of standard alignment algorithms, comparison of their three-dimensional structures (13Antson A.A. Demidkina T.V. Gollnick P. Dauter Z. Von Tersch R.L. Long J. Berezhnoy S.N. Phillips R.S. Harutyunyan E.H. Wilson K.S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4195-4206Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Jäger J.

Val-283 in TPL seems to occupy the same position as Arg-292 in AspAT. Another significant difference in the active sites of these two enzymes is the replacement of a residue interacting with the phosphate group of the coenzyme. Arg-100 in TPL apparently corresponds to Thr-109 in AspAT which is also conserved among all AspATs (Figs. 1 and 2; Ref. 29Mehta P.K. Hale T.I. Christen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar).Figure 2Sequence alignment of C. freundiiTPL and E. coliAspAT with the program DALI (Ref.31Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol.

However, the orientation of the leaving group of the substrate relative to the planar coenzyme-substrate adduct did not appear to be optimum for a β-elimination reaction. Positively charged Arg-100 in the hydrophobic active site of TPL interacted with the distal carboxylate group of dicarboxylic substrates and thus perturbed the required orthogonal orientation of the plane defined by Cα, Cβ, and Cγ of the amino acid substrate relative to the plane defined by the π system of the coenzyme-substrate adduct including Cβ (Scheme FS1; Ref.33Dunathan H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This notion agrees with previous studies by Faleev et al. (34Faleev N.G. Ruvinov S.B. Demidkina T.V. Myagkikh I.V. Gololobov M.Y. Bakhmutov V.I. Belikov V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) who have reported that aspartic and glutamic acid are not substrates but, in view of the low hydrophobicity of their side chains, anomalously strong inhibitors of TPL (K i = 3.5 and 5.0 mm, respectively). We concluded that the introduction of an arginine residue into position 283 of TPL together with the substitution of Arg-100 with an uncharged residue, i.e. the double mutation R100T/V283R, might mimic the binding site for dicarboxylic substrates of AspAT and thus result in a corresponding alteration in the substrate specificity of TPL. The C-terminal His6 tag did not interfere with the β-elimination activity of the enzyme (Table I). The His-tagged TPL R100T/V283R enzyme and the single mutant TPL R100T were purified and used for analysis. The single mutant V283R enzyme, however, could not be expressed as soluble protein. The PLP content of the mutant proteins was found to be 1 mol/mol of subunit, as has been shown previously for wild-type TPL (36Kazakov V.K. Myagkikh I.V. Tomina I.I. Demidkina T.V. Biokhimiya. 1987; 52: 1319-1323Google Scholar). The UV-visible spectrum of the PLP form of the mutant enzymes is almost identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. Apparently, the topochemistry of the PLP-binding site is not significantly altered by the mutations.Table IKinetic parameters for β-elimination reaction of tyrosine phenol-lyase wild-type, R100T, and R100T/V283R mutantsSubstrateaThe concentration ranges of the tested amino acids were as follows: 10–200 mm for dicarboxylic amino acids; 0.2–2 mm for l-tyrosine.Wild-type enzymeR100TR100T/V283Rk catK mk cat/K mk catK mk cat/K mk catK mk cat/K ms−1mmm−1s−1s−1mmm−1s−1s−1mmm−1s−1l-Tyrosine3.70.21.85 × 1040.54bOwing to the low solubility of tyrosine (up to 2 mm), these values are less certain than those of the TPL R100T/V283R.8.3bOwing to the low solubility of tyrosine (up to 2 mm), these values are less certain than those of the TPL R100T/V283R.65.1bOwing to the low solubility of tyrosine (up to 2 mm), these values are less certain than those of the TPL R100T/V283R.0.110.32343.8l-AspartateActivity below detection0.035560.630.21543.9l-GlutamateActivity below detection0.08155.40.105.318.9l-2-AminoadipateActivity below detection0.095cSaturation was not apparent within the concentration range tested.

Wild-type TPL in the presence of l-tyrosine exhibits a visible absorbance peak at about 500 nm attributable to the quinonoid coenzyme-substrate adduct 2 (Scheme FS1; Ref. 8Kumagai H. Kashima N. Yamada H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 39: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Some other amino acids such as l- and d-alanine,l-phenylalanine, l-aspartic acid,l-methionine, and l-homoserine, which are not substrates for β-elimination, form stable quinonoid intermediates with wild-type TPL (34Faleev N.G. Ruvinov S.B. Demidkina T.V. Myagkikh I.V. Gololobov M.Y. Bakhmutov V.I. Belikov V.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). TPL R100T also produced stable quinonoid intermediates upon addition of these amino acids. However, with TPL R100T/V283R no detectable quinonoid adduct was observed in the presence of any amino acid including l-tyrosine. TPL R100T/V283R and TPL R100T were tested for β-elimination activity towardl-tyrosine and dicarboxylic amino acids of various lengths (Table I). The k cat value of TPL R100T/V283R toward l-tyrosine was decreased 30-fold as compared with wild-type TPL without significant change in the K mvalue. When TPL R100T/V283R was tested for activity toward dicarboxylic amino acids using the coupled assay with lactate dehydrogenase and NADH, pyruvate was detected in the reaction mixtures. Thin layer chromatographic analyses confirmed the production of pyruvate. A yellow spot, the R f value of which was the same as that of authentic pyruvate, was detected on the plate as the unique and invariable oxo acid product of the enzymic reactions with all dicarboxylic substrates. No 2-oxobutyric acid, which possibly might have been produced by a γ-elimination reaction ofl-glutamate, was detected. The expected products of the β-elimination reaction of the dicarboxylic substrates l-aspartate,l-glutamate, and l-2-aminoadipate are pyruvate, ammonia, and the monocarboxylic acids formate, acetate, and propionate, respectively. In the case of l-aspartate, formate was identified and determined using the coupled assay with formate dehydrogenase and NAD+. Equimolar amounts of pyruvate and formate were detected (Table II). Thus, TPL R100T/V283R catalyzes, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme, the β-elimination reaction of dicarboxylic substrates at least as efficiently or, in the case of l-aspartate, even two times faster than that of l-tyrosine (k cat= 0.21 s−1; Table I). The K m value of TPL R100T/V283R for the β-elimination reaction withl-glutamate was significantly lower than theK m values with l-aspartate andl-2-aminoadipate. It seems that l-glutamate has the optimum size for binding among these dicarboxylic substrates. TPL R100T also catalyzed the β-elimination reaction of the dicarboxylic amino acids l-aspartate, l-glutamate, andl-2-aminoadipate; however, the reaction was up to six times slower than that with the double mutant enzyme. TheK m values were also higher (up to 3 times, in the case of l-glutamate) as compared with the double mutant enzyme. Furthermore, the TPL R100T-catalyzed β-elimination reaction of l-tyrosine was five times faster than the TPL R100T/V283R-catalyzed reaction.Table IIStoichiometry of the β-elimination reaction of tyrosine phenol-lyase R100T/V283R with l-aspartateTime of reactionProductsPyruvateaPyruvate was measured using the coupled a"

Currently, two major classes of anti-AIDS chemotherapeutic drugs have been developed that target the enzyme: the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NIs), which are chain-terminating nucleoside analogs, and the non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs), which are chemically and structurally diverse and appear to inhibit HIV-1 RT by binding to a common site distinct from the binding site of the nucleoside compounds (for a review, see Refs. 1De Clercq E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar and 2Arnold E. Das K. Ding J. Yadav P.N. Hsiou Y. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Drug Design Discov. 1996; 13: 29-47PubMed Google Scholar).Recently, it has been shown that heme (iron protoporphyrin IX) has an additive effect on murine hematopoietic recovery after treatment with the nucleoside analog AZT-TP (3Harrison J. Kappas A. Levere R.D. Lutton J.D. Chertkov J.L. Jiang S. Abraham N.G. Blood. 1993; 82: 3574-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, heme and certain other metalloporphyrins stimulate the immune system and enhance erythropoiesis (4Abraham N.G. Blood Rev. 1991; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Weiss G. Lutton J.D. Fuchs D. Werner-Felmayer G. Bock G. Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Levere R.D. Wachter H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol.

Heme, as well as the synthetic heme analog tin protoporphyrin, significantly enhances bone marrow erythroid progenitor proliferation and differentiation in lymphoproliferative disorders (6Lutton J.D. Chertkov J.L. Levere R.D. Abraham N.G. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1991; 5: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that heme and other synthetic heme analogs significantly inhibit HIV-1 RT activity in a noncompetitive manner with respect to deoxythymidine triphosphate and markedly enhance the inhibitory effect of AZT-TP on HIV-1 RT (7Staudinger R. Abraham N.G. Levere R.D. Kappas A. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1996; 108: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar). We have extended these studies and demonstrated that heme and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs in a concentration-dependent manner, using in vitroRT inhibition assays. Furthermore, these metalloporphyrins, in combination with other nucleoside (AZT-TP) and non-nucleoside (BHAP) HIV-1 RT inhibitors, exert an additive effect on HIV-1 RT inhibition, indicating an independent mode of action by binding to a distinct inhibition site. We thus used a novel approach to investigate the sites on HIV RT and eventually other proteins that might be the target of heme binding and modulation. In recent years, random peptide libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage M13 have been used successfully for the identification of peptide ligands that interact with molecular targets. Phage libraries have been generated to display peptides of variable lengths ranging from 6 to 38 random amino acids, protein fragments, or fully active folded proteins (for a review, see Ref. 8Daniels D.A.

Sequence determination of the displayed peptides, found to be specific for heme, revealed that they lack amino acid sequence similarity, yet are highly enriched in Trp and Tyr residues and have homology to a wide variety of proteins. Among the different Trp-rich peptides displayed by heme-selected clones, one in particular was found to be partially homologous to sequence 398–407 from the connection domain of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs as well as SIV RT, suggesting that this sequence corresponds to the distinct binding site for heme and a site for inhibition of enzyme activity. Intrinsic fluorescence assays indicated that heme and ZnPP bind to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the exact sequence 398–407 of HIV-1 RT as well as to intact dimeric HIV-1 RT. We have also demonstrated the ability of synthetic peptide 398–407 to reverse the inhibitory effect of both metalloporphyrins on HIV-1 RT activity. Molecular modeling indicated that sequence 398–407 from the connection subdomain of HIV-1 RT is sufficiently exposed to accommodate heme binding. These studies have thus identified a new site for inhibition on HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs that facilitates the design and preparation of new porphyrin-based inhibitors of RT that may have clinical potential in the management of AIDS.DISCUSSIONAt present, RT represents one of the major targets in the development of chemotherapeutic drugs against HIV, the etiologic agent responsible for the development of AIDS. Inhibitors that have already been developed can be divided into nucleoside analogs that are active in the triphosphorylated form and non-nucleosides that interact directly with RT (1De Clercq E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Arnold E. Das K. Ding J. Yadav P.N. Hsiou Y. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Drug Design Discov. 1996; 13: 29-47PubMed Google Scholar). There have also been attempts to develop other classes of RT inhibitors, such as antisense RNA and sense oligonucleotides (38Goodchild J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13080-13083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that exert an inhibitory effect by interfering with the dimerization process of RT.Metalloporphyrins have been shown to represent potent non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 RT and viral replication. In a recent study, noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-1 RT activity with respect to the nucleoside-binding site was demonstrated (7Staudinger R. Abraham N.G. Levere R.D. Kappas A. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1996; 108: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a distinct but allosterically linked binding site for heme and its analogs as compared with that for AZT. In the present work, we have further investigated the mode of heme and ZnPP inhibition of HIV-1 RT. Using in vitro RT inhibition assays, we have shown that metalloporphyrins, in combination with the well characterized NNI, BHAP, inhibit the enzyme in a noncompetitive and nonexclusive manner and enhance the inhibitory effect of BHAP by wielding an additive effect on the enzyme inhibition, which indicates that heme and its analogs inhibit HIV-1 RT by binding to a distinct site as compared with the common binding site of NNIs.To investigate the sites on HIV-1 RT that might be the target of heme binding, we screened a phage peptide library against heme and isolated heme-specific peptides that were highly enriched in Trp and Tyr residues, indicating that these residues are important for heme binding. It is well documented that the specific structure of heme enables this small molecule to interact with proteins and peptides in various ways. The fifth and sixth coordination sites of the iron can ligand with various amino acids, whereas the propionyl and vinyl side chains of the tetrapyrrole ring are able to interact with appropriate amino acids via ionic and hydrophobic interactions, respectively (45Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). We believe that the high frequency of Trp and Tyr residues in the peptides identified by phage display arises due to the interaction of the Trp and Tyr residues in the heme-specific displayed peptides with the heme molecule via π-π aromatic stacking. Nevertheless, comparison of our heme-specific peptide sequences with those in protein sequence data bases revealed complete or partial homology between almost all of our peptide sequences and a large number of different protein sequences, including known heme-binding proteins. It was also not surprising that we found a match between one clone, A-7, and the highly conserved sequence 398–407 from the connection domain of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV RTs, indicating that this region corresponds to the binding site for heme and for other heme analogs on RT. It should be noted that the identification of a ligand-binding site in a protein by random peptide libraries is not unprecedented. Similar studies have described the isolation of phage-displayed peptides specific for different proteinaceous targets, which led to the identification of ligand-binding sites in proteins known to interact with those targets (46Lauvrak V. Brekke O.H. Ihle O. Lindqvist B.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 47Adey N.B. Kay B.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).This paper also provides the first demonstration that heme and its synthetic analog, ZnPP, are potent inhibitors of HIV-2 RT, thus strongly supporting our suggestion that metalloporphyrins inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 (and perhaps SIV) RTs by binding to region 398–407 from the connection domain of the enzymes, which is conserved between these species. The ability of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the exact sequence 398–407 of HIV-1 RT to reverse the inhibitory effect of both heme and ZnPP on HIV-1 RT activity is consistent with our findings. Intrinsic fluorescence assays also indicated that metalloporphyrins bind to the HIV-1 RT synthetic peptide 398–407, although with much lower affinity than to intact dimeric enzyme. In addition, sedimentation equilibrium measurements by analytical ultracentrifugation also demonstrated that heme binds to the dimeric form of RT, which argues against a mechanism for heme inhibition in which porphyrin promotes dissociation of the RT dimer. Support of our suggestion that metalloporphyrins inhibit RT from HIV-1 and HIV-2, by binding to region 398–407 from the connection domain of the enzymes, is provided by the finding that heme does not inhibit RT from feline immunodeficiency virus, where region 398–407 (WESNLINSPY) (48Olmsted R.A. Hirsch V.M. Purcell R.H. Johnson P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8088-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) from the connection domain of the enzyme is dissimilar to that of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. 2S. Le Grice, personal communication. As indicated by molecular modeling, the highly conserved sequence 398–407 from the connection domain of HIV-1 RT is sufficiently exposed to provide surfaces of appropriate size for heme binding (Figs. 3 and4). There are several possible modes for heme binding to the RT heterodimer. Heme may bind to sequence 398–407 either at the front or back of the p66 or p51 connection domain at either exposed site. Alternatively, it may bind to both subunits on a larger site including surface residues not identified by the phage-displayed peptide library, such as Trp410, which is also highly exposed and links the p66 and p51 peptide sites on the back of the molecule (Fig.3 B). Only one of these four potential heme-binding sites could obviously interfere with RT enzyme activity. This is the p51 front exposed surface shown in Fig. 3 A, in which Trp398, Glu399, Thr400, and Trp402 are partially exposed. Given that α-helix L of the p51 subunit has been shown to make contact with the primer strand (37Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), binding to this site could interfere with the binding of the primer-template. If the region shown in Fig. 3 A is indeed the heme-binding site, then this is a rare example of a site of inhibition in the p51 monomer of RT. To our knowledge, the only other residue in the p51 monomer implicated in a site of inhibition is Glu138, which may be involved in inhibition by NNIs (49Jonckheere H. Taymans J.-M. Balzarini J. Velazquez S. Camarasa M.-J. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Anne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25255-25258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme binding to the other three sites, however, could only inhibit RT activity by indirectly disturbing the conformation of the molecule in the active-site region.The mechanism of heme inhibition clearly merits further study. The identification, here, of a possible site or sites of inhibition will facilitate this process. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate single or extended amino acid substitutions within the coding region of HIV-1 RT, with specific emphasis on region 398–407 from the connection subdomains of the enzyme, will facilitate the determination of the mechanism of heme binding to HIV-1 RT and its inhibitory effect on the enzyme. In addition, p66 and/or p51 could be subjected to subunit-specific mutagenesis to distinguish which of the four possible heme-binding sites on RT (Fig. 3, A and B) are sites of inhibition. This work demonstrates that heme and ZnPP are indeed true HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT inhibitors by binding to a distinct binding site on the enzyme and encourages the design and preparation of a new class of porphyrin-based systems that will have a more potent inhibitory effect on HIV-1 RT, especially in soluble forms.

Currently, two major classes of anti-AIDS chemotherapeutic drugs have been developed that target the enzyme: the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NIs), which are chain-terminating nucleoside analogs, and the non-nucleoside inhibitors (NNIs), which are chemically and structurally diverse and appear to inhibit HIV-1 RT by binding to a common site distinct from the binding site of the nucleoside compounds (for a review, see Refs. 1De Clercq E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar and 2Arnold E. Das K. Ding J. Yadav P.N. Hsiou Y. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Drug Design Discov. 1996; 13: 29-47PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that heme (iron protoporphyrin IX) has an additive effect on murine hematopoietic recovery after treatment with the nucleoside analog AZT-TP (3Harrison J. Kappas A. Levere R.D. Lutton J.D. Chertkov J.L. Jiang S. Abraham N.G. Blood. 1993; 82: 3574-3579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, heme and certain other metalloporphyrins stimulate the immune system and enhance erythropoiesis (4Abraham N.G. Blood Rev. 1991; 5: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Weiss G. Lutton J.D. Fuchs D. Werner-Felmayer G. Bock G. Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Levere R.D. Wachter H. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1993; 202: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Heme, as well as the synthetic heme analog tin protoporphyrin, significantly enhances bone marrow erythroid progenitor proliferation and differentiation in lymphoproliferative disorders (6Lutton J.D. Chertkov J.L. Levere R.D. Abraham N.G. Leuk. Lymphoma. 1991; 5: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that heme and other synthetic heme analogs significantly inhibit HIV-1 RT activity in a noncompetitive manner with respect to deoxythymidine triphosphate and markedly enhance the inhibitory effect of AZT-TP on HIV-1 RT (7Staudinger R. Abraham N.G. Levere R.D. Kappas A. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1996; 108: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar). We have extended these studies and demonstrated that heme and zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPP) inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs in a concentration-dependent manner, using in vitroRT inhibition assays. Furthermore, these metalloporphyrins, in combination with other nucleoside (AZT-TP) and non-nucleoside (BHAP) HIV-1 RT inhibitors, exert an additive effect on HIV-1 RT inhibition, indicating an independent mode of action by binding to a distinct inhibition site. We thus used a novel approach to investigate the sites on HIV RT and eventually other proteins that might be the target of heme binding and modulation. In recent years, random peptide libraries displayed on the surface of filamentous bacteriophage M13 have been used successfully for the identification of peptide ligands that interact with molecular targets. Phage libraries have been generated to display peptides of variable lengths ranging from 6 to 38 random amino acids, protein fragments, or fully active folded proteins (for a review, see Ref. 8Daniels D.A. Lane D.P. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 1996; 9: 494-507Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Such libraries have been used to identify peptide epitopes for monoclonal (9Scott J.J. Smith G.P.

Science. 1990; 249: 404-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar), and others). Here we report the use of a 12-amino acid residue random peptide library displayed on bacteriophage M13 to identify peptide ligands that interact with heme. Sequence determination of the displayed peptides, found to be specific for heme, revealed that they lack amino acid sequence similarity, yet are highly enriched in Trp and Tyr residues and have homology to a wide variety of proteins. Among the different Trp-rich peptides displayed by heme-selected clones, one in particular was found to be partially homologous to sequence 398–407 from the connection domain of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs as well as SIV RT, suggesting that this sequence corresponds to the distinct binding site for heme and a site for inhibition of enzyme activity. Intrinsic fluorescence assays indicated that heme and ZnPP bind to a synthetic peptide corresponding to the exact sequence 398–407 of HIV-1 RT as well as to intact dimeric HIV-1 RT. We have also demonstrated the ability of synthetic peptide 398–407 to reverse the inhibitory effect of both metalloporphyrins on HIV-1 RT activity. Molecular modeling indicated that sequence 398–407 from the connection subdomain of HIV-1 RT is sufficiently exposed to accommodate heme binding. These studies have thus identified a new site for inhibition on HIV-1 and HIV-2 RTs that facilitates the design and preparation of new porphyrin-based inhibitors of RT that may have clinical potential in the management of AIDS. DISCUSSIONAt present, RT represents one of the major targets in the development of chemotherapeutic drugs against HIV, the etiologic agent responsible for the development of AIDS. Inhibitors that have already been developed can be divided into nucleoside analogs that are active in the triphosphorylated form and non-nucleosides that interact directly with RT (1De Clercq E. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1992; 8: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Arnold E. Das K. Ding J. Yadav P.N. Hsiou Y. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Drug Design Discov. 1996; 13: 29-47PubMed Google Scholar). There have also been attempts to develop other classes of RT inhibitors, such as antisense RNA and sense oligonucleotides (38Goodchild J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13080-13083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that exert an inhibitory effect by interfering with the dimerization process of RT.Metalloporphyrins have been shown to represent potent non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 RT and viral replication. In a recent study, noncompetitive inhibition of HIV-1 RT activity with respect to the nucleoside-binding site was demonstrated (7Staudinger R. Abraham N.G. Levere R.D. Kappas A. Proc. Assoc. Am. Phys. 1996; 108: 47-54PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a distinct but allosterically linked binding site for heme and its analogs as compared with that for AZT. In the present work, we have further investigated the mode of heme and ZnPP inhibition of HIV-1 RT. Using in vitro RT inhibition assays, we have shown that metalloporphyrins, in combination with the well characterized NNI, BHAP, inhibit the enzyme in a noncompetitive and nonexclusive manner and enhance the inhibitory effect of BHAP by wielding an additive effect on the enzyme inhibition, which indicates that heme and its analogs inhibit HIV-1 RT by binding to a distinct site as compared with the common binding site of NNIs.To investigate the sites on HIV-1 RT that might be the target of heme binding, we screened a phage peptide library against heme and isolated heme-specific peptides that were highly enriched in Trp and Tyr residues, indicating that these residues are important for heme binding. It is well documented that the specific structure of heme enables this small molecule to interact with proteins and peptides in various ways. The fifth and sixth coordination sites of the iron can ligand with various amino acids, whereas the propionyl and vinyl side chains of the tetrapyrrole ring are able to interact with appropriate amino acids via ionic and hydrophobic interactions, respectively (45Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990Crossref Google Scholar). We believe that the high frequency of Trp and Tyr residues in the peptides identified by phage display arises due to the interaction of the Trp and Tyr residues in the heme-specific displayed peptides with the heme molecule via π-π aromatic stacking. Nevertheless, comparison of our heme-specific peptide sequences with those in protein sequence data bases revealed complete or partial homology between almost all of our peptide sequences and a large number of different protein sequences, including known heme-binding proteins. It was also not surprising that we found a match between one clone, A-7, and the highly conserved sequence 398–407 from the connection domain of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV RTs, indicating that this region corresponds to the binding site for heme and for other heme analogs on RT. It should be noted that the identification of a ligand-binding site in a protein by random peptide libraries is not unprecedented. Similar studies have described the isolation of phage-displayed peptides specific for different proteinaceous targets, which led to the identification of ligand-binding sites in proteins known to interact with those targets (46Lauvrak V. Brekke O.H. Ihle O. Lindqvist B.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1997; 378: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 47Adey N.B. Kay B.K. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 523-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).This paper also provides the first demonstration that heme and its synthetic analog, ZnPP, are potent inhibitors of HIV-2 RT, thus strongly supporting our suggestion that metalloporphyrins inhibit both HIV-1 and HIV-2 (and perhaps SIV) RTs by binding to region 398–407 from the connection domain of the enzymes, which is conserved between these species. The ability of a synthetic peptide corresponding to the exact sequence 398–407 of HIV-1 RT to reverse the inhibitory effect of both heme and ZnPP on HIV-1 RT activity is consistent with our findings. Intrinsic fluorescence assays also indicated that metalloporphyrins bind to the HIV-1 RT synthetic peptide 398–407, although with much lower affinity than to intact dimeric enzyme. In addition, sedimentation equilibrium measurements by analytical ultracentrifugation also demonstrated that heme binds to the dimeric form of RT, which argues against a mechanism for heme inhibition in which porphyrin promotes dissociation of the RT dimer. Support of our suggestion that metalloporphyrins inhibit RT from HIV-1 and HIV-2, by binding to region 398–407 from the connection domain of the enzymes, is provided by the finding that heme does not inhibit RT from feline immunodeficiency virus, where region 398–407 (WESNLINSPY) (48Olmsted R.A. Hirsch V.M. Purcell R.H. Johnson P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8088-8092Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) from the connection domain of the enzyme is dissimilar to that of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV. 2S. Le Grice, personal communication. As indicated by molecular modeling, the highly conserved sequence 398–407 from the connection domain of HIV-1 RT is sufficiently exposed to provide surfaces of appropriate size for heme binding (Figs. 3 and4). There are several possible modes for heme binding to the RT heterodimer. Heme may bind to sequence 398–407 either at the front or back of the p66 or p51 connection domain at either exposed site. Alternatively, it may bind to both subunits on a larger site including surface residues not identified by the phage-displayed peptide library, such as Trp410, which is also highly exposed and links the p66 and p51 peptide sites on the back of the molecule (Fig.3 B). Only one of these four potential heme-binding sites could obviously interfere with RT enzyme activity. This is the p51 front exposed surface shown in Fig. 3 A, in which Trp398, Glu399, Thr400, and Trp402 are partially exposed. Given that α-helix L of the p51 subunit has been shown to make contact with the primer strand (37Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L. Kamer G. Ferris A.L. Clark P. Hizi A. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6320-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar), binding to this site could interfere with the binding of the primer-template. If the region shown in Fig. 3 A is indeed the heme-binding site, then this is a rare example of a site of inhibition in the p51 monomer of RT. To our knowledge, the only other residue in the p51 monomer implicated in a site of inhibition is Glu138, which may be involved in inhibition by NNIs (49Jonckheere H. Taymans J.-M. Balzarini J. Velazquez S. Camarasa M.-J. Desmyter J. De Clercq E. Anne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25255-25258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme binding to the other three sites, however, could only inhibit RT activity by indirectly disturbing the conformation of the molecule in the active-site region.The mechanism of heme inhibition clearly merits further study. The identification, here, of a possible site or sites of inhibition will facilitate this process. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate single or extended amino acid substitutions within the coding region of HIV-1 RT, with specific emphasis on region 398–407 from the connection subdomains of the enzyme, will facilitate the determination of the mechanism of heme binding to HIV-1 RT and its inhibitory effect on the enzyme. In addition, p66 and/or p51 could be subjected to subunit-specific mutagenesis to distinguish which of the four possible heme-binding sites on RT (Fig. 3, A and B) are sites of inhibition. This work demonstrates that heme and ZnPP are indeed true HIV-1 and HIV-2 RT inhibitors by binding to a distinct binding site on the enzyme and encourages the design and preparation of a new class of porphyrin-based systems that will have a more potent inhibitory effect on HIV-1 RT, especially in soluble forms.

https://openalex.org/W2160899789,"MN12H2 is a bactericidal antibody directed against outer membrane protein PorA epitope P1.16 of Neisseria meningitidis. Binding of MN12H2 to PorA at the meningococcal surface activates the classical complement pathway resulting in bacterial lysis. We have determined the crystal structure of the unliganded MN12H2 Fab fragment in two different crystal forms and compared it with the structure of the Fab in complex with a P1.16-derived peptide. The unliganded Fabs have elbow bend angles of 155° and 159°, whereas the liganded Fab has a more closed elbow bend of 143°. Substantial differences in quaternary and tertiary structure of the antigen binding site are observed between the unliganded and liganded MN12H2 Fab structures that can be attributed to peptide binding. The variable light and heavy chain interface of the liganded Fab is twisted by a 5° rotation along an axis approximately perpendicular to the plane of the interface. Hypervariable loops H1, H2, and framework loop FR-H3 follow this rotation. The hypervariable loop H3 undergoes conformational changes but remains closely linked to hypervariable loop L1. In contrast with the binding site expansion seen in other Fab-peptide structures, the MN12H2 binding site is narrowed upon peptide binding due to the formation of a “false floor” mediated by arginine residue 101 of the light chain. These results indicate that PorA epitope P1.16 of N. meningitidis is recognized by the complement-activating antibody MN12H2 through induced fit, allowing the formation of a highly complementary immune complex.

The unliganded Fabs have elbow bend angles of 155° and 159°, whereas the liganded Fab has a more closed elbow bend of 143°. Substantial differences in quaternary and tertiary structure of the antigen binding site are observed between the unliganded and liganded MN12H2 Fab structures that can be attributed to peptide binding. The variable light and heavy chain interface of the liganded Fab is twisted by a 5° rotation along an axis approximately perpendicular to the plane of the interface. Hypervariable loops H1, H2, and framework loop FR-H3 follow this rotation. The hypervariable loop H3 undergoes conformational changes but remains closely linked to hypervariable loop L1. In contrast with the binding site expansion seen in other Fab-peptide structures, the MN12H2 binding site is narrowed upon peptide binding due to the formation of a “false floor” mediated by arginine residue 101 of the light chain. These results indicate that PorA epitope P1.16 of N. meningitidis is recognized by the complement-activating antibody MN12H2 through induced fit, allowing the formation of a highly complementary immune complex. Antibody-antigen recognition is considered one of the most specific intermolecular interactions in the immune system. In addition to their antigen binding specificity, antibodies display a variety of secondary biological activities that are critical for host defense. These include virus neutralization, complement activation, opsonization, and signal transduction. Structural aspects of these antibody-associated effector functions have been described for virus-neutralizing antibodies (1Rini J.M. Schulze-Gahmen U. Wilson I.A.

The atomic details of the complexes between the Fab fragments of anti-viral antibodies and peptides derived from viral epitopes show common structural features: 1) binding of the peptides induces major rearrangements of the antibody variable domains, and 2) the epitope-peptides bind in tight turn conformations. For a bacterial epitope, we have recently found that it was bound in a similar manner by complement-activating antibody MN12H2, directed against outer membrane protein PorA of Neisseria meningitidis (5van den Elsen J.M.H. Herron J.N. Hoogerhout P. Poolman J.T. Boel E. Logtenberg T. Wilting J. Crommelin D.J.A. Kroon J. Gros P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).PorA is a cation-selective transmembrane protein of 44 kDa that forms trimeric pores in the meningococcal outer membrane. According to a topology model, based on known porin structures, the protein is thought to span the membrane in a 16-strand β-barrel conformation (6van der Ley P. Heckels J.E. Virji J. Hoogerhout P. Poolman J.T. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2963-2971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The model predicts eight extended extracellular loops. Two of these surface exposed loops (loops 1 and 4) are highly immunogenic and evoke antibodies that induce complement mediated bacterial killing. MN12H2 is a bactericidal antibody that is elicited against loop 4 of PorA. The recognition of loop 4 epitope P1.16 by MN12H2 is used as a model for studying the molecular and structural details of bactericidal antibody recognition of PorA.The first three-dimensional details of the bactericidal recognition of PorA epitope P1.16 were unveiled in the crystal structure of the MN12H2 Fab fragment in complex with a peptide derived from PorA residues 180–187 (5van den Elsen J.M.H. Herron J.N. Hoogerhout P. Poolman J.T. Boel E. Logtenberg T. Wilting J. Crommelin D.J.A. Kroon J. Gros P. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The fluorescein-labeled peptide was found in a type I β-turn conformation in the antigen binding cavity. The structure revealed several hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between both binding partners, including a salt bridge between aspartate 182P of PorA and MN12H2 light chain residue histidine 31L. 1Amino acid residues of the MN12H2 heavy chain and light chain are indicated by H and L, respectively.

With the results from a thermodynamic study, this salt bridge was identified as the key interaction explaining the increased incidence of meningitis in United Kingdom in the early 1980s, caused by a D182N mutant strain of N. meningitidis (7van den Elsen J.M.H. van Pomeren E.

In clinical vaccination trials with outer membrane vesicles, it was shown that PorA was critical for the induction of bactericidal antibodies in humans (9Rouppe van der Voort E. van der Ley P. van der Biezen J. George S. Tunnella O. van Dijken H. Kuipers B. Poolman J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2745-2751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that the presence of these antibodies correlate with protection against meningococcal disease (10Milagres L.G. Ramos S.R. Sacchi C.T. Melles C.E. Vieira V.S. Sat H. Brito G.S. Moraes J.C. Frash C.E. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 4419-4424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protective activity of the immune complex between an antigen and a bactericidal antibody depends on its ability to cross-link complement factor C1q. With the binding of C1q, the classical complement pathway is activated, which leads to the formation of a multiprotein membrane-attack complex, causing bacterial membrane rupture.Here, we present the three-dimensional structure of the unliganded MN12H2 Fab fragment at 2.5 Å resolution based on two different crystal forms and compare it with the Fab-P1.16 peptide complex. With both structures available, we examine possible mechanisms by which quaternary and tertiary changes following antigen binding may activate the classical complement pathway.DISCUSSIONComparison of two crystal forms of the unliganded MN12H2 Fab with the liganded structure of the epitope-peptide Fab complex reveals significant conformational changes. The surface representations of the binding sites of both structures in Fig. 4 indicate the quaternary and tertiary changes of the Fab upon peptide binding. The antigen binding site of MN12H2 may be thought of as a left-handed baseball glove, with hypervariable loops L1 and L3 forming the thumb, and the VHdomain (with loops H3, H2, and H1) as the fingers. As in the baseball glove, the thumb (loop L1) and the forefinger (loop H3) remain connected upon peptide binding through a “two-bar” web formed by a tandem of tyrosine-aspartate interactions, whereas the other fingers (loops H2, framework region-H3, and H1) follow the shape of the peptide (see also Fig. 2). In the unliganded Fab, arginine residue 101L forms a positively charged bulge in the binding cavity. Upon peptide binding, this bulge is depressed, and its charge is neutralized due to the formation of a false floor that narrows the cavity and connects four hypervariable loops (L1, L3, H1, and H3). The side chain rearrangements in the H3 loop represented by tyrosines 100H and 103H are necessary to clear the binding site to further accommodate the peptide binding. When the P1.16 peptide is positioned in the binding site of the unliganded Fab, the side chain of these residues sterically blocks the binding of the peptide.The sterical hindrance of hypervariable loop H1 residues that is encountered by the peptide is overcome by the observed 5° twist of the VL-VH interface in the liganded Fab. This rotation brings H1 residue Tyr-33H in position to form a hydrophobic stack with peptide residue Thr-183P. The VL-VHtwist also decreases the distance between the Cα atoms of hypervariable loops L1 (Arg-101L) and H3 (Ser-97H) from 13 to 11.5 Å, thereby facilitating the formation of a Arg-101L-mediated bidentate hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-97H and the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr-41L. The hydrogen bond between the Nη2 group of Arg-101L and Nδ2 of His-35H (hypervariable loop H2) induces an almost 90° rotation of the 35H imidazolium ring bringing the Nε2 nitrogen in position to fix the peptide backbone at the newly formed cavity floor. The formation of this false floor, directed by Arg-101L, stabilizes the topography of the complexed VL-VH dimer by locking four hypervariable loops (L1, L3, H1, and H3) into a new conformation. A thermodynamic study on the interaction with MN12H2 and the P1.16 peptide revealed that these interactions, together with the release of structured water from the binding pocket and the newly formed interactions between Fab and peptide, favor the interaction by 100 kJ mol−1 (8van den Elsen J.M.H. van Unen L.M.A. van Bloois L. Busquets M.A. Jiskoot W. Hoogerhout P. Wilting J. Herron J.N. Crommelin D.J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12583-12591Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It largely offsets the 50 kJ mol−1 cost in free energy needed to induce the structural changes in both binding partners (as determined by the analysis of Sturtevant (22Sturtevant J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar)).With the exposed guanidinium moiety of Arg-101L in the cavity surrounded by basic residues His-31L and Arg-59L, an overall positively charged binding site is formed in the unliganded Fab, as illustrated in Fig. 4 A. Although Arg-101L does not contribute directly to peptide binding, it could explain the medium-affinity cross-reactive binding mode of MN12H2 for negatively charged self-antigens such as single stranded DNA and cardiolipin. 3J. M. H. van den Elsen, unpublished results. The appearance of basic residues at these sites within the light chain hypervariable loops and especially at the junction between Vκ and Jκ1 genes (101L) fits the general pattern of DNA-binding antibodies described by Radic and Weigert (23Radic M.Z. Weigert M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 487-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Whether the binding of these autoantigens adopt different complexed structures remains to be determined.Relative disposition of VL-VH domains has been observed before in Fab structures upon binding of a peptide (1Rini J.M. Schulze-Gahmen U. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 255: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 24Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 113-118Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar,25Stanfield R.L. Fieser T.M. Lerner R.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1990; 248: 721Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It illustrates the intrinsic flexibility of antibodies in adapting to the shape of an antigen. The largest VL-VHrotations have been observed for anti-DNA Fab BV0–401 (7.5°) (26Herron J.N. He X.M. Ballard D.W. Blier P.R. Pace P.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Voss Jr., E.W. Edmundson A.B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and for anti-HIV Fab 50.1 upon complexation with a V3 loop peptide (16°) (25Stanfield R.L. Fieser T.M. Lerner R.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1990; 248: 721Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Unlike MN12H2, these Fab structures show a large decrease in the number of VL-VH interface contacts upon complexation with their antigen. The loss of self-contacts is mainly ascribed to rearrangements of the H3 loop, which moves out of the binding site with root mean square deviations in backbone atoms up to 5 Å. In contrast with this binding site expansion, the MN12H2 Fab shows a closer association of both domains upon peptide binding by forming a false floor. The 5° rotation of the H1 and H2 loop narrows the cavity even more and holds the peptide in a tight lock. Because the backbone of the H3 loop remains fixed, massive side-chain rearrangements of tyrosines 100H and 103H are essential for the binding site to adapt to the shape of the peptide.All of the structural changes mentioned in this section appear to be necessary for peptide binding. Because both monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal forms of the unliganded Fab display similar features in a different crystal packing environment, the conformational differences with the liganded Fab are believed to be peptide-induced. No conformational changes of fluorescein binding residue Arg-59H have been detected between the unliganded Fabs and 1MPA, suggesting no or only minor effects of the fluorescein molecule on the shaping of the binding site.Conformational changes in the elbow bend angle and the distal extremities of the constant region, such as the interchain disulfide region, are believed to be induced by the general flexibility of these regions and by their different crystal packing interactions. The elbow bend regions at the junction between the variable and constant domains are very flexible and there have been differences found in the elbow bend angle between unliganded structures as well as liganded structures of the same Fab (27Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Stanfield et al. (25Stanfield R.L. Fieser T.M. Lerner R.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1990; 248: 721Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) even reported a 13° difference in elbow bend angle between two complexed 50.1 Fab molecules found in the same asymmetric unit, also illustrating this general flexibility.There is no evidence that the peptide-induced conformational changes, other than adjusting fit and complementarity to the antigen, provide a signal that is transmitted to the constant domains triggering secondary biological activities. The accessibility and the tight-turn recognition motif of immunogenic loops might be important for evoking antibodies that are able to neutralize viral infections or activate the complement system. Several mechanisms have been postulated for virus neutralizing activities of antibodies, including interference with the viral attachment to the cell and viral internalization, induction of structural changes as a consequence of binding, and intracapsid cross-linking, preventing uncoating of the virus (28Tormo J. Centeno N.B. Fontana E. Bubendorfer T. Fita I. Blaas D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A mechanism for the complement activating capacity of bactericidal antibody MN12H2 may be the improved complementarity between the P1.16 epitope and the binding site. This tight conformational state might decrease the off-rate of the complex, thereby augmenting the effective antibody valence on the bacterial surface for cross-linking C1q. Antibody-antigen recognition is considered one of the most specific intermolecular interactions in the immune system. In addition to their antigen binding specificity, antibodies display a variety of secondary biological activities that are critical for host defense. These include virus neutralization, complement activation, opsonization, and signal transduction.

Science. 1990; 248: 721Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) even reported a 13° difference in elbow bend angle between two complexed 50.1 Fab molecules found in the same asymmetric unit, also illustrating this general flexibility.There is no evidence that the peptide-induced conformational changes, other than adjusting fit and complementarity to the antigen, provide a signal that is transmitted to the constant domains triggering secondary biological activities. The accessibility and the tight-turn recognition motif of immunogenic loops might be important for evoking antibodies that are able to neutralize viral infections or activate the complement system. Several mechanisms have been postulated for virus neutralizing activities of antibodies, including interference with the viral attachment to the cell and viral internalization, induction of structural changes as a consequence of binding, and intracapsid cross-linking, preventing uncoating of the virus (28Tormo J. Centeno N.B. Fontana E. Bubendorfer T. Fita I. Blaas D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A mechanism for the complement activating capacity of bactericidal antibody MN12H2 may be the improved complementarity between the P1.16 epitope and the binding site. This tight conformational state might decrease the off-rate of the complex, thereby augmenting the effective antibody valence on the bacterial surface for cross-linking C1q. Comparison of two crystal forms of the unliganded MN12H2 Fab with the liganded structure of the epitope-peptide Fab complex reveals significant conformational changes. The surface representations of the binding sites of both structures in Fig. 4 indicate the quaternary and tertiary changes of the Fab upon peptide binding. The antigen binding site of MN12H2 may be thought of as a left-handed baseball glove, with hypervariable loops L1 and L3 forming the thumb, and the VHdomain (with loops H3, H2, and H1) as the fingers. As in the baseball glove, the thumb (loop L1) and the forefinger (loop H3) remain connected upon peptide binding through a “two-bar” web formed by a tandem of tyrosine-aspartate interactions, whereas the other fingers (loops H2, framework region-H3, and H1) follow the shape of the peptide (see also Fig. 2). In the unliganded Fab, arginine residue 101L forms a positively charged bulge in the binding cavity. Upon peptide binding, this bulge is depressed, and its charge is neutralized due to the formation of a false floor that narrows the cavity and connects four hypervariable loops (L1, L3, H1, and H3). The side chain rearrangements in the H3 loop represented by tyrosines 100H and 103H are necessary to clear the binding site to further accommodate the peptide binding. When the P1.16 peptide is positioned in the binding site of the unliganded Fab, the side chain of these residues sterically blocks the binding of the peptide. The sterical hindrance of hypervariable loop H1 residues that is encountered by the peptide is overcome by the observed 5° twist of the VL-VH interface in the liganded Fab. This rotation brings H1 residue Tyr-33H in position to form a hydrophobic stack with peptide residue Thr-183P. The VL-VHtwist also decreases the distance between the Cα atoms of hypervariable loops L1 (Arg-101L) and H3 (Ser-97H) from 13 to 11.5 Å, thereby facilitating the formation of a Arg-101L-mediated bidentate hydrogen bond with the side chain hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-97H and the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr-41L. The hydrogen bond between the Nη2 group of Arg-101L and Nδ2 of His-35H (hypervariable loop H2) induces an almost 90° rotation of the 35H imidazolium ring bringing the Nε2 nitrogen in position to fix the peptide backbone at the newly formed cavity floor. The formation of this false floor, directed by Arg-101L, stabilizes the topography of the complexed VL-VH dimer by locking four hypervariable loops (L1, L3, H1, and H3) into a new conformation. A thermodynamic study on the interaction with MN12H2 and the P1.16 peptide revealed that these interactions, together with the release of structured water from the binding pocket and the newly formed interactions between Fab and peptide, favor the interaction by 100 kJ mol−1 (8van den Elsen J.M.H. van Unen L.M.A. van Bloois L. Busquets M.A. Jiskoot W. Hoogerhout P. Wilting J. Herron J.N. Crommelin D.J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12583-12591Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It largely offsets the 50 kJ mol−1 cost in free energy needed to induce the structural changes in both binding partners (as determined by the analysis of Sturtevant (22Sturtevant J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar)). With the exposed guanidinium moiety of Arg-101L in the cavity surrounded by basic residues His-31L and Arg-59L, an overall positively charged binding site is formed in the unliganded Fab, as illustrated in Fig. 4 A. Although Arg-101L does not contribute directly to peptide binding, it could explain the medium-affinity cross-reactive binding mode of MN12H2 for negatively charged self-antigens such as single stranded DNA and cardiolipin. 3J. M. H. van den Elsen, unpublished results. The appearance of basic residues at these sites within the light chain hypervariable loops and especially at the junction between Vκ and Jκ1 genes (101L) fits the general pattern of DNA-binding antibodies described by Radic and Weigert (23Radic M.Z. Weigert M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 487-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Whether the binding of these autoantigens adopt different complexed structures remains to be determined. Relative disposition of VL-VH domains has been observed before in Fab structures upon binding of a peptide (1Rini J.M. Schulze-Gahmen U. Wilson I.A. Science. 1992; 255: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 24Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 113-118Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar,25Stanfield R.L. Fieser T.M. Lerner R.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1990; 248: 721Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). It illustrates the intrinsic flexibility of antibodies in adapting to the shape of an antigen. The largest VL-VHrotations have been observed for anti-DNA Fab BV0–401 (7.5°) (26Herron J.N. He X.M. Ballard D.W. Blier P.R. Pace P.E. Bothwell A.L.M. Voss Jr., E.W. Edmundson A.B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and for anti-HIV Fab 50.1 upon complexation with a V3 loop peptide (16°) (25Stanfield R.L. Fieser T.M. Lerner R.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1990; 248: 721Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Unlike MN12H2, these Fab structures show a large decrease in the number of VL-VH interface contacts upon complexation with their antigen. The loss of self-contacts is mainly ascribed to rearrangements of the H3 loop, which moves out of the binding site with root mean square deviations in backbone atoms up to 5 Å. In contrast with this binding site expansion, the MN12H2 Fab shows a closer association of both domains upon peptide binding by forming a false floor. The 5° rotation of the H1 and H2 loop narrows the cavity even more and holds the peptide in a tight lock. Because the backbone of the H3 loop remains fixed, massive side-chain rearrangements of tyrosines 100H and 103H are essential for the binding site to adapt to the shape of the peptide. All of the structural changes mentioned in this section appear to be necessary for peptide binding. Because both monoclinic and orthorhombic crystal forms of the unliganded Fab display similar features in a different crystal packing environment, the conformational differences with the liganded Fab are believed to be peptide-induced. No conformational changes of fluorescein binding residue Arg-59H have been detected between the unliganded Fabs and 1MPA, suggesting no or only minor effects of the fluorescein molecule on the shaping of the binding site. Conformational changes in the elbow bend angle and the distal extremities of the constant region, such as the interchain disulfide region, are believed to be induced by the general flexibility of these regions and by their different crystal packing interactions. The elbow bend regions at the junction between the variable and constant domains are very flexible and there have been differences found in the elbow bend angle between unliganded structures as well as liganded structures of the same Fab (27Wilson I.A. Stanfield R.L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 857-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Stanfield et al. (25Stanfield R.L. Fieser T.M. Lerner R.A. Wilson I.A. Science. 1990; 248: 721Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) even reported a 13° difference in elbow bend angle between two complexed 50.1 Fab molecules found in the same asymmetric unit, also illustrating this general flexibility. There is no evidence that the peptide-induced conformational changes, other than adjusting fit and complementarity to the antigen, provide a signal that is transmitted to the constant domains triggering secondary biological activities.

A mechanism for the complement activating capacity of bactericidal antibody MN12H2 may be the improved complementarity between the P1.16 epitope and the binding site. This tight conformational state might decrease the off-rate of the complex, thereby augmenting the effective antibody valence on the bacterial surface for cross-linking C1q.

CD45 modulates the activity of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases involved at the onset of antigen receptor-mediated signaling by dephosphorylating their regulatory tyrosyl residues. We have shown that lymphocyte responses to antigen receptor stimulation are impaired in CD45-AP-null mice. To examine the possibility that CD45-AP coordinates the interaction between CD45 and its substrates, we investigated the associations of CD45-AP with several protein-tyrosine kinases. Endogenous CD45-AP coimmunoprecipitated with Lck and ZAP-70 in both CD45-positive T cells and their CD45-negative variants after stimulation by antigen receptor ligation. Concomitantly, CD45 coimmunoprecipitated with Lck and ZAP-70 after T cell receptor-mediated stimulation of CD45-positive cells. Recombinant CD45-AP exhibited specific binding to Lck and ZAP-70 protein-tyrosine kinases, but not to Fyn or Csk, in lysates of both CD45-positive and –negative T cells. Specific interactions were demonstrated between the respective recombinant proteins as well. These results demonstrate that CD45-AP associates directly and selectively with Lck and ZAP-70 in response to T cell receptor-mediated stimulation. The associations of CD45-AP with Lck and ZAP-70 may mediate the functional interactions of these kinases with CD45 during antigen receptor stimulation.

Protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity residing in the cytoplasmic portion of CD45 (1Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Diltz C.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins by these protein-tyrosine kinases is one of the earliest events of TCR signaling (8Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 9Mustelin T. Immunity. 1994; 1: 351-356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 10Rudd C.E. Janssen O.

There is strong evidence supporting the notion that CD45 activates Src family protein-tyrosine kinases by dephosphorylating their down-regulatory tyrosine residues (2Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 11Mustelin T. Coggeshall K.M. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, considerable data indicate that the effect of CD45 on antigen receptor-mediated signaling can be inhibitory rather than stimulatory under certain circumstances. For example, CD45 has been shown to specifically interact with and dephosphorylate the tyrosine-phosphorylated ζ chain of the TCR (15Furukawa T. Itoh M. Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10928-10932Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Since the tyrosine-phosphorylated ζ chain recruits Syk family protein-tyrosine kinases for TCR-mediated signal amplification (3Chan A.C. Irving B. Fraser J.D. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9166-9170Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 4Chan A.C. van Oers N.S.C. Tran A. Turka L. Law C.-L. Ryan J.C. Clark E.A. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4758-4766PubMed Google Scholar), dephosphorylation of the ζ chain by CD45 will diminish the stimulatory signal. In addition, it has been suggested that CD45 directly or indirectly inactivates ZAP-70 by dephosphorylating its key tyrosyl residues (16Mustelin T. Williams S. Tailor P. Couture C. Zenner G. Burn P. Ashwell J.D. Altman A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that CD45 can down-regulate Lck by dephosphorylating its up-regulatory tyrosyl residue in some cells (17D'Oro U. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Ashwell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4996-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). It remains unknown whether CD45 indeed exercises both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on lymphocyte signaling and, if so, how these opposing activities of CD45 are regulated. Most of the CD45 in lymphocytes is associated with a predominantly lymphocyte-specific protein, CD45-associated protein (CD45-AP), with an estimated stoichiometry of 1 to 1 (18Takeda A. Wu J.J. Maizel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16651-16659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol.

Expression of CD45-AP is limited to certain subsets of leukocytes, whereas CD45 is expressed in all subsets of leukocytes. CD45-AP is expressed strongly in T, preB, and B cells, very weakly in mast cells, and not at all in plasma cells or cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (20Kitamura K. Matsuda A. Motoya S. Takeda A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A human homologue of CD45-AP, named LPAP, is also expressed in comparable subsets of leukocytes (21Schraven B. Schoenhaut D. Bruyns E. Koretzky G. Eckerskorn C. Wallich R. Kirchgessner H. Sakorafas P. Labkovsky B. Ratnofsky S. Meuer S. J. Biol.

Ikeda K. Monden T. Kishimoto T. Am. J. Hematol. 1997; 54: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Two forms of CD45-AP mRNA exist, and the resulting two CD45-AP proteins are identical in their capacity for specific binding to CD45 but employ different mechanisms for endoplasmic reticulum membrane translocation (20Kitamura K. Matsuda A. Motoya S. Takeda A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The potential transmembrane segment of CD45-AP binds specifically to the transmembrane segment of CD45, and this physical association does not require the presence of other leukocyte-specific proteins, such as Lck, Fyn, and ZAP-70 (23Kitamura K. Maiti A. Ng D.H.W. Johnson P. Maizel A.L. Takeda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21151-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence analysis and protease susceptibility analysis of CD45-AP indicate that only a short segment at the amino terminus of CD45-AP protrudes extracellularly, whereas the bulk of the protein is located intracellularly (23Kitamura K. Maiti A. Ng D.H.W. Johnson P. Maizel A.L. Takeda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21151-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that CD45-AP plays an adapter-like role for CD45 (19Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence in support of this hypothesis was provided recently by investigation of CD45-AP-null mice created by gene targeting (24Matsuda A. Motoya S. Kimura S. McInnis R. Maizel A.L. Takeda A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1863-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CD45-AP-null mice do not exhibit any detectable abnormality in lymphocyte differentiation in contrast to CD45-deficient (25Kishihara K. Penninger J. Wallace V.A. Kundig T.M. Kawai K. Wakeham A.

Howlett S. Smith A.J.H. May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) mice that show a profound block in T cell differentiation. However, similar to CD45-deficient or -null mice, responses of CD45-AP-null mice to TCR-mediated or B cell receptor-mediated stimuli are markedly reduced (24Matsuda A. Motoya S. Kimura S. McInnis R. Maizel A.L. Takeda A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1863-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction between CD45 and Lck is significantly decreased in CD45-AP-null T cells, indicating that CD45-AP directly or indirectly mediates the interaction of CD45 with Lck. Therefore, the present study was carried out to examine the possibility that CD45-AP specifically interacts with potential CD45 substrates. Specific interactions of CD45-AP with Lck and ZAP-70, but not with Fyn or Csk, were detected in both CD45-positive T cells and their CD45-negative variants in response to TCR ligation. Moreover, a specific association of CD45-AP with Lck and ZAP-70 was demonstrated by using the respective recombinant proteins. In CD45-positive cells, TCR ligation resulted in association of CD45 with Lck and ZAP-70. These results demonstrate that direct and specific interactions of CD45-AP with Lck and ZAP-70 are triggered by TCR ligation and support the notion that CD45-AP plays an adapter-like role by coordinating the interaction between CD45 and specific protein-tyrosine kinases. The mouse T cell line YAC-1 (WT) and its CD45-negative variant (N1) (27Volarevic S. Niklinska B.B. Burns C.M. Yamada H. June C.H. Dumont F.J. Ashwell J.D. J. Exp.

Following the addition of anti-hamster IgG (12.5 μg/ml), cells were further incubated either on ice for 60 min for negative controls or at 37 °C for 5 or 60 min for stimulation. After a wash in cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed at 20 × 106 cells/ml in 0.8% polyoxyethylene 10 oleyl ether (BRIJ 96) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm thioglycolic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 μm phenylarsine oxide, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. Postnuclear supernatants of the lysates were used for binding assays and immunoprecipitations as described below.

Marth, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, and I. Trowbridge, The Salk Institute, San Diego, CA), Fyn (Oncogene Research Products and Transduction Laboratories), Lck (Transduction Laboratories and Upstate Biotechnology Incorporated), ZAP-70 (Transduction Laboratories), or Csk (Transduction Laboratories) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated protein A, anti-mouse Ig antibody, or anti-rat Ig antibody. The signals were detected with either the ECL Western blotting system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or Supersignal substrate system (Pierce) and quantitated by densitometric analysis (Scan Analysis version 2.56 by Biosoft). The CD45-AP cDNA (19Takeda A. Maizel A.L. Kitamura K. Ohta T. Kimura S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2357-2360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen) downstream from six histidine residues using the KpnI site. Mouse ZAP-70 cDNA (provided by Dr. A. Weiss, University of California, San Francisco) (4Chan A.C. van Oers N.S.C. Tran A. Turka L. Law C.-L. Ryan J.C. Clark E.A. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4758-4766PubMed Google Scholar) was excised byXhoI and subcloned into the pQE32 expression vector (Qiagen) downstream from six histidine residues at the BamHI sites by using a BamHI linker. The respective histidine-tagged recombinant proteins were produced in the JM109 strain ofEscherichia coli by isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside induction and purified by binding to nickel-nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen). GST-tagged recombinant Lck, produced by an expression construct (a mouse Lck cDNA subcloned into pGEM-2T expression vector; provided by Dr. P. Johnson, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) (31Ng D.H.W. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1295-1300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. GST-tagged recombinant CD45-AP has been described before (23Kitamura K. Maiti A. Ng D.H.W. Johnson P. Maizel A.L. Takeda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21151-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GST-tagged Lck eluted from glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads was incubated with various amounts of GST-tagged CD45-AP eluate at 37 °C for 30 min prior to addition of histidine-tagged CD45-AP bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetate beads and further incubation at 37 °C for 1 h for binding. Likewise, histidine-tagged ZAP-70 eluted from nickel-nitrilotriacetate beads was incubated with various amounts of histidine-tagged CD45-AP eluate prior to addition of GST-tagged CD45-AP bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads and further incubation at 37 °C for 1 h for binding. Binding reactions were carried out in 0.4% BRIJ 96, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm thioglycolic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mg/ml ovalbumin. GST or histidine tags without a fusion partner were isolated in the same way as described above for fusion proteins and were used as negative controls for competition experiments. Material bound to the beads was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. Sucrose gradients containing 0.4% BRIJ 96, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm thioglycolic acid, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 μmphenylarsine oxide, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate were prepared in a polyallomer tube (14 × 95 mm) from 5.6 ml each of 2.5 and 12.5% sucrose solutions over a 0.25-ml cushion of 40% sucrose solution. Cell lysate (0.5 ml) obtained from 25 × 106CD45-positive YAC-1 cells was applied to the top of the gradient. After centrifugation at 36,000 rpm for 20 h at 4 °C in an SW40 swinging bucket rotor (L8–80 m Beckman ultracentrifuge), the sucrose gradient was fractionated into 20 equal portions from the bottom of the tube. A portion of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting. The earliest stages of TCR signaling are mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases such as Lck, Fyn, ZAP-70, and Syk (8Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev.

Lck and Fyn are most likely in vivo substrates of CD45, whereas ZAP-70 may also be regulated directly or indirectly by CD45 (2Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev.

To examine the possibility that CD45-AP directs the interaction between CD45 and its substrates, the interactions of recombinant CD45-AP with several protein-tyrosine kinases were investigated. Wild-type CD45-positive YAC-1 cells (WT) and their CD45-negative variant cells (N1) (27Volarevic S. Niklinska B.B. Burns C.M. Yamada H. June C.H. Dumont F.J. Ashwell J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) were stimulated by TCR cross-linking with anti-CD3 ε antibody (28Leo O. Foo M. Sachs D.H. Samelson L.E. Bluestone J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1374-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), and cell lysates were prepared at various time points after stimulation. Whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-CD45, Fyn, Lck, ZAP-70, or Csk antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 A, there is no detectable CD45 in N1 cells. The absence of CD45 in N1 cells was also confirmed by Northern hybridization (20Kitamura K. Matsuda A. Motoya S. Takeda A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), anti-CD45 immunoprecipitation combined with Western blotting, and flow cytometry (data not shown). The wild-type and variant cells expressed comparable amounts of Fyn, Lck, ZAP-70, and Csk, and the amounts remained unchanged by stimulation. Syk is not expressed in YAC-1 cells (not shown). Immunoblotting with anti-ZAP-70 antibody detected two bands with different mobilities as has been reported previously by others (32Duplay P. Thome M. Herve F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1163-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The structural difference between these two bands is not known. However, the fast-migrating band indicated by the arrowappears to represent the subpopulation that interacts with CD45-AP and CD45 as described below. For binding assays, either full-length recombinant CD45-AP (F) or the bulk of its cytoplasmic portion (C) (Fig. 1 B) bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were incubated with the same cell lysates. Material bound to the beads was analyzed by Western blotting with the aforementioned antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1 C, binding of CD45 to recombinant CD45-AP remained unchanged with stimulation. As expected from the fact that CD45 and CD45-AP interact through their respective transmembrane segments (23Kitamura K. Maiti A. Ng D.H.W. Johnson P. Maizel A.L. Takeda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21151-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), no CD45 bound to the C form of CD45-AP. Lck and ZAP-70 specifically bound to recombinant CD45-AP, and specificity of the binding was demonstrated by the fact that Fyn, Csk (Fig. 1 C), and other proteins such as Grb2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase-1C (not shown) did not bind to CD45-AP under the same conditions. Interestingly, binding of Lck and ZAP-70 to CD45-AP did not require the presence of CD45 since it occurred in CD45-negative variant cells as well. Furthermore, the binding of Lck and ZAP-70 to CD45-AP decreased for both the wild-type lymphocytes and their CD45-negative variants when cells were stimulated by TCR ligation although the total amounts of these protein-tyrosine kinases in the cell lysates remained unchanged (see Fig. 1 A). The greater decrease of bound Lck in WT cells compared with that seen in N1 was not a consistent observation as N1 cells exhibited greater decreases in some experiments. Lck and ZAP-70 did not associate with the C form of CD45-AP indicating that the transmembrane and/or the first five amino acid residues of the cytoplasmic domain play critical roles for their interactions. In addition, the binding of Lck and ZAP-70 to CD45-AP occurred independently of the TCR coreceptor, CD4, since the cell lines used did not express CD4 on their cell surfaces (27Volarevic S. Niklinska B.B. Burns C.M. Yamada H. June C.H. Dumont F.J. Ashwell J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 835-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The percentage of endogenous Lck and ZAP-70 that is capable of binding to recombinant CD45-AP was then determined by using cell lysates obtained from unstimulated CD45-positive YAC-1 cells (WT) and CD45-negative N1 cells. The cell lysates were repeatedly subjected to fresh aliquots of recombinant CD45-AP-conjugated beads, and the material bound to each aliquot of beads was analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-Lck or anti-ZAP-70 antibody (Fig.1 D). Approximately 2.1% of total Lck and 0.95% of total ZAP-70 present in WT cells bound to recombinant CD45-AP. On the other hand, approximately 0.84% of total Lck and 0.66% of total ZAP-70 present in N1 cells bound to CD45-AP. Next, we analyzed the effect of anti-CD3 ε stimulation on associations between endogenous CD45-AP and Lck or ZAP-70 in wild-type CD45-positive YAC-1 cells (WT) and their CD45-negative variant cells (N1). Anti-CD45-AP immunoprecipitates were prepared at various time points after stimulation, and material coimmunoprecipitated with CD45-AP or with control beads was analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against Lck or ZAP-70 (Fig.2). Lck and ZAP-70 coimmunoprecipitated with CD45-AP after stimulation both in WT and N1 cells. In agreement with the results of recombinant CD45-AP binding analysis (Fig.1 C), association of Lck or ZAP-70 with endogenous CD45-AP did not require the presence of CD45 since it occurred in CD45-negative variant cells as well. Larger amounts of Lck and ZAP-70 coimmunoprecipitated with CD45-AP in N1 than in WT cells despite the greatly diminished presence of CD45-AP in N1 compared with WT cells (20Kitamura K. Matsuda A. Motoya S. Takeda A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding of Lck and ZAP-70 to recombinant CD45-AP decreased with stimulation (Fig. 1 C), whereas association of endogenous CD45-AP with these protein-tyrosine kinases increased (Fig.2). This indicates that after 60 min stimulation, the protein-tyrosine kinase populations available for binding to CD45-AP have already bound to endogenous CD45-AP and are not available for binding to recombinant CD45-AP. We have further investigated the association of CD45-AP with Lck and ZAP-70 by binding analysis employing recombinant forms of each protein. As shown in Fig.3 A, GST-tagged recombinant Lck protein bound to histidine-tagged recombinant CD45-AP that was conjugated to the nickel-nitrilotriacetate beads, and the binding was prevented by adding increasing amounts of free GST-tagged CD45-AP as a competitor for binding. An excess amount of control GST protein did not compete for the binding. Likewise, as shown in Fig. 3 B, histidine-tagged recombinant ZAP-70 protein bound to GST-tagged recombinant CD45-AP that was conjugated to the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and the binding was prevented by adding increasing amounts of free histidine-tagged CD45-AP as a competitor for binding. An excess amount of control histidine-tag protein did not compete for the binding. The results demonstrate that both Lck and ZAP-70 recombinant proteins bind specifically to recombinant CD45-AP and that the interactions do not require other lymphocyte-specific proteins. Direct associations have been observed between CD45 and Lck (31Ng D.H.W. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Johnson P. J. Biol.

We herein report cloning of the β5 integrin gene promoter and identification of a GM-CSF-responsive sequence. A 13-kilobase (kb) genomic fragment containing part of the β5 gene was isolated by screening a mouse genomic library with a probe derived from the most 5′-end of a murine β5 cDNA. A combination of primer extension and S1 nuclease studies identifies two transcriptional start sites, with the major one designated +1. A 1-kb subclone containing sequence −875 to + 110 is transcriptionally active in a murine myeloid cell line. This 1-kb fragment contains consensus binding sequences for basal (Sp1), lineage-specific (PU.1), and regulatable (signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription factors. Reflecting our earlier findings, promoter activity is repressed in transfected myeloid cells treated with GM-CSF. Using deletion mutants, we localized a 109-base pair (bp) promoter region responsible for GM-CSF-inhibited β5 transcription. We further identified a 19-bp sequence within the 109-bp region that binds GM-CSF-induced nuclear proteins by gel shift/competition assays. Mutation of the 19-bp sequence not only ablates its capacity to bind nuclear proteins from GM-CSF-treated cells, in vitro, but the same mutation, when introduced in the 1-kb promoter, abolishes its ability to respond to GM-CSF treatment. Northern analysis demonstrates that cycloheximide treatment abrogates the capacity of GM-CSF to decrease β5 mRNA levels. In summary, we have identified a 19-bp cis-element mediating GM-CSF-induced down-regulation of β5 by a mechanism requiring protein synthesis.

The osteoclast is a physiological polykaryon, related to, but distinct from, foreign body giant cells (1Glowacki J. Jasty M. Goldring S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1986; 1: 327-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Both multinucleated cells are derived by fusion of macrophages in a process apparently requiring attachment of the mononuclear precursors to matrix (2Baron R. Neff L. Tran Van P. Nefussi J.R. Vignery A. Am. J. Pathol. 1986; 122: 363-378PubMed Google Scholar, 3Fallon M.D. Teitelbaum S.L. Kahn A.J. Lab. Invest. 1983; 49: 159-164PubMed Google Scholar). Cell-matrix interactions are mediated by several classes of receptors, including the family of heterodimers known as integrins (4Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar, 5Albelda S.M. Buck C.A.

Biochem. 1995; 59: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the integrin αvβ5, although closely related to αvβ3 in structure and sharing many of the same target ligands (4Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar), is not expressed on mature bone resorbing cells (11Shinar D.M. Schmidt A. Halperin D. Rodan G.A. Weinreb M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 403-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that murine osteoclast precursors initially express and utilize the integrin αvβ5 and not αvβ3 for attachment to matrix (12Inoue M. Namba N. Chappel J. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In this circumstance, αvβ3 and αvβ5 levels rise and fall, respectively, during formation of bone-resorbing polykaryons. The reciprocal changes in the two functional integrins are replicated by treating osteoclast precursors with GM-CSF, 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; UTR, untranslated region; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; BMM, bone marrow macrophage; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; UTR, untranslated region; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); FBS, fetal bovine serum; β-gal, β-galactosidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; UTR, untranslated region; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; BMM, bone marrow macrophage; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; UTR, untranslated region; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); FBS, fetal bovine serum; β-gal, β-galactosidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. a cytokine that is important for osteoclastogenesis (13Suda T.

Reflecting their surface heterodimers, β5 and β3mRNAs fall and rise, respectively, in response to GM-CSF, whereas those of αv are unaltered. GM-CSF-mediated inhibition of β5 expression reflects decreased transcriptional activity of the β5 gene (12Inoue M. Namba N. Chappel J. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In order to study the molecular mechanism by which integrin β5 gene is regulated by the cytokine, we have isolated a β5 integrin genomic fragment containing the transcriptional start sites and a portion of the regulatory domain of the gene. We demonstrate that the cloned sequence exhibits promoter activity and responds to GM-CSF in the same manner as the intact promoter in osteoclast precursors. Finally, we identify a 19-bp sequence within the β5 promoter that mediates the GM-CSF responsiveness of this gene. This sequence does not contain consensus sequences for any transcription factor known to be regulated by GM-CSF and, as such, represents a novel GM-CSF response element. Human β5 integrin cDNA (provided by Dr. Eric Brown, Washington University School of Medicine) was labeled with digoxigenin to screen a 5′-stretch mouse kidney cDNA library (CLONTECH), and three clones were isolated and sequenced by dideoxynucleotide chain termination (16Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar). Because none contained a translational start site, the most 5′ sequence available was used to screen a mouse brain cDNA library by the GeneTrapper Screening Method (Life Technologies, Inc.). Several new clones were isolated and completely sequenced. A mouse genomic library in FIX II vector (Stratagene) was screened with a 230-bp digoxigenin-labeled fragment derived from the most 5′-end of the longest cDNA clone. One positive clone, identified after examining 500,000 plaques, was purified by secondary and tertiary screenings. Phage DNA was prepared from the clone and was digested with NotI, resulting in two DNA fragments of 4 and 9 kb. Both fragments were subcloned into a pBluescript plasmid. Southern blot analysis showed that the 9-kb fragment positively reacted with the 230-bp probe derived from the most 5′-end of the longest cDNA clone. Primer extension was performed using total RNA prepared from mouse osteoclast precursors (bone marrow macrophages) and a 30-mer oligonucleotide complementary to a sequence 23 bp downstream of the 5′-end of the longest cDNA clone (Fig. 1). Excess oligonucleotide, end-labeled with [32P]ATP, was hybridized for 90 min at 65 °C with total RNA (previously denatured for 5 min at 95 °C). Annealed primer was extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 60 min. The reaction product was treated with DNase-free RNase at 37 °C for 15 min to remove the RNA templates, and the resulting mixture was separated on a denaturing gel, with an unrelated and previously defined marker to establish the size of specific bands. S1 nuclease experiments were performed using total RNA prepared from mouse bone marrow macrophages and a single-stranded 70-mer oligonucleotide comprising a sequence complementary to the first 44 bases of the 5′-end of the longest cDNA clone, the contiguous 16-base genomic sequence immediately upstream of the 5′-end of the longest clone, and a 10-base nonspecific sequence (as a control for nuclease activity; see Fig. 3 B). The oligonucleotide, end-labeled with [32P]ATP, was mixed with excess total RNA, and the mixture was denatured at 75 °C for 10 min and then incubated overnight at 55 °C. The annealed oligonucleotide was treated with S1 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) at 37 °C for 60 min, and the resulting products were separated on a denaturing sequencing gel, using an unrelated and previously defined marker to establish the size of specific bands. Sequence analysis indicates that there is a AccI site in the 5′-UTR of the full-length clone. A 30-mer oligo complementary to a sequence upstream of theAccI site was synthesized and end-labeled with digoxigenin. The 9-kb genomic fragment was digested with AccI, and the products were separated in an agarose gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and hybridized with the 30-mer probe. A 1-kb fragment from the digestion reacted with the probe. Based on our screening strategy, this 1-kb fragment, which should contain the transcriptional start site, was subcloned into pGL3-basic plasmid containing the luciferase reporter gene, to construct a reporter plasmid named pGL3–1kb(+). A control reporter plasmid, pGL3–1kb(−), was also obtained by placing the 1-kb β5 promoter fragment in antisense orientation in front of the luciferase gene. Deletion mutants of the 1-kb fragment were made by using the exonuclease III/mung bean nuclease kit from Stratagene. The presence of two unique restriction sites in the multiple cloning sites region, one generating a 3′-overhang (KpnI) and another generating a 5′-overhang (Mlu I), made it possible to use this method. Following religation, the sizes of all mutants were determined by sequencing, using a common primer derived from vector sequence. The series of mutants generated in this manner is as follows: pGL3(−796), with a sequence from −796 to +110; pGL3(−726), from −726 to +110; pGL3(−633), from −633 to +110; pGL3(−483), from −483 to +110; pGL3(−340), from −340 to +110; pGL3(−172), from −172 to +110; pGL3(−63), from −63 to +110; pGL3(−28), from −28 to +110; and pGL3(+10), from +10 to +110. FDC-P1/MAC11 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with 5% WEHI cell conditioned medium as a source of interleukin-3. Prior to transfection, cells were counted and spun down at 1400 ×g for 7 min. The medium was then removed, and cells were resuspended in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 8.75 × 106 cells/ml. Four hundred microliters of this cell suspension were transiently transfected, by electroporation at 325 V and 950 microfarads in Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) in a 0.4-cm Gene Pulser cuvette, with 20 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of CMV-β-gal as a control plasmid for transfection efficiency. Transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS with 5% WEHI cell conditioned medium in 6-well tissue culture dishes for 16 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activities were measured using the luciferase assay kits from Promega, with normalization to β-gal activities measured separately. In experiments utilizing GM-CSF treatment, FDC-P1/MAC11 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% FBS with 5 ng/ml recombinant mouse (R & D Systems). When cell density reached 5 × 105/ml, recombinant mouse GM-CSF (R & D Systems) was added to the cell culture at 10 ng/ml. For controls, PBS containing 0.1% BSA was used. After 24 h, cells were counted and spun down at 1400 × g for 7 min. The culturing medium was then removed and saved, and the cells were resuspended in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a concentration of 12.5 × 106cells/ml. 0.4 ml of this cell suspension was transiently cotransfected by electroporation at 325 V and 950 microfarads in Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) in a 0.4-cm Gene Pulser cuvette, with 20 μg of reporter plasmid and 0.5 μg of CMV-β-gal as a control plasmid for transfection efficiency. The transfected cells were grown in 6-well tissue culture dishes with 3 ml of the saved culturing medium per well for 16 h. Luciferase and β-gal activities were measured as described previously. Nuclear extracts for EMSAs were prepared as follows. Bone marrow macrophages were isolated and cultured in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS with daily supply of recombinant mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R & D Systems; 10 ng/ml) for 2 days in 150-mm Petri dishes (1 × 107 cells were plated in one dish). Then, the cells were treated with mouse recombinant GM-CSF (R & D Systems) for 48 h. For controls, PBS containing 0.1% BSA was used. The cells were washed three times with cold PBS and incubated with 20 ml of PBS containing 5 mm EDTA and 5 mmEGTA for 30 min on ice. Cells from two plates were scraped with rubber policemen, pooled, spun down, resuspended in 1.5 ml of cold PBS, and transferred to 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes. The cells were pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 30 s, media were removed and the cells were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; dithiothreitol and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were added freshly). Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice, at which time 32 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 were added to the suspension, followed by vortexing of the tube for 15 s and incubating on ice for 10 min. Nuclei were spun down and resuspended in 100 μl of nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, and leupeptin were added freshly to the buffer. The extract was kept for 20 min on ice and spun down in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant (nuclear extract) was aliquoted, quickly frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −70 °C. Protein concentration of nuclear extracts was determined using the Micro BCA kit (Pierce). All oligos used for gel shift assays were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Oligos were end-labeled with 32P by T4 polynucleotide kinase (Life Technologies, Inc.). 1 × 105 cpm of probe were incubated with 2 μg of nuclear extracts in a 20-μl volume of binding reaction (10 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 ng/ml poly(dI-dC)) on ice for 30 min. In competition experiments, different amounts of cold competitors were premixed with equal counts of hot probe before being added to the binding mixture. The binding mixture was separated at 300 V for 3.5 h by 4% high ionic strength native polyacryamide gel with an acrylamide:bis ratio of 80:1 as described (17Chodosh L.A. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.C. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar), using a Hoefer SE 600 series gel unit. The gels were transferred to 3 m blotting paper, dried, and exposed to film with an intensifying screen at −70 °C. The point mutations were introduced in the context of the 1-kb promoter (pGL3–1kb+) using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligos used are 5′-CCCACAAGTGGtTtAGCTGTtAtAGCCACCTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCCAGGTGGCTaTaACAGCTaAaCCACTTGTGGG-3′. Lowercase letters indicate the mutation sites. The oligos were purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PCR was performed in a 50-μl volume withPfu polymerase (Stratagene), 10 ng of pGL3–1kb+ (template), and 125 ng of each oligo under the following conditions: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 30 s; 16 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 12 min; and parking at 4 °C. The PCR was treated with Dpn I (10 units) for 60 min at 37 °C. XL1-Blue supercompetent cells were transformed with the Dpn I-treated PCR mixture as described in the instruction manual and plated on Ampicillin plates. Plasmids were prepared from individual colonies and sequenced to confirm the correctness of the introduced mutations. Mouse bone marrow macrophages were isolated and cultured in minimum Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS with daily supply of recombinant mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor (10 ng/ml; R & D Systems) for 2 days. Cells were treated with recombinant mouse GM-CSF (10 ng/ml; R & D Systems) for 6 h (PBS containing 0.1% BSA was used for the control). Total RNA was prepared from these cells using Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). For cycloheximide treatment experiments, macrophages were treated with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) 30 min after the addition of cycloheximide (5 μg/ml). Cells then were cultured for 6 h before total RNA was isolated. 10 μg of each sample was separated on 1% agarose gel, and Northern analysis was performed using NorthernMax kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). A 1.4-kb mouse β5cDNA fragment was labeled by BrightStar Psoralen-Biotin labeling kit (Ambion) and used as a probe in the Northern analysis (30 ng/ml). The signal was detected using BrightStar nonisotopic detection system (Ambion). The blot was stripped and reprobed with 1.3-kb rat GAPDH probe (30 ng/ml, labeled in the same way as the β5 probe) to normalize loading. To analyze the intensity of each band on the autoradiograms, the x-ray films were subjected to image analysis using ISS SepraScan 2001 (Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA). β5 mRNA levels were normalized to the GAPDH signal. Sequence analysis was performed using the Genetic Computer Group sequence analysis software. Because integrin cDNA sequences are highly conserved across species (18Mimura H. Cao X. Ross F.P. Chiba M. Teitelbaum S.L. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1061-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Ransom D.G. Hens M.D. DeSimone D.W. Dev. Biol. 1993; 160: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we labeled a human β5 cDNA (20McLean J.W. Vestal D.J. Cheresh D.A. Bodary S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17126-17131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Ramaswamy H. Hemler M.E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1561-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Suzuki S. Huang Z. Tanihara H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5354-5358Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and used it as a probe to screen more than 1,000,000 plaques derived from a 5′-stretch mouse kidney cDNA library (CLONTECH), which yielded three positive clones. Phage DNA was prepared, and the inserts were subcloned into pBluescript plasmid. Sequence analysis revealed that all three clones are incomplete, each terminating at +400, based on the human β5 sequence. Because we lacked sequence coding for the 5′-end of the cDNA, we used the GeneTrapper method (Life Technologies, Inc.) to rapidly screen a large number of clones. This approach, using as a probe the 5′ sequence derived from our first round of cloning, resulted in isolation of several new clones, the longest containing 294 bp of the 5′-untranslated region, the entire coding sequence, and 443 bp of the 3′-untranslated region, including a polyadenylation sequence (Fig. 1) (sequence submitted to GenBankTM; accession numberAF022110). The deduced amino acid sequence is more than 90% identical to the human β5 protein (not shown). Primer extension was performed to determine whether the largest β5 cDNA clone contains the complete 5′-untranslated region. The size of oligonucleotide used as primer (30 bp), plus the amount of untranslated sequence 5′ of the ligation site of this primer (23 bp) would predict formation of a product of at least 53 bp (Fig.1). A single band corresponding to a 59-mer oligonucleotide was detected (Fig. 2), indicating that the available β5 cDNA clone lacks 6 bases at its 5′-end. A 230-bp fragment derived from the most 5′-end of this cDNA was labeled and used to screen a mouse genomic library. After screening 500,000 plaques, one positive clone was identified, from which phage DNA was prepared. Restriction digestion analysis reveals the phage contains a 13-kb insert. A restriction map for the 13-kb was created by restriction digestion and Southern analysis (Fig.3 A). Digestion of the phage DNA with NotI yielded two fragments, 4 and 9 kb. Both fragments were subcloned into pBluescript plasmid. By Southern analysis, a probe containing the translational start site hybridized to the 9-kb clone. Sequencing of a portion of this 9-kb fragment, using primers (initially based on one vector arm and subsequently based on generated sequences), provided approximately 1000 bases representing, in the 3′ to 5′ orientation, a 30-bp intron, 70 bp coding for the known 23-amino acid leader sequence, and a portion of the 5′-untranslated region. The combined results yielded a region subsequently identified as the proximal regulatory domain of the β5 integrin gene (see Fig. 3 B). Given the contiguous nature of the regulatory domain, 5′ untranslated region and leader sequences, which end in the canonical AG sequence typical of intron/exon splice boundaries, this genomic fragment contains the first exon, which codes for the entire 5′-UTR and leader peptide, and the first base of the following codon. The size of the first intron, of which we have sequenced only 30 bp, is unknown. To identify the 5′-end of the β5 cDNA we turned to S1 nuclease protection (Fig. 4). Using this technique, two bands were detected, suggesting that this gene may have two transcriptional start sites, a documented feature of TATA-less promoters (23Ziober B.L. Kramer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22915-22922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The more prominent band, corresponding to a transcriptional start site that is 5 bp more upstream than that predicted by primer extension (Figs. 2 and 3 B), identifies a major transcriptional start site, designated +1 (Fig. 3 B). The discrepancy between this result and that obtained by primer extension (Fig. 2) probably reflects secondary structure near the GC-rich transcriptional start site inhibiting primer extension. A 1-kb genomic fragment, derived from the original 9-kb genomic cDNA by restriction digestion and shown, by Southern analysis, to include the 5′-UTR of the β5 cDNA, was subcloned into pGL3-basic, which contains the reporter gene luciferase. The resultant 1-kb plasmid, pGL3–1kb (+), contains 875 bp upstream and 110 bp downstream of the transcriptional start site. The putative 875-bp promoter includes no TATA box, but two Sp1 sites are located at −27 to −18 and −192 to −283. Putative STAT binding sites are found at −528 to −520 and −402 to −393, whereas PU.1 recognition sequences are present at −778 to −773, −772 to −767, −504 to −499, and +68 to +73 (Fig.3 B). To determine whether the cloned region is an active promoter, we transfected FDC-P1/MAC11 cells with either the 1-kb fragment pGL3–1kb(+) or pGL3–1kb(−), in which the same genomic fragment was placed, in the same reporter, in the antisense orientation. As controls, we transfected the promoterless pGL3-basic and pGL3-promoter (SV40 promoter). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-gal content of cell extracts reflecting transfection with CMV-β-gal. As seen in Fig. 5, the 1-kb β5 upstream fragment is transcriptionally active in murine myeloid progenitor cells. To locate the region essential for transcriptional activity, FDC-P1/MAC11 cells were transfected with pGL3-basic, pGL3–1kb(−), pGL3–1kb(+), or a series of nested deletion constructs of the β5 promoter, pGL3(−726),pGL3(−340), pGL3(−172), pGL3(−63), pGL3(−28), and pGL3(+10). The results indicate that basal promoter activity is regulated by a region located between −28 and +10 (Fig. 5), a sequence containing a consensus domain for the basal transcription factor Sp1. Additional sequences may act as modest enhancers (e.g. pGL3(−172)) or silencers (e.g. pGL3(−340)) of basal β5integrin transcription. GM-CSF transcriptionally down-regulates the β5 integrin gene in mouse marrow osteoclast precursors (12Inoue M. Namba N. Chappel J. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Because FDC-P1/MAC11 cells are GM-CSF-responsive (24Gliniak B.C. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 1073-1083Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we transiently transfected this line with pGL3–1kb(+) and CMV-β-gal reporter constructs. Cells were exposed to vehicle or GM-CSF (10 ng/ml for 24 h) prior to transfection. Luciferase assay demonstrates that the 1-kb promoter fragment contains sequences that mediate GM-CSF inhibition of β5 transcription (Fig.6). To further localize the region responsible for GM-CSF-mediated inhibition of β5 integrin gene expression, we repeated our transfection assays, using a series of β5 promoter deletion mutants. Once again cells were treated with vehicle or GM-CSF prior to transfection. Whereas the activity of constructs pGL3(−796), pGL3(−726), pGL3(−633), pGL3(−483), pGL3(−340), and pGL3(−172) is inhibited by GM-CSF, that of the genomic fragment lacking −172 to −63 is not (Fig. 7). Thus, we have identified a 109-bp sequence mediating GM-CSF-dependent repression of the β5 integrin gene. This promoter region (−172 to −63) does not contain the two STAT-like sequences located at −528 to −520 and −402 to −393 (Fig. 3 B). To identify a smaller sequence mediating GM-CSF responsiveness, we synthesized four overlapping oligos (oligo I, II, III, and IV) spanning the previously defined 109-bp region (Fig.8 A). These short DNA fragments were end-labeled with 32P and used for EMSA studies. Nuclear extracts used were prepared from bone marrow macrophages treated for 48 h with GM-CSF (10 ng/ml) or PBS containing 0.1% BSA (as control). GM-CSF treatment did not alter the pattern of proteins binding to oligos I, II and IV (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, oligo III bound different nuclear proteins, derived from cytokine-treated, as compared with control, cells (Fig. 8 B). Thus, untreated extracts, incubated with oligo III, generate a major band (Fig. 8 B, labeled C) and a minor band (labeled B). When proteins from GM-CSF-treated cells were used, band C disappeared, band B increased in intensity, and a prominent new band (labeled A) appeared. This result suggests, but does not prove, that alterations in protein binding by bases within oligo III may mediate the inhibitory effect of GM-CSF on transcription of the β5 gene. To obtain additional information as to the identity of the bases responsible for the specific EMSA patterns seen in Fig. 8, we synthesized 7 deletion mutants of oligo III (Fig. 9 A) and assessed their capacity to compete with labeled oligo III in EMSA (Fig. 9, B and C). When untreated nuclear extracts were used,"

The conserved core structure of a GPI is EtN-P-Man3-GlcN-PI, with the ethanolamine residue being joined via an amide linkage to the α-carboxyl group of the protein's C-terminal residue (6Holder A.A. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 261-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Many anchors have modifications, such as extra sugars or ethanolamine-phosphate groups, linked to the conserved core (7McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 305-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). GPI anchors contain either glycerolipids (diacylglycerol, alkylacylglycerol, or lyso-acylglycerol) or ceramide lipid moieties (7McConville M.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Biochem.

The trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause sleeping sickness in humans and a related disease in cattle. These parasites live extracellularly in their host's bloodstream and they evade the immune response by a process known as antigenic variation. The variant antigen is the GPI-anchored variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), which forms a densely packed coat covering the entire surface of the parasite cell (10Cross G.A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The GPI biosynthetic pathway in Trypanosoma brucei has been elucidated using a cell-free system containing washed trypanosome membranes (11Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T.

In this pathway, N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) is first transferred from UDP-GlcNAc to phosphatidylinositol (PI), forming GlcNAc-PI via a sulfhydryl-dependent GlcNAc transferase (14Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A.J. Masterson W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This species is then de-N-acetylated to form GlcN-PI (15Doering T.L. Masterson W.J.

After ethanolamine-phosphate addition there is a subsequent inositol-deacylation, to form the GPI glycolipid A′ (20Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This species then undergoes a series of fatty acid remodeling reactions, in which the sn-1 and sn-2 fatty acids are removed and replaced with myristate, forming the VSG precursor, glycolipid A (12Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Subsequently, there are myristate exchange reactions which presumably serve as a proofreading mechanism to ensure that myristate is the only fatty acid in the VSG GPI anchor (23Buxbaum L.U. Raper J.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, trypanosomes synthesize much higher levels of GPIs than they need for anchoring VSG (28Masterson W.J.

The experiments reported in this paper describe a novel T. brucei GPI, designated lipid X, which has some properties suggesting that it is an intermediate in GPI breakdown. Trypanosomes (ILTat 1.3) from the buffy coat of infected rat blood (27Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2041-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) were washed twice (1,800 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C) with permeabilization buffer (150 mm sucrose, 20 mm KCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin) and finally resuspended at 6 × 108 cells/ml in permeabilization buffer on ice. Digitonin (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.03% (approximately 50 μg of digitonin/mg protein). This concentration of digitonin had previously been shown to permeabilize the plasma membrane of T. brucei leaving internal organelles intact (31Turrens J.F. Biochem. J. 1989; 259: 363-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 32Clarkson Jr A.B. Bienen E.J. Pollakis G. Grady R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17770-17776PubMed Google Scholar). Following a 1-min incubation on ice, the cells were centrifuged (12,000 × g for 5 min) and then washed with 1.5 ml of permeabilization buffer. The cells were finally resuspended at 6 × 108 cells/ml in permeabilization buffer and stored in 0.5-ml aliquots at −70 °C. Lysates of trypanosomes were prepared and stored as described previously (11Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), except that the incubation with tunicamycin prior to the hypotonic lysis was omitted. [3H]Palmitic acid (9,10-3H, 52 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) was purified from contaminating fatty acids on a high performance thin layer chromatography (TLC)-C18 reverse phase plate (Merck) eluted with methanol/water (9:1, v:v). Approximately 1 mCi of fatty acid was streaked along a line of 1 cm at the plate's origin. After elution, the purified 3H-labeled fatty acids were extracted from scrapings of the plate using methanol/pyridine/water (2:1:1, v:v) with extensive vortexing and sonication. The organic extract was dried under a stream of nitrogen and fatty acids partitioned by the addition of 0.5 ml of water-saturated butan-1-ol and 0.5 ml of butan-1-ol saturated water. After vortexing and centrifugation, the fatty acids were recovered in the upper butan-1-ol phase, which was dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator. The purified fatty acids were resuspended at 1 mCi/ml in 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 120 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ATP, 1 mmCoA, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and incubated with 1 unit/ml of Pseudomonas acyl-CoA synthetase (Sigma) for 45 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated with sufficient chloroform/methanol (2:1, v:v) to yield chloroform/methanol/water (8:4:3, v:v), forming two phases. The lower chloroform-rich phase was washed with an equal volume of aqueous upper phase from a mock 8:4:3 partition. Purified 3H-labeled palmitoyl-CoA, recovered in the combined aqueous phases, was stored at −20 °C and dried into tubes as required. Cell membranes (1.5 × 107 cell equivalents) were suspended in 25 μl of incubation buffer (110 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin) which in some cases was supplemented with CoCl2 or diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). The suspension was added to [3H]palmitoyl-CoA which had been dried in the tube (0.2 μm final concentration) and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.25 ml of water-saturated butan-1-ol and 0.25 ml of butan-1-ol saturated water. After vortexing and centrifugation, the radiolabeled lipids were recovered in the upper butan-1-ol phase, which was dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator and analyzed by TLC. GPI-PLD digests (29Ralton J.E.

Jack bean α-mannosidase (JBAM) digests were performed in 30 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 0.1% sodium taurodeoxycholate containing 0.5 unit of enzyme (Boehringer-Mannheim). All digests were performed for 18 h at 37 °C. Nitrous acid (HONO) deaminations were performed in 50 μl of 50 mmsodium acetate, pH 4.0, 500 mm NaNO2, and 0.01% Zwittergent 3–16 for 3 h at 60 °C (30Güther M.L.S. Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A.J. J.

Alkaline phosphatase digests were performed in 20 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% NP-40 containing 2 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at 37 °C. Lipids after all digestions and treatments were recovered by extracting with water-saturated butan-1-ol as described above. [3H]Myristate-labeled Man3GlcN-PI standard was formed as previously reported (14Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A.J. Masterson W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Milne K.G. Field R.A. Masterson W.J. Cottaz S. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16403-16408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The [3H]myristate-labeled glycolipids A and C standards was formed using the same procedure except the trypanosomes were labeled with [3H]myristate in the absence of phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (11Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). [3H]Myristoyl-glycerol standard was formed from [3H]myristate-labeled glycolipid A. This species was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 0.005 units ofCrotalus adamanteus phospholipase A2in 30 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmCaCl2, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. Glycolipids were recovered by extracting with water-saturated butan-1-ol as described above. The butan-1-ol phase was dried in a Speed-Vac evaporator and the glycolipids were then suspended in 30 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 and digested with 0.15 unit of recombinant GPI-PLC (33Low M.G. Prasad A.R.S. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) for 18 h at 37 °C. [3H]Myristoyl-glycerol was recovered by extracting with water-saturated butan-1-ol as described above. Synthetic 1-d-6-O-(2-amino-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranosyl)-myo-inositol 1-(1,2-di-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycer-3-ylphosphate), referred to herein as GlcN-PI, was synthesized according to Cottaz et al. (34Cottaz S. Brimacombe J.S. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1993; 1: 2945-2951Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GPI samples were applied in 5 μl of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3, v/v) to Silica Gel 60 HPTLC aluminum-backed plates (Merck). Plates were developed in solvents system A, chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3, v/v); B, chloroform, methanol, 1 m acetic acid, water (25:15:4:2, v/v); C, chloroform, methanol, 1 m ammonium acetate, 13m ammonia/water (180:140:9:9:23, v/v). High performance TLC-C18 reverse phase plates, developed in chloroform/methanol/water (5:15:1, v:v), were used to resolve fatty acid methyl esters (35Doering T.L. Pessin M.S. Hoff E.F. Hart G.W. Raben D.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9215-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TLC plates were analyzed by fluorography after spraying with EN3HANCE. Trypanosomes (1 × 1011 cells) were permeabilized with 0.03% digitonin and resuspended in incubation buffer. The suspension was incubated with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (0.2 μm) for 1 min at 37 °C followed by the addition of 10 μm cold palmitoyl-CoA and a further incubation for 1 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50 ml of water-saturated butan-1-ol and the lipids were recovered in the upper butan-1-ol phase, which was dried in a rotary evaporator and fractionated by TLC using solvent system A. The purified lipid X band was further resolved by TLC using solvent system B. Subsequently lipid X was resuspended in 20% propan-1-ol, 10 mm ammonium acetate prior to applying to a reverse phase HPLC column (Kromasil 5 μm C8; 25 cm × 4.6 mm) equilibrated with the same solvent. The column was eluted with a linear gradient to 90% propan-1-ol, 10 mm ammonium acetate over 80 min with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The highly purified lipid X was dried and resuspended in 20% propan-1-ol, 1 mm ammonium acetate prior to applying to a microbore reverse phase HPLC column (Kromasil 5 μm C8; 5 cm × 0.5 mm) equilibrated with the same solvent. This column was connected online to a Micromass Quattro electrospray mass spectrometer to acquire negative-ion mass spectra over the range m/z 600–1600. The column was eluted with a linear gradient to 90% propan-1-ol, 1 mm ammonium acetate over 50 min with a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The electrospray source conditions were optimized using synthetic GlcN-PI. Scans were averaged and processed using MassLynx software. The initial indication of the existence of lipid X came when we incubated trypanosomes permeabilized with 0.03% digitonin with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA. TLC analysis of the extracted radiolabeled lipids revealed a novel species, designated lipid X, in addition to free fatty acids and phospholipids. Lipid X had an R F slightly higher than that of a glycolipid C standard (Fig. 1, lane 1) (glycolipid C is a free GPI with an acylated inositol (25Krakow J.L. Hereld D. Bangs J.D. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12147-12153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. Ferguson M.A.J. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6164-6173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Lipid X was labeled in only trace amounts in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2 (Fig. 1, lane 2), but production was greatly stimulated by chelation of the Mg2+with EDTA (Fig. 1, lane 3). It was detected at low levels if Mg2+ was excluded from the reaction mixture (Fig. 1,lane 4), but a substantial stimulation in formation of lipid X was obtained in the presence of 1 mm CoCl2(Fig. 1, lane 5). This stimulation with Co2+ was almost completely reversed by the addition of EDTA (Fig. 1, lane 6). We obtained essentially similar results using washed trypanosome membranes obtained from osmotically lysed cells. Using standard cell-free system conditions previously optimized for GPI biosynthesis (11Masterson W.J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1989; 56: 793-800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (containing 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2), we observed no labeling of lipid X with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 1, lane 7). However, when 3 mm MgCl2 provided the only divalent cation, barely detectable amounts of lipid X were formed (Fig.1, lane 8) which could be more easily visualized upon longer exposures (data not shown). As with the digitonin-permeabilized cells, production of lipid X was further enhanced by chelating the MgCl2 with EDTA (Fig. 1, lane 9) or by excluding it from the reaction mixture (Fig. 1, lane 10). As with the permeabilized cells CoCl2 (1 mm) had an even greater stimulatory effect (Fig. 1, lane 11). In the following paragraphs we shall demonstrate that lipid X is a novel GPI. Because there is little if any, of this species produced in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2 (the standard conditions for GPI biosynthesis in the cell-free system), it had not been detected in previous studies. Surprisingly, lipid X is labeled to a 2-fold higher level in digitonin permeabilized cells than in washed membranes. This finding contrasts strikingly with the labeling of GPIs by radiolabeled UDP-GlcNAc and GDP-Man; in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, GPIs are labeled approximately 20 times more efficiently in the cell-free system than in permeabilized cells (data not shown). Because of the more efficient labeling of lipid X, we used permeabilized cells for the rest of the experiments in this paper. It was surprising that lipid X labeled strongly with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA, as other trypanosome GPIs only label efficiently with [3H]myristate, either by a fatty acid remodeling (27Mayor S. Menon A.K. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6174-6181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by an exchange (23Buxbaum L.U. Raper J. Opperdoes F.R. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30212-30220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) pathway. We therefore tested [3H]myristoyl-CoA, [3H]palmitoyl-CoA, and [3H]stearoyl-CoA for their ability to label lipid X in digitonin-permeabilized trypanosomes (the incubation buffer had no added divalent cations). We found that lipid X was not labeled with [3H]myristoyl-CoA or [3H]stearoyl-CoA (Fig.2, lanes 1 and 5, respectively) but that small amounts of this lipid were produced with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 2, lane 3). The labeling of lipid X by all three fatty acyl-CoA donors was enhanced when the incubations were performed in the presence of 1 mmCoCl2 (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 4, and 6), but that labeling was greatest by far with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA. Measurement of radioactivity in lipid X (formed in the presence of 1 mm CoCl2) using a TLC scanner indicated that labeling with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA was at least 20-fold greater than with [3H]myristoyl-CoA or [3H]stearoyl-CoA. To determine whether lipid X is a GPI, we measured its sensitivity to GPI-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD). In this experiment we first purified [3H]palmitate-labeled lipid X on solvent system A, and then fractionated it again on system B, an acidic system. The second fractionation revealed a3H-labeled contaminant (indicated by an arrow) that was sometimes present in preparations of lipid X (Fig.3 A, lane 3). GPI-PLD treatment resulted in cleavage of lipid X to a product that comigrated with an authentic lyso-phosphatidic acid standard (Fig. 3 A, lane 4). As a control, [3H]myristate-labeled glycolipid A (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) was also susceptible to GPI-PLD digestion, forming dimyristoyl-phosphatidic acid which had a TLC mobility close to that of a dipalmitoyl-phosphatidic acid standard (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). The fact that the only radiolabeled product of lipid X produced by GPI-PLD was lyso-phosphatidic acid indicated that all of its [3H]palmitate is linked to glycerol. We also analyzed the radiolabeled fatty acids on lipid X by producing fatty acid-methyl esters and resolving them by reverse phase TLC. We found that the radiolabeled fatty acids were exclusively palmitate, with no detectable myristate (data not shown). We also found that lipid X labeled with [3H]myristoyl-CoA or [3H]stearoyl-CoA (see Fig. 2, lanes 2 and6) is sensitive to GPI-PLD, forming alyso-phosphatidic acid (data not shown). Furthermore, the latter two forms of lipid X contained either [3H]myristate or [3H]stearate, with no contaminating [3H]palmitic acid, as determined by fatty acid-methyl ester analysis using reverse phase TLC (data not shown). The susceptibility of lipid X to GPI-PLD indicated that it is a previously unrecognized trypanosome GPI species. This fact, together with its novel conditions for radiolabeling and its specific incorporation of [3H]palmitate, stimulated us to investigate further both its structure and its metabolism. We used enzymatic digestions and chemical treatments to characterize lipid X that had been TLC purified using both solvent systems A and B (Fig.3 B, lane 1). The resistance of lipid X to PI-PLC (Fig.3 B, lane 2) (36Mensa-Wilmot K. Morris J.C. Al-Qahtani A. Englund P.T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 641-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), together with its susceptibility to GPI-PLD (Fig. 3 A, lane 4), suggests that lipid X has a fatty acylated inositol residue. If lipid X lacks a phosphoethanolamine, then it should be sensitive to JBAM, an enzyme which removes all mannose residues from a T. brucei-free GPI which lacks phosphoethanolamine (14Milne K.G. Ferguson M.A.J. Masterson W.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37Ferguson M.A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N.M. Lipid Modifications of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-230Google Scholar). As a control for the JBAM treatment, authentic [3H]myristate-labeled Man3GlcN-PI was digested to form [3H]myristate-labeled GlcN-PI (Fig.3 B, lane 11). Approximately 70% of lipid X was susceptible to JBAM digestion (as judged by densitometry of the autoradiograph), forming a product (Fig. 3 B, lane 3) that migrated close to the GlcN-PI standard (Fig. 3 B, lane 11). These results suggest that lipid X lacks phosphoethanolamine and contains at least one mannose residue. Lipid X comigrated with a [3H]myristate-labeled Man1GlcNAc-PI standard in other TLC solvent systems (data not shown). Another characteristic of GPIs is sensitivity to cleavage by nitrous acid (HONO) deamination (38Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1985; 239: 753-759Crossref Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, lipid X proved to be resistant to HONO treatment (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). This finding contrasted with that of glycolipid A or Man3GlcN-PI, conventional GPIs which formed PI on treatment with HONO (Fig. 5,lanes 8 and 10). The resistance of lipid X to HONO suggests that it does not contain a free amino group on its glucosamine residue. A possible explanation would be that it containedN-acetylglucosamine. Taken together, all of these experiments suggest that lipid X could have the structure: Man1GlcNAc-(2-O-acyl)-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-lyso-palmitoylglycerol. We purified [3H]palmitate-labeled lipid X from 1011 digitonin-permeabilized trypanosomes by 2 consecutive preparative TLC steps (using solvent systems A and B) followed by RP-HPLC on a C8 column eluted with a gradient of propan-1-ol. Lipid X eluted as a single species at approximately 65% propan-1-ol (just after the elution position of an authentic [3H]myristate-labeled glycolipid A standard). An aliquot of purified lipid X was applied to a microbore C8 RP-HPLC column and eluted with a gradient of propan-1-ol. In this system, radioactive lipid X eluted with virtually the same retention time as synthetic (di-palmitoyl)GlcN-PI (Figs. 4,A and B). Another aliquot of purified lipid X was applied to the microbore column but this time with the eluate connected online to an electrospray mass spectrometer. Negative ion electrospray mass spectrometry spectra were collected over the range m/z600–1600. At the elution position of radiolabeled lipid X, only one major ion (at m/z 1175) was detected (Fig.5) and the selected ion chromatogram of this ion is shown in Fig. 4 C. This ion is consistent with the average mass of an [M − H]− ion of a molecule with the composition: Hex1, HexNAc1, inositol1, (HPO4)1, glycerol1, palmitate2. These data are consistent with the other analyses and suggest that the acyl chain attached to the inositol ring is also palmitic acid. The proposed structure of lipid X may therefore be refined to Man1GlcNAc-(2-O-palmitoyl)-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-lyso-palmitoylglycerol. To evaluate the biological significance of this molecule, our next studies, described below, concerned the metabolism of lipid X. We studied the kinetics of lipid X labeling. Labeling of lipid X with [3H]palmitate in the presence of Co2+ occurs very rapidly with significant levels detectable after 1 min incubation (Fig. 6 A, lane 1) and maximum labeling occurring after 5–10 min (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2 and3). Thereafter, lipid X breakdown exceeds formation and there is a slow decline of label in this species (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4 and 5). In the absence of Co2+, maximum labeling of lipid X is reached slightly earlier, after only 1 min incubation, and there exists a subsequent more rapid breakdown (Fig.6 B, lanes 1–4; in this experiment there is a radiolabeled contaminant that migrates just below lipid X). Further investigation revealed that lipid X breakdown could be increased so that it greatly exceeded its formation. Lipid X was labeled for 5 min in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2and 10 mm EDTA (Fig. 6 C, lane 1). Subsequently, membranes were centrifuged to remove buffer containing Mg2+and EDTA. After resuspending membranes in incubation buffer they were incubated in the absence of divalent cations (Fig. 6 C, lanes 2–5), in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2 (Fig.6 C, lanes 6–9) or in the presence of 1 mmCoCl2 (Fig. 6 C, lanes 10–13) for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min. Upon removal of EDTA, lipid X in the absence of divalent cations disappeared almost completely after only 1 min incubation at 37 °C (Fig. 6 C, lane 2). There was a similar rate of breakdown in the presence of 3 mm MgCl2 (Fig.6 C, lane 6). However, breakdown was reduced substantially with the inclusion of 1 mm CoCl2 in the reaction mixture, with significant levels of lipid X existing for at least 5 min (Fig. 6 C, lane 11) and with some remaining even at 15 min (Fig. 6 C, lane 12). All these results indicate that lipid X is an intermediate in a metabolic pathway, with Mg2+ inhibiting its formation and Co2+inhibiting its breakdown. In an attempt to study lipid X breakdown we found that DFP reduces the steady-state level of this species. We incubated permeabilized trypanosomes with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA in the presence of 0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mm DFP. As shown in Fig.7 (lanes 1–4), increasing the concentration of DFP decreased the labeling of lipid X, with concomitant labeling of comparable amounts of another species, designated lipid Y. Lipid Y comigrated with an authenticlyso-phosphatidic acid standard and the product of lipid X digested with GPI-PLD (data not shown). We purified lipid Y (Fig.7, lane 6), and digested it with alkaline phosphatase (Fig.7, lane 7), yielding a lipid (marked by arrow) which migrated close to a [3H]myristoyl-glycerol standard (Fig. 7, lane 5). Analysis of this species using reverse phase-TLC provided further evidence that this species is palmitoyl-glycerol (data not shown). Therefore we conclude that lipid Y has the structure lyso-palmitoyl-phosphatidic acid. In “Discussion” we will speculate on the possible relationship of lipid X and lipid Y. We have discovered a novel GPI in T. brucei which we have designated lipid X. The structure of lipid X is Man1GlcNAc-(2-O-palmitoyl)-myo-inositol-1-HPO4-lyso-palmitoylglycerol. We detected lipid X by incubation of digitonin-permeabilized trypanosomes with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA, and we found that its production was stimulated when Mg2+ and Mn2+ (both required for GPI biosynthesis) were reduced in concentration or removed (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). Production was stimulated even further on addition of 1 mmCo2+ (Fig. 1, lane 5). We observed similar effects of cations on the production of lipid X in washed trypanosome membranes (which are highly efficient in supporting GPI biosynthesis in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmMnCl2), although the level of lipid X was 2-fold higher in the permeabilized cells. Lipid X had not been observed previously because ionic conditions which favor GPI biosynthesis greatly reduce its labeling. The kinetics of formation of lipid X are extremely rapid. For example, there is maximal labeling of lipid X within 1 min (Fig. 6 B, lane 1), and under other conditions it was degraded equally rapidly (Fig. 6 C, lanes 2 and 6). We were able to detect large amounts of this species only by manipulation of the ionic conditions. Evidence presented in Fig. 6 indicates that lipid X is a transient species, with Mg2+ inhibiting its formation and Co2+ inhibiting its breakdown. Such an intermediate could be involved in GPI biosynthesis or breakdown. Since its structure does not fit into the well known pathway of biosynthesis, we can speculate that it is an intermediate in GPI catabolism. It is already known that GPIs are synthesized at a level about 10-fold greater than that needed to provide GPI anchors for VSG, raising the possibility of a catabolic pathway (30Güther M.L.S.

Glycolipid A (the GPI precursor) is known to be in equilibrium with glycolipid C (identical to glycolipid A, except for having an acylated inositol). The equilibrium is maintained by an inositol acylase and a deacylase (20Güther M.L. Ferguson M.A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3080-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The function of glycolipid C is not known, but one possibility (already suggested in Ref. 30Güther M.L.S. Masterson W.J. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is that it is an intermediate in GPI catabolism. Lipid X could form from glycolipid C by removal of phosphoethanolamine and two mannose residues, N-acetylation of the glucosamine residue, and subsequent removal of the two myristates from glycerol; the glycerol would then be acylated by a single palmitate, forming lipid X. Lipid X could subsequently break down and possible products could be palmitoyl-lyso-phosphatidic acid (lipid Y in Fig. 7) and another more polar species containing palmitoylinositol. According to this scheme, DFP would allow the breakdown of lipid X but inhibit further metabolism of lipid Y. An alternative pathway for catabolism would involve a phosphatidic acid exchange mechanism (Fig.8). In this scheme glycolipid C would be degraded to a Man1GlcNAc-(acyl)PI and the resulting Man1GlcNAc-(acyl)inositol headgroup would be exchanged with a preformed palmitoyl-lyso-phosphatidic acid, forming lipid X. The (dimyristoyl)phosphatidic acid moiety would be rapidly degraded releasing myristate that could be recycled into the fatty acid remodeling and exchange pathways. The lipid X would then be cleaved into a Man1GlcNAc-(acyl)inositol headgroup for further degradation and a palmitoyl-lyso-phosphatidic acid. This lyso-phosphatidic acid could then be recycled in the phosphatidic acid exchange mechanism. The levels of lipid X and palmitoyl-lyso-phosphatidic acid may be low but would continually recycle. Only when we disturb the cycle with Co2+ or DFP are we able to observe these intermediates. It was surprising that lipid X labeled efficiently with [3H]palmitate. Other trypanosome GPIs label specifically with [3H]myristate, as the VSG GPI anchor contains myristate as its sole fatty acid (39Ferguson M.A.J. Low M.G. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14547-14555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Myristoylation occurs after GPI biosynthesis, in a fatty acid remodeling reaction, by sequential deacylation and reacylation (12Masterson W.J. Raper J. Doering T.L. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Cell. 1990; 62: 73-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A second myristoylation reaction, known as myristate exchange and for which the major substrate is VSG which already has a GPI anchor, may be a proofreading reaction to ensure that VSG contains only myristate (23Buxbaum L.U. Raper J. Opperdoes F.R. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30212-30220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Buxbaum L.U. Milne K.G. Werbovetz K.A. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1178-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We speculate that lipid X is palmitoylated because the use of another fatty acid allows the myristate to be preserved for reuse. Trypanosomes cannot synthesize myristate (35Doering T.L. Pessin M.S. Hoff E.F. Hart G.W. Raben D.M. Englund P.T. J. Biol.

Estimation of the concentration of myristate in the blood indicates that there is barely enough to sustain VSG biosynthesis when trypanosomes reach a parasitemia of over 109 cells/ml. Therefore it is essential, during GPI metabolism, that myristate be conserved and perhaps it is even protected from being elongated to other fatty acids (35Doering T.L. Pessin M.S. Hoff E.F.

https://openalex.org/W2051194140,"All G protein-coupled receptors are predicted to consist of a bundle of seven transmembrane helices (I-VII) that are connected by various extracellular and intracellular loops. At present, little is known about the molecular interactions that are critical for the proper assembly of the transmembrane receptor core. To address this issue, we took advantage of the ability of coexpressed N- and C-terminal m3 muscarinic receptor fragments to form functional receptor complexes (Schoneberg, T., Liu, J., and Wess, J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 18000-18006). As a model system, we used two polypeptides, referred to as m3-trunk and m3-tail, that were generated by splitting the m3 muscarinic receptor within the third intracellular loop. We initially demonstrated, by employing a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay strategy, that the two receptor fragments directly associate with each other when coexpressed in COS-7 cells. Additional studies with N- and C-terminal fragments derived from other G protein-coupled receptors showed that fragment association was highly receptor-specific. In subsequent experiments, the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system was used to identify amino acids that are required for proper fragment (receptor) assembly. Point mutations were introduced into m3-trunk or m3-tail, and the ability of these mutations to interfere with efficient fragment assembly was examined. These studies showed that three highly conserved proline residues (located in transmembrane helices V, VI, and VII) are essential for proper fragment association (receptor assembly). Interestingly, incubation with classical muscarinic agonists and antagonists or allosteric ligands led to significant increases in the efficiency of fragment association (particularly upon substitution of the conserved proline residues), indicating that all of these ligands can act as anchors between the m3-trunk and m3-tail fragments. The approach described here should be generally applicable to gain deeper insight into the molecular mechanisms governing G protein-coupled receptor structure and assembly."

Moreover, despite its initial identification in leukemic cells, targeted disruption of theSCL locus has demonstrated that SCL expression is absolutely required for normal hematopoietic development (9Robb L.

McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Three principal classes of bHLH proteins have been identified (14Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschica S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Class A bHLH proteins include the E proteins E2A/ITF1 (immunoglobulin transcriptionfactor 1), E2-2/ITF2, and HEB (an E protein related to E2A/ITF1 and E2-2/ITF2); these proteins are expressed ubiquitously. In contrast, the expression of class B bHLH proteins, such as MyoD and SCL, is restricted to specific organs or tissues. The myogenic (MyoD, myogenin, myf5) bHLH proteins have been studied extensively (15Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and serve as a useful paradigm for the actions of tissue-restricted bHLH proteins. MyoD forms a heterodimer with the ubiquitously expressed E2A proteins (16Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), binds specific DNA sequence at the regulatory regions of genes coding for muscle-specific proteins (such as muscle creatine kinase), and activates transcription of these genes (17Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although unproven, it is thought that SCL activates transcription of genes required for normal hematopoietic development in an analogous fashion (18Shivadasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Several forms of the SCL protein have been found in mammalian cells (19Elwood N.J. Green A.R. Melder A. Begley C.G. Nicola N. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 106-114PubMed Google Scholar); the full-length form of SCL has a molecular mass variously reported to be between 42 and 49 kDa, whereas an amino-terminally truncated form of 22–26 kDa is produced by translation of alternatively spliced transcripts (20Aplan P.D. Begley C.G. Bertness V. Nussmeier M. Ezquerra A. Colligan J. Kirsch I.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6426-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in both normal and leukemic cells. Although a transcription activation domain has been mapped to its amino terminus (21Wadman I.A. Hsu H.-L. Cobb M.H. Baer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3713-3716PubMed Google Scholar), unscheduled synthesis of an SCL protein that lacks the transactivation domain leads to T-cell leukemia in transgenic mice, indicating that this transactivation domain is not required for leukemogenesis (8Aplan P.D. Jones C.A. Chervinsky D.S. Zhao X.-F. Ellsworth M. Wu C. McGuire E.A. Gross K.W EMBO J. 1997; 9: 2408-2419Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar to many other bHLH proteins, SCL has been shown to bind several E proteins, including E2-2/ITF2 (22Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Shoham M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2683-2688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), E12, and E47 (two alternatively spliced forms of E2A/ITF1) (23Hsu H.-L. Cheng J.-T. Chen Q. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3037-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When bound to E12, the SCL·E12 complex preferentially binds to a CAGATG nucleotide sequence in vitro (24Hsu H.-L. Huang L. Tsan T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.-S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although SCL is suspected to function as a sequence-specific transcription factor, no target genes for SCL have thus far been convincingly identified, and any mechanism by which SCL may control transcription remains unknown.TFIIH is a multicomponent basal transcription factor complex that is also known to function in certain DNA repair pathways (25Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Nine subunits have been identified within the TFIIH holoenzyme complex; various enzymatic activities, including DNA repair, helicase (26Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoejimakers J.H.J. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. Science. 1993; 260: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), and cyclin-dependent kinase (27Adamczewski J.P. Rossignol M. Tassan J.-P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) activities, have been identified. The p62, p52, p44, and p34 subunits are thought to constitute the “core” of the TFIIH transcription machinery (28Marinoni J.C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Gomez D.M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the p44 and p34 subunits have no defined enzymatic activity, their zinc finger structures suggest that they may be DNA-binding proteins (29Humbert S. van Vuuren H. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.-M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that might mediate interactions with soluble transcription factors.Here we report the identification of an unexpected interaction between SCL and the p44 subunit of TFIIH. This observation provides a link between SCL and the basal transcription machinery, suggesting that SCL may exert its suspected transcription regulatory effects through an interaction with TFIIH.DISCUSSIONUsing a yeast two-hybrid system, we have isolated several SCL-binding proteins, both expected and unexpected, from three different human cDNA libraries. As expected, the most prevalent SCL-binding partners recovered from these screens were E proteins, including E2A/ITF1, E2-2/ITF2, and HEB (14Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschica S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). We also used the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate previously unreported interactions between SCL and NHLH1 as well as a homodimeric interaction of SCL with itself. A human form of the DRG protein was also isolated from a human thymus cDNA library; this was not surprising given that mouse DRG has been isolated from a mouse erythroleukemia cell line (MEL) (35Mahajan M.A. Park S.T. Sun X.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2343-2350PubMed Google Scholar) using the 22–26-kDa form of SCL as the bait protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen.However, we were surprised by the isolation of the p44 subunit of TFIIH from the human thymus cDNA library. Although interactions between bHLH proteins (e.g. c-Myc and MyoD) and basal transcription machinery have been documented (41Maheswaran S. Lee H. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1147-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Heller H. Bengal E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), those studies involved the interaction with TBP, the first basal transcription factor that is recruited to an activated promoter (43Kornberg R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 325-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The interaction between a bHLH protein and TFIIH, which is recruited to the transcription initiation complex relatively late and functions in promoter clearance and elongation of transcription (25Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), has not been previously reported.Several functional domains have been mapped to portions of the SCL protein; the amino-terminal region is proline-rich and has been shown to contain a transcription activation domain (21Wadman I.A. Hsu H.-L. Cobb M.H. Baer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3713-3716PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the bHLH domain is involved in both DNA binding and dimerization with other bHLH proteins (44Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The p44-binding region of SCL was mapped to a region that includes the bHLH domain as well as amino acid residues immediately N- and C-terminal to the bHLH domain. Although the bHLH domain was included in the region essential for binding, it is possible that the bHLH domain may only serve as an arm to link the N- and C-terminal flanking regions together to form a binding domain for p44. Support for this possibility is found in the observation that only SCL, among several bHLH proteins tested, was able to bind p44 in the yeast two-hybrid system, indicating that the bHLH structure alone is not sufficient for this interaction. For example, LYL1 (a bHLH protein named by virtue of its involvement in a chromosomal translocation associated with lymphoblasticleukemia) has a bHLH region that is quite similar (49/55 identical amino acids and four conservative substitutions) to SCL (1Begley C.G. Aplan P.D. Denning S.M. Haynes B.F. Waldmann T.A. Kirsch I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10128-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Despite this, an interaction between LYL1 and p44 was not detected with this system, suggesting that the interaction between SCL and p44 requires amino acids proximal and distal to the bHLH region. Our results also show that the C-terminal polyglycine tract is important for the interaction; this is not surprising because glycine-rich domains have been shown to mediate other protein/protein interactions (45Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the SCL C-terminal glycine tract itself is not sufficient for the SCL/p44 interaction (see Fig. 4). The SCL-binding region of p44 was mapped to the C-terminal region of p44. This region is composed of 166 amino acids (from Lys-229 to Val-395), containing two putative functional motifs (29Humbert S. van Vuuren H. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.-M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One of these motifs, the TFIIIA-like zinc finger motif, was found to interact with DNA; the second motif, whose function is unknown, is conserved in both p44 and Ssl1, the yeast homologue of human p44. Although the SCL-binding domain of p44 has not yet been clearly defined, the above two motifs are potential targets for future studies.It is not clear how the interaction between SCL and p44 might function in a biological context. However, some insight may be gained through the study of previously reported interactions between nonessential transcription factors and elements of the basal transcription complex. Several proteins in addition to those of the basal transcription complex have been shown to interact with TFIIH subunits. These proteins include p53, which has been shown to interact in vitro with the XPB subunit of TFIIH (46Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.R. Harris C.C Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar); this interaction is thought to modulate either the nucleotide excision repair activity of TFIIH (47Wang X.W. Yhe H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmaker J.H.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) or p53-mediated apoptosis (48Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmaker J.H.J. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Additionally, the transcription activation domain of VP16 has been shown to bind the p62 subunit of TFIIH (49Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), resulting in activation of transcription from an adenovirus type 2 major late promoter. With regard to interactions between bHLH proteins and basal transcription factors, the bHLH transcription factor c-Myc has been shown to bind the basal transcription factor TBP (50Hateboer G. Timmers H.T. Rustgi A.K. Billaud M. van't Veer L.J. Bernards R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8489-8493Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, one hypothesis regarding the functional relevance of an SCL/p44 interaction speculates that SCL, itself or as a heterodimer with an E protein, interacts with p44, thus modulating the activity of TFIIH and eventually the transcription elongation.In summary, we have demonstrated a specific interaction, both in vivo and in vitro, between the bHLH protein SCL and the p44 subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIIH. Although this interaction was mapped to a region of SCL that encompassed, but was not limited to, the bHLH domain, other bHLH proteins did not demonstrate binding to p44. This novel interaction between a bHLH protein and TFIIH suggests a potential mechanism by which the tissue-restricted bHLH protein SCL might function during hematopoietic and vascular development.

Indeed, recent transgenic mouse models have confirmed that unscheduled SCL expression leads to aggressive T-cell malignancies (7Larson R.C. Lavenir I. Larson T.A. Baer R. Warren A.J. Wadman I.

Moreover, despite its initial identification in leukemic cells, targeted disruption of theSCL locus has demonstrated that SCL expression is absolutely required for normal hematopoietic development (9Robb L.

SCL belongs to the basic domain helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic domain helix-loop-helix; SD, synthetic dextrose; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tp44, truncated p44; GAD, GAL4 transcription activation domain; GBD, GAL4 DNA-binding domain. 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic domain helix-loop-helix; SD, synthetic dextrose; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Tp44, truncated p44; GAD, GAL4 transcription activation domain; GBD, GAL4 DNA-binding domain. family of proteins (13Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). Three principal classes of bHLH proteins have been identified (14Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschica S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). Class A bHLH proteins include the E proteins E2A/ITF1 (immunoglobulin transcriptionfactor 1), E2-2/ITF2, and HEB (an E protein related to E2A/ITF1 and E2-2/ITF2); these proteins are expressed ubiquitously. In contrast, the expression of class B bHLH proteins, such as MyoD and SCL, is restricted to specific organs or tissues. The myogenic (MyoD, myogenin, myf5) bHLH proteins have been studied extensively (15Weintraub H. Cell. 1993; 75: 1241-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) and serve as a useful paradigm for the actions of tissue-restricted bHLH proteins. MyoD forms a heterodimer with the ubiquitously expressed E2A proteins (16Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), binds specific DNA sequence at the regulatory regions of genes coding for muscle-specific proteins (such as muscle creatine kinase), and activates transcription of these genes (17Jaynes J.B. Johnson J.E. Buskin J.N. Gartside C.L. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although unproven, it is thought that SCL activates transcription of genes required for normal hematopoietic development in an analogous fashion (18Shivadasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1996; 87: 4025-4039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several forms of the SCL protein have been found in mammalian cells (19Elwood N.J. Green A.R. Melder A. Begley C.G. Nicola N. Leukemia. 1994; 8: 106-114PubMed Google Scholar); the full-length form of SCL has a molecular mass variously reported to be between 42 and 49 kDa, whereas an amino-terminally truncated form of 22–26 kDa is produced by translation of alternatively spliced transcripts (20Aplan P.D. Begley C.G. Bertness V. Nussmeier M. Ezquerra A. Colligan J. Kirsch I.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6426-6435Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) in both normal and leukemic cells. Although a transcription activation domain has been mapped to its amino terminus (21Wadman I.A. Hsu H.-L. Cobb M.H. Baer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3713-3716PubMed Google Scholar), unscheduled synthesis of an SCL protein that lacks the transactivation domain leads to T-cell leukemia in transgenic mice, indicating that this transactivation domain is not required for leukemogenesis (8Aplan P.D. Jones C.A. Chervinsky D.S. Zhao X.-F. Ellsworth M. Wu C. McGuire E.A. Gross K.W EMBO J. 1997; 9: 2408-2419Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similar to many other bHLH proteins, SCL has been shown to bind several E proteins, including E2-2/ITF2 (22Goldfarb A.N. Lewandowska K. Shoham M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2683-2688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), E12, and E47 (two alternatively spliced forms of E2A/ITF1) (23Hsu H.-L. Cheng J.-T. Chen Q. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3037-3042Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). When bound to E12, the SCL·E12 complex preferentially binds to a CAGATG nucleotide sequence in vitro (24Hsu H.-L. Huang L. Tsan T. Funk W. Wright W.E. Hu J.-S. Kingston R.E. Baer R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although SCL is suspected to function as a sequence-specific transcription factor, no target genes for SCL have thus far been convincingly identified, and any mechanism by which SCL may control transcription remains unknown. TFIIH is a multicomponent basal transcription factor complex that is also known to function in certain DNA repair pathways (25Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Nine subunits have been identified within the TFIIH holoenzyme complex; various enzymatic activities, including DNA repair, helicase (26Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoejimakers J.H.J. Chambon P. Egly J.-M. Science. 1993; 260: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), and cyclin-dependent kinase (27Adamczewski J.P. Rossignol M. Tassan J.-P. Nigg E.A. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1877-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) activities, have been identified. The p62, p52, p44, and p34 subunits are thought to constitute the “core” of the TFIIH transcription machinery (28Marinoni J.C. Roy R. Vermeulen W. Miniou P. Lutz Y. Weeda G. Seroz T. Gomez D.M. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.-M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although the p44 and p34 subunits have no defined enzymatic activity, their zinc finger structures suggest that they may be DNA-binding proteins (29Humbert S. van Vuuren H. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.-M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) that might mediate interactions with soluble transcription factors. Here we report the identification of an unexpected interaction between SCL and the p44 subunit of TFIIH. This observation provides a link between SCL and the basal transcription machinery, suggesting that SCL may exert its suspected transcription regulatory effects through an interaction with TFIIH. DISCUSSIONUsing a yeast two-hybrid system, we have isolated several SCL-binding proteins, both expected and unexpected, from three different human cDNA libraries. As expected, the most prevalent SCL-binding partners recovered from these screens were E proteins, including E2A/ITF1, E2-2/ITF2, and HEB (14Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschica S.D. Lassar A.B. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). We also used the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate previously unreported interactions between SCL and NHLH1 as well as a homodimeric interaction of SCL with itself. A human form of the DRG protein was also isolated from a human thymus cDNA library; this was not surprising given that mouse DRG has been isolated from a mouse erythroleukemia cell line (MEL) (35Mahajan M.A. Park S.T. Sun X.-H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2343-2350PubMed Google Scholar) using the 22–26-kDa form of SCL as the bait protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen.However, we were surprised by the isolation of the p44 subunit of TFIIH from the human thymus cDNA library. Although interactions between bHLH proteins (e.g. c-Myc and MyoD) and basal transcription machinery have been documented (41Maheswaran S. Lee H. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1147-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Heller H. Bengal E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2112-2120Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), those studies involved the interaction with TBP, the first basal transcription factor that is recruited to an activated promoter (43Kornberg R.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 325-326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The interaction between a bHLH protein and TFIIH, which is recruited to the transcription initiation complex relatively late and functions in promoter clearance and elongation of transcription (25Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.-M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), has not been previously reported.Several functional domains have been mapped to portions of the SCL protein; the amino-terminal region is proline-rich and has been shown to contain a transcription activation domain (21Wadman I.A. Hsu H.-L. Cobb M.H. Baer R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3713-3716PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the bHLH domain is involved in both DNA binding and dimerization with other bHLH proteins (44Tapscott S.J. Weintraub H. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The p44-binding region of SCL was mapped to a region that includes the bHLH domain as well as amino acid residues immediately N- and C-terminal to the bHLH domain. Although the bHLH domain was included in the region essential for binding, it is possible that the bHLH domain may only serve as an arm to link the N- and C-terminal flanking regions together to form a binding domain for p44. Support for this possibility is found in the observation that only SCL, among several bHLH proteins tested, was able to bind p44 in the yeast two-hybrid system, indicating that the bHLH structure alone is not sufficient for this interaction. For example, LYL1 (a bHLH protein named by virtue of its involvement in a chromosomal translocation associated with lymphoblasticleukemia) has a bHLH region that is quite similar (49/55 identical amino acids and four conservative substitutions) to SCL (1Begley C.G. Aplan P.D. Denning S.M. Haynes B.F. Waldmann T.A. Kirsch I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 10128-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Despite this, an interaction between LYL1 and p44 was not detected with this system, suggesting that the interaction between SCL and p44 requires amino acids proximal and distal to the bHLH region. Our results also show that the C-terminal polyglycine tract is important for the interaction; this is not surprising because glycine-rich domains have been shown to mediate other protein/protein interactions (45Cartegni L. Maconi M. Morandi E. Cobianchi F. Riva S. Biamonti G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, the SCL C-terminal glycine tract itself is not sufficient for the SCL/p44 interaction (see Fig. 4). The SCL-binding region of p44 was mapped to the C-terminal region of p44. This region is composed of 166 amino acids (from Lys-229 to Val-395), containing two putative functional motifs (29Humbert S. van Vuuren H. Lutz Y. Hoeijmakers J.H. Egly J.-M. Moncollin V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2393-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). One of these motifs, the TFIIIA-like zinc finger motif, was found to interact with DNA; the second motif, whose function is unknown, is conserved in both p44 and Ssl1, the yeast homologue of human p44. Although the SCL-binding domain of p44 has not yet been clearly defined, the above two motifs are potential targets for future studies.It is not clear how the interaction between SCL and p44 might function in a biological context. However, some insight may be gained through the study of previously reported interactions between nonessential transcription factors and elements of the basal transcription complex. Several proteins in addition to those of the basal transcription complex have been shown to interact with TFIIH subunits. These proteins include p53, which has been shown to interact in vitro with the XPB subunit of TFIIH (46Wang X.W. Forrester K. Yeh H. Feitelson M.A. Gu J.R. Harris C.C Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2230-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar); this interaction is thought to modulate either the nucleotide excision repair activity of TFIIH (47Wang X.W. Yhe H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.-M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Weeda G. Hoeijmaker J.H.J. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) or p53-mediated apoptosis (48Wang X.W. Vermeulen W. Coursen J.D. Gibson M. Lupold S.E Forrester K. Xu G. Elmore L. Yeh H. Hoeijmaker J.H.J. Harris C.C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1219-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Additionally, the transcription activation domain of VP16 has been shown to bind the p62 subunit of TFIIH (49Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), resulting in activation of transcription from an adenovirus type 2 major late promoter. With regard to interactions between bHLH proteins and basal transcription factors, the bHLH transcription factor c-Myc has been shown to bind the basal transcription factor TBP (50Hateboer G. Timmers H.T. Rustgi A.K. Billaud M. van't Veer L.J. Bernards R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8489-8493Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Therefore, one hypothesis regarding the functional relevance of an SCL/p44 interaction speculates that SCL, itself or as a heterodimer with an E protein, interacts with p44, thus modulating the activity of TFIIH and eventually the transcription elongation.In summary, we have demonstrated a specific interaction, both in vivo and in vitro, between the bHLH protein SCL and the p44 subunit of the basal transcription factor TFIIH. Although this interaction was mapped to a region of SCL that encompassed, but was not limited to, the bHLH domain, other bHLH proteins did not demonstrate binding to p44. This novel interaction between a bHLH protein and TFIIH suggests a potential mechanism by which the tissue-restricted bHLH protein SCL might function during hematopoietic and vascular development.
