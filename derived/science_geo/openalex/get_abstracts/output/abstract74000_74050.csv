There have been at least two occasions when accidental contamination of soil and water by fluoracetamide has occurred2. This communication reports the isolation of bacteria able to use these compounds for growth."

https://openalex.org/W2007132298,"MANY studies have shown that increasing age results in a deficiency in ability to acquire new skills and information. However, the commonly held view that older people manifest an impairment in the retention of acquired material has received equivocal support from laboratory investigations1,2. Even Inglis's recent demonstration3 of a loss with age in short-term memory is confined to an hypothesized storage system with a limit of approximately 4 sec. I wish to direct attention to the results of an experiment which suggests that the aged show special defects in the remembering of acquired material stored over longer periods of time. These defects seem to be due to a loss in ability to retrieve memories from storage rather than a deficiency in the storage system itself."

https://openalex.org/W2008463084,"FROM the several cases of human cryptococcosis (torulosis or European blastomycosis) reported from Great Britain it is apparent that this is not an uncommon mycosis in this part of the world. Recently, Rook and Woods1 listed twenty-two cases of the disease recorded in Britain. There does not appear to have been any published information, however, on the saprophytic habits of the causative fungus (Cryptococcus neoformans) in Britain. The following is a report on the isolation of C. neoformans from pigeon habitats in London, a preliminary notification of which was made at the International Academy of Pathology Symposium on Mycotic Diseases (June 1964) by one of us (R. W. R.)."

https://openalex.org/W2011263398,UROKINASE is a proteolytic enzyme in human urine1. Its ability to activate plasminogen has stimulated interest in its potential clinical use as a thrombolytic agent.

https://openalex.org/W2004465989,"IN a previous communication1, we reported the finding of pre-erythrocytic tissue schizonts of P. berghei in the liver of an experimentally infected young hamster. The forms observed were few in number, involving examination of many hundreds of stained liver sections. The sporozoites used in the former experiments were derived from experimentally infected Anopheles quadrimaculatus. In this laboratory vector only small numbers of viable sporozoites reached the salivary glands. The introduction of Anopheles stephensi as an experimental vector of P. berghei2 has greatly facilitated and advanced our work, for in this mosquito species invasion of the salivary glands by very large numbers of sporozoites takes place with regularity after exposure to gametocyte carriers and maintenance at 21° C."

https://openalex.org/W2088674056,"THE problem of the evolution of intelligent behaviour has recently achieved publicity1 in relation to work on the learning abilities of various vertebrates2. Over the past three years I have developed a general theory of the evolution of intelligence from, and within the framework of, an instinct system of Lorenz–Tinbergen type3. This theory is of wider scope than any which could be advanced on the basis of the present theories of learning; it can, it is felt, accommodate most of the ‘learning theory’ views; and it appears to provide a context for the understanding of a considerable variety of other phenomena. An extended account and discussion of this general theory of the evolution of intelligence is being offered for publication elsewhere—but a very brief preliminary account appears desirable, to stimulate interdisciplinary appraisal and discussion."

https://openalex.org/W2062013220,IT is known that the degree of polymerization of purified hyaluronic acid depends on the sources of preparation and the method of isolation. Caputo and I previously reported1 the occurrence in Rous sarcoma of highly polymerized hyaluronic acid complexed with protein. Investigations of the effect of proteolytic enzymes on this complex have revealed the prominent part played by the protein in the molecular conformation of the complex2.
