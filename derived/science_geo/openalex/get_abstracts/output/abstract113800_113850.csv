https://openalex.org/W1490548175,"Accumulation of cholesterol esters as cytoplasmic lipid droplets within macrophages and smooth muscle cells is a characteristic feature of early lesions of atherosclerotic plaque. Intracellularly, an essential element in forming cholesterol ester from cholesterol is the enzyme acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). ACAT is a membrane protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. The ACAT protein has never been purified to homogeneity, and no antibodies directed against ACAT have been reported. The gene(s) encoding this enzyme had not been isolated. This laboratory had previously reported the isolation of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human ACAT activity. From DNAs of these cells, we have cloned a 1.2-kb exonic human genomic DNA. This led to the eventual cloning of a 4-kb cDNA clone (K1) from a human macrophage cDNA library. Transfection of K1 in ACAT-deficient mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells complemented the mutant defect and resulted in the expression of human ACAT activity. K1 contained an open reading frame of 1650 bp encoding an integral membrane protein of 550 amino acids. Protein homology analysis showed that the predicted K1 protein shared homologous peptide sequences with other enzymes involved in the catalysis of acyl adenylate formation followed by acyl thioester formation and acyl transfer. These results indicate that K1 encodes a structural gene for ACAT. The cDNA reported here should facilitate future molecular studies on ACAT."
https://openalex.org/W1543728556,"Activation of the superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase system of human neutrophils involves the assembly of several neutrophil components, some located on the plasma membrane and others in the cytosol. It has recently been established that one of the required components for NADPH oxidase activity is the GTP-binding protein Rac. To further investigate the role of Rac in the NADPH oxidase system, studies were carried out to determine its subcellular distribution in resting and activated human neutrophils. In resting cells, Rac and an associated guanine nucleotide regulatory factor, GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI), were located only in the cytosol, along with other known oxidase factors, p47-phox and p67-phox. After activation of neutrophils with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, Rac was translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, and this translocation corresponded temporally with the translocation of p47-phox and p67-phox and with the generation of superoxide. GDI remained localized to the cytosol, suggesting activation of the oxidase involved dissociation of the Rac-GDI complex prior to Rac translocation. Determination of the quantities of cytosolic factors associated with the plasma membrane indicated that Rac, p47-phox, and p67-phox are translocated to the plasma membrane simultaneously in equimolar amounts, but that the membrane-associated cytochrome b was present at 3-4-fold molar excess. These findings suggest that Rac may play a role in assembly of the active NADPH oxidase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1857056367,"Calcium influx in electrically non-excitable cells is regulated by the filling state of intracellular calcium stores. Depletion of stores activates plasma membrane channels that are voltage-independent and highly selective for Ca2+ ions. We report here that the activation of plasma membrane Ca2+ currents induced by depletion of Ca2+ stores requires a diffusible cytosolic factor that washes out with time when dialyzing cells in the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique. The activation of calcium release-activated calcium current (ICRAC) by ionomycin- or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced store depletion is blocked by guanosine 5‘-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) and guanyl-5‘-yl imidodiphosphate, non-hydrolyzable analogs of GTP, suggesting the involvement of a GTP-binding protein. The inhibition by GTP gamma S occurs at a step prior to the activation of ICRAC and is prevented by the addition of GTP. We conclude that the activation mechanism of depletion-induced Ca2+ influx encompasses a GTP-dependent step, possibly involving an as yet unidentified small GTP-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W1551079196,"Activation of tyrosine kinase receptors causes mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase stimulation via a pathway involving p21ras, p74raf-1 (acting as a MAP kinase kinase kinase), and MAP kinase kinases; however, the pathway by which heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors activate MAP kinases is undefined. Since there are several MAP kinase kinase kinases it has been suggested that p74raf-1 may only couple tyrosine kinase receptors to MAP kinase activation. We therefore investigated the requirement for p21ras and p74raf-1 in G-protein receptor-mediated MAP kinase activation. Lysophosphatidic acid stimulates MAP kinase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway, which is blocked by dominant negative Ras. Lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated MAP kinase activation is potentiated by overexpression of p74raf-1 and blocked by expression of a dominant negative Raf protein comprising the N-terminal 259 amino acids. We conclude that lysophosphatidic acid activates MAP kinases by a G-protein-coupled pathway that requires both p21ras and p74raf-1."
https://openalex.org/W1552647544,"A new class of thrombin inhibitors based on sequence-specific single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (thrombin aptamer) has recently been identified. The aptamer-binding site on thrombin was examined by a solid-phase plate binding assay and by chemical modification. Binding assay results demonstrated that the thrombin aptamer bound specifically to alpha-thrombin but not to gamma-thrombin and that hirudin competed with aptamer binding, suggesting that thrombin's anion-binding exosite was important for aptamer-thrombin interactions. To identify lysine residues of thrombin that participated in the binding of the thrombin aptamer, thrombin was modified with fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate in the presence or absence of the thrombin aptamer, reduced, carboxymethylated, and digested with endoproteinase Arg-C. The digestion products were analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and the peptide maps compared. Four peptides with significantly decreased modification in the presence of the aptamer were identified and subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis. Results indicated that B chain Lys-21 and Lys-65, both located within the anion-binding exosite, are situated within or in close proximity to the aptamer-binding site of human alpha-thrombin. The thrombin aptamer binds to the anion-binding exosite and inhibits thrombin's function by competing with exosite binding substrates fibrinogen and the platelet thrombin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1549857682,"Cellobiohydrolase I (CBH I), the major component of Trichoderma reesei cellulolytic system, is comprised of a catalytic core domain joined to a cellulose binding-domain (CBD) by an extended O-glycosylated interdomain linker peptide. Two internal deletions were introduced to the linker in order to investigate its function particularly in the hydrolysis of crystalline cellulose. Deletion of the first one-third of the linker, including a putative hinge region, reduces the binding capacity of CBH I in high enzyme coverage but does not affect its enzymatic activity on crystalline cellulose. The longer deletion removing practically all of the linker dramatically reduces the rate of crystalline cellulose degradation even though the enzyme still binds to the substrate. We conclude that sufficient spatial separation of the two domains is required for efficient function of CBH I. It is evident that the presence of a functional CBD is increasingly important for CBH I toward higher enzyme to cellulose ratios. Our data suggest that the putative hinge removed by the first deletion facilitates CBD-driven binding and dense packing of the wild type enzyme on the cellulose surface."
https://openalex.org/W1587627449,"A survey of lipids revealed that the anionic phospholipid phosphatidic acid activates both control and tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma 1. The mechanism by which phosphatidic acid activates both forms of PLC-gamma 1 was investigated using kinetic analysis. In the presence of phosphatidic acid, the substrate concentration response for control PLC-gamma 1 changes from sigmoidal to hyperbolic, while the cooperativity index decreases from 2.5 for control to 1.0 for tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-gamma 1. The primary influence of phosphatidic acid on the control enzyme is on the cooperativity index and not the association of PLC-gamma 1 with substrate micelles, as phosphatidic acid had little effect on the micellar association constant, Ks. Phosphatidic acid also increases the activity of the tyrosine phosphorylated form of the enzyme. This increase is reflected in a decrease in the Km from 0.3- to 0.03-mol fraction phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphatidic acid has no effect on the Ks of the tyrosine-phosphorylated enzyme. From this data it is concluded that phosphatidic acid appears to activate PLC-gamma 1 by acting as an allosteric modifier."
https://openalex.org/W1576236282,"Xenobiotic responsive element (XRE) is an inducible enhancer element that drives inducible expression of P-4501A1 gene in response to xenobiotic inducers. The XRE-binding factor appears in the nuclei of Hepa-1 cells treated with 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC). Association of the Ah receptor and Arnt (Ah receptor nuclear translocator) in an XRE-binding complex was examined by anti-Ah receptor and Arnt antibodies. Both antibodies inhibited the sequence-specific XRE-binding activity of nuclear extracts from 3-MC-treated Hepa-1 cells and of the cytosolic fraction which was prepared from the nontreated cells and treated in vitro with 3-MC. These results indicate that Ah receptor and Arnt proteins are components of the XRE-binding factor and suggest that Arnt as well as the Ah receptor are localized in the cytosol of nontreated cells. The Ah receptor present in C4 cells, a mutant of Hepa-1 cells defective in the Arnt function, showed an inducer-dependent association with Arnt synthesized in an in vitro translation system. Co-transfection of the expression plasmids of the Ah receptor and Arnt exhibited synergistically more activated transcription from a reporter gene pMC6.3k consisting of the P-4501A1 gene promoter and enhancer than transfection with either of the two plasmids alone. These findings indicate that the Ah receptor and Arnt proteins form a complex that activates transcription in an inducer-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W1575097947,"We have identified the third member of a family of cationic amino acid transporters in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated murine macrophages. The deduced amino acid sequence of this transporter is the same as MCAT-2 (mouse cationic amino acid transporter-2), the low affinity transporter expressed in hepatocytes, except for a stretch of 41 amino acids that connects the eighth and ninth membrane-spanning domains. These transporters apparently result from differential splicing of transcripts from a single gene and therefore have been named MCAT-2A (hepatocyte) and MCAT-2B (macrophage). Despite their similarity, MCAT-2B is saturated at one-fifth the arginine concentration, has a lower apparent Vmax, and is more sensitive to trans-stimulation than MCAT-2. Introduction of the unique regions of MCAT-2A and MCAT-2B into the equivalent portion of the related protein, MCAT-1, created chimeric transporters with properties most like the donor of this region. Our findings suggest these 41 amino acids contain a domain that binds the amino acid substrate during its translocation across the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1492746912,"Glycoprotein V (GPV) is a major platelet membrane 82-kDa glycoprotein, missing in the Bernard-Soulier syndrome, that is cleaved when platelets are treated with thrombin. We report the cloning and sequencing of the GPV cDNA and gene obtained by a combination of polymerase chain reaction amplification of platelet mRNA and genomic library screening. The single-copy gene for GPV is contained within 6.5 kilobase pairs (kb) of genomic sequence and has a simple structure with a single intron of 958 base pairs in the 5'-untranslated sequence; the coding sequence is contained within a single exon. The promoter region contains a canonical TATA box, and putative GATA, Ets-1, and Sp1 cis-acting elements. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis on RNAs from cells of different hematopoietic origins revealed that GPV was specifically transcribed from platelets and from cells of the megakaryocytic lineage (megakaryocytes, HEL cells). A single transcript of 4.5 kb for GPV was detected in human platelets by Northern blot analysis. The entire amino acid sequence of GPV was deduced from the cDNA and genomic sequences. Mature GPV was composed of 544 amino acids which contained a single transmembrane domain, a short cytoplasmic domain (16 residues), and a large extracellular domain with 8 potential N-glycosylation sites. Analysis of the extracellular domain revealed the presence of 15 tandem Leu-rich repeats of 24 amino acids with homology to GPIb alpha and identified a cleavage site for thrombin near the COOH terminus with similarity to the A alpha chain of fibrinogen, but no hirudin-like sequence was found."
https://openalex.org/W2144022756,"A serine/threonine kinase from bovine brain has been purified (Lew, J., Beaudette, K. N., Litwin, C. M. E., and Wang, J. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 13383-13390) and found to consist of a 33-kDa catalytic subunit having high sequence homology to p34cdc2 and cdk2 (Lew, J., Winkfein, R. J., Paudel, H., and Wang, J. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 25922-25926). Substrate specificity determinants for this cdc2-like kinase were examined using synthetic peptide substrates derived from the in vitro p34cdc2 phosphorylation sites of histone H1. The peptide P-K-T-P-K-K-A-K-K-L was found to be an excellent substrate for the bovine cdc2-like kinase, having a Km value in the micromolar range. Important determinants for efficient substrate phosphorylation of this peptide were found both within the proposed substrate consensus motif (S/T-P-X-K/R) of p34cdc2 kinase and outside of this sequence. In addition to the absolute requirement for a proline residue immediately COOH-terminal to the phosphorylatable residue (+1) and a basic residue at the +3 position, a basic amino acid at the +2 position was greatly preferred over an acidic amino acid. A proline residue at the -2 position and a cluster of basic amino acids further COOH-terminal to the consensus motif were also found to be important for substrate binding. HeLa cell p34cdc2 kinase displays similar specificity to that of the bovine cdc2-like kinase, as the additional determinants outside of the consensus motif that contribute to the efficient phosphorylation of the histone peptide by this novel enzyme also appear to be important for p34cdc2-catalyzed phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1550808793,"A system that detects the formation of complexes between different proteins by linking them to separate domains of the GAL4 transcription activator protein has been used to study protein-protein interactions between four essential and unique subunits of yeast RNA polymerase III (C82, C53, C34 and C31), the 70-kDa component of the initiation transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB70) and the TATA-binding protein. We found that C82, C34, and C31 are able to combine with each other in vivo and that C34 interacts with TFIIIB70. These results suggest that C34 and TFIIIB70 are specificity determinants of the RNA polymerase III-TFIIIB interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1513220089,"Regulation of development and metabolism by thyroid hormone (T3) may be influenced by a non-T3 binding T3 receptor (TR) isoform, TR alpha 2, which can inhibit transcriptional activation by legitimate TRs. Numerous mechanisms have been postulated to explain the dominant negative actions of TR alpha 2, including competition for target genes, formation of inactive heterodimers, and squelching. We have found that excess TR alpha 2 was required to inhibit TR alpha 1-mediated transactivation from multiple T3 response elements (TREs). Inhibition of T3 action by TR alpha 2 was specific for TRE-containing genes, because a GAL4/TR alpha 1 chimera, which heterodimerized with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor (RXR) and activated transcription from the GAL4 binding site in the presence of T3, was not inhibited by TR alpha 2. In contrast, TR alpha 2 inhibited transactivation by TR alpha/VP16, a chimeric protein containing the N-terminal DNA binding domain (DBD) of TR alpha 1 fused to the transcriptional activation domain of VP16. Indeed, TR alpha 2 inhibited the binding of TR alpha 1 monomers, homodimers, and RXR-heterodimers to DNA in vitro, whereas the TR alpha 2 C terminus alone did not. Although TR alpha 2 bound to TREs with less affinity than TR alpha 1, it bound directly to target genes in the cell nucleus. Furthermore, a TR alpha 2 mutant which binds more avidly to TREs was a more effective inhibitor of T3 action than wild type TR alpha 2. Together these data indicate that TR alpha 2 inhibits T3 action by competing for binding to TREs."
https://openalex.org/W1900519315,"The folding pathway of hirudin was analyzed by structural characterization and stop/go folding experiments of acid-trapped intermediates. The results show that the folding is initiated by a near-random packing, followed by the reorganization and fine adjustment of partially compact intermediates to attain the active molecule. The process of packing is observed as the unfolded hirudin flows sequentially via three groups of equilibrated intermediates, namely one-disulfide, two-disulfide, and three-disulfide (scrambled species) isomers. Nearly all possible disulfide species were found to exist along the pathway. Specific tertiary interactions then take effect at the final stage, refining and consolidating the loosely packed intermediates, in the presence of free thiols, to form the active hirudin. The rate of packing and reorganization can be selectively regulated by a number of external factors, and conditions can be chosen to allow the completion of folding process within 10 min or 10 h."
https://openalex.org/W1538690208,"To identify the phospholipase mediating the majority of [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP)-induced release of arachidonic acid in A-10 smooth muscle cells, we exploited the specificity inherent in the mechanism-based inhibitor, (E)-6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthalenyl)-2H-pyran-2-one (HELSS), which possesses a 1,000-fold selectivity for inhibition of calcium-independent versus calcium-dependent phospholipases A2. Utilizing [3H]arachidonic acid-labeled A-10 smooth muscle cells, one-half of AVP-inducible [3H]arachidonic acid release was inhibited by pretreatment with only 1 microM HELSS and two-thirds of AVP-stimulated [3H]arachidonic acid release was inhibited by 5 microM HELSS. The inhibition of [3H]arachidonic acid release by HELSS was saturable (i.e. no additional inhibition of [3H]arachidonic acid release was present at 10 microM HELSS), specific (i.e. the activities of six intracellular enzymes, as well as the rate of glucose oxidation, were not altered by HELSS treatment), and nontoxic (i.e. HELSS-treated cells excluded trypan blue dye and did not leak intracellular enzymes into the medium). Collectively, these results demonstrate that HELSS blocks AVP-induced arachidonic acid release by specific and irreversible inhibition of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 and underscore the importance of calcium-independent phospholipase A2 in agonist-induced arachidonic acid release in at least some cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1585341352,"Roots from iron-deficient sugar beet grown in the presence of calcium carbonate exhibit a yellow color and autofluorescence typical of flavin-like compounds, whereas roots of control, iron-sufficient plants exhibited no yellow color and extremely low autofluorescence. The two major flavins whose accumulation is induced by iron deficiency have been shown to be different from riboflavin, FMN, and FAD by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. These flavins, accounting for 82 and 15% of the total flavin concentration in deficient roots, have been shown unequivocally to be riboflavin 3‘-sulfate and riboflavin 5‘-sulfate, respectively, by electrospray-mass spectrometry, inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy, infrared spectrometry, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. These flavin sulfates have not been found previously in biological systems. The localization of riboflavin sulfates in deficient roots is similar, but not identical, to that of high iron reductase activity. The concentration of riboflavin sulfates has been estimated from root extracts to be at least 1 mM. We hypothesize, based on the similar localization of flavin and that of iron reduction, that the accumulation of riboflavin sulfates induced by iron deficiency may be an integral part of the turbo iron-reducing system in sugar beet roots."
https://openalex.org/W1496647822,"The Arabidopsis thaliana 2 S albumins are examples of vacuolar proteins which undergo intensive posttranslational processing. An in vitro processing assay to screen for processing enzymes present in seeds was developed using an in vitro synthesized 2 S albumin precursor as the substrate. A protease was characterized which cleaved the substrate into two fragments with molecular weights (as determined from their migration distance on SDS-polyacrylamide gel) corresponding to those of the small and large subunits of Arabidopsis 2 S albumin. The pH optimum of this protease activity, its inhibition by pepstatin A, and partial sequence data led to the conclusion that the protease under study was an aspartic proteinase. Synthetic peptides representing two 2 S albumin propeptides allowed the determination of the in vitro cleavage sites, and suggested that the protease activity is capable, in vitro, of cleaving the amino-terminal propeptide as well as the internal propeptide linking the two subunits. Alterations of the amino acids in and around the cleavage sites, made to study the specificity of the protease activity, suggest that both structural and sequence determinants are important in cleavage site recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1540224528,"We have investigated the mechanism by which vitamin B6 acts to modulate steroid hormone-mediated gene expression. We show that the level of glucocorticoid-induced gene expression from simple promoters, containing only hormone response elements and a TATA sequence, was not affected by alterations in intracellular vitamin B6 concentration. However, modulation of hormone-induced gene expression was restored with the inclusion of a binding site for the transcription factor nuclear factor 1 (NF1) within the hormone-responsive promoter; glucocorticoid-induced gene expression was reduced by 44% under conditions of elevated intracellular vitamin B6 concentration and enhanced by 98% in mild vitamin deficiency. Under these conditions, neither glucocorticoid receptor sedimentation characteristics, receptor activation, nor DNA binding capacity was affected. Quantitatively analogous effects were detected with estrogen-induced gene expression when an NF1 binding site was removed from or introduced into an estrogen-responsive promoter. NF1-mediated constitutive transcription was not affected by alterations in vitamin concentration. The modulatory effect of vitamin did not require strict positioning of or spacing between the glucocorticoid response element and NF1 binding site. Moreover, a heterologous transcriptional activator, composed of the viral E1a transactivation domain and the GAL4 DNA binding domain, does not substitute for NF1 in restoring vitamin B6 modulation of hormone-induced gene expression. These results suggest that vitamin B6 modulates steroid hormone-mediated gene expression through its influence on a functional or cooperative interaction between steroid hormone receptors and the transcription factor NF1."

https://openalex.org/W1959615698,"The cbr gene, previously cloned from the unicellular green alga Dunaliella bardawil, is transcriptionally and translationally activated in parallel to accelerated carotenogenesis in response to light stress conditions. The product of cbr, structurally similar to Elips (early light-induced proteins of higher plants), is associated with a minor light harvesting complexes of photosystem II component (Levy, H., Gokhman, I., and Zamir, A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 18831-18836). This study examines the relationship between the induction of Cbr and another plant response to light stress, the deepoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin. A parallel between the two processes was observed in cells exposed to high light, starved for sulfate, or treated with norflurazon, a herbicide inducing photooxidative damage by inhibiting de novo carotenoid biosynthesis. When highly illuminated cells were returned to normal light, Cbr decayed in parallel to the reepoxidation of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin. Evidence for the physical association of Cbr and zeaxanthin was provided by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. In cells transferred from low to high light, zeaxanthin was associated with the faster migrating of two electrophoretically resolved fractions of light harvesting complexes of photosystem II that also contained Cbr. In cells growing under normal light, violaxanthin was bound equally to the two fractions. Based on these results we propose that Cbr/early light-induced proteins bind zeaxanthin to form photoprotective complexes within the light-harvesting antennae."
https://openalex.org/W1508650987,"The major subunit of the human asialoglycoprotein receptor contains signals for efficient endocytosis and specific basolateral expression in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, both of which are located within its 40-residue cytoplasmic domain. The aromatic residue in this segment, tyrosine 5, which is necessary for efficient clustering into clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane, is also necessary for exclusive basolateral delivery. Mutation of this residue to alanine resulted in a nonpolar expression of the protein. Replacement of tyrosine 5 with phenylalanine yielded almost wild-type rates of endocytosis as well as specific basolateral expression, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation is not essential for either sorting step. The close similarity between the two sorting signals was further corroborated by deletion mutants showing that the amino-terminal 10 residues of the cytoplasmic domain are sufficient for basolateral polarity and efficient endocytosis. The kinetics of appearance of newly synthesized wild-type and mutant receptor protein at the apical and basolateral surfaces indicate that these proteins are sorted intracellularly and are transported directly to the respective domains. Mutants affected in basolateral sorting lost polarity, i.e, appeared to similar extents on both surfaces, indicating that there is no significant apical sorting information elsewhere in the protein. The close correlation between endocytosis and basolateral polarity suggests common recognition mechanisms at the plasma membrane and in the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W2097310794,"Abstract Meprins are plasma membrane homo- or hetero-oligomeric metalloendopeptidases that contain glycosylated alpha and/or beta subunits. This paper reports the cloning and sequencing of the mouse kidney beta subunit. The primary translation product is composed of 704 amino acids which includes a transient signal sequence of 20 amino acids at the NH2 terminus. The protease domain (Asn-63 to Leu-260) contains the putative zinc-binding motif characteristic of metalloendopeptidases of the astacin family. The COOH terminus contains an epidermal growth factor-like domain, a potential membrane-spanning domain, and an additional 26 amino acids. The beta subunit has an overall 42% identity to the alpha subunit, however, a 56-amino acid segment near the COOH terminus of alpha is missing in beta, and the putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the subunits share no significant sequence similarity. NH2-terminal analyses of detergent-solubilized mature forms revealed that, unlike alpha, the prosequence (Leu-21 to Lys-62) is not removed from the beta subunit. Northern blot analysis revealed a 2.5-kilobase message for the beta subunit in the kidney and intestine of C57BL/6 and C3H/He mice. The gene for the beta subunit was localized to mouse chromosome 18. These studies indicate that alpha and beta probably derived from a common ancestral gene, but have evolved so that their genes are on two different chromosomes, and their tissue-specific expression and post-translational processing differ."
https://openalex.org/W1526657750,"Abstract Thyrotropin (TSH) beta is a subunit of TSH, the expression of which is limited to the thyrotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland. Tissue-specific expression of the mouse TSH beta gene is conferred by sequences between -270 and -80 of the 5'-flanking region. We have investigated tissue-specific expression of the TSH beta promoter in two thyrotrope-derived cell types: 1) TtT-97 thyrotropic tumors, which express the endogenous TSH beta gene, and 2) an alpha-TSH cell line, which was generated from a thyrotropic tumor that has lost the ability to express the TSH beta gene. The pituitary-specific transcription factor Pit-1 is present in thyrotropes and interacts with three cis-acting elements in the functionally important region of the TSH beta promoter. Pit-1 protein is present in TtT-97 tumor cells but is absent from alpha-TSH cells. Reintroduction of Pit-1 into alpha-TSH cells by transient transfection does not restore TSH beta promoter activity. We have identified an alternately spliced variant of Pit-1, called Pit-1T, the mRNA and protein expression of which is limited to thyrotrope-derived cells. Pit-1T contains a 14-amino acid insert in the transactivation domain due to an alternate 3' splice acceptor site. Transiently transfected Pit-1T increases TSH beta promoter activity in TtT-97 thyrotropic tumor cells, whereas additional Pit-1 has no effect. The alpha-TSH cell line, which lacks all Pit-1 proteins, requires both isoforms in order to stimulate TSH beta promoter activity. These data suggest that Pit-1T is a thyrotrope-specific splice variant of Pit-1 that is required for TSH beta promoter stimulation; furthermore, both Pit-1 and Pit-1T are required for TSH beta promoter activity in thyrotrope cells."
https://openalex.org/W1539445430,"The folding of maltose-binding protein, a periplasmic protein in Escherichia coli, was shown to proceed through the same rate-limiting step whether folding occurred in the cell under physiological conditions or in vitro in the absence of other proteins. Four species of maltose-binding protein containing aminoacyl substitutions identified as decreasing the rate of folding of the protein in vivo were purified, and their denaturant-induced folding transitions were analyzed by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of tryptophan. In all four cases the rate of folding in vitro was slower than that of the wild-type maltose-binding protein; thus the same step determines the rate of folding in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, examination of the three-dimensional structure of maltose-binding protein as determined by x-ray crystallography (F. Quiocho, personal communication; Spurlino, J. C., Lu, G.-Y., and Quiocho, F. A. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 5202-5219) indicates that all 4 of the residues identified as crucial to folding lie in one structural element of the native protein. We conclude that the rate-limiting step both in vivo and in vitro involves formation of this element of structure."
https://openalex.org/W1600588308,"Site-directed mutagenesis was used to explore the role of potential proton donors in the mechanism of the Escherichia coli acid phosphatase that is encoded by the appA gene. Asp304 appeared to be the only carboxylic acid residue that is conserved in the protein sequences of the high molecular weight acid phosphatases. The mutations Asp304Ala and Asp304Glu were introduced into appA and the corresponding proteins were overexpressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity. Only small decreases were observed for the Km values of the substrates p-nitrophenyl phosphate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and tripolyphosphate. However, Vmax was greatly decreased, and the magnitude of effect depended markedly on substrate. Both mutant proteins exhibited significantly lower Vmax values with fructose 1,6-diphosphate, which possesses a much poorer leaving group than do the other two substrates. The importance of the leaving group was further tested by using a number of phenyl and alkyl phosphate derivatives as substrates. A linear correlation was observed between log Vmax and the pKa of the substrate leaving group for catalysis by the Asp304Ala mutant enzyme. These results are consistent with partition experiments using ethylene glycol as an alternate nucleophile, which indicated that for the Asp304Ala protein, the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate is the rate-determining step, in contrast to the situation for the wild type enzyme and the His303Ala mutant. In the latter case, the rate-limiting step of the reaction is interpreted to be the breakdown of phosphoenzyme. It is concluded that Asp304, rather than His303, is involved in protonation of the substrate leaving group."
https://openalex.org/W1525853205,"We have identified both biochemically and genetically a protein domain within the simian virus 40 virion protein Vp3, and within Vp2 since its carboxyl two-thirds are identical to the full-length Vp3, that binds DNA in a sequence nonspecific manner. Both the Vp2 and Vp3 (Vp2/3) components of SV40 and mutant SV40(202T) bound either SV40 or pBR322 DNA equally well. Wild type and mutant Vp2/3 proteins, expressed as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (GST), were tested for their ability to bind DNA. GST-Vp3 bound DNA at physiological salt concentrations with an apparent Kd of 2.5 x 10(-8) M and also bound RNA with 4-fold higher affinity. Over 90% of the nucleic acid binding, and all of the activity, was lost upon removal of the carboxyl-terminal 13 and 35 residues, respectively. The DNA binding domain was shown to be distinct and separable from the Vp2/3 nuclear transport signal since mutations within the nuclear transport signal that reduce or abolish nuclear localization of Vp2/3 had no effect on the DNA binding activity of mutant Vp2/3 fusion proteins. The carboxyl-terminal 40 residues of Vp2/3 in the form of a beta-galactosidase fusion protein, F6, are sufficient for DNA binding and may cause compaction of the DNA. The significance of this DNA binding and possible compaction are discussed in relation to the assembly of virion particles."
https://openalex.org/W1544760354,"It has been well established that the biochemical and morphological changes during maturation of granulosa cells that are induced by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) occur through the elevation of intracellular cAMP and consequent activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). In this report we show that FSH action alters the expression of A-Kinase Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs), which function to target the subcellular distribution of the type II PKA. Exposure of granulosa cells grown in primary culture with FSH and estradiol for 72 h resulted in the up-regulation of an 80-kDa AKAP and the RII beta subunit of PKA, whereas cells grown in control medium containing only estradiol produced a time-dependent increase of a 140-kDa AKAP. RII overlays performed with [32P]RII alpha preferentially detected RII-binding bands of 80 and 95 kDa compared to blots probed with [32P]RII beta, suggesting that FSH may alter the subcellular location of PKA in an isoform-specific manner. FSH treatment causes a translocation of RII alpha from the particulate to the cytosolic fraction coincident with the induction of the 80-kDa AKAP, which is also predominately cytosolic. These data suggest that FSH promotes a redistribution of the type II PKA holoenzyme through the selective induction of an RII isoform-specific AKAP."
https://openalex.org/W1514482439,"The p34CDC2 protein kinase is a key component in the regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle. We have isolated from the protozoan parasite Leishmania mexicana mexicana a CDC2-related kinase gene (Lmmcrk1) encoding a 34-kDa protein kinase (lmmCRK1) which has 56% amino acid identity with the human CDC2 and contains a PCTAIR motif in place of the highly conserved PSTAIR box. lmmCRK1 was detected in all life cycle stages at comparable levels, yet its histone H1 kinase activity was detected in only the promastigote form, indicating that its activity is stage-regulated at a post-translational level. lmmCRK1 did not bind p13suc1 beads and Lmmcrk1 was unable to complement a fission yeast temperature-sensitive cdc2 mutant. These data suggest that Lmmcrk1 is unlikely to be the functional L. mexicana cdc2 homologue. A distinct histone H1 kinase activity that binds p13suc1 beads (SBCRK) was also detected, with activity that correlated with the division status of the developmental forms of the parasite, being present in the dividing stages of the parasite and absent in nondividing metacyclic forms. SBCRK is a candidate for the functional CDC2 homologue, but it does not react with an anti-PSTAIR monoclonal antibody on Western blots when eluted from p13suc1 beads, indicating a divergent PSTAIR box. These data suggest that a family of CDC2-related protein kinases are present in Leishmania. Some share sequence and biochemical properties with CDC2, but significant differences also exist, possibly reflecting the evolutionary distance between Leishmania and higher eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1490006539,"To identify sequences responsible for the muscle-specific expression of the rat GLUT4/muscle-fat gene, we examined the transcriptional regulation of this gene in the differentiating murine C2C12 skeletal muscle cell line. Differentiated myofibers displayed a 4-5-fold increase in GLUT4 mRNA compared with undifferentiated myoblasts which paralleled the conversion from non-muscle beta-actin mRNA to muscle-specific alpha-actin mRNA expression. Transient transfection of progressive 5' and 3' deletions of the GLUT4 5'-flanking DNA identified a 281-base pair region located between -517 and -237 relative to the transcription start site which conferred myotube-specific expression. This region increased reporter activity in the context of the GLUT4 minimal promoter in an orientation-independent manner and, in addition, onto the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter. Myotube-specific expression of both GLUT4 reporter constructs and the endogenous mouse GLUT4 mRNA was also observed to be thyroid hormone-dependent. Further, cotransfection of reporter constructs containing the 281-base pair GLUT4 differentiation-specific enhancer with the thyroid hormone receptor specifically increased luciferase activity in myotubes approximately 12-fold. Thus, these data demonstrate the presence of a proximal skeletal muscle-specific activation domain that is necessary for both myotube-specific GLUT4 expression and thyroid hormone responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W1505996156,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion by isolated rat hepatocytes was dependent on addition of oleate to the incubation medium and inhibited in hepatocytes isolated from livers of orotic acid-fed rats (OA hepatocytes). To investigate the intracellular transit of newly synthesized apoB under different conditions, normal hepatocytes (with or without oleate) or OA hepatocytes (with oleate) were incubated with [35S]methionine, and subcellular fractions (rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, cis-Golgi, and trans-Golgi and membrane and lumenal contents from these) were isolated at intervals. The specific activities and pool sizes of apoB100 and apoB48 were determined. The observations indicate that there are several points at which intracellular transit of apoB is regulated. Newly synthesized apoB is either translocated to the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum or remains membrane bound and is degraded. The lumenal apoB is either retained and degraded or transferred to the Golgi lumen and secreted. In OA hepatocytes degradation of the membrane-bound form of apoB is inhibited, and the protein accumulates in the trans-Golgi membranes. Although apoB is translocated to the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum in OA hepatocytes, it is not packaged with lipid and is transferred to the Golgi lumen only slowly."
https://openalex.org/W1504145802,"Rat parvalbumin (PV), an EF-hand type Ca(2+)-binding protein, was expressed in Escherichia coli and mutated by replacing a Phe at position 102 with a unique Trp in order to introduce a distinct fluorescent label into the protein. Mass spectroscopy and NMR data indicate that the recombinant wild-type (PVWT) and F102W mutant (PVF102W) proteins have the expected molecular weight and retain the native structure. Both proteins contain two non-cooperative Ca2+/Mg(2+)-binding sites with intrinsic affinity constants, KCa and KMg, of 2.4 +/- 0.9 x 10(7) M-1 and of 2.9 +/- 0.2 x 10(4) M-1, respectively, for PVWT, and KCa and KMg, of 2.7 +/- 1.1 x 10(7) M-1 and of 4.4 +/- 0.3 x 10(4) M-1, respectively, for PVF102W. Based on the highly similar metal binding properties of PVWT and PVF102W the latter protein was used to study cation-dependent conformational changes. Trp fluorescence emission and UV difference spectra of PVF102W indicated that the Trp residue at position 102 is confined to a hydrophobic core and conformationally strongly restricted. Upon Ca2+ or Mg2+ binding the structural organization of the region around the Trp is hardly affected, but there are significant changes in its electrostatic environment. The conformational change upon binding of Ca2+ and Mg2+, as monitored by UV difference spectrophotometry, increases linearly from 0 to 2 cations bound, indicating that the binding of both ions contributes equally to the structural organization in this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1900995848,"Hormone binding to receptors on the cell surface triggers a sequence of events (receptor activation and signal generation) leading to activation of effectors in the cytoplasm. Receptor activation and signal generation are difficult to study as both are intimately associated with hormone binding. The lutropin-choriogonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor offers a unique model to differentiate and examine receptor activation and signal generation from hormone binding. It belongs to a subfamily of glycoprotein hormone receptors within the G-protein-coupled receptor family. This receptor subfamily has several structural features different from the structures of other G-protein-coupled receptors. These receptors consist of a large extracellular N-terminal half and membrane-associated C-terminal half of similar size. The truncated N-terminal half alone is capable of high affinity hormone binding, whereas the truncated C-terminal half alone is capable of low affinity hormone binding and cAMP induction. However, this distinction between the high affinity hormone binding and low affinity hormone binding associated with cAMP induction has not been established in intact receptors. As a step to identify a structural element which is responsible for receptor activation and signal generation, we have identified an extracellular Asp of the C-terminal half of the LH/CG receptor which is unique and common to the glycoprotein hormone receptors. Evidence is presented for the first time that Asp397 is important for induction of cAMP synthesis but not essential for hormone binding. Since extracellular Asp397 cannot interact with G-protein in the cytoplasm, the inability of the mutant LH/CG receptors with an Asp397 substitution to induce cAMP synthesis is likely to be caused by a defect in the intermediate steps (receptor activation and signal generation) between hormone binding and activation of G-protein. Therefore, our results not only demonstrate that receptor activation and signal generation are distinct from high affinity hormone binding in intact LH/CG receptors, but they also identify an amino acid important for the processes."

https://openalex.org/W1586862074,"The crystal structure of recombinant rat prostatic acid phosphatase in complex with the inhibitor L(+)-tartrate was determined to 3-A resolution with protein crystallographic methods. The inhibitor binds at the carboxyl end of the parallel strands of the alpha/beta domain. One of the carboxyl groups of the tartrate molecule interacts with the conserved residues Arg-11, His-12, and Arg-15, which form part of the phosphate binding site. Furthermore, the C2 and C3 hydroxyl groups interact with His-257 and Arg-79. The second carboxyl group is close to Arg-79 but makes no direct hydrogen bonds to the protein. A sequence comparison between tartrate-sensitive and -resistant acid phosphatases suggests that these enzymes have different three-dimensional structures."
https://openalex.org/W1526096964,"Both high and low affinity binding sites for [3H]ryanodine exist in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes derived from rabbit skeletal muscle. Negatively cooperative binding of [3H]ryanodine at one of four initially identical sites cannot account for some of the kinetic features of the binding to high and low affinity sites. The presence of excess unlabeled ryanodine greatly slows the rate at which [3H]ryanodine bound at the high affinity site dissociates. An examination of the rate of dissociation of [3H]ryanodine bound at increasing [3H]ryanodine concentrations reveals the existence of a second site, occupied only at high ligand concentrations. The occupation of this site correlates well with the conversion of the high affinity site from a site with a dissociation rate constant of approximately 0.0025 min-1 to one with a dissociation rate constant of less than 0.00025 min-1. The low affinity site itself has a dissociation rate constant of 0.013 min-1 and dissociation from this site is unaffected by the presence of 100 microM unlabeled ryanodine. These data suggest that the two binding sites are different but are either allosterically or sterically coupled. Association experiments support this interpretation. Low affinity binding sites for [3H]ryanodine exist in transverse tubule (t-tubule) as well as sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes. High concentrations of both ryanodine and ruthenium red inhibit the binding of [3H]PN200-110 to the dihydropyridine-binding protein in t-tubule membranes. Whether the low affinity site in t-tubule membranes is related to that found in sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes is not yet known."
https://openalex.org/W1604063634,"Numerous studies on the molecular basis of the mechanism of action of fatty acids have demonstrated their action in cell signaling and particularly on the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Stimulation of Jurkat T cells with CD3 monoclonal antibody results in an increase of intracellular calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i due both to a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and a Ca2+ influx. [Ca2+]i increase represents a dynamic balance between Ca2+ influx and efflux. Fatty acids, either saturated (C14:0), monounsaturated (C16:1), or polyunsaturated, belonging to the C18 and the C20 series induce a marked decrease of CD3-induced [Ca2+]i rise. This property of fatty acid is independent of the position of the carbon-carbon double bond but specific of the cis stereoisomeric form. Fatty acids does not block CD3-induced signals but greatly stimulates the Ca2+ extrusion process probably by activating the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-ATPase. This was documented by the observation that fatty acids, reduced to the same extent as [Ca2+]i, elicited either with CD3 monoclonal antibody the calcium ionophore ionomycin or the Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin."
https://openalex.org/W1547995942,"The irreversible thermal denaturation of the F1 portion of the chloroplast ATP synthase (CF1) was examined by differential scanning calorimetry, ATPase activity loss, and release of bound nucleotides. In nearly all cases, the loss of ATPase activity closely paralleled the temperature dependence of the excess heat capacity. Although the irreversible nature of the denaturation precluded thermodynamic interpretation, a kinetic analysis was feasible. A two-state kinetic model was found to fit the calorimetric data very well. The activation energies of thermal denaturation calculated from calorimetric data were very close to those determined from Arrhenius plots of the apparent first-order rate constants of loss of ATPase activity versus reciprocal of the temperature. The nucleotide binding site occupancy profoundly influenced the temperature at which thermal denaturation occurred. In particular, the temperature at which the maximum in excess heat capacity occurs (Tm) was increased about 8 degrees C by occupancy of tight, noncatalytic ATP binding sites and by an additional 3-4 degrees C by the presence of nucleotides in the medium during heating. The thermal denaturation of CF1, an enzyme composed of nine polypeptide chains, is highly cooperative in that it obeys the simple two-step kinetic model. Since the removal of the epsilon and delta subunits has little effect on thermal denaturation, the major forces that stabilize CF1 must, thus, be between the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1549620906,"Abstract To characterize the association of the mRNA for apoprotein B (apoB) with ribosomes, rat hepatic cytoplasmic extracts were fractionated by density gradient centrifugation. On linear sucrose gradients, the sedimentation velocity of the 14.4-kilobase apoB mRNA was retarded compared to the mRNAs for other hepatic proteins, which were concentrated in fractions containing the bulk of the polysomes. This unusual distribution of apoB mRNA could not be explained by cotranslational association of nascent apoB peptides with lipids, based on experiments using either detergents to delipidate proteins or puromycin to release nascent peptides from polysomes. The results were also not the result of the editing of apoB mRNA, since the sucrose gradient distributions of both edited and nonedited forms were similar. In contrast, the distribution of a 3'-truncated apoB mRNA (apoB-42, 5.8 kilobases) expressed in rat hepatoma cells resembled that of mRNA of a typical hepatic protein. As opposed to the sedimentation velocity results, on equilibrium density gradients most hepatic apoB mRNA was found in the fraction that contained polysomes. Based on these data, the elongation rate of nascent apoB, and the calculated translational yield of apoB mRNA, we conclude that the majority of rat hepatic apoB mRNA must be part of polysomal complexes with unusual physical properties related to the presence of sequence(s) in the 3'-region of the message. These sequences may either be primary determinants of structural features or binding sites for protein factors that effect conformational changes."
https://openalex.org/W1503277131,"Sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were treated with 2 mM pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) at 25 degrees C and pH 7.0 for 6 min and reduced by NaBH4. Both the activity of the Ca(2+)-ATPase and the capacity for high affinity Mg-ATP binding were greatly reduced. Acetyl phosphate hydrolysis or phosphoenzyme formation from Pi was not inhibited. The enzyme was protected by high affinity Mg-ATP binding against the PLP-induced inhibition. A similar protective effect was obtained by Mg-AMP as well as by Mg-ADP. Acetyl phosphate or Pi gave no protection. The PLP-treated vesicles were solubilized in SDS, and the Ca(2+)-ATPase was purified by size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mapping the fluorescently labeled peptides in the tryptic digest by reversed phase HPLC revealed a single fluorescent peak, which was protected by Mg-ATP against labeling. Sequencing showed that Lys-492 is the residue labeled with PLP. These results demonstrate that Lys-492 is located in or near the ATP binding site but not in the phosphorylation site or the Pi binding site. When Lys-515 was entirely prelabeled with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC), the subsequent labeling of Lys-492 with PLP was not prevented. This finding demonstrates that Lys-492 is located outside the FITC-binding region. It has been widely accepted that FITC occupies the adenosine-binding region within the ATP binding site. In contrast to FITC, Mg-AMP strongly inhibited the labeling of Lys-492 with PLP. These findings lead to the conclusion that Lys-492 is located outside the adenosine-binding region, most probably in or near the region occupied by the alpha-phosphoryl group of Mg-ATP bound to the ATP binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1547200966,"A mutant of the Escherichia coli F1-ATPase, gamma S8C, has been reacted with a novel bifunctional reagent, N-maleimido-N'-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzamido) cystamine (TFPAM-SS1). Modification of Cys-8 via the maleimide, followed by photolysis to convert the azido group to a reactive nitrene, led to cross-linking of the gamma subunit to a beta subunit. When this cross-linking was conducted with ADP + Mg2+ in catalytic sites, the predominant cross-linked product had a M(r) of 108,000. If cross-linking was done with uncleaved ATP + Mg2+ in catalytic sites, cross-linked products of 102,000 and 84,000 were formed. Cross-linking under both conditions led to inhibition of ATPase activity. TFPAM-SS1 could be cleaved by using reducing agents to break the disulfide bond that links the malemide and tetrafluorophenylazide moieties. Cleavage of this disulfide bond after formation of 102,000 and 84,000 species led to full recovery of ATPase activity. When the 108-kDa cross-linked product was cleaved, full activity was not restored, presumably because of insertion of the tetrafluorophenylazide into a functionally important site on the beta subunit. After cleavage of the disulfide bond, the free thiols could be reacted with [14C]N-ethylmaleimide, thereby radioactively tagging the sites of insertion of the tetrafluorophenylnitrene moiety. In this way, the site of cross-linking from Cys-8 of gamma to the beta subunit in the presence of ADP + Mg2+ was localized to within the sequence Val 145-Lys-155, which contains the glycine-rich loop. This loop region is a part of the catalytic site of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1607984740,"The structure of the type III variant of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reveals that Thr-174, a conserved residue, is hydrogen-bonded to a bound water molecule (water 252). Modeling studies (P. C. E. Moody and A. G. W. Leslie, unpublished data) suggested that water 252 could play a part in transition state stabilization via a hydrogen bond to the oxyanion of the putative tetrahedral intermediate. In addition, water 252 is one of three bound water molecules hydrogen-bonded to the 1-hydroxyl group of chloramphenicol in the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase-chloramphenicol binary complex. A combination of site-directed mutagenesis and the use of an alternative substrate has allowed the quantitation of the energetic contribution of each of the interactions made by water 252 to catalysis. Thr-174 was replaced by alanine, valine, and isoleucine, each substitution removing the hydroxyl group hydrogen-bonded to water 252. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the mutant enzymes was carried out using both chloramphenicol and 1-deoxy-chloramphenicol as acetyl acceptors. The substitutions at Thr-174 result in a fall in kcat and in decreased affinities for each acetyl acceptor in the binary complexes and also in the ternary complexes with acetyl-CoA. From the calculated free energies in the transition state, the hydrogen bond between water 252 and the oxyanion of the tetrahedral intermediate can be estimated to contribute 0.9 kcal mol-1 toward transition state stabilization, whereas the free energy of the hydrogen bonds between the 1-hydroxyl of chloramphenicol and three bound water molecules provides 1.6 kcal mol-1."

Single cell intracellular Ca2+ responses to Pg and u-PA were studied using Fura-2 and digital imaging fluorescence microscopy. Pg activation by u-PA on the surface of RA synovial fibroblasts induces a significant rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) within 90 s. Pg kringle 4 and the alpha 2,3-linked sialic acid in the carbohydrate chain bound to Thr245 are involved in mediating the increases in [Ca2+]i. This response is not observed in normal synovial fibroblasts, suggesting that RA synovial fibroblasts have altered responses to the binding and activation of Pg on their surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2123685315,"Calbindin-D28K, a member of the troponin C superfamily of calcium-binding proteins, had six putative EF hand domains containing one very high affinity and two to three lower affinity calcium-binding sites. The location and binding activity of the calcium-binding sites were examined with a recombinant calbindin-D28K protein. This protein (Calb I-II) only contained EF hand domains 1 and 2 of calbindin-D28K. Binding of calcium and calcium analogs, the lanthanides, by the recombinant protein was determined in fluorescence emission experiments. Calb I-II bound 1 mol of terbium/mol of protein. Terbium was displaced from Calb I-II by other lanthanides and calcium. Fluorescence from terbium was not quenched by holmium. These results and Hill plots of calcium binding activity, determined from intrinsic protein fluorescence measurements, indicated the presence of a single high affinity calcium-binding site on Calb I-II. The properties of the binding site indicated that the very high affinity site of calbindin-D28K was located in EF hand domains 1 and 2 of the protein. In addition, these findings indicated the NH2-terminal pair of EF hands in calbindin-D28K did not depend on interactions with other domains in the protein for high affinity calcium binding activity. The results suggested at least one calcium-binding domain of calbindin-D28K can exist as an independent EF hand pair."
https://openalex.org/W1533610915,"Using ion exchange chromatography and an ATP-dependent actin precipitation step, we have isolated three myosin-I isozymes that, together, account for most of the K+EDTA-ATPase activity recovered from extracts of Dictyostelium. The two major myosin-I isozymes, present in approximately equal amounts, had apparent molecular masses of 125 kDa on SDS gels and have been identified by amino acid sequence analysis as the products of the Dictyostelium myosin-IB (DMIB) and myosin-ID (DMID) genes. DMIB, with a specific K+EDTA-ATPase activity 10-fold higher than DMID, was responsible for most of the activity in cell extracts. The third isozyme, present in low amounts, had an apparent molecular mass of 137 kDa on SDS gels and is too large to be the product of any of the known myosin-I genes. DMIB eluted from DE53 cellulose columns as two distinct peaks (II and III). Addition of the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid to the extraction buffer increased the fraction of DMIB recovered from growth phase cells in peak III from 35 to 70%. DMIB isolated from peak III, but not from peak II, displayed a significant level of actin-activated MgATPase activity. These results indicate that peak III represents a phosphorylated, actin-activatable form of DMIB."
https://openalex.org/W1672557857,"One- and two-dimensional NMR techniques were used to compare the structural consequences of Ca2+ binding to both the low and high affinity Ca2+ binding sites in recombinant cardiac troponin C (cTnC3). In the absence of Ca2+, the short beta-sheet located between the high affinity Ca2+/Mg2+ binding sites in the C-terminal domain was found to be absent or loosely formed as judged by the inter-residue NOEs and chemical shifts of resonances in the Ca2+ binding loops. In contrast, the N-terminal domain beta-sheet located between site II and the naturally inactive site I was present even in the absence of bound Ca2+. Calcium-binding mutant proteins having either an inactive Ca2+ binding site III (CBM-III) or an inactive Ca2+ binding site IV (CBM-IV) (Negele, J. C., Dotson, D., Liu, W., Sweeney, H. L., and Putkey, J. A. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 825-831) were used to study the structural consequences of Ca2+ binding to each of the high affinity sites located in the C-terminal domain. Only a single active Ca2+ binding site was found necessary for formation of the short beta-sheet between Ca2+ binding sites III and IV. However, the absence of bound Ca2+ at site III was found to produce greater instability in the C-terminal domain as judged from the mobility of the C-terminal aromatic hydrophobic cluster. Thus, Ca2+ binding to the high affinity sites in the C-terminal domain results in an ordering of the aromatic hydrophobic cluster, as well as formation of a short beta-sheet between Ca2+ binding sites III and IV. These results demonstrate that Ca2+ binding plays distinctive structural roles in the N- and C-terminal domains of cTnC."
https://openalex.org/W1496877550,"We asked whether cyclo(His-Pro) may arise from a substance other than the initially found progenitor thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Incubation of TRH-Gly (pGlu-His-Pro-Gly), a TRH precursor, with brain hypothalamic cytosols caused significant formation of His-Pro-Gly followed by the generation of histidyl-proline diketopiperazine (cyclo(His-Pro)), whereas TRH was not formed. The addition of purified pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase resulted in the transformation of TRH-Gly to His-Pro-Gly and cyclo (His-Pro) but not to TRH. Neither TRH nor cyclo(His-Pro) was produced from TRH-Gly in the presence of alpha-amidating enzyme under the present conditions. Nonenzymatic conversion of His-Pro-Gly to cyclo(His-Pro) occurred. The present results provide evidence that cyclo(His-Pro) can emanate from a direct predecessor form of TRH by pyroglutamyl aminopeptidase action, not through TRH formation."
https://openalex.org/W1580330438,"Glutamine 170 to tyrosine mutation in the beta-subunit from Schizosaccharomyces pombe mitochondrial F1 was found to increase both affinity for ADP, apparent negative cooperativity of ATPase activity, and sensitivity to azide inhibition (Falson, P., Di Pietro, A., Jault, J.-M., Gautheron, D.C., and Boutry, M. (1989) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 975, 119-126). The mutation is shown here to increase the affinity for GDP, IDP, and guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imidotriphosphate), which are competitive inhibitors of GTPase and ITPase activities. Various fluorescence approaches also reveal an increased affinity of the catalytic site in mutant as compared with wild-type enzyme for GDP, IDP, and 2'(3')-N-methylanthraniloyl GDP. The mutation alters the maximal rates and pH dependence of GTPase and ITPase activities, whereas wild-type F1 exhibits single optima at pH 7.5-8.0. The pH activity profiles of the mutant enzyme for these substrates are biphasic, with optima at pH 8.5-9.0 and below 6.5. The mutation increases the sensitivity of GTPase and ITPase activities to azide inhibition, which increases with decreasing pH. At pH 6.0-7.0, an apparent negative cooperativity is observed when mutant F1 hydrolyzes GTP or ITP, whereas the wild-type enzyme shows Michaelian kinetics. Addition of bicarbonate at pH 7.0 substantially stimulates GTP or ITP hydrolysis and abolishes the apparent negative cooperativity by the mutant enzyme; on the contrary, the anion produces a slight inhibition of these activities catalyzed by wild-type F1. The overall results suggest that apparent negative cooperativity can be observed with GTP or ITP hydrolysis provided that the release of the respective diphosphate is a rate-limiting step."

The nitrogen-fixing site within the molybdenum-iron protein is an iron-molybdenum-sulfur cofactor (FeMoco) of roughly 1000-2000 Dalton mass. Structural aspects of FeMoco have been determined by spectroscopic and more recently by crystallographic studies. In order to determine the radius of gyration (Rg) of isolated FeMoco, we have performed small-angle x-ray scattering studies of FeMoco in N-methylformamide solution, in the absence of the molybdenum-iron protein. Model compounds of known structure have also been examined in similar solvents, N,N-dimethylformamide and acetonitrile, as controls and for calibration purposes. The Rg values obtained for the models are in good agreement with calculations based upon their respective crystal structures. However, the Rg obtained for FeMoco clearly indicates that the cofactor is not monomeric in solution, but rather aggregated and possibly polydisperse. Further, Rg values were also measured after addition of thiol, dithionite, and thiol and dithionite, to the FeMoco samples. The results indicate, surprisingly, that oxidation state and putative thiol coordination have no detectable effect on the aggregation behavior of FeMoco in solution, as determined by these measurements."
https://openalex.org/W1542149771,"Elongation factor eEF-2 from rat liver, which contains 7 tryptophan residues, was treated with increasing concentrations of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) under conditions in which these residues were oxidized specifically. The reagent produced a characteristic lowering in both the absorbance at 280 nm and the intrinsic fluorescence at 332 nm of the factor. Fluorometric titration of tryptophans and correlation to eEF-2 residual activity on GTP hydrolysis and polyphenylalanine synthesis showed that modification of the two most reactive tryptophans completely inactivated the factor. These residues were identified as Trp343 and Trp221 after cleavage of the protein with cyanogen bromide, separation of the fragments by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography, and N-terminal sequencing of the two fragments which exhibited a decreased absorbance in the NBS-treated protein. Oxidation of the most reactive residue, Trp343, did not induce significant decrease of activity of the factor or of its ability to interact with GTP or GDP. On the contrary, oxidation of Trp221 inactivated the factor, whose residual fluorescence was still partly quenched by GDP but no longer by GTP. Preincubation of eEF-2 with GDP protected Trp221 against NBS oxidation and prevented concomitant inactivation of the factor, whereas preincubation of eEF-2 with GTP increased the sensitivity of the same Trp221 residue to the reagent. Our results show for the first time that Trp221, which is conserved and belongs to a well preserved domain in eukaryotic cells and archaebacteria, plays an essential part in the catalytic activity of eEF-2. They strongly suggest that GTP induces a conformational change of the protein which unmasks this residue, whereas GDP stabilizes a conformation which makes this residue much less accessible."
https://openalex.org/W1603419527,"Two-dimensional, rotational-echo double-resonance 13C NMR, a new solid-state NMR technique, has been used to show that the relative fluxes of the labeled chemical bond of L-[2-13C,15N]serine along four metabolic pathways (direct purine synthesis, direct glycine incorporation into protein, direct non-glycyl incorporation into protein, and nitrogen scrambling with loss of carbon) are 1:2:6:36, respectively, for Klebsiella pneumoniae under conditions of nitrogenase derepression. These determinations were performed on a single sample of lyophilized, double-labeled, intact cells. Analysis of the homogeneity of the distribution of label suggests that the primary role of serine in shortening derepression is in providing specific carbon and nitrogen for RNA synthesis."
