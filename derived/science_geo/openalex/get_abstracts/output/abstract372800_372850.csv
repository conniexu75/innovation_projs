https://openalex.org/W1998563859,"The Hippo pathway regulates proliferation and survival in Drosophila and mammals, although shared transcriptional targets of their effectors have not been identified. Mammalian YAP controls expression of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin to regulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in mammary epithelial cells, and the EGFR pathway genetically interacts with Yorkie in Drosophila. The Hippo signalling pathway regulates cellular proliferation and survival, thus has profound effects on normal cell fate and tumorigenesis1,2,3. The pivotal effector of this pathway is YAP (yes-associated protein), a transcriptional co-activator amplified in mouse and human cancers, where it promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant transformation4,5,6,7,8,9,10. So far, studies of YAP target genes have focused on cell-autonomous mediators; here we show that YAP-expressing MCF10A breast epithelial cells enhance the proliferation of neighbouring untransfected cells, implicating a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. We identify the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand amphiregulin (AREG) as a transcriptional target of YAP, whose induction contributes to YAP-mediated cell proliferation and migration, but not EMT. Knockdown of AREG or addition of an EGFR kinase inhibitor abrogates the proliferative effects of YAP expression. Suppression of the negative YAP regulators LATS1 and 2 (large tumour suppressor 1 and 2) is sufficient to induce AREG expression, consistent with physiological regulation of AREG by the Hippo pathway. Genetic interaction between the Drosophila YAP orthologue Yorkie and Egfr signalling components supports the link between these two highly conserved signalling pathways. Thus, YAP-dependent secretion of AREG indicates that activation of EGFR signalling is an important non-cell-autonomous effector of the Hippo pathway, which has implications for the regulation of both physiological and malignant cell proliferation."

https://openalex.org/W2065137093,"A variant 35 kb upstream of the HLA-C gene (-35C/T) was previously shown to associate with HLA-C mRNA expression level and steady-state plasma HIV RNA levels. We genotyped this variant in 1,698 patients of European ancestry with HIV. Individuals with known seroconversion dates were used for disease progression analysis and those with longitudinal viral load data were used for viral load analysis. We further tested cell surface expression of HLA-C in normal donors using an HLA-C-specific antibody. We show that the -35C allele is a proxy for high HLA-C cell surface expression, and that individuals with high-expressing HLA-C alleles progress more slowly to AIDS and control viremia significantly better than individuals with low HLA-C expressing alleles. These data strongly implicate high HLA-C expression levels in more effective control of HIV-1, potentially through better antigen presentation to cytotoxic T lymphocytes or recognition and killing of infected cells by natural killer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071141381,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) controls fundamental cellular functions, including cell fate decisions. In PC12, cells shifting ERK activation from transient to sustained induces neuronal differentiation. As ERK associates with both regulators and effectors, we hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying the switch could be revealed by assessing the dynamic changes in ERK-interacting proteins that specifically occur under differentiation conditions. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified 284 ERK-interacting proteins. Upon induction of differentiation, 60 proteins changed their binding to ERK, including many proteins that were not known to participate in differentiation. We functionally characterized a subset, showing that they regulate the pathway at several levels and by different mechanisms, including signal duration, ERK localization, feedback, crosstalk with the Akt pathway and differential interaction and phosphorylation of transcription factors. Integrating these data with a mathematical model confirmed that ERK dynamics and differentiation are regulated by distributed control mechanisms rather than by a single master switch."
https://openalex.org/W2076228191,"The nuclear envelope (NE) LINC complex, in mammals comprised of SUN domain and nesprin proteins, provides a direct connection between the nuclear lamina and the cytoskeleton, which contributes to nuclear positioning and cellular rigidity. SUN1 and SUN2 interact with lamin A, but lamin A is only required for NE localization of SUN2, and it remains unclear how SUN1 is anchored. Here, we identify emerin and short nesprin-2 isoforms as novel nucleoplasmic binding partners of SUN1/2. These have overlapping binding sites distinct from the lamin A binding site. However, we demonstrate that tight association of SUN1 with the nuclear lamina depends upon a short motif within residues 209–228, a region that does not interact significantly with known SUN1 binding partners. Moreover, SUN1 localizes correctly in cells lacking emerin. Importantly then, the major determinant of SUN1 NE localization has yet to be identified. We further find that a subset of lamin A mutations, associated with laminopathies Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), disrupt lamin A interaction with SUN1 and SUN2. Despite this, NE localization of SUN1 and SUN2 is not impaired in cell lines from either class of patients. Intriguingly, SUN1 expression at the NE is instead enhanced in a significant proportion of HGPS but not EDMD cells and strongly correlates with pre-lamin A accumulation due to preferential interaction of SUN1 with pre-lamin A. We propose that these different perturbations in lamin A-SUN protein interactions may underlie the opposing effects of EDMD and HGPS mutations on nuclear and cellular mechanics.

SUN domain-containing proteins are an evolutionarily conserved family of proteins that share a conserved C-terminal SUN domain (1Malone C.J. Fixsen W.D. Horvitz H.R. Han M.

Thus, the LINC complex provides a direct connection between the nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton, which is believed to contribute to cellular rigidity (11Houben F. Ramaekers F.C. Snoeckx L.H.

Giant nesprin-1 and nesprin-2 isoforms localize to the ONM where they mediate connection with the actin cytoskeleton via an N-terminal actin binding domain. On the other hand, shorter isoforms such as nesprin-1α and nesprin-2α are thought to be located primarily on the nucleoplasmic face of the INM. Isoforms lacking the KASH domain, such as nesprin-2αΔTM, may also reside within the nucleoplasm. In support of their INM localization, nesprin-1α and nesprin-2α both interact with lamin A/C and the INM protein emerin (19Mislow J.M. Holaska J.M. Kim M.S. Lee K.K. Segura-Totten M. Wilson K.L.

The most prominent examples are lamins A and C, encoded by the LMNA gene, which are mutated in a range of disorders, termed laminopathies (for review, see Ref. 21Worman H.J. Bonne G. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 2121-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Laminopathies encompass apparently disparate phenotypes that primarily affect tissues of mesenchymal origin. Among these diseases are the fat-wasting disorder, familial partial lipodystrophy, Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), and the devastating premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS). EDMD is also linked to mutations in the STA gene (encoding emerin) and the SYNE-1 and SYNE-2 genes (encoding nesprin-1 and nesprin-2, respectively) (22Bione S. Maestrini E. Rivella S. Mancini M. Regis S. Romeo G. Toniolo D. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 23Zhang Q. Bethmann C. Worth N.F. Davies J.D. Wasner C. Feuer A. Ragnauth C.D. Yi Q. Mellad J.A.

Genet. 2007; 16: 2816-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The fact that these proteins all interact with each other supports a common disease mechanism, which is likely to be related to weakening of the nucleoskeleton and its links with the cytoskeleton (12Stewart-Hutchinson P.J. Hale C.M. Wirtz D. Hodzic D. Exp. Cell Res. 2008; 314: 1892-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Broers J.L. Peeters E.A. Kuijpers H.J. Endert J. Bouten C.V. Oomens C.W. Baaijens F.P.

On the other hand, HGPS and related progeroid phenotypes can also be caused by mutations in the ZMPSTE24 gene, which encodes an enzyme involved in the proteolytic processing of pre-lamin A (27Agarwal A.K.

Findings from several studies suggest that it is persistence of a lamin A processing intermediate in HGPS that has a dominant-negative effect on nuclear structure and functions (for review, see Ref. 31Davies B.S. Fong L.G. Yang S.H. Coffinier C. Young S.G. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2009; 10: 153-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the most noticeable defect being aberrant nuclear morphology (32Goldman R.D. Shumaker D.K. Erdos M.R. Eriksson M. Goldman A.E.

In addition to their role in nucleo-cytoskeletal connections, mammalian SUN proteins have more recently been implicated in chromatin binding and are reported to anchor telomeres at the nuclear periphery during meiosis (33Chi Y.H. Haller K. Peloponese Jr., J.M. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27447-27458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 34Xiong H. Rivero F. Euteneuer U. Mondal S.

Cell. 2007; 12: 863-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The importance of this tethering is indicated by the finding that SUN1 knock-out mice are infertile due to an inability to complete meiosis (36Ding X. Xu R. Yu J. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Han M. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 863-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Similar findings have also been made in yeast (37Chikashige Y. Tsutsumi C. Yamane M. Okamasa K. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Cell. 2006; 125: 59-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 38Oza P. Jaspersen S.L. Miele A. Dekker J. Peterson C.L.

Gehlen L.R. Gasser S.M. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 928-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). SUN proteins are, thus, likely to play important roles in nuclear architecture and chromatin dynamics. Although the luminal C termini of SUN1 and SUN2 are highly conserved, the nucleoplasmic N termini are more divergent, and the SUN1 NTD is significantly larger than that of SUN2. RNAi studies have revealed that there is redundancy in SUN1/2 function with respect to anchoring of nesprins at the ONM, but other studies suggest that they also have distinct properties (3Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 4Haque F. Lloyd D.J. Smallwood D.T. Dent C.L. Shanahan C.M. Fry A.M. Trembath R.C. Shackleton S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3738-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Both SUN1 and SUN2 have been shown to interact with lamin A, yet SUN1 remains localized at the NE in the absence of lamin A/C, whereas SUN2 largely does not. In addition, exogenously expressed SUN1 constructs can displace SUN2 from the NE, whereas the reverse is not true, suggesting that INM binding sites for SUN2 are more easily saturated than those for SUN1 (3Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Together, this information indicates that SUN1 has additional nuclear binding partners, whereas SUN2 is dependent on the presence of lamin A. Here we have examined the mechanism by which SUN proteins are anchored at the NE in mammalian cells. We identify emerin and short nesprin-2 isoforms as novel binding partners of both SUN1 and SUN2. Furthermore, we find that SUN protein interactions are perturbed in EDMD and HGPS, suggesting that SUN1 and SUN2 play a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. pCI-mSUN1, pCMVTag3-mSUN1-(355–913), pCDNA3-emerin, pEGFP-nesprin-2, and pCI-LMNA mammalian expression constructs have been described previously (4Haque F.

Additional pCMVTag3-mSUN1 deletion constructs were generated by PCR amplification of the relevant region of the cDNA using pCI-mSUN1 as template followed by ligation into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pCMVTag3B. SUN1-integrin β1 chimeric constructs were then generated by ligation of PCR-amplified integrin β1 cDNA, corresponding to residues 726–798, into the SalI and ApaI sites of the relevant pCMVTag3-mSUN1 plasmids. MBP-fused pMAL-SUN1-(1–355) and GST-fused emerin-(1–221) bacterial expression plasmids have been described previously (4Haque F. Lloyd D.J. Smallwood D.T. Dent C.L. Shanahan C.M. Fry A.M. Trembath R.C. Shackleton S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3738-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). GST-fused mSUN1 and mSUN2 constructs were generated by PCR amplification of the relevant regions using pCI-mSUN1 and IMAGE clone 6827666 as templates, respectively, and ligation into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T3. pTnT-nesprin-2βΔTM was generated by reverse transcription-PCR amplification from human cDNA using the primers 5′-GTGAACTCATATGGCCATGGAGCGGCGCATGGAAAT-3′ and 5′-AGATCTATGGATCCCGCTGTGGCCGTGTGCTGCC-3′. These primers incorporated an NdeI site at the first methionine and a BamHI-stop-BglII restriction site at the 3′ end of the cDNA, allowing both C- and N-terminal histidine tagging at a later stage. The amplicon was “A-tailed” and cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Invitrogen), and the insert was verified by sequencing. To clone the nesprin-2β cDNA into the pTnT vector (Promega), the gene was amplified from pGEM-T Easy-Nesprin-2βΔTM using 5′-GGTACCGCCGCCACCATGGCCATGGAGCGGCGCAT-3′ and an SP6 primer. The product was then cloned into the KpnI-NotI sites in pTnT. AP8 emerin and mouse SUN1 affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit antibodies have been described previously (4Haque F. Lloyd D.J.

Morris (Center for Inherited Neuromuscular Disease, Oswestry, UK), respectively. Sheep emerin antibodies and Myc-tag antibodies were obtained from ImmuQuest and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Mouse monoclonal α-tubulin and β-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Hemagglutinin tag, goat lamin A/C (6215), and pre-lamin A (6214) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. GFP antibodies were obtained from Abcam. Human SUN1 (2379) antibodies were generated by immunization of rabbits with an MBP-hSUN1 C-terminal domain fusion protein (residues 352–812 of the 812 residue isoform). Human SUN2 (2853) antibodies and mouse SUN2 (2294) antibodies were generated by immunization of rabbits with a peptide corresponding to residues 1–18 of human or mouse SUN2, respectively. Immunizations were performed by Cambridge Research Biochemicals. The 2379 and 2853 antibodies were affinity-purified using Affi-Gel 15 columns (Bio-Rad). Pulldown assays were performed as described previously (4Haque F. Lloyd D.J. Smallwood D.T. Dent C.L. Shanahan C.M. Fry A.M. Trembath R.C. Shackleton S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3738-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). For determining the effects of lamin A and emerin mutations on interactions with SUN1/2, pulldown assays were quantified by densitometry using Image J (National Institutes of Health), and values were normalized against the 10% input lane. Results for mutants were expressed as a percentage of the wild-type value, and the average ± S.E. for 3–4 experiments was calculated. Statistical significance was determined using a Student’s t test. HGPS fibroblasts carrying the G608G mutation (AG11513B) were obtained from the Coriell Repository, whereas those with the T623S mutation were provided by Louise Wilson (Great Ormond Street Hospital, London). Skin fibroblasts from EDMD patients were supplied by Manfred Wehnert (Institute for Human Genetics, Greifswald, Germany). NIH 3T3, U2OS, control human foreskin fibroblasts, and the patient skin fibroblast cells were all grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen). Human fibroblasts were used between passages 9 and 12. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells transfected with plasmids were incubated for 24–48 h post-transfection. siRNA-transfected cells were incubated for 48 h before analysis. Mouse SUN1 SMARTpool siRNAs and human and mouse lamin A/C control siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon. A mouse SUN2 stealth siRNA (5′-CATACCAAGTTGTGGAGCTTCGGAT-3′) was purchased from Invitrogen. For immunoprecipitation studies, 10-cm plates of NIH 3T3 or U2OS cells transfected with the appropriate Myc-tagged SUN1 or SUN2 and/or GFP-tagged nesprin constructs were lysed and immunoprecipitated as described previously (4Haque F.

For immunoblotting, total cell lysates were prepared from RNAi-treated NIH 3T3 cells and from skin fibroblasts. All samples were boiled in an equal volume of Laemmli buffer and subjected to gel electrophoresis followed by semidry transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were probed using the appropriate primary antibodies and dilutions: Myc (1:500), GFP (1:6000), mSUN1 (1:500), mSUN2 (1:1000), hSUN1 (1:500), hSUN2 (1:200), lamin A/C (1:1000), pre-lamin A (1:100), and actin (1:10,000). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and visualization was performed using ECL reagents (Geneflow). Cells grown on coverslips were either fixed directly in methanol at −20 °C or, for Triton X-100 pre-extraction experiments, were first incubated on ice for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100. Alternatively, for digitonin permeabilization studies, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, then permeabilized with either 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice or with 40 μg/ml digitonin for 4 min on ice. Samples were then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy as previously described (4Haque F. Lloyd D.J. Smallwood D.T. Dent C.L. Shanahan C.M. Fry A.M. Trembath R.C. Shackleton S. Mol. Cell.

Primary antibodies were detected using donkey AlexaFluor 488 and 594 secondary antibodies (1:500; Invitrogen) raised against the appropriate species, and DNA was stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Quantification of pre-lamin A and either SUN1 or SUN2 intensity was performed using an Olympus ScanR microscope with a 20× objective. Approximately 1000 nuclei were selected at random by their 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) signal, and the intensity of pre-lamin A (594 nm) and SUN1 or SUN2 (488 nm) was measured within the DAPI-stained region. In this study we set out to identify further SUN1-binding proteins and examine their roles in anchoring SUN proteins at the NE. Because emerin interacts with both lamin A and short nesprin isoforms, we examined the possibility that it also interacts with SUN1 and SUN2 by immunoprecipitation. Because of the high insolubility of endogenous SUN proteins (4Haque F. Lloyd D.J. Smallwood D.T. Dent C.L. Shanahan C.M. Fry A.M. Trembath R.C. Shackleton S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 3738-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding Myc-tagged mouse SUN1 (mSUN1) or human SUN2 (hSUN2). Emerin antibodies successfully co-precipitated SUN1 and SUN2, whereas control antibodies did not, indicating that emerin is capable of interaction with both SUN1 and SUN2 (Fig. 1A). These interactions were confirmed by in vitro pulldown assays using a GST-emerin construct encoding only the nucleoplasmic N-terminal domain (NTD) of the protein (residues 1–221 of the 254 amino acid protein; Fig. 1B), suggesting that the interaction involves the nucleoplasmic domains of both proteins. A proportion of emerin has been reported to localize to the ONM, with its NTD projecting into the cytosol, where it may play a role in centrosome attachment to the NE (45Salpingidou G. Smertenko A. Hausmanowa-Petrucewicz I. Hussey P.J. Hutchison C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We, therefore, wished to rule out the possibility that the SUN-emerin interaction occurs at the ONM. Several studies have previously reported the absence of the SUN1 N terminus from the outer face of the NE (3Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 41-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 4Haque F. Lloyd D.J. Smallwood D.T. Dent C.L. Shanahan C.M. Fry A.M. Trembath R.C. Shackleton S. Mol. Cell.

Cell Res. 2004; 295: 330-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To determine whether SUN2 is present at the ONM, we first raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the N terminus of mouse SUN2 (see the supplemental figure). These were then used to detect the SUN2 NTD in NIH 3T3 cells treated with digitonin on ice for 4 min. Co-staining with α-tubulin antibodies confirmed that the plasma membrane had been permeabilized under these conditions (Fig. 1C). In contrast, although significant background cytoplasmic staining was obtained with the mSUN2 antibody after paraformaldehyde fixation, it could clearly be seen that there was no specific staining of the nuclear envelope. This result indicates that, like SUN1, SUN2 is absent from the ONM and strongly suggests that the SUN-emerin interactions occur at the INM. The SUN1 binding site for emerin was then mapped by in vitro pulldown assays using MBP- or GST-fused SUN1 deletion constructs to pull down in vitro translated full-length emerin (Fig. 1, D and E). Initially, we determined that the nucleoplasmic NTD of SUN1 (residues 1–355) is indeed responsible for interaction with emerin, whereas the lumenal C-terminal domain (residues 450–913) does not bind emerin. Further mapping revealed a major emerin binding site at the distal end of the SUN1 NTD (residues 223–302), although a weak interaction was also observed with the proximal end (residues 1–208). Unexpectedly, alignment of the mouse SUN1 and SUN2 sequences revealed that the region homologous to the emerin binding site of SUN1 is absent from the shorter SUN2 NTD (Fig. 1F, boxed region). In keeping with this, we detected only a very low level of interaction between emerin and a GST fusion of the mouse SUN2 NTD (residues 1–174 of the 729 amino acid protein; Fig. 1G). Therefore, although SUN1 and SUN2 are both capable of interaction with emerin, they may have different modes of interaction. Similar studies were performed to determine whether SUN1 and SUN2 interact with the short, nucleoplasmic-facing nesprin-2 isoforms. In addition to their documented interaction with the lumenal KASH domain of nesprin-2 (3Crisp M. Liu Q. Roux K. Rattner J.B. Shanahan C. Burke B. Stahl P.D. Hodzic D. J.

This hypothesis places emphasis on the FT secretory epithelial cell as a cell-of-origin. Herein, we report the development of a novel ex vivo primary human FT epithelium culture system that faithfully recapitulates the in vivo epithelium, as shown by morphological, ultrastructural and immunophenotypic analyses. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics reveal that these cultures secrete proteins previously identified as biomarkers for ovarian cancer. We also use this culture system to study the response of the FT epithelium to genotoxic stress and find that the secretory cells exhibit a distinct response to DNA damage when compared with neighboring ciliated cells. The secretory cells show a limited ability to resolve the damage over time, potentially leaving them more susceptible to accumulation of additional mutagenic injury. This divergent response is confirmed with in situ studies using tissue samples, further supporting the use of this ex vivo culture system to investigate FT epithelial pathobiology. We anticipate that this novel culture system will facilitate the study of SOC pathogenesis, and propose that similar culture systems could be developed for other organ site-specific epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1991505160,"Quorum sensing refers to a signaling mechanism allowing the behavior of bacterial populations to be coordinated based on cell density. Physical isolation of individual bacterial cells revealed that a single bacterium can respond to quorum sensing signals resulting in genetic reprogramming and enhanced. It is postulated that in addition to cell density, other factors such as the dimensions and diffusional characteristics of the environment could influence quorum sensing (QS) and induction of genetic reprogramming. Modeling studies predict that QS may operate at the level of a single cell, but, owing to experimental challenges, the potential benefits of QS by individual cells remain virtually unexplored. Here we report a physical system that mimics isolation of a bacterium, such as within an endosome or phagosome during infection, and maintains cell viability under conditions of complete chemical and physical isolation. For Staphylococcus aureus, we show that quorum sensing and genetic reprogramming can occur in a single isolated organism. Quorum sensing allows S. aureus to sense confinement and to activate virulence and metabolic pathways needed for survival. To demonstrate the benefit of confinement-induced quorum sensing to individuals, we showed that quorum-sensing bacteria have significantly greater viability over non-QS bacteria."

They can accelerate particles to relativistic energies and emit radio flares, but the mechanism of jet energization is not known. A survey of the Cygnus region between mid-2007 and mid-2009 has detected four major γ-ray flaring episodes with energies over 100 MeV, each lasting 1 or 2 days, emanating from the microquasar Cygnus X-3. There is a clear pattern of temporal correlation between the γ-ray flares and transitional spectral states of radio and X-ray emission. Particle acceleration occurred a few days before radio jet ejections for two of the flares, suggesting that jet formation involves the production of highly energetic particles. Super-massive black holes in active galaxies can accelerate particles to relativistic energies, producing jets with associated γ-ray emission. Galactic 'microquasars' also produce relativistic jets; however, apart from an isolated event detected in Cygnus X-1, there has hitherto been no systematic evidence for the acceleration of particles to gigaelectronvolt or higher energies in a microquasar. Here, a report of four γ-ray flares with energies above 100 MeV from the microquasar Cygnus X-3 illuminates this important problem. Super-massive black holes in active galaxies can accelerate particles to relativistic energies1, producing jets with associated γ-ray emission. Galactic ‘microquasars’, which are binary systems consisting of a neutron star or stellar-mass black hole accreting gas from a companion star, also produce relativistic jets, generally together with radio flares2. Apart from an isolated event detected3 in Cygnus X-1, there has hitherto been no systematic evidence for the acceleration of particles to gigaelectronvolt or higher energies in a microquasar, with the consequence that we are as yet unsure about the mechanism of jet energization. Here we report four γ-ray flares with energies above 100 MeV from the microquasar Cygnus X-3 (an exceptional X-ray binary4,5,6 that sporadically produces radio jets7,8,9). There is a clear pattern of temporal correlations between the γ-ray flares and transitional spectral states of the radio-frequency and X-ray emission. Particle acceleration occurred a few days before radio-jet ejections for two of the four flares, meaning that the process of jet formation implies the production of very energetic particles. In Cygnus X-3, particle energies during the flares can be thousands of times higher than during quiescent states."

https://openalex.org/W1994304210,"The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling cascade activates genes that allow cells to adopt particular identities throughout development. In adult self-renewing tissues like intestine and blood, activation of the Wnt pathway maintains a progenitor phenotype, whereas forced inhibition of this pathway promotes differentiation. In the lung alveolus, type 2 epithelial cells (AT2) have been described as progenitors for the type 1 cell (AT1), but whether AT2 progenitors use the same signaling mechanisms to control differentiation as rapidly renewing tissues is not known. We show that adult AT2 cells do not exhibit constitutive beta-catenin signaling in vivo, using the AXIN2(+/LacZ) reporter mouse, or after fresh isolation of an enriched population of AT2 cells. Rather, this pathway is activated in lungs subjected to bleomycin-induced injury, as well as upon placement of AT2 cells in culture. Forced inhibition of beta-catenin/T-cell factor signaling in AT2 cultures leads to increased cell death. Cells that survive show reduced migration after wounding and reduced expression of AT1 cell markers (T1alpha and RAGE). These results suggest that AT2 cells may function as facultative progenitors, where activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during lung injury promotes alveolar epithelial survival, migration, and differentiation toward an AT1-like phenotype."

Knowledge of the adhesion receptors that hES cells employ to engage extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins is of basic biological interest and can enhance the design of cell culture and implantation systems to enable these biomedical applications. Although hES cells express a variety of cell surface receptors, little is known about which integrins are involved during subculture and passage. Matrigel is broadly used as a cell adhesive matrix for hES cell culture. Here, we sought to identify which integrins hES cells exploit for adhesion to Matrigel-coated surfaces in defined medium conditions. Using RT-PCR, flow cytometry, and fluorescence immunochemistry, we found that numerous integrins were expressed by H1 hES cells; however, antibody blocking assays indicated that only alpha(v)beta(3), alpha(6), beta(1), and alpha(2)beta(1) played a significant role in the initial adhesion of the hES cells to Matrigel in defined medium conditions. We subsequently identified a cohort of synthetic peptides that, when adsorbed to the culture surface, promoted H1 hES cell attachment and proliferation, as well as maintained a pluripotent phenotype. Peptides designed to engage with alpha(v)beta(3), alpha(6), beta(1), and alpha(2)beta(1) integrins and syndecan-1 were tested both individually and in various combinations. A combination of two integrin-engaging peptides (AG-10, C-16) and one syndecan-engaging peptide (AG-73) was sufficient to promote hES cell adhesion, maintenance, and proliferation. We propose that a specific integrin ""fingerprint"" is necessary for maintenance of hES cell self-renewal, and synthetic culture systems must capture this engagement profile for hES cells to remain undifferentiated.-Meng, Y., Eshghi, S., Li, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2146797307,"Post-translational modification of nucleocytoplasmic proteins by O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) has for the last 25 years emerged as an essential glucose-sensing mechanism. The liver X receptors (LXRs) function as nutritional sensors for cholesterol-regulating lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation. LXRs are shown to be post-translationally modified by phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation, affecting their target gene specificity, stability, and transactivating and transrepressional activity, respectively. In the present study, we show for the first time that LXRalpha and LXRbeta are targets for glucose-hexosamine-derived O-GlcNAc modification in human Huh7 cells. Furthermore, we observed increased hepatic LXRalpha O-GlcNAcylation in vivo in refed mice and in streptozotocin-induced refed diabetic mice. Importantly, induction of LXRalpha O-GlcNAcylation in both mouse models was concomitant with increased expression of the lipogenic gene SREBP-1c (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c). Furthermore, glucose increased LXR/retinoic acid receptor-dependent activation of luciferase reporter activity driven by the mouse SREBP-1c promoter via the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway in Huh7 cells. Altogether, our results suggest that O-GlcNAcylation of LXR is a novel mechanism by which LXR acts as a glucose sensor affecting LXR-dependent gene expression, substantiating the crucial role of LXR as a nutritional sensor in lipid and glucose metabolism."

One such disease, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT, or bone marrow transplant), is common even after transplants between HLA-identical siblings, indicating that cryptic histocompatibility loci exist outside the HLA locus. The immune system of an individual whose genome is homozygous for a gene deletion could recognize epitopes encoded by that gene as alloantigens. Analyzing common gene deletions in three HSCT cohorts (1,345 HLA-identical sibling donor-recipient pairs), we found that risk of acute GVHD was greater (odds ratio (OR) = 2.5; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-4.6) when donor and recipient were mismatched for homozygous deletion of UGT2B17, a gene expressed in GVHD-affected tissues and giving rise to multiple histocompatibility antigens.

We therefore prepared a set of model nucleosome substrates in which single thymidine residues were replaced with uracil at specific locations and a second set of nucleosomes in which uracils were randomly substituted for all thymidines. We found that UDG efficiently removes uracil from internal locations in the nucleosome where the DNA backbone is oriented away from the surface of the histone octamer, without significant disruption of histone-DNA interactions. However, uracils at sites oriented toward the histone octamer surface were excised at much slower rates, consistent with a mechanism requiring spontaneous DNA unwrapping from the nucleosome. In contrast to the nucleosome core, UDG activity on DNA outside the core DNA region was similar to that of naked DNA.

A prototypical family of DNA glycosylases are the Family 1 uracil DNA glycosylases (UDGs), which specifically remove uracil in DNA that results from either misincorporation during replication, leading to A-U matches, or deamination of cytosine, leading to G-U mismatches (7Pearl L.H.

The basic repeating subunit of chromatin is the nucleosome, consisting of a nucleosome core in which ∼147 bp of DNA is wrapped ∼1.7 times around a protein spool consisting of two copies each the four core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 and 10–80 bp of linker DNA that links cores together (24Luger K.

Each nucleosome repeat is bound by one linker histone (e.g. H10, H1, and H5) and non-histone chromosomal proteins that promote folding and condensation of nucleosomes into the 30-nm chromatin fiber and other higher order structures present in the cell nucleus (25van Holde K.E.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 602-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Likewise, the activity of the short-patch BER-associated polymerase β appears to be totally inhibited by the presence of a nucleosome (33Beard B.C. Stevenson J.J. Wilson S.H. Smerdon M.J. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Beard B.C. Wilson S.H. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7465-7470Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, some BER-associated enzymes have been found to exhibit significant activity on nucleosome substrates in vitro. For example, FEN1 and DNA ligase 1 are able to carry out their respective activities sequentially on the same nucleosome substrate without significant disruption of histone-DNA interactions (35Huggins C.F.

Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Hayes J.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5492-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This suggests that the final steps of some BER events may not require chromatin remodeling activities.The ability of several DNA glycosylases, either alone or in conjunction with other BER factors, to process targets buried in nucleosomes has been investigated, with somewhat conflicting results. Recently, Menoni et al. (37Menoni H. Gasparutto D. Hamiche A. Cadet J. Dimitrov S. Bouvet P. Angelov D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 5949-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) showed that OGG1, which removes 8-oxoG from DNA is inhibited ∼100-fold at a site 10 bp from the nucleosome dyad, whereas AP endonuclease 1 exhibited no activity on nucleosomes. However, the glycosylase NTH1 was shown to efficiently process thymine glycol lesions oriented away from the histone octamer surface at a site about 50 bp from the nucleosome dyad but sites oriented toward the histone octamer or closer to the dyad were removed at a reduced efficiency compared with naked DNA (38Prasad A. Wallace S.S. Pederson D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 8442-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The activity of the glycosylase MBD4 was found to be diminished but not abolished for T/G mismatches within a reconstituted nucleosome in a manner apparently not dependent on position with respect to the dyad, whereas histone hyperacetylation increased the efficiency with which the bases were excised (39Ishibashi T. So K. Cupples C.G. Ausió J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 4734-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Likewise, two groups (33Beard B.C. Stevenson J.J. Wilson S.H. Smerdon M.J. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Beard B.C. Wilson S.H. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5943-5952Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have investigated the activity of human UDGs, SMUG1 and UNG2, in conjunction with AP endonuclease 1, and DNA polymerase β on nucleosomal substrates. Both groups found that the DNA glycosylases and AP endonuclease exhibited marginally reduced activities on nucleosomal substrates but determined somewhat different extents of inhibition compared with free DNA substrates and came to different conclusions regarding the effect of rotational orientation (33Beard B.C. Stevenson J.J. Wilson S.H. Smerdon M.J. DNA Repair. 2005; 4: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Beard B.C. Wilson S.H. Smerdon M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A possible reason for these differences may be that the two groups assayed the enzymes’ activities using different DNA sequences. Importantly all studies of glycosylase activity have been carried out at a single or limited number of sites within the nucleosome.To address differences in these results and obtain a more comprehensive view of glycosylase activity in chromatin, we carried out a systematic examination of UDG activity throughout a nucleosome substrate. We find that UDG excision within the nucleosome is significantly decreased compared with free DNA, consistent with previously published data. However, UDG activity on nucleosomal DNA is dependent on both rotational and translational positioning of the uracil, resulting in significant variations in the proficiency of this first step of repair. UDG activity on DNA outside the core region is commensurate with that of naked DNA, whereas H1 association reduces UDG at specific sites with the nucleosome core and in the linker DNA.RESULTSTo examine the activity of UDG at specific sites within a nucleosome, single thymine residues were substituted for uracil to generate U:A base pairs at specific locations within a 154-bp DNA fragment containing the Xenopus 5 S nucleosome-positioning element (Fig. 1, A and B). Sites were chosen for substitution based on previous characterization of the translational and rotational orientation of 5 S DNA assembled into a nucleosome and correspond to locations where the DNA backbone is oriented approximately toward or away from the surface of the histone octamer (42Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21352-21358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 45Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). All of the U for T substitutions were in the “top” strand of the DNA fragment, which was specifically radiolabeled at the 5′ end before annealing with the complementary strand (Fig. 1A). We also prepared a 42-bp DNA fragment containing a single U substitution to include in the reactions as an internal naked DNA reference (Fig. 1A). UDG cleavage of the glycosidic bond of U residues was followed by base-catalyzed elimination of the AP site and breakage of the DNA backbone so that cleavage could be detected by DNA sequencing gel electrophoresis. Control experiments demonstrated that both the presence of a U in the DNA and the UDG enzyme were necessary to observe cleavage products and that UDG cleavage of Us within the 154- and 42-bp free DNA substrates occurred at equivalent rates (not shown, see below).The 154-bp U-containing DNA templates were then reconstituted into nucleosomes via standard salt dialysis with purified histones. Analysis of nucleosomes reconstituted with native and U-containing DNA fragments on 0.7% native agarose gels indicated that the presence of uracil did not detectably alter the efficiency of reconstitution (Fig. 1C). Remaining naked DNA and subnucleosomal products from the reconstitution were purified away from the nucleosome products by sedimentation through sucrose gradients (Fig. 1D and not shown). Hydroxyl radical footprinting of purified U-containing nucleosomes and naked DNA showed that the latter is cleaved uniformly throughout, the nucleosome exhibits the expected wave-like pattern for a properly rotationally and translationally positioned 5 S nucleosome (supplemental Fig. S1 and results not shown) (42Thiriet C. Hayes J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21352-21358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, the single U substitutions do not detectably alter nucleosome positioning or rotational orientation of 5 S DNA on the histone surface as expected, given the rather modest change in structure (loss of one C5 methyl group) upon single U substitution within the DNA fragment.We first investigated the activity of UDG on a U located at position +22 within the 154(+22U) nucleosome (numbers indicate distance from the nucleosome dyad in base pairs), where the DNA backbone is oriented away from the core histone surface. Equivalent moles and specific activities of the nucleosome and free DNA substrates were incubated together with 0.05 units of UDG at 37 °C. At each time point an aliquot was removed, the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS and strand cleavage induced by base treatment. The products of the reactions were analyzed on sequencing gels and the fraction of substrate cleaved by UDG was determined and plotted versus reaction time. The results of these experiments revealed that UDG clearly excised a significant fraction of the uracil from the +22 site in the 154-bp nucleosome (Fig. 2A). A plot of product produced versus time is fit well by a single exponential for both the nucleosome and naked DNA substrates and indicates that 80–90% of each substrate was digested during the course of these reactions (Fig. 2B). Comparison of apparent first-order rate constants obtained from the fits showed that the rate of UDGs cleavage at the “outward facing” +22 site in the nucleosome substrate was about 6-fold slower than the rate of cleavage of the naked DNA substrate (see Table 1).TABLE 1Single U kinetic assay resultsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab We next investigated a neighboring “inward facing” site, in which a uracil was located at position +28 within the 154(+28U) nucleosome substrate (Figs. 1B and 3A). Interestingly, at the same enzyme concentration used in the experiment shown in Fig. 2A, the digestion kinetics for the nucleosome appeared biphasic, with about 10% of the substrate digested at rates approximately equivalent to that of naked DNA, whereas additional substrate was cleaved much more slowly, such that the bulk of the substrate remained undigested at the longest time points investigated (Fig. 3B). We thus increased the amount of enzyme several hundredfold and repeated the assays (Fig. 3, C and D). At the increased enzyme concentration the rapid phase was over before the first time point and a second, slower phase was now apparent that included the majority of the nucleosome substrate. We assume the more slowly digesting material, which we estimate encompasses >80% of the nucleosome substrate, represents bona fide nucleosomes positioned at the expected location, whereas the ∼10% of rapidly digesting material may represent a small amount of dissociated or alternatively positioned templates, not uncommon for nucleosome preparations as demonstrated by restriction enzyme digests of similar samples (46Aoyagi S. Hayes J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7484-7490Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”). Thus a small amount (10%) of nucleosome sample digests as free DNA, whereas the bulk of the nucleosome substrate bearing inward facing U digests with kinetics significantly slower than the naked DNA. Quantification showed UDG digests the inward facing U at position +28 in the nucleosome almost 3,000 times more slowly than the uracil in the 42-bp naked DNA fragment (Table 1).FIGURE 3Uracil at an inward facing site within the nucleosome is excised very slowly by UDG. Nucleosomes reconstituted with the 154(+28U) DNA template were combined with the 42-bp reference DNA fragment before incubation with UDG and analysis of cleavage as described in the text.

Data were fitted to a single exponential as described in the legend to Fig. 2B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We repeated the experiment with nucleosomes containing single Us substituted for Ts at six other sites throughout the 5 S sequence (Fig. 1B). In general, we found that the outward facing sites were cleaved only marginally more slowly than equivalent sites in free DNA (3–6-fold slower), whereas inward facing sites exhibited several thousand-fold slower cleavage rates compared with both free DNA and the outward facing sites (see Table 1). An exception was the one outward facing site located at the nucleosome dyad, which is cleaved by UDG with much slower kinetics compared with other outward facing sites.Although the single U substitution templates allowed accurate determination of rates of UDG cleavage within nucleosome and naked DNA substrates, we also wished to assess the activity of UDG more globally throughout the nucleosome. Thus we used a PCR technique to generate a 227-bp DNA template based on the Xenopus 5 S nucleosome positioning sequence that contained random U for T substitutions throughout the DNA sequence. This template allowed us to investigate the rate of UDG activity on core versus extra-core (linker) DNA, and to study the effects of linker histone H1 on the activity of UDG. We determined that replacement of 5% of the dTTP in the PCR with dUTP resulted in about one uracil incorporated per strand on average within the nucleosome templates (results not shown). Labeling of one of the two primers allowed analysis of UDG cleavage throughout each DNA strand independently (see “Experimental Procedures”). Nucleoprotein gels showed that the DNAs were efficiently reconstituted into nucleosomes (results not shown).The 227-bp global U substitution nucleosomes were incubated with UDG for increasing amounts of time, the reactions were terminated, and nucleosomes and free DNA were isolated on preparative nucleoprotein gels. In these experiments we employed a concentration of enzyme sufficient to just cut naked DNA to completion over the time course to provide better contrast between exposed and protected regions, thus most internal nucleosome sites are not appreciably cleaved. DNA was isolated from the naked DNA and nucleosome bands and UDG activity analyzed as for the single-U assays. As expected from the single-site assays, we found activity of UDG was significantly decreased throughout the region encompassed by the nucleosome core (−73 to +73, top strand) on both strands (Fig. 4, A and B, ovals). However, DNA outside of the nucleosome core region was cut to an extent equal to that of the naked DNA (dashed line). Densitometric analysis of the cleavage patterns confirms the patterns of protection (Fig. 4, C and D). Although statistically reliable rate data cannot be derived for the core region from these gels due to the low extent of cleavage, it is clear that a few sites within the nucleosome core are appreciably cleaved, specifically positions −26, −16, +51, and +60 on the bottom strand, whereas nearby sites at +44 and +56/57 are protected from cleavage (Fig. 4B). It is interesting to note that all cleaved sites occur where the DNA backbone is predicted to be oriented away from the core histone octamer in the nucleosome, complementing our single-site analysis (see “Discussion”).FIGURE 4Global analysis of UDG activity within nucleosome core and linker DNA regions.

Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), despite the propensity of these proteins to bind strongly and cooperatively to naked DNA (48Clark D.J. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To investigate whether binding of a linker histone to the nucleosome affects UDG activity, we first titrated increasing amounts of purified H1 with the 227-bp global U nucleosomes to determine the optimal ratio that provided a discernable nucleosome + H1 gel shift band but no binding to naked DNA to ensure a single H1 bound to each nucleosome in the shifted band (Fig. 5A) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The effect of H1 on the activity of UDG was assayed by incubating the complexes with enzyme, and separating free DNA, nucleosome, and nucleosome + H1 complexes by preparative nucleoprotein gels (not shown). DNA was extracted from the gel slices and the UDG cleavage pattern resolved on sequencing gels, as before. Densitometric comparisons of the nucleosome and nucleosome + H1 cleavage patterns show that in the presence of H1, UDG cleavage within the nucleosome core region was reduced at positions +71, +64, +47, +14, and −12 on the top DNA strand and −55, −14, +7 on the bottom strand (Fig. 5, B and C, red numbers), whereas other residues were cleaved to identical extents in the presence and absence of H1 (black numbers). Interestingly, when mapped onto a model of the nucleosome (Fig. 5, D–F), we find that these sites are primarily located in the “front” of the nucleosome, near where the nucleosome dyad passes through the DNA. H1 binding also reduced cleavage at selected sites within the “linker” DNA outside of the core region. For example, UDG cleavages at sites +81 and +75 on the top strand and +76, +90, and +102 on the bottom strand are reduced in the presence of H1, whereas cleavages at nearby sites (e.g. +79, +83, +92, +103, and +105 on the bottom strand) are unchanged (Fig. 5, B and C).FIGURE 5H1 association reduces UDG activity in both core and linker DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2159321476,"Nardilysin (NRDc) enhances the shedding of ectodomains from neuronal membrane proteins. The null mutant described here reveals that nardilysin is necessary for myelination in both central and peripheral nervous system. Axonal maturation and myelination are essential processes for establishing an efficient neuronal signaling network. We found that nardilysin (N-arginine dibasic convertase, also known as Nrd1 and NRDc), a metalloendopeptidase enhancer of protein ectodomain shedding, is a critical regulator of these processes. Nrd1−/− mice had smaller brains and a thin cerebral cortex, in which there were less myelinated fibers with thinner myelin sheaths and smaller axon diameters. We also found hypomyelination in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of Nrd1−/− mice. Neuron-specific overexpression of NRDc induced hypermyelination, indicating that the level of neuronal NRDc regulates myelin thickness. Consistent with these findings, Nrd1−/− mice had impaired motor activities and cognitive deficits. Furthermore, NRDc enhanced ectodomain shedding of neuregulin1 (NRG1), which is a master regulator of myelination in the PNS. On the basis of these data, we propose that NRDc regulates axonal maturation and myelination in the CNS and PNS, in part, through the modulation of NRG1 shedding."
https://openalex.org/W1983148314,"Overexpression of the forkhead family transcription factor Foxc2 has been shown to activate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and correlate with tumor metastasis. In this study, we show that both mRNA and protein levels of Foxc2 increase 1 day after kidney ischemia/reperfusion in sublethally injured tubular cells and that the protein is located in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus of these cells. in vitro studies of cultured tubular cells confirm the cytoplasmic location of Foxc2 and show that increased cytoplasmic expression of Foxc2 correlates with epithelial differentiation rather than dedifferentiation. Silencing of Foxc2 by RNAi in these cells led to EMT and increased cell migration. In contrast, Foxc2 is found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of cultured fibroblasts, with RNAi leading to increased expression of epithelial markers and impaired cell migration. Consistent with a subcellular localization dependence of Foxc2 function, overexpression of Foxc2 in renal epithelial cells resulted in de novo nuclear expression of the protein and promotion of a mesenchymal/fibroblast phenotype. These results suggest that Foxc2 may have regulatory functions independent of its nuclear transcriptional activity and that upregulation of endogenous Foxc2 in the cytoplasm of injured tubular cells activates epithelial cell redifferentiation rather than dedifferentiation during organ repair."

https://openalex.org/W2000474379,"Tumor cells are capable of surviving loss of nutrients and anchorage in hostile microenvironments. Under these conditions, adapting to specific signaling pathways may shift the balance between growth and cellular dormancy. Here, we report a mechanism by which epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) differentially modulates the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in cellular stress conditions. When carcinoma cells were cultured as multicellular aggregates (MCA), cyclin D1 was induced through a serum-dependent EGFR activating pathway, triggering cell proliferation. The expression of cyclin D1 required both EGFR-mediated ERK and AKT activation. In serum-starved MCAs, EGFR activation was associated with active ERK1/2, but not AKT, and failed to induce cyclin D1. Analysis revealed that, under serum-starved conditions, EGFR-Y1086 residue was poorly autophosphorylated and this correlated with failure to phosphorylate Gab1. Accordingly, the EGFR activation failed to induce EGFR/PI3K complex formation or AKT activation, preventing cyclin D1 induction. Furthermore, we show that in serum-starved MCA, expression of constitutively active AKT re-established cyclin D1 expression and induced proliferation in an EGFR-dependent manner. Thus, modulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway by context-dependent EGFR signaling may regulate tumor cell growth and dormancy."
https://openalex.org/W1986892567,"The effect of p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and senescence on Emu-myc-induced B-cell lymphoma development remains controversial. To address this question, we crossed Emu-myc mice with the p53(515C) mutant mouse, encoding the mutant p53R172P protein that retains the ability to activate the cell-cycle inhibitor and senescence activator p21. Importantly, this mutant lacks the ability to activate p53-dependent apoptotic genes. Hence, Emu-myc mice that harbor two p53(515C) alleles are completely defective for p53-dependent apoptosis. Both Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) mice survive significantly longer than Emu-myc::p53(+/-) mice, indicating the importance of the p53-dependent non-apoptotic pathways in B-cell lymphomagenesis. In addition, the p53(515C) allele is deleted in several Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) lymphomas, further emphasizing the functionality of p53R172P in tumor inhibition. Lymphomas from both Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) mice retain the ability to upregulate p21, resulting in cellular senescence. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA beta-gal) activity was observed in lymphomas from Emu-myc::p53(+/+), Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C /+) mice but not in lymphomas isolated from Emu-myc::p53(+/-) mice. Thus, in the absence of p53-dependent apoptosis, the ability of p53R172P to induce senescence leads to a significant delay in B-cell lymphoma development."
https://openalex.org/W2093797483,"p53 is a transcription factor that maintains genome integrity, and its function is lost in 50% of human cancers. The majority of p53 mutations are clustered within the core domain. Here, we investigate the effects of low pH on the structure of the wild-type (wt) p53 core domain (p53C) and the R248Q mutant. At low pH, the tryptophan residue is partially exposed to the solvent, suggesting a fluctuating tertiary structure. On the other hand, the secondary structure increases, as determined by circular dichroism. Binding of the probe bis-ANS (bis-8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulfonate) indicates that there is an increase in the exposure of hydrophobic pockets for both wt and mutant p53C at low pH. This behavior is accompanied by a lack of cooperativity under urea denaturation and decreased stability under pressure when p53C is in acidic pH. Together, these results indicate that p53C acquires a partially unfolded conformation (molten-globule state) at low pH (5.0). The hydrodynamic properties of this conformation are intermediate between the native and denatured conformation. (1)H-(15)N HSQC NMR spectroscopy confirms that the protein has a typical molten-globule structure at acidic pH when compared with pH 7.2. Human breast cells in culture (MCF-7) transfected with p53-GFP revealed localization of p53 in acidic vesicles, suggesting that the low pH conformation is present in the cell. Low pH stress also tends to favor high levels of p53 in the cells. Taken together, all of these data suggest that p53 may play physiological or pathological roles in acidic microenvironments."

Tissue-specific deletion of platelet β3-integrins in β3KOP mice did not affect bone mass but resulted in a severe bleeding phenotype. No growth difference of tumor xenografts or in neoangiogenesis were found in β3KOP mice, in contrast to the defects observed in germline β3−/− mice. Conditional deletion of myeloid β3-integrins in β3KOM mice resulted in osteopetrosis but had no effect on hemostasis or mortality. Tumor growth in β3KOM mice was increased and accompanied by decreased macrophage infiltration, without increase in blood vessel number. Platelet β3-integrin deficiency was sufficient to disrupt hemostasis but had no effect on bone mass or tumor growth. Myeloid-specific β3-integrin deletion was sufficient to perturb bone mass and enhance tumor growth due to reduced macrophage infiltration in the tumors. These results suggest that β3-integrins have cell-specific roles in complex biological processes.—Morgan, E. A., Schneider, J. G., Baroni, T. E., Uluçkan, Ö., Heller, E., Hurchla, M.

Selective inhibition of NFATc1 by its small interfering RNA also blocked HASMC proliferation and migration.

https://openalex.org/W2006257070,"The inhibitor of growth family member 3 (ING3) has been shown to modulate transcription, cell cycle control and apoptosis. We previously reported that nuclear ING3 expression was remarkably reduced in melanomas, which correlated with a poorer patient survival, suggesting that decreased ING3 expression may be associated with melanoma progression. However, the mechanism of diminished ING3 expression in melanoma is not clear. Here we show that ING3 level was decreased in metastatic melanoma cells because of a rapid degradation. Furthermore, we showed that ING3 undergoes degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. ING3 physically interacts with subunits of E3 ligase Skp1-Cullin-F-box protein complex (SCF complex). Knockdown of F-box protein S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (Skp2) reduces the ubiquitination of ING3 and significantly stabilizes ING3 in melanoma cells. In addition, lysine 96 residue is essential for ING3 ubiquitination as its mutation to arginine dramatically abrogated ING3 degradation. Disruption of ING3 degradation stimulated ING3-induced G1 cell-cycle arrest and enhanced ultraviolet-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data show that ING3 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway through the SCF(Skp2) complex and interruption of ING3 degradation enhances the tumor-suppressive function of ING3, which provides a potential cancer therapeutic approach by interfering ING3 degradation."

https://openalex.org/W2071382016,"Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and components of the extracellular matrix, thereby profoundly affecting the microenvironment of cells including cancerous ones. We studied MMP-10 induction by TGF-beta in mammary epithelial cells and found that the induction was dependent on the myocyte enhancer factor (MEF)-2 transcription factor. TGF-beta upregulated the gene promoter through the MEF2 site, and knockdown of the MEF2A transcription factor negatively affected MMP-10 induction, whereas its overexpression had a positive effect on the induction. In response to TGF-beta, acetylation and concomitant binding of MEF2A to the promoter region increased, thus suggesting a critical role of MEF2A in transactivation of MMP-10 by TGF-beta. Consistent with the fact that class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs) interact with MEF2 and suppress transcription, knockdown of HDACs increased and their overexpression inhibited MMP-10 expression. Intriguingly, TGF-beta promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of HDACs. Consistent with this, acetylation of core histones was increased around the MEF2 site of the MMP-10 promoter by TGF-beta and alleviated by overexpression of HDACs. Collectively, it is possible that TGF-beta transcriptionally upregulated MMP-10 through activation of MEF2A, concomitant with acetylation of core histones increasing around the promoter, as a consequence of degradation of the class IIa HDACs."
https://openalex.org/W2069874077,"The identity of the source of the biological reductant needed to convert cobalamin to its biologically active form adenosylcobalamin has remained elusive. Here we show that free or protein-bound dihydroflavins can serve as the reductant of Co(2+)Cbl bound in the active site of PduO-type ATP-dependent corrinoid adenosyltransferase enzymes. Free dihydroflavins (dihydroriboflavin, FMNH(2), and FADH(2)) effectively drove the adenosylation of Co(2+)Cbl by the human and bacterial PduO-type enzymes at very low concentrations (1 microm). These data show that adenosyltransferase enzymes lower the thermodynamic barrier of the Co(2+) --> Co(+) reduction needed for the formation of the unique organometalic Co-C bond of adenosylcobalamin. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro data suggest that cobalamin reductases identified thus far are most likely electron transfer proteins, not enzymes."

Misannotations can be easily generated and propagated through databases by functional transfer based on sequence homology. We developed and optimized an automatic policing method to detect biochemical misannotations using context genomic correlations. The method works by finding genes with unusually weak genomic correlations in their assigned network positions. We demonstrate the accuracy of the method using a cross-validated approach. In addition, we show that the method identifies a significant number of potential misannotations in Bacillus subtilis, including metabolic assignments already shown to be incorrect experimentally. The experimental analysis of the mispredicted genes forming the leucine degradation pathway in B. subtilis demonstrates that computational policing tools can generate important biological hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W1976842829,"Ezrin links cortical actin filaments with the cell membrane, and has a critical role in many membrane-initiated events. Fas is directly associated with ezrin, but conflicting results have been reported for the involvement of ezrin in Fas-induced cell death. In this study we show that ezrin was associated with Fas in T cells before stimulation and was released shortly after Fas ligand (FasL) engagement. The knockdown of ezrin moderately increased Fas-triggered or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-triggered cell death in normal T lymphocytes and in H9 cells, but had no effect on death receptor-induced apoptosis in type II cells, such as Jurkat and CEM. Expression of a dominant-negative form of ezrin also led to an increased Fas-induced apoptosis in H9 cells. Ezrin deficiency did not affect the internalization of Fas after Fas ligation. Instead, an enhanced formation of death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) was observed in H9 cells with ezrin knockdown, leading to accelerated caspase-8 activation. Together, our results suggest that ezrin has a negative role in the recruitment of Fas into signaling complexes in type I T cells. Loss of ezrin likely removes the constraint imposed by ezrin and facilitates the assembly of death receptor complex in T cells."

Nitric oxide causes extensive but reversible cellular damage. In response to nitric oxide, the cell activates pathways for functional recovery and adaptation as well as pathways that direct β-cell death. The molecular events that dictate cellular fate following nitric oxide-induced damage are currently unknown. In this study, we provide evidence that AMPK plays a primary role controlling the response of β-cells to nitric oxide-induced damage. AMPK is transiently activated by nitric oxide in insulinoma cells and rat islets following IL-1 treatment or by the exogenous addition of nitric oxide. Active AMPK promotes the functional recovery of β-cell oxidative metabolism and abrogates the induction of pathways that mediate cell death such as caspase-3 activation following exposure to nitric oxide.

https://openalex.org/W2063380434,"One of the pivotal functions of endogenous tumor suppression is to oppose aberrant cell survival, but the molecular requirements of this process are not completely understood. Here, we show that caspase 2, a death effector with largely unknown functions, represses transcription of the survivin gene, a general regulator of cell division and cytoprotection in tumors. This pathway involves caspase 2 proteolytic cleavage of the nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) activator, RIP1. In turn, loss of RIP1 abolishes transcription of NFkappaB target genes, including survivin, resulting in deregulated mitotic transitions, enhanced apoptosis and suppression of tumorigenicity in vivo. Therefore, caspase 2 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of NFkappaB-dependent cell survival and this mechanism may contribute to tumor suppression in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1537300910,"Reactive oxygen species are known to participate in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways, including activation of NF-κB. Recent studies have indicated that increases in intracellular concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have anti-inflammatory effects in neutrophils, including inhibition of the degradation of IκBα after TLR4 engagement. In the present experiments, we found that culture of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neutrophils and HEK 293 cells with H2O2 resulted in diminished ubiquitination of IκBα and decreased SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase activity. Exposure of neutrophils or HEK 293 cells to H2O2 was associated with reduced binding between phosphorylated IκBα and SCFβ-TrCP but no change in the composition of the SCFβ-TrCP complex. Lipopolysaccharide-induced SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase activity as well as binding of β-TrCP to phosphorylated IκBα was decreased in the lungs of acatalasemic mice and mice treated with the catalase inhibitor aminotriazole, situations in which intracellular concentrations of H2O2 are increased. Exposure to H2O2 resulted in oxidative modification of cysteine residues in β-TrCP. Cysteine 308 in Blade 1 of the β-TrCP β-propeller region was found to be required for maximal binding between β-TrCP and phosphorylated IκBα. These findings suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of H2O2 may result from its ability to decrease ubiquitination as well as subsequent degradation of IκBα through inhibiting the association between IκBα and SCFβ-TrCP.

https://openalex.org/W2075374049,"The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-beta/delta (PPAR-beta/delta) in the pathogenesis of colon cancer remains highly controversial. This study specifically silenced the PPAR-beta expression in three colon cancer cell lines with different metastatic potentials. Although PPAR-beta knockdown resulted in more malignant morphological changes, bigger colony sizes and lower carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) secretion, and enhanced the cell-fibronectin adhesion, cell invasion and migration were unaffected. These effects were stronger in poorly metastatic cell lines compared with highly metastatic ones. Simultaneously, PPAR-beta knockdown decreased the mRNAs encoding adipocyte differentiation-related protein and liver fatty acid binding protein, and increased the mRNA of ILK, whereas the mRNAs encoding integrin-beta1 and angiopoietin-like 4 were unchanged. Using immunohistochemistry, we determined that the intensity of PPAR-beta expression was stronger in rectal cancers with better differentiation than in those with poor differentiation, and was stronger in early-stage tumors than in advanced ones. Together, these findings consistently indicate that PPAR-beta may facilitate differentiation and inhibit the cell-fibronectin adhesion of colon cancer, having a role as an inhibitor in the carcinogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer. Interestingly, PPAR-beta seems to have a more important role in poorly metastatic cells than in highly metastatic ones."
https://openalex.org/W1967124582,"Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases, MSK1 and the closely related isoform MSK2, are nuclear kinases that are activated following mitogen stimulation or cellular stress, including UV radiation, by the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling cascades, respectively. However, factors that differentially regulate MSK1 and MSK2 have not been well characterized. Here we report that the CK2 protein kinase, which contributes to NF-kappaB activation following UV radiation in a p38-dependent manner, physically interacts with MSK2 but not MSK1 and that CK2 inhibition specifically impairs UV-induced MSK2 kinase activation. A putative site of CK2 phosphorylation was mapped to MSK2 residue Ser(324) and when substituted to alanine (S324A) also compromised MSK2 activity. RNA interference-mediated depletion of MSK2 in human MDA-MB-231 cells, but not MSK1 depletion, resulted in impaired UV-induced phosphorylation of NF-kappaB p65 at Ser(276) in vivo, which was restored by the ectopic expression of MSK2 but not by MSK2-S324A. Furthermore, UV radiation led to the activation of NF-kappaB-responsive gene expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and induced p65 transactivation capacity that was dependent on MSK2, MSK2 residue Ser(324), and p65-Ser(276). These results suggest that MSK1 and MSK2 are differentially regulated by CK2 during the UV response and that MSK2 is the major protein kinase responsible for the UV-induced phosphorylation of p65 at Ser(276) that positively regulates NF-kappaB activity in MDA-MB-231 cells."

We show the molecular basis of the flexibility mechanism of VP2, the capsid protein of the double-stranded RNA virus infectious bursal disease virus. The initial assembly, a procapsid-like structure, is built by the protein precursor pVP2 and requires VP3, the other infectious bursal disease virus major structural protein, which acts as a scaffold. The pVP2 C-terminal region, which is proteolyzed during virus maturation, contains an amphipathic α-helix that acts as a molecular switch. In the absence of VP3, efficient virus-like particle assembly occurs when the structural unit is a VP2-based chimeric protein with an N-terminal-fused His6 tag. The His tag has a positively charged N terminus and a negatively charged C terminus, both important for virion-like structure assembly. The charge distributions of the VP3 C terminus and His tag are similar. We tested whether the His tag emulates the role of VP3 and found that the presence of a VP3 C-terminal peptide in VP2-based chimeric proteins resulted in the assembly of virus-like particles. We analyzed the electrostatic interactions between these two charged morphogenetic peptides, in which a single residue was mutated to impede the predicted interaction, followed by a compensatory double mutation to rescue electrostatic interactions. The effects of these mutations were monitored by following the virus-like and/or virus-related assemblies.

IntroductionViruses represent an elegant example of spontaneous self-assembly. There are nonetheless fundamental differences between natural crystals and viruses; a crystal is a continuous three-dimensional network without size limits, whereas viruses build a container with a defined cargo space for nucleic acid packaging in a biologically feasible time frame (1Zlotnick A. J. Mol. Recognit. 2005; 18: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Based on the basic principles of crystal growth, viruses require additional mechanisms to control their dimensions (2Johnson J.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 163: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of capsid structural subunits has built-in conformational flexibility; this allows it to maintain slightly different intersubunit contacts and facilitates acquisition of distinct spatial conformations (3Gertsman I. Gan L. Guttman M. Lee K. Speir J.A. Duda R.L. Hendrix R.W. Komives E.A. Johnson J.E. Nature. 2009; 458: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Cardone G. Purdy J.G. Cheng N. Craven R.C. Steven A.C. Nature. 2009; 457: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, viruses can use cell (membrane-specific regions, chaperones, etc.) or viral components (scaffolding, accessory, and proteolytic proteins) to facilitate subunit interactions, resulting in the generation of transient conformations (5Steven A.C. Heymann J.B. Cheng N. Trus B.L. Conway J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Dokland T. Structure Fold.

Segment A (3.2 kbp) has two partially overlapping open reading frames; the first codes for the nonessential VP5 protein, and the second encodes a polyprotein. Segment B (2.8 kbp) is monocistronic and encodes VP1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (9von Einem U.I. Gorbalenya A.E. Schirrmeier H. Behrens S.E. Letzel T. Mundt E. J. Gen.

By strict geometric considerations, VP2 trimers adopt five distinct conformations. Although the most abundant assembly in an IBDV-infected cell corresponds to T = 13 particles, other minor aberrant assemblies are found in vivo, such as tubular structures and smaller T = 1 icosahedral capsids (Fig. 1A). Expression of mature VP2 alone results in the spontaneous assembly of T = 1 subviral particles built of 20 VP2 trimers arranged into pentamers, whereas pVP2 or intermediate pVP2 variant expression leads to tubular structures with a hexagonal lattice (20Saugar I.

These IBDV-related structures are formed by the same structural building block, (p)VP2 trimers. The pVP2 71-residue C-terminal domain has an important role in allowing the formation of diverse VP2 conformations (27Castón J.R. Martínez-Torrecuadrada J.L. Maraver A. Lombardo E. Rodríguez J.F. Casal J.I. Carrascosa J.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 10815-10828Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This ability resides specifically in the 443GFKDIIRAIR452 amphipathic α-helix, referred to as helix α5. VP2 polypeptides with this α-helix assemble into genuine virus-like particles (VLPs) only when expressed as a chimeric protein with an N-terminal His tag (chimeric proteins His-VP2-456 and His-VP2-466) (20Saugar I.

Previous observations suggested that VP3 must also contribute to the inherent ability of pVP2 to acquire distinct conformations. VP3 mutants with alterations in or deletions of C-terminal residues (30Chevalier C. Lepault J. Da Costa B. Delmas B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3296-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or entirely lacking the last 13 residues (18Maraver A. Oña A. Abaitua F. González D. Clemente R. Ruiz-Díaz J.A. Castón J.R. Pazos F. Rodríguez J.F. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 6438-6449Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) thus fail to support assembly of (p)VP2 into T = 13 capsids, and hexagonal tubular or aberrant assemblies are formed. It was hypothesized that the His tag emulates the role of VP3 during morphogenesis, mimicking the VP3 C-terminal region closely (Fig. 1B). Although the α5-helix is a conformational switch responsible for the inherent structural polymorphism of VP2, its presence alone is insufficient to support this polymorphism. A His tag is nonetheless essential for production of genuine virus-like structures and acts as an α5-helix-triggering factor.The VP2 atomic structure was solved by x-ray crystallography of the T = 1 subviral particle capsids (28Coulibaly F. Chevalier C. Gutsche I. Pous J. Navaza J. Bressanelli S. Delmas B. Rey F.A. Cell. 2005; 120: 761-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 31Lee C.C. Ko T.P. Chou C.C.

Castón J.R. Rodríguez J.F. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 6895-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The VP2 subunit folds into three domains termed projection (P), shell (S), and base (B). Domains S and P are β-barrels with a jelly roll topology. The B domain is formed by α-helices facing the interior of the shell, corresponding to its N and C termini. The helical C-terminal arm of VP2 establishes domain swapping and mediates interactions between adjacent VP2 trimers, increasing their stability (Fig. 1C).Here, we show that assembly control of the IBDV T = 13 capsid requires electrostatic interactions between two morphogenetic polypeptide elements, provided independently by the major structural proteins (p)VP2 and VP3. In addition, acidic stretches in the His tag and the VP3 C-terminal residues are preceded by a basic segment, which has an additional role during capsid assembly.DISCUSSIONAssembly of large macromolecular complexes is frequently assisted by one or more auxiliary proteins that act as morphogenetic factors, controlling structural polymorphism and triggering structural changes. IBDV capsid assembly provides an excellent model system in which to study the coordination of factors involved in a multistep process that rarely leads to nonviable structures in vivo. Understanding these molecular interactions is necessary for the design of strategies that inhibit viral assembly or misdirect it into noninfectious aberrant structures (38Zlotnick A. Lee A. Bourne C.R. Johnson J.M. Domanico P.L. Stray S.J. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 490-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The T = 13 IBDV capsid (20Saugar I. Luque D. Oña A. Rodríguez J.F.

Borisov A.V. Crowther R.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 325-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is formed exclusively by VP2 trimers in five distinct conformations. This conformational flexibility is due to the transient presence of the pVP2 C-terminal region, specifically the 443–452 amphipathic α-helix (20Saugar I. Luque D. Oña A. Rodríguez J.F. Carrascosa J.L. Trus B.L. Castón J.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which acts as an inherent molecular switch. VP3, the other major structural protein, also participates in this process, acting as a scaffold protein (21Oña A. Luque D. Abaitua F. Maraver A. Castón J.R. Rodríguez J.F. Virology. 2004; 322: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Assembly pathways have classically been analyzed in detail from the purified critical proteins which, when mixed together in vitro, assemble into particles that closely resemble procapsids and/or capsids. Using a simple chimeric protein system, we found previously that in the absence of VP3, short VP2 variants containing the amphipathic α-helix assemble into T = 13 capsids only when fused to an N-terminal His tag (20Saugar I. Luque D. Oña A. Rodríguez J.F. Carrascosa J.L. Trus B.L. Castón J.R. Structure. 2005; 13: 1007-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the His tag effectively emulates the function of the VP3 C terminus because both peptides can be functionally interchanged. We found that basic residues on the charged face of the pVP2 amphipathic α5-helix, whose replacement with aspartic acid abrogates VP2 polymorphism, interact with acidic residues at the VP3 C terminus. These electrostatic interactions were inferred by testing predictable compensatory double mutants in our minimal chimeric protein system. Additional mutation analysis of VP3 at its Arg-rich region, which precedes the acidic C-terminal residues, revealed an additional segment involved in capsid assembly. The results suggest that there are at least two distinct sets of interaction sites for the VP3 scaffold protein; one subset is needed for VP2 structural polymorphism, and the other might have a role in structural stabilization and/or preventing formation of nonviable structures. A similar situation was demonstrated for the scaffolding protein of the Salmonella phage P22 (39Parker M.H. Brouillette C.G. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8962-8970Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Parent K.N. Doyle S.M. Anderson E. Teschke C.M. Virology. 2005; 340: 33-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).Many studies over the last few years have shed light on IBDV capsid assembly and maturation. A spherical procapsid is initially assembled, as is also the case of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (41Villanueva R.A. Galaz J.L. Valdés J.A. Jashés M.M. Sandino A.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13829-13838Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). According to our hypothesis, the pVP2 coat protein coassembles with the VP3 scaffold polypeptide to form a double-layered structure, with pVP2 on the outer surface and VP3 facing the capsid interior. These contacts could be explained by electrostatic interactions between the VP3 C termini and the amphipathic α5-helices. Initial support for this hypothesis was derived from immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy experiments in insect cells expressing the IBDV polyprotein, which assembled as tubular structures visualized using VP2- and VP3-specific antibodies (33Martinez-Torrecuadrada J.L. Castón J.R. Castro M. Carrascosa J.L. Rodríguez J.F. Casal J.I. Virology. 2000; 278: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The stable VP3-pVP2 interaction directs assembly of pVP2 trimers into hexamers and retards pVP2 C-terminal domain processing. In this context, the slow postassembly maturation step sidesteps the natural tendency of mature VP2 to assemble into all-pentameric T = 1 subviral particle. If processing is rapid, the VP3 C-terminal region cannot interact with pVP2 or does so only weakly, and a pentamer is formed from VP2 trimers. We consider that the pentamers could be the nucleating centers for capsid assembly and that additional (host) factors might participate, for example, to supply pentameric VP2 trimers that bind VP3 molecules transiently for the growing procapsid.This assembly model is consistent with the puzzling VP3 stoichiometry inside the virion, which remains constant at ∼450 copies but is not icosahedrally ordered (8Luque D. Rivas G. Alfonso C. Carrascosa J.L. Rodríguez J.F. Castón J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2148-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Five classes of (p)VP2 trimeric capsomers (quasi-equivalent trimers) have been described (29Böttcher B. Kiselev N.A. Stel'Mashchuk V.Y. Perevozchikova N.A. Borisov A.V. Crowther R.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 325-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on their local environments in the T = 13 capsid (classes a–e). Class a trimers lie on the 5-fold icosahedral axis and make close contact with class b trimers, generating a-b dimers. Class e trimers, located at the strict 3-fold icosahedral axis, interact closely with surrounding class d trimers. Class c trimers make pairwise contact (c-c dimers) similar to a-b dimers. VP3 can assemble as a regular scaffold structure beneath the pVP2 procapsid, with a similar VP3:(p)VP2 ratio except at the pentameric vertices, where a-b dimers do not interact with counterpart VP3 molecules, resembling the incomplete T = 13 shells of reovirus (42Dryden K.A. Wang G. Yeager M. Nibert M.L. Coombs K.M. Furlong D.B. Fields B.N. Baker T.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1023-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar).During the initial steps of procapsid growth, many amino acids on the VP3 outer surface must be in close proximity with the inner basement of the VP2 S domain. The spatial disposition of VP3 might modulate the conformational flexibility of the amphipathic α5-helix, which is found in a “closed state” as a helical bundle in (p)VP2 pentamers or in an “open state” as a star in hexamers (43Luque D. Saugar I. Rodríguez J.F. Verdaguer N. Garriga D. Martín C.S. -Muriel J.A. Trus B.L. Carrascosa J.L. Castón J.R. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6869-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The numerous VP3 interactions with pVP2 are thus intimately coordinated with other molecular events that determine the coat protein maturation rate and consequently, pentamer and/or hexamer assembly.The numerous VP3 scaffold activities associated with its highly hydrophilic C terminus indicate that VP3 is a multitasking protein in capsid morphogenesis. There are many similarities with two well described phage systems, the E. coli phage ϕX174 and the phage P22 (44Fane B.A. Prevelige Jr., P.E. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 64: 259-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). VP3 function is much more complex, however, because it also has numerous activities during the viral life cycle. The VP3 C terminus, which also participates in VP1 incorporation into the capsid, serves as a transcriptional activator (22Garriga D. Navarro A. Querol-Audí J. Abaitua F. Rodríguez J.F. Verdaguer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20540-20545Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) because it removes the inherent structural blockade of RNA polymerase activity. In addition, the VP3 oligomerization domain maps within the 42 C-terminal residues of the polypeptide (23Maraver A. Clemente R. Rodríguez J.F. Lombardo E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2459-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Finally, VP3 is also an RNA-binding protein associated with the dsRNA genome (34Kochan G. Gonzalez D. Rodríguez J.F. Arch. Virol. 2003; 148: 723-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45Pedersen T. Skjesol A. Jørgensen J.B. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6652-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Viral maturation through defined steps might allow this VP3 multifunctionality; for example, most VP3 molecules are engaged to (p)VP2, but a small subset of molecules could be involved in VP1 incorporation into the capsid. Once the procapsid structure is fully assembled and closed, VP3 could be released and bind to genomic dsRNA. Studies currently under way suggest that host factors might also participate in the capsid assembly process. IntroductionViruses represent an elegant example of spontaneous self-assembly. There are nonetheless fundamental differences between natural crystals and viruses; a crystal is a continuous three-dimensional network without size limits, whereas viruses build a container with a defined cargo space for nucleic acid packaging in a biologically feasible time frame (1Zlotnick A. J. Mol. Recognit. 2005; 18: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Based on the basic principles of crystal growth, viruses require additional mechanisms to control their dimensions (2Johnson J.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2008; 163: 246-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of capsid structural subunits has built-in conformational flexibility; this allows it to maintain slightly different intersubunit contacts and facilitates acquisition of distinct spatial conformations (3Gertsman I. Gan L. Guttman M. Lee K. Speir J.A. Duda R.L. Hendrix R.W. Komives E.A. Johnson J.E. Nature. 2009; 458: 646-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 4Cardone G. Purdy J.G. Cheng N. Craven R.C. Steven A.C. Nature. 2009; 457: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, viruses can use cell (membrane-specific regions, chaperones, etc.) or viral components (scaffolding, accessory, and proteolytic proteins) to facilitate subunit interactions, resulting in the generation of transient conformations (5Steven A.C. Heymann J.B. Cheng N. Trus B.L. Conway J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 6Dokland T. Structure Fold. Des. 2000; 8: R157-R162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Spatial and transient conformations are achieved by the intrinsic structural polymorphism of the viral proteins. Here, we addressed the molecular basis of birnavirus spherical capsid assembly, which is necessary for infectious particle production. We describe the minimal elements that, through electrostatic interactions, allow many copies of the same infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) 5The abbreviations used are: IBDVinfectious bursal disease virusdsRNAdouble-stranded RNAVPviral proteinVLPvirus-like particlerVVrecombinant vaccinia virusrBVrecombinant baculovirusCtC-terminalh.p.i.hours postinfectionPIPESpiperazine-N,N′-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). capsid protein to acquire different conformations.Birnaviruses are a family of nonenveloped double-stranded (ds) RNA viruses with an icosahedral capsid (7Delmas B.

Most of our understanding of birnaviruses is based on studies of IBDV, an avian pathogen, and of infectious pancreatic necrosis virus, a fish pathogen.IBDV has a polyploid bipartite dsRNA genome (segments A and B) (8Luque D.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2148-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) that is packaged into a single virus particle. Segment A (3.2 kbp) has two partially overlapping open reading frames; the first codes for the nonessential VP5 protein, and the second encodes a polyprotein. Segment B (2.8 kbp) is monocistronic and encodes VP1, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (9von Einem U.I. Gorbalenya A.E. Schirrmeier H. Behrens S.E. Letzel T. Mundt E. J. Gen.

The polyprotein (1012 residues) is co-translationally self-cleaved by the viral protease VP4. This yields most of the structural proteins, including the capsid precursor protein pVP2, VP3, and VP4 (11Birghan C. Mundt E. Gorbalenya A.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 12Feldman A.R. Lee J. Delmas B. Paetzel M. J. Mol.

Rodríguez J.F. Virology. 1999; 262: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The resulting intermediates are further cleaved by VP2 itself (14Irigoyen N. Garriga D. Navarro A. Verdaguer N.

In humans, the number of pathways utilizing the 4-PP post-translational modification is limited and may only require a single broad specificity PPT for all phosphopantetheinylation reactions. Recently, we have shown that one of the enzymes of folate metabolism, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (FDH), requires a 4-PP prosthetic group for catalysis. This moiety acts as a swinging arm to couple the activities of the two catalytic domains of FDH and allows the conversion of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and CO2. In the current study, we demonstrate that the broad specificity human PPT converts apo-FDH to holoenzyme and thus activates FDH catalysis. Silencing PPT by small interfering RNA in A549 cells prevents FDH modification, indicating the lack of alternative enzymes capable of accomplishing this transferase reaction. Interestingly, PPT-silenced cells demonstrate significantly reduced proliferation and undergo strong G1 arrest, suggesting that the enzymatic function of PPT is essential and nonredundant. Our study identifies human PPT as the FDH-modifying enzyme and supports the hypothesis that mammals utilize a single enzyme for all phosphopantetheinylation reactions. 4′-Phosphopantetheinyl transferases (PPTs) catalyze the transfer of 4′-phosphopantetheine (4-PP) from coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue of their protein substrates.

Folate derivatives function as coenzymes in reactions involving the transfer of one-carbon units and participate in key metabolic processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis and the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine (1Wagner C. Bailey L.B. Folate in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 23-42Google Scholar). The intracellular folate pool consists of several major reduced folate forms, and the overall balance between different folates is maintained by numerous enzymes that incorporate one-carbon groups into the pool, convert these groups within the pool, or utilize them in biosynthetic reactions. One of the folate enzymes, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-fTHF) 2The abbreviations used are: 10-fTHF10-formyltetrahydrofolateFDH10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenaseTHFtetrahydrofolateNtamino-terminalCtcarboxyl-terminalIntDintermediate domain4-PP4′-phosphopantetheinePPT4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferaseACPacyl carrier proteinFASfatty acid synthasesiRNAsmall interfering RNARTreverse transcriptionMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromideFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorter. dehydrogenase (FDH, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1L1, EC 1.5.1.6), oxidizes the formyl group of 10-fTHF to yield tetrahydrofolate (THF) and CO2. This reaction requires NADP+ and proceeds through a complex multistep mechanism (2Krupenko S.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2009; 178: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). FDH is expressed in most tissues and is particularly abundant in the liver and kidney; in the former it is present at the level of about 1% of the total soluble cytosolic protein (3Kisliuk R.L. Jackman A.L. Antifolate Drugs in Cancer Therapy.

The FDH substrate, 10-fTHF, is used as a formyl group donor in two steps of de novo purine biosynthesis (4Smith G.K. Benkovic P.A. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 4034-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 5Boger D.L. Kochanny M.J. Cai H. Wyatt D. Kitos P.A. Warren M.S. Ramcharan J. Gooljarsingh L.T. Benkovic S.J. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1998; 6: 643-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The excess of 10-fTHF, not required for this pathway, can be utilized by FDH to replenish the THF pool, thus making folate available for other reactions of one-carbon metabolism. It has been proposed that the FDH reaction serves as a regulator of intracellular purine levels, preventing the excessive flux of one-carbon groups into this pathway (6Krupenko S.A. Oleinik N.V. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar). Several other metabolic functions have also been attributed to FDH, including storage of intracellular folate in the form of THF (7Fu T.F. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); detoxification of intracellular formic acid by removing it as CO2 (8Johlin F.C. Swain E. Smith C. Tephly T.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 745-750PubMed Google Scholar); and regulation of overall cellular methylation (9Anguera M.C. Field M.S. Perry C. Ghandour H. Chiang E.P.

FDH knock-out is not lethal, but mice lacking the enzyme exhibit low hepatic levels of THF and diminished reproductive efficiency (10Champion K.M. Cook R.J. Tollaksen S.L. Giometti C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 11338-11342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent studies have also implicated FDH as a potential contributor in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects (11Anthony T.E. Heintz N. J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 500: 368-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Of note, FDH is drastically and ubiquitously down-regulated in human cancers (6Krupenko S.A. Oleinik N.V. Cell Growth Differ. 2002; 13: 227-236PubMed Google Scholar), a finding that implies a role for the enzyme in controlling cellular proliferation. FDH is a tetramer of identical 99-kDa (902 amino acid residues) subunits (12Schirch D. Villar E. Maras B. Barra D. Schirch V. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24728-24735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each subunit consists of three distinct domains and is the product of the fusion of three unrelated genes (13Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain (Nt-FDH, residues 1–310) shares a structural and functional similarity with two other enzymes that use 10-fTHF as a substrate, methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (14Chumanevich A.A.

This domain contains the folate binding site and can hydrolyze 10-fTHF to produce THF and formate (15Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol.

The carboxyl-terminal domain (Ct-FDH, residues 401–902) has ∼50% identity to other aldehyde dehydrogenases and shares the general fold of class 1 and 2 aldehyde dehydrogenases (16Tsybovsky Y. Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Davies C. Krupenko S.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2917-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By itself, Ct-FDH carries an NADP+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and catalyzes the oxidation of short chain aldehydes into their respective carboxylic acids (13Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The two catalytic domains of FDH are connected by an intermediate domain (IntD, residues 310–400) which belongs to a family of carrier proteins (17Reuland S.N. Vlasov A.P. Krupenko S.A. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1076-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It was recently demonstrated that this region of FDH is post-translationally modified by the covalent attachment of 4′-phosphopantetheine (4-PP) at serine 354 (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the 4-PP prosthetic group functions as a swinging arm, in a manner similar to that of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), to transfer the formyl group of 10-fTHF from the Nt-FDH to the Ct-FDH where it is oxidized to CO2 (Fig. 1). Thus, the intermediate domain couples two catalytic activities to produce a novel enzymatic reaction (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). ACPs are members of the family of carrier proteins that contain the 4-PP modification and are involved in fatty acid, polyketide, and nonribosomal protein biosynthesis (19Walsh C.T. Gehring A.M. Weinreb P.H. Quadri L.E. Flugel R.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To date, human proteins shown to have the 4-PP modification include cytosolic fatty acid synthase (FAS) and mitochondrial ACP (20Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) as well as FDH (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In addition, α-aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the lysine degradation pathway, could be a subject for this type of modification (21Praphanphoj V. Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. Thomas G.H. Geraghty M.T. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 72: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The addition of 4-PP to a protein is catalyzed by 4-PP transferases (PPTs). These enzymes use coenzyme A as the donor of the 4-PP group, which is attached to a conserved serine residue of the carrier protein (22Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 23Elovson J. Vagelos P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3603-3611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PPTs have been classified into three different groups on the basis of their structural organization (24Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). So far, only one PPT gene has been identified in the human genome. It encodes a 329-residue monomeric enzyme that exhibits broad substrate specificity (25Bunkoczi G. Pasta S. Joshi A. Wu X. Kavanagh K.L. Smith S. Oppermann U. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1243-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This cytosolic enzyme is capable of modifying the ACP domain of FAS and mitochondrial ACP (20Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and has been also implicated in the modification of α-aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (21Praphanphoj V. Sacksteder K.A. Gould S.J. Thomas G.H. Geraghty M.T. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2001; 72: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is not clear, however, whether additional PPTs are present in humans. In this study, we demonstrate that FDH is a substrate for human PPT and that PPT siRNA silencing in a human cell line results in loss of the ability to modify FDH and produce active enzyme. These results give further support to the hypothesis that a single PPT is responsible for all 4-PP modifications in humans. Using available sequence data for PPT mRNA (GenBank accession no. 20357567), PCR primers (forward, 5′-ATG GTT TTC CCT GCC AAA C-3′; reverse, 5′-TCA TGA CTT TGT ACC ATT TC-3′) were designed to amplify full-length PPT cDNA from a human heart cDNA library (Clontech). The PCR product was cloned into a linearized pCR2.1 plasmid using a TA Cloning kit (Invitrogen). The fragment encoding PPT was subcloned into the pRSET-B expression vector immediately downstream of the His6 tag. The construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing at Medical University of South Carolina Nucleic Acid Analysis Facility. Expression of PPT was carried out in Escherichia coli as described elsewhere (25Bunkoczi G. Pasta S. Joshi A. Wu X. Kavanagh K.L. Smith S. Oppermann U. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1243-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the PPT/pRSET construct was transformed into E. coli (BL21(DE3)-codon plus strain; Stratagene), the cultures were grown to A600 = 0.6, and expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After induction, the culture was allowed to grow for 4 h at 20 °C with constant shaking. The protein was purified from lysed cells using a PrepEase His-Tagged Protein Purification kit (USB Corp.). Human FDH cDNA was amplified by PCR from human liver cDNA library (Clontech) and cloned into a pCR2.1 plasmid. The FDH coding sequence was further subcloned into a pRSET vector to generate a construct for expression of full-length enzyme with a His6 tag at the amino terminus (hFDH/pRSET). The enzyme was expressed in E. coli (BL21(DE3)-codon plus strain) at 20 °C and purified on a 5-fTHF affinity column as described previously (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The construct for expression of truncated FDH was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis to introduce a stop codon at residue 408 (mutagenic primer, 5′-GCA GCA TTG ACT AAG TGG AAT GGC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GCC ATT TCC ACT TAG TCA ATG CTG C-3′). To produce a protein that could not be derivatized at the 4-PP modification site, an additional S354A mutation was also introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (forward primer, 5′-CAG GGG CCG CGG CTG TGG ACG TTG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAA CGT CCA CAG CCG CGG CCC CTG-3′). 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity was measured spectrophotometrically as described previously (13Krupenko S.A. Wagner C. Cook R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10266-10272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-formyldideazafolate was used as a substrate in the assay in the presence of 100 μm NADP+. Absorbance was monitored at 295 nm and used to calculate the specific activity. The assays were conducted at 30 °C in a 1-cm quartz cuvette using a Shimadzu 2401PC double-beam spectrophotometer. Purified recombinant FDH (5 μm) was incubated with 1.4 μm purified recombinant PPT, 100 μm CoA, 70 mm MgCl2, and 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, at room temperature. At different time points (0–240 s), the reaction was quenched by the addition of 80 mm EDTA, and FDH activity was assayed. To determine the effect of PPT concentration on FDH reactivation, 0.008–10 μm PPT was added to a mixture of 4 μm FDH, 100 μm CoA, 50 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After incubation at room temperature for 1 min, the reaction was quenched by the addition of EDTA, and FDH activity was assayed. The fluorescent reporter, a fluorescein maleimide derivative of CoA, was synthesized as described previously (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26La Clair J.J. Foley T.L. Schegg T.R. Regan C.M. Burkart M.D. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter (20 μl) was added to 34 μg of purified recombinant FDH or its mutants expressed in E. coli and 32 μg of recombinant PPT in a 200-μl solution containing 20 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The mixture was incubated at room temperature, and 20-μl aliquots were removed at corresponding time points, immediately quenched by the addition of EDTA, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immediately following electrophoresis, the gel was imaged under UV light and then stained with Coomassie Blue. A digital image of the gel exposed to UV irradiation was used to quantify the percent of labeling using ImageJ software. A549 cells (1.7 × 105) were transfected with 50 nm of StealthTM RNA interference (Invitrogen) duplex (targeting the PPT sequence 5′-ACC UGA GCU GCA AGU UGG AAU UGA U-3′) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Scrambled StealthTM RNA interference was used as a negative control. PPT mRNA levels were evaluated using reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Total RNA for RT-PCR was isolated using RNA Easy Mini kit (Qiagen). The RT reaction was performed with an oligo(dT)18 primer using AdvantageTM RT-for-PCR kit (Clontech). PCR was carried out using PPT-specific primers (forward primer, 5′-ATG GTT TTC CCT GCC AAA CGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TCA TGA CTT TGT ACC ATT TCG-3′) and Pfu-Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). PPT protein levels were evaluated by immunoblot assays using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum (1:10,000) generated against pure recombinant human PPT. Cell lysates were obtained by mechanical disruption of a 100-μl suspension of 6 × 106 HEK293 or A549 cells using a Dounce homogenizer in the presence of a 10-μl protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). 150 μl of 50% glycerol was added to the mixture, and insoluble content was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 5 min. In a total volume of 55 μl, 7 μg of recombinant FDH was incubated with 20 μl of cell lysate, 4 μg of PPT, or water in the presence of 10 μl of fluorescent reporter in Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm MgCl2. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Cell viability was assessed using an MTT cell proliferation assay (Promega). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 103 cells/100 μl of medium in 96-well format, and MTT was added at the specified time points. Plates were further processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Absorbance at 570 nm was read using a Wallace 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide staining/FACS. Specifically, 1.0 × 106 cells were washed and pelleted. Pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed by the addition of 4 ml of 70% ethanol, and incubated at −20 °C overnight. Following centrifugation, samples were resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 40 μg/ml propidium iodide and 100 μg/ml RNase, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and samples were submitted for analysis by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was detected by annexin V labeling using an annexin V-FLUOS staining kit (Roche Applied Science). Annexin V/propidium iodide-stained cells were detected by flow cytometry carried out at the Hollings Cancer Center Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur. Data analysis was performed using CellQuest and Mod Fit software (Becton Dickinson). We have cloned PPT from a cDNA library generated using human heart mRNA. The PPT coding fragment was inserted into a pRSET vector in such a way that the expressed protein would have a His6 tag at the amino terminus separated from the first amino acid of PPT by a linker of four amino acid residues (Gly-Met-Ala-Ser). This construct was used for expression in E. coli as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recombinant PPT was expressed mostly as a soluble protein. The protein was purified from cell lysate to near homogeneity using metal affinity chromatography (Fig. 2A). Our previous studies have shown that recombinant FDH, expressed in E. coli, lacks dehydrogenase activity toward 10-fTHF but retains hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This phenomenon occurs because of the lack of modification of FDH with 4-PP in bacterial cells (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, this recombinant FDH is a suitable substrate for FDH-specific PPT because it exists as an apoenzyme. To study whether human PPT can phosphopantetheinylate FDH, recombinant PPT was incubated with E. coli-expressed, recombinant FDH in the presence of CoA and MgCl2. It was observed that recombinant PPT enables the FDH enzyme to accomplish 10-fTHF dehydrogenase catalysis. Activation of FDH proceeded in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Maximum enzymatic activation was achieved in about 2 min, and the FDH activity did not change further. To determine the effective concentrations of PPT toward FDH as a substrate, FDH activation was evaluated (as reconstituted dehydrogenase activity) after a 1-min incubation using variable amounts of PPT and an excess of CoA (Fig. 2C). These experiments indicated that FDH phosphopantetheinylation proceeds efficiently at low micromolar concentrations of both proteins; a nonlinear regression analysis of our data revealed that 1.22 μm PPT can modify 50% of FDH under the reaction conditions. To demonstrate directly the ability of PPT to modify FDH covalently, a CoA-derived fluorescent reporter was synthesized as described previously (26La Clair J.J. Foley T.L. Schegg T.R. Regan C.M. Burkart M.D. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 195-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reporter allows for the study of proteins undergoing phosphopantetheinylation and consists of the fluorescent label, fluorescein maleimide, attached to the sulfhydryl group of the 4-PP part of CoA (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). E. coli-expressed FDH was incubated with recombinant PPT in the presence of the fluorescent reporter and MgCl2, and this reaction was quenched at various time points using EDTA to chelate Mg2+ ions from the solution as they are required for the PPT reaction to proceed. SDS-PAGE and UV irradiation demonstrated incorporation of the fluorescent label into FDH in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3, A and B). Maximum labeling of recombinant FDH was achieved after 12 min. It has been reported previously that FDH is modified with 4-PP at serine 354. To confirm that PPT modifies FDH at this specific residue, PPT was incubated with an S354A mutant enzyme composed of Nt-FDH and IntD (Nt-FDH/IntD) in the presence of the fluorescent reporter and MgCl2 (Fig. 3C). As a control, wild-type Nt-FDH/IntD was incubated with recombinant PPT in a separate reaction mixture. These experiments revealed incorporation of the fluorescent label into wild-type apoenzyme but not S354A mutant FDH, thus confirming that PPT modifies FDH at this specific serine residue. Our previous studies have shown that lysate from Sf9 insect cells can modify recombinant FDH with the CoA-derived fluorescent reporter (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that mammalian cells can accomplish this modification, recombinant FDH was incubated with lysates from HEK293 and A549 cells in the presence of the reporter. The results of this experiment showed that extracts from both cell lines are able to modify a significant portion of FDH with the fluorescent reporter (Fig. 4A). It has been proposed that there is only one enzyme responsible for all phosphopantetheinylation reactions in mammals (20Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we used an siRNA approach to knockdown PPT. PPT silencing was efficient, lasting from 24 to 96 h post-transfection, with a strong decrease in both PPT mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 4, B and C). To test whether other cellular enzymes can modify FDH, lysate from PPT-silenced A549 cells was incubated with E. coli-expressed FDH and the fluorescent reporter (Fig. 4D). These experiments revealed that depletion of PPT leads to decreased covalent modification of FDH by the cell extracts. This finding suggests that PPT is the only mammalian enzyme responsible for activating FDH and that silencing PPT is sufficient to inhibit phosphopantetheinylation of FDH. We have also evaluated the effect of PPT silencing on cellular proliferation. MTT proliferation assays have demonstrated that cells with depleted PPT have a decreased proliferation rate: at 96 h post-transfection ∼50% fewer viable cells were observed in PPT siRNA-transfected preparations than in control preparations transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 5A). Strong G0/G1 arrest became noticeable in PPT-deficient cells as early as 24 h post-transfection (Fig. 5B). However, an annexin V assay revealed that PPT-silenced cells did not undergo apoptosis (Fig. 5C). The two catalytic subunits of FDH communicate via an intermediate domain that is a structural and functional homolog of carrier proteins (2Krupenko S.A. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2009; 178: 84-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Like other carrier proteins, its characteristic feature is a modification with a 4-PP group, which takes place at serine 354 in the case of FDH. In FAS, the prosthetic group works as a swinging arm, transferring acyl substrates between the different catalytic sites involved in fatty acid biosynthesis. In the mechanism of FDH catalysis, 4-PP transfers a formyl group from the amino-terminal hydrolase domain to the carboxyl-terminal aldehyde dehydrogenase domain, thus coupling the two catalytic activities into one reaction (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Covalent modification of proteins with 4-PP, originating from CoA, is an enzymatic process that is catalyzed by 4-PP transferases. The enzyme responsible for the phosphopantetheinylation of FDH has not been reported previously; however, only one PPT has currently been identified in mammals (20Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that the previously reported human PPT, which modifies acyl carrier proteins, is also responsible for phosphopantetheinylating FDH. We have shown previously that recombinant FDH, expressed in bacteria, lacks 4-PP modification and is therefore incapable of catalyzing the 10-fTHF dehydrogenase reaction (18Donato H. Krupenko N.I. Tsybovsky Y. Krupenko S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34159-34166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). At the same time, E. coli-expressed FDH retained full hydrolase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity (Fig. 1). In our experiments, incubation of this enzyme with purified recombinant human PPT in the presence of CoA and Mg2+ restored 10-fTHF dehydrogenase activity. Using a CoA-derived fluorescent reporter, we have also directly demonstrated that recombinant PPT can modify FDH in vitro. Phosphopantetheinylation by PPT occurs specifically at serine 354 of FDH because replacement of this serine with alanine prevented this covalent modification. Although this finding demonstrated that FDH is a substrate for PPT, it did not exclude the possibility that other mammalian enzymes could catalyze the phosphopantetheinylation. Indeed, based on the discovery of multiple PPTs in E. coli, it was proposed that individual carrier proteins were phosphopantetheinylated by target-specific PPTs (27Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Further analysis of prokaryotic PPTs led to their classification into three distinct classes. Class 1 PPTs, homotrimers with active sites located at the junction between each subunit (28Parris K.D. Lin L. Tam A. Mathew R. Hixon J. Stahl M. Fritz C.C. Seehra J. Somers W.S. Structure. 2000; 8: 883-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), modify bacterial carrier proteins associated with fatty acid and polyketide synthesis (29Gehring A.M. Lambalot R.H. Vogel K.W. Drueckhammer D.G. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 17-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Class 2 PPTs are exemplified by the Sfp enzyme of Bacillus subtilis, which is capable of recognizing a broad spectrum of carrier proteins (24Mootz H.D. Finking R. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37289-37298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although class 2 PPTs are monomers consisting of two domains, structural comparison between class 1 and 2 PPTs has demonstrated that they have comparable domain architecture despite the lack of sequence similarity (30Chirgadze N.Y. Briggs S.L. McAllister K.A. Fischl A.S. Zhao G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5281-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Class 3 PPTs are distinct in that they constitute a specific enzymatic domain integrated within a larger, multifunctional protein, and the PPT of FAS2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the prototypical example (31Fichtlscherer F. Wellein C. Mittag M. Schweizer E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2666-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Lower organisms often encode multiple PPTs; yeast, for instance, contain representatives of all three classes (20Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, some organisms appear to utilize only one PPT to accomplish their phosphopantetheinylation reactions (20Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, mammals may not require multiple PPTs because they lack nonribosomal peptide and polyketide synthesis. In agreement with this paradigm, there is only one PPT in humans (20Joshi A.K. Zhang L. Rangan V.S. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33142-33149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), which is functionally and structurally similar to the broad-specificity Sfp enzyme of B. subtilis (25Bunkoczi G. Pasta S. Joshi A. Wu X. Kavanagh K.L. Smith S. Oppermann U. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1243-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The existence of additional mammalian PPTs, however, could not be excluded completely. Importantly, the results of our PPT knockdown experiments not only support the role of the enzyme in FDH modification but also indicate that this PPT is the only enzyme with this type of activity in humans. It would be expected that FDH and other carrier proteins have a common consensus motif if they are modified by the same enzyme. Such a motif though is not apparent from the sequence analysis. The recently solved crystal structure of human PPT in complex with the ACP domain of FAS provides an explanation of how the enzyme can recognize different targets. It appears that PPT target specificity relies on the overall shape of the ACP domain rather than on interactions with particular peptide motif (25Bunkoczi G. Pasta S. Joshi A. Wu X. Kavanagh K.L. Smith S. Oppermann U. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1243-1253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, PPT interacts with ACP over a large hydrophobic interface. Interestingly, replacement of three hydrophobic residues, situated immediately downstream of the modified serine (Leu2157, Met2158, and Val2160), to alanine reduces the Km by at least 3 orders of magnitude, indicating that this hydrophobic patch is important for PPT substrate recognition. Although the corresponding motif in FDH is different from in ACP (VDVV versus LMSV, respectively), the overall hydrophobicity of the region is preserved and thus might be important for PPT binding. An additional argument in favor of a single PPT in humans is that PPT silencing has a profound effect on cellular proliferation, resulting in a strong G1 cell cycle arrest. Such an effect should not be expected if the PPT activity was redundant. Although PPT silencing perhaps inhibits all phosphopantetheinylation processes in the cell, the antiproliferative effects are most likely associated with impairment of fatty acid biosynthesis. Indeed, siRNA silencing of FAS or treatment of tumor cells with orlistat (a potent inhibitor of the thioesterase catalysis of FAS) results in a phenotype similar to that observed with knockdown of PPT, including arrest of G1/S progression and inhibition of cellular proliferation (32Knowles L.M. Axelrod F. Browne C.D. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30540-30545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Of note, siRNA FAS silencing or orlistat treatment of tumor cells induces apoptosis (33Knowles L.M. Yang C. Osterman A. Smith J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31378-31384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), an effect not observed with PPT silencing in our studies, possibly because of the presence of still modified ACP, and therefore active FAS, in the cell. However, it should be expected that a mouse knockout of PPT would be embryonic lethal, similar to knockout of FAS (34Chirala S.S. Chang H. Matzuk M. Abu-Elheiga L. Mao J. Mahon K. Finegold M. Wakil S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Whether limited availability of PPT under normal or pathological conditions could result in the accumulation of inactive apo-FDH is unclear. In E. coli, for example, apo-ACP is undetectable as an intermediate in ACP biosynthesis, suggesting rapid protein modification following translation (35Jackowski S. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 15186-15191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that most FDH in the cell also exists in the phosphopantetheinylated form. The enzyme, processed to holo form, could also be targeted by reactive metabolites at the 4-PP group, resulting in inhibition of activity. In this regard, it has been shown in animal studies that acetaminophen treatment or chronic ethanol ingestion decreases the hepatic activity of FDH (36Pumford N.R. Halmes N.C. Martin B.M. Cook R.J.

Res. 2005; 29: 2188-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This was attributed to the inactivation of the enzyme caused by the addition of reactive metabolites to cysteine 707, a critical catalytic residue (36Pumford N.R. Halmes N.C. Martin B.M. Cook R.J.

It is more likely, however, that these adducts are formed with the sulfhydryl group of the 4-PP moiety, which should be easily accessible. Whether FDH, derivatized at its 4-PP group, can be repaired by subsequent removal of inactivated 4-PP and remodification with a fresh group remains a question for future investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2114678438,"Studies in yeast have shown that a deficiency in Atp12p prevents assembly of the extrinsic domain (F(1)) of complex V and renders cells unable to make ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. De Meirleir et al. (De Meirleir, L., Seneca, S., Lissens, W., De Clercq, I., Eyskens, F., Gerlo, E., Smet, J., and Van Coster, R. (2004) J. Med. Genet. 41, 120-124) have reported that a homozygous missense mutation in the gene for human Atp12p (HuAtp12p), which replaces Trp-94 with Arg, was linked to the death of a 14-month-old patient. We have investigated the impact of the pathogenic W94R mutation on Atp12p structure/function. Plasmid-borne wild type human Atp12p rescues the respiratory defect of a yeast ATP12 deletion mutant (Deltaatp12). The W94R mutation alters the protein at the most highly conserved position in the Pfam sequence and renders HuAtp12p insoluble in the background of Deltaatp12. In contrast, the yeast protein harboring the corresponding mutation, ScAtp12p(W103R), is soluble in the background of Deltaatp12 but not in the background of Deltaatp12Deltafmc1, a strain that also lacks Fmc1p. Fmc1p is a yeast mitochondrial protein not found in higher eukaryotes. Tryptophan 94 (human) or 103 (yeast) is located in a positively charged region of Atp12p, and hence its mutation to arginine does not alter significantly the electrostatic properties of the protein. Instead, we provide evidence that the primary effect of the substitution is on the dynamic properties of Atp12p."
https://openalex.org/W2005295709,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β and C/EBP sites in the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) are crucial for HIV-1 replication in monocyte/macrophages and for the ability of interferon β (IFNβ) to inhibit ongoing active HIV replication in these cells. This IFNβ-mediated down-regulation involves induction of the truncated, dominant-negative isoform of C/EBPβ referred to as liver-enriched transcriptional inhibitory protein (LIP). Although binding of the C/EBPβ isoform to C/EBP sites in the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) LTR has previously been examined, the importance of these sites in core promoter-mediated transcription, virus replication, IFNβ-mediated regulation, and the relative binding of the two isoforms (C/EBPβ and LIP) has not been investigated. Here, we specifically examine two C/EBP sites, JC1 (−100 bp) and DS1 (+134 bp), located within the minimal region of the SIV LTR, required for core promoter-mediated transcription and virus replication in macrophages. Our studies revealed that the JC1 but not DS1 C/EBP site is important for basal level transcription, whereas the DS1 C/EBP site is imperative for productive virus replication in primary macrophages. In contrast, either JC1 or DS1 C/EBP site is sufficient to mediate IFNβ-induced down-regulation of SIV LTR activity and virus replication in these cells. We also characterized the differential binding properties of C/EBPβ and LIP to the JC1 and DS1 sites. In conjunction with previous studies from our laboratory, we demonstrate the importance of these sites in virus gene expression, and we propose a model for their role in establishing latency and persistence in macrophages in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2044327255,"Prm1 is a pheromone-induced membrane glycoprotein that promotes plasma membrane fusion in yeast mating pairs. HA-Prm1 migrates at twice its expected molecular weight on non-reducing SDS-PAGE gels and coprecipitates with Prm1-TAP, indicating that Prm1 is a disulfide-linked homodimer. The N terminus of a plasma membrane-localized GFP-Prm1 endocytic mutant projects into the cytoplasm, where it is protected from low pH quenching in live cells and from external protease in spheroplasts. In a revised topological map, Prm1 has four transmembrane domains and two large extracellular loops. Mutation of all four cysteines in the extracellular loops blocked disulfide bond formation and destabilized the Prm1 homodimer without preventing Prm1 transport to contact sites in mating pairs. Cys(120) in loop 1 and Cys(545) in loop 2 form disulfide cross-links in the Prm1 homodimer and are required for fusion activity. Cys(120) lies between a hydrophobic segment formerly thought to be a transmembrane domain and an amphipathic helix. An interaction between either of these regions and the opposing membrane could promote fusion."

https://openalex.org/W2019101529,"The function of the ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel relies on the proper coupling between its two subunits: the pore-forming Kir6.2 and the regulator SUR. The conformation of the interface between these two subunits can be monitored using a rhodamine 123 (Rho) protection assay because Rho blocks Kir6.2 with an efficiency that depends on the relative position of transmembrane domain (TMD) 0 of the associated SUR (Hosy, E., Dérand, R., Revilloud, J., and Vivaudou, M.

The activating mutation F132L in SUR1, which causes neonatal diabetes, also rendered the channel resistant to Rho block, suggesting that it stabilized an activated conformation by uncoupling TMD0 from the rest of SUR1. At a nearby residue, the SUR1 mutation E128K impairs trafficking, thereby reducing surface expression and causing hyperinsulinism. To augment channel density at the plasma membrane to investigate the effect of mutating this residue on channel function, we introduced the milder mutation E126A at the matching residue of SUR2A. Mutation E126A imposed a hypersensitive Rho phenotype indicative of a functional uncoupling between TMD0 and Kir6.2. These results suggest that the TMD0-Kir6.2 interface is mobile and that the gating modes of Kir6.2 correlate with distinct positions of TMD0.

Prost A.L. Dérand R. Vivaudou M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Four Kir6s form a potassium-selective pore that is inhibited by intracellular ATP. This pore is surrounded by four SURs that allosterically relieve ATP inhibition of Kir6 in response to intracellular MgADP (2Nichols C.G. Nature. 2006; 440: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 3Alekseev A.E. Hodgson D.M. Karger A.B. Park S. Zingman L.V. Terzic A. J. Mol. Cell.

The balance of these two effects causes the channel to open when ATP consumption exceeds supply and to close when cellular energy reserves are replenished. This property allows the KATP channel to function as a metabolic sensor that transduces cellular energy variations into bioelectrical signals. In pancreatic β-cells, the KATP channel is a pivotal element in the cascade that links insulin secretion to glucose concentration. When glycaemia rises, metabolism causes a rise in ATP and a decrease in ADP. This tends to close the channel, causing membrane depolarization, calcium entry, and exocytosis of insulin granules (4Ashcroft F.M. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E880-E889Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). ATP-sensitive potassium channels sulfonylurea receptor transmembrane domain nucleotide-binding domain rhodamine 123 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Because of this pivotal role, the KATP channel is a prime target for pharmacological intervention to correct insulin secretion dysfunction, and there exist a number of molecules, several in clinical use, that are able to block or activate the channel by binding to SUR. The KATP channel is also the source of diseases when genetic mutations alter its proper function. For the pancreatic channel made of the isoforms SUR1 and Kir6.2, mutations in either subunit have been identified that disable the channel, causing hyperinsulinism, or that hyperactivate the channel, causing diabetes (5Flanagan S.E. Clauin S. Bellanné-Chantelot C. de Lonlay P. Harries L.W. Gloyn A.L. Ellard S. Hum. Mutat. 2009; 30: 170-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). SUR belongs to the ATP-binding cassette protein family. Like other ATP-binding cassette proteins, it is composed of two transmembrane domains: TMD1 and TMD2, and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains: NBD1 and NBD2 (1Moreau C. Prost A.L. Dérand R. Vivaudou M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38: 951-963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Essential to its function as a channel regulator is the supplementary N-terminal transmembrane domain TMD0 predicted to contain five transmembrane helices (supplemental Fig. S1). TMD0 tightly associates with Kir6.2 and modulates its gating (6Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Other domains of SUR also interact with Kir6.2: TMD2-NBD2, which co-immunoprecipitates with Kir6.2 (7Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and a cytoplasmic region at the TMD2-NBD2 junction (8Rainbow R.D. James M. Hudman D. Al Johi M. Singh H.

Physiol. 2008; 586: 3075-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On the Kir6.2 side of the interaction, it is hard to identify a specific region of association because biochemical evidence is lacking. The outer helix TM1 is a potential region of physical interaction (10Schwappach B. Zerangue N. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 2000; 26: 155-167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), whereas the N terminus is clearly involved in functional coupling with SUR (6Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43997-44004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Indeed, the Kir6.2 N terminus can transduce force into gating change as we recently demonstrated by coupling neurotransmitter receptors to Kir6.2 (13Moreau C.J. Dupuis J.P. Revilloud J. Arumugam K. Vivaudou M. Nature Nanotech. 2008; 3: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this work, we examine the functional coupling between Kir6.2 and SUR1 or the cardiac isoform SUR2A using a rhodamine protection assay (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that permits us to dynamically probe the conformation of the contact between TMD0 of SUR and Kir6.2. We investigate how the SUR-Kir6.2 interface is modified when KATP channel openers, natural and synthetic, bind to SUR. We also studied the effects of mutations of neighboring amino acids, Glu128 and Phe132 (SUR1 numbering), of the second intracellular loop of SUR (supplemental Fig. S1) that have been associated with hyperinsulinism and diabetes, respectively (15Proks P. Arnold A.L. Bruining J. Girard C. Flanagan S.E. Larkin B. Colclough K. Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Ellard S. Hum. Mol.

Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Using the Rho protection assay, we demonstrate that mutations of these residues stabilize different conformations of the SUR-Kir6.2 interface. The experimental conditions were essentially as described previously (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). All of the constructs were derived from mouse Kir6.2 (GenBankTM accession number D50581), hamster SUR1 (GenBankTM accession number L40623), and rat SUR2A (GenBankTM accession number D83598) and subcloned in Xenopus oocyte expression vectors derived from pGEMHE (17Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). The construct TMD0 consisted of residues 2–195 of SUR1 with a FLAG epitope (sequence DYKDDDDK) added at the N-terminal (identical to construct Phe195 in Ref. 7Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced by PCR (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene). For the Kir6.2ΔC36 construct (18Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), a premature stop codon was introduced at the correct position to delete last 36 residues of the C terminus. The coding sequence of each clone was verified by sequencing. After amplification and linearization, plasmid DNAs were transcribed in vitro by using the T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) to produce cRNA for subsequent oocyte microinjection. Female Xenopus laevis were anesthetized with 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester (1 g/liter of water). Part of one ovary was removed with a minilaparotomy, the incision was sutured, and the animal was allowed to recover. Animal handling conformed with French regulations and were approved by local governmental veterinary services (authorization number 38-08-10). Stage V or VI oocytes were defolliculated by a 60-min incubation at 19 °C with 2 mg/ml type A collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich). Selected oocytes were injected the next day with cRNAs encoding wild-type or truncated Kir6.2 (0.2 or 2 ng) and, where applicable, TMD0 (2 ng) or wild-type or modified SURs (6 ng). Injected oocytes were stored at 19 °C in Barth’s solution (1 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 88 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)2, 16 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin. 3–5 days after injection, the oocytes were devitellinized, and recombinant KATP channels were characterized by the patch-clamp technique in the excised inside-out configuration at room temperature (∼22 °C). Patch pipettes contained 154 mm K+, 146 mm Cl−, 5 mm Mg2+, and 10 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.1). The cytoplasmic face of the patch was bathed in solutions that, unless otherwise noted, contained 174 mm K+, 40 mm Cl−, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm Mg2+, 10 mm PIPES-KOH (pH 7.1), and methanesulfonate− as the remaining anions. For experiments in 0 Mg2+, Mg2+ was omitted, and EGTA was replaced by EDTA to chelate residual traces of divalent cations. ATP (potassium salt; Sigma-Aldrich), Zn2+ (chloride salt; Fluka), diazoxide (100 mm stock in Me2SO; Sigma), SR47063 (20 mm stock in Me2SO; Sanofi-Aventis), P1075 (20 mm stock in Me2SO; Leo Pharma), and rhodamine 123 (30 mm stock in ethanol; Sigma-Aldrich) were added as specified. The membrane potential was −50 mV. Applications of the various solutions to the patch were performed using a customized RSC-100 system (Bio-Logic) (19Vivaudou M. Forestier C. J. Physiol. 1995; 486: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Control, acquisition, and analysis were performed with in-house software. Open probability (Po) was determined using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices). Slow fluctuations of the base line were removed by interactive fitting with a spline curve and subtraction of this fit from the signal. To quantify the effects of Rho in 0 ATP, where currents are more prone to rundown, whenever possible, current decline before application was extrapolated manually, and this extrapolated value served as the control current (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, no obvious differences were noticed between the overall results and the observations limited to patches displaying little or no rundown. The results are displayed as the means ± S.E. Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA of Kir6.2ΔC36 or with a mixture of cRNAs coding SUR2A or SUR1 and Kir6.2-expressed exogenous potassium currents inhibited by ATP. In excised inside-out patches, MgADP (300 μm), the main physiological KATP channel opener, inhibited SUR-less Kir6.2ΔC36 currents by ∼40%, but it did not change SUR+Kir6.2 currents. This indicates that at 300 μm, binding of MgADP to SUR elicits an activation that compensates the inhibitory effect on Kir6.2. Application of Rho (10 μm) in the presence of MgADP triggered different effects depending on the expressed channel. Kir6.2ΔC36 was inhibited more than 80% by Rho (Fig. 1, A and F), in the presence or absence of MgADP. The full KATP channel constituted of SUR1 or SUR2A and Kir6.2 were strongly blocked by Rho (∼80%) in control but only weakly in the presence of MgADP (13 ± 4 and 22 ± 5% inhibition for SUR2A and SUR1, respectively; Fig. 1, B, C, and F). These results suggest that, like previously reported for ATP (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), binding of MgADP to SUR induces a conformational change that shields Kir6.2 from the inhibitory action of Rho. To test the role of Mg2+ in the effect of ADP, experiments were conducted in Mg2+-free conditions (Fig. 1, D–F). In ADP, removal of Mg2+ did not affect Rho inhibition of Kir6.2ΔC36 currents (92 ± 2% without Mg2+ versus 81 ± 5% in 1 mm Mg2+). In contrast, protection by ADP of SUR2A+Kir6.2 was considerably reduced in magnesium-free conditions (Rho inhibition of 13 ± 4% in 1 mm Mg2+ and 61 ± 7% without Mg2+). This effect of Mg2+ requires ADP because Mg2+ alone does not protect against Rho block (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Inhibition of SUR2A+Kir6.2 was less in magnesium-free ADP than in the complete absence of nucleotides (61 ± 7% in magnesium-free ADP versus 79.5 ± 1.5% in nucleotide-free control; p < 0.02). Magnesium-free ADP unexpectedly produced a slow increase in SUR2A+Kir6.2 currents, as evidenced by observable increases in maximal currents. Such an effect has been evoked earlier (20Ribalet B. John S.A. Weiss J.N. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 266-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This combination of incomplete Rho block and ADP-enhanced channel activity gave rise to sizable residual currents after Rho application (Fig. 1E). In another set of experiments (supplemental Fig. S2), the two NBDs of SUR2A were disabled by mutating the key Walker B aspartate residues of both NBDs to glutamine (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Prost A.L. Bloc A. Hussy N. Derand R. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The resulting mutant SUR2AD832N,D1469N is no longer activated by MgADP. In MgADP, inhibition by Rho of the mutant SUR2AD832N,D1469N was 85 ± 4% (n = 8), much higher than wild-type SUR2A but comparable with Kir6.2ΔC36. It therefore appears that magnesium-free ADP can confer some protection against Rho block but that MgADP is much more efficient. This effect is likely mediated by interaction with the NBDs of SUR and could be correlated with the capacity of MgADP to activate the KATP channel because both effects are suppressed by the same NBD mutations. Zinc, which is co-secreted with insulin by β-cells, is another physiological opener of the pancreatic KATP channels SUR1+Kir6.2 that acts from both faces of the membrane (21Prost A.L. Bloc A. Hussy N. Derand R. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because nucleotides interfere with Rho inhibition, we performed tests in nucleotide-free conditions. EGTA, normally present at 1 mm in all internal solutions, was also removed to avoid zinc chelation. In those conditions, a saturating concentration of cytoplasmic zinc (32 μm) weakly potentiated SUR1+Kir6.2. Compared with the 69 ± 11% inhibition observed in the absence of zinc, 10 μm Rho in the presence of zinc produced an inhibition of only 21 ± 6% (Fig. 2). Similar experiments were performed with SR47063, a pharmacological opener of cardiac type SUR2A+Kir6.2 channels (22Moreau C. Gally F. Jacquet-Bouix H. Vivaudou M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 67: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). In the absence of nucleotides, a saturating concentration of 100 μm SR47063 had opposite effects on Kir6.2ΔC36 and SUR2A+Kir6.2 currents, inhibiting the former by 45 ± 0.02% and activating the latter by 53 ± 0.2%. In the presence of SR47063, Rho inhibition of Kir6.2ΔC36 remained as high as in control (84 ± 4%), whereas inhibition of SUR2A+Kir6.2 was drastically reduced to 20 ± 3%. These observations suggest that activation by distinct pathways converges toward the same Rho phenotype, which we have shown to reflect a particular conformation of the SUR/Kir6.2 interface. The mutation F132L in TMD0 of SUR1 is responsible for neonatal diabetes (15Proks P. Arnold A.L. Bruining J. Girard C. Flanagan S.E. Larkin B. Colclough K. Hattersley A.T. Ashcroft F.M. Ellard S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1793-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Because it was shown to alter interaction of TMD0 with Kir6.2 (23Proks P. Shimomura K. Craig T.J. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we tested its effect on the SUR1/Kir6.2 interface using the Rho protection assay. The SUR1F132L+Kir6.2 channel is characterized by a reduced sensitivity to block by nucleotides (17 ± 2% of inhibition by 100 μm ATP versus 82 ± 2% for wild type). Strikingly, SUR1F132L currents were largely unaltered by 10 μm Rho, even in the absence of nucleotides where wild-type SUR1 currents were strongly inhibited (Fig. 4). In nucleotide-free conditions, inhibition by 10 μm Rho was 80 ± 2% for the wild type but only 19 ± 6% for the mutant. In 100 μm ATP, inhibition was relieved similarly for wild-type and mutant SUR1 with values of 9 ± 6 and 7 ± 3%, respectively. This particular Rho phenotype is identical to that observed with TMD0+Kir6.2ΔC36 (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5The SUR2A E126A mutation leads to a constitutive Rho-sensitive conformation, similar to that of SUR-less Kir6.2. A and B, currents recorded in inside-out patches co-expressing Kir6.2 and wild-type SUR2A (A) or the E126A mutant (B).

TMD0F132L+Kir6.2ΔC36 was highly sensitive to Rho inhibition much like Kir6.2ΔC36 alone (Fig. 4C). This observation could be explained simply by the fact that TMD0F132L does not associate with Kir6.2ΔC36 and that we are recording the same Kir6.2ΔC36 channels with and without co-expressed TMD0F132L. However, TMD0F132L does associate with Kir6.2ΔC36 as demonstrated by a previous study (23Proks P. Shimomura K. Craig T.J. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that reported evidence—increased surface expression, gating up-regulation, and reduction of ATP inhibition—of its effects on Kir6.2. In the same study, the F132L mutation was shown by co-immunoprecipitation to diminish the interaction between TMD0 and Kir6.2. This reduced interaction would be consistent with the inability of TMD0F132L to protect from Rho block. It remains that, when probed with the Rho protection assay, the F132L mutation had distinct effects on full-length SUR1 and on the isolated TMD0 domain. One should therefore exercise much caution when extrapolating results from part to whole. In particular, it might not be valid to infer the behavior of full-length SUR from results obtained with TMD0 alone (7Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Proks P. Shimomura K. Craig T.J. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the mutation F132L in SUR1 produces a Rho-resistant phenotype like the activators MgADP, zinc, or SR47063. This phenotype resembles that of TMD0 alone and is characterized by a reduced Kir6.2 sensitivity to block by ATP. This suggests that the mutation F132L mimics the presence of openers and causes channel hyperactivity by inducing a conformational change that alters the TMD0/Kir6.2 interface. Residue Phe132 is located in the predicted second intracellular loop of SUR1 (24Raab-Graham K.F. Cirilo L.J. Boettcher A.A. Radeke C.M. Vandenberg C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29122-29129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Another residue of this short loop, Glu128, also causes disease when mutated; mutation E128K is responsible for hyperinsulinism because it reduces KATP channel activity by interfering with proper trafficking of channels to the plasma membrane (16Yan F.F. Lin Y.W. MacMullen C. Ganguly A. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because of the opposite pathological consequences of F132L and E128K mutations despite their proximity, it was interesting to also subject E128K to the Rho protection assay. To circumvent the absence of surface expression of SUR1E128K, we tested first the equivalent E126K mutation and later the less drastic E126A mutation in the cardiac isoform SUR2A. If SUR2AE126K produced few or no excised patch currents (2.1 ± 1.6 pA), SUR2AE126A gave rise to large currents (895 ± 215 pA), although the currents were significantly smaller than wild-type SUR2A (3.6 ± 0.3 nA). The SUR2AE126A channels were less sensitive to ATP inhibition than wild-type SUR2A but more than Kir6.2ΔC36 (IC50 values of 44 ± 2, 15 ± 1, and 101 ± 34 μm, respectively; supplemental Fig. S3). Estimation from single-channel records (supplemental Fig. S4) yielded Po = 0.073 ± 0.02 (n = 7) for SUR2AE126A, significantly lower than for wild type and equivalent to Kir6.2ΔC36 (6Babenko A.P. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41577-41580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 7Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 23Proks P. Shimomura K. Craig T.J. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 25Pratt E.B. Yan F.F. Gay J.W. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7951-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Unlike wild-type SUR2A, the E126A mutant was fully blocked by Rho in the presence or absence of ATP (Fig. 5). In that respect the mutant behaved like SUR-less Kir6.2. Nevertheless, SUR2AE126A+Kir6.2 was activated by the openers SR47063 (Fig. 5E) and P1075 (supplemental Fig. S5), demonstrating that the E126A mutation did not suppress all coupling between SUR2A and Kir6.2. As for the F132L mutation, we attempted to test the effect of the mutation E126A on TMD0 of SUR2A alone but were unable to record sufficient channel activity from oocytes co-expressing TMD0E126A+Kir6.2ΔC36, thus precluding any valid characterization. Because the SUR2AE126A+Kir6.2 channel remained sensitive to openers, we asked whether the opener SR47063 could also protect it from block by Rho. Surprisingly, this was not the case (Fig. 5, E and F), implying that protection by opener and activation by opener follow separate parallel pathways. Similar tests with ADP showed no protection either, although this appeared more logical because ADP did not produce any obvious SUR-mediated activation of E126A mutant channels (Fig. 5D). We previously reported (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that rhodamine 123 is a conformation-dependent KATP channel inhibitor. Rho targets the Kir6.2 subunit because SUR-less Kir6.2 is blocked by Rho. This block was shown to be independent of the degree of opening of Kir6.2, being equally efficient on fully closed and fully open channels. It was also not correlated to intrinsic Po, being equally efficient on low Po Kir6.2 and high Po SUR+Kir6.2 channels in the absence of nucleotides. Although slow in its onset and its reversal, Rho block appears unrelated to rundown and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate because it was not influenced by the presence of MgATP. When co-expressed with TMD0 of SUR, Kir6.2 is no longer affected by Rho, suggesting that Rho binds at the TMD0-Kir6.2 interfacial contact zone and that TMD0 masks the Rho-binding site. When co-expressed with full-length SUR1 or SUR2A, Kir6.2 is blocked by Rho in the absence of nucleotides. In the presence of ATP, it is protected, and we showed that this protection results from ATP binding to SUR and causing TMD0 to move to a position where it masks the Rho-binding site (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Because TMD0 is the key interaction domain of SUR (7Chan K.W. Zhang H. Logothetis D.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3833-3843Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and because the Rho protection assay is a unique tool to observe the dynamics of its interaction with Kir6.2, we have used this assay to examine the mechanisms of action of SUR physiological and pharmacological openers and of two TMD0 mutations that are associated with inverse clinical phenotypes. All of the activators tested protected Kir6.2 from Rho block. Two physiological activators were examined: ADP and zinc. Both are known to act by interacting with SUR. With Mg2+ as a compulsory co-factor, ADP binds to the NBDs and augments channel activity (26Gribble F.M. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. 1997; 504: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 27Shyng S. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 28Zingman L.V. Alekseev A.E. Bienengraeber M. Hodgson D. Karger A.B. Dzeja P.P. Terzic A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 233-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Rho inhibition was drastically reduced in the presence of ADP, and this effect required Mg2+ and intact NBDs, suggesting that activation and protection are both mediated by MgADP binding to NBDs. Because protection by ATP does not require Mg2+ (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), this result suggests that, unlike ATP, ADP needs Mg2+ to interact with NBDs. Zinc can activate KATP channels, with a marked preference for SUR1 over SUR2A, from both extracellular and intracellular sides (21Prost A.L. Bloc A. Hussy N. Derand R. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Intracellularly, where we used it, zinc targets an as yet unidentified region of SUR. As with other compounds, experiments with zinc were conducted in absence of ATP that by itself would impart Rho protection. Effects caused by zinc could therefore not be attributed to an indirect action resulting from association of this divalent cation with anionic nucleotides. On the other hand, in absence of nucleotides, there is no electrophysiological evidence of zinc binding to SUR because of the lack of any significant effect on SUR1+Kir6.2 channel activity. Nonetheless, zinc did bind to SUR1 because it clearly protected the channels from Rho block. This demonstrates that the Rho protection assay can detect conformational changes in the absence of visible changes in gating. It furthers confirms that Rho protection is independent of Kir6.2 channel activity (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We also tested the pharmacological opener SR47063, an analogue of cromakalim. SR47063 is a prototypical opener of SUR2-based channels that targets the transmembrane regions of SUR2A (29Moreau C. Jacquet H. Prost A.L. D'hahan N. Vivaudou M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6644-6651Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SR4703 strongly protected SUR2A+Kir6.2 channels from Rho block. Rho protection being linked to the conformation of the TMD0-Kir6.2 interface, we can conclude that MgADP, zinc, and SR47063 induce a change of that interface. Because the site of action of zinc is not yet known, this change could be the consequence of direct binding of zinc to TMD0. In contrast, MgADP and SR47063 do not directly interact with TMD0. Their binding, to the NBDs and TMD2 domains, respectively, must therefore induce a global conformational change that is allosterically transmitted to TMD0 and alter the configuration of the interface to mask the Rho inhibitory site. Mutations F132L and E128K in short intracellular loop 2 located in TMD0 of SUR1 have opposite consequences. The neonatal diabetes F132L mutation reduces ATP sensitivity by augmenting open probability (23Proks P. Shimomura K. Craig T.J. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The resulting channel hyperactivity explains the insufficient secretion of insulin by β-cells. The hyperinsulinism E128K mutation disrupts channel trafficking and reduces channel function through poor surface expression (16Yan F.F. Lin Y.W. MacMullen C. Ganguly A. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After rescue to the cell surface by a chemical chaperone, the E128K mutant channels are hyperactive with a lower than normal ATP sensitivity like the F132L mutants, although they exhibit an abnormally low Po (25Pratt E.B. Yan F.F. Gay J.W. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7951-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The F132L and E128K mutations cause therefore an abnormally high activity through different mechanisms. Pratt et al. (25Pratt E.B. Yan F.F. Gay J.W. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7951-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) speculated that E128K caused functional uncoupling between SUR1 and Kir6.2, thus removing the hypersensitization to ATP brought about by SUR1 (18Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Based on co-immunoprecipitation of TMD0 alone and Kir6.2 showing that F132L impaired the association of TMD0 and Kir6.2, Proks et al. (23Proks P. Shimomura K. Craig T.J. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) assumed that TMD0 and SUR behaved identically and concluded that this mutation disconnects SUR from Kir6.2. In that case, one would expect a severe trafficking defect because Kir6.2 needs SUR as a chaperone to cross quality control checkpoints (30Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), but surface expression was normal in Xenopus oocytes (23Proks P. Shimomura K. Craig T.J. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and only moderately reduced in mammalian cells (25Pratt E.B. Yan F.F. Gay J.W. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7951-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Such inconsistency is resolved by Rho protection data showing that the mutation does not have the same effects on TMD0 alone (no Rho protection by TMD0F132L consistent with a loose association with Kir6.2) and on full-length SUR (complete Rho protection by SUR1F132L indicative of a tight association with Kir6.2) and that it is not warranted to extrapolate data from one to the other. Because the SUR1E128K mutant is not present at the surface membrane (16Yan F.F. Lin Y.W. MacMullen C. Ganguly A. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2339-2348Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we introduced the equivalent mutation (E126K) in the SUR2A isoform, which tends to express approximately twice better in our hands. Unfortunately, the surface expression of the SUR2AE126K mutant was too weak for electrophysiological characterization. Mutation to a neutral residue, E126A, was found to yield sufficient currents for our tests. Very recently, Pratt et al. (25Pratt E.B. Yan F.F. Gay J.W. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7951-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) were able to record SUR1E128K channels by boosting surface expression with sulfonylurea pretreatment of transfected mammalian cells. SUR1E128K was less sensitive to ATP inhibition than the wild type, had a lower Po, and remained sensitive to activation by MgADP. The same features applied also to SUR2AE126A. When probed with Rho, SUR1F132L and SUR2AE126A showed opposite phenotypes. The wild-type channels are blocked by Rho in absence of nucleotides and are only weakly affected in the presence of ATP, which confers protection by binding to SUR (14Hosy E. Dérand R. Revilloud J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2007; 582: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). SUR1F132L channels were insensitive to Rho block in all conditions, even in the absence of nucleotides, whereas SUR2AE126A channels were sensitive even when ATP was present. Therefore, SUR1F132L + Kir6.2 channels responded to Rho like channels formed by TMD0 alone with Kir6.2 and SUR2AE126A + Kir6.2 responded like Kir6.2 alone. However, SUR ligands were still capable of modulating Kir6.2; both ADP and diazoxide still activated SUR1F132L channels (supplemental Fig. S6). SR47063 and the pinacidil analogue P1075 still activated SUR2AE126A (supplemental Fig. S5). This suggests that although the F132L and E126A mutations lock the TMD0-Kir6.2 interface in distinct conformations where the Rho-binding site is either always masked or always accessible, other regions of SUR are unaffected and can interact with Kir6.2 to modulate its gating. This favors the notion that multiple physical links exist between SUR and Kir6.2 and that each can serve distinct functions, consistent with the postulated implication in coupling of the acidic region linking NBD1 and TMD2 (31Karger A.B. Park S. Reyes S. Bienengraeber M. Dyer R.B. Terzic A. Alekseev A.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 2008; 131: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and with our recent finding of the role of a C-terminal region of SUR in SUR-mediated activation of Kir6.2 (9Dupuis J.P. Revilloud J. Moreau C.J. Vivaudou M. J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 3075-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Even though the F132L and E128K mutations in SUR1 both tend to reduce channel sensitivity to ATP, their mechanisms of action obviously differ because F132L increases Po, and E128K decreases Po. Nonetheless, after detailed investigation, Proks et al. (23Proks P. Shimomura K. Craig T.J. Girard C.A. Ashcroft F.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16: 2011-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) working on F132L and Pratt et al. (25Pratt E.B. Yan F.F. Gay J.W. Stanley C.A. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 7951-7959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) working on E128K reached identical conclusions: the mutation disrupts the coupling/interaction between TMD0 and Kir6.2. The additional insight obtained by the Rho protection assay appears to resolve this discrepancy as it strengthens the proposed mechanism for E128K while questioning that for F132L. As a surrogate for the low expressing SUR1E128K, we use the mutation E126A in SUR2A. The profiles of SUR1E128K and SUR2AE126A were qualitatively similar with a reduced surface expression, a low Po and a low ATP sensitivity. Results from the Rho protection assay are summarized in Fig. 6. The Rho-sensitive profile of SUR2AE126A is identical to that of SUR-less Kir6.2, suggesting that E126A functionally uncouples TMD0 and Kir6.2. The Rho-protected profile of SUR1F132L is the same as that of TMD0 alone. It also matches the profile induced by physiological and pharmacological openers. This suggests that the conformation of TMD0 in all these cases: F132L, TMD0 alone, and activators, could be similar. Thus, the channel hyperactivity caused by the F132L mutation would reflect the stabilization of TMD0 in the same activated conformation that is triggered by activators. One could speculate that compounds that induce structural changes opposite to that caused by the mutations might be able to correct or attenuate the functional consequences of these mutations. The Rho protection assay could serve to identify such compounds. We are grateful to Dr. J. Bryan (Houston, TX) for hamster SUR1, Dr. S. Seino (Chiba, Japan) for mouse Kir6.2 and rat SUR2A, Dr. K.
