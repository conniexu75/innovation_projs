https://openalex.org/W1993355130,"Analysis of the genomes of four patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and validation in more than 300 patients, has identified four genes — NOTCH1, MYD88, XPO1 and KLHL6 — that are recurrently mutated in the condition. Mutations in NOTCH1, MYD88 and XPO1 are thought to contribute to the clinical evolution of the disease. Evidence that NOTCH1 and MYD88 mutations are activating events highlights them as potential therapeutic targets. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), the most frequent leukaemia in adults in Western countries, is a heterogeneous disease with variable clinical presentation and evolution1,2. Two major molecular subtypes can be distinguished, characterized respectively by a high or low number of somatic hypermutations in the variable region of immunoglobulin genes3,4. The molecular changes leading to the pathogenesis of the disease are still poorly understood. Here we performed whole-genome sequencing of four cases of CLL and identified 46 somatic mutations that potentially affect gene function. Further analysis of these mutations in 363 patients with CLL identified four genes that are recurrently mutated: notch 1 (NOTCH1), exportin 1 (XPO1), myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88) and kelch-like 6 (KLHL6). Mutations in MYD88 and KLHL6 are predominant in cases of CLL with mutated immunoglobulin genes, whereas NOTCH1 and XPO1 mutations are mainly detected in patients with unmutated immunoglobulins. The patterns of somatic mutation, supported by functional and clinical analyses, strongly indicate that the recurrent NOTCH1, MYD88 and XPO1 mutations are oncogenic changes that contribute to the clinical evolution of the disease. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive analysis of CLL combining whole-genome sequencing with clinical characteristics and clinical outcomes. It highlights the usefulness of this approach for the identification of clinically relevant mutations in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2141337702,"Transcription of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) within gene regulatory elements can modulate gene activity in response to external stimuli, but the scope and functions of such activity are not known. Here we use an ultrahigh-density array that tiles the promoters of 56 cell-cycle genes to interrogate 108 samples representing diverse perturbations. We identify 216 transcribed regions that encode putative lncRNAs, many with RT-PCR-validated periodic expression during the cell cycle, show altered expression in human cancers and are regulated in expression by specific oncogenic stimuli, stem cell differentiation or DNA damage. DNA damage induces five lncRNAs from the CDKN1A promoter, and one such lncRNA, named PANDA, is induced in a p53-dependent manner. PANDA interacts with the transcription factor NF-YA to limit expression of pro-apoptotic genes; PANDA depletion markedly sensitized human fibroblasts to apoptosis by doxorubicin. These findings suggest potentially widespread roles for promoter lncRNAs in cell-growth control."
https://openalex.org/W2079958881,"Jupiter and Saturn formed in a few million years (Haisch et al. 2001) from a gas-dominated protoplanetary disk, and were susceptible to gas-driven migration of their orbits on timescales of only ~100,000 years (Armitage 2007). Hydrodynamic simulations show that these giant planets can undergo a two-stage, inward-then-outward, migration (Masset & Snellgrove 2001, Morbidelli & Crida 2007, Pierens & Nelson 2008). The terrestrial planets finished accreting much later (Klein et al. 2009), and their characteristics, including Mars' small mass, are best reproduced by starting from a planetesimal disk with an outer edge at about one astronomical unit from the Sun (Wetherill 1978, Hansen 2009) (1 AU is the Earth-Sun distance). Here we report simulations of the early Solar System that show how the inward migration of Jupiter to 1.5 AU, and its subsequent outward migration, lead to a planetesimal disk truncated at 1 AU; the terrestrial planets then form from this disk over the next 30-50 million years, with an Earth/Mars mass ratio consistent with observations. Scattering by Jupiter initially empties but then repopulates the asteroid belt, with inner-belt bodies originating between 1 and 3 AU and outer-belt bodies originating between and beyond the giant planets. This explains the significant compositional differences across the asteroid belt. The key aspect missing from previous models of terrestrial planet formation is the substantial radial migration of the giant planets, which suggests that their behaviour is more similar to that inferred for extrasolar planets than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2007265317,"Malignant pleural mesotheliomas (MPMs) often show CDKN2A and NF2 inactivation, but other highly recurrent mutations have not been described. To identify additional driver genes, we used an integrated genomic analysis of 53 MPM tumor samples to guide a focused sequencing effort that uncovered somatic inactivating mutations in BAP1 in 23% of MPMs. The BAP1 nuclear deubiquitinase is known to target histones (together with ASXL1 as a Polycomb repressor subunit) and the HCF1 transcriptional co-factor, and we show that BAP1 knockdown in MPM cell lines affects E2F and Polycomb target genes. These findings implicate transcriptional deregulation in the pathogenesis of MPM."
https://openalex.org/W2117215414,"Orientation judgments are more accurate at the horizontal and vertical orientations, possibly reflecting a statistical inference. Here the authors provide evidence for this idea, finding that observers' internal models for orientation match the local orientation distribution measured in photographs, and suggest how such information could be encoded in a neural population. Humans are good at performing visual tasks, but experimental measurements have revealed substantial biases in the perception of basic visual attributes. An appealing hypothesis is that these biases arise through a process of statistical inference, in which information from noisy measurements is fused with a probabilistic model of the environment. However, such inference is optimal only if the observer's internal model matches the environment. We found this to be the case. We measured performance in an orientation-estimation task and found that orientation judgments were more accurate at cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations. Judgments made under conditions of uncertainty were strongly biased toward cardinal orientations. We estimated observers' internal models for orientation and found that they matched the local orientation distribution measured in photographs. In addition, we determined how a neural population could embed probabilistic information responsible for such biases."
https://openalex.org/W2128366752,"Deciding when to leave a depleting resource to exploit another is a fundamental problem for all decision makers. The neuronal mechanisms mediating patch-leaving decisions remain unknown. We found that neurons in primate (Macaca mulatta) dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, an area that is linked to reward monitoring and executive control, encode a decision variable signaling the relative value of leaving a depleting resource for a new one. Neurons fired during each sequential decision to stay in a patch and, for each travel time, these responses reached a fixed threshold for patch-leaving. Longer travel times reduced the gain of neural responses for choosing to stay in a patch and increased the firing rate threshold mandating patch-leaving. These modulations more closely matched behavioral decisions than any single task variable. These findings portend an understanding of the neural basis of foraging decisions and endorse the unification of theoretical and experimental work in ecology and neuroscience."

https://openalex.org/W2034167623,"Autophagy is an important mechanism of innate immune defense. We have recently shown that autophagy components are recruited with septins, a new and increasingly characterized cytoskeleton component, to intracytosolic Shigella that have started to polymerize actin. On the other hand, intracytosolic Listeria avoids autophagy recognition by expressing ActA, a bacterial effector required for actin polymerization. Here, we exploit Shigella and Listeria as intracytosolic tools to characterize different pathways of selective autophagy. We show that the ubiquitin-binding adaptor proteins p62 and NDP52 target Shigella to an autophagy pathway dependent upon septin and actin. In contrast, p62 or NDP52 targets the Listeria ActA mutant to an autophagy pathway independent of septin or actin. TNF-α, a host cytokine produced upon bacterial infection, stimulates p62-mediated autophagic activity and restricts the survival of Shigella and the Listeria ActA mutant.

These data provide a new molecular framework to understand the emerging complexity of autophagy and its ability to achieve specific clearance of intracytosolic bacteria. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic pathway that allows eukaryotes to degrade and recycle intracellular components by sequestering proteins and organelles in specialized double-membrane vesicles named autophagosomes (1Yang Z. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 2Levine B. Kroemer G.

Although autophagosomes can sequester cytosolic material nonspecifically, e.g. as a response to starvation, there is increasing evidence for selective autophagic degradation of various cellular structures, including protein aggregates, mitochondria, and microbes (4Kraft C. Peter M. Hofmann K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 5Johansen T. Lamark T. Autophagy. 2011; 7: 279-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). The mechanism of selective autophagy is not well understood, yet the role of ubiquitin in this process is critical (5Johansen T. Lamark T. Autophagy. 2011; 7: 279-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 6Kirkin V. McEwan D.G. Novak I. Dikic I. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 259-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). By simultaneous binding to both ubiquitin and the autophagosome-associated ubiquitin-like proteins (i.e. LC3/GABARAP proteins) autophagy receptors can mediate docking of ubiquitinated cargo to the autophagosome, thereby ensuring their selective degradation (5Johansen T. Lamark T. Autophagy. 2011; 7: 279-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 6Kirkin V. McEwan D.G. Novak I. Dikic I. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 259-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Of the ubiquitin-binding proteins in selective autophagy, p62 (sequestosome 1; SQSTM1) has emerged as the prototype autophagy receptor (7Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H.

Recent evidence has implicated the cytoskeleton as a critical mediator of selective autophagy. We have shown that septins, a novel component of the cytoskeleton (10Weirich C.S. Erzberger J.P. Barral Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 478-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), are recruited with autophagy proteins to “cage” Shigella flexneri in the cytosol of infected cells and restrict bacterial dissemination (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N. Mallet A. Lelek M. Gouin E. Demangel C. Brosch R. Zimmer C. Sartori A. Kinoshita M. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These results suggest an interdependence between the two evolutionarily conserved processes of septin assembly and autophagy: when septins are absent, autophagy markers accumulate less, and vice versa. However, in the case of Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterial pathogen that also escapes to the cytosol, no efficient septin caging has been observed (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N. Mallet A. Lelek M. Gouin E. Demangel C. Brosch R. Zimmer C. Sartori A. Kinoshita M. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Listeria has been reported to avoid autophagic recognition by expressing ActA, a bacterial effector required for actin tail motility (12Yoshikawa Y. Ogawa M. Hain T. Yoshida M. Fukumatsu M. Kim M. Mimuro H. Nakagawa I. Yanagawa T. Ishii T. Kakizuka A. Sztul E. Chakraborty T. Sasakawa C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 13Ogawa M. Yoshikawa Y. Mimuro H. Hain T. Chakraborty T. Sasakawa C. Autophagy. 2011; 7: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore Listeria evades both septin caging and autophagy via its surface expression of ActA (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N. Mallet A. Lelek M. Gouin E. Demangel C. Brosch R. Zimmer C.

Given these fundamental differences between Shigella and Listeria, it is clear that in-depth investigation of these two bacteria will help to describe precisely the coordination among actin, septin, and selective autophagy. The role of p62 and/or NDP52 in selective autophagy of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium) has recently been characterized (9Thurston T.L. Ryzhakov G. Bloor S. von Muhlinen N. Randow F. Nat. Immunol. 2009; 10: 1215-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 14Zheng Y.T. Shahnazari S. Brech A. Lamark T. Johansen T. Brumell J.H. J.

It has been proposed that p62 and NDP52 act independently to drive efficient bacterial autophagy of S. typhimurium within Salmonella-containing vacuoles (15Cemma M. Kim P.K. Brumell J.H. Autophagy. 2011; 7: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To assess the role of p62 and NDP52 in the autophagy of bacterial pathogens that escape to the cytosol and to determine the role of the actin/septin cytoskeleton in this process, we examined these components in the case of Shigella and Listeria and reveal that these different intracytosolic bacteria are targeted to different pathways of selective autophagy. L. monocytogenes EGD (BUG 600) and EGDΔactA (BUG 2140) were grown overnight at 37 °C in brain heart infusion medium (Difco Laboratories), diluted 15 × in fresh brain heart infusion medium, and cultured until A600 nm = 0.8. S. flexneri M90T (BUG 2505), M90TΔicsA (BUG 1791), and M90TΔicsB were cultured overnight in trypticase soy, diluted 80 × in fresh trypticase soy, and cultured until A600 nm = 0.6.

The anti-NBR1 (Abnova, H00004077-A01) used was a mouse polyclonal antibody. Mouse monoclonal antibodies used were anti-GAPDH (AbCam, 6C5), FK2 (Enzo Life Sciences, PW8810), FK1 (Enzo Life Sciences, PW8805), and anti-p62 lck ligand (BD Biosciences, 610832). Secondary antibodies used were Cy5- (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), Alexa Fluor 488-, or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse (Molecular Probes). F-actin was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488-, 546-, or 647-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). For immunoblotting, total cellular extracts were blotted with the above-mentioned antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Biosys Laboratories). GAPDH was used throughout as a loading control. Proteins were run on 8, 10, or 14% acrylamide gels. 1–1.5 × 105 HeLa cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well plates (Techno Plastic Products) and used for experiments 48 h later. Cells on coverslips were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde and then washed with 1× PBS and processed for immunofluorescence (IF). After 10 min of incubation in 50 mm ammonium chloride, cells were permeabilized for 4 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated in 1× PBS. Incubation with primary or secondary antibodies was performed in 1× PBS. Vectashield hard set mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories) or mounting medium for IF (Interchim) was used. Listeria was added to host cells at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Bacteria and cells were centrifuged at 1000× g for 1 min at 21 °C and, then incubated at 37 °C and 10% CO2 for 1 h, washed with minimum essential medium, and incubated with fresh gentamicin-containing complete medium (10 μg/ml) for an additional 2 h, after which they were washed with 1× PBS and fixed and processed for IF. Shigella was added to cells at an multiplicity of infection of 100 (for quantification analyses), or 400 μl of growth (A600 nm = 0.6) was diluted in minimum essential medium and added directly to cells (for imaging analyses). Bacteria and cells were centrifuged at 700× g for 10 min at 21 °C and then placed at 37 °C and 10% CO2 for 30 min, washed with minimum essential medium, and incubated with fresh gentamicin-containing complete medium (50 μg/ml) for 4 h, after which they were washed with 1× PBS and fixed and processed for IF. For infection of cells with M. marinum, 2 × 105 RAW macrophages or mouse embryonic fibroblasts were plated onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates and used for experiments 48 h later. M. marinum was washed twice in 1× PBS and passaged through a 26-gauge needle. Bacteria were added to cells in medium without FCS at an multiplicity of infection of 10 (RAW) or 100 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts). Bacteria and cells were centrifuged at 700× g for 5 min at 21 °C and then placed for 2 h at 32 °C and 5% CO2. Infected cells were then washed with 1× PBS and incubated with 200 μg/ml amikacin for 2 h at 32 °C and 5% CO2. After this time, macrophages were washed with 1× PBS and incubated in complete medium at 32 °C and 5% CO2 for 20 or 44 h. After a total of 24 or 48 h, infected cells were washed with 1× PBS and fixed and processed for IF. Images were acquired on a fluorescence inverted microscope Axiovert 200 M (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.) equipped with a cooled digital charge-coupled device camera (Cool SNAPHQ, Photometrics) driven by Metamorph Imaging System software (Universal Imaging Corp). For three-dimensional representation, quantitative microscopy (i.e. counting autophagy receptor recruitment) was performed using Z-stack image series of infected cells, counting 250–1000 bacteria/experiment. Images were processed using ImageJ. Where mentioned, IF microscopy was performed with SEPT2-YFP (BUG 2444), SEPT6-GFP (BUG 2445), SEPT9-CFP (BUG 2309), SEPT9-tdTomato (BUG 2723), or GFP-LC3 (BUG 3046) (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M.

For experiments involving pharmacological inhibitors, HeLa cells were infected and treated for 30 min prior to fixation with dimethyl sulfoxide or cytochalasin D (5 μm). Cytochalasin D was suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide and handled as suggested by the manufacturer (Sigma). To monitor autophagic flux, cells were treated with bafilomycin A1 (Sigma, B1793) for 12 h (160 nm). For experiments involving TNF-α (R&D Systems, 210-TA), cells were treated with 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 12, 20, or 24 h. Treatment was continued throughout infection.

Cells were washed and then lysed with distilled H2O. The number of viable bacteria released from the cells was assessed by plating on Luria Bertani (LB) or brain heart infusion agar plates. Gene expression for p62-GFP cells was induced (i.e. “On”) by adding 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Sigma, T7660) to the culture medium for 24 h (16Larsen K.B. Lamark T. Øvervatn A. Harneshaug I. Johansen T.

After these times, treated p62-GFP cells were washed in 1× PBS, detached with 0.05% EDTA-trypsin, and permeabilized/fixed using BD Cytofix/Cytoperm Fixation/Permeabilization kit (BD Biosciences, 554714). Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were excluded on the basis of forward and side scatter, and a minimum of 10,000 events were acquired per sample. Results were analyzed using FlowJo software. HeLa cells (uninfected) treated or not with bafilomycin, or HeLa cells infected with Shigella or the Listeria ActA mutant in the absence and presence of TNF-α, were lysed in Igepal buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and protease inhibitors mixture). p62, NDP52, SEPT2, or SEPT9 was immunoprecipitated from 800 μg of the total protein extracts by the addition of 1 μg of anti-p62, anti-NDP52, anti-SEPT2, or anti-SEPT9 antibody and 40 μl of a 50% slurry suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-p62, anti-NDP52, anti-SEPT2, or anti-SEPT9 antibody. HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were subsequently used. Protein input was evaluated by probing blots of cell lysates prior to the immunoprecipitation step using antibodies specific to p62, NDP52, SEPT2, or SEPT9. Cells were treated with TNF-α, IL-1β, or IFN-γ for 0, 12, or 24 h. After this time RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini-kit (Qiagen) and converted to cDNA using the High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA mastermix (Applied Biosystems 4375575). Gene expression probes (Applied Biosystems) included GUS (4326320E), p62 (Hs00177654_m1), and NDP52 (Hs00414663_m1). Gene expression was evaluated using the ddCt method, and levels of p62 and NDP52 were normalized to GUS.

We thus addressed the recruitment of NDP52 to Shigella. We first observed the co-localization of NDP52 with ubiquitinated proteins around Shigella (Fig. 1A) and showed that 84 ± 3% of Shigella-septin cages recruited NDP52 (means ± S.E. from n = 3 experiments) (Fig. 1B). To determine whether NDP52 recruitment is dependent upon septins, we used siRNA to deplete cells of SEPT2 or SEPT9 and evaluated NDP52 recruitment to Shigella in these siRNA-treated cells. In both cases, NDP52 recruitment was significantly reduced (3.8 ± 0.4-fold or 3.0 ± 0.6-fold, respectively) (Fig. 1C), concordant with the view that septins play a role in the recruitment of autophagic markers (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N. Mallet A. Lelek M. Gouin E. Demangel C. Brosch R. Zimmer C. Sartori A. Kinoshita M. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; 8: 433-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). We then asked whether p62 and NDP52 were recruited to the same Shigella-septin cage. Indeed, 83 ± 2% of Shigella-septin cages recruited both p62 and NDP52 (mean ± S.E. from n = 3 experiments) (Fig. 1D). To determine whether p62 and NDP52 have independent roles at the Shigella-septin cage, we used siRNA to deplete cells of p62 or NDP52 and evaluated adaptor recruitment to Shigella in these siRNA-treated cells. Strikingly, p62 or NDP52 recruitment was significantly reduced in either case (31.1 ± 5.1-fold or 2.4 ± 0.3-fold in p62-depleted cells, respectively, or 6.6 ± 2.3-fold or 32.6 ± 14.6-fold in NDP52-depleted cells, respectively) (Fig. 1E). These results strongly suggest an interdependent relationship between p62 and NDP52 to target Shigella toward autophagy. p62 is constantly degraded by autophagy and has thus been established as a marker for autophagic activity, i.e. autophagic flux (8Mizushima N. Yoshimori T. Levine B. Cell. 2010; 140: 313-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3532) Google Scholar). To address the role of NDP52 in autophagic activity, we examined the steady-state levels of p62 in the absence and presence of bafilomycin (an inhibitor of autophagosome-lysosome fusion) in control cells or in cells depleted of NDP52. Levels of p62 were significantly reduced in cells depleted for NDP52 in the absence (2.1 ± 0.4-fold) and presence (1.5 ± 0.1-fold) of bafilomycin (Fig. 2), suggesting that p62 and NDP52 are interdependent to promote autophagy. We next examined steady-state levels of NDP52. Levels of NDP52 accumulated in control cells treated with bafilomycin (3.9 ± 0.5-fold), indicating that NDP52, like p62, can be used as a marker of autophagic vesicle turnover (Fig. 2). In cells depleted for p62, levels of NDP52 were significantly reduced in the absence (1.5 ± 0.1-fold) and presence (1.2 ± 0.1-fold) of bafilomycin (Fig. 2). Thus, p62 can significantly regulate NDP52 activity and vice versa. Different pathogens have evolved different ways to escape autophagy (20Mostowy S. Cossart P. Locht C. Simonet M. Bacterial Pathogenesis. Horizon Scientific Press, Rowan House, Hethersett, Norwich, U.K2012: 241-258Google Scholar). In the case of L. monocytogenes, these bacteria avoid ubiquitination, p62 recognition, and septin caging by expressing the surface protein ActA, a bacterial effector required to polymerize actin (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N. Mallet A. Lelek M. Gouin E. Demangel C. Brosch R. Zimmer C. Sartori A. Kinoshita M. Lecuit M. Cossart P.

We addressed the role of NDP52 and showed that L. monocytogenes EGDΔactA, but not the wild-type strain EGD, is recognized by ubiquitin, p62, and NDP52 (Fig. 3A). 95 ± 2% of EGDΔactA recruiting p62 also recruited NDP52 (mean ± S.E. from n = 3 experiments), showing that p62 and NDP52 were recruited to the same bacteria (Fig. 3B). We used siRNA to deplete cells of p62, NDP52, SEPT2, or SEPT9 and evaluated adaptor recruitment to EGDΔactA in these siRNA-treated cells. Unlike what was observed for Shigella (Fig. 1E), NDP52 was recruited to bacteria in p62-depleted cells and vice versa (Fig. 3C). Septin depletion did not affect autophagy receptor recruitment to EGDΔactA (Fig. 3C), in agreement with our previous work showing no septin caging of these bacteria (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N. Mallet A. Lelek M. Gouin E. Demangel C. Brosch R. Zimmer C. Sartori A. Kinoshita M. Lecuit M. Cossart P.

These data reveal that p62 and NDP52 can be recruited independently of each other, and independently of septins, during autophagy of Listeria. As an interdependence between p62 and NDP52 was clearly identified in cells infected with Shigella (Fig. 1E), we analyzed more precisely the signals that recruit p62 and NDP52. Shigella avoids autophagy via the bacterial effector protein IcsB which prevents the binding of Atg5, a protein critical for autophagosome maturation (21Mizushima N. Sugita H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33889-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), to IcsA (22Ogawa M. Yoshimori T. Suzuki T. Sagara H. Mizushima N. Sasakawa C. Science. 2005; 307: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). We thus addressed the role of IcsA and IcsB in the recruitment of p62 and NDP52. S. flexneri M90TΔicsA, i.e. an isogenic mutant strain unable to polymerize actin or recruit septin cages in the cytosol of cells (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N. Mallet A. Lelek M.

In agreement with this result, the inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D significantly reduced the recruitment of ubiquitin, p62, and NDP52 to wild-type bacteria (3.1 ± 0.5-fold, 2.3 ± 0.6-fold, and 2.2 ± 0.5-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4A). Moreover, SEPT2 or SEPT9 depletion similarly reduced the recruitment of ubiquitin (data not shown), p62 (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N. Mallet A. Lelek M. Gouin E. Demangel C. Brosch R.

Therefore, accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and the targeting of Shigella to autophagy by p62 and NDP52 are dependent on actin and septin. It has been shown previously that the IcsB mutant is more efficiently targeted to autophagy (22Ogawa M. Yoshimori T. Suzuki T. Sagara H. Mizushima N. Sasakawa C.

Interestingly, S. flexneri M90TΔicsB recruited significantly more ubiquitin, p62, and NDP52 than did wild-type bacteria (1.8 ± 0.1-fold, 1.9 ± 0.2-fold, and 1.9 ± 0.2-fold, respectively) (Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together, these data highlight the role of IcsB in preventing ubiquitin protein recruitment/formation and the recruitment of p62 and NDP52 and confirm the critical role of actin and septin in this process. We next considered host factors that control the recruitment of autophagy receptors during Shigella infection. TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine that orchestrates a wide range of biological functions, including host defense against pathogens (24Locksley R.M. Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar), and is prominently induced upon Shigella infection (25Perdomo O.J. Cavaillon J.M. Huerre M. Ohayon H. Gounon P. Sansonetti P.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). TNF-α is also known to stimulate septin caging (11Mostowy S. Bonazzi M. Hamon M.A. Tham T.N.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the contribution of miRNAs to the pathogenesis of any specific cancer is lacking. Here we show that in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a small set of miRNAs is responsible for the cooperative suppression of several tumor suppressor genes. Cross-comparison of miRNA expression profiles in human T-ALL with the results of an unbiased miRNA library screen allowed us to identify five miRNAs (miR-19b, miR-20a, miR-26a, miR-92 and miR-223) that are capable of promoting T-ALL development in a mouse model and which account for the majority of miRNA expression in human T-ALL. Moreover, these miRNAs produce overlapping and cooperative effects on tumor suppressor genes implicated in the pathogenesis of T-ALL, including IKAROS (also known as IKZF1), PTEN, BIM, PHF6, NF1 and FBXW7. Thus, a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of miRNA action in T-ALL reveals a striking pattern of miRNA-tumor suppressor gene interactions in this cancer."

They used this set-up to make micron-scale simultaneous measurements of partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and blood flow in the rat olfactory bulb vasculature and neuropil. Uncovering principles that regulate energy metabolism in the brain requires mapping of partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) and blood flow with high spatial and temporal resolution. Using two-photon phosphorescence lifetime microscopy (2PLM) and the oxygen probe PtP-C343, we show that PO2 can be accurately measured in the brain at depths up to 300 μm with micron-scale resolution. In addition, 2PLM allowed simultaneous measurements of blood flow and of PO2 in capillaries with less than one-second temporal resolution. Using this approach, we detected erythrocyte-associated transients (EATs) in oxygen in the rat olfactory bulb and showed the existence of diffusion-based arterio-venous shunts. Sensory stimulation evoked functional hyperemia, accompanied by an increase in PO2 in capillaries and by a biphasic PO2 response in the neuropil, consisting of an 'initial dip' and a rebound. 2PLM of PO2 opens new avenues for studies of brain metabolism and blood flow regulation."

We show that insulin activates phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) signaling in SF-1 neurons and reduces firing frequency in these cells through activation of K(ATP) channels. These effects were abrogated in mice with insulin receptor deficiency restricted to SF-1 neurons (SF-1(ΔIR) mice). Whereas body weight and glucose homeostasis remained the same in SF-1(ΔIR) mice as in controls under a normal chow diet, they were protected from diet-induced leptin resistance, weight gain, adiposity and impaired glucose tolerance. High-fat feeding activated PI3K signaling in SF-1 neurons of control mice, and this response was attenuated in the VMH of SF-1(ΔIR) mice. Mimicking diet-induced overactivation of PI3K signaling by disruption of the phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase PTEN led to increased body weight and hyperphagia under a normal chow diet. Collectively, our experiments reveal that high-fat diet-induced, insulin-dependent PI3K activation in VMH neurons contributes to obesity development."
https://openalex.org/W2059647625,"Obesity is often associated with hypertension and this can lead to cardiovascular disease. Further, activation of a proinflammatory signaling pathway in the brain is known to contribute to obesity. Dongsheng Cai and his colleagues now show that activation of this same pathway in a certain population of neurons results in elevated blood pressure, but independently of obesity. They also show that inhibiting this activation in these neurons prevents hypertension even in the presence of obesity. Obesity-related hypertension has become an epidemic health problem and a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent research on the pathophysiology of obesity has implicated a role for the hypothalamus in the pathogenesis of this condition1,2,3. However, it remains unknown whether the often-seen coupling of hypertension with obesity can also be explained by hypothalamic dysfunction, despite the emerging appreciation that many forms of hypertension are neurogenic in origin4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Our studies here revealed that acute activation of the proinflammatory protein nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and its upstream activator IκB kinase-β (IKK-β, encoded by Ikbkb) in the mediobasal hypothalamus rapidly elevated blood pressure in mice independently of obesity. This form of hypothalamic inflammation-induced hypertension involved the sympathetic upregulation of hemodynamics and was reversed by sympathetic suppression. Loss-of-function studies further showed that NF-κB inhibition in the mediobasal hypothalamus counteracted obesity-related hypertension in a manner that was dissociable from changes in body weight. In addition, we found that pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons were crucial for the hypertensive effects of the activation of hypothalamic IKK-β and NF-κB, which underlie obesity-related hypertension. In conclusion, obesity-associated activation of IKK-β and NF-κB in the mediobasal hypothalamus—particularly in the hypothalamic POMC neurons—is a primary pathogenic link between obesity and hypertension. Breaking this pathogenic link may represent an avenue for controlling obesity-related hypertension and CVD without requiring obesity control."
https://openalex.org/W2003931218,"The use of N-type voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV2.2) blockers to treat pain is limited by many physiological side effects. Here we report that inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity can be suppressed by inhibiting the binding of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) to CaV2.2 and thereby reducing channel function. A peptide of CRMP-2 fused to the HIV transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein (TAT-CBD3) decreased neuropeptide release from sensory neurons and excitatory synaptic transmission in dorsal horn neurons, reduced meningeal blood flow, reduced nocifensive behavior induced by formalin injection or corneal capsaicin application and reversed neuropathic hypersensitivity produced by an antiretroviral drug. TAT-CBD3 was mildly anxiolytic without affecting memory retrieval, sensorimotor function or depression. At doses tenfold higher than that required to reduce hypersensitivity in vivo, TAT-CBD3 caused a transient episode of tail kinking and body contortion. By preventing CRMP-2-mediated enhancement of CaV2.2 function, TAT-CBD3 alleviated inflammatory and neuropathic hypersensitivity, an approach that may prove useful in managing chronic pain."

We investigated whether two Caenorhabditis elegans α- and β-tubulin isotypes, identified through mutants that lack their cilium distal segments, are delivered to their assembly sites by IFT. Mutations in conserved residues in both tubulins destabilize distal singlet microtubules. One isotype, TBB-4, assembles into microtubules at the tips of the axoneme core and distal segments, where the microtubule tip tracker EB1 is found, and localizes all along the cilium, whereas the other, TBA-5, concentrates in distal singlets. IFT assays, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis and modelling indicate that the continual transport of sub-stoichiometric numbers of these tubulin subunits by the IFT machinery can maintain sensory cilia at their steady-state length."

The authors also show that that UNC119 function is conserved from GPCR trafficking in C. elegans olfactory neuron to transducin trafficking in mammalian photoreceptors. UNC119 is widely expressed among vertebrates and other phyla. We found that UNC119 recognized the acylated N terminus of the rod photoreceptor transducin α (Tα) subunit and Caenorhabditis elegans G proteins ODR-3 and GPA-13. The crystal structure of human UNC119 at 1.95-Å resolution revealed an immunoglobulin-like β-sandwich fold. Pulldowns and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a tight interaction between UNC119 and acylated Gα peptides. The structure of co-crystals of UNC119 with an acylated Tα N-terminal peptide at 2.0 Å revealed that the lipid chain is buried deeply into UNC119′s hydrophobic cavity. UNC119 bound Tα-GTP, inhibiting its GTPase activity, thereby providing a stable UNC119–Tα-GTP complex capable of diffusing from the inner segment back to the outer segment after light-induced translocation. UNC119 deletion in both mouse and C. elegans led to G protein mislocalization. Thus, UNC119 is a Gα subunit cofactor essential for G protein trafficking in sensory cilia."
https://openalex.org/W2027996995,"Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (MFs) are important multifunctional immune cells. Like other cell types, they express hundreds of different microRNAs (miRNAs) that are recently discovered post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Here we present updated miRNA expression profiles of monocytes, DCs and MFs. Compared with monocytes, ∼50 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in immature and mature DCs or MFs, with major expression changes occurring during the differentiation. Knockdown of DICER1, a protein needed for miRNA biosynthesis, led to lower DC-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) and enhanced CD14 protein levels, confirming the importance of miRNAs in DC differentiation in general. Inhibition of the two most highly up-regulated miRNAs, miR-511 and miR-99b, also resulted in reduced DC-SIGN level. Prediction of miRNA-511 targets revealed a number of genes with known immune functions, of which TLR4 and CD80 were validated using inhibition of miR-511 in DCs and luciferase assays in HEK293 cells. Interestingly, under the cell cycle arrest conditions, miR-511 seems to function as a positive regulator of TLR4. In conclusion, we have identified miR-511 as a novel potent modulator of human immune response. In addition, our data highlight that miRNA influence on gene expression is dependent on the cellular environment."
https://openalex.org/W2028251862,"Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal myeloblasts (mainly granulocyte or monocyte precursors) in the bone marrow and blood. Though great progress has been made for improvement in clinical treatment during the past decades, only minority with AML achieve long-term survival. Therefore, further understanding mechanisms of leukemogenesis and exploring novel therapeutic strategies are still crucial for improving disease outcome. MicroRNA-100 (miR-100), a small non-coding RNA molecule, has been reported as a frequent event aberrantly expressed in patients with AML; however, the molecular basis for this phenotype and the statuses of its downstream targets have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we found that the expression level of miR-100 in vivo was related to the stage of the maturation block underlying the subtypes of myeloid leukemia. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that miR-100 was required to promote the cell proliferation of promyelocytic blasts and arrest them differentiated to granulocyte/monocyte lineages. Significantly, we identified RBSP3, a phosphatase-like tumor suppressor, as a bona fide target of miR-100 and validated that RBSP3 was involved in cell differentiation and survival in AML. Moreover, we revealed a new pathway that miR-100 regulates G1/S transition and S-phase entry and blocks the terminal differentiation by targeting RBSP3, which partly in turn modulates the cell cycle effectors pRB/E2F1 in AML. These events promoted cell proliferation and blocked granulocyte/monocyte differentiation. Our data highlight an important role of miR-100 in the molecular etiology of AML, and implicate the potential application of miR-100 in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1990054550,"Wild-type p53 is a stress-responsive tumor suppressor and potent growth inhibitor. Genotoxic stresses (for example, ionizing and ultraviolet radiation or chemotherapeutic drug treatment) can activate p53, but also induce mutations in the P53 gene, and thus select for p53-mutated cells. Nutlin-3a (Nutlin) is pre-clinical drug that activates p53 in a non-genotoxic manner. Nutlin occupies the p53-binding pocket of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), activating p53 by blocking the p53–MDM2 interaction. Because Nutlin neither binds p53 directly nor introduces DNA damage, we hypothesized Nutlin would not induce P53 mutations, and, therefore, not select for p53-mutated cells. To test this, populations of SJSA-1 (p53 wild-type) cancer cells were expanded that survived repeated Nutlin exposures, and individual clones were isolated. Group 1 clones were resistant to Nutlin-induced apoptosis, but still underwent growth arrest. Surprisingly, while some Group 1 clones retained wild-type p53, others acquired a heterozygous p53 mutation. Apoptosis resistance in Group 1 clones was associated with decreased PUMA induction and decreased caspase 3/7 activation. Group 2 clones were resistant to both apoptosis and growth arrest induced by Nutlin. Group 2 clones had acquired mutations in the p53-DNA-binding domain and expressed only mutant p53s that were induced by Nutlin treatment, but were unable to bind the P21 and PUMA gene promoters, and unable to activate transcription. These results demonstrate that non-genotoxic p53 activation (for example, by Nutlin treatment) can lead to the acquisition of somatic mutations in p53 and select for p53-mutated cells. These findings have implications for the potential clinical use of Nutlin and other small molecule MDM2 antagonists."

In the present study we intend to establish whether the generation of reactive oxygen species by CO-RMs may indeed result in the inhibition of bacterial cellular function. We now report that two CO-RMs (CORM-2 and ALF062) stimulate the production of ROS in Escherichia coli, an effect that is abolished by addition of antioxidants. Furthermore, deletion of genes encoding E. coli systems involved in reactive oxygen species scavenging, namely catalases and superoxide dismutases, potentiates the lethality of CORM-2 due to an increase of intracellular ROS content. CORM-2 also induces the expression of the E. coli DNA repair/SOS system recA, and its inactivation enhances toxicity of CORM-2. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy images reveal that CORM-2 causes DNA lesions to bacterial cells. We also demonstrate that cells treated with CORM-2 contain higher levels of free iron arising from destruction of iron-sulfur proteins. Importantly, we show that CO-RMs generate hydroxyl radicals in a cell-free solution, a process that is abolished by scavenging CO.

The endogenous CO production has benefits in the neural, cardiovascular, and renal systems, having a cytoprotective effect in several pathologic conditions such as atherosclerotic vascular disease and inflammation (1Li C. Hossieny P. Wu B.J. Qawasmeh A. Beck K. Stocker R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 2227-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, high concentrations of CO are toxic resulting primarily from the binding of CO to hemoglobin and to cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal electron acceptor of the respiratory chain (2Haldane J.B.

In mice brains it was observed that CO toxicity, associated with the binding of CO to the terminal oxidase, increases the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely hydrogen peroxide, augments the level of oxidized proteins and lipid peroxidation of the plasma, and decreases the ratio reduced/oxidized glutathione. As expected, these effects are counteracted by the presence of superoxide dismutase and iron chelators (4Zhang J. Piantadosi C.A. J. Clin.

One of the three isoforms of mammalian heme oxygenase enzymes, HO-1, is inducible by several stress agents, including heme, heat shock, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and hypoxia. Because these agents share the ability to directly or indirectly generate ROS, the elevated HO-1 expression is considered as a cellular indicator of oxidative stress (3Wu L. Wang R. Pharmacol.

Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HO-1-derived CO has been reported to have remarkable benefits on microbial sepsis, as HO-1-deficient mice display enhanced susceptibility to polymicrobial infections and the administration of exogenous CO rescues the HO-1-deficient mice from sepsis-induced lethality (6Chung S.W. Liu X. Macias A.A. Baron R.M. Perrella M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Exogenous administration of CO, via CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), also shown to be able to kill bacteria (7Nobre L.S. Seixas J.D. Romão C.C. Saraiva L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the physiological consequences of the action of CO-RMs on bacteria addressed by global transcriptional analysis revealed that CO-RMs induce a significant alteration on the bacterial transcriptome. In particular, induction of genes encoding two main redox-sensing regulators that control the bacterial oxidative response, SoxS and OxyR, occurs in cells exposed to CORM-2, and Escherichia coli strains lacking oxyR and soxS genes exhibit enhanced susceptibility to CORM-2, altogether suggesting that CO potentiates the generation of reactive oxygen species (8Nobre L.S. Al-Shahrour F. Dopazo J. Saraiva L.M. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The generation of intracellular ROS causes deterioration of DNA, lipids, and proteins and several targets have been linked to loss of cell integrity and/or viability (9Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. Int. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar). DNA is especially prone to iron-catalyzed oxidation, as iron binds directly to the phosphodiester backbone where OH radicals are subsequently generated (10Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 11Avery S.V. Biochem. J. 2011; 434: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In particular, guanine residues on DNA are targets of oxidation as well as thiol groups and iron-sulfur clusters of proteins (9Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. Int. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brzóska K. Meczyńska S. Kruszewski M. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2006; 53: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Besides loss of function, denaturation of iron-sulfur clusters contributes itself to toxicity because the iron that is released upon oxidation of the clusters provokes additional oxidative damage via the Fenton reaction (11Avery S.V. Biochem. J. 2011; 434: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, bacteria have several mechanisms to avoid this outcome. The typical responses to ROS include DNA repair systems (e.g. RecA), the action of scavenging molecules (e.g. glutathione) and detoxification systems, like superoxide dismutase and catalase (9Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. Int. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, oxidative conditions have been shown to trigger the Isc and Suf systems, which are responsible for the de novo assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in nascent polypeptides (14Ayala-Castro C. Saini A. Outten F.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 110-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar).In the present work we have exposed bacterial cultures to CO-releasing molecules and determined the effect of these compounds on cell viability upon addition of antioxidants, measured the level of ROS, analyzed the deletion of ROS scavenging systems, observed the degree of DNA damage, evaluated the status of iron and iron-sulfur enzymes, and tested the generation of oxygen radicals by the CO-releasing molecules. Altogether, the data revealed that the bactericidal action of CO-releasing molecules relies on the generation of deleterious intracellular oxidative stress conditions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Growth Conditions, and Viability AssaysThe bacterial strains used in this work are described in Table 1. All E. coli cells, grown aerobically in minimal medium salts (7Nobre L.S. Seixas J.D. Romão C.C. Saraiva L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) at 37 °C and 150 rpm, were cultured until reaching an optical density at 600 nm (OD600 nm) of 0.3 at which point the CO-releasing molecules were added. Tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) dimer (CORM-2) from Sigma and tetraethylammonium molybdenum pentacarbonylbromide (ALF062) from Alfama (Oeiras, Portugal) (7Nobre L.S. Seixas J.D. Romão C.C. Saraiva L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) were used as CO donors; these compounds were freshly prepared as 10 mm stock solutions by dissolution in dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol, respectively. Ru(II)Cl2(DMSO)4 from Strem Chemicals (Bischheim, France) was used as the inactive form of CORM-2 (iCORM-2) and the inactivated form of ALF062, named iALF062, was prepared by overnight vigorous mixing of the compound with methanol. When required, together with CO-RMs, reduced hemoglobin (20 μm; Sigma), reduced glutathione (5 mm; Calbiochem, Lisbon, Portugal), glutamate (50 mm; Sigma), cysteine (600 μm; Sigma), and methionine (3 mm; Sigma) were added to the growth culture. To determine the cell viability of E. coli strains, the number of colony forming unit(s) was evaluated in the presence of the compounds and their inactive forms. The percentage of survival was determined as the number of colonies obtained after CO-RMs treatment divided by the number of colonies formed in the cultures treated with the inactive form. Wild type E. coli cells were treated with 250 μm CORM-2 and 50 μm ALF062, whereas for the analysis of the E. coli mutant strains and their parent strains CORM-2 was used at a concentration of 150 μm. The experiments were performed in duplicate with at least two independent cultures. The results are presented as averaged values with error bars representing S.E.TABLE 1E. coli strains used in this studyE. coli strainsDescriptionSource or Ref.K12 MG1655Wild type strainLaboratory stockDSH7Parental strain38Yonezawa Y.

The E. coli mutant strains were treated with 150 μm CORM-2 and iCORM-2 for 1 and 4 h. Cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate buffer (PBS), and resuspended in the same buffer. The probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (Sigma) was then added to cell suspensions, at a final concentration of 10 μm, and fluorescence intensity (FI) was acquired during 2 h using a Varian Eclipse 96-well spectrofluorimeter (wavelength of excitation at 485 nm and emission at 538 nm). To determine the ROS variation, the FI of cultures treated with control compounds were subtracted from those of cells treated with CO-RMs. The FI was normalized in relationship to the A600 nm of each culture. These experiments were done in duplicate with at least two different biological samples.Quantitative Real-time RT-PCRFor real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR experiments, 0.5 μg of E. coli total RNA, from two independent cultures, grown with 250 μm CORM-2 and control compound for 1 h, was used to synthesize cDNA with the First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR from Roche Applied Science. Real-time PCR experiments were performed in a LightCycler Instrument using LightCycler® FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). The amplification reactions were carried out using the previously synthesized cDNA as the initial template, and each reaction mixture contained 0.5 μm specific oligonucleotides (recA_up, 5′-CCTTGCGGCACGTATGATGA-3′ and recA_low, 5′-GGCGCAGCGATTTTGTTCTT-3′), 2 mm MgCl2, and hot-start PCR mixture (Roche Applied Science). The expression ratio of the target gene was determined relatively to a reference gene, the E. coli 16S rRNA, whose transcription remains invariant under the tested conditions. The samples were assayed in triplicate.DNA Damage AssaysFor DNA damage assays, E. coli cultures were exposed for 1 h to 8 mm H2O2 (as control), 250 μm CORM-2 and iCORM-2, and treated and analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions of the hOGG1 FlareTM assay kit (Trevigen, UK). Briefly, cells were centrifuged, washed, and resuspended in PBS to obtain a bacterial concentration of 108 colony forming units/ml. The cells were mixed with low agarose, immersed in a lysis solution for 1 h, and then submitted to electrophoresis for 1 h at 12 V in TAE buffer. The SYBR® Green I dye was used for DNA visualization and the images were acquired with a fluorescence microscope (Leica).Reaction of CORM-2 with Free Thiol GroupsThe reduction of Ellman reagent (DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid); Sigma) by free thiol groups releases 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid, which can be monitored spectrophotometrically at 412 nm (16Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21083) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of CORM-2, iCORM-2, and iodocetamide were mixed with 100 μm glutathione (GSH) in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7). After 1 h at room temperature, 500 μm DTNB was added and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured. Iodocetamide is a irreversible thiol-modifying compound and was used as a positive control. Samples and standard curves were done in duplicate. Control reactions performed in the absence of GSH showed no absorbance.EPR StudiesFree Iron DetectionThe intracellular free iron content was determined by EPR in whole cells of E. coli grown for 1 h with 250 μm CORM-2 and iCORM-2, collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 9 ml of fresh minimal medium salts, and treated with 1 ml of 0.2 m deferoxamine mesylate (Sigma) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed once with ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and resuspended in 0.4 ml of the same buffer supplemented with 10% (v/v) glycerol. Aliquots of 0.3 ml were transferred to EPR tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The EPR spectra were obtained on a Bruker EMX spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments continuous flow helium cryostat and recorded at 9.7 GHz microwave frequency, 20 milliwatt microwave power, modulation of amplitude of 2 millitesla at 95 K. The iron content of each sample was determined by measuring the amplitude of the EPR signal and normalizing it for the total protein concentration, which was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18446) Google Scholar). The results represent the average of five independent cultures.EPR Spin-trap AnalysisThe 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl 5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (BMPO) from Applied Bioanalytical Labs (Bradenton, FL) was used as a spin trap for the detection of reactive oxygen species. This spin trap allows one to distinguish between the superoxide anion and the hydroxyl radical (18Zhao H. Joseph J. Zhang H. Karoui H. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 599-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Experiments were conducted with 5 mm BMPO, 2 mm CORM-2 and iCORM-2, and when required 1 mm hemoglobin. EPR spectra were obtained for samples of ALF062 (199 μm in H2O plus 0.7% methanol) mixed with BMPO (25 mm), which were previously bubbled with oxygen or degassed with nitrogen. Samples were loaded into a quartz flat cell and EPR spectra were recorded, at room temperature, on the Bruker EMX spectrometer and recorded at 9.8 GHz microwave frequency, 2 milliwatt microwave power, and modulation of amplitude of 0.1 millitesla.Enzymatic AssaysE. coli cultures treated for 1 h with 250 μm CORM-2 and iCORM-2 were washed and resuspended in the respective assay buffer before being disrupted in a French press. The aconitase activity was measured, under anaerobic conditions, using the indirect method described by Gardner et al. (19Gardner P.R. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 349: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), which follows the production of NADPH at 340 nm (∈340 nm = 6220 m−1 cm−1). To this end, samples were added to the reaction mixture that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.6 mm MnCl2, 0.2 mm NADP+, and 1 unit of isocitrate dehydrogenase (Sigma). The reaction was initiated with 30 mm sodium citrate. One unit of aconitase activity was defined as 1 μmol of NADPH formed per min at 25 °C. The activity of glutamate synthase was determined by the formation of NADP+, following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (∈340 nm = 6220 m−1 cm−1) (20Meister A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The activity was measured in reaction mixtures containing the lysate samples in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) buffer plus 10 mm glutamine and 0.2 mm NADPH, and initiated by addition of 5 mm α-ketoglutarate. One unit of glutamate synthase activity was defined as 1 nmol of NADPH consumed per min at 25 °C. The glutamate dehydrogenase activity was determined as the above described glutamate synthase activity, using 5 mm ammonium chloride instead of glutamine. Activities were assayed in a Shimadzu UV-1700 and normalized to the total cellular protein lysate content determined by bicinchoninic acid assays (17Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18446) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONRecently, CO-RMs based on transition metal carbonyls, were shown to have bactericidal properties against several pathogens including E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7Nobre L.S. Seixas J.D. Romão C.C. Saraiva L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Desmard M. Davidge K.S. Bouvet O. Morin D. Roux D. Foresti R.

These effects have been attributed to CO release because the compounds lacking CO ligands are no longer bacterial inhibitors. Moreover, DNA microarrays indicate that CO is effectively delivered to intracellular targets causing a plethora of transcriptional modifications as judged by the analysis of the data acquired in cells of E. coli exposed to CO-RMs (8Nobre L.S. Al-Shahrour F. Dopazo J. Saraiva L.M. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Davidge K.S. Sanguinetti G. Yee C.H. Cox A.G. McLeod C.W. Monk C.E. Mann B.E. Motterlini R. Poole R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4516-4524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The present work adds relevant information as it shows that CO-RMs stimulate the in vivo production of ROS and the main cellular antioxidant glutathione confers protection against the killing effect of CO-RMs.Importantly, ROS generation from CORM-2 increases with the concentration of the CO-RM and is abolished once the CO groups are absent or scavenged by hemoglobin, providing a clear indication that CO is required for the formation of reactive oxygen species. Our data also show that E. coli strains mutated in genes that encode ROS detoxifiers, namely in superoxide dismutases (sodAB) and catalases (katEG), exhibited a sharp decreased survival indicating that impairment of ROS detoxification potentiates the effect of CORM-2.Furthermore, CORM-2 was found to activate recA transcription and we observed that the bactericidal effect of CORM-2 is accentuated by knocking out recA, most probably due to the inability of triggering the SOS response. Accordingly, we observed by a fluorimetric assay that cells treated with CORM-2 have a higher content of damaged DNA when compared with cells exposed to the inactive form of the compound. The presence of degraded DNA may be explained by the ROS generated by the bactericide as these species are known to cause DNA lesions (10Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar).The results also revealed that cells treated with CORM-2 have higher levels of free iron, which does not arise from exogenous sources but from the disruption of iron-sulfur containing proteins. One such damaged protein was shown to be aconitase, a member of the dehydratase family of proteins characterized by a solvent-exposed oxygen-labile [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster (32Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19328-19333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which upon exposure to CORM-2 exhibited a significantly lower in vivo activity. Moreover, the iscS mutant showed higher resistance to CORM-2, possibly due to the lower abundance of Fe-S clusters in this mutant and to the activation of the suf operon through positive regulation of the apo-form of IscR (26Schwartz C.J. Djaman O. Imlay J.A. Kiley P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9009-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 33Jang S. Imlay J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 78: 1448-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Hence, the toxicity of CORM-2 is related to the content of denaturated Fe-S clusters.Carbon monoxide is a classical inhibitor of the aerobic respiration and consequently it is a source of ROS, as demonstrated for mitochondria and embryonic kidney cells (34D'Amico G. Lam F. Hagen T. Moncada S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2291-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, our results show that CORM-2 generates hydroxyl radicals per se, and this ability seems not to be restricted to this CO-releasing compound because not only ALF062 but also other transition metal carbonyls, like Na[Mo(CO)3(histidinate)] and Na3[Mo(CO)3(citrate)], are reported to promote hydroxyl radical formation (28Seixas J.D. Development of CO-releasing Molecules for the Treatment of Inflammatory Diseases. Instituto de Tecnología Quimíca e Biológica da Universidade Nova de Lisboa, 2010Google Scholar). More importantly, we proved that the radical formation from CORM-2 is intimately associated with the presence of CO ligands as no radical species were observed when the inactive compound devoid of CO, iCORM-2, was used and upon addition of the hemoglobin, a CO chelator.Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrate that in the presence of CORM-2 thiol groups become unable to react with Ellman reagent, thus suggesting that CORM-2 oxidizes free thiol groups of amino acids, most probably due to its ability to produce ROS in vitro. These results are in agreement with the fact that thiol donors, like cysteine and methionine, are able to cancel the effects of CORM-2 on bacterial growth, which was observed by us in the present work and other authors when using CORM-3 against P. aeruginosa (30Desmard M. Davidge K.S. Bouvet O. Morin D. Roux D. Foresti R. Ricard J.D. Denamur E. Poole R.K. Montravers P. Motterlini R. Boczkowski J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).The work described herein shows that bacterial cells treated with CORM-2 have higher amounts of ROS. The fact that other authors did not observe any increase in H2O2 production in P. aeruginosa cells exposed to CORM-3 may be due to the experimental conditions utilized. Nevertheless, the addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine abolished CORM-3-mediated inhibition of bacterial growth (30Desmard M. Davidge K.S. Bouvet O. Morin D. Roux D. Foresti R. Ricard J.D. Denamur E. Poole R.K. Montravers P. Motterlini R. Boczkowski J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Moreover, they observed that P. aeruginosa cells treated with CORM-3 caused the impairment of the respiratory chain, which usually leads to generation of ROS (30Desmard M. Davidge K.S. Bouvet O. Morin D. Roux D. Foresti R. Ricard J.D. Denamur E. Poole R.K. Montravers P. Motterlini R. Boczkowski J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 1023-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar).Several reports have demonstrated that many antibiotics mediate cell death through hydroxyl radical formation in bacteria and that there exists a relationship between antibiotic susceptibility and production of ROS (35Becerra M.C. Albesa I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 297: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 36Dwyer D.J. Kohanski M.A. Collins J.J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2009; 12: 482-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 37Kohanski M.A. Dwyer D.J. Hayete B. Lawrence C.A. Collins J.J. Cell. 2007; 130: 797-810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). Hence, like other antibiotics, the lethal effect of CO-releasing compounds seems to rely on the production of ROS.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that CO-RMs stimulate, in a non-cellular medium, the formation of hydroxyl radicals in a CO-dependent mode. The radicals that are generated account for the bactericidal properties of CORM-2 by damaging DNA and iron-sulfur proteins; the consequent increase of intracellular free iron promotes ROS via the Fenton reaction and for survival bacteria need to bring into play cellular mechanisms of oxidant protection. Altogether, the herein presented results provide a molecular basis of the CO-RMs antibacterial action.

The endogenous CO production has benefits in the neural, cardiovascular, and renal systems, having a cytoprotective effect in several pathologic conditions such as atherosclerotic vascular disease and inflammation (1Li C. Hossieny P. Wu B.J. Qawasmeh A. Beck K. Stocker R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 2227-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, high concentrations of CO are toxic resulting primarily from the binding of CO to hemoglobin and to cytochrome c oxidase, the terminal electron acceptor of the respiratory chain (2Haldane J.B. Biochem. J. 1927; 21: 1068-1075Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Wu L. Wang R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 585-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). In mice brains it was observed that CO toxicity, associated with the binding of CO to the terminal oxidase, increases the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), namely hydrogen peroxide, augments the level of oxidized proteins and lipid peroxidation of the plasma, and decreases the ratio reduced/oxidized glutathione. As expected, these effects are counteracted by the presence of superoxide dismutase and iron chelators (4Zhang J. Piantadosi C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). One of the three isoforms of mammalian heme oxygenase enzymes, HO-1, is inducible by several stress agents, including heme, heat shock, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and hypoxia. Because these agents share the ability to directly or indirectly generate ROS, the elevated HO-1 expression is considered as a cellular indicator of oxidative stress (3Wu L. Wang R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 585-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 5Ryter S.W. Otterbein L.E. Morse D. Choi A.M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 249-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). On the other hand, HO-1-derived CO has been reported to have remarkable benefits on microbial sepsis, as HO-1-deficient mice display enhanced susceptibility to polymicrobial infections and the administration of exogenous CO rescues the HO-1-deficient mice from sepsis-induced lethality (6Chung S.W. Liu X. Macias A.A. Baron R.M. Perrella M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Exogenous administration of CO, via CO-releasing molecules (CO-RMs), also shown to be able to kill bacteria (7Nobre L.S. Seixas J.D. Romão C.C. Saraiva L.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2007; 51: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the physiological consequences of the action of CO-RMs on bacteria addressed by global transcriptional analysis revealed that CO-RMs induce a significant alteration on the bacterial transcriptome. In particular, induction of genes encoding two main redox-sensing regulators that control the bacterial oxidative response, SoxS and OxyR, occurs in cells exposed to CORM-2, and Escherichia coli strains lacking oxyR and soxS genes exhibit enhanced susceptibility to CORM-2, altogether suggesting that CO potentiates the generation of reactive oxygen species (8Nobre L.S. Al-Shahrour F. Dopazo J. Saraiva L.M. Microbiology. 2009; 155: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The generation of intracellular ROS causes deterioration of DNA, lipids, and proteins and several targets have been linked to loss of cell integrity and/or viability (9Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. Int. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar). DNA is especially prone to iron-catalyzed oxidation, as iron binds directly to the phosphodiester backbone where OH radicals are subsequently generated (10Imlay J.A. Linn S. Science. 1988; 240: 1302-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar, 11Avery S.V. Biochem. J. 2011; 434: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In particular, guanine residues on DNA are targets of oxidation as well as thiol groups and iron-sulfur clusters of proteins (9Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. Int. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brzóska K. Meczyńska S. Kruszewski M. Acta Biochim. Pol. 2006; 53: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Besides loss of function, denaturation of iron-sulfur clusters contributes itself to toxicity because the iron that is released upon oxidation of the clusters provokes additional oxidative damage via the Fenton reaction (11Avery S.V. Biochem. J. 2011; 434: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 13Keyer K. Imlay J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 13635-13640Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar).Nevertheless, bacteria have several mechanisms to avoid this outcome. The typical responses to ROS include DNA repair systems (e.g. RecA), the action of scavenging molecules (e.g. glutathione) and detoxification systems, like superoxide dismutase and catalase (9Cabiscol E. Tamarit J. Ros J. Int. Microbiol. 2000; 3: 3-8PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, oxidative conditions have been shown to trigger the Isc and Suf systems, which are responsible for the de novo assembly of iron-sulfur clusters in nascent polypeptides (14Ayala-Castro C. Saini A. Outten F.W. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2008; 72: 110-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 15Johnson D.C. Dean D.R. Smith A.D. Johnson M.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 247-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar).In the present work we have exposed bacterial cultures to CO-releasing molecules and determined the effect of these compounds on cell viability upon addition of antioxidants, measured the level of ROS, analyzed the deletion of ROS scavenging systems, observed the degree of DNA damage, evaluated the status of iron and iron-sulfur enzymes, and tested the generation of oxygen radicals by the CO-releasing molecules. Altogether, the data revealed that the bactericidal action of CO-releasing molecules relies on the generation of deleterious intracellular oxidative stress conditions."

Therefore, we hypothesized that the bundling ability of Fim1 is dispensable for actin patches but is important for the contractile ring and possibly actin cables. By directly visualizing actin filament assembly using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we determined that Fim1 bundles filaments in both parallel and antiparallel orientations and efficiently bundles Arp2/3 complex-branched filaments in the absence but not the presence of actin capping protein. Examination of cells exclusively expressing a truncated version of Fim1 that can bind but not bundle actin filaments revealed that bundling activity of Fim1 is in fact important for all three actin structures.

https://openalex.org/W2065552057,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are a novel class of cellular bioactive molecules with critical functions in the regulation of gene expression in normal biology and disease. MiRs are frequently misexpressed in cancer, with potent biological consequences. However, relatively little is known about miRs in pediatric cancers, including sarcomas. Moreover, the mechanisms behind aberrant miR expression in cancer are poorly understood. Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric malignancy driven by EWS/Ets fusion oncoproteins, which are gain-of-function transcriptional regulators. We employed stable silencing of EWS/Fli1, the most common of the oncogenic fusions, and global miR profiling to identify EWS/Fli1-regulated miRs with oncogenesis-modifying roles in Ewing sarcoma. In this report, we characterize a group of miRs (100, 125b, 22, 221/222, 27a and 29a) strongly repressed by EWS/Fli1. Strikingly, all of these miRs have predicted targets in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, a pivotal driver of Ewing sarcoma oncogenesis. We demonstrate that miRs in this group negatively regulate the expression of multiple pro-oncogenic components of the IGF pathway, namely IGF-1, IGF-1 receptor, mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin and ribosomal protein S6 kinase A1. Consistent with tumor-suppressive functions, these miRs manifest growth inhibitory properties in Ewing sarcoma cells. Our studies thus uncover a novel oncogenic mechanism in Ewing sarcoma, involving post-transcriptional derepression of IGF signaling by the EWS/Fli1 fusion oncoprotein via miRs. This novel pathway may be amenable to innovative therapeutic targeting in Ewing sarcoma and other malignancies with activated IGF signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2009655341,"Identification of physiologically relevant substrates is still the most challenging part in protease research for understanding the biological activity of these enzymes. The zinc-dependent metalloprotease meprin β is known to be expressed in many tissues with functions in health and disease. Here, we demonstrate unique interactions between meprin β and the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Although APP is intensively studied as a ubiquitously expressed cell surface protein, which is involved in Alzheimer disease, its precise physiological role and relevance remain elusive. Based on a novel proteomics technique termed terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), APP was identified as a substrate for meprin β. Processing of APP by meprin β was subsequently validated using in vitro and in vivo approaches. N-terminal APP fragments of about 11 and 20 kDa were found in human and mouse brain lysates but not in meprin β(-/-) mouse brain lysates. Although these APP fragments were in the range of those responsible for caspase-induced neurodegeneration, we did not detect cytotoxicity to primary neurons treated by these fragments. Our data demonstrate that meprin β is a physiologically relevant enzyme in APP processing."

Deregulation of the cell cycle machinery is considered to be a factor in tumor generation.

Recent studies have suggested that several miRNA-targeted genes are involved in cell cycle progression and cellular growth (4Wu W. Sun M. Zou G.M. Chen J. Int. J. Cancer. 2007; 120: 953-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar).

However, in this work, we found that miR-372 has the opposite role in HeLa cells. We explored the effects of miR-372 on cell growth and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, CDK2 and cyclin A1 were identified as direct targets of miR-372. Therefore, our data indicate that miR-372 directly targets CDK2 and cyclin A1 and negatively regulates cell cycle progression and proliferation in HeLa cells. The human cervical cancer-derived cell lines, HeLa and C33A, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen). The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. The HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiency was monitored by fluorescence microscopy 48 h after transfection with pcDNA3/EGFP and Cy5-oligonucleotides. Stably transfected cells were selected by adding 0.4 mg/ml G418 to the culture medium. Individual colonies were selected 2 weeks after transfection, and miRNA levels were quantified using real-time PCR. Treated cells were plated in 24-well plates (4,000 cells/well) in triplicate. At the different times, the cells were detached by trypsinization and counted using a hemocytometer. Transfected HeLa cells (or stable cell lines) were seeded in 6-well plates for 24 h in complete medium. Subsequently, the cells were deprived of serum for harvesting and then returned to complete medium for an additional 24 h. All cells were collected by centrifugation, fixed in 95% ethanol, incubated at −20 °C overnight, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Then cells were resuspended in 1 ml of FACS solution (PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 60 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/ml DNase-free RNase, and 0.1% trisodium citrate). After a final incubation on ice for 30 min, cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). A total of 10,000 events were counted for each sample. The HeLa cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 4,000 cells/well. 48 h after transient transfection, the cells were incubated with 15 μl of MTT (at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) at 37 °C for another 4 h. Then the medium was removed, and the precipitated formazan was dissolved in 100 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). After shaking for 15 min, the absorbance at 570 nm (A570) was detected using a μQuant universal microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT). To construct a plasmid expressing miR-372, a 341-bp DNA fragment carrying pri-miR-372 was inserted between the BamHI and EcoRI sites in pcDNA3. The EGFP reporter vector pcDNA3/EGFP was constructed as described previously (16Liu T. Tang H. Lang Y. Liu M. Li X. Cancer Lett. 2009; 273: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The 3′-UTRs, including the target sites, of human CDK2 and cyclin A1 were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned downstream of EGFP between the EcoRI and BamHI (or XhoI) sites. Similarly, 3′-UTR mutants, which contained mutated miR-372 binding sites, were cloned to the pcDNA3/EGFP between the same sites. The primer sequences used for RT-PCR amplification are shown in Table 1. Sequences that were inserted into the plasmid were verified by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Oligonucleotides used in this workNameSequence (5′ → 3′)aRestriction sites are underlined.pri-miR-372 senseGTTACGGATCCAGATCTCTCAACCTGCGGAGAAGATACpri-miR-372 antisenseCAGCCGAATTCTGTAAGGGACCTGTACCCAAGACAGCyclin A1 forwardGCGGATCCTTGCCTGAGTGAGCCyclin A1 reverseGCGAATTCGCAGAAGCCTATGACDK2 forwardGCGAATTCCCCAGCCCTAATCTCACDK2 reverseGCCTCGAGAACCCTCTTCAGCAATAACyclinA1-mut forwardCTGAATGGATGGAGTACCAGAACTTCCyclinA1-mut reverseGAAGTTCTGGTACTCCATCCATTCAGCDK2-mut forwardGTATTAGATGGTCATAAGTTAGCCCDK2-mut reverseGGCTAACTTATGACCATCTAATACU6-RTGTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACAAAATATGGAACmiR-372-RTGTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACACGCTCU6 forwardTGCGGGTGCTCGCTTCGGCAGCmiR-372 forwardGCCCGCAAAGTGCTGCGACATReverse (universal)CCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTActin forwardCGTGACATTAAGGAGAAGCTGActin reverseCTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGACa Restriction sites are underlined. Open table in a new tab HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3/pri-miR-372, control vector, miR-372 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), control ASO, or the reporter plasmids described above in 48-well plates. An expression vector expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP), pDsRedz-N1 (Clontech), was used for normalization. The cells were lysed with radio immunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40), and 48 h later, protein was harvested. EGFP and RFP expression was detected using a fluorescence spectrophotometer F-4500 (Hitachi). All assays were performed more than three times. The cells were transfected and then lysed 48 h later with radio immunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, after which the proteins were harvested. An equal amount of protein was loaded onto a 12% SDS denaturing polyacrylamide gel, separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated with the specific primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed and subsequently incubated with the secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Protein was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. Anti-cyclin A1, anti-CDK2, and anti-GAPDH antibodies were purchased from Saierbio, Inc. The resulting Western blot bands were quantified using the LabWorksTM 4.0 software. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For miRNA detection, 2 μg of small RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis for miR-372 was performed in triplicate with the SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM kit (TaKaRa) according to the manufacturer's instructions. U6 RNA was used to normalize expression. To detect the target genes, 5 μg of large RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of cyclin A1 and CDK2 using the primers described in Table 1. β-Actin levels were used to normalize expression. The data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. from at least three separate experiments. The differences between groups were analyzed using the double-sided Student's t test, and statistical significance was determined by a p value of less than 0.05. Recent evidence suggests that miR-372 is tumorigenic; however, we found that it may play a different role in cervical cancer. We measured the expression levels of miR-372 in 18 pairs of human cervical cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues using real-time PCR. We found that miR-372 expression levels were generally lower in cervical cancer tissues than in the matched normal cervical tissues, with the exception of one sample (Fig. 1), suggesting that miR-372 expression is down-regulated in cervical cancer. Gain-of-function experiments are widely used for functional studies of miRNAs. To investigate the role of miR-372 in tumor cell growth, a miR-372 overexpression vector, pcDNA/pri-miR-372, was constructed. miR-372 overexpression from the vector was confirmed by qRT-PCR, which indicated a 4.3-fold increase of miR-372 expression in pri-miR-372-transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, panel 1). To characterize the effects of miR-372 on cell growth, HeLa cells were transfected with pri-miR-372, and growth was monitored using a cell growth curve, which indicated that overexpression of miR-372 inhibited cell growth (Fig. 2B, panel 1). HeLa cell lines stably expressing miR-372 were then selected, and miRNA activity was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Fig. 2A, panel 2). As seen in the transiently transfected cells, the growth of HeLa cells stably expressing miR-372 was about 50% slower than control cells (Fig. 2B, panel 2). To further explore the role of miR-372, experiments with loss-of-function analyses were performed. A miR-372 ASO was used to block miR-372 and resulted in an ∼70% reduction of miR-372 in HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, panel 3). To determine whether inhibiting miR-372 could reverse the inhibition of cellular proliferation observed by overexpression, we transfected the HeLa cells stably expressing miR-372 with miR-372 ASO or a negative control ASO. An increase in proliferation was observed in cells transfected with miR-372 ASO as compared with cells transfected with the control (Fig. 2B, panel 3). These studies indicate that HeLa cell growth can be negatively modulated by miR-372. To follow up the finding that miR-372 overexpression decreased the growth of HeLa cells, FACS was used to analyze the cell cycle of pri-miR-372-treated HeLa cells. Overexpression of miR-372 resulted in an increase of cells in S phase (from 25.3 to 38.4%), a decrease of cells in G2/M phase (from 21.8 to 7.6%), and no change in the percentage of cells in G1 phase, as compared with the negative control (Fig. 3A). Additionally, In HeLa cell lines stably overexpressing miR-372, a larger percentage of cells was found in S phase as compared with cells without miR-372 overexpression (Fig. 3B). Therefore, miR-372 overexpression increases accumulation of cells in S phase and decreases entrance into G2/M in HeLa cells. We also used ASO to block miR-372 in HeLa-372 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C, blocking miR-372 rescued the cell cycle arrest, with about 10% more cells progressing from S phase into G2. This observation is consistent with the result of our gain-of-function analysis. All above results indicated that miR-372 caused cell cycle arrest at the S/G2 phase in HeLa cells but is not known whether miR-372 interferes with DNA synthesis in the S phase. The EdU incorporation assay showed that although miR-372 suppresses cell proliferation, the percentage of EdU-positive cells was increased (supplemental Fig. S1). It demonstrates miR-372 has an effect on the S/G2 checkpoint. To further validate miR-372-mediated cell cycle arrest in cervical cancer cells, another cell line, C33A, was used to study the effect of miR-372 on cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation. These results were consistent with previous results in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. S2), indicating that miR-372 may negatively affect growth at the S-to-G2 transition in cervical cancer cells. As the function of miR-372 is determined, it is important to understand which targets are directly responsible for the observed downstream phenotypes. Four algorithm programs (TargetScan, PicTar, miRCosm, and mirnaviewer) were used to predict candidate target genes. Matchminer was used to identify the genes predicted by all four different algorithms. Given the cell cycle phenotype, gene ontology (GO) analysis (AmiGO) was used to search human genes associated with the cell cycle. We then selected CDK2 and cyclin A1, whose 3′-UTR contained the potential binding sites of miR-372, to be the candidate target genes (see Fig. 6A). We used bioinformatic predictions to determine CDK2 and cyclin A1 expression levels in 18 pairs of cervical cancers and the adjacent normal tissues by qRT-PCR. We found that CDK2 and cyclin A1 generally had higher expression levels in the cervical cancer tissue as compared with normal tissue (Fig. 4A). High expression of CDK2 and cyclin A1 inversely correlated with lower expression of miR-372 in human cervical cancer (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Quantitative analysis of CDK2 and cyclin A1 expression in human cervical cancer. A, the expression levels of miR-372 targets-CDK2 and cyclin A1 were measured by qRT-PCR. The 18 pairs of cervical cancer tissues (Ca) from Fig. 1 were used again to measure the relative CDK2 and cyclin A1 expression levels, as well as the combined levels. β-Actin was used as the endogenous normalizer (*, p < 0.05).

When miR-372 was overexpressed, mRNA and protein levels of CDK2 and cyclin A1 were markedly reduced (Fig. 5, A and B). In HeLa cell lines stably overexpressing miR-372, CDK2 and cyclin A1 protein levels were also found down-regulated (Fig. 5C). Conversely, inhibiting miR-372 expression resulted in up-regulation of CDK2 and cyclin A1 protein levels (Fig. 5D). These observations indicate that CDK2 and cyclin A1 are negatively regulated by miR-372 at the post-transcriptional level. To determine whether the interaction between miR-372 and the mRNA of CDK2 and cyclin A1 is direct, we used an EGFP reporter system in which we cloned the CDK2 or cyclin A1 3′-UTR fragments containing presumed target sites to downstream of an EGFP. Subsequently, we constructed an additional EGFP reporter vector containing the 3′-UTR of either CDK2 or cyclin A1 with the potential mutant target sites of miR-372 seed sequence (Fig. 6A). Co-transfection was performed with an RFP reporter and with either a miR-372 vector or ASO in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 6, B and C, the intensity of EGFP fluorescence in HeLa cells transfected with pcDNA3/EGFP-CDK2 3′-UTR or pcDNA3/EGFP-cyclin A1 3′-UTR and pcDNA3/pri-miR-372 was decreased as compared with the control group by 20–30%. Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous miR-372 by ASO increased EGFP expression from the reporter construct containing the 3′-UTR of CDK2 or cyclin A1 by 20%. Importantly, expression of the reporter constructs mutated at the miR-372 target site of CDK2 or cyclin A1 3′-UTR was not affected by either miR-372 overexpression or inhibition, highlighting the importance of the miR-372 binding site for regulation by miR-372. These results show that miR-372 regulates gene expression through direct binding of the 3′-UTR of CDK2 and cyclin A1 in HeLa cells. Next, we constructed CDK2 and cyclin A1 siRNA expression vector to explore the role of CDK2 and cyclin A1 in cell cycle regulation (see supplemental Experimental Procedures). The results indicated that the CDK2 and cyclin A1 siRNA could significantly reduce endogenous protein levels (supplemental Fig. S3A). CDK2 and cyclin A1 knockdown resulted in an increase of cells in S phase and a decrease of cells in G2/M phase (supplemental Fig. S3B), which is consistent with the results of miR-372 overexpression. To further investigate the relationship between CDK2 and cyclin A1 with miR-372-mediated cell cycle inhibition, we overexpressed miR-372 with CDK2 or cyclin A1 together in HeLa cells. Cell growth was measured using a MTT assay, and cell cycle progression was analyzed using FACS. We found that overexpression of CDK2 or cyclin A1 with miR-372 reversed the inhibition of cell growth and the arrested cell cycle at S/G2 phase caused by miR-372 (Fig. 7, A and B). Therefore, we conclude that overexpression of CDK2 and cyclin A1 counteracts the repressive effects of miR-372 on cell growth and cell cycle progression. Over the past few years, hundreds of miRNAs have been described that play important roles in regulating gene expression by mRNA cleavage or translational repression in a variety of model systems (2Bartel D.P.

Documented evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs may function as a novel class of both tumorigenic and tumor-suppressing genes (19Zhang B. Pan X. Cobb G.P. Anderson T.A. Dev. Biol. 2007; 302: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2204) Google Scholar). For example, miR-17–92 is significantly increased in both small cell lung cancers and human B-cell lymphomas and plays a key role in tumorigenesis (20Hayashita Y. Osada H. Tatematsu Y. Yamada H.

Let-7 could directly regulate multiple cell cycle-associated tumorigenesis proteins (CDK6, CDC25a, CCND2) and thus potentially act as a tumor suppressor gene (22Johnson S.M. Grosshans H. Shingara J.

Overexpression of miR-372 in human cervical cancer cell lines suppresses cell growth and arrests the cell cycle at S/G2 phase. miRNA and their specific targets are dependent on the specific cellular environment (26Meltzer P.S. Nature. 2005; 435: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). For example, miRNA-155 is significantly up-regulated in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (27Eis P.S. Tam W. Sun L. Chadburn A. Li Z. Gomez M.F. Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar) and is down-regulated in human breast cancer (27Eis P.S. Tam W.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7065-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (3498) Google Scholar). Depending on which factors are driving tumorigenesis in the specific cellular milieu, the same miRNA may act as a tumor suppressor in some cancers and as a tumorigenic agent in others. Therefore, we speculate that cell-specific environments may account for the differences observed between the functions of miR-372 in cervical cancer as compared with other cancers. Cell cycle progression is highly complex and is controlled by many factors. Deregulation of the cell cycle leads to abnormal cell growth and tumorigenesis (30Carleton M. Cleary M.A. Linsley P.S.

Cyclins are regarded as the major regulators of the cell cycle (33Arellano M. Moreno S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 559-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 34Obaya A.J.

Nature. 1989; 339: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). All kinds of cyclin expression present periodic variations in cell cycle (36Rosenthal E.T. Hunt T. Ruderman J.V. Cell. 1980; 20: 487-494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Cyclin A1 is an alternative, A-type cyclin that is present at very low levels in cells during G0. It increases throughout the progression of the cell cycle and reaches the highest levels in S and G2/M (37Yang R. Müller C. Huynh V. Fung Y.K. Yee A.S. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2400-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, CDKs are another class of cell cycle regulators that act as the catalytic subunit of the active cyclin-CDK complex, which is key to coordination of the cell cycle (38Li A. Blow J.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E182-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar). CDK2 is thought to be essential in the mammalian cell cycle and functions by driving cells through S phase in conjunction with A-type cyclins (40Ortega S. Prieto I. Odajima J. Martín A. Dubus P. Sotillo R. Barbero J.L. Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 25-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). CDK2 is also essential for spermatogenesis and contributes to leukemogenesis (41Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar, 42Yang R. Nakamaki T. Lübbert M. Said J. Sakashita A. Freyaldenhoven B.S. Spira S. Huynh V. Müller C. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2067-2074PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclin A1-CDK2 complex is crucial for successful DNA replication and normal cell cycle progression. Our phenotypic analyses revealed that miR-372 inhibits HeLa cell growth and induces cell cycle arrest, which increases the percentage of cells in S phase and blocks entry into G2. We then identified cyclin A1 and CDK2 as target genes of miR-372. Our results can be summarized by six major findings. (a) We combined bioinformatic prediction software including TargetScan, PicTar, miRCosm, and mirnaviewer with human gene associations of the cell cycle and compiled the resulting data using the AmiGO website. The cell cycle regulators, cyclin A1 and CDK2, were predicted to be candidate targets for further study. (b) We found that miR-372 is down-regulated, whereas CDK2 and cyclin A1 are up-regulated in cervical cancer tissue as compared with adjacent normal tissue. (c) miR-372 negatively regulates cyclin A1 and CDK2 at both mRNA and protein levels. (d) Expression of the EGFP reporter containing the 3′-UTR of cyclin A1 and CDK2 was inhibited when miR-372 was overexpressed. (e) It was also demonstrated that overexpression of CDK2 and cyclin A1 accelerates DNA replication in S-phase, entry into G2, and vice versa (43Coletta R.D. Christensen K. Reichenberger K.J. Lamb J. Micomonaco D. Huang L. Wolf D.M. Müller-Tidow C. Golub T.R. Kawakami K. Ford H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 6478-6483Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 44Hu B. Mitra J. van den Heuvel S. Enders G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2755-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). (f) Expression of CDK2 and cyclin A1 is sufficient to rescue miR-372-mediated cell cycle repression and to promote cell growth. Accordingly, we conclude that miR-372 targets cyclin A1 and CDK2. LATS2 is a tumor suppressor gene that induces G2/M arrest through the inhibition of Cdc2 kinase activity in HeLa cells (29Kamikubo Y. Takaori-Kondo A. Uchiyama T. Hori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17609-17614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, it was suggested that LATS2 is also a functional target of miR-372 in gastric cancer cells and testicular germ cell tumors (14Voorhoeve P.M. le Sage C. Schrier M. Gillis A.J. Stoop H. Nagel R. Liu Y.P. van Duijse J. Drost J. Griekspoor A. Zlotorynski E. Yabuta N. De Vita G. Nojima H. Looijenga L.H. Agami R.

Because miR-372 is down-regulated in human cervical cancer cells, the previously identified tumor suppressor gene LATS2 could not help us understand the effect of miR-372 on cell cycle regulation in cervical cancer cells, but characterizing the detailed mechanism remains to be understood. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-372 suppresses the growth of HeLa cells by directly targeting cyclin A1 and CDK2, which represses cell cycle progression. Additionally, miR-372 functions as a tumor suppressor in cervical cancer. We thank the College of Public Health of Tianjin Medical University for technical assistance with fluorescence detection.

https://openalex.org/W2040108806,"Ovarian cancers migrate and metastasize over the surface of the peritoneal cavity. Consequently, dysregulation of mechanisms that limit cell migration may be particularly important in the pathogenesis of the disease. ARHI is an imprinted tumor-suppressor gene that is downregulated in >60% of ovarian cancers, and its loss is associated with decreased progression-free survival. ARHI encodes a 26-kDa GTPase with homology to Ras. In contrast to Ras, ARHI inhibits cell growth, but whether it also regulates cell motility has not been studied previously. Here we report that re-expression of ARHI decreases the motility of IL-6- and epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated SKOv3 and Hey ovarian cancer cells, inhibiting both chemotaxis and haptotaxis. ARHI binds to and sequesters Stat3 in the cytoplasm, preventing its translocation to the nucleus and localization in focal adhesion complexes. Stat3 siRNA or the JAK2 inhibitor AG490 produced similar inhibition of motility. However, the combination of ARHI expression with Stat3 knockdown or inhibition produced greatest inhibition in ovarian cancer cell migration, consistent with Stat3-dependent and Stat3-independent mechanisms. Consistent with two distinct signaling pathways, knockdown of Stat3 selectively inhibited IL-6-stimulated migration, whereas knockdown of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) preferentially inhibited EGF-stimulated migration. In EGF-stimulated ovarian cancer cells, re-expression of ARHI inhibited FAK(Y397) and Src(Y416) phosphorylation, disrupted focal adhesions, and blocked FAK-mediated RhoA signaling, resulting in decreased levels of GTP-RhoA. Re-expression of ARHI also disrupted the formation of actin stress fibers in a FAK- and RhoA-dependent manner. Thus, ARHI has a critical and previously uncharacterized role in the regulation of ovarian cancer cell migration, exerting inhibitory effects on two distinct signaling pathways."

https://openalex.org/W2025311938,"Drug efflux represents an important protection mechanism in bacteria to withstand antibiotics and environmental toxic substances. Efflux genes constitute 6–18% of all transporters in bacterial genomes, yet the expression and functions of only a handful of them have been studied. Among the 20 efflux genes encoded in the Escherichia coli K-12 genome, only the AcrAB-TolC system is constitutively expressed. The expression, activities, and physiological functions of the remaining efflux genes are poorly understood. In this study we identified a dramatic up-regulation of an additional efflux pump, MdtEF, under the anaerobic growth condition of E. coli, which is independent of antibiotic exposure. We found that expression of MdtEF is up-regulated more than 20-fold under anaerobic conditions by the global transcription factor ArcA, resulting in increased efflux activity and enhanced drug tolerance in anaerobically grown E. coli. Cells lacking mdtEF display a significantly decreased survival rate under the condition of anaerobic respiration of nitrate. Deletion of the genes responsible for the biosynthesis of indole, tnaAB, or replacing nitrate with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor during the anaerobic respiration restores the decreased survival of ΔmdtEF cells. Moreover, ΔmdtEF cells are susceptible to indole nitrosative derivatives, a class of toxic byproducts formed and accumulated within E. coli when the bacterium respires nitrate under anaerobic conditions. Taken together, we conclude that the multidrug efflux pump MdtEF is up-regulated during the anaerobic physiology of E. coli to protect the bacterium from nitrosative damage through expelling the nitrosyl indole derivatives out of the cells.

https://openalex.org/W2091881483,"The expression of small, non-coding RNA or microRNAs (miR), is frequently deregulated in human cancer, but how these pathways affect disease progression is still largely elusive. Here, we report on a miR, miR-296, which is progressively lost during tumor progression and correlates with metastatic disease in colorectal, breast, lung, gastric, parathyroid, liver and bile ducts cancers. Functionally, miR-296 controls a global cell motility gene signature in epithelial cells by transcriptionally repressing the cell polarity–cell plasticity module, Scribble (Scrib). In turn, loss of miR-296 causes aberrantly increased and mislocalized Scrib in human tumors, resulting in exaggerated random cell migration and tumor cell invasiveness. Re-expression of miR-296 in MDA-MB231 cells inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Finally, miR-296 or Scrib levels predict tumor relapse in hepatocellular carcinoma patients. These data identify miR-296 as a global repressor of tumorigenicity and uncover a previously unexplored exploitation of Scrib in tumor progression in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2166522383,"TP53(tumour protein 53) is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancer and its role during cellular transformation has been studied extensively. However, the homeostatic functions of p53 are less well understood. Here, we explore the molecular dependency network of TP53 through an RNAi-mediated synthetic interaction screen employing two HCT116 isogenic cell lines and a genome-scale endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering RNA library. We identify a variety of TP53 synthetic interactions unmasking the complex connections of p53 to cellular physiology and growth control. Molecular dissection of the TP53 synthetic interaction with UNRIP indicates an enhanced dependency of TP53-negative cells on small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) assembly. This dependency is mediated by the snoRNP chaperone gene NOLC1 (also known as NOPP140), which we identify as a physiological p53 target gene. This unanticipated function of TP53 in snoRNP assembly highlights the potential of RNAi-mediated synthetic interaction screens to dissect molecular pathways of tumour suppressor genes. A genome-wide RNAi synthetic lethal screen unravels the role of p53 in small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs) through a genetic interaction with UNRIP, which has been previously shown to interact with the snoRNP chaperone SMN. p53 regulates the levels of Nolc1, which affects snoRNP stability, whereas UNRIP contributes to nuclear SMN import, revealing a synergistic requirement for both in snoRNP assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2070033870,"As glucocorticoid resistance (GCR) and the concomitant burden pose a worldwide problem, there is an urgent need for a more effective glucocorticoid therapy, for which insights into the molecular mechanisms of GCR are essential. In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that TNFα, a strong pro-inflammatory mediator in numerous inflammatory diseases, compromises the protective function of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) against TNFα-induced lethal inflammation. Indeed, protection of mice by dexamethasone against TNFα lethality was completely abolished when it was administered after TNFα stimulation, indicating compromised GR function upon TNFα challenge. TNFα-induced GCR was further demonstrated by impaired GR-dependent gene expression in the liver. Furthermore, TNFα down-regulates the levels of both GR mRNA and protein. However, this down-regulation seems to occur independently of GC production, as TNFα also resulted in down-regulation of GR levels in adrenalectomized mice. These findings suggest that the decreased amount of GR determines the GR response and outcome of TNFα-induced shock, as supported by our studies with GR heterozygous mice. We propose that by inducing GCR, TNFα inhibits a major brake on inflammation and thereby amplifies the pro-inflammatory response. Our findings might prove helpful in understanding GCR in inflammatory diseases in which TNFα is intimately involved."
https://openalex.org/W2050913264,"Inflammatory cytokine-regulated apoptosis and autophagy play pivotal roles in plaque rupture and thrombosis of atherosclerotic lesions. However, the molecular interplay between apoptosis and autophagy in vascular cells has not been investigated. Our prior study showed that human apolipoprotein L6 (ApoL6), a pro-apoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, was one of the downstream targets of interferon-γ (INFγ), which sensitizes atherosclerotic lesion-derived cells (LDCs) to Fas-induced apoptosis. To investigate whether ApoL6 plays a causal role in atherosclerotic apoptosis and autophagy, in this study, we demonstrate that IFNγ treatment itself strongly induces ApoL6, and ApoL6 is highly expressed and partially co-localized with activated caspase 3 in activated smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, overexpression of ApoL6 promotes reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, caspase activation, and subsequent apoptosis, which can be blocked by pan caspase inhibitor and ROS scavenger. Knockdown of ApoL6 expression by siApoL6 suppresses INFγ- and Fas-mediated apoptosis. Further, ApoL6 binds Bcl-XL, one of the most abundant anti-death proteins in LDCs. Interestingly, forced ApoL6 expression in LDCs induces degradation of Beclin 1, accumulation of p62, and subsequent attenuation of LC3-II formation and translocation and thus autophagy, whereas siApoL6 treatment reverts the phenotype.

Bennett M. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2329-2331Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 10Doran A.C. Meller N. McNamara C.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 812-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). However, when apoptosis occurs in SMCs in the thin fibrous cap of advanced lesions, the plaque is prone to rupture, thereby triggering thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Thus, apoptosis is a major contributing factor to plaque instability and sudden coronary death (7Bauriedel G. Hutter R. Welsch U. Bach R. Sievert H. Lüderitz B. Cardiovasc.

Autophagy, a cell survival mechanism, has been shown to induce type II programmed cell death (13Ravikumar B. Sarkar S. Davies J.E. Futter M. Garcia-Arencibia M. Green-Thompson Z.W. Jimenez-Sanchez M.

Autophagy is an intracellular recycling process in which unwanted organelles and macromolecules are delivered and catabolized by lysosome-mediated degradation. Currently, there are 34 autophagy (Atg) genes identified as essential regulators and/or direct participants in autophagic pathways (13Ravikumar B. Sarkar S. Davies J.E. Futter M. Garcia-Arencibia M. Green-Thompson Z.W. Jimenez-Sanchez M. Korolchuk V.I. Lichtenberg M. Luo S. Massey D.C. Menzies F.M. Moreau K. Narayanan U. Renna M. Siddiqi F.H. Underwood B.R. Winslow A.R. Rubinsztein D.C. Physiol. Rev. 2010; 90: 1383-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar). For example, Beclin 1, or Atg 6/Vsp30, a regulatory component of the Class III PI3K complex, is essential for the initiation of autophagy. Overexpression of Beclin 1 induces autophagy, whereas down-regulation of Beclin 1 blocks autophagy (15Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2956) Google Scholar). In addition, LC3, or Atg8, is also essential for the autophagy pathway: activation and translocation of lipidated LC3-II to autophagosomes is correlated with the induction of autophagy and is one of the markers of autophagy (13Ravikumar B. Sarkar S. Davies J.E. Futter M. Garcia-Arencibia M. Green-Thompson Z.W. Jimenez-Sanchez M. Korolchuk V.I. Lichtenberg M. Luo S. Massey D.C. Menzies F.M. Moreau K. Narayanan U. Renna M. Siddiqi F.H.

Chem. 2008; 283: 21540-21549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In vascular cells, it is believed that autophagy supports survival, and plays an important role in the etiology of cardiomyopathy and atherosclerosis (3Jia G. Cheng G. Agrawal D.K. Autophagy. 2007; 3: 63-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 4Martinet W. De Meyer G.R.Y. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 304-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 16Jia G. Cheng G.

Sadoshima J. Vatner S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 13807-13812Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of autophagy in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains poorly understood. The crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy through specific regulators in SMCs may decide the overall fate of the cell. It has been shown that increased apoptosis occurs in advanced human atherosclerotic lesions and is frequently associated with clinically unstable coronary artery lesions (6Hansson G.K. Robertson A.K. Söoderberg-Nauclér C. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2006; 1: 297-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 7Bauriedel G. Hutter R. Welsch U. Bach R. Sievert H. Lüderitz B. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 480-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In general, apoptosis can be initiated extrinsically (through death receptors, e.g. Fas) or intrinsically (through mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum stress), and all cell types present in atherosclerotic lesions can undergo apoptosis (18Boyle J.J. Bowyer D.E. Weissberg P.L. Bennett M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19Green D.R.

Atherosclerosis. 2002; 161: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Importantly, cells undergoing apoptosis need to be efficiently removed in atherosclerotic lesions. If not, rapid exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells is a potent inducer of the generation of thrombin and activation of the coagulant cascade (21Kavurma M.M. Tan N.Y. Bennett M.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1694-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 22Seimon T. Tabas I. J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S382-S387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, it has been shown that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by lipid-loaded macrophages is severely impaired in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, resulting in accumulation of proinflammatory necrotic debris and plaque instability (23Schrijvers D.M. De Meyer G.R. Kockx M.M. Herman A.G. Martinet W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1256-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 24Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2255-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Moreover, the intracellular autophagy pathway in lipid-loaded macrophages has also been shown to be impaired (25Schrijvers D.M. De Meyer G.R. Herman A.G. Martinet W. Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 73: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, a better understanding of how apoptosis and autophagy are being regulated in vascular lesion cells is essential. The Bcl-2 family members play critical roles in regulating and fine-tuning both apoptosis and autophagy, and their homeostatic balance determines cell fate (26Chipuk J.E. Moldoveanu T. Llambi F. Parsons M.J. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar, 27Kutuk O. Basaga H. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1661-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 28Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). In a rabbit atherosclerotic model, increased levels of Bcl-XL, an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, have been found in the intima of early proliferative lesions and the down-regulation of Bcl-XL in neointima resulted in apoptosis of vascular cells and the regression of lesions (29Pollman M.J. Hall J.L. Mann M.J. Zhang L. Gibbons G.H. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Likewise, higher Bcl-XL levels were observed in apoptosis-resistant cells of human advanced lesions compared with control specimens, and had a protective effect against apoptotic insults (30Saxena A. McMeekin J.D. Thomson D.J. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, our prior work in transcript profiling of lesion-derived cell (LDC) apoptosis revealed that up-regulated expression of Bcl-XL is a major determinant of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis (31Gagarin D. Yang Z. Butler J. Wimmer M. Du B. Cahan P. McCaffrey T.A. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 39: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32Yang Z. Gagarin D. Ramezani A. Hawley R.G. McCaffrey T.A. J. Vasc. Res. 2007; 44: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Subsequent investigation demonstrated that LDCs had elevated Bcl-XL mRNA and protein that conferred resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis, which can be blocked by small molecule inhibitors or siRNA-knockdown of Bcl-XL (32Yang Z. Gagarin D. Ramezani A. Hawley R.G. McCaffrey T.A. J. Vasc. Res. 2007; 44: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, Bcl-XL is a potent apoptosis inhibitor in human LDCs. Moreover, recent evidence showed that apoptosis and autophagy are intimately interconnected, by sharing key molecular regulators, such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Beclin 1 (33Lomonosova E. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 2008; 27: S2-S19Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Utilizing microarray profiling, quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblot analysis, we recently showed that ApoL6, a BH3-only pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, was one of the 36 major downstream targets of INFγ-sensitized, Fas-induced apoptosis in LDCs (34Yang Z. Gagarin D. St Laurent 3rd, G. Hammell N. Toma I. Hu C.A. Iwasa A. McCaffrey T.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These cell lines were originally isolated from the fibrous cap of human atherosclerotic lesions, possessing characteristics of myofibroblasts and were resistant to the antiproliferative effects of transforming growth factor-β and the pro-apoptotic effects of Fas ligation, similar to activated, apoptosis-resistant SMCs in neointima (35Du B. Fu C. Kent K.C. Bush Jr., H. Schulick A.H. Kreiger K. Collins T. McCaffrey T.A. J. Biol.

Silverman E.S. Collins T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although we documented that overexpression of ApoL6 induced mitochondria- and caspase 8-mediated apoptosis by release of apoptogenic factors from mitochondria and activation of caspases in various cells, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (37Liu Z. Lu H. Jiang Z. Pastuszyn A. Hu C.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar), the role of ApoL6 in atherosclerosis has not been explored. In this study, we investigated the link between ApoL6, ROS, Bcl-XL, Beclin 1, and p62 in atherosclerotic plaque apoptosis and autophagy. LDCs, with characteristics of SMC-like myofibroblasts, were established from the fibrous cap of human carotid artery atherosclerotic lesions as previously described (31Gagarin D. Yang Z. Butler J. Wimmer M. Du B. Cahan P. McCaffrey T.A. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2005; 39: 453-465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 36McCaffrey T.A. Fu C. Du B. Eksinar S. Kent K.C.

Prior microarray analysis indicates that LDCs express several consensus markers of SMC-like myofibroblasts including smooth muscle α-actin (ACTA2), smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MYH11), calponin 1 (CNN1), aortic preferentially expressed protein 1 (APEG1), and SM22a/transgelin (TAGLN). LDCs were sensitized by IFNγ (10 nm; R&D Systems) to Fas-induced apoptosis as described (32Yang Z. Gagarin D. Ramezani A. Hawley R.G. McCaffrey T.A. J. Vasc. Res. 2007; 44: 483-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Slides containing thin sections of paraffin-embedded human artery tissues with or without atherosclerotic lesions were obtained from carotid endarterectomy as waste surgical specimens under Institutional Review Board-approved protocols as previously described (31Gagarin D.

Antigen retrieval was performed by treating slides in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven followed by blocking the endogenous peroxidase activity by incubating slides with 1% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min. Slides were then treated with 10% normal goat serum in 1x PBS at room temperature for 60 min to block nonspecific binding. Subsequently, slides were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-ApoL6 (1:100 dilution) (37Liu Z. Lu H. Jiang Z. Pastuszyn A. Hu C.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar) or anti-caspase 3 (9661; Cell Signaling, 1:200 dilution) at 4 °C for overnight, washed three times with 1× PBS, incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody at room temperature for 60 min, and then incubated with avidin-biotinylated peroxidase complex (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector Laboratories) for 30 min followed by reacting with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for color development. α-Actin, a marker for smooth muscle cells, was used as a control. Images were observed using a Zeiss A1 microscope with a digital camera (Optronics 60806). Construction of adenovirus (AD) harboring full-length ApoL6 cDNA (AD.ApoL6) and infection of cells by viruses were performed as previously described (37Liu Z. Lu H. Jiang Z. Pastuszyn A. Hu C.A. Mol.

In one group, pan caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK, 50 μm; R&D Systems) was added 2 h prior and during viral infection for 48 h. Cell numbers and apoptosis were measured over time by cell counting, analysis of cell morphology, and assay of caspase activation as previously described (14Wan G. Zhaorigetu S. Liu Z. Kaini R.

To prepare total cellular extracts, cells were isolated and sonicated in RIPA solution (0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.14 m NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100). Protein concentrations were measured using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Proteins were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE (20–30 μg protein/lane) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) or polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) (Pierce), which were then incubated with indicated antibodies, such as polyclonal anti-ApoL6, polyclonal anti-activated caspase 9 (9501S; Cell Signaling), monoclonal anti-activated caspase 8 (9746; Cell Signaling), polyclonal anti-activated caspase 3 (9661; Cell Signaling), polyclonal anti-protein A (P3775; Sigma), monoclonal anti-Bcl-XL (2764; Cell Signaling), monoclonal α-tubulin (T9026, Sigma) and monoclonal anti-β-actin (AC-74; Sigma), anti-Beclin 1 (B6061; Sigma), and anti-p62 (610832; BD Transduction Laboratory). Subsequently, blots were incubated with goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse HRP-labeled secondary antibodies, as previously described (37Liu Z. Lu H. Jiang Z. Pastuszyn A. Hu C.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length cDNA of ApoL6 (37Liu Z. Lu H. Jiang Z. Pastuszyn A. Hu C.A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2005; 3: 21-31PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the XhoI (5′) and EcoR I (3′) sites of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). The in-frame fusion construct, pApoL6-EGFP, was confirmed by sequencing. Transient co-transfection of LDCs was carried out using a 1:1 mixture of pApoL6-EGFP and pmcherry-LC3 (39Pankiv S. Clausen T.H. Lamark T. Brech A. Bruun J.A. Outzen H. Øvervatn A. Bjørkøy G. Johansen T. J. Biol.

Lu H. Shi H. Du Y. Yu J. Gu S. Chen X. Liu K.J. Hu C.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). siRNA treatment: Both siControl (cyclophilin B) and OnTarget siApoL6 Smart Pool, containing 4 target sequences, were purchased from Dharmacon. Cells were seeded in 24-well plate (50,000 cells/well). The transfection was performed the next day after seeding in 2% FBS media with siControl or siApoL6 diluted in antibiotic-free medium using the DharmaFECT transfection reagent. siRNA was added to respective wells to a final dose of 10 nm. Media were changed the next day after siRNA transfection, and cells allowed to recover. The next morning, cells were treated with recombinant human IFNγ (R&D Systems, 5 ng/50 IU/ml) in 1% FBS media, and 8 h later the sensitivity to apoptosis was examined by determining survival after challenge with a Fas-activating IgM (clone CH11; Upstate Biotechnology) (10 or 25 ng/ml). 20 h later, MTT was added for 4 h, the stained cells were dissolved in DMSO, and the level of reduced MTT was measured by absorbance at 540 nm in a plate reader (34Yang Z. Gagarin D. St Laurent 3rd, G. Hammell N. Toma I. Hu C.A. Iwasa A. McCaffrey T.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2009; 29: 1213-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The efficiency of target silencing was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) mRNA expression level and/or Western blot analysis with anti-ApoL6 antibody. LDCs were grown on glass coverslips, treated as indicated, fixed in 4% (v/v) PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde solution and subjected to fluorescent microscopic analysis as described (14Wan G.

Chen X. Liu K.J. Hu C.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Two methods were used to assay ROS generation in cells using the fluorescence dye DHE (dihydroethidium; Sigma) (38Liu Z. Lu H. Shi H. Du Y. Yu J. Gu S. Chen X. Liu K.J. Hu C.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 40Donald S.P. Sun X.Y. Hu C.A. Yu J. Mei J.M. Valle D. Phang J.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1810-1815PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, LDCs were plated on a glass slip in 6-well plates in medium, infected with indicated virus (AD or AD.ApoL6), with or without 1 μm DPI (diphenylene iodonium; Sigma). After infection for 24 and 30 h, DHE was added to the cell culture (final concentration 2 μm), incubated for an additional 30 min, and washed twice with PBS. For image analysis, fixed cells on coverslips were mounted on glass slides and observed under a fluorescence microscope. For fluorescence quantitative analysis, cells were trypsinized from coverslips, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, fixed and then analyzed using a FACScan flow cytometer (Beckon Dickinson; excitation 248 nm, emission 585 nm) as described (38Liu Z. Lu H. Shi H. Du Y. Yu J. Gu S. Chen X. Liu K.J. Hu C.A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To monitor blockage of autophagy flux, LDCs were infected with AD or AD.ApoL6 for 24, 36, and 48 h, stained with monodansylcadaverine (MDC; 50 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed four times with PBS, and followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cell images were taken and acidic autophagic vesicles/compartments labeled with MDC in cells were counted by a Zeiss AxioScope A1 epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc.). To identify ApoL6-binding protein(s), LDC.2 cells were infected with AD or AD.ApoL6 for 30 h and then total protein extracts were prepared. For sample pre-clearing, protein extracts were first incubated with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads (sc-2001; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) on ice for 1 h. Anti-ApoL6 antibody was then added to the pre-treated and incubated at 4 °C overnight. 50 μl of protein A beads were added to the mixture and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, beads were washed 10 times in cold RIPA buffer and resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equal amounts (20 μg) of protein samples from the eluted and unbound/wash-through were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. LDCs cultured on coverslips were infected with AD or AD.ApoL6 for 30 h, fixed, embedded, and then ultra-thin sectioned for TEM analysis. Images were examined, captured and processed using an Hitachi H-7500 EM, AMT XR60B camera and associated software (v.5.42) as previously described (14Wan G. Zhaorigetu S. Liu Z. Kaini R. Jiang Z.

High-magnification pictures of TEM images were used to count and calculate AVs per cross-sectioned cell by two independent investigators. At least 200 cells were counted from each group. Triple biological and experimental replicates were used for statistical analysis. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparison between experimental groups was made using Student's t test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In a systematic identification of candidate genes important in IFNγ sensitized, Fas-induced apoptosis in LDCs, our prior study suggested that ApoL6 was one of the up-regulated, downstream effectors of IFNγ in LDCs apoptosis (26Chipuk J.E.

To confirm and extend this observation at the protein level and other cell-types, two LDC lines, LDC.1 and LDC.2, and HUVECs, a widely used model for endothelial cells, were treated with IFNγ.

https://openalex.org/W2164053775,"WW-binding protein 2 (WBP2) has been demonstrated in different studies to be a tyrosine kinase substrate, to activate estrogen receptor a (ERα)/progesterone receptor (PR) transcription, and to play a role in breast cancer. However, the role of WBP2 tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating ERα function and breast cancer biology is unknown. Here, we established WBP2 as a tyrosine phosphorylation target of estrogen signaling via EGFR crosstalk. Using dominant-negative, constitutively active mutants, RNAi, and pharmacological studies, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of WBP2 at Tyr192 and Tyr231 could be regulated by c-Src and c-Yes kinases. We further showed that abrogating WBP2 phosphorylation impaired >60% of ERα reporter activity, putatively by blocking nuclear entry of WBP2 and its interaction with ERα. Compared to vector control, overexpression of WBP2 and its phospho-mimic mutant in MCF7 cells resulted in larger tumors in mice, induced loss of cell-cell adhesion, and enhanced cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, and invasion in both estrogen-dependent and -independent manners, events of which could be substantially abolished by overexpression of the phosphorylation-defective mutant. Hormone independence of cells expressing WBP2 phospho-mimic mutant was associated with heightened ERα and Wnt reporter activities. Wnt/β-catenin inhibitor FH535 blocked phospho-WBP2-mediated cancer cell growth more pronouncedly than tamoxifen and fulvestrant, in part by reducing the expression of ERα. Wnt pathway is likely to be a critical component in WBP2-mediated breast cancer biology.—Lim, S. K., Orhant-Prioux, M., Toy, W., Tan, K. Y., Lim, Y. P.

https://openalex.org/W2046421793,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. Two promoters, 1A and 1B, have been recognized in APC, and 1B is thought to have a minor role in the regulation of the gene. We have identified a novel deletion encompassing half of this promoter in the largest family (Family 1) of the Swedish Polyposis Registry. The mutation leads to an imbalance in allele-specific expression of APC, and transcription from promoter 1B was highly impaired in both normal colorectal mucosa and blood from mutation carriers. To establish the significance of promoter 1B in normal colorectal mucosa (from controls), expression levels of specific transcripts from each of the promoters, 1A and 1B, were examined, and the expression from 1B was significantly higher compared with 1A. Significant amounts of transcripts generated from promoter 1B were also determined in a panel of 20 various normal tissues examined. In FAP-related tumors, the APC germline mutation is proposed to dictate the second hit. Mutations leaving two or three out of seven 20-amino-acid repeats in the central domain of APC intact seem to be required for tumorigenesis. We examined adenomas from mutation carriers in Family 1 for second hits in the entire gene without any findings, however, loss of the residual expression of the deleterious allele was observed. Three major conclusions of significant importance in relation to the function of APC can be drawn from this study; (i) germline inactivation of promoter 1B is disease causing in FAP; (ii) expression of transcripts from promoter 1B is generated at considerable higher levels compared with 1A, demonstrating a hitherto unknown importance of 1B; (iii) adenoma formation in FAP, caused by impaired function of promoter 1B, does not require homozygous inactivation of APC allowing for alternative genetic models as basis for adenoma formation."
https://openalex.org/W2047703873,"Angiogenesis inhibiting agents are currently integral component of anticancer therapy. However, tumors, initially responsive to anti-angiogenic drugs or vascular targeting agents, can acquire resistance. The limited clinical efficacy might result from the heterogeneous nature of tumors or alternatively from the unique phenotype of tumor vascular cells, widely diverse from so-called ‘normal’ endothelium. Hence, defining the molecular mechanisms driving this diversity might provide a rational basis to design combinatory therapies that should be more effective in avoiding resistance. Herein, we demonstrated that tumor-derived endothelial cells (TECs) isolated from breast and kidney carcinomas retained an endothelial phenotype, but outspread independently of growth factors. Applying small interfering RNA approach, we demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-3, but not vascular endothelial growth factor, released by TECs, supports their autocrine growth and promotes in vivo vessel formation and tumor angiogenesis. Meanwhile, we found that the expression of the membrane-bound kit ligand (mbKitL) depends on IL-3, and it is crucial for adhesion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and inflammatory cells to TECs. These events required Akt activation. Finally, the finding that depletion of the mbKitL prevented EPC and inflammatory cell trafficking into vascular microenvironment, indicates that, as in bone marrow, the mbKitL can act as a membrane/adhesion molecule for c-Kit-expressing cells. These data provide evidences that an IL-3 autocrine loop can drive a tumor endothelial switch and that targeting IL-3 might confer a significant therapeutic advantage to hamper tumor angiogenesis."

In this study, we investigated the expression of non-coding RNA upon viral infection or RLR activation. Using a microarray, we identified several microRNAs (miRNA) specifically induced to express by RLR signaling. As suggested by Bioinformatics (miRBase Target Data base), one of the RLR-inducible miRNAs, miR-23b, actually knocked down the expression of very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and LDLR-related protein 5 (LRP5). Transfection of miR-23b specifically inhibited infection of rhinovirus 1B (RV1B), which utilizes the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family for viral entry. Conversely, introduction of anti-miRNA-23b enhanced the viral yield. Knockdown experiments using small interfering RNA (siRNA) revealed that VLDLR, but not LRP5, is critical for an efficient infection by RV1B. Furthermore, experiments with the transfection of infectious viral RNA revealed that miR-23b did not affect post-entry viral replication.

https://openalex.org/W2041824736,"Pdcd4 is a novel tumor suppressor protein that functions in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and appears to be involved in the regulation of transcription and translation. In the cytoplasm, Pdcd4 has been implicated in the suppression of translation of mRNAs containing structured 5′-untranslated regions; however, the mechanisms that recruit Pdcd4 to specific target mRNAs and the identities of these mRNAs are mostly unknown. In this study, we have identified c-myb mRNA as the first natural translational target mRNA of Pdcd4. We have found that translational suppression of c-myb mRNA by Pdcd4 is dependent on sequences located within the c-myb-coding region. Furthermore, we have found that the N-terminal domain of Pdcd4 has an important role in targeting Pdcd4 to c-myb RNA by mediating preferential RNA binding to the Pdcd4-responsive region of c-myb mRNA. Overall, our work demonstrates for the first time that Pdcd4 is directly involved in translational suppression of a natural mRNA and provides the first evidence for a key role of the RNA-binding domain in targeting Pdcd4 to a specific mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W2008608440,"The copper-transporting ATPase ATP7A has an essential role in human physiology. ATP7A transfers the copper cofactor to metalloenzymes within the secretory pathway; inactivation of ATP7A results in an untreatable neurodegenerative disorder, Menkes disease. Presently, the mechanism of ATP7A-mediated copper release into the secretory pathway is not understood. We demonstrate that the characteristic His/Met-rich segment Met(672)-Pro(707) (HM-loop) that connects the first two transmembrane segments of ATP7A is important for copper release. Mutations within this loop do not prevent the ability of ATP7A to form a phosphorylated intermediate during ATP hydrolysis but inhibit subsequent dephosphorylation, a step associated with copper release. The HM-loop inserted into a scaffold protein forms two structurally distinct binding sites and coordinates copper in a mixed His-Met environment with an ∼2:1 stoichiometry. Binding of either copper or silver, a Cu(I) analog, induces structural changes in the loop. Mutations of 4 Met residues to Ile or two His-His pairs to Ala-Gly decrease affinity for copper. Altogether, the data suggest a two-step process, where copper released from the transport sites binds to the first His(Met)(2) site, triggering a structural change and binding to a second 2-coordinate His-His or His-Met site. We also show that copper binding within the HM-loop stabilizes Cu(I) and protects it from oxidation, which may further aid the transfer of copper from ATP7A to acceptor proteins. The mechanism of copper entry into the secretory pathway is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2034690180,"Specific regulation of target genes by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) in a given cellular context is determined in part by transcription factors and cofactors that interact with the Smad complex. In this study, we determined Smad2 and Smad3 (Smad2/3) binding regions in the promoters of known genes in HepG2 hepatoblastoma cells, and we compared them with those in HaCaT epidermal keratinocytes to elucidate the mechanisms of cell type- and context-dependent regulation of transcription induced by TGF-β. Our results show that 81% of the Smad2/3 binding regions in HepG2 cells were not shared with those found in HaCaT cells. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) is expressed in HepG2 cells but not in HaCaT cells, and the HNF4α-binding motif was identified as an enriched motif in the HepG2-specific Smad2/3 binding regions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of HNF4α binding regions under TGF-β stimulation revealed that 32.5% of the Smad2/3 binding regions overlapped HNF4α bindings. MIXL1 was identified as a new combinatorial target of HNF4α and Smad2/3, and both the HNF4α protein and its binding motif were required for the induction of MIXL1 by TGF-β in HepG2 cells. These findings generalize the importance of binding of HNF4α on Smad2/3 binding genomic regions for HepG2-specific regulation of transcription by TGF-β and suggest that certain transcription factors expressed in a cell type-specific manner play important roles in the transcription regulated by the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2060542650,"HAMLET is the first member of a new family of tumoricidal protein-lipid complexes that kill cancer cells broadly, while sparing healthy, differentiated cells. Many and diverse tumor cell types are sensitive to the lethal effect, suggesting that HAMLET identifies and activates conserved death pathways in cancer cells. Here, we investigated the molecular basis for the difference in sensitivity between cancer cells and healthy cells. Using a combination of small-hairpin RNA (shRNA) inhibition, proteomic and metabolomic technology, we identified the c-Myc oncogene as one essential determinant of HAMLET sensitivity. Increased c-Myc expression levels promoted sensitivity to HAMLET and shRNA knockdown of c-Myc suppressed the lethal response, suggesting that oncogenic transformation with c-Myc creates a HAMLET-sensitive phenotype. Furthermore, HAMLET sensitivity was modified by the glycolytic state of tumor cells. Glucose deprivation sensitized tumor cells to HAMLET-induced cell death and in the shRNA screen, hexokinase 1 (HK1), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 1 and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α modified HAMLET sensitivity. HK1 was shown to bind HAMLET in a protein array containing ∼8000 targets, and HK activity decreased within 15 min of HAMLET treatment, before morphological signs of tumor cell death. In parallel, HAMLET triggered rapid metabolic paralysis in carcinoma cells. Tumor cells were also shown to contain large amounts of oleic acid and its derivatives already after 15 min. The results identify HAMLET as a novel anti-cancer agent that kills tumor cells by exploiting unifying features of cancer cells such as oncogene addiction or the Warburg effect."
https://openalex.org/W2060446731,"Telomere maintenance is essential for cancer growth. Induction of telomere dysfunction, for example, by inhibition of telomeric proteins or telomerase, has been shown to strongly enhance cancer cells’ sensitivity to chemotherapies. However, it is not clear whether modulations of telomere maintenance constitute cancer cellular responses to chemotherapies. Furthermore, the manner in which anti-cancer drugs affect telomere function remains unknown. In this study, we show that anthracyclines, a class of anti-cancer drugs widely used in clinical cancer treatments, have an active role in triggering telomere dysfunction specifically in telomerase-positive cancer cells. Anthracyclines interrupt telomere maintenance by telomerase through the downregulation of PinX1, a protein factor responsible for targeting telomerase onto telomeres, thereby inhibiting telomerase association with telomeres. We further demonstrate that anthracyclines downregulate PinX1 by inducing this protein degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome-dependent pathway. Our data not only reveal a novel action for anthracyclines as telomerase functional inhibitors but also provide a clue for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs based on telomerase/telomere targeting, which is actively investigated by many current studies."
https://openalex.org/W2068125777,"Various types of post-translational modifications of the histone tails have been revealed, but a few modifications have been found within the histone core sequences. Histone core post-translational modifications have the potential to modulate nucleosome structure and DNA accessibility. Here, we studied the histone H2B core domain and found that phosphorylation of H2B serine 32 occurs in normal cycling and mitogen-stimulated cells. Notably, this phosphorylation is elevated in skin cancer cell lines and tissues compared with normal counterparts. The JB6 Cl41 mouse skin epidermal cell line is a well established model for tumor promoter-induced cell transformation and was used to study the function of H2B during EGF-induced carcinogenesis. Remarkably, cells overexpressing a nonphosphorylatable H2BS32A mutant exhibited suppressed growth and EGF-induced cell transformation, possibly because of decreased activation of activator protein-1, compared with control cells overexpressing wild type H2B. We identified ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2) as the kinase responsible for H2BS32 phosphorylation. Serum-starved JB6 cells contain very little endogenous H2BS32 phosphorylation, and EGF treatment induced this phosphorylation. The phosphorylation was attenuated in RSK2 knock-out MEFs and RSK2 knockdown JB6 cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate a novel role for H2B phosphorylation in cell transformation and show that H2BS32 phosphorylation is critical for controlling activator protein-1 activity, which is a major driver in cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2082508816,"Current theories suggest that mitotic checkpoint proteins are essential for proper cellular response to taxanes, a widely used family of chemotherapeutic compounds. We recently showed that absence or depletion of protein Daxx increases cellular taxol (paclitaxel) resistance—a common trait of patients diagnosed with several malignancies, including breast cancer. Further investigation of Daxx-mediated taxol response revealed that Daxx is important for the proper timing of mitosis progression and cyclin B stability. Daxx interacts with mitotic checkpoint protein RAS-association domain family protein 1 (Rassf1) and partially colocalizes with this protein during mitosis. Rassf1/Daxx depletion or expression of Daxx-binding domain of Rassf1 elevates cyclin B stability and increases taxol resistance in cells and mouse xenograft models. In breast cancer patients, we observed the inverse correlation between Daxx and clinical response to taxane-based chemotherapy. These data suggest that Daxx and Rassf1 define a mitotic stress checkpoint that enables cells to exit mitosis as micronucleated cells (and eventually die) when encountered with specific mitotic stress stimuli, including taxol. Surprisingly, depletion of Daxx or Rassf1 does not change the activity of E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promotion complex/C in in vitro settings, suggesting the necessity of mitotic cellular environment for proper activation of this checkpoint. Daxx and Rassf1 may become useful predictive markers for the proper selection of patients for taxane chemotherapy."

ΔNp63 is frequently overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and in some other epithelial tumours. This overexpression may contribute to tumour progression through dominant-negative effects on the transcriptionally active (TA) isoforms of the p53 family (TAp63, TAp73 and p53), as well as through independent mechanisms. However, the molecular basis of ΔNp63 overexpression is not fully understood. Here, we show that the expression of ΔNp63 is regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and SCC cell lines. This regulation operates in particular through TCF/LEF sites present in the P2 promoter of TP63. In addition, we show that ΔNp63 and β-catenin are frequently coexpressed and accumulated in oesophageal SCC, but not in HCC. These results suggest that activation of the β-catenin pathway may contribute to overexpression of ΔNp63 during tumour progression, in a cell type-specific manner."

A transgenic mouse expressing this mutation under the collagen α1(II) promoter has been generated to investigate the mechanisms responsible for this chondrodysplasia. We recently identified zinc finger protein 521 (Zfp521) as a downstream target gene of PTHrP signaling. Interestingly, loss of Zfp521 from chondrocytes leads to reduced cell proliferation and increased differentiation in the growth plate. Thus, we hypothesized that specifically ablating Zfp521 from Jansen chondrocytes could sufficiently rescue the chondrodysplasia phenotype. Our results show that Zfp521 expression is up-regulated in Jansen mouse growth plate chondrocytes and that PTHR1 is required for Zfp521 expression. Its ablation from Jansen chondrocytes restored normal cell differentiation, thus initiating chondrocyte apoptosis at the chondro-osseous junction, leading to partial rescue of endochondral bone formation shown by proper bone length. This study provides the first genetic evidence that Zfp521 is required downstream of PTHR1 signaling to act on chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and cell death.—Seriwatanachai, D., Densmore, M.

During apoptosis, however, HuR accumulates in the cytoplasm. This is due to the caspase-mediated cleavage of the cytoplasmic fraction of HuR. One of the cleavage fragments generated by this processing of HuR interacts with TRN2 and thus blocks the re-import of HuR into the nucleus.

An ILK interaction motif of 78 amino acids (amino acids 82–157) was identified in the N-terminus region of myopodin.

We found that lungs from patients with IPF expressed increased levels of pVHL in fibroblastic foci. Bleomycin treatment also induced pVHL in lung fibroblasts, but not in alveolar type II cells. Overexpression of pVHL increased lung fibroblast proliferation, protein abundance of fibronectin and collagen, and extracellular fibronectin. In addition, overexpression of pVHL induced expression of the α5 integrin subunit. Overexpression of pVHL did not alter hypoxia-inducible factor luciferase reporter activity and mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Fibroblasts overexpressing pVHL were more sensitive to RGD peptide-mediated reduction in proliferation. Activating α5 and β1 integrin increased proliferation of fibroblasts overexpressing pVHL and those cells were more resistant to the inhibition of α5 integrin. Overexpression of pVHL also increased activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Moreover, suppression of pVHL prevented TGF-β1-induced proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts.

Core histones provide the packaging proteins for DNA in eukaryotic cells. During the S phase when genomic DNA is duplicated, replication-coupled expression of histone genes provides new protein to assemble newly replicated DNA. Histone chaperones assist in the creation of new nucleosomes to maintain a stable, compacted, repressed state of chromatin. Within this context, regulatory proteins modulate chromatin environments to facilitate access to the DNA for gene transcription. The components and processes that allow RNA polymerases to transcribe a chromatin template, such as epigenetic modifications of DNA and histones, are being identified and intensely studied. The processes of nucleosome displacement from DNA by transcribing RNA polymerases and of nucleosome reassembly from available histones remain poorly understood.

Specialized chaperones such as HIRA and Daxx selectively bind these RI H3 proteins at a small region, residues 87–90, which is uniquely different between RI and RC forms (3Lewis P.W. Elsaesser S.J.

Outside of the S phase, the transcribed genes are only repackaged using new RI H3 proteins. The basis for this selectivity is found in one or more of the following reasons: outside of the S phase, RC H3 proteins are not synthesized, histone H3 molecules from displaced nucleosomes cannot be reused in nucleosome assembly, and transcription-associated chaperones like HIRA use only RI H3 sequence variants. replication-coupled acetylated lysine acid urea Triton quantitative reverse transcription replication-independent synthetic dextrose peptidyl-prolyl isomerase carboxin left border right border new main.

Cell Biol. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 7Thatcher T.H. MacGaffey J. Bowen J. Horowitz S. Shapiro D.L.

Evol. 1996; 43: 194-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In Tetrahymena with 2 RC and 2 RI loci, complete knock-out of both RC or both RI loci produces viable vegetative cells. In RC knockouts, replication results in dramatically reduced cell proliferation rates and hypoploidy, likely because of insufficient nucleosome formation using only RI H3 histone. Proficient growth required up-regulation of RI loci. Conversely, RI knockouts are viable but fail to produce viable spores (9Cui B. Liu Y. Gorovsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The validity of these results for animals or plants has not been confirmed. The sequence differences between the RC and RI H3 variants in Tetrahymena involve many more residues than the distinctive three to five that exist between animal and plant H3 variants. Ahmad and Henikoff (10Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) had suggested that the basidiomycete Cryptococcus might contain a replacement H3 variant. Genome sequencing of the related corn smut Ustilago maydis revealed that this haploid organism has two distinct H3 genes. One is paired with the single histone H4 gene, an organization often seen for RC histones, and the other one is a solitary gene, like animal H3.3, with a replacement-like variant sequence at residues 89 and 90 (11Kämper J.

Nature. 2006; 444: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). We have evaluated the expression and stability of the Ustilago histone H3 proteins. We have concluded that the solitary H3 gene indeed has all the functional characteristics of a replacement RI H3 variant and that the H4-paired H3 gene is an RC variant. The similarities of the Ustilago H3 variants in gene structural organization, in the differences of the polypeptides produced, in the selectivity of incorporation into replicative and transcription linked nucleosomes, and in protein stability with the RC and RI H3 variants in plants and in animals is remarkable. It provides insight in the conserved nature of nucleosome assembly processes because the RC-RI H3 divergences arose hundreds of millions of years apart, each time at the ancestral root of what have become broad clades of diverse, multicellular eukaryotes (6Waterborg J.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We have begun to exploit the possibilities for homologous gene replacement in U. maydis (12Brachmann A. König J. Julius C. Feldbrügge M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and complementation by plasmid-based histone H3 mutants to evaluate the contribution of these two H3 variants in nucleosome assembly during transcription and replication. The viability of strains with KO U1 or U2 loci, coding for the RI H3.1 and RC H3.2 variants, respectively, is reported. U. maydis 521, strain 9021 obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, MO) and defined as WT, was grown in synthetic dextrose (SD) medium (6.7 g of Difco yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Benton-Dickinson, Sparks, MI) with 20 g of glucose/liter) at 30 °C on 2% agar or in liquid culture at 150 rpm with typical experimental use at ∼107 cells/ml. Cell density was determined by hematocytometer counting. Stationary phase conditions developed for WT cells above 2 × 107 cells/ml in SD medium. Labeling in vivo with [3H]acetic acid (20 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) was performed at 4 mCi/liter for 5 min, unless specified otherwise, after 10 min of preincubation at 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma), added from 2 mg/ml stock in ethanol. Labeling with [4,5-3H]l-lysine (60 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedicals) was performed at 0.4 mCi/liter for 30 min, unless specified otherwise, and with [35S]l-methionine (540 Ci/mmol; MP Biomedicals) at 0.1 mCi/liter for 20 min. Cell cycle progression was arrested in the S phase by the addition of 10% (w/v) hydroxyurea to 1 mg/ml (13García-Muse T. Steinberg G. Pérez-Martín J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in 1-liter log cultures at 2.2 × 106 cells/ml for 90 min. The cells were released from the block by washing with preconditioned SD medium. Tritiated lysine (50 μCi) was added to each culture during the last 30 min prior to cell collection after the culture was concentrated to 250 ml by centrifugation (5 min, 800 × g). The distribution of cells across the G1, S, and G2/M phases was determined by flow cytometry as described (13García-Muse T. Steinberg G. Pérez-Martín J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) in a FACScalibur 877 (Benton-Dickinson) with ModFit LT (Verity Software) data analysis. Histones were extracted and purified from cell pellets essentially as described (14Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17157-17161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells from 0.25 to 2.0 liters of culture were collected by centrifugation (5 min, 800 × g) and resuspended into two to four pellet volumes of 40% GuCl in KPi (40% guanidine HCl, 0.05 m KH2PO4, 0.05 m K2HPO4, adjusted by KOH to pH 6.8, with 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The cells were sonicated on ice in aliquots of 15 ml for 5 min twice with a Branson Sonifier 400 with medium tip at 25% initial output with cooling break, which resulted in 90+ % cell breakage, clarified (10 min, 30,000 × g), incubated on ice for 15 min at 0.25 n HCl, clarified (30 min, 30,000 × g), diluted with 0.1 m KPi, pH 6.8, to the refractive index of 5% GuGl in KPi, adjusted to 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and incubated overnight under rocking with 1 ml of settled BioRex70 resin (200–400 mesh; Bio-Rad) per extract from 2 × 1010 cells, an experimentally optimized ratio for the Ustilago procedure. After repeated washing by 1 × g settling of the resin from 5% GuCl in KPi until the supernatant was clear, resin was placed in a small column and washed with 8 volumes of 5% GuCl in KPi, and histones were eluted by 10 volumes 40% GuCl in KPi. Histones were dialyzed in 3,500 molecular weight cut-off Spectra/Por 3 dialysis membranes (Spectrum Labs, Rancho Dominguez, CA) thrice against 100 volumes of 2.5% acetic acid with 1.4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and recovered by lyophylization. Histone H3 was purified by reversed phase HPLC on Zorbax Protein-Plus columns (0.4 × 25 cm, New England Nuclear) as described (14Waterborg J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17157-17161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude histones were dissolved in 0.25 ml of 8 m urea in 1 m acetic acid and injected in the column, equilibrated at 1 ml/min with 40% acetonitrile (Fisher) in 0.1% TFA (Sigma), washed for 2 min in this solvent, and eluted by a gradient from 40 to 55% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA over 45 min. The two histone H3 variants co-eluted 43 min after injection, as monitored by absorbance at 214 nm. They were identified by acid urea Triton (AUT) gel electrophoresis of lyophilized column fractions based on protein size and characteristic affinity for Triton X-100 (15Waterborg J.H. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 103-111Google Scholar, 16Waterborg J.H. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 113-123Google Scholar). Semi-preparative purification of histone H3 used Vydac C4 columns (214TP510, 1.0 × 25 cm; Grace, Deerfield, IL) with the same elution conditions at 3 ml/min. AUT gel electrophoresis was performed in 15- or 30-cm-long gels with Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad) at 6 mm, a concentration optimized for Ustilago histone H3 variant separation, as described (15Waterborg J.H. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 103-111Google Scholar, 16Waterborg J.H. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2002: 113-123Google Scholar). Proteins were quantitated by densitometry of gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and destained in 7% acetic acid, 20% methanol. Specific radioactivity was determined by densitometry of fluorographic exposures exactly as described (17Waterborg J.H. J. Biol.

Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) using 0.4–0.6 mm glass beads for cell breakage for 3 min in a Mini-Beadbeater-16 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Genomic DNA was digested with DNase I. The qRT-PCR procedure with separate cDNA synthesis step was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Superscript III Platinum two-step qRT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Invitrogen) in an Applied Biosystems 7500 thermal cycler (Invitrogen). Ustilago peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (ppi) (GenBank NW_101009, locus UM03726.1) was used as a constitutively expressed reference gene (19Flor-Parra I. Vranes M. Kämper J. Pérez-Martín J.

Primers used for the amplification of histone genes (see Fig. 1A) U1 (U1F and U1R), U2 (U2F and U2R), and H4 (H4F and H4R) and for the ppi gene (ppiF and ppiR) are listed in Table 1.

Cells (5 × 106), subcultured under continuous logarithmic growth in SD medium for at least 4 days, were collected at 105 cells/ml culture density by centrifugation for 5 min at 1100 × g, gently washed with 30 ml of SCS (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 1 m sorbitol), and resuspended in 1 ml SCS. Protoplasts were produced by adding 2 ml of 128 mg/ml Vinoflow FCE (Novo, Gusmer Enterprises, Mountainside, NJ) in SCS and gentle mixing for 10 min, with microscopic verification of protoplasting. Protoplasts were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 1100 × g, washed twice with 1 ml of SCS and once with 1 ml of STC (1 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm CaCl2), and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold STC. A mixture of 5 μl of transforming DNA at 1 mg/ml in STC and 1 μl of 15 mg/ml heparin (Sigma) in STC was added to protoplasts (106 in 0.05 ml) on ice and incubated for 10 min. A solution of 0.5 ml of 40% (w/v) PEG 4000 (Sigma) in STC was added and incubation on ice was continued for 15 min followed by the addition of 0.5 ml STC. Protoplasts were centrifuged for 5 min at 1100 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in 0.2 ml of STC. Aliquots (0.02 ml) were plated on 1% SD agar containing 1 m sorbitol and 2 μg/ml carboxin and grown at 30 °C. Transformants were collected after 4–5 days. Carboxin (CBX) (5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-1,4-oxathi-ine-3-carboxanilide; Vitavax) and CBX resistance plasmid pGR3 were kind gifts from S. Gold (Athens, GA). Used without linearization as a transformation reference, pGR3 yielded thousands of transformants per plate in this procedure. Genomic DNA was isolated by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (22Stewart Jr., C.N. Via L.E. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 748-750PubMed Google Scholar), as modified (23Pitkin J.W. Panaccione D.G. Walton J.D. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), by the addition of 1% cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 0.7 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol to pelleted cells, vigorous vortexing for 3 min with 0.4–0.6-mm glass beads, incubation for 45 min at 65 °C, the addition of 1 volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1, v/v), centrifugation for 5 min at 12,000 × g, DNA precipitation from the aqueous phase with 0.9 m ammonium acetate in 2-propanol, and a wash of the DNA with 70% ethanol. For the U1 KO construct, a 863-bp U1 left border (LB) sequence was amplified by PCR in a MJ Research PTC-225 PCR cycler (GMI, Ramsey, MN) using primer pair U1KOLBF and U1KOLBR, and a 1043-bp U1 right border (RB) sequence by primer pair U2KORBF and U2KORBR. The transformation construct was assembled by ligation of EcoRI- and SacI-digested plasmid pGEM-4Z (Promega, Madison, WI) to SacI- and SfiI-digested U1 LB, the CBX cassette excised by SfiI from pMF1-c (12Brachmann A. König J. Julius C. Feldbrügge M. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2004; 272: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), kindly provided by M. Feldbrügge (Düsseldorf, Germany), and the SfiI- and EcoRI-digested U1 RB. The construct was linearized by XbaI or SmaI for use in transformation through double-strand DNA repair-based homologous recombination (24Kojic M. Mao N. Zhou Q. Lisby M. Holloman W.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 67: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The equivalent U2 KO transformation construct was ligated using HindIII- and SalI-restricted pGEM-4Z, the SalI- and SfiI-digested 1020-bp U2 LB amplified by PCR primer pair U2KOLBF and U2KORBR, the CBX cassette excised by SfiI from pMF1-c, and the SfiI- and HindIII-digested 1015-bp U2 RB amplified by primer pair U2KORBF and U2KORBR and linearized by SacI for use in transformation. Constructs were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. CBX-resistant colonies were subcultured into liquid SD at 3 μg/ml carboxin. Genomic DNA was prepared, and homologous recombination at the targeted U1 and U2 loci was analyzed by PCR using a variety of primer pairs that uniquely recognized sequences within the transforming constructs, the carboxin resistance cassette, and sequences inside and beyond the border sequences. These primer sequences will be provided upon request. Two U1KO transformation experiments produced 65 CBX-resistant clones that grew in liquid SD and continued growth when selection was removed. Eight strains contained KO recombination events at the U1 locus and likely were heterokaryons. Clone 47 was identified as a homokaryon U1 knock-out containing the CBX cassette with error-free homologous recombination in LB and RB sequences, as confirmed by sequencing. Multiple confirmed U2 knock-out strains were obtained from recombinant heterokaryon strains that contained both wild-type and knocked out U2 loci in varying ratios, as measured by PCR analysis (data not shown). Continued culture under selection produced stable, slow growing homokaryon lines that subsequently could be maintained without carboxin selection and that contained only the CBX-interrupted U2 locus as verified by PCR analysis and sequencing. Transformed KO lines maintain viability when stored at −80 °C in 15% glycerol. Sequencing of the genome of the haploid basidiomycete U. maydis revealed the existence of two single-copy histone H3 genes (11Kämper J. Kahmann R. Bölker M. Ma L.J. Brefort T. Saville B.J. Banuett F.

These histone forms differ only in a few amino acids, including residues 89–90 (Fig. 1B). This region defines the replacement character of animal histone H3.3 (4Elsaesser S.J. Goldberg A.D.

Gorovsky M.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The characteristic sequence at residues 87–90 was the basis for the suggestion that the basidiomycete Cryptococcus might also contain this type of replacement histone H3 (10Ahmad K. Henikoff S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 1191-1200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). We chose to use U. maydis as the model system (29Steinberg G. Perez-Martin J. Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 61-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to evaluate the existence of a replacement histone H3 in basidiomycetes. We anticipated that the methionine-containing U2 gene, which shares its promoter region with the single histone H4 gene (Fig. 1), would be expressed in the S phase. BioRex70-based histone isolation from whole cells under denaturing conditions to preserve post-synthetic modifications and protein integrity was followed by reversed phase chromatography. The co-eluting histone H3 variants were separated by AUT gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2A) and named in order of increasing gel mobility H3.1 and H3.2, based on the standard method of core histone variant nomenclature (30Zweidler A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). [35S]Methionine labeling identified U2 as the gene that codes for histone variant H3.2 (Fig. 2B) based on the single methionine in the mature protein (Fig. 1B). This indirectly identified U1 as the gene that produces histone H3.1 (Fig. 1A). The relative amounts of the two histone H3 variants varied with culture conditions. Continuous subculture to maintain logarithmic growth resulted in cells with up to 80% of histone H3 in the H3.2 form (lanes A and C in Fig. 2C and lane 0 h in Fig. 3A). When cultures were allowed to reach near stationary phase (2 × 107 cells/ml), the relative amount of H3.1 protein increased to more than 30%, whereas continued culture into the full stationary phase, when cell budding ceases, cell walls thicken, and cell density stabilizes, produces cultures with up to 50% H3.1 protein (lane E in Fig. 2B and Fig. 3).
