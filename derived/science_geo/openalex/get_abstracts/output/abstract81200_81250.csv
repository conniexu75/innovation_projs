https://openalex.org/W2112400936,"Power spectrum analysis of heart rate fluctuations provides a quantitative noninvasive means of assessing the functioning of the short-term cardiovascular control systems. We show that sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous activity make frequency-specific contributions to the heart rate power spectrum, and that renin-angiotensin system activity strongly modulates the amplitude of the spectral peak located at 0.04 hertz. Our data therefore provide evidence that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in short-term cardiovascular control in the time scale of seconds to minutes."

The hybrid cells were treated with 5-azacytidine and tested for the reactivation and expression of human X-linked genes. The frequency of HPRT-positive clones after 5-azacytidine treatment was 1000-fold greater than that observed in untreated hybrid cells. Fourteen independent HPRT-positive clones were isolated and analyzed for the expression of human X markers. Isoelectric focusing showed that the HPRT expressed in these clones is human. One of the 14 clones expressed human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and another expressed human phosphoglycerate kinase. Since 5-azacytidine treatment results in hypomethylation of DNA, DNA methylation may be a mechanism of human X chromosome inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2049583947,"Addition of EGF to A431 cells at physiological concentrations causes a rapid three- to four-fold increase in the abundance of phosphotyrosine in cellular protein. The increase is essentially complete within 1 min and is maintained for several hours. No change in phosphotyrosine levels is found with fibroblast growth factor or insulin. Two phosphoproteins (molecular weights of 39 and 81 kd) containing phosphotyrosine appear de novo upon administration of EGF to A431 cells. The EGF receptor itself is a phosphoprotein containing phosphotyrosine as well as phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Changes in the phosphorylation pattern of the EGF receptor are seen upon treatment of A431 cells with EGF. Increased phosphorylation of tyrosine is the most rapid response of cells to EGF known, and may play an important role in the biological effects of EGF."

Among the homopolymers of the four common ribonucleotides, activated ribonuclease L degrades at an appreciable rate only polyuridylic acid.

Cell bodies containing the enzyme marker were located among clusters of cells that project via the first division. The existence of sensory pathways surrounding large cerebral arteries provides an important neuroanatomical explanation for the hemicranial distribution of headaches associated with certain strokes and migraine.
https://openalex.org/W1599070783,"Epidermal growth factor stimulates a cyclic AMP-independent protein kinase associated with membrane vesicles derived from human epidermoid carcinoma cells (Carpenter, G., King, L., Jr., and Cohen, S. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254,. 4884-4891). The kinase specifically phosphorylates tyrosyl residues in a Mr = 150,000 membrane protein (Ushiro, H., and Cohen, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8363-8365). We show that the reverse reaction, catalyzed by a phosphotyrosyl-protein phosphatase associated with the membrane, is inhibited by Zn2+. Dephosphorylation of phosphotyrosyl residues in the Mr = 150,000 protein is completely inhibited by Zn2+ at concentrations as low as 10 microM, whereas other divalent cations have no substantial effect. Inhibition of the phosphatase was reversed by EDTA and the activity in membrane preparations was increased by EDTA or fluoride, agents commonly thought to be phosphatase inhibitors. Acid hydrolysis of the membrane proteins followed by analysis of phosphoamino acids by two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that the phosphatase hydrolyzed phosphotyrosyl in preference to phosphoseryl residues. The specific inhibition of this phosphatase activity by low concentrations of Zn2+ may be indicative of the physiological importance of Zn2+ in the regulation of cellular phosphotyrosyl-protein levels."

https://openalex.org/W2035756674,"We have isolated genomic DNA clones from the newt Notophthalmus which contain one or more copies of a 222 bp tandemly repeated sequence (satellite 1). Satellite 1 occurs in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of all chromosomes and at the sphere loci of chromosomes 2 and 6. Lampbrush chromosome loops associated with the spheres contain transcripts of satellite 1, as shown by in situ hybridization. The matrix on these loops consists of multiple thin--thick transcription units, most but not all of which have the same polarity within a given loop. By in situ hybridization with single-stranded probes we show that transcription units of opposite morphological polarity contain transcripts of opposite strands of satellite 1. Satellite 1 occurs as the spacer between clusters of histone genes. We postulate that transcription initiates at a histone gene promoter, fails to terminate at the end of the gene and continues without interruption into the adjacent satellite DNA. In this way, long transcripts are produced which contain both histone and satellite 1 sequences. A general failure of termination signals might explain the unusually long transcripts of lampbrush chromosomes."

https://openalex.org/W2157108864,"The in vitro transcription of Xenopus 5S RNA genes and of deletion mutants of these genes has been quantitated by assays that measure the efficiency of transcription and the ability to compete with the transcription of a “wild-type” 5S RNA gene. The difference between the competition strength of one repeating unit of X. borealis somatic 5S DNA and its plasmid vector is fifteenfold. tRNA genes and the adenovirus VA RNA genes are weak competitors of 5S RNA synthesis (and vice versa). Deletion of the 5′ flanking region reduces the competition strength of somatic but not oocyte 5S DNA. Except for the influence of the flanking sequence, the regions within the 5S RNA gene that determine competition strength are those that have been shown to interact with a specific transcription factor that is required for accurate initiation of 5S RNA transcription. The major oocyte (Xlo) and trace oocyte (Xlt) 5S RNA genes from X. laevis are transcribed as efficiently as somatic 5S DNAs but compete only one fourth as well. This fourfold difference in the competition strength is due to oocyte-specific base changes within the intragenic control region."
https://openalex.org/W2012731204,"The modulation of cell metabolism by cell shape and external surface contact has been studied by suspension culture of anchorage-dependent fibroblasts. The suspended cells shut down protein synthesis and nuclear RNA metabolism and cease replicating DNA. However, these responses to suspension are lost or modified as cells become progressively transformed in behavior. We compare the metabolic consequences of suspension culture in five related types of fibroblasts: the well regulated mouse diploid fibroblast; the spontaneously immortalized and progressively less well regulated lines 3T3, 3T6 and HDP3T6; and the fully transformed anchorage-independent SVPy3T3. Protein synthesis is inhibited rapidly following suspension in diploid fibroblasts and more slowly in the less well regulated cells. In contrast, the response of hnRNA synthesis to suspension is lost completely when cells adopt the 3T6 phenotype, and message regulation is lost in HDP3T6. The prompt inhibition of ribosomal RNA precursor is modified to a slow decline in HDP3T6. The metabolism of fully transformed SVPy3T3 cells is indifferent to suspension. The progressive loss of shape-responsive controls may be related to tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W1595309264,"Chicken embryo fibroblasts infected with a strain of Rous sarcoma virus containing a temperature-sensitive mutation in the gene coding for pp60src, a protein kinase, undergo changes in collagen synthesis within 4 h after a temperature shift. Cells shifted from the restrictive to the permissive temperature for transformation show decreasing levels of collagen synthesis and increasing levels of kinase activity; the reverse occurs when infected cells are shifted from the permissive to the restrictive temperature. Levels of type I procollagen mRNAs coding for pro alpha 1 and pro alpha 2 chains, measured by hybridization to nick-translated cloned alpha 1 and alpha 2 cDNA, decreased simultaneously soon after a reduction in temperature and reached a new steady state at about 50 h after the shift. In order to test for regulation at the transcriptional level, nuclei were isolated from normal and Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts and allowed to transcribe in the presence of [alpha-32P]UTP. Procollagen mRNA sequences in newly synthesized and in total RNA from transformed cell preparations were both about 5-fold lower than the levels in normal cell preparations. We conclude that the coordinate decrease in procollagen mRNAs observed in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts is caused primarily by a decrease in the transcription of the type I procollagen genes, a decrease which is directly or indirectly mediated by the pp60src protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2060872330,"We have isolated and sequenced a genomic fragment containing sequences complementary to chicken U1 RNA. The sequence of this genomic U1 gene is completely homologous and colinear with that of chicken U1 RNA. This U1 gene is part of a multigene family (6–10 copies per haploid genome), and these loci do not appear to be closely clustered. Sequences complementary to other snRNAs are not present within the 2.5 kb genomic fragment containing the U1 gene. We have determined that U1 RNA is synthesized by polymerase II; however, a “Hogness box” is not present upstream from its cap site at the position usually observed for mRNA genes. The synthesis of U1 RNA in oviduct nuclei during different states of hormonal induction also appears to be constitutive."

https://openalex.org/W1965509347,"Incubation of rabbit alveolar macrophages in vitro with methyl amine led to a time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of uptake of alpha macroglobulin-125I-trypsin complexes (alpha M-125I-T). Upon addition of methyl amine (50 mM) to cells prelabeled with alpha M-125I-T there was a rapid inhibition of lysosomal catabolism of internalized ligand. In the absence of ligand, incubation of cells with 50 mM methyl amine led to a 40-70% decrease in surface-receptor number. The methyl amine-induced decrease in surface-receptor number only occurred in metabolically active cells since cells incubated at 0 degrees C, or treated with N-ethyl maleimide and incubated at 37 degrees C, did not show the effect. Incubation of cells at 37 degrees C with methyl amine also effected a 40-70% decrease in fluid-phase pinocytosis. Although there was a decline in surface-receptor number, the remaining population of receptors were capable of mediating (at least) one round of ligand internalization. However, further ligand uptake was prevented. Data demonstrate that although receptors were present on cell surfaces, they were incapable of mediating ligand internalization. Incubation of macrophages with chloroquine at 37 degrees C for 60 min also led to a disappearance of receptors, and a concomitant reduction in fluid-phase pinocytosis."

https://openalex.org/W1529011815,"Brief exposure of cultured chicken pectoralis muscle cells to ionomycin or A23187 selectively increases the rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine into an 80,000-dalton protein was also observed upon cell-free translation of poly(A)-enriched RNA isolated from ionomycin-treated, as compared with control, cultures. These observations suggest that ionomycin selectively increases the cellular concentration of mRNA, which codes for the 80,000-dalton protein. The effect is probably mediated through an increase in cytoplasmic [Ca2+] caused by the ionophore. A similar effect of ionomycin was observed in cultured fibroblasts, HeLa cells, mouse LSP cells, and monkey kidney CV1 cells."

Chemical analysis of the deacylated LPS (D-LPS) revealed that ester-linked fatty acids were removed while the amide-linked fatty acids remained intact. The neutral and amino sugar compositions for native LPS and D-LPS were identical within experimental error. Antigenic determinants for complement-dependent human opsonic antibody were retained under these deacylation conditions. To enhance its immunogenicity, D-LPS was covalently coupled to Pseudomonas pili and the 1,4-diaminobutyl derivatives of Pseudomonas exotoxin A and tetanus toxoid. Quantitative amino sugar analyses revealed that 2.6 and 3.2 mol of D-LPS were covalently bound to aminobutyl Pseudomonas exotoxin A and aminobutyl tetanus toxoid, respectively. Gel electrophoresis data indicated at least 1 mol of D-LPS covalently bound per pilus subunit protein. Initial immunologic data indicated that antibody against D-LPS could be induced when the D-LPS is covalently attached to protein carriers."
https://openalex.org/W1511356620,"Differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, induced by methylisobutylxanthine (MIX), dexamethasone (DEX), and insulin, produces cells with the morphological and biochemical characteristics of adipocytes. Poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activity in 3T3-L1 cells treated with MIX, DEX, and insulin underwent an abrupt decrease in activity, remained low for several hours, and then increased; this rise was delayed by readdition of MIX, DEX, and insulin. The drop of synthetase activity represents the earliest alteration of a specific enzyme yet detected during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 control cells do not exhibit changes in poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activity when treated with MIX, DEX, and insulin. The transient reduction in poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activity in 3T3-L1 cells occurred prior to the appearance of the adipocyte phenotype induced by the above agents and was not observed when preparations were assayed in the presence of DNase I. It is evident that poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase activity was masked following treatment with MIX, DEX, and insulin since the synthetase is sensitive to agents that affect the physical properties of DNA. This transient reduction in activity may be an early event in differentiation which reflects changes in chromatin structure."

https://openalex.org/W1497671774,"Poly(A) RNA prepared from anglerfish islets programs the synthesis in a wheat germ cell-free system of two proteins of Mr = 14,500 and Mr = 12,500 that are both immunoprecipitated by an antiserum prepared to pancreatic glucagon of Mr = 3,500 (29 amino acids). We provide evidence by cDNA hybridizations and nucleotide sequence analyses that these two proteins are precursors of glucagon and that they are encoded by separate genes. Two cloned recombinant cDNAs prepared from the islet mRNAs individually hybrid-selected mRNAs that directed the cell-free synthesis of each of the two glucagon-related proteins. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cDNA corresponding to the Mr = 14,500 protein revealed a coding sequence for a peptide of 29 amino acids flanked by Lys-Arg sequences typical of those found at the sites of post-translational cleavages of hormone precursors. Twenty of the 29 amino acids in the sequence are identical with those found in the sequence of mammalian pancreatic glucagon. The second of the two cDNAs completely hybrid-arrested the translation of the mRNA encoding the smaller glucagon precursor of Mr = 12,500 but had no effect on the translation of the mRNA encoding the Mr = 14,500 precursor. The cDNA corresponding to this Mr = 14,500 precursor hybridized to the DNA of bacterial colonies containing the cDNA for the Mr = 12,500 precursor. Thus, two separate but partially homologous mRNAs encode the two pre-proglucagons."
https://openalex.org/W2050802891,"Rapidly growing E. coli with two active genes (tufA, tufB) for elongation factor (EF) Tu contains three times as much EF-Tu (tuf) mRNA as EF-G (fus) mRNA on a molar basis, but about seven times as much EF-Tu as EF-G or ribosomes. The concentration and translational efficiency of fus (EF-G) mRNA is about that for ribosomal protein mRNAs. The high molar concentration of EF-Tu relative to EF-G or ribosomes is achieved in part by translating tuf mRNA more efficiently than these other mRNAs. In a tufA+ tufB-: : Mu strain, the tuf:fus mRNA ratio is 1, but the concentration of EF-Tu and tuf mRNA is the same as in the wild-type strain. Thus cells with only an active tufA gene increase the concentration but not the translational efficiency of tuf mRNA. In such cells the concentration of fus mRNA is almost three times that in the wild-type strain. Because the tufA gene is distal to but cotranscribed with the fus gene as part of the four gene str operon, the wild-type concentration of tuf mRNA in these tufB- cells must be produced by increasing the concentration of transcript corresponding to the entire str operon. Thus transcription of the tufA gene can only proceed from the str promoter. Extracts of the tufB- cells contain tuf transcripts that correspond not only in size to the entire 4.5 kb str operon, but also to the size (approximately 1 kb) of a tuf gene. Our evidence suggests that this 1 kb tuf transcript is derived by posttranscriptional modification of the primary str operon transcript and that this modification could in part explain the high translational efficiency of tuf mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1481074838,"The hydrodynamic shape and conformation of the 16 S ribosomal RNA in reconstitution buffer at both 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C were determined and compared with the corresponding properties of the 30 S ribosomal subunit at 4 degrees C in order to understand the role of the RNA molecule in the assembly of the 30 S subunit. At 4 degrees C, the 16 S rRNA has a sedimentation coefficient s020,w of 21.0 S, a diffusion coefficient D020,w of 1.72 X 10(-7) cm2/s, a frictional coefficient f/fmin of 2.37, and a hydrodynamic radius of 125 A. At 37 degrees C, the 16 S rRNA has a sedimentation coefficient s020,w of 18.4 S, a diffusion coefficient D020,w of 1.39 X 10(-7) cm2/s, a frictional coefficient f/fmin of 2.91, and a hydrodynamic radius of 153 A. At 4 degrees C, the 30 S subunit has a sedimentation coefficient s020,w of 31.8 S, a diffusion coefficient D020,w of 1.97 X 10(-7) cm2/s, a frictional coefficient f/fmin of 1.77, and a hydrodynamic radius of 109 A. These results suggested that the free RNA in solution at 4 degrees C is less folded than the RNA in the ribosomal subunit. At 37 degrees C, the free 16 S rRNA is unfolded when compared to the structure of the same RNA at 4 degrees C. This implies that the folding step accompanying the RI to RI transformation in the assembly process needs the presence of both the RNA and core proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1564297072,"We have investigated the carbamate equilibrium of human adult hemoglobin, human cord blood hemoglobin, methemoglobin, and carbamylated hemoglobin using a stopped flow, rapid reaction pH apparatus described previously. The carbamate formation of human adult hemoglobin at 37 degrees C and ionic strength 0.15 was measured at pH values ranging from 6.2 to 8.8 and at CO2 partial pressures between 15 and 140 Torr. From experiments with unmodified hemoglobin as well as with hemoglobin specifically carbamylated at the four NH2 termini, it was found that already at pH 8, the epsilon-amino groups contribute significantly to carbamate formation in addition to the alpha-amino groups. At pH 8.5, about 70% of the total carbamate is due to epsilon-amino groups. The carbamate formation of alpha- and epsilon-amino groups can be suppressed by complete carbamylation of the hemoglobin. The results obtained from human adult deoxy- and oxyhemoglobin were used to calculate the equilibrium constants governing carbamate formation of these hemoglobins: Kc, the carbamate equilibrium constant, Kz, the R-NH2 ionization constant, and n, the number of binding sites per hemoglobin tetramer. Accordingly, two types of alpha-amino groups, each comprising two groups per tetramer, participate in carbamate formation of deoxyhemoglobin, one of low CO2 affinity (pKc = 5.2; pKz = 7.1; n = 2) and one of high CO2 affinity (pKc = 4.4; pKz = 6.1; n = 2). The pKz values derived from carbamate measurements agree within experimental error with figures obtained by difference titration of unmodified and specifically carbamylated hemoglobin. In addition to the alpha-amino groups, 15 epsilon-amino groups with pKc = 5.0 and pKz = 9.8 form carbamate in deoxyhemoglobin. In oxyhemoglobin, the carbamate data could be fitted with only two similar alpha-amino groups per tetramer in addition to 15 epsilon-amino groups, the latter with pKc = 4.7 and pKz = 10.2. The difference titration of the alpha-amino groups of oxyhemoglobin showed abnormal titration behavior of the beta-chain alpha-NH2. The pKc and pKz values obtained for the epsilon-amino groups of unmodified hemoglobin also provide a good description of the carbamate formed by hemoglobin specifically carbamylated at the four alpha-amino groups. The oxylabile carbamate, according to these results and in agreement with earlier reports, is only formed by alpha-amino groups; it amounts to 0.18 mol/mol of hemoglobin monomer at physiological conditions of pH 7.2 and pCO2 = 40 Torr. The amount of CO2 bound by methemoglobin equals that of oxyhemoglobin. Experiments carried out in the presence of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate provided evidence for competitive binding of CO2 and diphosphoglycerate to adult and cord blood oxy- as well as deoxyhemoglobin, the sites of competition probably being alpha-amino groups."

https://openalex.org/W1570296955,"Previous studies of the adult rat cerebral cortex have shown that two of the small molecular weight RNAs, K and L, are primarily cytoplasmic in location and are present in significant quantities in the microsomal fraction. We have examined their appearance in microsomal preparations. The results demonstrate that both K and L are, in fact, associated with polyribosomes. In particular, it is shown that (i) K and L are present in both membrane-bound and free polysomes; (ii) removal of microsomal membranes with Triton X-100 does not alter their association with microsomal polysomes; (iii) all of the K and almost one-half of the L associated with rat liver polysomes are resistant to high salt washing; and (iv) K and L are present in rabbit reticulocyte-free polysome preparations. The protein synthesis inhibitors cycloheximide and aurintricarboxylic acid significantly alter the association of K and L with rabbit reticulocyte-free polysomes. It is concluded that K and L are transiently associated with polysomes during the process of protein synthesis."

Following digestion of the satellite with EndoR.Eco RI, the major 2.07-kilobase pair (kbp) basic repeating unit and a minor 4.14-kbp fragment were exposed to 254 nm light in the presence of silver ions, conditions which resulted in essentially irreversible denaturation of regions rich in adjacent pyrimidines by the formation of pyrimidine dimers. The positions and sizes of the denatured regions were determined in electron micrographs of partially denatured 2.07-kbp and 4.14-kbp fragments spread in the presence of formamide. After 15 min exposure to UV, 90% of the 2.07-kbp fragments had a denaturation bubble averaging 0.17 kbp centered around one-third (0.64 kbp) the total length; 20% exhibited another in the region from 1.8 kbp to 2.07 kbp. Similarly, about 90% of the 4.14-kbp fragments had denatured regions centered at 0.64 kbp and 2.75 kbp and 20% of the fragments had denaturation bubbles in regions centered at 1.92 kbp and 3.9 kbp. The positions of the denaturation bubbles in the 4.14-kbp fragments support restriction enzyme mapping evidence that it is a dimer of the 2.07-kbp fragment arranged head to tail. Sequencing data show that the predominant sequence of a 0.29-kbp region centered around 0.64 kbp in the basic repeat unit is 49% A + T and that 42% of the bases are adjacent TTs and CTs capable of dimerization under the conditions used."
https://openalex.org/W1601783213,"Abstract We have recently demonstrated that a cell-surface dicarboxylate-binding protein (DBP) is involved in the outer membrane dicarboxylate transport system in Escherichia coli K12. The present report deals with our findings relating to the mode of action of this protein, and the identity and properties of the outer membrane integral protein which is involved in the translocation of dicarboxylic acids across the hydrophobic regions of the outer membrane. By the use of a nonpenetrating succinate analogue, aspartate-dextran, and through reconstitution studies with purified DBP, the cell-surface DBP is found to play an important role in succinate influx but not efflux. Transport studies with major outer membrane protein mutants indicate that the matrix protein (also referred to as protein I or porin) is the only outer membrane integral protein actively involved in the outer membrane dicarboxylate transport system. In the absence of a functional DBP, porin translocates succinate in a relatively less efficient and nonspecific manner. A tentative working model is proposed for this transport system. In this model, the cell-surface DBP is depicted as the substrate recognition component of the otherwise nonspecific porin channel. Together, this DBP-porin channel complex forms an efficient, specific transport channel for dicarboxylic acids."
