https://openalex.org/W4290852063,"Computerized auscultation of lung sounds is gaining importance today with the availability of lung sounds and its potential in overcoming the limitations of traditional diagnosis methods for respiratory diseases. The publicly available ICBHI respiratory sounds database is severely imbalanced, making it difficult for a deep learning model to generalize and provide reliable results. This work aims to synthesize respiratory sounds of various categories using variants of Variational Autoencoders like Multilayer Perceptron VAE (MLP-VAE), Convolutional VAE (CVAE) Conditional VAE and compare the influence of augmenting the imbalanced dataset on the performance of various lung sound classification models. We evaluated the quality of the synthetic respiratory sounds’ quality using metrics such as Fréchet Audio Distance (FAD), Cross-Correlation and Mel Cepstral Distortion. Our results showed that MLP-VAE achieved an average FAD of 12.42 over all classes, whereas Convolutional VAE and Conditional CVAE achieved an average FAD of 11.58 and 11.64 for all classes, respectively. A significant improvement in the classification performance metrics was observed upon augmenting the imbalanced dataset for certain minority classes and marginal improvement for the other classes. Hence, our work shows that deep learning-based lung sound classification models are not only a promising solution over traditional methods but can also achieve a significant performance boost upon augmenting an imbalanced training set."
https://openalex.org/W4293374782,"Human innate immunity plays a critical role in tumor surveillance and in immunoregulation within the tumor microenvironment. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphoid cells that have opposing roles in the tumor microenvironment, including NK cell subsets that mediate tumor cell cytotoxicity and subsets with regulatory function that contribute to the tumor immune suppressive environment. The balance between effector and regulatory NK cell subsets has been studied extensively in murine models of cancer, but there is a paucity of models to study human NK cell function in tumorigenesis. Humanized mice are a powerful alternative to syngeneic mouse tumor models for the study of human immuno-oncology and have proven effective tools to test immunotherapies targeting T cells. However, human NK cell development and survival in humanized NOD-scid-IL2rgnull (NSG) mice are severely limited. To enhance NK cell development, we have developed NSG mice that constitutively expresses human Interleukin 15 (IL15), NSG-Tg(Hu-IL15). Following hematopoietic stem cell engraftment of NSG-Tg(Hu-IL15) mice, significantly higher levels of functional human CD56+ NK cells are detectable in blood and spleen, as compared to NSG mice. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-engrafted NSG-Tg(Hu-IL15) mice also supported the development of human CD3+ T cells, CD20+ B cells, and CD33+ myeloid cells. Moreover, the growth kinetics of a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) melanoma were significantly delayed in HSC-engrafted NSG-Tg(Hu-IL15) mice as compared to HSC-engrafted NSG mice demonstrating that human NK cells have a key role in limiting the tumor growth. Together, these data demonstrate that HSC-engrafted NSG-Tg(Hu-IL15) mice support enhanced development of functional human NK cells, which limit the growth of PDX tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4290851349,"A theory of chemical graphs is a part of mathematical chemistry concerned with the effects of connectedness in chemical graphs. Several researchers have studied the solutions of fractional differential equations using the concept of star graphs. They employed star graphs because their technique requires a central node with links to adjacent vertices but no edges between nodes. The purpose of this paper is to extend the method's range by introducing the concept of an octane graph, which is an essential organic compound having the formula C8H18. In this manner, we analyze a graph with vertices annotated by 0 or 1, which is influenced by the structure of the chemical substance octane, and formulate a fractional boundary value problem on each of the graph's edges. We use the Schaefer and Krasnoselskii fixed point theorems to investigate the existence of solutions to the presented boundary value problems in the framework of the Caputo fractional derivative. Finally, two examples are provided to highlight the importance of our results in this area of study."
https://openalex.org/W4290851888,"Introduction The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of early tocilizumab treatment for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. Methods Open-label randomized phase II clinical trial investigating tocilizumab in patients with proven COVID-19 admitted to the general ward and in need of supplemental oxygen. The primary endpoint of the study was 30-day mortality with a prespecified 2-sided significance level of α = 0.10. A post-hoc analysis was performed for a combined endpoint of mechanical ventilation or death at 30 days. Secondary objectives included comparing the duration of hospital stay, ICU admittance and duration of ICU stay and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Results A total of 354 patients (67% men; median age 66 years) were enrolled of whom 88% received dexamethasone. Thirty-day mortality was 19% (95% CI 14%-26%) in the standard arm versus 12% (95% CI: 8%-18%) in the tocilizumab arm, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.62 (90% CI 0.39–0.98; p = 0.086). 17% of patients were admitted to the ICU in each arm (p = 0.89). The median stay in the ICU was 14 days (IQR 9–28) in the standard arm versus 9 days (IQR 5–14) in the tocilizumab arm (p = 0.014). Mechanical ventilation or death at thirty days was 31% (95% CI 24%-38%) in the standard arm versus 21% (95% CI 16%-28%) in the tocilizumab arm, HR = 0.65 (95% CI 0.42–0.98; p = 0.042). Conclusions This randomized phase II study supports efficacy for tocilizumab when given early in the disease course in hospitalized patients who need oxygen support, especially when concomitantly treated with dexamethasone.

https://openalex.org/W4290851994,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by excessive accumulation of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, including tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs consist of a heterogeneous population with high plasticity and are associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Moreover, breast cancer cells can secrete factors that influence TAM polarization. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the crosstalk between cancer cells and macrophages in the context of TNBC. Cytokine-polarized M2 macrophage were used as control. Distinct from the classical M2 macrophage, TAMs generated from TNBC-conditioned media upregulated both M1- and M2-associated genes, and secreted both the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin IL-10 and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor- α. Theses TNBC-induced TAMs exert aggressive behavior of TNBC cells. Consistently, TCGA and MTABRIC analyses of human breast cancer revealed upregulation of M1- associated genes in TNBC comparing with non-TNBC. Among these M1-associated genes, CXCL10 and IL1B were revealed to be independent prognostic factors for disease progression. In conclusion, TNBC cells induce macrophage polarization with a mixture of M1 and M2 phenotypes. These cancer-induced TAMs further enhance tumor cell growth and aggressiveness."
https://openalex.org/W4290851352,"Background Effective postnatal care is important for optimal care of women and newborns–to promote health and wellbeing, identify and treat clinical and psychosocial concerns, and to provide support for families. Yet uptake of formal postnatal care services is low and inequitable in many countries. As part of a larger study examining the views of women, partners, and families requiring both routine and specialised care, we analysed a subset of data on the views and experiences of women related to routine postnatal care. Methods We undertook a qualitative evidence synthesis, using a framework analysis approach. We included studies published up to December 2019 with extractable qualitative data, with no language restriction. We focused on women in the general population and their accounts of routine postnatal care utilization. We searched MEDLINE, PUBMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, EBM-Reviews, and grey literature. Two reviewers screened each study independently; inclusion was agreed by consensus. Data abstraction and scientific quality assessment were carried out using a study-specific extraction form and established quality assessment tools. The analysis framework was developed a priori based on previous knowledge and research on the topic and adapted. Due to the number of included texts, the final synthesis was developed inductively from the initial framework by iterative sampling of the included studies, until data saturation was achieved. Findings are presented by high versus low/middle income country, and by confidence in the finding, applying the GRADE-CERQual approach. Findings Of 12,678 papers, 512 met the inclusion criteria; 59 articles were sampled for analysis. Five themes were identified: access and availability; physical and human resources; external influences; social norms; and experience of care. High confidence study findings included the perceived low value of postnatal care for healthy women and infants; concerns around access and quality of care; and women’s desire for more emotional and psychosocial support during the postnatal period. These findings highlight multiple missed opportunities for postnatal care promotion and ensuring continuity of care. Conclusions Factors that influence women’s utilization of postnatal care are interlinked, and include access, quality, and social norms. Many women recognised the specific challenges of the postnatal period and emphasised the need for emotional and psychosocial support in this time, in addition to clinical care. While this is likely a universal need, studies on mental health needs have predominantly been conducted in high-income settings. Postnatal care programmes and related research should consider these multiple drivers and multi-faceted needs, and the holistic postpartum needs of women and their families should be studied in a wider range of settings.

https://openalex.org/W4290851197,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is revolutionizing the monitoring of aquatic biodiversity. The use of eDNA has the potential to enable non-invasive, cost-effective, time-efficient and high-sensitivity monitoring of fish assemblages. Although the capacity of eDNA metabarcoding to describe fish assemblages is recognised, research efforts are still needed to better assess the spatial and temporal variability of the eDNA signal and to ultimately design an optimal sampling strategy for eDNA monitoring. In this context, we sampled three different lakes (a dam reservoir, a shallow eutrophic lake and a deep oligotrophic lake) every 6 weeks for 1 year. We performed four types of sampling for each lake (integrative sampling of sub-surface water along transects on the left shore, the right shore and above the deepest zone, and point sampling in deeper layers near the lake bottom) to explore the spatial variability of the eDNA signal at the lake scale over a period of 1 year. A metabarcoding approach was applied to analyse the 92 eDNA samples in order to obtain fish species inventories which were compared with traditional fish monitoring methods (standardized gillnet samplings). Several species known to be present in these lakes were only detected by eDNA, confirming the higher sensitivity of this technique in comparison with gillnetting. The eDNA signal varied spatially, with shoreline samples being richer in species than the other samples. Furthermore, deep-water samplings appeared to be non-relevant for regularly mixed lakes, where the eDNA signal was homogeneously distributed. These results also demonstrate a clear temporal variability of the eDNA signal that seems to be related to species phenology, with most of the species detected in spring during the spawning period on shores, but also a peak of detection in winter for salmonid and coregonid species during their reproduction period. These results contribute to our understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of eDNA in lakes and allow us to provide methodological recommendations regarding where and when to sample eDNA for fish monitoring in lakes."
https://openalex.org/W4290851966,"Available tests to detect clinically significant prostate cancer frequently lead to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Our study assessed the feasibility of combining a urinary biomarker-based risk score (SelectMDx ® ) and multiparametric MRI outcomes in order to identify patients with prostate cancer on prostate biopsy with increased accuracy and reliability. Samples of 74 men with suspicion of prostate cancer and available multiparametric MRI were analysed in a prospective cross-sectional study design. First-voided urine for determination of HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA levels was collected after digital rectal examination and prior to MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsy. All multiparametric MRI images were centrally reviewed by two experienced radiologists blinded for urine test results and biopsy outcome. The PI-RADS v2 was used. SelectMDx ® score, PI-RADS and Gleason Sore were obtained. Associations between Gleason Score, PI-RADS scores and SelectMDx ® were assessed using ANOVA and t-test. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed and evaluated as area-under-the-curve of the receiver operating characteristic. Upon biopsy, 59.5% of patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer, whereby 40.6% had high-grade prostate cancer (GS ≥ 7a). SelectMDx ® scores were significantly higher for patients with positive biopsy findings (49.07 ± 25.99% vs. 22.00 ± 26.43%; p &lt; 0.001). SelectMDx ® scores increased with higher PI-RADS scores. Combining SelectMDx ® , history of prior biopsy with benign histology and PI-RADS scores into a novel scoring system led to significant prostate cancer detection rates with tiered detection rate of 39%, 58%, 81% and 100% for Gleason grade group II, III, IV, and V, respectively. The area-under-the-curve for our novel sum score in receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.84. The synergistic combination of two non-invasive tests into a sum score with increased sensitivity may help avoiding unnecessary biopsies for initial prostate cancer diagnosis. For confirmation, further prospective studies with larger sample sizes and univariate and multivariate regression analyses and decision curve analyses are required."
https://openalex.org/W4293374765,"The mechanisms underlying acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression include interstitial inflammation, cellular senescence, and oxidative stress (OS). Although vanin-1 (VNN1) plays an important role in OS, its contribution to the AKI-CKD transition remains unknown. Here, we explored the roles and mechanisms of VNN1 in the progression of the AKI-CKD transition. We observed that VNN1 expression was upregulated after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and high VNN1 expression levels were associated with poor renal repair after I/R injury. In VNN1 knockout (KO) mice, recovery of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels after I/R injury was accelerated and renal fibrosis was inhibited after severe I/R injury. Furthermore, in VNN1 KO mice, senescence of renal tubular cells was inhibited after severe I/R injury, as assessed by P16 expression and SA-β-Gal assays. However, our results also revealed that VNN1 KO renal tubular cells did not resist senescence when OS was blocked. To elucidate the mechanism underlying VNN1-mediated regulation of senescence during the AKI-CKD transition, retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) was identified as a potential target. Our results suggest that the reduced senescence in VNN1 KO renal tubular cells was caused by suppressed RB1 expression and phosphorylation. Collectively, our results unveil a novel molecular mechanism by which VNN1 promotes AKI-CKD transition via inducing senescence of renal tubular cells by activating RB1 expression and phosphorylation after severe renal injury. The present study proposes a new strategy for designing therapies wherein VNN1 can be targeted to obstruct the AKI-CKD transition."
https://openalex.org/W4290851828,"Physicochemical conditions play a key role in the development of biofilm removal strategies. This study presents an integrated, double-layer, high-throughput microfluidic chip for real-time screening of the combined effect of antibiotic concentration and fluid shear stress (FSS) on biofilms. Biofilms of Escherichia coli LF82 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were tested against gentamicin and streptomycin to examine the time dependent effects of concentration and FSS on the integrity of the biofilm. A MatLab image analysis method was developed to measure the bacterial surface coverage and total fluorescent intensity of the biofilms before and after each treatment. The chip consists of two layers. The top layer contains the concentration gradient generator (CGG) capable of diluting the input drug linearly into four concentrations. The bottom layer contains four expanding FSS chambers imposing three different FSSs on cultured biofilms. As a result, 12 combinatorial states of concentration and FSS can be investigated on the biofilm simultaneously. Our proof-of-concept study revealed that the reduction of E. coli biofilms was directly dependent upon both antibacterial dose and shear intensity, whereas the P. aeruginosa biofilms were not impacted as significantly. This confirmed that the effectiveness of biofilm removal is dependent on bacterial species and the environment. Our experimental system could be used to investigate the physicochemical responses of other biofilms or to assess the effectiveness of biofilm removal methods."
https://openalex.org/W4290851839,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with chronic neurodegeneration often accompanied by elevated levels of the neurotoxic peptide amyloid-beta 1-42 (Aβ42) in the brain. Studies show that extracellular Aβ42 binds to various cell surface receptors including the human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and activates pathways of neurotoxicity leading to cell death. The α7 nAChR is thus considered a promising drug target for therapy against neurodegenerative disease such as AD. In this study, we use mass spectrometry-based label-free precursor ion quantification to identify proteins and pathways that are changed by a 72-hour treatment with Aβ42 or Aβ42 in the presence of the α7 nAChR blocker, α-bungarotoxin (Bgtx) in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Bioinformatic gene ontology enrichment analysis was used to identify and characterize proteins and pathways altered by Aβ42 presentation. The results support evidence on the involvement of mitochondrial proteins in Aβ42 responses and define potential mechanisms of α7 nAChR mediated amyloid toxicity. These findings can inform pharmacological strategies for drug design and treatment against amyloid disease."
https://openalex.org/W4290851286,"Introduction Ventilatory efficiency (V E /VCO 2 slope) has been shown superior to peak oxygen consumption (VO 2 ) for prediction of post-operative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing thoracotomy. V E /VCO 2 slope is determined by ventilatory drive and ventilation/perfusion mismatch whereas VO 2 is related to cardiac output and arteriovenous oxygen difference. We hypothesized pre-operative VO 2 predicts post-operative cardiovascular complications in patients undergoing lung resection. Methods Lung resection candidates from a published study were evaluated by post-hoc analysis. All of the patients underwent preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing. Post-operative cardiovascular complications were assessed during the first 30 post-operative days or hospital stay. One-way analysis of variance or the Kruskal–Wallis test, and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis and data summarized as median (IQR). Results Of 353 subjects, 30 (9%) developed pulmonary complications only (excluded from further analysis), while 78 subjects (22%) developed cardiovascular complications and were divided into two groups for analysis: cardiovascular only (n = 49) and cardiovascular with pulmonary complications (n = 29). Compared to patients without complications (n = 245), peak VO 2 was significantly lower in the cardiovascular with pulmonary complications group [19.9 ml/kg/min (16.5–25) vs. 16.3 ml/kg/min (15–20.3); P &lt;0.01] but not in the cardiovascular only complications group [19.9 ml/kg/min (16.5–25) vs 19.0 ml/kg/min (16–23.1); P = 0.18]. In contrast, V E /VCO 2 slope was significantly higher in both cardiovascular only [29 (25–33) vs. 31 (27–37); P = 0.05] and cardiovascular with pulmonary complication groups [29 (25–33) vs. 37 (34–42); P &lt;0.01)]. Logistic regression analysis showed V E /VCO 2 slope [OR = 1.06; 95%CI (1.01–1.11); P = 0.01; AUC = 0.74], but not peak VO 2 to be independently associated with post-operative cardiovascular complications. Conclusion V E /VCO 2 slope is superior to peak VO 2 for prediction of post-operative cardiovascular complications in lung resection candidates."
https://openalex.org/W4290851292,"The clinical presentations of COVID-19 may range from an asymptomatic or mild infection to a critical or fatal disease. Several host factors such as elderly age, male gender, and previous comorbidities seem to be involved in the most severe outcomes, but also an impaired immune response that causes a hyperinflammatory state but is unable to clear the infection. In order to get further understanding about this impaired immune response, we aimed to determine the association of specific HLA alleles with different clinical presentations of COVID-19. Therefore, we analyzed HLA Class I and II, as well as KIR gene sequences, in 72 individuals with Spanish Mediterranean Caucasian ethnicity who presented mild, severe, or critical COVID-19, according to their clinical characteristics and management. This cohort was recruited in Madrid (Spain) during the first and second pandemic waves between April and October 2020. There were no significant differences in HLA-A or HLA-B alleles among groups. However, despite the small sample size, we found that HLA-C alleles from group C1 HLA-C*08:02, -C*12:03, or -C*16:01 were more frequently associated in individuals with mild COVID-19 (43.8%) than in individuals with severe (8.3%; p = 0.0030; pc = 0.033) and critical (16.1%; p = 0.0014; pc = 0.0154) disease. C1 alleles are supposed to be highly efficient to present peptides to T cells, and HLA-C*12:03 may present a high number of verified epitopes from abundant SARS-CoV-2 proteins M, N, and S, thereby being allegedly able to trigger an efficient antiviral response. On the contrary, C2 alleles are usually poorly expressed on the cell surface due to low association with β2-microglobulin (β2M) and peptides, which may impede the adequate formation of stable HLA-C/β2M/peptide heterotrimers. Consequently, this pilot study described significant differences in the presence of specific HLA-C1 alleles in individuals with different clinical presentations of COVID-19, thereby suggesting that HLA haplotyping could be valuable to get further understanding in the underlying mechanisms of the impaired immune response during critical COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4290851691,"Praying mantids are important models for studying a wide range of chromosome behaviors, yet few species of mantids have been characterized chromosomally. Here we show that the praying mantid Hierodula membranacea has a chromosome number of 2n = 27, and X 1 X 1 X 2 X 2 (female): X 1 X 2 Y (male) sex determination. In male meiosis I, the X 1 , X 2 , and Y chromosomes of H . membranacea form a sex trivalent, with the Y chromosome associating with one spindle pole and the X 1 and X 2 chromosomes facing the opposite spindle pole. While it is possible that such a sex trivalent could experience different spindle forces on each side of the trivalent, in H . membranacea the sex trivalent aligns at the spindle equator with all of the autosomes, and then the sex chromosomes separate in anaphase I simultaneously with the autosomes. With this observation, H . membranacea can be used as a model system to study the balance of forces acting on a trivalent during meiosis I and analyze the functional importance of chromosome alignment in metaphase as a preparatory step for subsequent correct chromosome segregation."

Despite decades of effort, identifying the animal materials (donkeys, horses, cattle and pigs) in donkey-hide gelatin remains challenging. In our study, we aimed to identify marker peptides of donkey-hide gelatin and its adulterants and develop a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method to identify them. Theoretical marker peptides of four animals (donkeys, horses, cattle and pigs) were predicted and verified by proteomic experiments, and 12 species-specific marker peptides from donkey-hide gelatin and its adulterants were identified. One marker peptide for each gelatin was selected to develop the liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method. The applicability of the method was evaluated by investigating homemade mixed gelatin samples and commercial donkey-hide gelatin products. Using the liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method, the addition of cattle-hide gelatin and pig-hide gelatin to donkey-hide gelatin could be detected at a level of 0.1%. Horse-hide gelatin was detected when added at a level of 0.5%. Among 18 batches of donkey-hide gelatin products, nine were identified as authentic, and eight of the remaining samples were suspected to be adulterated with horse materials. These results provide both a practical method to control the quality of donkey-hide gelatin and a good reference for quality evaluations of other medicinal materials and foods containing protein components."
https://openalex.org/W4290851351,"Compressed fluorescence lifetime imaging (Compressed-FLIM) is a novel Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) method for single-shot widefield FLIM. This approach has the advantages of high temporal resolution and deep frame sequences, allowing for the analysis of FLIM signals that follow complex decay models. However, the precision of Compressed-FLIM is limited by reconstruction algorithms. To improve the reconstruction accuracy of Compressed-FLIM in dealing with large-scale FLIM problem, we developed a more effective combined prior model 3 DTG p V_net, based on the Plug and Play (PnP) framework. Extensive numerical simulations indicate the proposed method eliminates reconstruction artifacts caused by the Deep denoiser networks. Moreover, it improves the reconstructed accuracy by around 4dB (peak signal-to-noise ratio; PSNR) over the state-of-the-art TV+FFDNet in test data sets. We conducted the single-shot FLIM experiment with different Rhodamine reagents and the results show that in practice, the proposed algorithm has promising reconstruction performance and more negligible lifetime bias."
https://openalex.org/W4290851381,"Although there has been a range of studies that focused on physical frailty and associated fall outcomes within developed countries, similar studies from developing countries have been limited. This study aimed to examine the relationship between physical frailty and the prevalence of falls, multiple falls and fall-related injuries among the ageing population within the Indian context.Individual-level data from the first wave of the Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI) with 28,285 older adults aged 60 years and above (male 48.9%) was used for this study. Physical frailty was assessed through the physical frailty phenotype adapted from Fried's criteria. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to examine the association of frailty status with falls, multiple falls, and fall-related injuries among Indian older adults.The prevalence of frailty was found to be 29.94% within the sample and frail older adults had a higher prevalence of falls (15.43% vs 11.85%), multiple falls (7.73% vs 5.25%), and fall related injuries (6.68% vs 5.29%). The odds of falling among frail older adults were significantly higher in reference to the odds of falling among non-frail older adults [aOR: 1.24; CI: 1.09-1.41]. Similarly, the odds of multiple falls among frail older adults were significantly higher in reference to the odds of multiple falls among non-frail older adults [aOR: 1.24; CI: 1.05-1.48]. Moreover, the odds of fall-related injury among frail older adults were significantly higher in reference to the odds of fall-related injury among non-frail older adults [aOR: 1.21; CI: 1.01-1.45]. Falls, multiple falls and fall-related injuries were found to be significantly associated with employment and poor self-rated health, whereas, females and lone living older adults had a significantly higher likelihood of suffering from falls and multiple falls.Older individuals with physical frailty were found to be at increased risk of falls, multiple falls and fall-related injuries in India. The findings of our study also have important clinical implications in the measures undertaken to reduce falls and enable future healthcare practitioners and policymakers to factor in the key determinant of physical frailty."
https://openalex.org/W4290851384,"Beef meat production is the key to reducing poverty, achieving food security and nutrition, promoting exports, economic growth, and industrialization. Despite a large number of beef cattle, Tanzania continues to import beef meat and its contribution to GDP is low. Thus, this study used time-series panel data to analyze the beef meat industry in Tanzania from 1990 to 2019, with a particular focus on identifying the reasons and direction of the correlation between beef meat output and its determinants in the production processes. The study applied both descriptive statistics and the Cobb-Douglas production function model, using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) based estimator to analyze the data. Descriptive analyses revealed that Tanzania's beef meat production increased by 283,871 tons (59.3%-a positive trend) between 1990 and 2019. This increase was accompanied by approximately 29.75%, 53.05%, and 42.42% increases in beef cattle yield (carcass weight (hg) per head, beef cattle inventory, and the number of beef cattle slaughtered, respectively). However, the analysis further revealed that a 2.8% decrease in beef cattle extraction (low harvesting) rate due to low market participation, continues to be a critical barrier to increasing beef meat production in Tanzania. Furthermore, econometric estimates showed that the key factors that positively influenced beef meat output at a 5% significance level (P < 0.05) included beef cattle population (inventory), beef cattle yield (carcass weight (kg) per head, and the number of beef cattle slaughtered, with elasticity coefficients of 0.146, 0.469, and 0.564, respectively). While the number of beef cattle exported positively influenced beef meat production at the 10% significance level (P < 0.1) with an elasticity coefficient of 0.028. Surprisingly, invested credit to agriculture (farm credits) and imported pure-bred beef cattle had a negative impact on beef meat output but were statistically insignificant at P < 0.05. The results of this study have implications as to what factors need to be addressed to further improve beef meat production, thereby reducing its reliance on imports. We suggest that the Tanzania government and policymakers need to establish balanced policies for beef farmers and appropriately manage them so that beef meat development can be induced, contributing to poverty reduction, food security, and economic development."
https://openalex.org/W4290851737,"Protein S-palmitoylation, the addition of a long-chain fatty acid to target proteins, is among the most frequent reversible protein modifications in Metazoa, affecting subcellular protein localization, trafficking and protein-protein interactions. S-palmitoylated proteins are abundant in the neuronal system and are associated with neuronal diseases and cancer. Despite the importance of this post-translational modification, it has not been thoroughly studied in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster . Here we present the palmitoylome of Drosophila S2R+ cells, comprising 198 proteins, an estimated 3.5% of expressed genes in these cells. Comparison of orthologs between mammals and Drosophila suggests that S-palmitoylated proteins are more conserved between these distant phyla than non-S-palmitoylated proteins. To identify putative client proteins and interaction partners of the DHHC family of protein acyl-transferases (PATs) we established DHHC-BioID, a proximity biotinylation-based method. In S2R+ cells, ectopic expression of the DHHC-PAT dHip14-BioID in combination with Snap24 or an interaction-deficient Snap24-mutant as a negative control, resulted in biotinylation of Snap24 but not the Snap24-mutant. DHHC-BioID in S2R+ cells using 10 different DHHC-PATs as bait identified 520 putative DHHC-PAT interaction partners of which 48 were S-palmitoylated and are therefore putative DHHC-PAT client proteins. Comparison of putative client protein/DHHC-PAT combinations indicates that CG8314, CG5196, CG5880 and Patsas have a preference for transmembrane proteins, while S-palmitoylated proteins with the Hip14-interaction motif are most enriched by DHHC-BioID variants of approximated and dHip14. Finally, we show that BioID is active in larval and adult Drosophila and that dHip14-BioID rescues dHip14 mutant flies, indicating that DHHC-BioID is non-toxic. In summary we provide the first systematic analysis of a Drosophila palmitoylome. We show that DHHC-BioID is sensitive and specific enough to identify DHHC-PAT client proteins and provide DHHC-PAT assignment for ca. 25% of the S2R+ cell palmitoylome, providing a valuable resource. In addition, we establish DHHC-BioID as a useful concept for the identification of tissue-specific DHHC-PAT interactomes in Drosophila."

The test consists of disparity-defined letters embedded in random-dot stereograms. At each letter size, the letters are arranged in sets of trigrams like in the Pelli-Robson chart. The letter sizes correspond to SFs ranging from 0.3 to 2cpd. Within each triplet, all letters have the same disparity and the amount of disparity decreases after each set. Subjects report the letters verbally to determine the smallest disparity at each letter size. Twenty-four subjects were tested with eight different charts: crossed vs. uncrossed disparity at far and near, with two versions (different letter sequences). The disparity sensitivity function (DSF) had an inverted U-shape, with decreasing sensitivity for smaller stereo letters. The subjects had better stereopsis at far than near. All the subjects had lower stereo thresholds with crossed disparity than uncrossed, consistently at both distances. We found no effect of age or heterophoria on the DSF. The charts have good test-retest reliability (Pearson’s r = 0.89, p&lt;0.001) and are easy to perform. Our results with stereo letters as stimuli are comparable to results from studies using depth corrugations. This stereo acuity letter test permits assessment of stereopsis at different testing distances, directionality of disparity, and across a range of SFs, which can help diagnose selective stereo losses in binocular vision anomalies and monovision. Assessment of stereopsis at different SFs may provide additional information for understanding daily stereovision demands than the conventional tests."
https://openalex.org/W4290851837,"Background Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) has become a major public health challenge in developing countries including Ethiopia, especially among the underprivileged population. Ethiopia is among the developing countries with the highest burden of acute malnutrition among under-five children. Though, plenty of studies were done on the magnitude of acute malnutrition among under-five children in Ethiopia, there is a limited evidence on time to recovery from SAM and its predictors among children aged 6–59 months in Ethiopia, particularly in the study area. Objectives The study was aimed to assess the time to recovery from SAM and its predictors among children aged 6–59 months at Asosa general hospital (AGH), Benishangul Gumuz, Ethiopia. Methods A Five years retrospective follow-up study design was employed among 454 children admitted with SAM in AGH from January 2015 to December 2019. The data were extracted from the patient medical records using checklist. The data were coded and entered into Epi-Data 3.1; then exported to STATA/SE-14 for analysis. Proportional Cox regression was performed to identify predictors of recovery time. A proportional hazard assumption was checked. Variables with AHR at 95% CI and P-value less than 0.05 in the multivariable Cox proportional regression was considered as significant predictors of recovery time. Findings Among the 454 included records of children with SAM, 65.4% (95%CI: 50.1, 69.2) of them were recovered at the end of the follow-up with a median recovery time of 15 IQR(11–18)days. The incidence rate of recovery was 5.28 per 100 child days’ observations. Being HIV Negative (AHR = 2.19: 95% CI 1.28, 3.73), Marasmic (AHR = 1.69: 95% CI 1.18, 2.42), and marasmic-kwashiorkor child (AHR = 1.60: 95% CI (1.09, 2.37) independently predicted recovery time. Conclusions Though the time to recovery from severe acute malnutrition was in the acceptable range, the proportion of recovery was found to be low in the study area compared to sphere standard. The prognosis of children with severe acute malnutrition was determined by the HIV status of the child and the type of malnutrition experienced. Further strengthening of malnutrition therapeutic centers and routine checkup of the nutritional status of HIV positive children should be emphasized to reduce child mortality and morbidity from under-nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W4290851846,"Immunodeficient animals are valuable models for the engraftment of exogenous tissues; they are widely used in many fields, including the creation of humanized animal models, as well as regenerative medicine and oncology. Compared with mice, laboratory rats have a larger body size and can more easily undergo transplantation of various tissues and organs. Considering the absence of high-quality resources of immunodeficient rats, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to knock out the interleukin-2 receptor gamma chain gene (Il2rg) in F344/Jcl rats-alone or together with recombination activating gene 2 (Rag2)-to create a high-quality bioresource that researchers can freely use: severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) rats. We selected one founder rat with frame-shift mutations in both Il2rg (5-bp del) and Rag2 ([1-bp del+2-bp ins]/[7-bp del+2-bp ins]), then conducted mating to establish a line of immunodeficient rats. The immunodeficiency phenotype was preliminarily confirmed by the presence of severe thymic hypoplasia in Il2rg-single knockout (sKO) and Il2rg/Rag2-double knockout (dKO) rats. Assessment of blood cell counts in peripheral blood showed that the white blood cell count was significantly decreased in sKO and dKO rats, while the red blood cell count was unaffected. The decrease in white blood cell count was mainly caused by a decrease in lymphocytes. Furthermore, analyses of lymphocyte populations via flow cytometry showed that the numbers of B cells (CD3- CD45+) and natural killer cells (CD3- CD161+) were markedly reduced in both knockout rats. In contrast, T cells were markedly reduced but showed slightly different results between sKO and dKO rats. Notably, our immunodeficient rats do not exhibit growth retardation or gametogenesis defects. This high-quality SCID rat resource is now managed by the National BioResource Project in Japan. Our SCID rat model has been used in various research fields, demonstrating its importance as a bioresource."
https://openalex.org/W4290851938,"Pine wilt disease is a dangerous pine disease globally. We used Masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) clones, selected through traditional breeding and testing for 20 years, to study the molecular mechanism of their high resistance to pine wood nematodes (PWN, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus ). Nine strains of seedlings of genetically stable Masson pine screened from different families with high resistance to PWN were used. The same number of sensitive clones were used as susceptible controls. Total proteins were extracted for tandem mass tag (TMT) quantitative proteomic analysis. The key proteins were verified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). A threshold of upregulation greater than 1.3-fold or downregulation greater than 0.3-fold was considered significant in highly resistant strains versus sensitive strains. A total of 3491 proteins were identified from the seedling tissues, among which 2783 proteins contained quantitative information. A total of 42 proteins were upregulated and 96 proteins were downregulated in the resistant strains. Functional enrichment analysis found significant differences in the proteins with pectin esterase activity or peroxidase activity. The proteins participating in salicylic acid metabolism, antioxidant stress reaction, polysaccharide degradation, glucose acid ester sheath lipid biosynthesis, and the sugar glycosaminoglycan degradation pathway were also changed significantly. The PRM results showed that pectin acetyl esterase, carbonic anhydrase, peroxidase, and chitinase were significantly downregulated, while aspartic protease was significantly upregulated, which was consistent with the proteomic data. These results suggest that Masson pine can degrade nematode-related proteins by increasing protease to inhibit their infestation, and can enhance the resistance of Masson pine to PWN by downregulating carbon metabolism to limit the carbon available to PWN or for involvement in cell wall components or tissue softening. Most of the downregulated proteins are supposed to act as an alternative mechanism for latter enhancement after pathogen attacks. The highly resistant Masson pine, very likely, harbors multiple pathways, both passive and active, to defend against PWN infestation."
https://openalex.org/W4290851948,"European sea bass is a species of great commercial value for fisheries and aquaculture. Rising temperatures may jeopardize the performance and survival of the species across its distribution and farming range, making the investigation of its thermal responses highly relevant. In this article, the metabolic scope, performance, and tolerance of juvenile E. sea bass reared under three high water temperatures (24, 28, 33°C), for a period of three months was evaluated via analysis of selected growth performance and physiological indicators. Effects on molecular, hormonal, and biochemical variables were analyzed along with effects of acclimation temperature on the metabolic rate and Critical Thermal maximum (CTmax). Despite signs of thermal stress at 28°C indicated by high plasma cortisol and lactate levels as well as the upregulation of genes coding for Heat Shock Proteins (HSP), E. sea bass can maintain high performance at that temperature which is encouraging for the species culture in the context of a warming ocean. Critical survivability thresholds appear sharply close to 33°C, where the aerobic capacity declines and the overall performance diminishes. European sea bass demonstrates appreciable capacity to cope with acute thermal stress exhibiting CTmax as high as 40°C for fish acclimated at high temperatures, which may indicate resilience to future heatwaves events."
https://openalex.org/W4290851951,"The rise in antibiotic resistance has stimulated research into adjuvants that can improve the efficacy of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Lactoferrin is a candidate adjuvant; it is a multifunctional iron-binding protein with antimicrobial properties. It is known to show dose-dependent antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus through iron sequestration and repression of β-lactamase expression. However, S. aureus can extract iron from lactoferrin through siderophores for their growth, which confounds the resolution of lactoferrin's method of action. We measured the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for a range of lactoferrin/ β-lactam antibiotic dose combinations and observed that at low doses (< 0.39 μM), lactoferrin contributes to increased S. aureus growth, but at higher doses (> 6.25 μM), iron-depleted native lactoferrin reduced bacterial growth and reduced the MIC of the β-lactam-antibiotic cefazolin. This differential behaviour points to a bacterial population response to the lactoferrin/ β-lactam dose combination. Here, with the aid of a mathematical model, we show that lactoferrin stratifies the bacterial population, and the resulting population heterogeneity is at the basis of the dose dependent response seen. Further, lactoferrin disables a sub-population from β-lactam-induced production of β-lactamase, which when sufficiently large reduces the population's ability to recover after being treated by an antibiotic. Our analysis shows that an optimal dose of lactoferrin acts as a suitable adjuvant to eliminate S. aureus colonies using β-lactams, but sub-inhibitory doses of lactoferrin reduces the efficacy of β-lactams."
https://openalex.org/W4290851973,"Objectives To evaluate long-term outcome using the BioMedtrix™ TPLO Curve ® plate in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament disease (CrCLd) treated by tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO). Study design Retrospective case study. Animals Dogs (n = 323, 337 stifles). Methods Medical records were searched for dogs presented with CrCLd and treated by TPLO with the BioMedtrix™ TPLO Curve ® plate for 3.5 mm screws between March 2018 and December 2020. Tibial plateau angles (TPA) were measured on preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up radiographs. Changes in TPA between postoperative and follow-up radiographs (ModTPA) were calculated. Radiographic bone healing was scored. Complications were evaluated. Surgical site infections (SSI) were compared to a control group of dogs treated with the Synthes™ TPLO plate between January and December 2017. Owners of both groups were contacted by telephone at least 1 year postoperatively. Results The BioMedtrix™ group was composed of 237 dogs (248 stifles), the control group was composed of 86 dogs (89 stifles). In the BioMedtrix™ group, radiographic follow-up was performed at a median of 48 days. Average ModTPA was 1.2°. Bone healing was graded as complete, good, poor, and none in 18%, 62%, 20%, and 0%, respectively. At a median of 786 days postoperatively, minor and major postoperative complications were observed in 6 (2.4%) and 32 (12.9%) cases in this group, respectively. During the first year following the surgery, 23 (9.3%) and 12 (13.5%) cases suffered a SSI, of which 12 (4.8%) and 7 (7.9%) had their implant explanted in the BioMedtrix™ group and the control group, respectively. There was no significant difference between groups for SSI and implant explantations (p = 0.31 and p = 0.29, respectively). Conclusion The BioMedtrix™ TPLO Curve ® plate provided a reliable fixation system for osteotomy healing after TPLO. Bone healing and long-term complication rates were similar to previous studies using other implants. SSI rates were similar between the BioMedtrix™ group and the control group. The antimicrobial HyProtect ® coating of the plate did not reduce SSI in this study. Clinical significance The BioMedtrix™ TPLO Curve ® plate can be safely used for TPLO. The value of the antimicrobial HyProtect ® coating of the plate may be questioned, as SSI rate was not lower in this study compared to the control group or previous reports."
https://openalex.org/W4290851981,"Background Biodiversity data is crucial for sustainable development and making decisions regarding natural resources and its conservation. The study goal was to use quantitative ecological approaches to determine the species richness and diversity of wild flora and the ultimate impact of environmental factors on vegetation dynamics. Methods Quadrats having sizes of 1×1 for herbs, 5×5 for shrubs, and 10×10 m 2 for trees were used. Various phytosociological characteristics were investigated in association with a wide variety of environmental variables. Soil analysis based on texture, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM), available potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) were examined. The existing state of vegetation along the River Chenab was assessed using SWOT analysis and a future conservation strategy was devised. Results One hundred twenty different plant speies were divided into 51 families including 92 dicots, 17 monocots, 6 pteridophytes and 1 bryophyte species. Herbs accounted for 89 followed by shrubs (16 species) and trees (15 species). Correlation analysis revealed a highly positive correlation between relative density and relative frequency (0.956**). Shannon and Simpson’s diversity indices elaborated that site 3 and 7 with clay loamy soil had non-significant alpha diversity and varies from site to site. Diversity analysis showed that site 10 was most diverse (22.25) in terms of species richness. The principal coordinate analysis expressed that different environmental variables including OM, soil pH, P, K, and EC affect vegetation significantly, therefore, loamy soil showed presence and dispersal of more vegetation as compared to loam, sandy and sandy loam soils. Further, 170 ppm of available potassium had significant affect on plant diversity and distribution. Conclusion Asteraceae family was found dominant as dicot while poaceae among monocot. Adhatoda vasica was one of the unique species and found in Head Maralla site. For evenness, site 3 had maximum value 0.971. Most of the soil represented loamy soil texture where site 2 and 4 possess high soil moisture content. SWOT analysis revealed strengths as people prefered plants for medicine, food and economic purposes. In weakness, agricultural practices, soil erosion and flooding affected the vegetation. In opportunities, Forest and Irrigation Departments were planting plants for the restoration of ecosystem. Threats include anthropogenic activities overgrazing, urbanization and road infrastructure at Head Maralla, habitat fragmentation at Head Khanki, and extensive fish farming at Head Qadirabad. Future conservation efforts should be concentrated on SWOT analysis outcome in terms of stopping illegal consumption of natural resources, restoration of plant biodiversity through reforestation, designating protected areas and multiplying rare species locally."
https://openalex.org/W4293275808,"Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADO2) is a heritable bone disease of impaired osteoclastic bone resorption caused by missense mutations in the chloride channel 7 (CLCN7) gene. Clinical features of ADO2 include fractures, osteomyelitis of jaw, vision loss, and in severe cases, bone marrow failure. Currently, there is no effective therapy for ADO2, and patients usually receive symptomatic treatments. Theoretically, bone marrow transplantation (BMT), which is commonly used in recessive osteopetrosis, could be used to treat ADO2, although the frequency of complications related to BMT is quite high. We created an ADO2 knock-in (p.G213R mutation) mouse model on the 129 genetic background, and their phenotypes mimic the human disease of ADO2. To test whether BMT could restore osteoclast function and rescue the bone phenotypes in ADO2 mice, we transplanted bone marrow cells from 6-8 weeks old male WT donor mice into recipient female ADO2 mice. Also, to determine whether age at the time of transplant may play a role in transplant success, we performed BMT in young (12-week-old) and old (9-month-old) ADO2 mice. Our data indicate that ADO2 mice transplanted with WT marrow achieved more than 90% engraftment up to 6 months post-transplantation at both young and old ages. The in-vivo DXA data revealed that young ADO2 mice transplanted with WT marrow had significantly lower whole body and spine areal bone mineral density (aBMD) at month 6 post-transplantation compared to the ADO2 control mice. The old ADO2 mice also displayed significantly lower whole body, femur, and spine aBMD at months 4 and 5 post-transplantation compared to the age-matched control mice. The in-vivo micro-CT data showed that ADO2 experimental mice transplanted with WT marrow had significantly lower BV/TV at months 2 and 4 post-transplantation compared to the ADO2 control mice at a young age. In contrast, ADO2 control and experimental mice displayed similar BV/TV values for all post-transplantation time points at old age. In addition, serum CTX was significantly higher at month 2 post-transplantation in both young and old ADO2 experimental mice compared to the ADO2 control mice. Serum P1NP levels in young ADO2 experimental mice were significantly higher at baseline and month 2 post-transplantation compared to the ADO2 control mice. These data suggest that BMT may provide, at least, some beneficial effect at both young and adult ages."

All students in Doctor of General Medicine, Doctor of Preventive Medicine, and Bachelor of Nursing tracks at Hanoi Medical University (3672 students) were invited to participate. Data were collected using an online questionnaire including demographic characteristics, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 items, Patient Health Questionnaire 9 items, Fear of COVID-19 scale, and question about worsening mental health status. Robust Poisson regression was used to assess the association between mental health status and associated factors.Among 1583 students (43.1% response rate), the prevalence of students screened positive for anxiety disorder was 7.3%(95%C.I.:6.0-8.7), depression was 14.5%(95%C.I.:12.8-16.3), and perceiving worsening mental health was 6.9%(95%C.I.:5.7-8.3). In multivariable regression models, significant factors associated with self-reported anxiety disorder included being male (PR = 1.99,95%C.I.:1.35-2.92), difficulty in paying for healthcare services (PR = 2.05,95%C.I.:1.39-3.01), and high level of fear of COVID-19 (Q3:PR = 2.36,95%C.I.:1.38-4.02 and Q4:PR = 4.75,95%C.I.:2.65-8.49). Significant factors associated with self-reported depression were difficulty in paying for healthcare services (PR = 1.78,95%C.I.:1.37-2.30), and high level of fear of COVID-19 (Q3:PR = 1.41,95%C.I.:1.02-1.95 and Q4:PR = 2.23,95%C.I.:1.51-3.29). Significant factors associated with perceived worsening mental health status included having clinical experience (PR = 1.83,95%C.I.:1.17-2.88) and having atypical symptoms of COVID-19 (PR = 1.96,95%C.I.:1.31-2.94).The prevalence of self-reported depression, anxiety disorder, and worsening mental health among Vietnamese students during the first wave of COVID-19 was lower than in medical students in other countries.

https://openalex.org/W4290851362,"Background Tighter glycaemic targets may be of benefit for women with GDM and their infants. Barrier and enabler identification prior to implementation of tighter glycaemic targets for women with GDM may support a successful transition. Methods A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among Key Informant Health Professionals in ten hospitals in New Zealand. The survey assessed what was currently working using less tight glycaemic targets; what barriers and enablers were considered likely when introducing tighter glycaemic targets and whether these perceptions differed by health professional groups. Results Sixty Key Health Informant Health Professionals completed the survey. When using the lower glycaemic targets, participants considered that women with GDM found the targets easy to use and that collaborative collegial support was effective. No significant barriers were identified. Perceived enablers identified prior to implementation of tighter targets included receiving collegial support (40, 67%), attending education sessions (38, 63%), use of pocket prompt cards (31, 52%), availability of wall charts (25, 42%) and glycaemic target reminder stickers (24, 40%). For health professionals referring into the Diabetes in Pregnancy Service effective communication (50, 83%) was considered important. Perceived barriers were confusion over glycaemic targets use (27 (45%), not being informed of the glycaemic target change (31, 52%), non-involvement with multidisciplinary decisions (29, 48%) and increased difficulty of blood glucose control for women (48, 80%). Overall, barriers and enablers between Health Professional groups did not differ. Discussion Key Informant Health Professionals reported effective communication as a key perceived enabler and that woman would find it more difficult to control their blood glucose concentrations. Education sessions, multidisciplinary engagement, wall charts and stickers were considered effective to overcome the perceived barriers. Further research is needed to assess if the barriers perceived were realised and if the perceived enablers supported the implementation of the tighter glycaemic targets effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4290851394,"The COVID pandemic disrupted health care spending and utilization, and the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), Medicare’s largest value-based payment model with 11.2 million assigned beneficiaries, was no exception. Despite COVID, the 513 accountable care organizations (ACO) in MSSP returned a program record $1.9 billion in net savings to Medicare in 2020. To understand the extent of COVID’s impact on MSSP cost and quality, we describe how ACO spending changed in 2020 and further analyze changes in measured quality and utilization. We found that non-COVID per capita spending in MSSP fell by 8.3 percent from $11,496 to $10,537 (95% confidence interval(CI),-1,223.8 to-695.4, p&lt;0.001), driven by 14.6% and 7.5% reductions in per capita acute inpatient and outpatient spending, respectively. Utilization fell across inpatient, emergency, and outpatient settings. On quality metrics, preventive screening rates remained stable or improved, while control of diabetes and blood pressure worsened. Large reductions in non-COVID utilization helped ACOs succeed financially in 2020, but worsening chronic disease measures are concerning. The appropriateness of the benchmark methodology and exclusion of COVID-related spending, especially as the virus approaches endemicity, should be revisited to ensure bonus payments reflect advances in care delivery and health outcomes rather than COVID-related shifts in spending and utilization patterns."

For this purpose, abundant experimental data to train deep learning model is required. However, it is very difficult to obtain these data because the underwater experiment itself is very limited in terms of preparation time and resources. In this study, the image transformation model, Pix2Pix is utilized to generate data similar to experimental one obtained by our ROV named SPARUS between the pool and reservoir. These generated data are applied to train the other deep learning model, FCN for a pixel segmentation of images. The original sonar image and its mask image have to be prepared for all training data to train the image segmentation model and it takes a lot of effort to do it what if all training data are supposed to be real sonar images. Fortunately, this burden can be released here, for the pairs of mask image and synthesized sonar image are already consisted in the image transformation step. The validity of the proposed procedures is verified from the performance of the image segmentation result. In this study, when only real sonar images are used for training, the mean accuracy is 0.7525 and the mean IoU is 0.7275.

https://openalex.org/W4290851436,"High salt intake is positively linked to many health problems, but the effect of mineral-rich sea salt (SS) has rarely been studied. To better understand the physiological effects of SS intake, the changes in general characteristics, metabolites, steroid hormones, and gut microbiota of SS-fed rats were investigated. Male rats were fed either a normal diet (ND, control) or ND containing 1% SS or 4% SS for 5 weeks. SS intake decreased fat, spleen, liver, and body weight, and increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN), water intake, and gut salt content. Accumulated gut salt content led to a decrease in beneficial bacteria, such as Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillus, but an increase in potentially harmful bacteria, resulting in a change in lipid metabolites associated with gut health. Interestingly, most renal lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) associated with many renal functions were dramatically decreased and female hormones, such as estrogens, were significantly more altered than the male hormones by high SS intake. Although further investigation is needed, these data suggest that high SS intake could be positively linked to kidney dysfunction and gut health problems, and salt-related physiological changes may be sex-specific. Additionally, these data will be useful to better under-stand the physiological effects of SS intake."

Donor hearts are a scarce resource, however the current allocation policy—proposed in 2016 and implemented in 2018—has not addressed certain disparities. Between 2005 and 2016, the number of active candidates increased 127%, whereas transplant rates decreased 27.8%. Pretransplant mortality rates declined steadily for that period from 14.6 to 9.7, especially for candidates with mechanical circulatory assistive devices (MCSDs). This study reports survival analyses of candidates for heart transplantation list under competing events of transplantation and MCSD implantation. We queried the transplant data for a cohort of adult patients (age ≥ 16) without MCSDs prior to listing for transplantation between 2005 and 2014 ( n = 23,373). We used cause-specific and subdistribution hazards models as multivariate regressions for all competing events. Patients listed as low priority for transplantation are less likely to require implantation but less likely to survive after 1,000 days of listing than patients listed at higher priorities. The current policy does not address this disparity as it focuses on stratifying patients with different types of MCSD. Clinical characteristics must be considered in prioritization."
https://openalex.org/W4290852050,"Background Existing evidence indicates that a significant amount of biomedical research involving animals remains unpublished. At the same time, we lack standards for measuring the extent of results reporting in animal research. Publication rates may vary significantly depending on the level of measurement such as an entire animal study, individual experiments within a study, or the number of animals used. Methods Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 18 experts and qualitative content analysis, we investigated challenges and opportunities for the measurement of incomplete reporting of biomedical animal research with specific reference to the German situation. We further investigate causes of incomplete reporting. Results The in-depth expert interviews revealed several reasons for why incomplete reporting in animal research is difficult to measure at all levels under the current circumstances. While precise quantification based on regulatory approval documentation is feasible at the level of entire studies, measuring incomplete reporting at the more individual experiment and animal levels presents formidable challenges. Expert-interviews further identified six drivers of incomplete reporting of results in animal research. Four of these are well documented in other fields of research: a lack of incentives to report non-positive results, pressures to ‘deliver’ positive results, perceptions that some data do not add value, and commercial pressures. The fifth driver, reputational concerns, appears to be far more salient in animal research than in human clinical trials. The final driver, socio-political pressures, may be unique to the field. Discussion Stakeholders in animal research should collaborate to develop a clear conceptualisation of complete reporting in animal research, facilitate valid measurements of the phenomenon, and develop incentives and rewards to overcome the causes for incomplete reporting."

Using 2016 National Disability Survey data, we explored the sociodemographics of people with anxiety and/or depression and its heightened burden on access to key services. The survey (n = 13,073) used the Washington Group Extended Set to estimate disability prevalence, including anxiety and/or depression. A nested case-control study was included to explore the impact of disability on key life areas. Cases (indicating 'A lot of difficulty' or 'Cannot do' in one or more functional domain) and age-/sex-matched controls were administered a structured questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regression and heightened-burden analysis were conducted. Higher odds of anxiety and/or depression were found in participants who were 50+ (aOR 2.3, 1.8-3.1), female (aOR 1.8, 1.4-2.2), urban (aOR 1.5, 1.2-1.9), divorced/separated (aOR 2.0, 1.3-3.0), and widowed (aOR 1.6, 1.0-2.4), as well as those with impaired communication or cognition (aOR 17.6, 13.0-23.8), self-care (aOR 13.2, 8.5-20.5), walking (aOR 13.3, 9.7-18.3), hearing (aOR 8.5, 5.6-13.1), and vision (aOR 8.5, 6.1-11.8). Lower odds of anxiety and/or depression were found in participants with a university education (aOR 0.2, 0.5-0.9), and those living in the southeast (aOR 0.2, 0.1-0.3) or northeast (aOR 0.3, 0.2-0.4). Compared to people with impairments that were not depression and/or anxiety, people with depression and/or anxiety were less likely to receive a retirement pension (aOR 0.4, 0.2-0.8), and more likely to receive medication for depression/anxiety (aOR 4.1, 1.9-9.1), report a serious health problem (aOR 1.8, 1.3-2.5), and seek advice/treatment with a government health worker/health post (aOR 6.3, 1.0-39.2)."
https://openalex.org/W4290852185,"Narwhals and belugas are toothed whales belonging to the Monodontidae. Belugas have a circumpolar Arctic and sub-Artic distribution while narwhals are restricted to the Atlantic Arctic. Their geographical ranges overlap during winter migrations in the Baffin Bay area (Canada/West Greenland) and successful interbreeding may occur. Here, we employed geometric morphometrics on museum specimens to explore the cranium and mandible morphology of a known hybrid (NHMD MCE 1356) and the cranium morphology of a putative hybrid (NHMD 1963.44.1.4) relative to skull morphological variation in the parental species. Specifically, we used 3D models of skulls from 69 belugas, 86 narwhals, and the two known/putative hybrids and 2D left hemi-mandibles from 20 belugas, 64 narwhals and the known hybrid. Skull shape analyses allowed clear discrimination between species. Narwhals are characterised by a relatively short rostrum and wide neurocranium while belugas show a more elongated and narrower cranium. Sexual size dimorphism was detected in narwhals, with males larger than females, but no sexual shape dimorphism was detected in either species (excluding presence/absence of tusks in narwhals). Morphological skull variation was also dependent on different allometric slopes between species and sexes in narwhals. Our analyses showed that the cranium of the known hybrid was phenotypically close to belugas but its 2D hemi-mandible had a narwhal shape and size morphology. Both cranium and mandible were strongly correlated, with the pattern of covariation being similar to belugas. The putative hybrid was a pure male narwhal with extruded teeth. Comparison of genomic DNA supported this result, and stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values suggested that the putative hybrid had a more benthic foraging strategy compared to narwhals. This work demonstrates that although the known hybrid could be discriminated from narwhals and belugas, detection of its affinities with these parental species was dependent on the part of the skull analysed."
https://openalex.org/W4293154106,"Protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) has been reported to be involved in various diseases. The expression of PRMT1 was increased in cirrhotic livers from human patients. However, the role of PRMT1 in hepatic fibrogenesis remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the effect of PRMT1 on hepatic fibrogenesis and its underlying mechanism. We found that PRMT1 expression was significantly higher in fibrotic livers of the mice treated with thioacetamide (TAA) or 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that PRMT1 expression was augmented in both hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in the fibrotic livers. Applying a selective inhibitor of PRMT1, PT1001B, significantly suppressed PRMT1 activity and mitigated liver fibrosis in mice. Hepatocyte-specific Prmt1 knockout did not affect liver fibrosis in mice. PRMT1 overexpression promoted the expression of fibrotic genes in the LX-2 cells, whereas knockdown of PRMT1 or treatment with PT1001B exhibited reversal effects, suggesting that PRMT1 plays an important role in HSC activation. Additionally, HSC-specific Prmt1 knockout attenuated HSC activation and liver fibrosis in TAA-induced fibrotic model. RNA-seq analysis revealed that Prmt1 knockout in HSCs significantly suppressed pro-inflammatory NF-κB and pro-fibrotic TGF-β signals, and also downregulated the expression of pro-fibrotic mediators in mouse livers. Moreover, treatment with PT1001B consistently inhibited hepatic inflammatory response in fibrotic model. In conclusion, PRMT1 plays a vital role in HSC activation. Inhibition of PRMT1 mitigates hepatic fibrosis by attenuating HSC activation in mice. Therefore, targeting PRMT1 could be a feasible therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W4290850793,"Although the activity levels of insect societies are assumed to contribute to their ergonomic efficiency, most studies of the temporal organization of ant colony activity have focused on only a few species. Little is known about the variation in activity patterns across colonies and species, and in different environmental contexts. In this study, the activity patterns of colonies of the red ant Myrmica rubra were characterized over 15 consecutive days. The main goals were to evaluate the colony specificity of the activity patterns and the impact of food deprivation on these patterns. We found that the average activity level varied across colonies and remained consistent over 1 week, providing evidence that the activity level is a colony-specific life trait. Furthermore, all colonies applied an energy-saving strategy, decreasing their average levels of activity inside the nest, when starved. Starvation induced no consistent change in the activity level outside of the nest. An analysis of activity time series revealed activity bursts, with nestmates being active (or inactive) together, the amplitudes of which reflected the ants' degree of synchronization. Food deprivation increased the amplitude and number of these activity bursts. Finally, wavelet analyses of daily activity patterns revealed no evidence of any periodicity of activity bouts occurring inside or outside of the nest. This study showed that M. rubra ant colonies are characterized by specific activity levels that decrease in response to starvation with the adoption of an energy-saving strategy. In addition, our results help to understand the functional value associated with synchronized and/or periodic fluctuation in activity, which has been debated for years."
https://openalex.org/W4290851028,"Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG among health care workers (HCWs) is crucial to inform infection control programs. Conflicting reports have emerged on the longevity of SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Our objective is to describe the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in HCWs and perform 8 months longitudinal follow-up (FU) to assess the duration of detectable IgG. In addition, we aim to explore the risk factors associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The study was conducted at a large COVID-19 public hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All HCWs were recruited by social media platform. The SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen was used. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine association between IgG seropositive status and clinical and epidemiological factors. A total of 2528 (33% of the 7737 eligible HCWs) participated in the survey and 2523 underwent baseline serological testing in June 2020. The largest occupation groups sampled were nurses [n = 1351(18%)], physicians [n = 456 (6%)], administrators [n = 277 (3.6%)], allied HCWs [n = 205(3%)], pharmacists [n = 95(1.2%)], respiratory therapists [n = 40(0.5%)], infection control staff [n = 21(0.27%], and others [n = 83 (1%)]. The total cohort median age was 36 (31–43) years and 66.3% were females. 273 were IgG seropositive at baseline with a seroprevalence of 10.8% 95% CI (9.6%-12.1%). 165/185 and 44/112 were persistently IgG positive, at 2–3 months and 6 months FU respectively. The median (25 th – 75 th percentile) IgG level at the 3 different time points was 5.86 (3.57–7.04), 3.91 (2.46–5.38), 2.52 (1.80–3.99) respectively. Respiratory therapists OR 2.38, ( P = 0.035), and those with hypertension OR = 1.86, ( P = 0.009) were more likely to be seropositive. A high proportion of seropositive staff had prior symptoms 214/273(78%), prior anosmia was associated with the presence of antibodies, with an odds ratio of 9.25 (P&lt;0.001), as well as fever and cough. Being a non-smoker, non-Saudi, and previously diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by PCR were statistically significantly different by seroprevalence status. We found that the seroprevalence of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen was 10.8% in HCWs at the peak of the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. We also observed a decreasing temporal trend of IgG seropositivity over 8 months follow up period."
https://openalex.org/W4290851098,"Decisions regarding the evaluation of children with influenza infection rely on the likelihood of severe disease. The role of early vital signs as predictors of severe influenza infection in children is not well known. Our objectives were to determine the value of vital signs in predicting hospitalization/recurrent emergency department (ED) visits due to influenza infection in children.We conducted a prospective study of children aged 6 months to 8 years of age with influenza like illness evaluated at an ED/UC from 2016-2018. All children underwent influenza testing by PCR. We collected heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature, and converted heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) to z-scores by age. HR z scores were further adjusted for temperature. Our primary outcome was hospitalization/recurrent ED visits within 72 hours. Vital sign predictors with p< 0.2 and other clinical covariates were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model to determine odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI; model performance was assessed using the Brier score and discriminative ability with the C statistic.Among 1478 children, 411 (27.8%) were positive for influenza, of which 42 (10.2%) were hospitalized or had a recurrent ED visit. In multivariable analyses, adjusting for age, high-risk medical condition and school/daycare attendance, higher adjusted respiratory rate (OR 2.09, 95%CI 1.21-3.61, p = 0.0085) was a significant predictor of influenza hospitalization/recurrent ED visits.Higher respiratory rate adjusted for age was the most useful vital sign predictor of severity among young children with PCR-confirmed influenza."
https://openalex.org/W4290851340,"Background Although chronic pain (CP) is common, little is known about its economic burden in Alberta, Canada. Aims To estimate incremental (as compared to the general population or people without CP) societal (healthcare and lost productivity) costs of CP in Alberta. Methods We applied the prevalence estimated from the Canadian Community Health Survey data to the population retrieved from the Statistics Canada to estimate the number of people with CP in Alberta in 2019. We analyzed the Alberta Health administrative databases to estimate the healthcare costs of person with CP. Finally, we multiplied the number of people with the cost per person. Results The prevalence of any CP was 20.1% and of activity-preventing CP was 14.5% among people aged &gt; = 12 years. Incremental cost per person with CP per year was CA$2,217 for healthcare services (among people aged &gt; = 12 years) and CA$8,412 for productivity losses (among people aged 18–64 years). Of the healthcare cost, prescription drugs accounted for the largest share (32.8%), followed by inpatient services (31.0%), outpatient services (13.1%), physician services (9.8%), other services (7.4%), and diagnostic imaging (5.8%). Provincially, total incremental cost of CP ranges from CA$1.2 to 1.7 billion for healthcare services (6% to 8% of total provincial health expenditure); and CA$3.4 to 4.7 billion for productivity losses. Considering costs for long-term care services, the total societal cost of CP in Alberta was CA$6.3 to 8.3 billion per year, reflecting 2.0% to 2.7% of Alberta’s GDP. Conclusions Interventions improving CP prevention and management to reduce this substantial economic burden are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W4290851374,"The ancestry of each locus of the genome can be estimated (local ancestry) based on sequencing or genotyping information together with reference panels of ancestral source populations. The length of those ancestry-specific genomic segments are commonly used to understand migration waves and admixture events. In short time scales, it is often of interest to determine the existence of the most recent unadmixed ancestor from a specific population t generations ago. We built a hypothesis test to determine if an individual has an ancestor belonging to a target ancestral population t generations ago based on these lengths of the ancestry-specific segments at an individual level. We applied this test on a data set that includes 20 Uruguayan admixed individuals to estimate for each one how many generations ago the most recent indigenous ancestor lived. As this method tests each individual separately, it is particularly suited to small sample sizes, such as our study or ancient genome samples."
https://openalex.org/W4290851411,"Studies have shown associative-memory decline in aging. While the literature is inconclusive regarding the source of the deficit, some researchers argue that it is caused by impaired encoding and maintenance processes in working-memory (WM). Successful retrieval of a stimulus depends on its sequential presentation in the learning list: stimuli at the beginning or the end of the learning list benefit from higher retrieval probability. These effects are known as “primacy” and “recency” effects, respectively. In the case of the primacy-effect, stimuli at early list positions benefit from extensive rehearsal that results in enhanced consolidation and trace in long-term memory (LTM). In the case of the recency-effect, target stimuli at later serial positions are still maintained in WM and can therefore be effortlessly retrieved. Considering these effects could shed light on the involvement of WM in associative-binding. Both behavioral and neuroimaging researchers have studied associative-decline in aging. However, no work has explicitly tested age differences in memory for items versus associations as a function of stimuli serial position (SSP). In the current study, 22 younger and 22 older adults were recruited to participate in a study aimed to test the separate and joint effects of both SSP and aging on memory-recognition of items and associations. In the task used, retrieval was manipulated for SSP (beginning/middle/end of the list) and item/associations recognition modes. We hypothesized that greater associative-decline will be observed in older adults, specifically for recently presented material. The results showed that both groups presented a significant associative-deficit at the recency positions; this decrease was additive and did not correspond to the expected interaction effect. Further analysis showed that the source of associative-memory decline for stimuli at recency position in older adults resulted from an increase in false-alarm (FA) rates. These results support the involvement of WM-binding impairment in aging."
https://openalex.org/W4290851754,"Genetic diversity within and among populations is frequently used in prioritization processes to rank populations based on their vulnerability or distinctiveness, however, connectivity and gene flow are rarely considered within these frameworks. Using a wood turtle ( Glyptemys insculpta ) population graph, we introduce BRIDES as a new tool to evaluate populations for conservation purpose without focusing solely on individual nodes. BRIDES characterizes different types of shortest paths among the nodes of a subgraph and compares the shortest paths among the same nodes in a complete network. The main objectives of this study were to (1) introduce a BRIDES selection process to assist conservation biologists in the prioritization of populations, and (2) use different centrality indices and node removal statistics to compare BRIDES results and assess gene flow among wood turtle populations. We constructed six population subgraphs and used a stepwise selection algorithm to choose the optimal number of additional nodes, representing different populations, required to maximize network connectivity under different weighting schemes. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the BRIDES selection process for a given scenario, while inconsistencies were observed among node-based metrics. Results showed repeated selection of certain wood turtle populations, which could have not been predicted following only genetic diversity and distinctiveness estimation, node-based metrics and node removal analysis. Contrary to centrality measures focusing on static networks, BRIDES allowed for the analysis of evolving networks. To our knowledge, this study is the first to apply graph theory for turtle conservation genetics. We show that population graphs can reveal complex gene flow dynamics and population resiliency to local extinction. As such, BRIDES offers an interesting complement to node-based metrics and node removal to better understand the global processes at play when addressing population prioritization frameworks."
https://openalex.org/W4290851845,"Objectives The study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on physical activity and frequency of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapies of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices. Methods and results Physical activity, heart rate and ICD-therapies were assessed via routine remote monitoring over two years. We focussed on a 338-day period during COVID-19 pandemic that was divided in 6 time-intervals defined by public health interventions and compared to the previous regular year. Paired nonparametric longitudinal analysis was performed to detect differences between time-intervals. To model effects of age, sex and time we applied a nonparametric ANOVA-type-statistic. 147 patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices were analysed. Longitudinal analysis of physical activity in 2019 and 2020 showed a specific weekly and seasonal pattern. Physical activity was reduced during the pandemic (mean daily physical activity 2019: 12.4% vs. 2020: 11.5%; p&lt;0.0001) with the strongest reductions (fold changes 0.885/0.889, p&lt;0.0001/p&lt;0.0001) during the two lockdown-periods. In older patients (&gt;70 years), physical activity was decreased in every time-interval of the year 2020. In time-intervals of eased restrictions, physical activity of younger patients (≤70 years) was not different compared to 2019. No variation in mean heart rate, arrhythmia-burden and count of ICD-therapies was found. Conclusion Physical activity shows fluctuations dependent on days of the week and time of the year. During the pandemic, physical activity was reduced in patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices with the strongest reductions during lockdown-periods. Younger patients resumed former levels of physical activity in times of eased restrictions while older patients remained less active. Thus, activation of the elderly population is important to prevent long-term health impairments due to the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4290851944,"Background Prediction of SARS-CoV-2-induced sick leave among healthcare workers (HCWs) is essential for being able to plan the healthcare response to the epidemic. Methods During first wave of the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic (April 23 rd to June 24 th , 2020), the HCWs in the greater Stockholm region in Sweden were invited to a study of past or present SARS-CoV-2 infection. We develop a discrete time Markov model using a cohort of 9449 healthcare workers (HCWs) who had complete data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies as well as sick leave data for the calendar year 2020. The one-week and standardized longer term transition probabilities of sick leave and the ratios of the standardized probabilities for the baseline covariate distribution were compared with the referent period (an independent period when there were no SARS-CoV-2 infections) in relation to PCR results, serology results and gender. Results The one-week probabilities of transitioning from healthy to partial sick leave or full sick leave during the outbreak as compared to after the outbreak were highest for healthy HCWs testing positive for large amounts of virus (ratio: 3.69, (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.44–5.59) and 6.67 (95% CI: 1.58–28.13), respectively). The proportion of all sick leaves attributed to COVID-19 during outbreak was at most 55% (95% CI: 50%-59%). Conclusions A robust Markov model enabled use of simple SARS-CoV-2 testing data for quantifying past and future COVID-related sick leave among HCWs, which can serve as a basis for planning of healthcare during outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W4290851965,"Service design is an innovative tool used to improve the quality of patient experience, therefore, making it necessary for nurses to be able to implement it. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a training program for patient experience-based nursing service design (PEN-SD) on clinical nurses' compassion and problem-solving ability. This study employed a mixed-methods design: a one-group, pretest-posttest design was used as the quantitative approach, and structured interviews were used as the qualitative approach. The participants were 21 nurses recruited from a university hospital in Korea. A PEN-SD training program was conducted from September 1 to October 6, 2018. After the training program, the participants' compassion significantly improved (p = .025) but there was no significant difference in their problem-solving ability (p = .313). In the structured interviews, majority of the participants (n = 17) felt that they were able to consider problems from the patient's perspective. They also reported being able to identify solutions to problems through careful observation (n = 5). The PEN-SD training program was effective in improving compassion among nurses."
