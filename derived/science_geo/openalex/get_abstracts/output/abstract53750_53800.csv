This observation suggests a mechanism for the induction of RNA synthesis by those hormones that cause increases in the concentration of cyclic AMP."

https://openalex.org/W1531828321,"Abstract Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) increases the differential rate of synthesis of β-galactosidase in Escherichia coli made permeable by treatment with tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane and ethylenediamintetraacetic acid. In normal, growing cells, cyclic AMP overcomes the transient repression of β-galactosidase by glucose. A half-maximal effect of cyclic AMP occurs at about 7 x 10-5 m. Cyclic AMP overcomes the transient repression of β-galactosidase synthesis in two regulatory mutants which produce β-galactosidase constitutively, 3300 (i-) and Oc67. Cyclic AMP also acts in cells which are deficient in the lac permease. Cyclic AMP overcomes the transient repression of β-galactosidase synthesis produced by α-methylglucoside in strain C600 which has normal regulatory genes. In mutant LA-12G, which is resistant to permanent repression, cyclic AMP also overcomes transient glucose repression. In cells treated with chloramphenicol, isopropylthio-β-d-galactopyranoside promotes the accumulation of β-galactosidase-specific messenger RNA, glucose prevents its accumulation, and cyclic AMP overcomes this repression by glucose. Cyclic AMP also overcomes the glucose repression of mRNA production in a threonine-requiring mutant during threonine starvation. Cyclic AMP fails to stimulate β-galactosidase production in cells in which mRNA synthesis has been arrested by inducer removal or proflavine addition. Thus, cyclic AMP appears to participate in the regulation of β-galactosidase mRNA synthesis at the gene level."

Small doses of prostaglandins (PGE(1), PGE(2), or PGF(1infinity) 1.4 to 2.4 micromolar) increased steroidogenesis in the superfused adrenal glands obtained from hypophysectomized rats. This effect was mimicked in part by both adrenocorticotropin and its postulated intracellular intermediate adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate; all three responses were inhibited by cycloheximide."
https://openalex.org/W1574115447,"Abstract Seedlings of blue lupine, sorghum, and common vetch which convert H14CN extensively into the amide carbon of asparagine have been shown to utilize l-cysteine-3-14C as the source of the other 3 carbon atoms of asparagine. The presence of HCN in the atmosphere in which the plants are grown greatly stimulates the conversion of 14C in the cysteine into asparagine. l-Serine-1-14C is also converted into asparagine by sorghum seedlings, and the amount of conversion is stimulated 3-fold by HCN. Seedlings of common vetch also convert l-serine-1-14C into the β-cyanoalanine moiety of the lathyritic dipeptide γ-glutamyl-β-cyanoalanine, but this conversion is not affected by the presence of HCN. Buffered extracts of acetone powders of seedlings of sorghum, blue lupine, common vetch, and bird's-foot trefoil catalyze the formation of β-cyanoalanine and H2S from l-cysteine and HCN. The enzyme responsible, which has been tentatively named β-cyanoalanine synthase, may be exhibited by incubating radioactive l-cysteine or H14CN with the extracts and the other unlabeled substrate and measuring the β-cyanoalanine-14C formed. The enzyme may also be assayed by measuring colorimetrically the H2S formed. H14C15N is converted by sorghum seedlings to the amide group of asparagine without any separation of the C and N atoms of the cyanide group."
https://openalex.org/W1995318648,"A rapid method for determining the density of ribonucleoprotein particles and complexes has been developed. The method involves glutaraldehyde fixation of sucrose gradient fractions and immediate centrifugation for 5 hours through preformed cesium chloride gradients. There is little or no aggregation of particles, so that components which co-sediment in sucrose gradients are resolved by the cesium chloride gradient. By this method the densities of HeLa cell ribosomes, polyribosomes, and subribosomal particles have been determined. Furthermore, the poliovirus replication complex has been separated from polyribosomes and its density has been found to be unaffected by treatment with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2003090273,"In a passive avoidance situation, hypophysectomized male rats show less fear than normal rats, whereas adrenalectomized rats show greater fear than normals. These results probably occur because hypophysectomized rats lack adrenocorticotrophic hormone, which increases arousal or emotionality, whereas adrenalectomized animals lack certain adrenal steroids, which inhibit excitatory effects. The results indicate that adrenocorticotrophic hormone and certain adrenal steroids have opposite effects in regulating fear-motivated behavior."

https://openalex.org/W1585066730,"Abstract When presented with glucose, an Escherichia coli mutant lacking both phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase accumulated, internally, high concentrations (approximately 50 mm) of glucose 6-phosphate. It also accumulated glucose in polysaccharide form. Other metabolism of glucose, if any, was very restricted. The accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate was associated with inhibition of growth on those carbon sources the metabolism of which requires functional fructose disphosphatase activity; inhibition of this enzyme in vitro by high concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate was shown."

https://openalex.org/W2020311673,"Thyroid-stimulating hormone increased the cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate concentration in dog thyroid slices during a 1-minute incubation period and produced a maximum effect soon thereafter. The elevation persisted for at least 30 minutes. The concentrations of the cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate increased as the TSH concentration was increased from 0.125 to 50 milliunits per milliliter. Prostaglandin E(1), which increases glucose oxidation in dog thyroid slices, also increased the concentration of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate. Although sodium fluoride stimulates thyroid adenyl cyclase, it did not increase concentration of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate. Carbamylcholine and menadiol sodium diphosphate augment glucose oxidation in dog thyroid slices but do not change concentrations of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1540554140,"Abstract 1. Reconstitution of a complex which catalyzes the oxidation of succinate by molecular oxygen has been achieved by combining purified enzymes from bovine heart mitochondria with phospholipids and Q10. The activity was dependent on succinate dehydrogenase, cytochromes b, c, and c1, and cytochrome oxidase but no requirement for an additional non-heme iron protein could be shown. 2. The successful resolution of cytochrome b from other respiratory components by cleavage with 1.33 m guanidine was dependent on the presence of both succinate and glycerol. 3. In order to achieve maximal activity, periods of incubation at 37° up to several hours were required, particularly when soybean phospholipids were used. 4. The rate of oxidation of succinate by this complex was comparable to that of phosphorylating submitochondrial particles."
https://openalex.org/W1568484857,"Abstract At an optional magnesium sulfate concentration (5 mm), initial velocity analyses of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8) purified from human erythrocytes resulted in parallel lines on double reciprocal plots. A nonparallel pattern was observed at 0.05 mm magnesium sulfate, but only at relatively high 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PP-ribose-P) concentrations. Product inhibition by mononucleotides was competitive with PP-ribose-P and noncompetitive with hypoxanthine. GMP, GDP, and GTP were more inhibitory than IMP. PPi was an effective inhibitor at low magnesium sulfate concentrations but an ineffective inhibitor at high levels of this salt. PPi stimulated exchange between IMP and 14C-hypoxanthine. This exchange was slow as compared with the rate of IMP synthesis, and pyrophosphorolysis was slow as compared with the exchange rate. Binding of 14C-GMP to the free enzyme was shown by Sephadex chromatography. The relative elution patterns of the radioactivity and the enzyme activity suggested that the bulk of the binding was noncovalent. The sulfhydryl reactants, p-chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide, inactivated the enzyme. Preliminary treatment with PP-ribose-P protected the enzyme against inactivation by these reactants. Preliminary treatment of the enzyme with PP-ribose-P also resulted in an initial burst of IMP synthesis when hypoxanthine was added. Since none of the previously considered mechanisms, ordered sequential and ping-pong, are entirely consistent with the experimental results, a mechanism involving alternate reaction sequences is considered."
https://openalex.org/W1572400827,"Abstract A purification procedure has been developed for the isolation of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase (EC 2.4.2.14, ribosylamine 5-phosphate:pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase) from pigeon liver. It has been shown that the enzyme molecule of molecular weight 200,000 dissociates readily into 100,000 mol wt subunits and that these, in the presence of thiols, dissociate into 50,000 mol wt subunits. These basic 50,000 mol wt subunits, or monomers, are identical electrophoretically. Each 100,000 mol wt subunit, or dimer, contains 6 nonheme iron atoms some of which are involved in the catalytic reaction, whereas others serve primarily a structural function. The visible absorption spectrum of the enzyme reveals a maximum at 415 mµ, which disappears with the removal of iron from the protein. The tetramer, dimer, and monomer forms, as isolated, are enzymatically active and subject to purine ribonucleotide inhibition. The molecular weight of the functionally active unit, however, is unknown."

https://openalex.org/W2060361076,The lumbar motor columns of a cynomolgus monkey that had become tetraplegic after experimental infection with a highly virulent strain of type 3 poliovirus were examined by electron microscopy. Crystalline aggregates of poliovirus occurred within the endoplasmic reticulum of endothelial cells as well as of mononuclear inflammatory cells. This finding suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum might be much more involved in poliovirus multiplication than has been previously supposed.
https://openalex.org/W1584555056,"Abstract An enzyme capable of catalyzing the reaction AMP + PPi + P-enolpyruvate ⇌ ATP + Pi + pyruvate was obtained from Bacteroides symbiosus cell extracts and was purified from interfering enzyme activities. It was strongly stimulated by ammonium ion. In this respect and in other physical properties the bacterial enzyme differed from that previously obtained from Entamoeba histolytica. In a complete reaction system the enzyme transferred label from orthophosphate to pyrophosphate and to the γ position of ATP while the label of 32P-enolpyruvate was transferred to the β position of ATP. The observed equilibrium constant catalyzed by the bacterial enzyme was directly dependent upon the square of the hydrogen ion concentration. At pH 7.0 its value was 1140. Apparent Km values for P-enolpyruvate and pyrophosphate were 0.07 mm and 0.1 mm for the amebal enzyme and 0.06 mm and 0.1 mm for the bacterial enzyme, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2197966293,"Abstract Kinetic studies of the pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase have revealed that the enzyme is sensitive to inhibition by malonyl coenzyme A, one of the substrates of fatty acid synthesis. The inhibition is of the mixed type with respect to acetyl-CoA, and is competitive with respect to TPNH. Malonyl-CoA most markedly affects the Km for TPNH, increasing it 19-fold over a malonyl-CoA concentration range of 10 to 37.5 µm. The inhibition by malonyl-CoA can be reversed by fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and this reversal is reflected in a progressive decrease in the Km for TPNH with increasing fructose 1,6-diphosphate concentrations. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate does not markedly affect the Km values for either acetyl-CoA or malonyl-CoA. Some of the kinetic patterns obtained, such as nonlinear reciprocal coordinate plots for the rate of fatty acid synthesis against malonyl-CoA concentration and nonlinear Dixon plots for the malonyl-CoA inhibition, suggest that the substrate inhibition seen in this study may be due to substrate binding at a regulatory site rather than to the classically invoked interaction of substrate molecules at an active site."

https://openalex.org/W171635663,"Abstract Pyrophosphatase activity of rat liver phosphodiesterase, which forms nucleoside 5'-monophosphates, was studied. Evidence is presented that NADH, adenosine 5'-diphosphate ribose, and a polymer of phosphoribosyl-AMP (poly (ADPR)) were hydrolyzed by this enzyme. The mode of action of the enzyme on poly ADPR was studied. 1. The enzyme hydrolyzed poly ADPR to produce the same product as was formed by phosphodiesterase from snake venom. 2. Kinetic studies suggest that both the phosphodiester compounds, p-nitrophenyl urinine 5'-monophosphate and poly ADPR, were hydrolyzed by the same site or by overlapping active sites. 3. Poly ADPR was not hydrolyzed randomly, but rather in an exonucleolytic fashion. Little DNA or RNA was hydrolyzed by an amount of enzyme sufficient to decompose half the initial amount of the substrate, poly ADPR."
https://openalex.org/W1541738060,"Abstract Evidence is presented that is interpreted as reflecting a codon-directed specific requirement for deacylated transfer RNA in reactions associated in sequence with the initiation of polyphenylalanine synthesis in a fractionated transfer system derived from rabbit reticulocytes. The ability of deacylated transfer RNA to participate in these early reactions, as measured by a shift in the optimum Mg++ concentration for the synthesis of polyphenylalanine, is destroyed by mild oxidation with sodium periodate under conditions which destroy the ability of transfer RNA to accept amino acids. After periodate oxidation (to remove activity due to contaminating deacylated transfer RNA), preparations of transfer RNA containing phenylalanyl-tRNA or N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA are also inactive in these early reactions of chain initiation. Evidence is also presented that is interpreted as indicating that N-acylated amino acids may play no role in the initiation of α and β chains of globin. N-Formylmethionyl-tRNA was not detected in preparations containing methionyl-tRNA formed in intact reticulocytes. Similar results were obtained for the N-acetyl and N-formyl derivatives of phenylalanine, valine, alanine, leucine, and serine. Furthermore, very little formate, if any, is present as the NH2-terminal residues of incomplete globin peptide chains that are initiated in intact cells and that remain attached to polysomes during isolation. Most, if not all, of these nascent globin chains exist with valine with a free amino group as the NH2-terminal amino acid. It is suggested that the initiation of synthesis of globin peptides may involve a codon-directed requirement for deacylated transfer RNA, by a mechanism similar to that involved in the initiation of polyphenylalanine synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1526291384,"The synthesis of triacetic acid lactone (TAL) is effected by purified soluble pigeon liver fatty acid synthetase. This enzyme system synthesizes TAL from acetyl coenzyme A and malonyl coenzyme A in the absence of TPNH, and synthesizes palmitic acid in the presence of TPNH. The major product of the reaction in the absence of TPNH is TAL, and not free triacetic acid. Presumably triacetic acid, bound as a thioester to the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of the fatty acid synthetase, is an intermediate in the formation of TAL. The latter compound is formed from 1 mole of acetyl-CoA and 2 moles of malonyl-CoA in the sequence, acetate-malonate-malonate (proceeding left to right from the methyl end of the molecule). The synthesis of TAL is inhibited by either TPN+ or TPNH. The very strong inhibition by both forms of the nucleotide implies that TAL is not synthesized in vivo by the avian soluble fatty acid synthetase."

https://openalex.org/W2035186119,"Dendritic action potentials in alligator Purkinje cells tend to have a unidirectional preference which favors centripetal over centrifugal propagation. This unidirectional tendency funnels the peripherally evoked dendritic spikes into the lower dendrites and soma of these cells, and it allows the peripheral dendritic branches to operate to a certain extent as partially independent functional units."

https://openalex.org/W1601805780,"Abstract Ghosts of isolated fat cells take up α-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB) by a saturable and partially energy-dependent transport process. Of several amino acids tested, methionine and alanine were the most effective in inhibiting influx and stimulating efflux of AIB, indicating that the transport of these amino acids and AIB is shared by a common carrier-mediated system in the plasma membrane of ghosts. The uptake of AIB was stimulated by sodium ion, inhibited by ouabain, and diminished in the absence of potassium ion in the incubation medium. The initial rate of AIB influx was not correlated to the initial rate of potassium influx. The results suggest that the capacity of ghosts to accumulate and maintain a steady state content of AIB is a function of the potassium and sodium gradients across the plasma membrane but is not directly linked to active sodium-potassium transport. Sodium-potassium transport is probably the major energy-requiring process involved in the accumulation of AIB. Insulin, adrenocorticotropin, and epinephrine did not alter the rate of uptake or the steady state levels of AIB in preparations of ghosts that are sensitive, with respect to glucose transport or metabolism, to the effects of these hormones."
https://openalex.org/W88925527,"Abstract A new cytidine nucleotide was found in Azotobacter vinelandii strain O. On the basis of chemical analyses, mass spectra, infrared spectra, nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, periodate oxidation studies, and a series of degradation studies followed by comparison with authentic samples, it is proposed that the new compound is cytidine-5'-diphospho-6-deoxy-3-C-methyl-2-O-methyl-4-O-(O-methylglycolyl)-l-aldohexopyranose. The compound is therefore an O-methylglycolic acid ester of cytidine-5'-diphospho-vinelose previously found in the same microorganism."

https://openalex.org/W1535050730,"Abstract l-Lactate-2-3H undergoes loss of tritium into water when incubated with red cells. Since lactate is not lost, this is an exchange. The exchange is stimulated 10-fold by glucose and this is reversed by iodoacetate. The tritium of glucose-4-3H, which would be expected to produce lactate-2-3H in glycolysis, is found in water. This exchange is not prevented by iodoacetate. From these results it is proposed that exchange detritiation of lactate occurs through the aldolase reaction, as follows: [see PDF for equation] catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-P dehydrogenase, triose-P isomerase, and fructose-di-P aldolase. Loss of 3H from lactate in ascites tumor cells occurring in the absence of glucose is largely inhibited by CO or Amytal. Upon addition of glucose the detritiation of lactate continues at about the same rate despite the inevitable dilution of the DPN3H pool by glycolytic DPNH, thus suggesting that a stimulation of DPN3H exchange has occurred as well. The detritiation in the presence of glucose is largely insensitive to amytal and CO, but is depressed by iodoacetate and AsO4, suggesting that the role of glucose in the detritiation of lactate is to provide glycerate-1,3-di-P in the above mechanism."

The question then arises whether or not normal proteins are synthesized during the recovery period. Although it is well established that the rate of amino-acid incorporation into polypeptide is only slightly reduced after moderate doses of X-irradiation3–6, it does not necessarily follow that the protein species synthesized in these conditions are functional. For example, cessation of functional protein in the presence of low doses of puromycin is almost immediate despite the fact that the rate of amino-acid incorporation is only slightly affected7."

https://openalex.org/W1998886761,"FRY1 recently criticized the Tanner and Whitehouse (TW) method of assessing skeletal maturity2 on the grounds that it shows excessive fluctuation in the velocity of maturation. He stated that, in a child whose chronological age advances 6 months, the method may show no advance of skeletal age or, alternatively, a skeletal advance of 23 months. Fry seems to have assigned TW ratings only to the plates in the Greulich–Pyle Atlas, so it is not at all clear how he arrives at the criticism, nor, indeed, precisely what is implied. I am able, however, to supply actual data on the mean rate of maturation of a population of children and on the variation between individual children rated in successive years by the TW method."
