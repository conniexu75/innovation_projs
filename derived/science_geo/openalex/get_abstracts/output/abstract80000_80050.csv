https://openalex.org/W2066168019,"In rats ischemia of the forebrain induced by a 30-minute occlusion of the carotid artery, followed by 120 minutes of arterial reperfusion, produced ischemic lesions of selectively vulnerable pyramidal cells in both hippocampi. Focal microinfusion into the dorsal hippocampus of 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, an antagonist of excitation at the N-methyl-D-aspartate-preferring receptor, before ischemia was induced protected against the development of ischemic damage. It is proposed that excitatory neurotransmission plays an important role in selective neuronal loss due to cerebral ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W2089298737,"From an acute B-cell leukemia cell line, a DNA probe was obtained that was specific for chromosome 18 and flanked the heavy chain joining region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus on chromosome 14. This probe detected rearrangement of the homologous DNA segment in the leukemic cells and in follicular lymphoma cells with the t(14:18) chromosome translocation but not in other neoplastic or normal B or T cells. The probe appears to identify bcl-2, a gene locus on chromosome 18 (band q21) that is unrelated to known oncogenes and may be important in the pathogenesis of B-cell neoplasms with this translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2016254453,"Adriamycin (doxorubicin), a potent antitumor drug in clinical use, interacts with nucleic acids and cell membranes, but the molecular basis for its antitumor activity is unknown. Similar to a number of intercalative antitumor drugs and nonintercalative epipodophyllotoxins (VP-16 and VM-26), adriamycin has been shown to induce single- and double-strand breaks in DNA. These strand breaks are unusual because a covalently bound protein appears to be associated with each broken phosphodiester bond. In studies in vitro, mammalian DNA topoisomerase II mediates DNA damage by adriamycin and other related antitumor drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2087166333,"Since the discovery in 1969 of a man-made surface-active material that would bond to bone, a range of materials with the same ability has been developed. These include glass, glass-ceramic, and ceramic materials which have a range of reaction rates and from which it should be possible to select a surface-active material for a specific application. The available materials and their similarities, differences, and current clinical applications are reviewed."
https://openalex.org/W2055296386,Purified growth inhibitor from BSC-1 cells and type beta transforming growth factor from human platelets are shown to have nearly identical biological activity and to compete for binding to the same cell membrane receptor. These findings suggest that the growth inhibitor and the type beta transforming growth factor are similar molecules. The data also show that the same purified polypeptide can either stimulate or inhibit cell proliferation depending on the experimental conditions.
https://openalex.org/W1514525963,"Many intercalative antitumor drugs have been shown to induce reversible protein-linked DNA breaks in cultured mammalian cells. Using purified mammalian DNA topoisomerase II, we have demonstrated that the antitumor drugs ellipticine and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticine (2-Me-9-OH-E+) can produce reversible protein-linked DNA breaks in vitro. 2-Me-9-OH-E+ which is more cytotoxic toward L1210 cells and more active against experimental tumors than ellipticine is also more effective in stimulating DNA cleavage in vitro. Similar to the effect of 4'-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA) on topoisomerase II in vitro, the mechanism of DNA breakage induced by ellipticines is most likely due to the drug stabilization of a cleavable complex formed between topoisomerase II and DNA. Protein denaturant treatment of the cleavable complex results in DNA breakage and covalent linking of one topoisomerase II subunit to each 5'-end of the cleaved DNA. Cleavage sites on pBR322 DNA produced by ellipticine or 2-Me-9-OH-E+ treatment mapped at the same positions. However, many of these cleavage sites are distinctly different from those produced by the antitumor drug m-AMSA which also targets at topoisomerase II. Our results thus suggest that although mammalian DNA topoisomerase II may be a common target of these antitumor drugs, drug-DNA-topoisomerase interactions for different antitumor drugs may be different."
https://openalex.org/W1866116049,"The crystal structure of cytochrome c peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.5) has been refined to an R factor of 0.20 computed for all reflections to 1.7 A. The refined molecular model includes 263 bound water molecules and allows for x-ray scattering by amorphous solvent. The mean positional error in atomic coordinates is estimated to lie between 0.12 and 0.21 A. Two factors are identified which may account for the ability of the enzyme to stabilize high-oxidation states of the heme iron during catalysis: 1) the proximal histidine forms a hydrogen bond with a buried aspartic acid side chain, Asp-235; and 2) the heme environment is more polar than in the cytochromes c or globins, owing to the presence of the partially buried side-chain of Arg-48 and five water molecules bound in close proximity to the heme. Two of these occupy the presumed peroxide-binding site. Two candidates are likely for the side chain that is oxidized to a free radical during formation of Compound I: 1) Trp-51, which rests 3.3 A above the heme plane in close proximity (2.7 A) to the sixth coordination position; and 2) Met-172, which is 3.7 A from the heme. Nucleophilic stabilization of the methionyl cation radical may be possible via Asp-235. His-181 is found to lie coplanar with the heme in a niche between the two propionates near the suspected cytochrome c-binding site. A network of hydrogen bonds involving this histidine may provide a preferred pathway for electron transfer between hemes."

As a consequence, affected neurons are unable to form electrical synapses, whereas other neurons whose growth is unaffected can still interconnect. This result demonstrates that neurotransmitters can play a prominent role in regulating neuronal architecture and connectivity in addition to their classical role in neurotransmission."

https://openalex.org/W1965001673,"Complementary DNA clones of genes induced by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in BALB/c-3T3 cells were isolated; one such clone contains a domain having nucleotide sequence homology with the third exon of c-fos. This nucleotide sequence homology is reflected in the predicted amino acid sequences of the gene products. Under low stringency conditions, the mouse v-fos gene cross-hybridizes with the PDGF-inducible complementary DNA clone. However, the messenger RNA transcripts of mouse c-fos and the new fos-related gene can be distinguished by gel electrophoresis and by S1 nuclease analysis. Expression of the authentic c-fos gene is induced by PDGF and superinduced by the combination of PDGF and cycloheximide."
https://openalex.org/W2012876380,"Learning behavior similar to vertebrate classical conditioning was demonstrated for the mollusc Hermissenda crassicornis. Postsynaptic membrane changes within well-defined neural systems that mediate the learning play a casual role in recording the learned association for later recall. Specific ionic currents in neural tissue undergo transformations lasting days after associative training with physiologic stimuli. During acquisition the intracellular calcium increases; this increase is accompanied by specific potassium current reduction that lasts for days after conditioning. The increase of calcium enhances calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of proteins that either regulate or are part of ion channels. These currents and the conditions that precede their transformation occur in many types of vertebrate neurons, and hence this biophysical basis of Hermissenda learning could have relevance for species other than the gastropod studied."
https://openalex.org/W2059005571,"Peripheral blood leukocytes and saliva from 20 individuals, including four with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), ten with AIDS-related complex (ARC), and six healthy homosexual males at risk for AIDS, were compared as sources of transmissible human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III), the virus found to be the etiologic agent of AIDS. All of the AIDS and ARC patients and four of the six healthy homosexuals had evidence of prior exposure to HTLV-III as indicated by seropositivity for antibody to HTLV-III structural proteins. Infectious virus was isolated from the peripheral blood of one of the AIDS patients, four of the ARC patients, and two of the healthy homosexual males, consistent with previous reports. HTLV-III was also isolated from the saliva of four of the ARC patients and four of the healthy homosexuals. Virus was also observed by electron microscopy in material prepared by centrifugation of the saliva of one AIDS patient. Although AIDS does not appear to be transmitted by casual contact, the possibility that HTLV-III can be transmitted by saliva should be considered."
https://openalex.org/W2059770652,"Two of three chimpanzees given plasma from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or pre-AIDS showed serum antibodies to type III human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-III) 10 to 12 weeks after transfusion. One animal also developed lymphadenopathy, transient depression of the ratio of T4 to T8 lymphocytes, and impaired blastogenic responses. No opportunistic infections occurred. Adenopathy persisted for 32 weeks, and antibody to HTLV-III persisted for at least 48 weeks. This transmission of HTLV-III by lymphocyte-poor plasma confirms the potential risk of such plasma or plasma derivatives to recipients. The susceptibility of the chimpanzee to HTLV-III infection and the ability to simulate the human lymphadenopathy syndrome in this animal makes it a valuable model for further study of AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1531986635,"Fast myosin light chains (MLCf) 1 and 3 are proteins associated with the thick filament in vertebrate fast muscle fibers. MLC1f and MLC3f have complete sequence homology for the first 141 amino acids from their COO- end, but they differ in length and amino acid sequence at their NH+3 ends (MLC1f = 49 amino acids, MLC3f = 8 amino acids), and they are translated from different mRNAs. To elucidate the structural relationship between mammalian fast myosin light chain 1 and 3 isoforms, cDNA clones have been isolated from rat skeletal muscle and their primary nucleotide sequences were determined. MLC1f and MLC3f mRNAs display complete sequence identity in the 3' untranslated sequences (285 base pairs) and in the codons specifying the 142 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. In contrast, the sequences encoding the amino-terminal 49 and 8 amino acids of MLC1f and MLC3f, respectively, as well as their 5' untranslated regions, are highly divergent. Using the cloned cDNAs as probes we have isolated the single gene locus encoding both MLC1f and MLC3f in four overlapping genomic clones spanning over approximately 25 kilobase pairs (kb) of DNA. The sequences encoding the common body of MLC1f and MLC3f are distributed in 4 separate exons at the 3' end of the gene. The start of transcription site and 5' untranslated region of MLC3f is found 5 kb upstream from the common body while the MLC1f mRNA transcription start site and the exon specifying the 5' untranslated region and amino acid 1-40 of MLC1f lies about 10 kb further upstream. Strikingly, a mini-exon that specifies amino acids 41-49 of MLC1f is located downstream from the two MLC3f-specific exons (5' untranslated and amino acids 1-8) and is separated from the upstream MLC1f exons by 12 kb of DNA. This bizarre gene organization implies a novel form of alternative promoter utilization and RNA splicing that is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated in order to generate the mature MLC1f and MLC3f mRNAs from a single gene."

Brain ankyrin included two polypeptides of Mr = 210,000 and 220,000 that were nearly identical by peptide mapping and were monomers in solution. Brain ankyrin and erythrocyte ankyrin are closely related proteins with the following properties in common: 1) shared antigenic sites, 2) high-affinity binding to the spectrin beta subunit at the midregion of spectrin tetramers, 3) a binding site for the cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte anion channel, 4) a binding site for tubulin, 5) a similar domain structure with a protease-resistant domain of Mr = 72,000 that contains the spectrin-binding activity and domains of Mr = 95,000 (brain ankyrin) or 90,000 (erythrocyte ankyrin) that contain binding sites for both tubulin and the anion channel. Brain ankyrin is present at about 100 pmol/mg of membrane protein in demyelinated membranes based on radioimmunoassay with antibody raised against brain ankyrin and affinity purified on brain ankyrin-agarose. Brain spectrin tetramers are present at 30 pmol/mg of membrane protein. Brain ankyrin thus is present in sufficient amounts to attach spectrin to membranes. Brain ankyrin also may attach microtubules to membranes independently of spectrin and has the potential to interconnect microtubules and spectrin-associated actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W2029291655,"Two functionally different types of human T-cell clones, one with helper function and two with specific activity, were infected with different isolates of HTLV-I and HLTV-II. Both types of human T cells showed alterations in specific function after infection with either of the HTLV subgroups. Before HTLV infection, the T-cell clone with helper function proliferates and provides help to B cells only in the presence of both a specific soluble antigen (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) and histocompatible antigen-presenting cells. After HTLV infection, these cells respond with increased proliferation and indiscriminant stimulation of polyclonal immunoglobulin production by B cells, regardless of the histocompatibility of the antigen-presenting cells or the presence of the soluble antigen. Infection of the normal cytotoxic T-cell clones led to a dimunition or loss of the cytotoxic function. The results of these studies suggest some possible mechanisms for induction of immune deficiency and of polyclonal B-cell activation by viruses of the HTLV family."
https://openalex.org/W1984960922,Rearrangement in the c-myb locus of each of four independently derived BALB/c plasmacytoid lymphosarcoma (ABPL's) is due to the insertion of a defective Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) into a 1.5-kilobase-pair stretch of cellular DNA at the 5' end of the v-myb-related sequences. This retroviral insertion is associated with abnormal transcription of myb sequences and probably represents a step in the neoplastic transformation of ABPL cells.
https://openalex.org/W1603634749,"The effect of transferrins on hydroxyl radical formation from the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide generated by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase system has been studied by EPR using 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide as a spin trap. Neither diferriclactoferrin nor diferrictransferrin were found capable of promoting hydroxyl radical formation via the Haber-Weiss reaction even in the presence of EDTA in concentrations up to 1 mM. Activity observed by other authors may have been due to the presence of extraneous iron or an active protein impurity. Partially saturated transferrin and lactoferrin present in normal subjects may protect cells from damage by binding iron that might catalyze hydroxyl radical formation from superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. In any event, the hydroxyl radical formation observed in active neutrophils during phagocytosis cannot be associated with lactoferrin activity."

https://openalex.org/W2102705401,"Delivery of iron to K562 cells by diferric transferrin involves a cycle of binding to surface receptors, internalization into an acidic compartment, transfer of iron to ferritin, and release of apotransferrin from the cell. To evaluate potential feedback effects of iron on this system, we exposed cells to iron chelators and monitored the activity of the transferrin receptor. In the present study, we found that chelation of extracellular iron by the hydrophilic chelators desferrioxamine B, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, or apolactoferrin enhanced the release from the cells of previously internalized 125I-transferrin. Presaturation of these compounds with iron blocked this effect. These chelators did not affect the uptake of iron from transferrin. In contrast, the hydrophobic chelator 2,2-bipyridine, which partitions into cell membranes, completely blocked iron uptake by chelating the iron during its transfer across the membrane. The 2,2-bipyridine did not, however, enhance the release of 125I-transferrin from the cells, indicating that extracellular iron chelation is the key to this effect. Desferrioxamine, unlike the other hydrophilic chelators, can enter the cell and chelate an intracellular pool of iron. This produced a parallel increase in surface and intracellular transferrin receptors, reaching 2-fold at 24 h and 3-fold at 48 h. This increase in receptor number required ongoing protein synthesis and could be blocked by cycloheximide. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid or desferrioxamine presaturated with iron did not induce new transferrin receptors. The new receptors were functionally active and produced an increase in 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-transferrin. We conclude that the transferrin receptor in the K562 cell is regulated in part by chelatable iron: chelation of extracellular iron enhances the release of apotransferrin from the cell, while chelation of an intracellular iron pool results in the biosynthesis of new receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1602914288,"D-myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate has been previously demonstrated to act as a second messenger for the hormonal mobilization of intracellular calcium in rat liver. In this study, the breakdown of D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate by a phosphatase activity was characterized. Using partially purified subcellular fractions, it was found that D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate phosphatase (I-P3ase) specific activity was highest in the plasma membrane fraction, while D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate phosphatase specific activity was highest in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. The plasma membrane I-P3ase was Mg2+-dependent with optimal activity observed at 0.5-1.5 mM free Mg2+. The enzyme had a neutral pH optimum, suggesting that it was neither an acid nor alkaline phosphatase. Neither LiCl nor NaF inhibited the I-P3ase activity. However, both L-cysteine and dithiothreitol stimulated the activity 2-fold. Spermine (2.0 mM) inhibited the I-P3ase activity by 50%, while putrescine and spermidine had little or no effect."

https://openalex.org/W2121495515,"The number of diferic transferrin receptors on HeLa cells decreases when cells are grown in iron-supplemented media. The experiments reported here suggest that heme is the iron-containing compound which serves as the signal for receptor number regulation. When HeLa cells were grown in the presence of hemin, transferrin receptor number decreased to a greater degree than when cells were grown in equivalent amounts of iron supplied as ferric ammonium citrate. Incubation of cells in conditions which increased cellular heme content resulted in a decrease in cellular transferrin receptors. Incubating cells with 5-aminolevulinic acid (thus bypassing the rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis, 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase) led to a decrease in transferrin receptor number. Incubation of cells with an inhibitor of heme oxygenase, Sn-protoporphyrin IX, also led to a decrease in transferrin receptor number. When cellular heme content was decreased by inhibiting heme synthesis with succinylacetone (an inhibitor of 5-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase), or by depriving cells of iron with deferoxamine, an increase in HeLa cell transferrin receptor number was seen. When HeLa cells were incubated with inducers of heme oxygenase (CoCl2, SnCl2, Co-protoporphyrin IX), transferrin receptor number also increased. The effects of all compounds which alter transferrin receptor number were dependent on the concentration of the supplement, as well as the duration of the supplementation. These experiments suggest that intracellular heme content may be an important signal controlling transferrin receptor number."
https://openalex.org/W1607292902,"The binding of [3H]cAMP to Dictyostelium discoideum cells was analyzed on a seconds time scale under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The binding of [3H]cAMP increases rapidly to a maximum obtained at about 6 s, which is followed by a decrease to an equilibrium value reached at about 45 s. This decrease of [3H]cAMP binding is not the result of ligand degradation or isotope dilution by cAMP secretion but is due to a transition of high-affinity binding to low-affinity binding. Analysis of the dissociation rate of [3H]cAMP from the binding sites indicates that these high- and low-affinity binding sites are both fast dissociating with a half-life of about 1 s. In addition, these dissociation experiments reveal a third binding type which is slowly dissociating with a half-life of about 15 s. The number and affinity of these slowly dissociating sites does not change during the incubation with [3H]cAMP. The drugs caffeine and chlorpromazine do not change the total number of binding sites, but they change the ratio of the three binding types. In the presence of 10 mM caffeine almost all binding sites are in the low affinity conformation, while in the presence of 0.1 mM chlorpromazine the ratio is shifted to both the high-affinity type and slowly dissociating type. The results indicate that the cAMP-binding activity of D. discoideum cells is heterogeneous. In the absence of cAMP about 4% of the sites are slowly dissociating with Kd = 12.5 nM, about 40% are fast dissociating with high affinity (Kd = 60 nM), and about 60% are fast dissociating with low affinity (Kd = 450 nM). During the binding reaction the number of slowly dissociating sites does not change. The number of high-affinity sites decreases to a minimum of about 10% with a concomitant increase of low-affinity sites to about 90%. This transition of binding types shows first-order kinetics with a half-life of about 9 s. A half-maximal transition is induced by 12.5 nM cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2067880031,"The patch-clamp technique was used to study passive movements of ions through the plasmalemma of wheat leaf protoplasts. This method overcomes the problems inherent in conventional electrophysiological study of plant cells. Changes in conductance were recorded in patches excised from the plasmalemma. Two types of patches were observed: (i) regions of low channel density, where discrete single-channel currents could be resolved and conductance ranged from 10 to 200 picosiemens and (ii) regions of high channel density, where single-channel currents could not be resolved and conductance was on the order of a few nanosiemens. The results indicate a striking similarity between animal and plant cell membranes in the basic phenomena of transport. Moreover, the approach used constitutes a new degree of refinement in the study of processes of regulation, pathology, and toxicity in plants."
https://openalex.org/W1569795562,"The three-dimensional crystal structure of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase complexed with fluoride (F- or HF) has been determined by difference Fourier techniques and partially refined at 2.5-A resolution. Fluoride binding induces significant perturbations of the enzyme structure of the distal side of the heme. The major effect occurs at the active-site arginine residue (Arg-48) which moves about 2 A in order to optimize hydrogen-bonded interactions with the fluorine atom. A small readjustment of the distal histidine (His-52), about 0.5 A, is also seen upon fluoride binding. Additionally, a hydrogen-bonded network of 4 water molecules at the active site is reorganized. No significant movements are detectable in either the heme itself or in the proximal histidine ligand. These observations imply that movement of the Arg-48 side chain may play a key role in the enzymic mechanism of cytochrome c peroxidase. Although we cannot unequivocally determine whether fluoride is bound as HF or F-, the hydrogen-bonding pattern around the ligand points to the protonated form. Structural comparison suggests that there is a difference between the tautomeric state of the imidazole side chain of the distal histidine in cytochrome c peroxidase and of the similarly positioned distal histidine in the globins. This difference accounts for the observation that cytochrome c peroxidase preferentially binds the protonated form of ligands, whereas the globins bind the anionic form. The tautomer indicated by the peroxidase structure is the one required for acid base catalysis (Poulos, T.L., and Finzel, B. C. (1984) in Peptide and Protein Reviews (Decker, M., ed) in press)."
https://openalex.org/W1542122204,"Chronic metabolic acidosis increased the Na+-H+ exchange activity in isolated renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Treatment altered the initial rate of Na+ uptake by increasing Vm (acidotic, 15.3 +/- 0.7 nmol of Na+ X mg-1 X 2 s-1; normal, 11.3 +/- 0.9 nmol of Na+ X mg-1 X 2 s-1), and not the apparent affinity KNa+ (acidotic, 10.2 +/- 0.5 mM; normal 10.2 +/- 0.6 mM). Metabolic acidosis resulted in the proportional increase in 1 mM Na+ uptake at every intravesicular pH measured. A positive cooperative effect on Na+ uptake was found with increased intravesicular acidity in vesicles from both normal and acidotic rats. When the data were analyzed by the Hill equation, it was found that metabolic acidosis did not change the n (acidotic, 1.33 +/- 0.13; normal, 1.43 +/- 0.07) or the K'H+ (acidotic, 0.27 +/- 0.05 microM; normal, 0.28 +/- 0.06 microM), but increased the apparent Vm (acidotic, 1.10 +/- 0.08 nmol of Na+ X mg-1 X 2 s-1; normal, 0.81 +/- 0.07 nmol of Na+ X mg-1 X 2 s-1). The uptake of Na+ in exchange for H+ in membrane vesicles from normal and acidotic animals was not influenced by membrane potential. We conclude that metabolic acidosis leads to either an increase in the number of functioning exchangers or an increase in the turnover rate of the limiting step in the exchange."
https://openalex.org/W1978182526,Intraperitoneal administration of insulin to control rats and to rats with pituitary stalk transections or with lesions of the median eminence resulted in increased plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) levels. The insulin-induced stimulation of ACTH release was blocked in both the control and lesioned animals by prior treatment with either the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol or the glucocorticoid analog dexamethasone. The direct application of insulin to primary cultures of the anterior pituitary did not evoke ACTH release or affect the maximal ability of corticotropin-releasing factor or epinephrine to stimulate ACTH secretion. The results suggest that insulin stimulates ACTH release by a mechanism in which catecholamines of peripheral origin act directly on the anterior pituitary.
https://openalex.org/W1508384599,"Rat liver 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase catalyzes exchange reactions between ADP and ATP and between fructose-6-P and fructose-2,6-P2 at histidyl residues. Limited proteolysis of the enzyme with thermolysin yielded an enzyme core with a subunit molecular weight of 35,000-38,000. This enzyme core had no kinase activity and a 2-fold activated bisphosphatase activity whose sensitivity to the product inhibitor fructose-6-P was unchanged. The thermolysin-treated enzyme also did not catalyze the fructose-6-P/fructose-2,6-P2 exchange reaction but did catalyze the ADP/ATP exchange. These results suggest that 1) the enzyme's reactions may be catalyzed at two active sites, 2) there are at least two fructose-6-P binding sites, 3) the fructose-6-P/fructose-2,6-P2 exchange is catalyzed only at the kinase site, and 4) inactivation of the exchange and kinase reactions by thermolysin digestion is due to the loss of the fructose-6-P binding site of the kinase. Also consistent with these conclusions was the finding that oxidation of the enzyme with ascorbate/Fe3+ or H2O2 resulted in complete loss of the kinase activity as well as the fructose-6-P/fructose-2,6-P2 exchange but did not affect the bisphosphatase activity or the ADP/ATP exchange. Dithiothreitol could completely reactivate the ascorbate/Fe3+-inactivated enzyme, suggesting that oxidation occurred at a sulfhydryl group(s) essential for fructose-6-P binding in the kinase reaction. In addition, the kinase and fructose-6-P/fructose-2,6-P2 exchange reactions were more sensitive to inactivation by diethylpyrocarbonate than was the bisphosphatase. The different responses of the kinase and bisphosphatase reactions to the action of these various protein-modifying agents and to thermolysin digestion support the existence of a separate site for each reaction and an essential role for sulfhydryl groups at the sugar-phosphate-binding site(s) of the kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1563159976,"We have reported in the preceding paper that human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells synthesize thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). In this paper, we evaluated the kinetics of secretion of the protein and the effects produced by the ionophore monensin and the glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin. Cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine and then chased after addition of excess unlabeled methionine. TBG appeared in the medium after 10 min, and 50% of the protein was secreted after 45 min. After 2 h, more than 85% of TBG had been released. The rate of secretion of TBG was much slower than that of albumin, 50% of which was secreted after 20 min. Monensin, 1 microM, caused a marked delay in TBG secretion, with 50% released after 80 min. After 2 h, less than 60% had been released and a plateau was approached. Endoglycosidase H (endo H) treatment of intracellular and secreted TBG showed no alteration in the rate of conversion of TBG oligosaccharide units from high-mannose type (endo H-sensitive) to complex type (endo H-resistant), thus suggesting that monensin impeded the exit of TBG from the Golgi apparatus without affecting the terminal glycosylation of the protein. Tunicamycin, 5 micrograms/ml, completely blocked glycosylation and markedly affected TBG secretion, almost doubling the time required for the secretion of 50% of the protein. The effect was specific for TBG, since it was not observed in the case of albumin. After 2 h, only 56% of the protein had been released. Analysis of intracellular and extracellular immunoprecipitated products revealed the presence of aggregates (Mr greater than 100,000). The lack of carbohydrates, although not preventing TBG secretion, had marked quantitative effects, and increased the susceptibility to aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W1483597188,"Biologic actions of insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are thought to be initiated by binding of peptides to tissues, followed by phosphorylation of specific hormone receptors. Both insulin and IGF bind to renal membranes, suggesting functional roles for these peptides in kidney. The present studies further characterize the interaction of multiplication-stimulating activity (MSA)/IGF II with its renal receptor. Specific binding of 125I-IGF II was measured in basolateral membranes isolated from proximal tubular cells of dog kidney. Binding was half-maximal at 10(-9) M MSA and was not inhibited by human growth hormone, IGF I, insulin, or anti-insulin receptor antibodies. Concentration-dependent MSA-stimulated phosphorylation of a Mr 135,000 protein band was demonstrated in autoradiograms of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels from basolateral membrane suspensions. Insulin increased phosphorylation of this band only in the presence of MSA, while a Mr 92,000 band was consistently phosphorylated with insulin alone. The phosphorylated Mr 135,000 band which had been solubilized with detergent from basolateral membranes was immunoprecipitated using serum from a patient with anti-insulin receptor antibodies suggesting that the band is the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor. This was supported by the demonstration of covalent cross-linkage of 125I-insulin to the Mr 135,000 band. We conclude that receptor-mediated MSA-stimulated phosphorylation of isolated basolateral membranes may reflect a process by which biological actions of IGF II are mediated in vivo. Our data suggest that insulin and IGF II may interact by regulating protein phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1486576380,"NS protein of vesicular stomatitis virus was shown to migrate with a mobility consistent with the molecular weight predicted from the published cDNA sequence on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent cetyltrimethylammonium bromide at low pH. Cyanogen bromide cleavage of NS protein produced a large acidic amino-terminal peptide, as predicted by the sequence, which contained the majority of the phosphate residues. However, analysis of tryptic peptides by high-performance liquid chromatography suggested that there may be inaccuracies in the sequence of the carboxyl terminus of the sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1495234535,"Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) synthesis by human hepatoma (Hep G2) cells was demonstrated by pulse labeling with [35S]methionine or [3H]mannose and subsequent immunoprecipitation in the medium or cell lysate. Secreted TBG was glycosylated and had the same apparent molecular weight in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as TBG purified from human serum. Pulse-chase experiments failed to show any precursor form intracellularly. Treatment of cells with the amino acid analogs, canavanine and thialysine, did not cause secretion of large-molecular-weight moieties, in contrast to what was observed in the case of albumin. Thyroxine-binding activity, as assessed by [125I]thyroxine immunoprecipitation with anti-TBG serum, was detectable in the media of oocytes injected with RNA from Hep G2 cells. Translation of this RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TBG serum, revealed a protein having the same electrophoretic mobility as deglycosylated TBG purified from human serum (Mr approximately 45,000). Since deglycosylated TBG still contains 3% of its weight as carbohydrate, it appears that the translation product contains an additional fragment (signal peptide) of about 1,500 daltons. It is unlikely, however, that TBG is synthesized via a larger-molecular-weight precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1603407026,"Rat intermediate pituitary cells in primary culture display a time-dependent loss of the ability to produce COOH-terminally alpha-amidated alpha MSH (Glembotski, C.C., Eipper, B.A., and Mains, R.E. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7299-7304). Instead of des-, mono-, and diacetyl-adrenocorticotropic hormone(ACTH) (1-13)NH2, the cells produce des-, mono-, and diacetyl-ACTH(1-14)OH. Since the pituitary secretory granule-associated alpha-amidation enzyme requires copper and ascorbic acid for optimal activity (Eipper, B.A., Mains, R.E., and Glembotski, C. C. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 5144-5148), these cofactors were added to cultures of intermediate pituitary cells in an attempt to reverse the loss of peptide alpha-amidation ability. When the cultures were supplemented with up to 100 microM cooper (II) there was very little change in the ability to alpha-amidate alpha-melanotropin. Ascorbic acid at concentrations of up to 500 microM resulted in a dramatic increase in the ability of the cells to form the alpha-amidated peptide. Various combinations of ascorbic acid and copper additions indicated that a relatively short exposure (hours) to ascorbic acid produced the maximal response. Ascorbic acid displayed a dose-dependent effect on the alpha-amidation ability with a half-optimal concentration of about 25 microM. Pulse-chase labeling experiments demonstrated the ascorbic acid-dependent conversion of labeled ACTH(1-14)OH-related peptides to ACTH(1-13)NH2-related peptides. These results correlate with the ascorbic acid requirement of the pituitary alpha-amidation enzyme and demonstrate that the direct precursors to ACTH(1-13)NH2-related peptides are ACTH(1-14)OH-related peptides. Combined with our previous data, the present studies support the notion that a wide range of neuro- and endocrine peptides become alpha-amidated in a similar ascorbic acid-dependent manner."

Incubation of the purified vaccinia RNA guanylyltransferase with [alpha- 32P]GTP and MgCl2 yields [32P]GMP covalently linked to the Mr = 95,000 subunit. The bond involves the phosphate moiety of GMP and the Ne-amino group of lysine. This was verified by treatment of the isolated 95-kDa subunit-[32P]GMP complex with sodium periodate, followed by methylamine-catalyzed beta-elimination. The product was then hydrolyzed by alkali producing 32P-labeled lysine (Ne-P)phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1516678679,"Effects of norepinephrine on gluconeogenesis and ureogenesis from glutamine by hepatocytes from fasted rats were assessed. Comparisons were made to asparagine metabolism and to the effects of NH4Cl and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. With asparagine as substrate, aspartate content was very high but norepinephrine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, or NH4Cl had little effect on gluconeogenesis or ureogenesis. Metabolism of asparagine could be greatly enhanced by the combination of oleate, ornithine, and NH4Cl. However, even under these conditions, asparatate content remained high, and norepinephrine and dibutyryl cyclic AMP had little influence on glucose or urea synthesis. With glutamine as substrate, aspartate content was much lower, but was greatly elevated by norepinephrine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, or NH4Cl. Each of these effectors strongly stimulated glucose and urea formation from glutamine. NH4Cl stimulation was accompanied by an increased glutamate and decreased alpha-ketoglutarate content. This suggests the mechanism for NH4Cl stimulation is a near-equilibrium adjustment to ammonia by glutamate dehydrogenase and aspartate aminotransferase rather than a principal involvement of glutaminase. Although both norepinephrine and dibutyryl cyclic AMP lowered alpha-ketoglutarate to the same extent, norepinephrine more rapidly increased aspartate content and led to a smaller accumulation of glutamate than did dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Moreover, only norepinephrine led to a rapid increase in succinyl-CoA concentration. The catecholamine effect could not be explained by specific changes in cytosolic or mitochondrial redox states. The results suggest that alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is a site of catecholamine action in rat liver. Since purified alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is known to be Ca2+ stimulated and Ca2+ flux is involved in catecholamine action, these findings also suggest that mitochondrial Ca2+ is elevated by catecholamines."
https://openalex.org/W1593412845,"Human plasma gelsolin, a 93,000-dalton actin-binding protein binds to human plasma fibronectin. Qualitative data obtained from experiments employing quasi-elastic light scattering, sucrose gradient sedimentation, gel filtration chromatography, and fibronectin polymerization indicate that gelsolin and fibronectin form a complex in solution. Solid-phase binding studies show that both human plasma and rabbit macrophage gelsolin bind to immobilized fibronectin with a Kd of about 1 microM in a 1:1 complex. The ability of gelsolin to interact with actin was not affected by the presence of fibronectin. Fibronectin also increased the amount of gelsolin binding to fibrin clots. Binding of gelsolin to fibronectin may serve to localize plasma gelsolin in regions where fibronectin is deposited, such as inflammatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1632018797,"DNA polymerases induced by herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 (KOS) and by three phosphonoformic acid-resistant strains were purified and the interaction of these enzymes with aphidicolin was examined. Incorporation of dATP, dCTP, and dTTP into activated DNA by parental enzyme was inhibited competitively by aphidicolin whereas dGTP incorporation was inhibited noncompetitively. Phosphonoformic acid-resistant enzymes were altered in KM and KI values for substrate and inhibitor, and two were inhibited by aphidicolin via the same modes as parental enzyme. However, aphidicolin competitively inhibited incorporation of dGTP by the third phosphonoformic acid-resistant enzyme under identical assay conditions. Two phosphonoformic acid-resistant enzymes were more sensitive than parental enzyme to inhibition by aphidicolin, indicating a close association between binding determinants for aphidicolin and for phosphonoformic acid on the virus DNA polymerase molecule. Aphidicolin inhibited hydrolysis of polynucleotide by HSV-1 DNA polymerase-associated nuclease. Inhibition was uncompetitive with DNA and the KI value (0.09 microM) was within the range of those calculated during nucleotide incorporation (0.071-0.74 microM). Therefore, aphidicolin may produce antiviral effects both by inhibition of deoxynucleotide incorporation and by deleterious effects resulting from inhibition of polymerase-associated nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1497443731,"The stereochemistry of the major isomer of 14,15-dihydroxy-5,8,10,12-eicosatetraenoic acid formed from 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid in human leukocytes was determined. The structure (erythro-14(R),15(S]-14,15-dihydroxy-5,8-cis-10,12-trans-eicosatetraenoi c acid) was assigned based on sodium arsenite thin-layer chromatography, NMR spectroscopy, and comparison with material prepared by total synthesis. This compound was found to inhibit leukotriene B4-induced superoxide anion generation in human neutrophils (IC50 = 10(-8)-10(-7) M). Superoxide anion generation induced by either formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine or arachidonic acid was not affected."
https://openalex.org/W1568680367,"Alkylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase with p-mercuribenzoate caused a rapid stimulation of the kinase and an inhibition of the bisphosphatase. At later times, the kinase activity also became inhibited. In contrast, treatment with N-ethylmaleimide abolished kinase activity but had no effect on the bisphosphatase. Selective modification of residues involved in the kinase reaction was also seen with iodoacetamide, which caused a 10-fold stimulation of the kinase Vmax without affecting the bisphosphatase. The stimulatory effect of carboxyamidomethylation was seen when the kinase was assayed in the presence of inorganic phosphate, an allosteric activator of the enzyme. The iodoacetamide-treated enzyme had a 10-20-fold higher Km for fructose 6-phosphate than the native enzyme and the Ki for fructose 2,6-bisphosphate was also increased. However, the adenine-nucleotide site did not seem to be affected since there was no change in the Km for ATP, the Ki for ADP, or the adenine-nucleotide exchange. There was also a direct correlation between the incorporation of [14C]acetamide into the enzyme and activation of the kinase. The residues modified by iodoacetamide were shown to be cysteines by the exclusive appearance of carboxymethylcysteine in protein hydrolysates. Activation was associated with alkylation of 2 cysteines/subunit, of the 12 which could be alkylated after denaturation/reduction. Iodoacetamide-activated kinase was inhibited by ascorbate/Fe3+, which has been shown to modify sulfhydryl groups in the native enzyme, with concomitant loss of kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1588138884,"Inhibition of (Na+ + K+)-dependent adenosine triphosphatase phosphatase by vanadate is thought to occur through the tight binding of vanadate to the same site from which Pi is released. To see if ATP binds to [48V] vanadate-enzyme complex, just as it does to the phosphoenzyme, the effects of Na+, K+, and ATP on the dissociation rate of the complex at 10 degrees C were studied. The rate constant was increased by Na+, and this increase was blocked by K+, indicating that either Na+ or K+ binds to the complex. ATP alone, or in combination with K+, had no effect on the rate constant. In the presence of Na+, however, ATP caused a further increase in the rate constant. The value of K0.5 of Na+ was the same in the presence or absence of ATP; K0.5 of ATP (0.2 mM) did not seem to change significantly when Na+ concentration was varied, and K0.5 of K+, at a constant Na+ concentration, was the same in the presence or absence of ATP. The data indicate that ATP binds to the enzyme-vanadate complex regardless of the presence or absence of Na+ or K+, but it affects the dissociation rate only when Na+ is bound simultaneously. The value of K0.5 of Na+ decreased as pH was increased in the range of 6.5-7.8, but K0.5 of ATP was independent of pH. Demonstration of ATP binding to the enzyme-vanadate complex provides further support for the suggestion that the oligomeric enzyme contains a low-affinity regulatory site for ATP that is distinct from the interacting high-affinity catalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1516153383,"To examine the kinetics of opioid receptor binding, the agonists [D-Ala2-D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADL) and [D-Ala2-MePhe4-Gly-ol5]enkephalin (DAGO) and the antagonists diprenorphine and naltrexone were used with bovine hippocampal synaptic plasma membranes. By computer modeling of equilibrium binding displacement curves utilizing the LIGAND program, we found opioid peptides bind with high affinity to single populations of synaptic plasma membranes receptors, whereas opiate alkaloids bind to multiple sites. Initial kinetic experiments revealed that agonist rates of association were radioligand concentration-independent. Pseudo first-order rate constants for DADL, DAGO, diprenorphine, and naltrexone association were estimated to be 5.63 X 10(5), 5.08 X 10(5), 4.60 X 10(6), and 2.3 X 10(6) mol-1 X s-1, respectively. After preincubation of 0.2-1 nM radioligand for variable time intervals, dissociation was initiated by addition of 1 microM unlabeled ligand. If saturation binding was achieved before dissociation was initiated, then nearly monophasic dissociation of DADL, DAGO, and diprenorphine and a biphasic off-rate for naltrexone were observed. When association times were reduced to pre-equilibrium intervals, the kinetics of dissociation of agonists became biphasic and association time-dependent, but that for antagonists did not change significantly. Comparisons by both graphical methods and computerized nonlinear regression analyses of rate constants revealed that the fraction of the rapid component of agonist dissociation decreases and that of the slow component is elevated with increasing receptor occupancy. In the presence of 100 mM NaCl, DADL dissociation became association time-independent. These data are consistent with the idea that the Na+ effect is brought about by a change of receptor to an antagonist-like conformation. On the basis of both association and dissociation kinetic data, opioid agonists appear to interact in a multistep process in which a rapid, reversible association is followed by the formation of a more tightly bound complex."
https://openalex.org/W1528194621,"An accelerated degradation of phospholipid is the likely basis of irreversible cell injury in ischemia, and the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver are a convenient system with which to study the effect of such a disturbance on the structure and function of cellular membranes. In the present report, electron spin resonance spectroscopy has been used to evaluate changes in the molecular ordering of microsomal membrane phospholipids in the attempt to relate the loss of lipid to alterations in membrane structure. The order parameter, S, was calculated from spectra reflecting the anisotropic motion of 12-doxyl stearic acid incorporated into normal and 3-h ischemic microsomal membranes. Over the temperature range 4-40 degrees C, the molecular order (S) of ischemic membranes was increased by 8-10%. This increase was reproduced in the ordering of the phospholipids in liposomes prepared from total lipid extracts of the same membranes. In contrast, after removal of the neutral lipids, liposomes prepared from phospholipids of ischemic and control membranes had the same molecular order. There were no differences in the phospholipid species of control and ischemic membranes or in the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids. In the neutral lipid fraction of ischemic membranes, however, triglycerides and cholesterol were increased compared to control preparations. There were no free fatty acids. The total cholesterol content of the liver was unchanged after 3 h of ischemia. The cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio of ischemic membranes, however, was increased by 22% from 0.258 to 0.315 as a consequence of the loss of phospholipid. Addition of cholesterol to the control total lipid extracts to give a cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio the same as in ischemic membranes resulted in liposomes with order parameters similar to those of liposomes prepared from ischemic total lipids. It is concluded that the degradation of the phospholipids of the microsomal membrane results in a relative increase in the cholesterol-to-phospholipid ratio. This is accompanied, in turn, by an increased molecular order of the residual membrane phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1576512927,"The primary effect of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) at the cytochrome b-c1 region of the respiratory chain of rat liver mitochondria is an inhibition of proton translocation. No significant decrease was observed in the rate of electron flow from succinate to cytochrome c when measured as cytochrome c reductase, K3Fe(CN)6 reductase, or the rate of H+ release in the presence of the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone after treatment with sufficient DCCD to abolish completely electrogenic proton ejection. The inhibitory effects of DCCD were time and concentration dependent and affected by the pH of the medium. Lowering the pH from 7.3 to 6.7 resulted in a progressively faster rate and extent of inhibition of proton ejection by DCCD. At pH 6.9, the H+/2e- decreased by 50% within 30 s after DCCD addition; however, at pH 7.3, a 50% decrease was not observed until 2 min after DCCD addition. DCCD did not act as an uncoupler as both the rate of proton ejection and back decay were decreased after incubation with DCCD. Treatment of rat liver mitochondria with DCCD under these same conditions also resulted in a broadening of the sharp spectral shift of cytochrome b observed after antimycin addition to mitochondria previously reduced with succinate suggesting that DCCD may modify cytochrome b in such a way that the binding of antimycin is altered."
