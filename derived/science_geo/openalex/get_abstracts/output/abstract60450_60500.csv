https://openalex.org/W1580419443,"Abstract An electron density map of the oxidized form of flavodoxin from Clostridium strain MP has been calculated to a resolution of 1.9 A employing isomorphous and anomalous scattering data from two heavy atom derivatives, Smiii and Aui. In the region from 3.0 to 1.9 A, the largest structure amplitudes (85% of the total | F | s) have been included in the computation. The over-all figure of merit is 0.808. The molecular model resulting from interpretation of this map has a chain length of 138 residues, in accord with the sequence (Tanaka, M., Haniu, M., Yasunobu, K. T., and Mayhew, S. G. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4393–4396). As reported earlier, the molecule possesses a high degree of secondary structure, including a central parallel sheet and four helices. More than 70% of the residues appear to participate in backbone hydrogen bonding. Atomic coordinates, incorporating the sequence data, have been optimized by use of Diamond's model-building program. The flavin mononucleotide prosthetic group adopts a somewhat extended conformation. As expected for the oxidized state, the isoalloxazine ring is planar. It is partly shielded from solvent by a tryptophan residue and interacts on its inner surface with methionine. Protein atoms are also in appropriate positions for interaction with atoms N-1, O-2, and N-3 of the flavin ring, but N-5 appears too far removed to form a hydrogen bond with the apoprotein. The ribityl phosphate moiety also makes multiple contacts with protein groups. Two of the three O' oxygens are in positions where they may participate in hydrogen bonding; the phosphate is closely surrounded by four hydroxyamino acids and four backbone NH groups. However, the prosthetic group is accessible on one side to solvent. Peaks likely to represent solvent can be observed near the dimethylbenzene end of the isoalloxazine ring and adjacent to the 3'-ribityl oxygen. While the mutual arrangement of protein and ribityl phosphate is nearly identical with that found by Watenpaugh et al. (Watenpaugh, K. D., Sieker, L. C., Jensen, L. H., LeGall, J., and Dubourdieu, M. (1972) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 3185–3188) in Desulfovibrio vulgaris flavodoxin, the orientation and interactions of the flavin ring differ strikingly in the two flavodoxins. The structure of the oxidized form of Clostridium MP flavodoxin is very similar to that deduced earlier for the semiquinone form at 3.25 A, despite large differences in the x-ray intensities (Ri = 0.66)."
https://openalex.org/W1510807601,"Abstract Removal of zinc from thermolysin results in an inactive, metal-free apoenzyme. Zn2+, Co2+, and Mn2+, when added in stoichiometric amounts, restore 100, 200, and 10% of the activity of the native enzyme. Fe2+ in high molar excess restores about 60% of the native activity. Zinc is bound much more firmly than is cobalt, as shown by mutual displacement and the resultant enzymatic activities. Zinc in excess of that required to induce activity inhibits the enzyme, seemingly by binding to a specific, inhibitory site. The zinc atom does not seem to contribute to the stability of the protein toward heat denaturation. Chelating agents, e.g. 1,10-phenanthroline, inhibit native thermolysin by competing with the enzyme for its zinc atom and removing it. The inhibition is fully reversible on dilution or on addition of Zn2+ ions and is a function of concentrations of enzyme and chelating agents. The enzymatically active cobalt thermolysin exhibits absorption and circular dichroic spectra indicative of an unusual environment of the cobalt atom. There is a shoulder near 500 nm and a maximum at 555 nm (e ∼90). These data together with spectral perturbations of the CD, magnetic circular dichroic, and absorption spectra lead to the conclusion that the cobalt atom is coordinated in a distorted tetrahedral geometry. This deduction is consistent both with those other cobalt-substituted zinc enzymes which exhibit similarly unusual properties as compared with Co(II) complex ions and with interpretations of x-ray structure analysis of native thermolysin."

https://openalex.org/W1481156525,"Abstract A single basic polypeptide was found to be the main chemical constituent of the characteristic cytoplasmic granules of Plasmodium lophurae. When sonicated suspensions of parasites (freed from host erythrocytes) were centrifuged through 1.7 m sucrose, the resulting pellet on examination by electron microscopy showed only a mixture of the granules and contaminating hemozoin (malarial pigment). The granules could be extracted completely with 0.9 n acetic acid either after removal of hemozoin with 0.1 n NaOH or directly from the sucrose pellet. Only hemozoin was left as residue in the latter case. The acid extracts from both procedures subjected to electrophoresis gave a single band on polyacrylamide gels. In 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, the polypeptide eluted as a single peak from a calibrated Sephadex G-200 column at an estimated molecular weight of 35,000 to 40,000. The soluble polypeptide reaggregated into granules on dialysis in slightly alkaline buffers. The amino acid analysis of the polypeptide showed a most unusual composition with five amino acids accounting for 95% of the total mole ratio: 73% histidine, 7.5% proline, 7% alanine, 6% glutamic acid, and 2.1% aspartic acid. The polypeptide accounts for about 11% of the dry weight of multinucleate and 3% of uninucleate malaria trophozoites."

This abrasive surface is used for rapid, precise, and reliable beveling of Pyrex micropipettes with tip diameters at least as small as 0.1 micrometer.

https://openalex.org/W1524219549,"Abstract A method has been developed for the rapid isolation of human phosphoglucose isomerase by substrate-induced elution from phosphocellulose. The high degree of selectivity of the elution provides homogeneous, crystalline enzyme from erythrocytes with a 30,000-fold purification and an overall yield of approximately 70%. A genetic variant form of the enzyme (Singh variant) has also been isolated from erythrocytes of an individual heterozygous for this rare allele. The physical, chemical, and catalytic properties of the normal wild type phosphoglucose isomerase have been compared with those of the variant protein. Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation showed that both the wild type and variant enzymes are of identical molecular weights (wild type, 132,000 ± 2,000; Singh variant, 131,000 ± 3,000) and are dimers composed of identical subunits. Although the wild type isomerase electrofocused as a single component with an isoelectric pH of 9.25, the enzyme isolated from the Singh variant erythrocytes was resolved into the wild type homodimer (pI 9.25), the mixed heterodimer (pI 9.40), and the variant homodimer (pI 9.57). The wild type and variant homodimers were S-carboxymethylated, and the lysine residues carbamylated with potassium cyanate. Following tryptic digestion, peptide maps revealed a single altered peptide from the variant isomerase. The amino acid substitution in the variant is believed to be an acidic → neutral replacement. This substitution has no effect on the catalytic properties of the enzyme. However, the variant homodimer is more stable toward heat or treatment with a variety of denaturants such as guanidine hydrochloride, urea, or sodium dodecyl sulfate than is than is the wild type enzyme. Thus, while the point mutation does not affect the binding of substrates or inhibitors, it has a readily measurable effect on the over-all stability of the protein. The increased stability of the variant may account for the increased levels of phosphoglucose isomerase activity measured in blood from individuals heterozygous for this genetic phenotype."

https://openalex.org/W1509905456,Abstract A gel chromatographic analytical procedure using Bio-Gel A-0.5m in 6 m guanidine HCl-0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol has been developed and standardized. The procedure permits the molecular weight of peptides in the size range of 2 to 146 amino acids in length to be established from the distribution coefficient of the peptide on the gel column. This procedure has been applied to an analysis of the size distribution of nascent peptides from rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes. These studies indicate that the size distribution of nascent peptides is nonuniform and that translation of hemoglobin messenger RNA molecules does not proceed at a constant rate in the reticulocyte.

https://openalex.org/W1507608083,"Abstract The amino acid sequence of Clostridium strain MP flavodoxin was determined by partial use of manual and automated Edman degradation of S-β-carboxymethylcysteinylflavodoxin, of the cyanogen bromide fragments of the protein, of the tryptic peptides, and of the thermolysin-derived peptides of these starting materials. The sequence was determined to be: Met-Lys-Ile-Val-Tyr-Trp-Ser-Gly-Thr-Gly-Asn-Thr-Glu-Lys-Met-Ala-Glu-Leu-Ile-Ala-Lys-Gly-Ile-Ile-Glu-Ser-Gly-Lys-Asp-Val-Asn-Thr-Ile-Asn-Val-Ser-Asp-Val-Asn-Ile-Asp-Glu-Leu-Leu-Asn-Glu-Asp-Ile-Leu-Ile-Leu-Gly-Cys-Ser-Ala-Met-Gly-Asp-Glu-Val-Leu-Glu-Glu-Ser-Glu-Phe-Glu-Pro-Phe-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ile-Ser-Thr-Lys-Ile-Ser-Gly-Lys-Lys-Val-Ala-Leu-Phe-Gly-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Gly-Asp-Gly-Lys-Trp-Met-Arg-Asp-Phe-Glu-Glu-Arg-Met-Asn-Gly-Tyr-Gly-Cys-Val-Val-Val-Glu-Thr-Pro-Leu-Ile-Val-Gln-Asn-Glu-Pro-Asp-Glu-Ala-Glu-Gln-Asp-Cys-Ile-Glu-Phe-Gly-Lys-Lys-Ile-Ala-Asn-Ile-COOH.

The variant simultaneously affects the mobility of the lysosomal and microsomal forms of the enzyme. The difference is inherited as a single gene mapping at the position of the structural gene on chromosome 5. This confirms that beta-glucuronidase at both intracellular sites is coded by the same structural gene.

At the same time the concentrations of these substances in the cord above the lesion and that of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cisternal fluid was not significantly altered. Since high concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid are present in the human lumbosacral cord, it appears that the concentration of 5-hydroxyincdoleacetic acid in the lumbar fluid of animals and man reflects the biochemical changes of 5-hydroxytryptamine in the spinal cord."

In particular, interest in cytoplasmic DNA synthesis in eukaryotic cells has been limited to semiautonomous structures which contain DNA templates. But it was pointed out1 as early as 1958 that transfer of genetic information between DNA, RNA and protein often can proceed in either direction. It is possible that an initial step of DNA synthesis, corresponding for example to RNA-primed synthesis of Okazaki fragments2,3, may generally occur out of cell nuclei and without direct participation of a DNA template."
https://openalex.org/W2018389391,This paper reviews the current immigration policy and the effects of that policy on demographic and economic characteristics of recent immigrants. The quality of the data on immigration is also discussed. The Immigration Act of 1965 introduced major changes into immigration policy such as the elimination of the national origins system and the making of family reunions a major goal of immigration policy. The age structure stage in the family life cycle and other socioeconomic variables are related to the fertility of the immigrants and their offspring and thus have a long-term impact on population size and composition. Data on annual immigrants are collected tabulated and published by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the Department of Justice. The US has not collected emigration data since 1958. Estimates are made by the Bureau of the Census from reports of countries receiving the US emigrants. Data on immigrants who have left the US is also missing. The foreign-born women have recently had lower fertility rates than native-born women. The number and characteristics of immigrants have to be taken into account in population projections and estimates and social demographic and political implications need to be investigated and weighed in the formulation of policy. Better immigration data are needed however to achieve this goal.

https://openalex.org/W2087347714,"The population changes in San Jose and St. Louis between 1960 and 1970 exemplify the two broad trends-urban formation followed by metropolitan dispersal-that have shaped 20th-century urbanization in this country. The fact that these developmental trends were expressed through demographic processes found to be common to both cities, despite their contrasting recent experiences, suggests that generalizations can be made about the complex forces underlying urbanization. The formation of metropolitan San Jose's population parallels the traditional process whereby a region's growth comes to be focused, through migration, on a few urban centers. The modern variant is not characterized by a rural-to-urban shift, however, but by migration flows among urban areas, and particularly to a few most-favored areas, such as San Jose. Migratory growth has left a powerful demographic legacy in San Jose. This legacy is also instructive for studying the migratory formation of any new city's population. Its demographic character determines its demographic destiny, whose likely variations we can now perceive with some clarity. San Jose's population is both youthful and chronically migratory. The presence of many prospective parents and relatively few elderly persons lays a broad foundation for the population's continued growth through natural increase, despite the national downturn in fertility (14). Even without further net in-migration, the population of new cities like San Jose would continue to grow at an above-average rate. The hypermobility of San Jose's population (that is, its propensity for further migration) also has an important bearing on the future. With about 21 migrants entering and 17 departing each year per hundred residents, San Jose's rapid migratory growth rests (as it would in other new cities) on a precarious arithmetic balance. A significant dip in local employment growth could easily reduce net migration to a small fraction of its present high level. Even a slight decline would result in the inflow's no longer exceeding the high volume of outflow. Demographic analysis alone cannot foresee such an employment downturn, but if it happened, the migratory downturn probably would be swift. Hypermobility also works the other way; and given San Jose's focal position in California's expanding metropolitan structure (with its virtually endless supply of migratory growth), net migration could resume with equal swiftness. The outward dispersal of population from central cities that has occurred in St. Louis has been accelerating in other cities as well, and will remain a prominent feature of U.S. urban growth. It may seem paradoxical that in a period noted for something called ""urban growth"" there are so many declining central cities, but that is merely one indication that the ""central city"" no longer is the real city, except in name. Real city or not, the central city can expect to come into political conflict with other jurisdictions created in the process of dispersion. In cities like St. Louis, where population is dispersing but old political boundaries are fixed, the problems of the central city are separated from the resources in the suburbs. Transitional problems associated with persistent and severe outmigration also arise: accumulation of disadvantaged citizens, declining demand for city housing, and a diminished replacement capacity in the population. Carried far enough, the last of these problems results in natural decrease, and thereafter the population's decline acquires its own dynamic. As noted earlier, the white population in St. Louis has reached this point: The number of persons dying now exceeds the number being born. For two reasons, this natural decrease can do little other than intensify. First, a substantial proportion of whites are either entering or already within the high-mortality age brackets. The white population's crude death rate therefore will continue to rise. Second, prospective parents are becoming scarce among St. Louis's whites, and the national evidence that parents in general will choose to have smaller families continues to mount. The white population's crude birth rate is therefore likely to fall, barring a dramatic increase in fertility or a strong and sustained inflow of childbearing families. Nor is St. Louis's black population likely to grow substantially. It is expanding steadily through natural increase, but black migration out of the city is more than enough to cancel that increase."

https://openalex.org/W1976650353,"WE have seen groups of small (4–5 mm long) grey flies belonging to the species Lipochaeta slossonae Coquillett, 1896, standing, shaking and apparently feeding, or flying for short distances on stretches of wet sandy beach in La Jolla, California and San Felipe, Mexico. When undisturbed, they walked sideways or stood and shook their bodies, diagonally forward and downward, and backwards and upwards, at an estimated frequency of 5 s−1. We guessed that they were fluidising the wet sand under their feet and thereby loosening some of the interstitial microflora which could then be sucked up as a kind of soup. This was confirmed by laboratory examination of the guts of several specimens, which contained the remains of large numbers of cells of dinoflagellates and diatoms. (The species of dinoflagellates were unfortunately unidentifiable since there were no cell wall remains, but they probably belonged to the genus Amphidinium, which comprises some of the commonest unarmoured interstitial dinoflagellates on this beach. The diatom species, however, could be readily identified by their silica walls. There were at least 10 genera, all typical of the marine interstitial community, including various species of Navicula, Nitzschia, Pinnularia and Amphora.)"
https://openalex.org/W2022063592,AN interesting feature which has emerged from attempts to hybridise domestic sheep (Ovis aries) and goats (Capra hircus) is the marked difference in conception rate according to the direction in which the cross is made. In goats inseminated with sheep semen the conception rate is similar to that in goats mated naturally with male goats; whereas in sheep inseminated with goat semen fertilisation is an infrequent occurrence1–3. The low fertilisation rate in sheep inseminated with goat semen has been confirmed by Hancock4 who found that only 5 of 93 (5.4%) sheep eggs were fertilised by goat spermatozoa.
