https://openalex.org/W2158831156,"Suitably brief pulses of selectively absorbed optical radiation can cause selective damage to pigmented structures, cells, and organelles in vivo. Precise aiming is unnecessary in this unique form of radiation injury because inherent optical and thermal properties provide target selectivity. A simple, predictive model is presented. Selective damage to cutaneous microvessels and to melanosomes within melanocytes is shown after 577-nanometer (3 x 10(-7) second) and 351-nanometer (2 x 10(-8) second) pulses, respectively. Hemodynamic, histological, and ultrastructural responses are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2053527204,"Glutathione, a tripeptide thiol found in virtually all cells, functions in metabolism, transport, and cellular protection. It participates in the reduction of disulfides and other molecules, and conjugates with compounds of exogenous and endogenous origin. It protects cells against the destructive effects of reactive oxygen intermediates and free radicals. Modifications of glutathione metabolism may be achieved by administration of selective enzyme inhibitors, and also by giving compounds that increase glutathione synthesis. Such effects are useful in chemotherapy and radiation therapy and in protecting cells against the toxic effects of drugs, other foreign compounds, and oxygen."

https://openalex.org/W1970823660,"We have induced the stable expression of muscle-specific genes in human nonmuscle cells. Normal diploid human amniocytes were fused with differentiated mouse muscle cells by using polyethylene glycol. The fusion product, a stable heterocaryon in which the parental cell nuclei remained distinct, did not undergo division and retained a full complement of chromosomes. This is in contrast with typical interspecific hybrids (syncaryons), in which the parental nuclei are combined and chromosomes are progressively lost during cell division. The human muscle proteins, myosin light chains 1 and 2, MB and MM creatine kinase and a functional mouse-human hybrid MM enzyme molecule were detected in the heterocaryons. Synthesis of these proteins was evident 24 hr after fusion and increased in a time-dependent manner thereafter. Our results indicate that differentiated mouse muscle nuclei can activate human muscle genes in the nuclei of a cell type in which they are not normally expressed, and that this activation occurs via the cytoplasm. The activators are still present in cells which have already initiated differentiation, are recognized by nuclei of another species, and do not diffuse between unfused cells. The reprogrammed amniocyte nuclei of stable heterocaryons provide a unique system in which to study the mechanisms regulating gene expression during cell specialization."
https://openalex.org/W2073883806,"Cultured hippocampal neurons, when exposed to cyanide or an anoxic atmosphere in the early stages of differentiation, were not visibly affected. However, neurons in the mature cultures died when exposed to cyanide or anoxia. Cell death could be prevented by treatment with magnesium, which eliminates synaptic activity. These observations suggest that damage in hypoxic neurons is mediated by synaptic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2026918336,"A simple and efficient method of covalently coupling the strong chelator diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to proteins was developed for radiolabeling immunoglobulin G antibodies. After being coupled and labeled with indium-111, a monoclonal antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen retained its ability to bind to its antigen in vitro and in vivo. In nude mice with a human colorectal xenograft, 41 percent of the injected radioactivity became localized in each gram of xenograft at 24 hours compared with 9 percent for control antibody and 19 percent for radioiodinated antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1983366569,"Perceptual sensitivity to a visual target presented in a random continuous sequence of targets and nontargets decreased rapidly over time when stimuli were highly degraded visually but not when moderately degraded or undegraded. Large declines in sensitivity, independent of changes in response criterion, were found after only 5 minutes of observation. These rapid decrements of sensitivity to degraded targets seem to result from demands on the limited capacity of visual attention."
https://openalex.org/W2074384162,"Human α-thrombin is a potent chemoattractant for human monocytes, with optimum activity occurring at about 10 nanomoles per liter. A variety of thrombins that were chemically modified to alter procoagulant or esterolytic functions showed a similar optimum activity, but complexes of prothrombin or α-thrombin with either antithrombin III or hirudin did not. These findings indicate that the regions in thrombin responsible for monocyte chemotaxis are proximate to those involved in certain protein recognition interactions of α-thrombin (for example, hirudin binding) but are distinct from the catalytic site and from certain exosites required for clotting."

https://openalex.org/W2049392123,"Pavlovian conditioning was used to teach rats an association between an arbitrary external cue and food. Presentation of the conditioned cue elicited feeding by sated animals. The meal constituted approximately 20 percent of daily intake, and it was compensated for by a reduction of subsequent intake."
https://openalex.org/W2085713021,"Hippocampal ablation has no effect on the acquisition of the rabbit's classically conditioned nictitating membrane response. Systemic administration of scopolamine, which alters hippocampal neuronal activity, severely retards acquisition of the conditioned response in normal animals and those with cortical ablations. In animals with hippocampal ablations, however, scopolamine has no effect on conditioning. These findings suggest that altered neuronal activity in the hippocampus is more detrimental to conditioning than removing the structure."
https://openalex.org/W2078717820,Ganglion cells of the terminal nerve in goldfish are located in the olfactory nerve and bulb and send peripheral processes into the olfactory epithelium and central processes to the supracommissural nuclei of the telencephalon as well as to the retina. Correlations between terminal nerve projections and neurobehavioral studies suggest that the terminal nerve mediates responses to sex pheromones.
https://openalex.org/W2083983934,"The antigen defined by a rat monoclonal antibody directed to a Burkitt lymphoma cell line was identified as globotriaosylceramide [Gal alpha (1 leads to 4)-Gal beta (1 leads to 4)-Glc beta (1 leads to 1)-ceramide]. The antibody demonstrated a strict steric specificity since it did not react with globoisotriaosylceramide [Gal alpha (1 leads to 3)-Gal beta (1 leads to 4)-Glc beta (1 leads to 1)-ceramide], the positional isomer of the antigen associated with the Burkitt lymphoma. Chemical analysis of various Burkitt lymphoma cell lines revealed that the Burkitt lymphoma cells contained more than 100 times as much of the glycolipid antigen as was found in other human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2023700110,"Plasma obtained from human subjects after exercise and injected intraperitoneally into rats elevated rat rectal temperature and depressed plasma iron and zinc concentrations. The pyrogenic component was heat-denaturable and had an apparent molecular weight of 14,000 daltons. Human mononuclear leukocytes obtained after exercise and incubated in vitro released a factor into the medium that also elevated body temperature in rats and reduced trace metal concentrations. These results suggest that endogenous pyrogen, a protein mediator of fever and trace metal metabolism during infection, is released during exercise."
https://openalex.org/W2024466568,"Socially stressed adult male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) fed a low fat, low cholesterol diet developed more extensive coronary artery atherosclerosis than unstressed controls. Groups did not differ in serum lipids, blood pressure, serum glucose, or ponderosity. These results suggest that psychosocial factors may influence atherogenesis in the absence of elevated serum lipids. Psychosocial factors thus may help explain the presence of coronary artery disease (occasionally severe) in people with low or normal serum lipids and normal values for the other ""traditional"" risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W2047519875,"Plant crown gall tumor cells result from the insertion and expression of a defined DNA sequence, called T-DNA, which is derived from the Ti plasmid, harbored by Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains. To study the function of the genes of the T-DNA of the nopaline Ti plasmid, pTiC58, a collection of mutants was isolated so that T-DNA genes are inactivated either separately or in various combinations. It was found that no single T-DNA gene or T-region border is absolutely essential for stable tumor formation. We have identified the gene responsible for synthesis in transformed cells of the phosphorylated sugar, agrocinopine, and at least three additional genes controlling the morphology of plant tumors. Two of these latter genes work together to inhibit shoot formation and ensure efficient tumorous growth. Inactivation of these genes can be suppressed by the addition of auxins. The third gene inhibits root formation and appears to play a role in the cytokinin-independent growth of transformed cells. Mutants missing all three genes do not induce tumors, nor shoot or root formation, although the mutant T-DNA sequence is transferred to plant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028769877,"Ethyl alcohol produced graded contractile responses in rat cerebral arterioles and venules in vivo and in isolated canine basilar and middle cerebral arteries at a concentration range (10 to 500 milligrams per deciliter) which parallels that needed for its graded effects of euphoria, mental haziness, muscular incoordination, stupor, and coma in humans. Two specific calcium antagonists, nimodipine and verapamil, prevented or reversed the alcohol-induced cerebrovasospasm and thus may prove valuable in treating the hypertension and stroke observed in heavy users of alcohol."
https://openalex.org/W2083212229,"Digoxin, the most widely used cardiac glycoside, undergoes significant metabolic conversion in many patients to cardioinactive metabolites in which the lactone ring is reduced. This appears to occur within the gastrointestinal tract. An attempt was made to isolate and identify the organisms capable of reducing digoxin from stool cultures obtained from human volunteers. Of hundreds of isolates studied, only Eubacterium lentum, a common anaerobe of the human colonic flora, converted digoxin to reduced derivatives. Such organisms were also isolated in high concentrations from the stools of individuals who did not excrete these metabolites when given digoxin in vivo. When the growth of E. lentum was stimulated by arginine, inactivation of digoxin was inhibited. Neither the presence of these organisms alone nor their concentration within the gut flora appeared to determine whether digoxin would be inactivated by this pathway in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2036100125,Cells in intermediate and deeper layers of the pigeon optic tectum respond best when a textured background pattern is moved in the opposite direction to a moving test spot. Complete inhibition occurs when the background moves in the same direction as the test stimulus. Most noteworthy is the invariance of this relationship over a wide range of test spot directions. These cells represent a higher level of abstraction in a motion-detecting system and may play a role in figure-ground segregation or the discrimination of the motion of an object from self-induced optical motion.
https://openalex.org/W1987688149,"Exposure to competitive mental tasks significantly reduced the urinary sodium and fluid excreted by young men with one or two hypertensive parents or with borderline hypertension. In this high-risk group, the degree of retention was directly related to the magnitude of heart rate increase during stress, suggesting common mediation by way of the sympathetic nervous system. Thus, psychological stress appears to induce changes in renal excretory functions that may play a critical role in long-term blood pressure regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2010587003,"The reticuloendothelial system of mice bearing EMT6 tumors was effectively blocked by intravenous injections of small unilamellar vesicles that incorporated a 6-aminomannose derivative of cholesterol in the lipid bilayer. Neutral liposomes loaded with indium-111-nitrilotriacetic acid were then injected. Fifty percent more radioactivity was deposited in tumors of the animals with blocked reticuloendothelial systems than in controls. Twenty-four hours after the injection of radioactive vesicles, well-defined tumor images were observed in whole-body gamma camera scintigraphs. Biodistribution studies showed that tumors from animals with blocked reticuloendothelial systems had more than twice the radioactivity per gram than any other tissue analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2001907141,"Technological hazards are evaluated in terms of quantitatively expressed physical, biological, and social descriptors. For each hazard a profile is constructed that considerably extends the conventional definition of risk. The profile, which is termed hazardousness, was understood in pilot experiments on perception and appeared to capture a large fraction of lay people's concern with hazard. It also suggests an orderly method for establishing priorities for the management of hazards."

https://openalex.org/W2061098985,"Spirochetes believed to be the cause of Lyme disease were isolated from white-footed mice and white-tailed deer, the preferred natural hosts of Ixodes dammini, the tick vector. Evidence suggests that deer act as a reservoir of the disease and provide an overwintering mechanism for both spirochetes and adult ticks. Some tick larvae may acquire the spirochete by transovarial passage and the nymphal stage may transmit the disease to humans."

https://openalex.org/W2059583451,Three-dimensional reconstruction of an asymmetric biological ultrastructure has been achieved by tomographic analysis of electron micrographs of sections tilted on a goniometer specimen stage. Aligned micrographs could be displayed as red-green three-dimensional movies. The techniques have been applied to portions of in situ transcription units of a Balbiani ring in the polytene chromosomes of the midge Chironomus tentans. Current data suggest a DNA compaction of about 8 to 1 in a transcription unit. Nascent ribonucleoprotein granules display an imperfect sixfold helical arrangement around the chromatin axis.
https://openalex.org/W1993138451,"A photoadduct is formed between the adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases of the deoxydinucleoside monophosphate d(TpA) when it is irradiated at 254 nanometers in aqueous solution. Treatment of the photoadduct with acid converts it specifically into a fluorescent hydrolysis product, C7H7N3O, incorporating the position-8 carbon of adenine and the methyl group of thymine. Isolation of the fluorescent hydrolysis product from acid hydrolyzates of oligo- and polydeoxyribonucleotides has shown that the photoadduct is formed by ultraviolet irradiation of d(pTpA), d(TpApT), d(TpApTpA), poly(dA-dT), and both single- and double-stranded DNA."

The minimum interval between dot onsets yielding this apparent motion increased not with the direct distance between the dots but, linearly, with the length of the curved path."

https://openalex.org/W2058079844,"The existence of low-level filtering of sensory input is a point of debate among cognitive theorists. This present study suggests that filtering by modality exists at levels low enough to modulate the brainstem blink reflex and that it is evident as early as the 16th week of life. During foreground listening or looking conditions, blinks elicited by acoustic or visual probes were larger when probe and foreground modality matched than when they mismatched. ""Interesting"" foregrounds, by comparison with ""dull"" ones, intensified the modality-selective effect."
https://openalex.org/W2059543210,"Brief deprivation of vision after unilateral lesions of the frontal eye field prevents the appearance of contralateral inattention to visual, auditory, and somatosensory stimuli. The forced circling that accompanies inattention, however, is not affected. An equivalent preoperative period in the dark only partly reduces inattention symptoms. Visual deprivation does not reduce or prevent inattention resulting from lesions of the superior colliculus."
https://openalex.org/W1990880601,"Crystalline cholesterol undergoes a phase transition a few degrees below human body temperature. The high-temperature form has an unusually complex structure with 16 independent molecules. In the transition two molecules change side chain conformation, four reorient about their long axes, and ten remain unchanged. The transition mechanism implies relatively nonspecific intermolecular interactions, qualitatively consistent with the behavior of cholesterol in biomembranes. The transition preserves a remarkably closely obeyed pseudosymmetry present in the structure."

https://openalex.org/W2029064831,"Monkeys in which nerves innervating the flexor muscles of the forearm and hand (the ulnar or the median nerve) had been surgically cross-united with the nerve innervating the extensor muscles (the radial nerve), and vice versa, showed excellent (ulnar-radial crosses) to moderate (median-radial crosses) control of movement performance after regeneration. Antagonistic movement responses were seen occasionally, but these were corrected almost immediately. Stimulation of the crossed nerves showed that they had innervated the antagonistic muscle groups. The results reveal the capacity of the primate central nervous system to adapt to gross disturbances imposed on the execution of movements by changes in peripheral innervation."
https://openalex.org/W2091026645,"Resonance Raman spectra of photolyzed carbonmonoxyhemoglobin obtained with 10-nanosecond pulses are compared with the spectra of photolyzed carbonmonoxyhemoglobin stabilized at 80 K. In comparing the deoxy with the photodissociated species, the changes in the Raman spectra are the same for these two experimental regimes. These results show that at ambient and cryogenic temperatures the heme pocket in liganded hemoglobin is significantly different from that of deoxyhemoglobin. It is concluded that measurements of the properties of intermediate species from photodissociated hemoglobin stabilized at low temperatures can be used to probe the short-lived metastable forms of hemoglobin present after photodissociation under biologically relevant solution conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2004598482,"The human parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense grew continuously at 37 degrees C in primary cultures of murine bone marrow. Cultured parasites remained virulent for mice. Rapid parasite growth coincided with the appearance of adherent adipocyte-epitheloid cell aggregates that also promoted hematopoiesis. This culture system should permit studies of host cell control of trypanosome proliferation, pathogenic effects of trypanosomes on blood cell development, and the relative trypanocidal and marrow suppressive activities of drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2074314257,"Glucose given to the newborn human may result in hyperglycemia, suggesting that its utilization is impaired at this developmental stage. Galactose is thought to be a more appropriate carbohydrate source for the newborn. The enzymes involved in hexose phosphorylation may, in part, be responsible for these observations. A key regulatory enzyme of hepatic glucose assimilation, glucokinase, is diminished in newborns compared to adults, whereas galactokinase activity is increased. When newborn dogs were fasted and then fed either glucose or galactose, their plasma insulin responses to glucose were similar, but the pups fed galactose demonstrated an attenuated systemic appearance rate of glucose. Hexose incorporation into hepatic glycogen and net glycogen synthesis was augmented in the galactose-fed dogs. In vitro, liver from neonatal dogs showed enhanced galactokinase activity relative to that for hexokinase or glucokinase. Neonatal hexose assimilation may be independent of insulin action and, instead, be related to the developmental presence of hexose phosphorylating enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2066305304,"Electric fields were found to deform sickled erythrocytes. When the intensity of applied fields exceeded a threshold value, sickled erythrocytes transformed into a spherical shape. Prolonged application of the field usually caused hemolysis of erythrocytes. Deformation of red blood cells could be partly reversed if the field was turned off at an early stage. The cause of desickling may be the interaction of the field with the erythrocyte membrane and also with gelled intracellular hemoglobin S molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2031174586,"Compared to nonpregnant controls, pregnant mice injected with phenobarbital had lower concentrations of the drug in the plasma but equivalent concentrations in the brain. In spite of the similar concentrations in the brain, the behavioral response to phenobarbital was greater for pregnant than nonpregnant mice. These results suggest that the concentration of phenobarbital in the plasma, which is commonly used as a basis for adjusting phenobarbital dosage during pregnancy, is not an appropriate indicator of the dynamics of the drug."
