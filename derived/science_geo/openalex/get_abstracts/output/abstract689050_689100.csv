https://openalex.org/W4213138979,"Many industrial chemicals that are produced from fossil resources could be manufactured more sustainably through fermentation. Here we describe the development of a carbon-negative fermentation route to producing the industrially important chemicals acetone and isopropanol from abundant, low-cost waste gas feedstocks, such as industrial emissions and syngas. Using a combinatorial pathway library approach, we first mined a historical industrial strain collection for superior enzymes that we used to engineer the autotrophic acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum. Next, we used omics analysis, kinetic modeling and cell-free prototyping to optimize flux. Finally, we scaled-up our optimized strains for continuous production at rates of up to ~3 g/L/h and ~90% selectivity. Life cycle analysis confirmed a negative carbon footprint for the products. Unlike traditional production processes, which result in release of greenhouse gases, our process fixes carbon. These results show that engineered acetogens enable sustainable, high-efficiency, high-selectivity chemicals production. We expect that our approach can be readily adapted to a wide range of commodity chemicals. Two industrial chemicals are sustainably produced at large scale by microbial gas fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W4213112325,"Understanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and protein function is a long-standing challenge with far-reaching scientific and translational implications. State-of-the-art alignment-based techniques cannot predict function for one-third of microbial protein sequences, hampering our ability to exploit data from diverse organisms. Here, we train deep learning models to accurately predict functional annotations for unaligned amino acid sequences across rigorous benchmark assessments built from the 17,929 families of the protein families database Pfam. The models infer known patterns of evolutionary substitutions and learn representations that accurately cluster sequences from unseen families. Combining deep models with existing methods significantly improves remote homology detection, suggesting that the deep models learn complementary information. This approach extends the coverage of Pfam by >9.5%, exceeding additions made over the last decade, and predicts function for 360 human reference proteome proteins with no previous Pfam annotation. These results suggest that deep learning models will be a core component of future protein annotation tools. A deep learning model predicts protein functional annotations for unaligned amino acid sequences."
https://openalex.org/W4226280654,"High-throughput functional characterization of genetic variants in their endogenous locus has so far been possible only with methods that rely on homology-directed repair, which are limited by low editing efficiencies. Here, we adapted CRISPR prime editing for high-throughput variant classification and combined it with a strategy that allows for haploidization of any locus, which simplifies variant interpretation. We demonstrate the utility of saturation prime editing (SPE) by applying it to the NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1 gene (NPC1), mutations in which cause the lysosomal storage disorder Niemann-Pick disease type C. Our data suggest that NPC1 is very sensitive to genetic perturbation, with 410 of 706 assayed missense mutations being classified as deleterious, and that the derived function score of variants is reflective of diverse molecular defects. We further applied our approach to the BRCA2 gene, demonstrating that SPE is translatable to other genes with an appropriate cellular assay. In sum, we show that SPE allows for efficient, accurate functional characterization of genetic variants."
https://openalex.org/W4213140257,"DNA can determine where and when genes are expressed, but the full set of sequence determinants that control gene expression is unknown. Here, we measured the transcriptional activity of DNA sequences that represent an ~100 times larger sequence space than the human genome using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs). Machine learning models revealed that transcription factors (TFs) generally act in an additive manner with weak grammar and that most enhancers increase expression from a promoter by a mechanism that does not appear to involve specific TF-TF interactions. The enhancers themselves can be classified into three types: classical, closed chromatin and chromatin dependent. We also show that few TFs are strongly active in a cell, with most activities being similar between cell types. Individual TFs can have multiple gene regulatory activities, including chromatin opening and enhancing, promoting and determining transcription start site (TSS) activity, consistent with the view that the TF binding motif is the key atomic unit of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W4212883490,"B cells, which are critical for intestinal homeostasis, remain understudied in ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study, we recruited three cohorts of patients with UC (primary cohort, n = 145; validation cohort 1, n = 664; and validation cohort 2, n = 143) to comprehensively define the landscape of B cells during UC-associated intestinal inflammation. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell IgH gene sequencing and protein-level validation, we mapped the compositional, transcriptional and clonotypic landscape of mucosal and circulating B cells. We found major perturbations within the mucosal B cell compartment, including an expansion of naive B cells and IgG+ plasma cells with curtailed diversity and maturation. Furthermore, we isolated an auto-reactive plasma cell clone targeting integrin αvβ6 from inflamed UC intestines. We also identified a subset of intestinal CXCL13-expressing TFH-like T peripheral helper cells that were associated with the pathogenic B cell response. Finally, across all three cohorts, we confirmed that changes in intestinal humoral immunity are reflected in circulation by the expansion of gut-homing plasmablasts that correlates with disease activity and predicts disease complications. Our data demonstrate a highly dysregulated B cell response in UC and highlight a potential role of B cells in disease pathogenesis. Multi-modal profiling reveals major alterations in colonic B cells in patients with ulcerative colitis, including reduced clonal diversity of plasma cells, and suggests that circulating gut-homing plasmablasts could serve as a biomarker for disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W4225992082,"Since Health care workers (HCWs) are at high occupational risk for COVID-19, they are prioritized for immunization. This study aimed to assess the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs and to identify its determinants. A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted between10 and 31 December 2020 among Lebanese HCWs. The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework. Multivariable logistic analyses were carried out to identify the factors associated with the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs. A total of 1800 HCWs have completed the survey. Around half (58.10%) of them were frontline HCWs and aged between (30–49) years old. Over two-thirds (67.33%) of the participants have received the seasonal influenza vaccine. The acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among surveyed HCWs was 58%. HCWs who were male (aOR = 1.99, 95% CI (1.41–2.80)), working in the frontlines (aOR = 1.61, 95% CI (1.17–2.21), and those who have received influenza vaccination for the current year (aOR = 1.38, 95% CI(0.99–1.92)) were more willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine. However, factors such as living in rural areas (aOR = 0.61, 95% CI (0.44–0.84)), and being previously diagnosed with COVID-19 (aOR = 0.66, 95%CI (0.45–0.96) were found negatively associated with vaccine acceptance. In terms of health beliefs items, concerns related to the novelty of vaccine (aOR = 0.42, 95% CI (0.25–0.71)), side effects/vaccine safety (aOR = 0.41, 95% CI (0.23–0.73), reliability of manufacturer (aOR = 0.43, 95% CI (0.30–0.63)), and the number of required doses (aOR = 0.58, 95% CI (0.40–0.84)) were also negatively associated with the willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Remarkably, concerns such as the limited accessibility (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI (1.14–2.47)), and availability of vaccines (aOR = 2.16, 95% CI (1.46–3.20)) were associated with an increased likelihood of willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. With regards to cues of action, receiving reliable and adequate information about the vaccine (aOR = 1.98, 95% CI (1.36–2.88)), recommendation by health authorities (aOR = 1.93, 95% CI(1.33–2.81)), and recommendations from health facilities (aOR = 2.68, 95% CI(1.80–3.99)) were also positively associated with vaccine acceptance. Lastly, perception of COVID-19 vaccine benefits by HCWs in terms of protecting them and their close contacts (patients, family members, and friends) from COVID-19 infection (aOR = 4.21, 95% CI (2.78–7.11)) was associated with an increased likelihood of vaccine uptake. The moderate acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among HCWs found in our study could have broader extents. Understanding and pointing out factors impairing vaccine acceptance such as concerns about the novelty of vaccine and manufacturers’ reliability are required to reach a higher vaccination rate."
https://openalex.org/W4213289544,"A goal of single-cell genome-wide profiling is to reconstruct dynamic transitions during cell differentiation, disease onset and drug response. Single-cell assays have recently been integrated with lineage tracing, a set of methods that identify cells of common ancestry to establish bona fide dynamic relationships between cell states. These integrated methods have revealed unappreciated cell dynamics, but their analysis faces recurrent challenges arising from noisy, dispersed lineage data. In this study, we developed coherent, sparse optimization (CoSpar) as a robust computational approach to infer cell dynamics from single-cell transcriptomics integrated with lineage tracing. Built on assumptions of coherence and sparsity of transition maps, CoSpar is robust to severe downsampling and dispersion of lineage data, which enables simpler experimental designs and requires less calibration. In datasets representing hematopoiesis, reprogramming and directed differentiation, CoSpar identifies early fate biases not previously detected, predicting transcription factors and receptors implicated in fate choice. Documentation and detailed examples for common experimental designs are available at https://cospar.readthedocs.io/ ."
https://openalex.org/W4213246543,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a therapy used for multiple malignant and nonmalignant diseases, with chemotherapy used for pretransplantation myeloablation. The post-HSCT brain contains peripheral engrafted parenchymal macrophages, despite their absence in the normal brain, with the engraftment mechanism still undefined. Here we show that HSCT chemotherapy broadly disrupts mouse brain regenerative populations, including a permanent loss of adult neurogenesis. Microglial density was halved, causing microglial process expansion, coinciding with indicators of broad senescence. Although microglia expressed cell proliferation markers, they underwent cell cycle arrest in S phase with a majority expressing the senescence and antiapoptotic marker p21. In vivo single-cell tracking of microglia after recovery from chemical depletion showed loss of their regenerative capacity, subsequently replaced with donor macrophages. We propose that HSCT chemotherapy causes microglial senescence with a gradual decrease to a critical microglial density, providing a permissive niche for peripheral macrophage engraftment of the brain."
https://openalex.org/W4212887816,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents the majority of drugs from crossing into the brain and reaching neurons. To overcome this challenge, safe and non-invasive technologies targeting receptor-mediated pathways have been developed. In this study, three single-domain antibodies (sdAbs; IGF1R3, IGF1R4, and IGF1R5) targeting the extracellular domain of the human insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R), generated by llama immunization, showed enhanced transmigration across the rat BBB model (SV-ARBEC) in vitro. The rate of brain uptake of these sdAbs fused to mouse Fc (sdAb-mFc) in vivo was estimated using the fluorescent in situ brain perfusion (ISBP) technique followed by optical brain imaging and distribution volume evaluation. Compared to the brains perfused with the negative control A20.1-mFc, the brains perfused with anti-IGF1R sdAbs showed a significant increase of the total fluorescence intensity (~2-fold, p < .01) and the distribution volume (~4-fold, p < .01). The concentration curve for IGF1R4-mFc demonstrated a linear accumulation plateauing at approximately 400 µg (~1 µM), suggesting a saturable mechanism of transport. Capillary depletion and mass spectrometry analyses of brain parenchyma post-ISBP confirmed the IGF1R4-mFc brain uptake with ~25% of the total amount being accumulated in the parenchymal fraction in contrast to undetectable levels of A20.1-mFc after a 5-min perfusion protocol. Systemic administration of IGF1R4-mFc fused with the non-BBB crossing analgesic peptide galanin (2 and 5 mg/kg) induced a dose-dependent suppression of thermal hyperalgesia in the Hargreaves pain model. In conclusion, novel anti-IGF1R sdAbs showed receptor-mediated brain uptake with pharmacologically effective parenchymal delivery of non-permeable neuroactive peptides."
https://openalex.org/W4226093465,"Glioblastomas (GBMs) preferentially generate acetyl-CoA from acetate as a fuel source to promote tumor growth. O-GlcNAcylation has been shown to be elevated by increasing O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) in many cancers and reduced O-GlcNAcylation can block cancer growth. Here, we identify a novel mechanism whereby OGT regulates acetate-dependent acetyl-CoA and lipid production by regulating phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5). OGT is required and sufficient for GBM cell growth and regulates acetate conversion to acetyl-CoA and lipids. Elevating O-GlcNAcylation in GBM cells increases phosphorylation of ACSS2 on Ser-267 in a CDK5-dependent manner. Importantly, we show that ACSS2 Ser-267 phosphorylation regulates its stability by reducing polyubiquitination and degradation. ACSS2 Ser-267 is critical for OGT-mediated GBM growth as overexpression of ACSS2 Ser-267 phospho-mimetic rescues growth in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we show that pharmacologically targeting OGT and CDK5 reduces GBM growth ex vivo. Thus, the OGT/CDK5/ACSS2 pathway may be a way to target altered metabolic dependencies in brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W4212893906,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by changes in both brain activity and microstructural integrity. Cumulative evidence demonstrates that hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) induces neuroplasticity and case-series studies indicate its potentially positive effects on PTSD. The aim of the study was to evaluate HBOT's effect in veterans with treatment resistant PTSD.Veterans with treatment resistant PTSD were 1:1 randomized to HBOT or control groups. All other brain pathologies served as exclusion criteria. Outcome measures included clinician-administered PTSD scale-V (CAPS-V) questionnaires, brief symptom inventory (BSI), BECK depression inventory (BDI), brain microstructural integrity evaluated by MRI diffuse tensor imaging sequence (DTI), and brain function was evaluated by an n-back task using functional MRI (fMRI). The treatment group underwent sixty daily hyperbaric sessions. No interventions were performed in the control group.Thirty-five veterans were randomized to HBOT (N = 18) or control (n = 17) and 29 completed the protocol. Following HBOT, there was a significant improvement in CAPS-V scores and no change in the control (F = 30.57, P<0.0001, Net effect size = 1.64). Significant improvements were also demonstrated in BSI and BDI scores (F = 5.72, P = 0.024 Net effect size = 0.89, and F = 7.65, P = 0.01, Net effect size = 1.03). Improved brain activity was seen in fMRI in the left dorsolateral prefrontal, middle temporal gyri, both thalami, left hippocampus and left insula. The DTI showed significant increases in fractional anisotropy in the fronto-limbic white-matter, genu of the corpus callosum and fornix.HBOT improved symptoms, brain microstructure and functionality in veterans with treatment resistant PTSD."
https://openalex.org/W4212910964,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the COVID-19 vaccination experience among United States-based dental professionals and students: to understand their beliefs, concerns, safety and confidence levels, and side effects experienced after vaccination; striving to boost vaccination acceptability to curtail the pandemic.An observational survey study approved by The University of Texas Health San Antonio Institutional Review Board was distributed to members of the School of Dentistry community using Qualtrics XM software. The survey was completed anonymously. Data were analyzed using R statistical computing software, χ2 test and Fisher's Exact test.Over 80% of all participants felt moderately to very safe working after the COVID-19 vaccine was made available, and more than 75% were moderately to very confident that the vaccine can protect them during the pandemic. At least 35% were moderately to very concerned about immediate and long-term side effects of the vaccine; despite the concerns, 94% received the vaccine. Side effects were more common after the second dose of the vaccine. Most common side effects were injection site pain, and general side effects of fatigue/tiredness, headache, muscle/body ache, and chills/fever. 74% reported no effect of the vaccine on daily activities, and the severity of side effects no worse than mild (about 60%).Majority of the participants felt safe and confident that the vaccine would protect them against COVID-19 infection. Sharing these findings and reliable information that the vaccine is safe and effective is paramount to fostering the vaccine uptake and curtailing the pandemic.Findings of this study demonstrated the confidence of the UT Health San Antonio, School of Dentistry community that the benefits of the vaccines greatly outweigh the risks; boosting the vaccination acceptance while creating a COVID-19 free environment both for the academic dental setting and the community it serves."
https://openalex.org/W4212991545,"Neutralizing antibodies are important for protection against the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus, and long-term memory responses determine the risk of re-infection or boosting after vaccination. T-cellular responses are considered important for partial protection against novel variants of concern.A prospective cohort of hospitalized (n = 14) and community (n = 38) patients with rt-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Blood samples and clinical data were collected when diagnosed and at 6 months. Serum samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-spike specific antibodies using ELISA (IgG, IgA, IgM), pseudotype neutralization and microneutralization assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were investigated for virus-specific T-cell responses in the interferon-γ and interleukin-2 fluorescent-linked immunosorbent spot (FluroSpot) assay.We found durable SARS-CoV-2 spike- and internal protein specific T-cellular responses in patients with persistent antibodies at 6 months. Significantly higher IL-2 and IFN-γ secreting T-cell responses as well as SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies were detected in hospitalized compared to community patients. The immune response was impacted by age, gender, comorbidity and severity of illness, reflecting clinical observations.SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cellular and antibody responses persisted for 6 months post confirmed infection. In previously infected patients, re-exposure or vaccination will boost long-term immunity, possibly providing protection against re-infection with variant viruses."
https://openalex.org/W4213305011,"Background The World Health Organization stated a pandemic by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS-Cov2 (COVID-19) on March, 2020 with devastating implications for populations, healthcare systems, and economies globally. Objective The present study explores the association between patients living in municipalities with crowding conditions and poverty and mortality from COVID-19 in Mexico; specifically evaluating the socioeconomic characteristics of the municipality in which the patients reside and some individual characteristics. Methods In the present study, we examined public information collected from the National Epidemiological Surveillance System informing all persons tested for SARS-CoV-2 and published by the Ministry of Health. The present analysis was restricted to those with the date of registration to October 12, 2021. The association between the main exposures (overcrowded conditions and poverty) and the outcomes of interest (death by COVID-19) was explored using Cox proportional hazard regression models, including frailty penalties to accommodate multilevel data and random effects for the municipality of case occurrence. Results A total of 9619917 subjects were included in the Epidemiological Surveillance System for viral respiratory disease platform. Of those for which results were available, 6141403 were negative for COVID-19 and 3478514 were positive for COVID-19; with a total of 273216 deaths in those who tested positive. Among those positive to COVID-19 mean age was 46.9. Patients living in municipalities with high rates of crowding conditions increased the risk of dying from COVID-19 by 8% (95% CI: 1.03, 1.14). Individuals living in municipalities with indigenous background was associated with an increased risk of dying from COVID-19 (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.17). Individuals living in municipalities with illiteracy (HR = 1.09; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.11), poverty (HR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.19), food insecurity (HR = 1.094; 95% CI 1.02, 1.06), limited access to social security (HR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.13) and health services (HR = 1.06; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.08) had a higher risk of mortality from COVID-19. Conclusion Our data suggest that patients living in municipalities with higher rates of crowding conditions and higher rates of poverty had elevated risk of mortality from COVID-19. In Mexico, the COVID-19 pandemic is a systemic crisis linked to human development since we have seen that it affects less developed and more vulnerable municipalities. Policies to reduce vulnerabilities and develop strategies to deal with health crises like the current one needs to be considered."
https://openalex.org/W4212860846,"High-redox-potential reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), generated by NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and related enzymes, are key effector molecules of innate immunity. High-redox-potential radicals are difficult to distinguish by imaging from less potent ROS/RNS functioning as background biological signaling molecules. Here we present 4-[18F]fluoro-1-naphthol ([18F]4FN), a redox-tuned radiopharmaceutical that selectively binds proteins and cells when oxidized by products of human MPO plus H2O2, but not H2O2 alone, and can be detected using positron emission tomography (PET). Activating HL-60 neutrophil-like human cells with phorbol ester (PMA) caused [18F]4FN retention five-fold over unstimulated cells. An MPO-specific inhibitor (4-ABAH) blocked cellular retention by more than 95%. [18F]4FN PET/CT imaging discriminated inflammatory foci in vivo in three murine models of activated innate immunity: endotoxin-induced toxic shock, PMA-induced contact dermatitis and lipopolysaccharide-induced ankle arthritis. 4-ABAH and Cybb-/- (Nox2-/-) gene deletion strongly abrogated [18F]4FN retention in vivo. Thus, [18F]4FN shows promise as a robust reporter of innate immunity activation by PET/CT."
https://openalex.org/W4213071979,"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global crisis that evolves from a complex system of factors. Understanding what factors interact is key to finding solutions. Our objective was to identify the factors influencing AMR in the European food system and places to intervene.We conducted two workshops involving participants with diverse perspectives to identify the factors influencing AMR and leverage points (places) to target interventions. Transcripts were open coded for factors and connections, then transcribed into Vensim 8.0.4 to develop a causal loop diagram (CLD) and compute the number of feedback loops. Thematic analysis followed to describe AMR dynamics in Europe's food system and places for intervention. The CLD and themes were confirmed via participant feedback.Seventeen participants representing human, animal and agricultural sectors identified 91 CLD factors and 331 connections. Seven themes (e.g., social and economic conditions) describing AMR dynamics in Europe's food system, five 'overarching factors' that impact the entire CLD system (e.g., leadership) and fourteen places for intervention (e.g., consumer demand) emerged from workshop discussions. Most leverage points fell on highly networked feedback loops suggesting that intervening at these places may create unpredictable consequences.Our study produced a CLD of factors influencing AMR in Europe's food system that implicates sectors across the One Health spectrum. The high connectivity between the CLD factors described by participants and our finding that factors are connected with many feedback mechanisms underscores the complexity of the AMR problem and the challenge with finding long-term solutions. Identifying factors and feedbacks helped identify relevant leverage points in the system. Some actions, such as government's setting AMU standards may be easier to implement. These actions in turn can support multi-pronged actions that can help redefine the vision, values and goals of the system to sustainably tackle AMR."
https://openalex.org/W4213286268,"The direct collocation (DC) method has shown low computational costs in solving optimization problems in human movements, but it has rarely been used for solving optimal control pedaling problems. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a DC framework for optimal control simulation of human pedaling within the OpenSim modeling environment. A planar bicycle-rider model was developed in OpenSim. The DC method was formulated in MATLAB to solve an optimal control pedaling problem using a data tracking approach. Using the developed DC framework, the optimal control pedaling problem was successfully solved in 24 minutes to ten hours with different objective function weightings and number of nodes from two different initial conditions. The optimal solutions for equal objective function weightings were successful in terms of tracking, with the model simulated pedal angles and pedal forces within ±1 standard deviation of the experimental data. With these weightings, muscle tendon unit (MTU) excitation patterns generally matched with burst timings and shapes observed in the experimental EMG data. Tracking quality and MTU excitation patterns were changed little by selection of node density above 31, and the optimal solution quality was not affected by initial guess used. The proposed DC framework could easily be turned into a predictive simulation with other objective functions such as fastest pedaling rate. This flexible and computationally efficient framework should facilitate the use of optimal control methods to study the biomechanics, energetics, and control of human pedaling."
https://openalex.org/W4213440929,"Ethnobotanical field surveys were carried out in the Tanawal area of the Lesser Himalayan Region, Khyber Pakhtunkhawa, Province from April 2016 to October 2017. The area is located between 34.36 (34° 21' 30 N) latitude and 73.07 (73° 4' 0 E) longitude with an average elevation of 1374 meters above sea level. Ethnomedicinal data were collected through Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA), and participants were selected through the snow-boll technique. Semi-structured, in-depth and open-ended interviews were conducted. The data were quantitatively evaluated using ethnomedicinal indices i.e. Relative frequency of citation (RFCs), Fidelity level (FL), and Use Value (UV). The ethnobotanical data were also comparatively analyzed through the Jaccard Index (JI). The study yielded 66 medicinal plants in 62 genera and 43 families. Asteraceae and Solanaceae were the most important families with five medicinal taxa each. Regarding medicinal plant part utilization, leaves (43.28%) were used predominantly, followed by whole plant (14.92%) and fruits (14.92%). Decoction was the main drug formulation applied to 21 species (31.15%) and the oral route was most common (56.1%) while 31.2% of medicinal plants were used for both oral and topical applications. Fifty health disorders were recorded and grouped in 15 categories. Maximum species were used to treat gastrointestinal disorders i.e. 13 species, dermal problems (12 species), and respiratory tract ailments (9). The calculated RFCs ranged between 81 to 31. The most important medicinal plants were Acacia modesta, Citrullus vulgaris, Tamarindus indica, and Momordica charantia with an RGFC of 81 each. The UV ranged between 0.58 and 3.6. Medicinal taxa with the highest UV were Dioscorea deltoidea (3.6), Withania coagulans (3.3), Momordica charantia (3.5), Silybum marianum and Pyrus pashia (3.2). FL values showed that 28 (41.79%) species had a FL value below 50 (74.62%) while 39 (58.20%) had higher FL values. Momordica charantia, Tamarindus indica, Acacia modesta and Citrullus vulgaris were 95.2 each. The Jaccard Index (JI) values ranged from16.77 to 0.98. The current study also reported 16 medicinal plants, commonly used around the globe, have been rarely documented for their medicinal values in the local ethnomedicinal literature i.e. Althaea officinalis, Plantanus orientalis, Jasminum sombac, Maytenus royleana, Cucurbita maxima, Phyllanthus emblica, Citrullus vulgaris. Polygonatum verticilliatum, Caseria tomentosa, Cistanche tubulosa, Bambusa arundinacea, Schinus molle, Tamarindus indica, Pongamia pinnata, Citrus limon and Catharanthus roseus. However, 48 medicinal plants had been reported in the literature but the current study reported their novel medicinal uses. Important taxa should be established in botanical gardens for in-situ conservation, chemical investigation and sustainable utilization. It would also be effective to improve the livelihoods of the local population."
https://openalex.org/W4226054252,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated 58 loci in coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the biological basis for these associations, the relevant genes, and causative variants often remain uncertain. Since the vast majority of GWAS loci reside outside coding regions, most exert regulatory functions. Here we explore the complexity of each of these loci, using tissue specific RNA sequencing data from GTEx to identify genes that exhibit altered expression patterns in the context of GWAS-significant loci, expanding the list of candidate genes from the 75 currently annotated by GWAS to 245, with almost half of these transcripts being non-coding. Tissue specific allelic expression imbalance data, also from GTEx, allows us to uncover GWAS variants that mark functional variation in a locus, e.g., rs7528419 residing in the SORT1 locus, in liver specifically, and rs72689147 in the GUYC1A1 locus, across a variety of tissues. We consider the GWAS variant rs1412444 in the LIPA locus in more detail as an example, probing tissue and transcript specific effects of genetic variation in the region. By evaluating linkage disequilibrium (LD) between tissue specific eQTLs, we reveal evidence for multiple functional variants within loci. We identify 3 variants (rs1412444, rs1051338, rs2250781) that when considered together, each improve the ability to account for LIPA gene expression, suggesting multiple interacting factors. These results refine the assignment of 58 GWAS loci to likely causative variants in a handful of cases and for the remainder help to re-prioritize associated genes and RNA isoforms, suggesting that ncRNAs maybe a relevant transcript in almost half of CAD GWAS results. Our findings support a multi-factorial system where a single variant can influence multiple genes and each genes is regulated by multiple variants."
https://openalex.org/W4212944544,"The pressure on land resources continuously increases not only with the rising demand for agricultural commodities, but also with the growing need for action on global challenges, such as biodiversity loss or climate change, where land plays a crucial role. Land saving as a strategy, where agricultural productivity is increased to allow a reduction of required cropland while sustaining production volumes and meeting demand, could address this trade-off. With our interdisciplinary model-based study, we globally assess regional potentials of land saving and analyze resulting effects on agricultural production, prices and trade. Thereby, different land saving strategies are investigated that (1) minimize required cropland (2) minimize spatial marginalization induced by land saving and (3) maximize the attainable profit. We find that current cropland requirements could be reduced between 37% and 48%, depending on the applied land saving strategy. The generally more efficient use of land would cause crop prices to fall in all regions, but also trigger an increase in global agricultural production of 2.8%. While largest land saving potentials occur in regions with high yield gaps, the impacts on prices and production are strongest in highly populated regions with already high pressure on land. Global crop prices and trade affect regional impacts of land saving on agricultural markets and can displace effects to spatially distant regions. Our results point out the importance of investigating the potentials and effects of land saving in the context of global markets within an integrative, global framework. The resulting land saving potentials can moreover reframe debates on global potentials for afforestation and carbon sequestration, as well as on how to reconcile agricultural production and biodiversity conservation and thus contribute to approaching central goals of the 21st century, addressed for example in the Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement or the post-2020 global biodiversity framework."

Our paper describes how and why UNAIDS arrived at the societal enabler targets adopted. We conducted a scoping review and led a participatory process between January 2019 and June 2020 to develop an evidence-based framework for action, propose global societal enabler targets, and identify indicators for monitoring progress. A re-envisioned framework called the ‘3 S’s of the HIV response: Society, Systems and Services’ was defined. In the framework, societal enablers enhance the effectiveness of HIV programmes by removing impediments to service availability, access and uptake at the societal level, while service and system enablers improve efficiencies in and expand the reach of HIV services and systems. Investments in societal enabling approaches that remove legal barriers, shift harmful social and gender norms, reduce inequalities and improve institutional and community structures are needed to progressively realize four overarching societal enablers, the first three of which fall within the purview of the HIV sector: (i) societies with supportive legal environments and access to justice, (ii) gender equal societies, (iii) societies free from stigma and discrimination, and (iv) co-action across development sectors to reduce exclusion and poverty. Three top-line and 15 detailed targets were recommended for monitoring progress towards their achievement. The clear articulation of societal enablers in the re-envisioned framework should have a substantial impact on improving the effectiveness of core HIV programmes if implemented. Together with the new global targets, the framework will also galvanize advocacy to scale up societal enabling approaches with proven impact on HIV outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4212988940,"Background COVID-19 pandemic resulted in about 165 million infections and 3.4 million deaths all over the world across 15 months. The most severe clinical presentation of COVID-19 diseases is interstitial pneumonia. Methods In this paper we describe clinical outcomes based on radiological features as well as the pattern of haematochemical parameters and IgG/IgM antibodies in 75 patients hospitalized due to COVID-related interstitial pneumonia not requiring intensive care assistance. Each patient underwent routine laboratory tests, including inflammatory markers and coagulation profile at baseline. Computed Tomography (CT) was performed at baseline and after 3 months to assess the persistence of radiological sequelae. A Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was used to test for each patient the association between individual haematochemical parameters at the time of hospital admission and the subsequent radiological features after three months. The presence of IgG antibodies was quantitatively determined in 70 patients at the time of hospital admission and after 3 months. A subgroup of 49 and 21 patients underwent additional dosage of IgG after 6 and 12 months, respectively. IgM serological antibodies were available for 17 patients at baseline and 61 at T3, with additional follow-up for 51 and 20 subjects after 6 and 12 months, respectively. Results Only 28 out of 75 patients discharged from the hospital were totally healed after 3 months, while 47 patients (62.7%) still presented radiological sequelae. According to the GLM model, specific haematochemical baseline parameters—such as IL-6, GPT, platelets and eosinophil count—showed a statistically significant association with the presence of radiological sequelae at month 3 highlighting an OR = 0.5, thus meaning that subjects completely healed after 3 months presented half levels of IL-6 at baseline compared to patients with sequelae. In general, IgG serum levels were always higher than IgM at the time of hospitalization (75% at T0; n = 12 out of 16 patients with data available in both visits), after 3 months (72.1%; n = 44 out of 61 pts.), after 6 months (56.8%; 25 out of 44 pts.), and one year after hospitalization (60%; 12 out of 20 pts.). Overall, IgG and IgM serum levels presented a statistically significant decreasing trend from the baseline to month 3, 6 and 12. One patient presented an increase in IgM between baseline and month 3 but negative PCR test for SARS-COV2 on throat swab. Conclusions As supported by our findings on 75 patients, COVID-related interstitial pneumonia triggers early IgG levels (higher than IgM) that gradually decrease over 12 months. Mid-term sequelae are still detectable at lung Computed Tomography after 3 months from the hospital admission. Occasionally, it is possible to observe increase of IgM levels in presence of low concentrations of IgG and negative PCR ELISA tests for SARS-COV2 RNA. Baseline levels of IL-6 could be proposed as predictor of radiological mid/long-term sequelae after COVID-related interstitial pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W4213434604,"Background Anopheles stephensi Listen (1901) is a major vector of malaria in Asia and has recently been found in some regions of Africa. The An . stepehnsi species complex is suspected to have three sibling species: type, intermediate, and mysorensis, each with its own vector competence to the malaria parasite and ecology. To identify the members of the species complex in our An . stephensi insectary colony, we used the morphological features of eggs and genetic markers such as Anste Obp1 ( Anopheles stephensi odorant binding protein 1), mitochondrial oxidases subunit 1 and 2 (COI and COII), and nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 locus (ITS2). Methods Eggs were collected from individual mosquitoes ( n = 50) and counted for the number of ridges under stereomicroscope. Genomic DNA was extracted from female mosquitoes. After the amplification of partial fragments of Anste Obp1, COI, COII and ITS2 genes, the PCR products were purified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed after aligning query sequences against the submitted sequences in GenBank using MEGA 7. Results The range of ridges number on each egg float was 12–13 that corresponds to the mysorensis form of An . stephensi . The generated COI, COII and ITS2 sequences showed 100%, 99.46% and 99.29% similarity with the sequences deposited for Chinese, Indian and Iranian strains of An . stephensi , respectively. All the generated Anste Obp1 intron I region sequences matched 100% with the sequences deposited for An . stephensi sibling species C (mysorensis form) from Iran and Afghanistan. Conclusions This manuscript precisely describes the morphological and molecular details of the ‘var mysorensis’ form of An . stephensi that could be exploited in elucidating its classification as well as in differentiation from other biotypes of the same or other anopheline species. Based on our findings, we recommend Anste Obp1 as a robust genetic marker for rapid and accurate discrimination (taxonomic identification) of the An . stephensi species complex, rather than the COI, COII, and ITS2 marker, which could only be utilized for interspecies ( Anopheles ) differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W4212959160,"Chlamydia trachomatis causes genital and ocular infections in humans. This bacterial pathogen multiplies exclusively within host cells in a characteristic vacuole (inclusion) and delivers proteins such as inclusion membrane proteins (Incs) into the host cell. Here, we identified CT006 as a novel C. trachomatis protein that when expressed ectopically eukaryotic cells can associate with lipid droplets (LDs). A screen using Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified two Incs causing vacuolar protein sorting defects and seven Incs showing tropism for eukaryotic organelles. Ectopic expression in yeast and mammalian cells of genes encoding different fragments of CT006 revealed tropism for the endoplasmic reticulum and LDs. We identified a LD-targeting region within the first 88 amino acid residues of CT006, and positively charged residues important for this targeting. Comparing with the parental wild-type strain, cells infected by a newly generated C. trachomatis strain overproducing CT006 with a double hemagglutinin tag showed a slight increase in the area occupied by LDs within the inclusion region. However, we could not correlate this effect with the LD-targeting regions within CT006. We further showed that both the amino and carboxy-terminal regions of CT006, flanking the Inc-characteristic bilobed hydrophobic domain, are exposed to the host cell cytosol during C. trachomatis infection, supporting their availability to interact with host cell targets. Altogether, our data suggest that CT006 might participate in the interaction of LDs with C. trachomatis inclusions."
https://openalex.org/W4213009820,"Adolescents are currently becoming sexually active before their 18th birthday during which they have to battle with unsafe sexual behaviours, teenage pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and school dropouts. The trend is linked with low soft skills (self-esteem and assertiveness skills) for them to make informed, reasoned, and responsible decisions over sexual activities. This study designed and tested the effect of integrated reproductive health (RH) lesson materials in a problem-based pedagogy (PBP) to enhance soft skills for safe sexual behaviour among adolescents in Tanzania.A double-blinded clustered randomized controlled trial was conducted between September 2019 and September 2020 among 660 randomly selected adolescents. A Sexual-risk Behaviour Beliefs and Self-esteem Scale adopted from previous studies measured soft skills for safe sexual behaviour. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed by using the statistical analysis software programme version 9.4. The effect of the intervention was determined using Linear Mixed Model set at α error probability = 5% significance level (95% confidence interval) and a β error probability = 0.80.Adolescents' mean age was 15±1.869 with 57.5% females. The end-line findings indicated that the coefficient of soft skills was significantly higher among adolescents in the hybrid PBP (β=9.0986, p<0.01; 95%CI: 4.7772, 14.2311) and pure PBP (β =8.7114, p<0.01; 95%CI: 3.9990, 10.1208) than in the control group. The retention rate of soft skills was still significantly higher at 3-months follow-up (β=2.0044; p<0.01; 95%CI: 1.0234, 4.1182) and at 6-months follow-up (β=1.9803; p<0.01; 95%CI: 0.8399, 3.1099) compared to the baseline and immediate post-intervention assessments.The intervention substantially enhanced soft skills for safe sexual behaviour among adolescents of both sex. Despite the fact that scores for soft skills varied across the study timelines, adolescents demonstrated significant intentions to abstain from sexual intercourse, delay sexual relationships, negotiate condom use, and withstand sexual coercions. The PBP may need to be incorporated in ordinary level secondary school curricula as a formal guide to teachers and or health workers to optimally prepare adolescents for their healthy adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W4213018899,"Background Despite efforts to incorporate experience of care for women and newborns in global quality standards, there are limited efforts to understand experience of care for sick newborns and young infants. This paper describes the manifestations, responses, and consequences of mistreatment of sick young infants (SYIs), drivers, and parental responses in hospital settings in Kenya. Methods A qualitative formative study to inform the development of strategies for promoting family engagement and respectful care of SYI was conducted in five facilities in Kenya. Data were collected from in-depth interviews with providers and policy makers (n = 35) and parents (n = 25), focus group discussions with women and men (n = 12 groups), and ethnographic observations in each hospital (n = 64 observation sessions). Transcribed data were organized using Nvivo 12 software and analyzed thematically. Results We identified 5 categories of mistreatment: 1) health system conditions and constraints, including a) failure to meet professional standards, b) delayed provision of care; and c) limited provider skills; 2) stigma and discrimination, due to provider perception of personal hygiene or medical condition, and patient feelings of abandonment; 3) physically inappropriate care, including providers taking blood samples and inserting intravenous lines and nasogastric tubes in a rough manner; or parents being pressured to forcefully feed infants or share unsterile feeding cups to avoid providers’ anger; 4) poor parental-provider rapport, expressed as ineffective communication, verbal abuse, perceived disinterest, and non-consented care; and 5) no organized form of bereavement and posthumous care in the case of infant’s death. Parental responses to mistreatment were acquiescent or non-confrontational and included feeling humiliated or accepting the situation. Assertive responses were rare but included articulating disappointment by expressing anger, and/or deciding to seek care elsewhere. Conclusion Mistreatment for SYIs is linked to poor quality of care. To address mistreatment in SYI, interventions that focus on building better communication, responding to the developmental needs of infants and emotional needs for parents, strengthen providers competencies in newborn care, as well as a supportive, enabling environments, will lead to more respectful quality care for newborns and young infants."
https://openalex.org/W4213295842,"Characteristics of patients at risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19 disease have been widely described, but very few studies describe their evolution through the following waves. Data was collected retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database from a University Hospital in Paris area, over a year corresponding to the first three waves of COVID-19 in France. Evolution of patient characteristics between non-severe and severe cases through the waves was analyzed with a classical multivariate logistic regression along with a complementary Machine-Learning-based analysis using explainability methods. On 1076 hospitalized patients, severe forms concerned 29% (123/429), 31% (66/214) and 18% (79/433) of each wave. Risk factors of the first wave included old age (≥ 70 years), male gender, diabetes and obesity while cardiovascular issues appeared to be a protective factor. Influence of age, gender and comorbidities on the occurrence of severe COVID-19 was less marked in the 3rd wave compared to the first 2, and the interactions between age and comorbidities less important. Typology of hospitalized patients with severe forms evolved rapidly through the waves. This evolution may be due to the changes of hospital practices and the early vaccination campaign targeting the people at high risk such as elderly and patients with comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W4213361096,"Dickeya solani is a pathogen most frequently responsible for infecting potato plants in Europe. As in the case of most plant pathogens, its ability to colonize and invade the host depends on chemotaxis and motility. The coordinated movement of Dickeya over solid surfaces is governed by a quorum sensing mechanism. In D. solani motility is regulated by ExpI-ExpR proteins, homologous to luxI-luxR system from Vibrio fisheri, in which N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) serve as signaling molecules. Moreover, in many Gram-negative bacteria motility is coupled with central metabolism via carbon catabolite repression. This enables them to reach more nutrient-efficient niches. The aim of this study was to analyze the swarming motility of D. solani depending on the volume of the medium in the cultivation plate and glucose content. We show that the ability of this bacterium to move is strictly dependent on both these factors. Moreover, we analyze the production of AHLs and show that the quorum sensing mechanism in D. solani is also influenced by the availability of glucose in the medium and that the distribution of these signaling molecules are different depending on the volume of the medium in the plate."
https://openalex.org/W4213435859,"Reliability of preclinical research is of critical concern. Prior studies have demonstrated the low reproducibility of research results and recommend implementing higher standards to improve overall quality and robustness of research. One understudied aspect of this quality issue is the harmony between the research hypotheses and the experimental design in published work.In this study we focused on highly cited cell culture studies and investigated whether commonly asserted cell culture claims such as viability, cytotoxicity, proliferation rate, cell death and apoptosis are backed with sufficient experimental evidence or not. We created an open access database containing 280 claims asserted by 103 different high-impact articles as well as the results of this study. Our findings revealed that only 64% of all claims were sufficiently supported by evidence and there were concerning misinterpretations such as considering the results of tetrazolium salt reduction assays as indicators of cell death or apoptosis.Our analysis revealed a discordance between experimental findings and the way they were presented and discussed in the manuscripts. To improve quality of pre-clinical research, we require clear nomenclature by which different cell culture claims are distinctively categorized; materials and methods sections to be written more meticulously; and cell culture methods to be selected and utilized more carefully. In this paper we recommend a nomenclature for selected cell culture claims as well as a methodology for collecting evidence to support those claims."
https://openalex.org/W4225729249,"While an array of taxa are capable of producing fluorescent pigments, fluorescence in mammals is a novel and poorly understood phenomenon. A first step towards understanding the potential adaptive functions of fluorescence in mammals is to develop an understanding of fluorescent compounds, or fluorophores, that are present in fluorescent tissue. Here we use Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) of flying squirrel fur known to fluoresce under ultraviolet (UV) light to identify potentially fluorescent compounds in squirrel fur. All of the potentially fluorescent compounds we identified were either present in non-fluorescent fur or were not present in all species of fluorescent flying squirrel. Therefore, we suggest that the compounds responsible for fluorescence in flying squirrels may also be present in non-fluorescent mammal fur. Some currently unexplained factor likely leads to excitation of fluorophores in flying squirrel fur. A recently suggested hypothesis that fluorescence in mammals is widely caused by porphyrins is consistent with our findings."

Additionally, women have other interlinked sexual health concerns such as unintended pregnancy. We evaluated acceptability of a 90-day ring to prevent HIV and hypothetical preferences for a dual (HIV and contraceptive) indication. This was a secondary analysis of a Phase 1, two-arm, multi-site, placebo-controlled randomized trial evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics of a 90-day vaginal ring containing tenofovir for HIV prevention (N = 49). We used a mixed methods approach to assess quantitative data on acceptability (n = 49) and used qualitative data from a random subset to explain the quantitative findings (N = 25). The 3-month extended duration tenofovir ring was highly acceptable. Participants perceived the ring to be easy to use, comfortable and reported liking it more over time. About half felt the ring during sex but most of those participants said it bothered them only a little. Concerns about hygiene increased over the study period but were often outweighed by the benefits of an extended duration ring. Interest in a multi-purpose ring was high (77%) and even higher among those who were sexually active and had male partners. The 3-month extended duration tenofovir ring for HIV prevention was highly acceptable among women and interest in an MPT was high."
https://openalex.org/W4212932104,"In the design of qualitative interview studies, researchers are faced with the challenge of choosing between many different methods of interviewing participants. This decision is particularly important when sensitive topics are involved. Even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, considerations of cost, logistics, and participant anonymity have increasingly pushed more interviews online. While previous work has anecdotally compared the advantages of different online interview methods, no empirical evaluation has been undertaken. To fill this gap, we conducted 154 interviews with sensitive questions across seven randomly assigned conditions, exploring differences arising from the mode (video, audio, email, instant chat, survey), anonymity level, and scheduling requirements. We surveyed interviewers and interviewees after their interview for perceptions on rapport, anonymity, and honesty. In addition, we completed a mock qualitative analysis, using the resulting codes as a measure of data equivalence. We note several qualitative differences across mode related to rapport, disclosure, and anonymity. However, we found little evidence to suggest that interview data was impacted by mode for outcomes related to interview experience or data equivalence. The most substantial differences were related logistics where we found substantially lower eligibility and completion rates, and higher time and monetary costs for audio and video modes."
https://openalex.org/W4212942859,"The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has generated an immense amount of potentially infectious waste, primarily face masks, which require rapid and sanitary disposal in order to mitigate the spread of the disease. Yet, within Africa, large segments of the population lack access to reliable municipal solid waste management (SWM) services, both complicating the disposal of hazardous waste, and public health efforts. Drawing on extensive qualitative fieldwork, including 96 semi-structured interviews, across four different low-income communities in Blantyre, Malawi and Durban, South Africa, the purpose of this article is to respond to a qualitative gap on mask disposal behaviours, particularly from within low-income and African contexts. Specifically, our purpose was to understand what behaviours have arisen over the past year, across the two disparate national contexts, and how they have been influenced by individual risk perceptions, established traditional practice, state communication, and other media sources. Findings suggest that the wearing of cloth masks simplifies disposal, as cloth masks can (with washing) be reused continuously. However, in communities where disposable masks are more prevalent, primarily within Blantyre, the pit latrine had been adopted as the most common space for 'safe' disposal for a used mask. We argue that this is not a new behaviour, however, and that the pit latrine was already an essential part of many low-income households SWM systems, and that within the Global South, the pit latrine fulfils a valuable and uncounted solid waste management function, in addition to its sanitation role."
https://openalex.org/W4212966817,"Obesity, associated with having excess body fat, is a critical public health problem that can cause serious diseases. Although a range of techniques for body fat estimation have been developed to assess obesity, these typically involve high-cost tests requiring special equipment. Thus, the accurate prediction of body fat percentage based on easily accessed body measurements is important for assessing obesity and its related diseases. By considering the characteristics of different features (e.g. body measurements), this study investigates the effectiveness of feature extraction for body fat prediction. It evaluates the performance of three feature extraction approaches by comparing four well-known prediction models. Experimental results based on two real-world body fat datasets show that the prediction models perform better on incorporating feature extraction for body fat prediction, in terms of the mean absolute error, standard deviation, root mean square error and robustness. These results confirm that feature extraction is an effective pre-processing step for predicting body fat. In addition, statistical analysis confirms that feature extraction significantly improves the performance of prediction methods. Moreover, the increase in the number of extracted features results in further, albeit slight, improvements to the prediction models. The findings of this study provide a baseline for future research in related areas."
https://openalex.org/W4213067221,"Many health risks in pregnant women and their foetuses can be reduced by practicing antenatal exercise. However, the adequate practice of antenatal exercise among pregnant women is low in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the practice of antenatal exercise and its associated factors among pregnant women in Arba Minch town.A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted. Data were collected by using a structured questionnaire from 422 pregnant women selected by a simple random sampling technique. Descriptive statistics were computed and a binary logistic regression model was fitted. In multivariable logistic-regression adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals were used to determine the strength of associations. The significance level was declared at a p-value < 0.05.Among 410 participants, 32.9% (95% CI 28%-37%) adequately practiced antenatal exercise. Factors negatively associated with an adequate antenatal exercise were husband's primary school level [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.3, (95% CI: 0.1, 0.7)], history of miscarriage [AOR = 0.3, (95% CI: 0.1, 0.7)], inadequate knowledge [AOR = 0.2, (95% CI: 0.1, 0.3)], and unfavorable attitude [AOR = 0.3, (95% CI 0.2, 0.5)]. Whereas, factors positively associated with an adequate antenatal exercise were employment status of women [AOR = 4.8, (95% CI: 1.8, 13.1)], and a practice of regular exercise before current pregnancy [AOR = 1.9, (95% CI: 1.1, 3.2)].The findings of this study indicated that adequate practice of antenatal exercise was found to be low. Appropriate measures should be taken to improve the husband's educational level, mother's occupation, knowledge, and attitudes towards antenatal exercise. Special consideration should be given to those with a history of miscarriage and women should be encouraged to practice regular exercise before pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4213380151,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common chronic liver disease with no decisive treatment. The sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor ipragliflozin was developed as a new oral hypoglycemic drug, which can improve NASH via an insulin-independent glucose-lowering effect by inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the renal proximal tubules. However, ipragliflozin appears to modulate steatosis or inflammation via different pathways. To elucidate the new mechanism of ipragliflozin for the treatment of NASH, we evaluated its effects in a NASH mouse model (STAM mice) with beta cell depletion, and compared the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in STAM mice treated with or without ipragliflozin (16.7 μg/day for 5 weeks). Ipragliflozin reduced aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase levels, along with reduced hepatic steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning, lobular inflammation, and liver fibrosis. In addition, ipragliflozin upregulated mitochondrial transport-related and antioxidant defensive system-related genes in the liver. Among 2555 mouse miRNA probes, miR-19b-3p was commonly differentially expressed with ipragliflozin treatment for 5 weeks in both the liver and serum but in different directions, with a decrease in the liver and increase in the serum. Therefore, ipragliflozin can improve NASH development likely through the antioxidative stress pathway and by regulating miR-19b-3p."
https://openalex.org/W4213284820,"Cold-water coral (CWC) reefs are numerous and widespread along the Norwegian continental shelf where oil and gas industry operate. Uncertainties exist regarding their impacts from operational discharges to drilling. Effect thresholds obtained from near-realistic exposure of suspended particle concentrations for use in coral risk modeling are particularly needed. Here, nubbins of Desmophyllum pertusum (Lophelia pertusa) were exposed shortly (5 days, 4h repeated pulses) to suspended particles (bentonite BE; barite BA, and drill cuttings DC) in the range of ~ 4 to ~ 60 mg.l-1 (actual concentration). Physiological responses (respiration rate, growth rate, mucus-related particulate organic carbon OC and particulate organic nitrogen ON) and polyp mortality were then measured 2 and 6 weeks post-exposure to assess long-term effects. Respiration and growth rates were not significantly different in any of the treatments tested compared to control. OC production was not affected in any treatment, but a significant increase of OC:ON in mucus produced by BE-exposed (23 and 48 mg.l-1) corals was revealed 2 weeks after exposure. Polyp mortality increased significantly at the two highest DC doses (19 and 49 mg.l-1) 2 and 6 weeks post-exposure but no significant difference was observed in any of the other treatments compared to the control. These findings are adding new knowledge on coral resilience to short realistic exposure of suspended drill particles and indicate overall a risk for long-term effects at a threshold of ~20 mg.l-1."
https://openalex.org/W4213011994,"We assessed the association between household decision-making and mental well-being among Asian immigrant women residing in Korea. We also investigated if the impact varies by the regional origin and examined potential factors for joint decision-making.We conducted a cross-sectional study using the Korean National Survey of Multicultural Families 2015 and logistic regression. We analyzed data from 11,188 married immigrant women ages 20 to 59 who were originally from East Asia or Southeast/South Asia and co-living with their spouses. We defined households as joint-decision, wife-decision, or husband-decision based on who decides how living expenses are spent. Mental well-being encompassed a depressive mood for two consecutive weeks, and life and marital satisfaction.After controlling for covariates, we showed that immigrant women in husband-decision households were more likely to have depressive mood (odds ratio [OR] 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.38), poorer life satisfaction (OR 1.49, 95% CI: 1.24-1.78), and poorer marital satisfaction (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.47-2.22) than women in joint-decision households. Immigrant women in wife-decision households had a similar but slightly lower odds of poor mental well-being. This association was less prominent for Southeast/South Asian origin than East Asian origin, while the age-adjusted prevalence rates of poor mental well-being among them were higher than their East Asian counterparts. Factors that restricted the odds of husband-decision did not necessarily guarantee wife-decision.This study suggests one-sided decision-making can be a risk factor for immigrant women's poor mental well-being, while joint decision-making is protective. Differences across regional origins suggest domestic decision-making might be a less important predictor for mental well-being in immigrants more occupied with adapting to the host society. Factors for joint decision-making should be addressed to improve the mental well-being of immigrant women."
https://openalex.org/W4213017867,"Organic carbon (OC) can be unevenly enriched in different-sized sediment particles under low-intensity, rain-induced overland flows, but its hydraulic mechanisms are not completely understood. Hence, in this study, the hydraulic transport mechanisms of unevenly enriched OC between different-sized sediment particles were investigated through simulated rainfall experiments at gradients of 5°, 10°, and 15° and typical regional rainfall intensities of 45, 90, and 120 mm h-1. Results showed that the critical flow velocity of aggregate transport through loess soil was approximately 0.08 m s-1. When the flow velocity was larger than this critical value, the aggregate loss amount increased quickly and exponentially. Flow velocities lower than 0.08 m s-1 were determined to be essential conditions for uneven OC enrichment between sediment particles. At such velocities, even when the runoff depth was greater than 0.0018 m, the enrichment ratio of soil organic carbon (SOC; ERoc) values in all size classes of sediment particles was larger than 1.0. Small runoff depths caused preferential OC enrichment in silt and clay, whereas large runoff depths promoted OC enrichment in the >0.25 mm size class of sediment particles. The critical flow velocity and transport way differ between these high-OC-concentration clay and silt and large light organic particles. The interaction between flow velocity and runoff depth on ERocs in <0.05 mm particles was larger than that of >0.05 mm particles. Under the transport limit erosion, the flow velocity and stream power positively correlated with uneven ERocs in different size sediment particles through distinct laws. Slope and rainfall intensity could not be ignored in predicting uneven OC enrichment in sediments by interacting with hydraulic factor and effecting aggregate stripping, respectively. Hydraulic factors mainly affected the uneven OC enrichment by controlling particle selective detachment and transport process. Owing to the different hydraulic mechanisms of OC enrichment in different size particles, the obtained regression functions for uneven OC enrichment could be divided into two types. One was for calculating the OC concentrations in sediment particles with sizes of <2 mm (R2 > 0.844, P < 0.005), and the other was for calculating the OC concentrations in large macroaggregates (>2 mm; R2 = 0.805, P < 0.005). The findings provide an important reference for understanding SOC transport mechanisms and its mineralization potential under the effect of water erosion and improving SOC dynamic models."
https://openalex.org/W4213043984,"Background Clinical practice guidelines recommend administering antenatal corticosteroids (ACS), either betamethasone or dexamethasone, to women at risk of preterm birth at less than 35 weeks’ gestation. If women remain at risk of preterm birth seven or more days after an initial course of ACS, most guidelines recommend administration of a repeat dose(s). No randomised trials have assessed the efficacy of dexamethasone as a repeat steroid compared to betamethasone. Aim We aimed to determine if there were differences between the use of dexamethasone or betamethasone as repeat ACS, for women who remain at risk of preterm birth after an initial course, on maternal, infant, and childhood health outcomes. Methods We performed a secondary analysis of data from the ASTEROID randomised trial, where women at risk of preterm birth were allocated to either betamethasone or dexamethasone. Infant, childhood, and maternal outcomes were compared according to whether women received a repeat dose(s) of dexamethasone or betamethasone. The primary outcome was a composite outcome of death or any neurosensory disability at age two years (corrected for prematurity). The ASTEROID trial is registered with ANZCTR, ACTRN12608000631303. Results 168 women and their infants were included, with 86 women receiving dexamethasone and 82 women receiving betamethasone as a repeat dose. Women in the two ACS groups had similar baseline characteristics. We observed little to no difference in the incidence of death or any neurosensory disability at age two years (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.06, p = 0.79) or in the incidence of other infant, childhood, and maternal adverse health outcomes between women who received dexamethasone and those who received betamethasone. Conclusion Use of dexamethasone for a repeat dose(s) compared to betamethasone did not result in any differences in infant, childhood, and maternal health outcomes. These results can be used to support clinical practice guideline recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W4213119703,"Emerging health professionals in undergraduate programs should be equipped to provide care to people with substance use disorder (SUD). The students' personal attributes may impact their attitude toward those with SUD. This study aims to evaluate the impact of personal attributes of Jordanian undergraduate health students on their attitudes toward SUD and examine the relationship between the personal attributes and their devaluation and discriminatory (stigmatory) behaviour toward those with SUD.A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to examine the attitudes and stigmatory behaviours. The data were collected between May to October 2017 with a structured questionnaire that consisted of three parts: 1) a data sheet to collect the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, 2) the Acute Mental Health Scale (ATAMHS), and 3) the Devaluation-Discrimination Scale (DDS).Younger and females demonstrated a positive attitude toward those with SUD compared to older or male students. Age, gender, and previous experience with SUD are significant factors that affect their attitude.Identifying the attitude to people with SUD and personal attributes of emerging health professionals in Jordan will help identify the need to educate them prior to their entry into practice."
https://openalex.org/W4212790800,"In the literature on inter-limb coordination, the coordination among ‘‘focal’’ body parts (i.e., the two limbs) directly engaged in a pendulum swinging task has been studied by immobilizing other body parts to reduce “noise,” while putting aside questions of how one maintains posture while performing the task. However, in practical performance of musical instruments, for example, performers must coordinate different body parts in sync with the music while maintaining the whole body’s balance. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and necessity of understanding inter-limb coordination in whole-body coordination. Participants were asked to move two pendulums either in sync or alternatively with metronome beeps under two conditions: immobile (fixed forearms) and mobile (forearms not fixed). The explorative analyses focused on whether and how coordinative structures emerged and whether the degree of task achievement differed according to the phase mode, frequency, and mobility conditions. The motion similarity and phase difference between different parts and the pendulums showed that task-specific coordinative structures emerged in both immobile and mobile conditions. In the in-phase mobile condition, the emergent coordinative structure may have improved task achievement, shown by the phase difference between the left and right pendulums. These findings suggest that the global coordinative structure is involved in achieving the local pendulum swinging task."
https://openalex.org/W4212921484,"Physical and chemical methods for generating rat models of enteritis have been established; however, antibiotic induction has rarely been used for this purpose. The present study aimed to establish and evaluate a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using antibiotics. A total of 84 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into the following groups, according to the dosage and method of administration of the antibiotics: A, control; B, low-dose clindamycin; C, medium-dose clindamycin; D, high-dose clindamycin; E, low-dose clindamycin, ampicillin and streptomycin; F, medium-dose clindamycin, ampicillin and streptomycin; and G, high-dose clindamycin, ampicillin and streptomycin. Antibiotic administration was stopped on day 7; the modeling period covered days 1-7, and the recovery period covered days 8-15. Half of the animals were dissected on day 11, with the remaining animals dissected on day 15. Food and water intake, body weight and fecal weight were recorded. Intestinal flora was analyzed via microbial culture and quantitative PCR. The content of TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) was assessed in abdominal aorta blood. Colonic and rectal tissues were examined pathologically via hematoxylin-eosin staining to assess leukocyte infiltration and intestinal mucosal changes as indicators of inflammation. Rat weight, food intake, water intake and 2-h fecal weight were significantly different across the experimental groups (P = 0.040, P = 0.016, P<0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively). Microbial cultures revealed no significant differences between group A and B,C (P = 0.546,0.872) but significant differences betwenn group A and the other experimental groups (all P<0.001). Furthermore, significant differences in the levels of Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Dialister invisus on day 4 between groups A, C and F (P = 0.033, P = 0.025 and P = 0.034, respectively). Significant differences were detected in the levels of TNF-α, IL1-β, IL-6 and CRP between the groups (all P<0.001). The colonic and rectal pathological inflammation scores of the experimental groups were significantly different compared with group A (B vs. A, P = 0.002; others, all P<0.001). These findings indicated that an antibiotic-induced IBD model was successfully established in SD rats; this animal model may serve as a useful model for clinical IBD research."
https://openalex.org/W4213000992,"Roads are important for many urban planning applications, such as traffic modelling and delivery vehicle routing. At present, most available datasets represent roads only as centrelines. This is particularily true for OpenStreetMap which provides, among many features, road networks at worldwide coverage. Furthermore, most approaches for creating more detailed networks, such as carriageways or lanes, focus on doing so from sources that are not easy to acquire, such as satellite imagery or LiDAR scans. In this paper we present a methodology to create carriageways based on OpenStreetMap's centrelines and open access areal representations (i.e. polygons) to determine which roads should be represented as two individual carriageways. We applied our methodology in five areas across four different countries with different built environments. We analysed the outcome in a delivery routing problem to evaluate the validity of our results. Our results suggest that this method can be effectively applied to create carriageways anywhere in the world, as long as there is sufficient coverage by OpenStreetMap and an areal representation dataset of roads."
https://openalex.org/W4213005568,"Low-power consumption has been always a crucial design constraint for an efficient intellectual property based three-dimensional multi-core system that cannot be ignored easily. As the complexity increases due to the number of cores/stacks/ layers in 3D digital systems, the challenges to handle power can be more difficult at a high abstraction level. Therefore, the low-power approach gives designers an opportunity to estimate and optimize the power consumption in the early stages of design phases. The accurate power estimation through the macro-modeling approach at high-level reduces the risk of redesign cycle and turn-around time. In this research, we have presented an improved statistical macro-modeling approach that estimates power through statistical characteristics of randomly generated input patterns by using Biogeography Based Optimization. These input patterns propagate signals into an IP-based 3D digital test system. In experiments, the test system is based on four 8 to 32- bits heterogeneous cores. The response of the power is monitored by applying the well-known Monte Carlo Simulation technique. The entire power estimation method is performed in two major steps. First, the average power is estimated for an IP-based individual core. Second, the average power for bus-based Through-Silicon-Via is estimated. Finally, the cores and B-TSVs are integrated together to construct a 3D system. Then the average power for complete test systems is estimated. The experimental results of the statistical power macro-model are compared with the commercial Electronic Design Automation power simulator at the operating frequency of 100 MHz. The average percentage error of the test system is calculated as 8.65%. For the validation of these results, the statistical error analysis is additionally performed and reveals that our proposed macro-model is accurate in terms of percentage of error with a feasible amount of time."

https://openalex.org/W4213249057,"This article considers players' experiences seeking out new games to play, and their use of the Australian National Classification Scheme in doing so. The global video game industry is booming, with hundreds of games being released each month across numerous platforms. As a result, players have an unprecedented number of games available when choosing what games to purchase. However, a number of confounding issues around the emergent content of games and the subjective nature of game reviewing makes it difficult to relate what kinds of experiences a given game will facilitate. In this study, we surveyed game players in order to find their game platform and acquisition preferences; strategies and experiences when choosing games; and attitudes towards classification systems. Our findings suggest that players find it difficult to choose what games to purchase, and that existing classification systems are mostly only beneficial when choosing games for minors."
https://openalex.org/W4213413106,"Some birds exhibit a maxillary overhang, in which the tip of the upper beak projects beyond the lower mandible and may curve downward. The overhang is thought to help control ectoparasites on the feathers. Little is known about the extent to which the maxillary overhang varies spatially or temporally within populations of the same species. The colonial cliff swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) has relatively recently shifted to almost exclusive use of artificial structures such as bridges and highway culverts for nesting and consequently has been exposed to higher levels of parasitism than on its ancestral cliff nesting sites. We examined whether increased ectoparasitism may have favored recent changes in the extent of the maxillary overhang. Using a specimen collection of cliff swallows from western Nebraska, USA, spanning 40 years and field data on live birds, we found that the extent of the maxillary overhang increased across years in a nonlinear way, peaking in the late 2000's, and varied inversely with cliff swallow colony size for unknown reasons. The number of fleas on nestling cliff swallows declined in general over this period. Those birds with perceptible overhangs had fewer swallow bugs on the outside of their nest, but they did not have higher nesting success than birds with no overhangs. The intraspecific variation in the maxillary overhang in cliff swallows was partly consistent with it having a functional role in combatting ectoparasites. The temporal increase in the extent of the overhang may be a response by cliff swallows to their relatively recent increased exposure to parasitism. Our results demonstrate that this avian morphological trait can change rapidly over time."
https://openalex.org/W4213435996,"Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21 is an important regulator of glycemic control, but the association between circulating FGF21 and diabetic complications is poorly understood. Moreover, basal FGF21 secretion, especially in response to insulin dose, in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), has not been well examined. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the association of circulating FGF21 levels with diabetic complications and insulin dosage in middle-aged and elderly patients with T1DM.A total of 127 middle-aged and elderly patients with T1DM, including 68 patients with diabetic complications, and 106 non-diabetic individuals were analyzed in this cross-sectional study. Information on demographic characteristics and T1DM was extracted from their electronic medical records. Serum FGF21 levels were determined using ELISA.Serum FGF21 levels were significantly lower in T1DM patients (75.2 [37.4-135.1] pg/mL) than in non-diabetic participants (151.6 [92.0-224.6] pg/mL; P < 0.001). No diabetic complications were associated with serum FGF21 concentrations. Both basal and bolus insulin doses were significantly and positively correlated with serum FGF21 levels (P < 0.05). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that FGF21 level was associated with age and body mass index (P < 0.05), while the basal insulin dose was an independent positive predictor of serum FGF21 levels (β = 0.197, P = 0.032).Circulating FGF21 levels are reduced in patients with T1DM; however, they are not associated with diabetic complications. In addition, aging, obesity, and insulin dosage are positive determinants of circulating FGF21."
