https://openalex.org/W2000742689,"Flavonol glycosides constitute one of the most prominent plant natural product classes that accumulate in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. To date there are no reports of functionally characterized flavonoid glycosyltransferases in Arabidopsis, despite intensive research efforts aimed at both flavonoids and Arabidopsis. In this study, flavonol glycosyltransferases were considered in a functional genomics approach aimed at revealing genes involved in determining the flavonol-glycoside profile. Candidate glycosyltransferase-encoding genes were selected based on homology to other known flavonoid glycosyltransferases and two T-DNA knockout lines lacking flavonol-3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnosides (ugt78D1) and quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-glucoside (ugt73C6 and ugt78D1) were identified. To confirm the in planta results, cDNAs encoding both UGT78D1 and UGT73C6 were expressed in vitro and analyzed for their qualitative substrate specificity. UGT78D1 catalyzed the transfer of rhamnose from UDP-rhamnose to the 3-OH position of quercetin and kaempferol, whereas UGT73C6 catalyzed the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to the 7-OH position of kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside and quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, respectively. The present results suggest that UGT78D1 and UGT73C6 should be classified as UDP-rhamnose:flavonol-3-Orhamnosyltransferase and UDP-glucose:flavonol-3-O-glycoside-7-O-glucosyltransferase, respectively.

Flavonols constitute a major class of plant natural products (PNPs) 1The abbreviations used are: PNP, plant natural product; GT, glycosyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; UGT, family 1 glycosyltransferase; EST, expressed sequence tag.1The abbreviations used are: PNP, plant natural product; GT, glycosyltransferase; RT, reverse transcription; LC, liquid chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; UGT, family 1 glycosyltransferase; EST, expressed sequence tag. that share a common flavonoid nucleus and that accumulate in a wide range of conjugate structures. For example, over 350 different conjugate forms of a single flavonol, quercetin, have been observed to accumulate in plants to date (1Harborne J.B. Baxter H. The Handbook of Natural Flavonoids, Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Chichester, UK1999: 297-549Google Scholar). A large proportion of this structural variability is due to the attachment of one or several sugar moieties at different positions as illustrated in Fig. 1. Flavonoids, including flavonols, have recently attracted a lot of attention due to their proposed preventative role in coronary disease as a result of dietary intake (2Knekt P. Kumpulainen J. Jarvinen R. Rissanen H. Heliovaara M. Reunanen A. Hakulinen T. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). However, the uptake, metabolism, and biological effect of different flavonols and flavonol-conjugates vary greatly depending on the presence or absence and nature of the glycosidic structure (2Knekt P. Kumpulainen J. Jarvinen R. Rissanen H. Heliovaara M. Reunanen A. Hakulinen T. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2002; 76: 560-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar, 3Hollman P.C.H.

Nutr. 2000; 130: 1200-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The ability to engineer modified flavonol glycoside accumulation profiles in crop plants is therefore an interesting proposition in an effort to improve flavonol bioavailability (5Olthof M.R. Hollman P.C.H. Vree T.B. Katan M.B. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1200-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The enzymes involved in transferring sugars from a range of nucleoside donors onto acceptor molecules, glycosyltransferases (GTs), have been intensively studied recently (6Jones P. Vogt T.

Phytochem. 2003; 62: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Over 110 putative family 1 GTs (UGTs) have been postulated to exist in the genomic sequence of the model plant Arabidopsis (8Li Y. Baldauf S. Lim E.-K. Bowles D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4338-4343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 9Paquette S. Moller B.L. Bak S. Phytochem. 2003; 62: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). UGTs commonly utilize small molecular weight compounds as acceptor substrates and UDP-sugars as donors, and a large proportion of these predicted GTs are expected to act on PNPs. The functional determination of Arabidopsis UGTs in vitro is still limited to a handful of genes (10Lim E.-K. Li Y. Parr A. Jackson R.G. Ashford D.A. Bowles D.J. J. Biol.

Furthermore, whereas several flavonoid GTs, primarily acting on anthocyanidin and anthocyanin acceptor substrates, have been characterized at a molecular level in a range of species including Petunia hybrida (14Kroon J.

Although most anthocyanidin-GTs are capable of also glycosylating flavonols, closer examination of the enzyme kinetics has revealed a strong preference for anthocyanidins (18Ford C.M. Boss P.K. Høj P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9224-9233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and there is as yet only one report that describes a flavonol-exclusive GT (20Miller K.D. Guyon V. Evans J.N.S. Shuttleworth W.A. Taylor L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34011-34019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Hence, our current knowledge regarding the synthesis of several hundred different conjugate forms of flavonols is still in its infancy. Only recently were the structures of the major flavonoids in Arabidopsis revealed (21Veit M. Pauli G.F. J. Nat. Prod. 1999; 62: 1301-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Bloor S.J. Abrahams S. Phytochem. 2002; 59: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In an attempt to identify UGTs involved in determining the flavonol glycoside accumulation pattern of Arabidopsis, this paper reports on the in vitro and in planta characterization of two predicted UGTs (UGT78D1 and UGT73C6) that appear to be flavonol-specific in planta. The substrate specificities of both enzymes are novel with regards to sugar moieties and acceptor substrates, including the first in vitro characterization of a PNP rhamnosyltransferase (UGT78D1). Biochemicals and General Methods—All biochemicals were obtained from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, Wako, or Kanto and were all of analytical or higher grade. SDS-PAGE was performed using high Tris linear 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (23Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar), and polypeptides were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (R-250). Protein concentrations were estimated using bovine serum albumin as a reference (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence alignments were performed using NCBI-BLAST 2.0 (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J.

BASTA resistant, homozygous mutant plants (as described under “Mutant verification and Analyses of mRNA Expression”) were grown in Aratrays (Arasystem, Gent, Belgium) containing vermiculite in a plant growth room (18 h light, 4500 lux, 25 °C). Plant material employed in the analyses of organ expression was collected from plants grown in hydroponic culture (29Gibeaut D.M. Hulett J. Cramer G.R. Seemann J.R. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 317-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). All leaf and flower samples were harvested 4 weeks after germination. Mutant Verification and Analyses of mRNA Expression—For verification of T-DNA insertions, hybrid DNA fragments encompassing the left T-DNA borders and flanking plant DNA were amplified with the primers specified by Ref. 28Session A.

To confirm the absence of functional transcripts, total RNA were extracted from leaves or flowers sampled from individual mutant plants using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) or according to Ref. 30Richards K.D.

Complementary DNA was synthesized with ∼2 μg of RNA using an 18-base pair oligo-dT primer and Superscript II (GIBCO) according to manufacturer's instructions. Qualitative PCR reactions were performed using primers 78D1DiaF 5′-CATCGTCTTACCATCATCATG and 78D1DiaR 5′-ACATCGCCCCTCTCACGTTA for detection of UGT78D1 transcripts (30 cycles, annealing at 54 °C) and 73C6DiaF 5′-TGTGTTAACGTTCTGCGCAAGAACCG and 73C6DiaR 5′-TCAATTATTGGACTGTGCTAGTTGC for detection of UGT73C6 transcripts (32 cycles, annealing at 55 °C). Control reactions employed TUBF 5′-CCTGATAACTTCGTCTTTGG, and TUBR 5′-GTGAACTCCATCTCGTCCAT for detection of β-tubulin transcript. For semi-quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was extracted from roots, leaves, and stems in florescences according to Ref. 30Richards K.D. Schott E.J. Sharma Y.K. Davis K.R. Gardner R.

After spectrophotometric OD measurements, different RNA samples were equalized according to the ethidium bromide fluorescence encompassing the region of 25 S to 18 S rRNA bands after gel electrophoresis. Equal amounts were reverse transcribed by Superscript II (Invitrogen). For all genes analyzed the number of cycles was selected from the phase of linear amplification. The artificial control transcript pAW109 was added prior to reverse transcription and used for normalization (32Weig A. Deswarte C. Chrispeels M.J. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 1347-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).

The control cDNA derived from pAW109 RNA was amplified according to manufacturer's instruction (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany). Metabolite Analysis—Low molecular weight metabolites were extracted using 3 μl of extraction solvent (33Yamazaki M. Nakajima J.I. Yamanashi M. Sugiyama M. Makita Y. Springob K. Awazuhara M. Saito K.

All retention-times refer to absorbance at 340 nm. Synthesis and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The full-length EST clone AV521229 (UGT73C6) was obtained from Kazusa DNA Institute (Kisarazu, Japan) and sequenced to confirm the identity. The full-length coding sequences were amplified by PCR, cloned into pGEX-6p2 (Amersham Biosciences) after appropriate restriction digests, and verified by sequence analysis. UGT73C6 was amplified using AV521229 as template and primers 73C6GF 5′-AAGGATCCATGGCTTTCGAAAAAAACAACGAACC and 73C6GR 5′-AAGTCGACTCAATTATTGGACTGTGCTAGTTGCAT, UGT78D1 was amplified using first strand cDNA from leaves as template and primers 78D1GF 5′-GCTTCGAATTCCTTCTTATCATTCACTCACGAC and 78D1GR 5′-ATAGTCGACAGGTACAATGAAAATCAACAACCC. The expression vectors were used to express recombinant protein and soluble recombinant protein was purified as described previously (34Jones P.R. Manabe T. Awazuhara M. Saito K. J. Biol.

Synthesis and Analysis of UDP-rhamnose—Synthesis of UDP-rhamnose was performed essentially as described previously (35Kamsteeg J. van Brederode J. Kuipers-Tierie E. van Nigtevecht G. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 9: 457-464Google Scholar, 36Bar-Peled M. Lewinsohn E. Gressel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20953-20959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, ∼5 g of tobacco leaves were extracted in 2 volumes of ice-cold extraction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone) using mortar and pestle. The extract was filtered through a nylon mesh prior to centrifugation (15,000 × g, 15 min). The supernatant fraction was desalted >1000-fold by sequential filtration using Centricon Plus-20 centrifugal filter devices with a 5000 nominal molecular weight limit (Millipore) and dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The recovered desalted protein extract was frozen at –80 °C prior to use. UDP-rhamnose synthesis reactions (200 μl) included 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm NADPH, 1 mm UDP-glucose, and 100 μl of desalted protein extract. At the end of the incubation period (2 h, 38 °C), protein was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration through Amicon ULTRAFREE-MC 5,000 nominal molecular weight filter devices (Millipore), prior to storage at –80 °C. LC-MS analysis employed the equipment detailed above using a protocol developed by Tolstikov and Fiehn (37Tolstikov V.V. Fiehn O. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: LC separation was achieved using an TSK-GEL Amide-80 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm) (TOSOH) and a 0.5 ml/min flow-rate. Enzymatic Assays—10 mm stock preparations of all flavonoid substrates were dissolved as well as possible in 50% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide and heated to room temperature prior to use. Approximately 10–25 μg of crude bacterial protein was added to 50 μl of reaction mixture (0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin; 0.1–1 mm acceptor substrate; 80 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6); 4 ml of UDP-rhamnose preparation or 0.25 mm UDP-glucose) and incubated for 10 min (quantitative assays) or 30 min (qualitative assays) at 32 °C. Following the removal of protein from the reaction mixture by filtration through Amicon ULTRAFREE-MC 5,000 nominal molecular weight filter devices (Millipore), samples were analyzed by LC-MS as described above for metabolite analysis. Semi-quantitative specific activity comparisons considered both UVabsorption (340 nm) and the intensity of dominant ions as recorded by the MS for the estimation of end-product concentration. Nevertheless, where appropriate mono- and di-glycosidic standards were not available, such comparisons remain approximate at best. Choice of Candidate Flavonol GTs—Arabidopsis leaves accumulate kaempferol glycosylated at the hydroxyl-group of the 3-position (multiple sugars) and 7-position of the flavonol nucleus (Fig. 1) in the absence of UV-light, as reported in Refs. 21Veit M. Pauli G.F. J. Nat. Prod. 1999; 62: 1301-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar and 22Bloor S.J. Abrahams S. Phytochem. 2002; 59: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar. The results from the present paper suggest that quercetin-glycosides with similar structures to that of the kaempferol-glycosides also accumulate in flowers of wild type Arabidopsis (as described under “Identification of Missing Flavonol Glycosides”). The only report of a flavonoid-7-O-glycosyltransferase to date is that of a baicalein-7-O-glucosyltransferase from Scutellaria baicalensis (accession number AB031274) (38Hirotani M. Kuroda R. Suzuki H. Yoshikawa T. Planta. 2000; 210: 1006-1013PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, although many anthocyanidin-3-O-GTs have been described (7Vogt T. Jones P. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 380-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the only flavonoid-3-O-GT specific for flavonols is that of a flavonol-3-O-galactosyltransferase from P. hybrida (accession number AF165148) (20Miller K.D.

Our in silico approach toward finding candidates of novel Arabidopsis flavonol-GTs started with the identification of homologues to these known plant flavonoid-GTs for which evidence of expression was available as ESTs. The two strongest groups of Arabidopsis homologues to the S. baicalensis 7-GT included the UGT73B and UGT73C families, whereas the UGT78D family was the strongest candidate to the P. hybrida 3-GT (Table I). For this study UGT78D1 and UGT73C6 were chosen based on the availability of both ESTs and candidate mutant lines.Table IA. thaliana homologues to P. hybrida flavonol-3-O-galactosyltransferase ( 20Miller K.D.

The exact location of the T-DNA insertion in these candidate mutant lines was determined by sequencing PCR products obtained from genomic DNA using insert-specific and gene-specific primers. In both cases the T-DNA insertions were located within the open reading frames of the UGT genes (Fig. 2A). Qualitative reverse transcription PCR was then performed using RNA extracted from flowers or leaves of mutant lines and wild type Arabidopsis plants, confirming the absence of transcripts for both ugt73C6 and ugt78D1 mutant lines, respectively (Fig. 2B). Identification of Missing Flavonol Glycosides—The main flavonoids in leaves of unstressed Arabidopsis (Columbia var.) wild type, grown in a plant growth room void of sunlight, are kaempferol-glycosides, with a spurious and variable presence of anthocyanins at low concentrations (Fig. 3A). The ugt78D1 mutant could easily be spotted by an absence of the flavonoid that accumulates to the highest concentration in leaves of unstressed Arabidopsis, previously identified as kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside (Fig. 3B, 32.8 min, dominant ions m/z 579.2 (M + H+)), 433.1 (M + H+ – rhamnose), 287.4 (M + H+ – rhamnose – rhamnose) (21Veit M. Pauli G.F. J. Nat. Prod. 1999; 62: 1301-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 22Bloor S.J. Abrahams S. Phytochem. 2002; 59: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An equal scale mass spectra comparison, at 32.8 min, between wild type and ugt78D1 mutant leaf extracts clearly showed that no kaempferol-di-rhamnoside accumulated at all (Fig. 3, C compared with inset C2). The concentration of the other two main kaempferol-glycosides in ugt78D1 mutant leaves were greater compared with wild type lines. Flowers of wild type Arabidopsis also accumulate quercetinglycosides, in addition to kaempferol-glycosides, under the same growth conditions (Fig. 3D), although their structures are yet to be characterized. A tentative assignment of the main putative quercetin-glycosides based on mass spectra and comparisons with the already characterized kaempferol-glycosides includes: quercetin-glucoside-rhamnoside (26.1 min, dominant ions m/z 633.2 (M + Na+), 465.1 (M + H+ – rhamnose), 303.4 (M + H+ – rhamnose – glucose)), quercetin-glucoside-rhamnoside-rhamnoside (26.3 min, dominant ions m/z 779.3 (M + Na+), 611.1 (M + H+ – rhamnose), 449.1 (M + H+ – rhamnose – glucose), 303.4 (M + H+ – 2 × rhamnose – glucose)), quercetin-glucoside-rhamnoside (28.6 min, dominant ions m/z 633.2 (M + Na+), 449.1 (M + H+ – glucose), 303.4 (M + H+ – glucose – rhamnose)), and quercetin-rhamnoside-rhamnoside (30.6 min, dominant ions m/z 617.2 (M + Na+), 449.1 (M + H+ – rhamnose), 303.4 (M + H+ – 2 × rhamnose)). The relative order of elution, MS spectra and quantity of the three main quercetin-glycosides suggest that they share the same conjugate-structures as the three main kaempferol-glycosides. Two putative quercetin-glycosides (26.1 min and 30.6 min) were missing in flowers of ugt78D1 mutants (Fig. 3, D versus F) in addition to kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside-7-O-rhamnoside. The former peak (26.1 min) was also missing in ugt73C6 mutants (Fig. 3E). Expression of UGT78D1 and UGT73C6 in Arabidopsis Tissues—Because the metabolic phenotypes of UGT73C6 and UGT78D1 mutant lines were identified in leaves and flowers, the expression of both genes was examined in different Arabidopsis wild type tissues. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR and normalization via an externally added artificial reference transcript, the expression of both Arabidopsis flavonoid glycosyltransferases was analyzed in roots, rosette leaves, stems, inflorescences, and immature siliques (see “Experimental Procedures”). UGT78D1 was expressed at similar levels in leaves, flowers, siliques, and stems, whereas UGT73C6 was essentially restricted to leaves and flowers (Fig. 2C). Both genes were detectable only at very low levels in roots. As an internal control, β-tubulin expression was shown to be ubiquitously transcribed. In Vitro Characterization of Recombinant UGT78D1 and UGT73C6 —Recombinant UGT78D1 and UGT73C6 were expressed in Escherichia coli strains AD494 as glutathionine-S-transferase fusions. Affinity purification revealed homogenous preparations of the expected molecular mass (UGT73C6 80 kDa, UGT78D1 75 kDa) after SDS-PAGE (data not shown). However, the affinity-purified enzyme preparations rapidly lost activity and further assays were therefore conducted with crude extracts containing the respective recombinant GTs and compared with crude extracts prepared from bacteria harboring only the empty vector. The in planta data suggested that UGT78D1 encodes a flavonol-3-O-GT with UDP-rhamnose as the preferred donor nucleoside. However, UDP-rhamnose is not commercially available and was therefore synthesized using UDP-glucose as precursor and crude desalted plant extracts as a source of enzymatic activity as de"
https://openalex.org/W2085761963,"The dynamic processes of cell migration and invasion are largely coordinated by Rho family GTPases. The scaffolding protein IQGAP1 binds to Cdc42, increasing the amount of active Cdc42 both <i>in vitro</i> and in cells. Here we show that overexpression of IQGAP1 in mammalian cells enhances cell migration in a Cdc42- and Rac1-dependent manner. Importantly, cell motility was significantly decreased both by knock down of endogenous IQGAP1 using small interfering RNA and by transfection of a dominant negative IQGAP1 construct, IQGAP1ΔGRD. Cell invasion was similarly altered by manipulating intracellular IQGAP1 concentrations. Moreover, invasion mediated by constitutively active Cdc42 was attenuated by IQGAP1ΔGRD. Thus, IQGAP1 has a fundamental role in cell motility and invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2063616227,"The yeast genes MRS3 and MRS4 encode two members of the mitochondrial carrier family with high sequence similarity. To elucidate their function we utilized genome-wide expression profiling and found that both deletion and overexpression of MRS3/4 lead to up-regulation of several genes of the “iron regulon.” We therefore analyzed the two major iron-utilizing processes, heme formation and Fe/S protein biosynthesis in vivo, in organello (intact mitochondria), and in vitro (mitochondrial extracts). Radiolabeling of yeast cells with 55Fe revealed a clear correlation between MRS3/4 expression levels and the efficiency of these biosynthetic reactions indicating a role of the carriers in utilization and/or transport of iron in vivo. Similar effects on both heme formation and Fe/S protein biosynthesis were seen in organello using mitochondria isolated from cells grown under iron-limiting conditions. The correlation between MRS3/4 expression levels and the efficiency of the two iron-utilizing processes was lost upon detergent lysis of mitochondria. As no significant changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were observed upon overexpression or deletion of MRS3/4, our results suggest that Mrs3/4p carriers are directly involved in mitochondrial iron uptake. Mrs3/4p function in mitochondrial iron transport becomes evident under iron-limiting conditions only, indicating that the two carriers do not represent the sole system for mitochondrial iron acquisition.

Typical mitochondrial carrier proteins have a molecular mass of about 35 kDa, contain six membrane-spanning segments, and have a tripartite structure. Each of the three parts is made up of about 100 amino acids and shares sequence homology to the other modules of the proteins. Most members of the MCF are integral proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane and function in the shuttling of various metabolites and cofactors between the cytosol and mitochondria. The substrates of mitochondrial carrier proteins are rather diverse in size and composition, ranging from protons transported by the uncoupling protein up to large molecules such as ATP and ADP exchanged by the ADP/ATP carrier. Other members of this family are responsible for the transport of phosphate, citrate, fumarate/succinate, carnitine/acylcarnitine, flavine adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and other substrates. One member of the MCF has been located in peroxisomes where it was shown to transport ATP in exchange for AMP (4Palmieri L. Rottensteiner H. Girzalsky W. Scarcia P. Palmieri F. Erdmann R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5049-5059Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 35 open reading frames that encode members of the MCF (5El Moualij B. Duyckaerts C. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Sluse F.E.

(i) The functions of the encoded proteins are known, and their transport activities were investigated by expression in Escherichia coli and reconstitution of the purified proteins in liposome vesicles (e.g. Mir1p/PiC, phosphate (8Wohlrab H.

(ii) The substrates of mitochondrial carrier proteins encoded by the second group are predicted from investigations of mutant strains, but so far the carriers have not been reconstituted in liposome vesicles (e.g. Flx1p, FAD (13Tzagoloff A.

(iii) Several genes encoding members of the MCF were identified by genetic screens that did not immediately allow any conclusions with respect to their substrates (MRS3 and MRS4 (15Wiesenberger G.

Biol. 1998; 18: 5712-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)). (iv) Limited information from systematic studies is available for a few genes encoding predicted mitochondrial carrier proteins (19Lalo D. Stettler S. Mariotte S. Gendreau E. Thuriaux P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 20Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M.

Davis R.W. et al.Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3212) Google Scholar), while (v) nothing is known about the remaining open reading frames. The MRS3 and MRS4 genes were initially identified in a screen for multicopy suppressors of a mitochondrial RNA splicing defect (15Wiesenberger G. Link T.A. von Ahsen U. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Overexpression of either MRS3 or MRS4 suppresses the phenotype caused by depletion of Mrs2p (21Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Jank B. Teply R. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in Mg2+ transport (22Bui D.M.

Schweyen R.J. Schweigel M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1235-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Mrs3p (314 residues) and Mrs4p (304 residues) are closely related; they contain 76% identical and 87% similar amino acids over a stretch of 290 residues. With the exception of the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carriers (Aac1p, Aac2p, and Aac3p), which show identities/similarities ranging from 74/88% (Aac1p versus Aac3p) up to 90/97% (Aac2p versus Aac3p), they are the pair with the highest sequence similarity within the 35 yeast MCF members. Genome-wide transcription profiling indicated that MRS4 is co-induced with several iron-uptake genes in an AFT2–1up mutant, suggesting a role of this carrier in mitochondrial metal transport (24Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Another hint toward the function of Mrs3/4p comes from previous work by Foury and Roganti (25Foury F. Roganti T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24475-24483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) showing that (i) deletion of MRS3/4 in a frataxin deletion mutant (Δyfh1 cells) is able to suppress mitochondrial iron accumulation, (ii) overexpression of MRS4 in Δyfh1 cells leads to higher mitochondrial iron load, and (iii) overexpression of MRS4 in wild-type cells results in increased heme formation, pointing to a role of these carriers in mitochondrial iron homeostasis. To elucidate the function of Mrs3/4p we used genome-wide expression analyses and found that both deletion and overexpression of MRS3/4 lead to induction of the so-called iron regulon in S. cerevisiae. Genes of this regulon are under the control of the iron-sensing transcription activators Aft1p and Aft2p that induce gene transcription under iron-limiting conditions (24Rutherford J.C. Jaron S.

These observations prompted us to investigate the activities of the two major iron-utilizing processes, i.e. the biosynthesis of heme from protoporphyrin IX and the formation of cellular Fe/S proteins, in yeast cells either lacking or overexpressing both MRS3 and MRS4. Both biosynthetic reactions are performed in the mitochondrial matrix, yet little is known about how iron is imported into the organelles. This is mainly due to the fact that no mitochondrial iron transporters have been identified so far. Furthermore mechanistic studies on mitochondrial iron transport have been hampered by the fact that iron avidly associates with membranes (30Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, using heme synthesis and Fe/S protein biogenesis as an indirect, yet faithful measure for iron transport, it was shown recently that import of ferrous iron was dependent on a membrane potential and occurs independently of ATP (30Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 31Mühlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Gerber J. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29810-29816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Building on these studies, our investigations presented here reveal a clear correlation between the cellular MRS3/4 levels and the efficiency of both heme biosynthesis and Fe/S protein biogenesis in iron-deprived cells. Hence our findings strongly suggest a role of these carriers in mitochondrial iron uptake under iron-limiting conditions. Yeast Strains and Cell Growth—The following strains of S. cerevisiae were used: W303-1A (MATa, ura3–1, ade2–1, trp1–1, his3–11,15, leu2–3,112), which served as wild type, GW344-1b (W303-1A mrs3Δ::LEU2, termed Δmrs3), GW344-3c (W303-1A mrs4Δ::URA3, termed Δmrs4), GW344-6d (W303-1A mrs3Δ::LEU2 mrs4Δ::URA3, termed Δmrs3/4), and Δcyt2 (W303-1A, cyt2::LEU2; Ref. 32Zollner A. Rödel G. Haid A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Disruption of both MRS3 and MRS4 was performed in the diploid strain W303 using the short flanking homology gene disruption method (33Wach A. Brachat A. Rebischung C. Steiner S. Pokorni K. te Heesen S. Philippsen P. Brown A. Tuite M. Methods in Microbiology. Vol. 26. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 67-81Google Scholar) and confirmed by PCR analysis. One diploid (GW344), which was heterozygous for both MRS3 and MRS4, was sporulated, and tetrads were dissected. MATa segregants containing a disrupted MRS3 and/or a disrupted MRS4 gene were selected and used for further investigations. MRS3 and MRS4 were overexpressed in wild-type cells from plasmids pGW822 (MRS3; LEU2) and pGW821 (MRS4; URA3) under the control of the ADH1 promoter (see below). Cells were grown in rich (YP (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone)) and minimal (SC) media containing the desired carbon sources with or without FeCl3 (34Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar) or in lactate medium (35Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of Plasmids Overexpressing MRS3 or MRS4 —For pGW821, a 1.4-kb SspI-XbaI fragment containing the MRS4 open reading frame and 464 bp of the 3′ flanking sequences (note that XbaI site is not derived from MRS4 genomic sequence) was cloned into the blunted BamHI and the XbaI site of vector pVT102-U (36Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). For pGW822, a 2.5-kb PsiI-SmaI fragment containing the MRS3 open reading frame and 579 bp of the 3′ flanking region (note that SmaI site is not derived from MRS3 genomic sequence) was ligated into the blunted HindIII restriction site of vector pAAH5 (37Ammerer G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). RNA Isolation—For Northern blot analyses wild-type, Δmrs3/4, and MRS3/4n cells were grown as for in vivo labeling experiments (see below) and harvested at A 600 = 1, and RNA was prepared using the hot acidic phenol method (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Boston1993Google Scholar). For microarray analyses two sets of experiments were performed. First, wild-type cells and Δmrs3/4 cells were grown in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) to A 600 = 0.5 and harvested, and RNA was prepared essentially according to the hot acidic phenol method (38Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Boston1993Google Scholar) with the only difference being that three chloroform extractions were performed instead of one. Second, W303-1A transformed with pAAH5 and pVT102-U (wild type) and W303-1A transformed with pGW822 and pGW821 (MRS3/4n) were cultured in SD-Leu-Ura- and harvested at A 600 = 0.5; RNA was prepared as described above. DNA Microarray Analysis—Yeast DNA arrays were obtained from the Ontario Cancer Institute Microarray Centre. Reverse transcription, probe cleanup, and microarray hybridization were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Microarrays were read using an Axon GenePix 4000B laser scanner (Axon Instruments) and analyzed using the GenePix Pro 3.0 software. Experiments were repeated three times using independent cultures. 55Fe Incorporation into Fe/S Cluster Apoproteins and Heme in Vivo—In vivo labeling of yeast cells with radioactive iron (55FeCl3) and measurement of 55Fe incorporation into Fe/S proteins by immunoprecipitation and liquid scintillation counting was carried out as described previously (39Kispal G.

A. 2000; 97: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The following Fe/S reporter proteins were used: mitochondrial biotin synthase (Bio2p) and a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged version of cytosolic Rli1p (41Lange H. Lisowsky T. Gerber J. Mühlenhoff U. Kispal G. Lill R. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 715-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 42Mühlenhoff U. Richhardt N. Ristow M. Kispal G. Lill R. Hum. Mol.

Müller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). For the determination of heme formation in vivo, cells were radiolabeled with 55Fe for 2 h, cell lysates were extracted with butyl acetate, and the amount of 55Fe-labeled heme was determined by liquid scintillation counting as described previously (30Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 55Fe Incorporation into Fe/S Cluster Apoproteins and Heme in Vitro—The determination of Fe/S protein formation in intact mitochondria and in mitochondrial extracts in vitro was carried out as described previously using mitochondria isolated from Bio2p-overexpressing, iron-starved yeast cells (31Mühlenhoff U.

Heme formation of isolated mitochondria was determined as described previously (30Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 25 μg of mitochondria were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.6 m sorbitol) and incubated with 2 mm NADH at 25 °C for 3 min. Energized mitochondria were subsequently incubated with 2.5 μm deuteroporphyrin and 1 μCi of 55Fe for 10 min at 25 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 5 mm FeCl3 and 0.25 m HCl, heme was extracted with butyl acetate, and the amount of 55Fe-labeled heme was determined by liquid scintillation counting (30Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For each data set, a blank value measured in the presence of 10 μm carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone and in the absence of added NADH was subtracted (see Ref. 30Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For analysis of heme formation activities of ferrochelatase in mitochondrial extracts, 25 μg of mitochondria were incubated in 50 μl of buffer A containing 0.15% β-dodecylmaltoside for 2 min on ice. The lysed sample was diluted to 500 μl with buffer A and analyzed for 55Fe-labeled heme formation as described above. Determination of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—Relative membrane potentials of isolated mitochondria were estimated by fluorescence spectroscopy in a Kontron SMF25 spectrometer essentially as described previously (45Scaduto R.C. Grotyohann L.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The spectrometer was calibrated by setting the fluorescence emission at 590 nm of a 0.5 μm tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) solution to 100%. 100 μg of iron-starved mitochondria were resuspended in buffer A containing 0.5 μm TMRM, and the observed fluorescence emission at 590 nm was recorded. After 2 min, 1 mm NADH was added, and the fluorescence emission was recorded. These values were subtracted from the value obtained in the absence of NADH to obtain the amount of fluorescence quenching. Determination of Elemental Concentrations in Isolated Mitochondria by ICP-MS and ICP-AES—Mitochondria (400 μg of protein) were treated with 250 μl of concentrated nitric acid (69%, w/w, semiconductor quality; BASF, Ludwigshafen, Germany) at 70 °C for 1 h in an ultrasonic bath. The solution turned brown, and all solid matter dissolved. After cooling to room temperature the dissolution liquid was transferred into 10-ml polypropylene bottles and diluted with ultrapure water (Millipore Gradient and Elix, Millipore GmbH, Eschborn, Germany) to a 5-ml total volume. The blank of the nitric acid, the containers, and the buffers was below the limits of detection. The quantification was made using aqueous standards acidified to the same amount of nitric acid as that present in the dissolved mitochondria samples. The samples were analyzed using an atomic emission spectrometer (ICPAES Spectroflame P, Spectro A.I., Kleve, Germany) equipped with a N2-flushed UV monochromator for the measurement of very low wavelengths necessary for sensitive phosphorus determinations. The following lines were used for quantification by atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES): phosphorus, 177.500 nm; phosphorus, 178.290 nm; magnesium, 279.553 nm; manganese, 257.610 nm; zinc, 213.856 nm. The transition metals occurring at much lower concentrations were analyzed using an elemental mass spectrometer (ICP-MS VG Elemental Plasmaquad 2 Turbo+ STE, Thermo, Winsford, UK). The following isotopes were used for quantification: 26Mg, 55Mn, 57Fe, 59Co, 60Ni, 63Cu, 65Cu, 64Zn, and 66Zn. Typical concentrations of the elements in solution were low to mid ng/ml for the metals and μg/ml for phosphorus. Miscellaneous Methods—The following published methods were used: manipulation of DNA and PCR (46Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed.

The standard error of the determination of enzyme activities was between 5 and 15%. The iron content of mitochondria was determined as described previously (54Li J. Kogan M. Knight S.A. Pain D.

Deletion and Overexpression of Both MRS3 and MRS4 Causes Up-regulation of Genes Involved in Iron Homeostasis—We constructed a series of isogenic strains with identical auxotrophic markers where MRS3 and MRS4 are either deleted (termed Δmrs3/4 cells) or overexpressed under the strong constitutive ADH1 promoter (termed MRS3/4n cells). Overexpression of both MRS3 and MRS4 leads to a severe growth defect on media containing ethanol and glycerol as the sole carbon sources at 16, 28, and 36 °C and at 36 °C on glucose-containing media. Deletion of either MRS3 or MRS4 caused no significant phenotype, but simultaneous disruption of both genes resulted in a temperature-sensitive growth defect on fermentable and non-fermentable carbon sources (data not shown). We investigated the global transcriptional responses to changes in the expression levels of MRS3 and MRS4 using DNA microarray technology. Expression profiles of early logarithmic cultures of Δmrs3/4 and MRS3/4n mutant cells were compared with those of isogenic wild-type cells. Genes whose expression was significantly up- or down-regulated at least 1.5-fold are shown in Table I for the Δmrs3/4 mutant and in Table II for MRS3/4 overexpression. The complete data sets are available upon request. Interestingly both deletion and overexpression of MRS3 and MRS4 caused induction of genes of the “iron regulon.” This regulon contains genes for the high affinity iron transport system constituted by FET3 and FTR1 (55Askwith C.

In the case of Δmrs3/4 cells, no other genes were induced, while MRS3/4 overexpression caused up-regulation of several genes involved in, e.g. stress response and copper homeostasis. This finding is consistent with the more severe growth phenotype of MRS3/4n as compared with Δmrs3/4 cells. Genes down-regulated in Δmrs3/4 cells include LEU1 and GLT1 coding for Fe/S proteins (Table I). In MRS3/4n cells several genes involved in mitochondrial energy metabolism, as well as genes involved in transcription and translation, were repressed (Table II). These data indicate that the mitochondrial carrier proteins Mrs3/4p affect cellular iron metabolism either indirectly by performing a regulatory function or directly by participating in iron transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane.Table IGenes involved in iron homeostasis are induced in Δmrs3/4 cells Induction/reduction of gene expression is presented as the relative signals of the DNA array analysis observed with RNA extracted from Δmrs3/4 and wild-type cells. Standard deviation of three independent experiments is given.

https://openalex.org/W2086283039,"Exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vivo damages mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and interferes with mitochondrial transcription and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Because this damage accompanies oxidative stress and is reversible, we postulated that LPS stimulates mtDNA replication and mitochondrial biogenesis via expression of factors responsive to reactive oxygen species, i.e. nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor-A. In testing this hypothesis in rat liver, we found that LPS induces NRF-1 protein expression and activity accompanied by mRNA expression for mitochondrial transcription factor-A, mtDNA polymerase γ, NRF-2, and single-stranded DNA-binding protein. These events restored the loss in mtDNA copy number and OXPHOS gene expression caused by LPS and increased hepatocyte mitotic index, nuclear cyclin D1 translocation, and phosphorylation of pro-survival kinase, Akt. Thus, NRF-1 was implicated in oxidant-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis to provide OXPHOS for proliferation. This implication was tested in novel mtDNA-deficient cells generated from rat hepatoma cells that overexpress NRF-1. Depletion of mtDNA (ρo clones) diminished oxidant production and caused loss of NRF-1 expression and growth delay. NRF-1 expression and growth were restored by exogenous oxidant exposure indicating that oxidative stress stimulates biogenesis in part via NRF-1 activation and corresponding to recovery events after LPS-induced liver damage.

Physiol. 1998; 275: L139-LL44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects are associated with early receptor-mediated cytokine responses, e.g. production of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which initiate the early immune response (6Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). The hepatic response to LPS also includes activation of genes of mitochondrial recovery (4Suliman H.B. Carraway M S. Piantadosi C.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Of particular interest is that TNF-α accelerates ROS production by mitochondria (7Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 12Beyer H.S. Stanley M. Theologides A. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), whereas intense TNF receptor-1 stimulation produces cytotoxicity (13Cunningham P.N. Dyanov H.M. Park P. Wang J. Newell K.A. Quigg R.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5817-5823Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Mitochondria play crucial roles both in cell survival and death, and mitochondrial damage may initiate apoptosis, necrosis, or both. Mitochondria rely on an intrinsic genome (mtDNA) that is replicated and transcribed semi-autonomously but whose maintenance requires nuclear factors. The 16-kbp circular mtDNA contains limited genetic information relative to nuclear DNA; it encodes two rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 polypeptides of the electron transport chain (ETC). Mitochondrial transcription is regulated by mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA) that contains domains for high mobility group-box proteins critical for DNA promoter binding and transcriptional activation. Nuclear high mobility group-box proteins enhance transcription and structural organization of chromatin and exhibit dual DNA binding ability (14Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 15Wolffe A.P. Science. 1994; 264: 1100-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). mtTFA initiates transcription by binding to mtDNA upstream of control elements of both heavy and light strand promoters (16Moraes C.T. Kenyon L. Hao H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3345-3356Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The mtTFA knockout mouse shows mtDNA depletion and lack of OXPHOS, and dies early in embryogenesis, establishing the role of mtTFA in coordinating mitochondria-nuclear genomic activity and regulation of mtDNA copy number (17Larsson N.G. Wang J. Wilhelmsson H. Oldfors A. Rustin P. Lewandoski M. Barsh G.S. Clayton D.A. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Regulation of mtTFA transcription is not well understood, but loss of mitochondrial transcription inhibits cell growth because of lack of energy for cell replication. Two redox-responsive transcription factors, nuclear respiratory factors-1 and -2 (NRF-1 and NRF-2), have been implicated in its expression (18Scarpulla R.C. Bioenerg Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19Martin M.E. Chinenov Y. Yu M. Schmidt T.K. Yang X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25617-25623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as well as that of several ETC proteins (18Scarpulla R.C. Bioenerg Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 20Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NRF-1 is phosphorylated, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to DNA as a homodimer. Because NRF-1 is encoded in the nucleus but controls synthesis of ETC components, it is a candidate for linking nuclear and mitochondrial genome activity during repair of damage to both mitochondria and cells. A role for NRF-1 in the duality of mtTFA function in mtDNA replication and transcription has not been explored in the context of LPS damage, which led to the present investigation. The implication is that elucidating a role for NRF-1 in communication between nucleus and mitochondrion after LPS-induced mitochondrial damage could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying a major clinical problem, organ failure of severe sepsis. Animal protocols were approved by the Duke University Animal Care and Use Committee. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300–400 g were injected with a single dose of intraperitoneal LPS (Escherichia coli, 055 B5; Difco, Inc.) dissolved in 1 ml of sterile pyrogen-free 0.9% sodium chloride at a sub-lethal dose (1 mg/kg) chosen for significant but reversible hepatic injury (4Suliman H.B. Carraway M S. Piantadosi C.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Control animals were injected with an equal volume of 0.9% sodium chloride. Animals were killed 6, 24, and 48 h after injection, the abdomen was opened, and the livers were excised quickly and placed in cold isolation buffer. Fresh liver (4 g) was used to isolate mitochondria, and the remainder was snap-frozen and stored at –80 °C. For microscopy livers were flushed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and perfusion-fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The livers were removed, immersed in fixative for 2 h, and stored in 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C until paraffin embedding, sectioning, and staining for light microscopy. Highly purified, tightly coupled liver mitochondria were prepared as reported by discontinuous gradient centrifugation (1Taylor D.E. Ghio A.J. Piantadosi C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Simonson S.G. Welty-Wolf K. Huang Y.C. Griebel J.A. Caplan M.S. Fracica P.J. Piantadosi C.A. Circ.

Nuclei were obtained by centrifugation of liver homogenate at 1000 × g for 20 min and further purified by centrifugation through 1.75 m sucrose. Protein content was determined by BCA method (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), separated on 1.2% agarose gels, stained, and photographed. RNA was transferred to nylon membranes (Nytran Super Charge; Schleicher & Schuell) and UV cross-linked. PCR products were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP using random primers and Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Northern hybridization was done using QuickHyb (Stratagene). A γGCS (catalytic subunit) cDNA probe of 390 bp was used corresponding to nucleotides 79 to 468 of the rat sequence (21Yan N. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1588-1593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After hybridization, membranes were washed twice in 0.2% SSC (0.15 m NaCl/0.015 m sodium citrate) containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min then in 0.1% SSC/0.1% SDS at 60 °C for 45 min. The membranes were exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) to develop autoradiograms. Genomic DNA was extracted with a DNA extraction kit (DNA Isolator PS Kit; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), and DNA concentration was measured by optical density. mtDNA was prepared from rat liver mitochondria by NaI isolation (mtDNA Extractor WB kit; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and stored at –20 °C. Synthesis of mtDNA Mutant Fragments—A DNA fragment of 590 bp of cytochrome b was amplified by PCR using 14314 FW primer, 5′-CATCAGTCACCCACATCTGC-3′, and 14904RV, 5′-GGTTAGCGGGTGTATAATTG-3′, and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The cloned DNA fragment was truncated by 175 bp using BsmFI to generate an internal standard competitor of 415 bp. The competitor DNA was amplified in E. coli, extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by alcohol precipitation, separated into aliquots, and stored at –20 °C until use. Copy Number Determination by Competitive PCR—mtDNA copy number was quantified by competitive PCR based on co-amplification of target template with a known amount of competitor to account for variables affecting PCR amplification and assure a constant target/competitor ratio during amplification (22Suliman H.B. Majiwa P.A. Feldman B.F. Mertens B. Logan-Henfrey L. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The rat cytochrome b-specific primers amplify 590 bp of the target mtDNA and 415 bp of the competitor DNA. Triplicate samples containing 2 × 103 copies (unless otherwise indicated) of competitor and 50 ng of target mtDNA were co-amplified in a thermal cycler (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) at different cycle numbers optimized for visible product on ethidium bromide (EB)-stained gels in the PCR exponential phase. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose. The intensities of the EB-stained bands were measured by densitometry, and the ratio of mtDNA-specific product was plotted against competitor density on a log scale. Copy number was determined from the x intercept or the point at which the ratio of the 590- and 415-bp products was 1 (log 0). A correction factor of 1.4 was used to account for differences in molecular weights. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen), and 1 μg from each sample was reverse-transcribed (in a total volume of 20 μl) using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (180 units; Promega) in a reaction buffer containing random hexamer primers, dNTPs, and ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin (Promega). Gene transcripts were amplified in triplicate using gene specific primers (Table I). 18 S rRNA was used to control for variation in efficiency of RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and PCR for nuclear and mitochondrial RNA gene expression. Quantification of amplified mRNA was done by densitometry normalized to the 18 S rRNA mRNA signal density for each sample using image analysis software (Bio-Rad).Table IRT-PCR primer sequencesGeneSequence 5′-3′Product sizeAnnealing temperaturebp°CATPase 6SenseCCTCTTTCATTACCCCCACA32555AntisenseGAATTACGGCTCCTGCTCACytochrome cSenseGGAGGCAAGCATAAGACTG21355AntisenseGTCTGCCCTTTCTCCCTTCTCOX VSenseGTCACACGAGACAGATGA33958AntisenseCATCGAAGGGAGTTTACAmtSSBSenseAGCCAGCAGTTTGGTTCTTG28460AntisenseCCACTTTGCCTTCCACAAATmtTFASenseGCTTCCAGGAGGCTAAGGAT26455AntisenseCCCAATCCCAATGACAACTCNRF-1SenseCCACGTTGGATGAGTACACG26362AntisenseCTGAGCCTGGGTCATTTTGTNRF-2SenseCCGCTACACCGACTACGATT20660AntisenseACCTTCATCACCAACCCAAGPolγSenseGCCCATATCAGGGAGCAGTA25556AntisenseGTTGTGCACGTCTGCAAGAT Open table in a new tab Rat hepatoma cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (H4IIE; Manassas, VA) were characterized in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To deplete cells of mtDNA (ρo cells) normal H4IIE cells were cultured for 60 or more passages in the presence of 20 ng/ml EB in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 50 mg/ml uridine, and 100 mg/ml pyruvate to compensate for loss of respiration. Experiments were performed on cells 24 h post-confluence. One h before adding test agents cells were switched to phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Oxidant exposure of H4IIE (wild type) and mtDNA-deficient (ΔH4IIE) cells was produced with tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (t-BH). The t-BH (10–100 μm) diluted in serum-free medium was added to confluent monolayers in 6-well plates. Viability was assessed after trypsin release, staining with 0.4% trypan blue dye, and counting non-viable and total cells on a hemocytometer. PI3K inhibitor LY294002 was used at 50 μm. All measurements were performed in duplicate, and the experiments were repeated three times. Total DNA from H4IIE and respiration-deficient H4IIE clones was isolated, and 10-μg samples were digested to completion and separated by agarose electrophoresis. DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane as described (24Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar) and hybridized to the cytochrome b cloned probe labeled using Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences). Mitochondrial membrane potential was compared in wild type and ΔH4IIE cells using a cell permeant cationic fluorescent indicator, rhodamine-123 (5 μm; Molecular Probes), which is sequestered by active mitochondria in proportion to membrane potential (23Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). ROS production was estimated in cells immediately after 3 h of exposure to t-BH using dihydrorhodamine-123 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Dihydrorhodamine-123 accumulates primarily in mitochondria and is oxidized by ROS to rhodamine-123 (23Royall J.A. Ischiropoulos H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-123 fluorescence (excitation wavelength, 490 nm; emission, 535 nm) was measured on a microplate reader (Safire; Tecan US, Research Triangle Park, NC), and signal intensity was expressed qualitatively in relative units. Protein samples (nuclear or cytoplasmic) were separated by SDS-PAGE and prepared for immunoblot analysis (1Taylor D.E. Ghio A.J. Piantadosi C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with TBST (Tris-buffered saline/Tween) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 12 h at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated with antibody as follows: polyclonal rabbit anti-PCNA (1:1000; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA), polyclonal rabbit anti-cyclin D1 and Cdk4 (1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin (1:5000; Sigma), polyclonal rabbit anti-NRF-1 (1:8000; see Ref. 20Evans M.J. Scarpulla R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14361-14368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma), rabbit polyclonal anti-P-Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and rabbit polyclonal anti-Akt (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology). After five washes in TBST, membranes were incubated in a 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Protein expression was quantitated on digitized images from the center of the dynamic range and normalized to β-actin or tubulin in the same sample. At least four samples were used for each densitometry measurement. EMSA for NRF-1 was performed with [γ-32P]ATP polynucleotide kinase-labeled oligonucleotides annealed to double-strand oligonucleotides. Binding reactions were carried out on 20 μg of nuclear extract from liver or hepatoma cell nuclei. Binding assays were performed in a volume of 20 μl with 5 μg of bovine serum albumin and 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Preliminary experiments were performed to determine the range of nuclear protein that generated a linear signal response for the gel shift on autoradiographs. Control binding experiments were performed under conditions of mutant NRF-1 probe. For supershifts, the reactions included 1 μl of undiluted goat anti-NRF-1 antiserum. For competition, excess unlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated with nuclear extract before adding labeled oligonucleotide. After 20 min at room temperature, reaction mixtures were loaded on prerun 5% native polyacrylamide for 2.5 h at 10 V/cm, and the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The DNA oligonucleotide sequences used for EMSA were as follows (NRF-1 recognition sites are underlined): human mtTFA NRF-1A, 5′-CGCTCTCCCGCGCCTGCGCCAATT-3′; NRF-1B, 5′-GGGCGGAATTGGCGCAGGCGCGGG-3′. Control oligonucleotides were synthesized as follows (mutated regions underlined): muNRF-1C, 5′-CGCTCTCCGAAAATGAAAACAATT-3′; muNRF-1D, 5′-GGGCGGAATTGTTTTCATTTTCGG. Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistics were performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc comparison using computer software. A p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. n values refer to independent replicates. Regression analysis was performed using Statview (SAS, Version 5.0.1). Oxidative Stress and Hepatic Cell and Mitochondrial Injury after LPS—LPS depletes hepatic glutathione (GSH) and increases glutathione disulfide (GSSG/GSH) even in highly coupled mitochondria (4Suliman H.B. Carraway M S. Piantadosi C.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2003; 167: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar); this stress occurred within 6 h and recovered by 48 h (not shown). GSH recovery was associated with increased expression of the regulatory heavy catalytic subunit of γGCS (24Meister A. Anderson M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 711-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (5974) Google Scholar). The mRNA for γGCS heavy chain increased 4-fold by Northern analysis at 24 h after LPS (0.46 ± 0.10 at 0 h versus 1.87 ± 0.12 at 24 h; see Fig. 1A, p < 0.05). Competitive PCR demonstrated transient decreases in mtDNA copy number coincident with GSH depletion/recovery (Fig. 1B). mtDNA copy number decreased significantly 6 h after LPS, stabilized at 24 h, and had recovered by 48 h. This coincided with an increased hepatocyte mitotic index (Fig. 1C). Nuclear and Mitochondrial mRNA—Mitochondrial transcription was checked using gene-specific primers for mitochondrial mRNA for four mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 2A), COX I, ND1, and ATPase 6 referenced to nuclear 18 S rRNA. At 24 h significant decreases were found in ATPase 6, COX I, and ND1 transcripts (22 to 27%), which recovered at 48 h. Because mitochondrial mRNA is transcribed as single polycistronic molecules from mtDNA heavy chain, similar COX I, ND1, and ATPase 6 mRNA contents indicate near steady-state conditions. Message for nuclear-encoded Complex IV subunits (cytochrome c oxidase, COX IV, COX V), and cytochrome c were analyzed by RT-PCR normalized to the stable nuclear-encoded 18 S rRNA (Fig. 2B). COX IV and cytochrome c mRNA doubled 24 h after LPS whereas COX V mRNA did not change relative to 18 S rRNA. Mitochondrial DNA Replication—Mitochondrial biogenesis requires mtDNA replication under nuclear regulation. To investigate mtDNA regulation, we examined three nuclear genes encoding proteins for mtDNA replication (Fig. 3). DNA polymerase γ (Polγ) replicates mtDNA, mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) serves DNA replication, repair, and recombination, and mtTFA is the only currently known activator of mammalian mitochondrial transcription. Polγ, mtSSB, and mtTFA transcripts increased significantly by 6 h after LPS, further at 24 h, and by 48 h had declined toward pre-injury baseline. LPS Induced Protein Binding of NRF-1—The transcription factors NRF-1 and NRF-2 are involved in regulating expression of nuclear genes encoding major mitochondrial proteins that regulate mtDNA transcription and replication (18Scarpulla R.C. Bioenerg Biomembr. 1997; 29: 109-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of LPS on NRF-1 activation by EMSA. An increase in NRF-1 binding was evident at 6 h after LPS exposure. Approximately 70% of the increase in NRF-1 protein binding was lost 24 h after LPS exposure (Fig. 4A). To confirm specificity of NRF-1 binding, we performed supershift assays with anti-NRF-1 antibody, and a mutated oligonucleotide sequence for NRF-1 interfered with protein binding (Fig. 4B). The murine NRF-1 peptide sequence revealed an Akt phosphorylation motif (RXRXX(S/T)) at position 104–109. Therefore, we assessed Akt activation by Western blot using anti-Akt and anti-phospho-Akt antibodies. To activate Akt fully, phosphorylation of two sites is necessary, one in the activation domain, and the other in the COOH-terminal hydrophobic motif (25Neri L.M. Borgatti P. Capitani S. Martelli A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Phospho-Akt increased significantly 6 h after LPS treatment and declined by 24 h but remained above baseline (Fig. 4C). LPS Induced Expression of NRF-2—We analyzed changes in NRF-2 mRNA by RT-PCR in liver after LPS. NRF-2 is also a nuclear regulatory protein for mitochondria; its mRNA was expressed at low levels in control liver (Fig. 4D), but transient NRF-2 mRNA induction was found within 6 h of LPS injection followed by a decline over the next 24 h (Fig. 4D). Up-regulation of NRF-2 expression is novel, and probable transcriptional regulation of this gene has not been demonstrated before. Cell Growth Regulatory Proteins—Cell cycle activation evaluated with a PCNA marker was increased significantly (p < 0.05) by LPS at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 5A). To determine whether G1 cyclin expression accompanied recovery from LPS injury, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase-4 (Cdk4) expression were checked by Western analysis in liver nuclei and cytoplasm (Fig. 5B). At 24 h, cytoplasm and nuclear cyclin D1 protein levels were stable and nearly undetectable, but G1 cyclin was found after 48 h in both cytoplasm and nuclei (Fig. 5B). In comparison, Cdk4 constitutively present in control cytoplasm was equivocal in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic Cdk4 was unaffected by LPS, but the nucleoprotein was expressed significantly by 48 h (p < 0.05) (Fig. 5B). Nuclear translocation of D1 and Cdk4 indicate cell cycle progression. Respiration-deficient Cells—To assess the relationship between mitochondria and hepatic cell proliferation we selected a rat hepatoma (H4IIE) cell line that constitutively expresses NRF-1 and mtTFA and generated mtDNA depleted clones. Southern analysis of DNA from parental (H4IIE) and EB derivative cells identified two clones (ΔH4IIE and 1ΔH4IIE) as mtDNA-deficient cells (>98% reduction of the mtDNA content) (Fig. 6A). These cells grew slowly, depended on glycolysis, and required pyruvate and uridine (not shown). Both clones responded similarly, but the reported data were obtained from clone ΔH4IIE. To assess nuclear genes that control mitochondrial biogenesis, we examined mRNA for transcription factors NRF-1 and mtTFA in H4IIE and ΔH4IIE cells. Fig. 6B shows expression of NRF-1 and mtTFA relative to 18 S rRNA mRNA by RT-PCR in control and mtDNA-depleted cells. Depletion of mtDNA significantly down-regulated biogenesis gene expression in ΔH4IIE cells compared with H4IIE cells (Fig. 6C). Deletion of mtDNA decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential and ROS generation relative to control cells as determined using fluorescence techniques (Fig. 7). The ΔH4IIE cells, like H4IIE cells, took up the fluorescent dye rhodamine-123 initially but lost it rapidly, whereas H4IIE cells retained the dye (Fig. 7A). The effect of mtDNA depletion on ROS generation was assessed by oxidation of dihydrorhodamine (Fig. 7B). In comparing parent (H4IIE) with mtDNA-deficient (ΔH4IIE) cells, significantly less fluorescence was detected in ΔH4IIE cells, but t-BH exposure caused both cell types to accumulate fluorescence signal in the mitochondria. Strong oxidants such as t-BH affect cell growth and viability by both direct oxidation and through secondary ROS generation (26Kandel E.S. Hay N. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 210-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). In H4IIE and ΔH4IIE cells, viability was decreased significantly in a concentration-dependent manner after exposure to t-BH at concentrations of 50 μm or above for 24 h (not shown). However, lower concentrations of t-BH had either no effect or stimulated growth. To avoid cytotoxicity, proliferation studies were performed using 15 μm t-BH, which enhanced ΔH4IIE cell growth (and survival) significantly, restoring it almost to the level of control cells. H4IIE cells exhibited slight increases in growth rate at 24 to 48 h with t-BH (Fig. 7C). Translocation of mtDNA Regulatory Proteins—Translocation and binding of transcription factors NRF-1 and -2 induce mt-TFA expression in response to oxidative damage of mtDNA (27Paraidathathu T. de Groot H. Kehrer J.P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 28Asuncion J.G. Millan A. Pla R. Bruseghini L. Esteras A. Pallardo F.V. Sastre J. Vina J.

Unambiguous interaction, first observed with the yeast two-hybrid system, was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation studies using cell-free transcription/translation and transient cell transfection assays. The interaction of progranulin with perlecan domain V involved the first two laminin- and epidermal growth factor-like repeats. Within progranulin, the subdomains interacting most with perlecan harbored granulins F and B. Kinetics analysis of the interaction using surface plasmon resonance showed a saturable binding of relative low affinity (KD ∼1 μm). These results were supported by significant expression overlap of these two proteins in a series of ovarian tumor tissue microarrays. Progranulin was present within proliferating blood vessels of ovarian carcinomas and perivascular matrices, with a distribution similar to perlecan. Notably, both progranulin and domain V stimulated the growth of adrenal carcinoma cells. However, when used together in equimolar amounts, the two proteins counteracted each other's activity. Thus, progranulin/perlecan interaction could contribute to a fine regulation of tumor angiogenesis and could ultimately affect cancer growth.

Thus, progranulin/perlecan interaction could contribute to a fine regulation of tumor angiogenesis and could ultimately affect cancer growth. Perlecan, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan found in nearly all basement membranes and cell surfaces, has a complex structure based on seven protein modules arranged in five distinct domains (1Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The individual domains of perlecan interact with a variety of macromolecules. For example, the C-terminal domain V, which harbors three laminin G (LG) 1The abbreviations used are: LG, laminin G-like module; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin epitope. modules separated by four epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, interacts with laminin and collagen Type IV and serves as an attachment substrate for various cells (2Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar). Domain V interacts with fibulin-2, β1-integrin, heparin (3Brown J.C. Sasaki T. Göhring W. Yamada E. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), collagen Type XVIII (4Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17491-17499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Perlecan is deposited in all vascularized tissues where it maintains structural integrity through its interaction with other basement membrane components (6Murdoch A.D. Liu B. Schwarting R. Tuan R.S.

Dyn. 1997; 210: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Genetic evidence for the role perlecan of in vasculogenesis derives from the complex phenotype of perlecan null mice. The majority of these mutant mice perish at day 10.5 of embryogenesis because of increased blood vessel pressure (8Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Watanabe E. Takami H. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 354-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Surviving mice die shortly after birth and exhibit extreme vascular and cephalic abnormalities (8Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Watanabe E.

González-Iriarte M. Fässler R. Munoz-Chápuli R. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In addition to these structural functions, perlecan affects cell proliferation, tumor invasion, and angiogenesis primarily by modulating the activity of growth and angiogenic factors (11Iozzo R.V. San Antonio J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). For instance, perlecan protects bioactive molecules from proteolytic degradation and misfolding, and the subsequent regulated cleavage by proteases provides a mechanism by which vital growth factors are released to induce multiple signaling cascades (12Whitelock J.M. Murdoch A.D. Iozzo R.V. Underwood P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10079-10086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Perlecan is highly enriched in various tumorigenic cell lines and tumors (13Cohen I.R. Murdoch A.D. Naso M.F. Marchetti D. Berd D. Iozzo R.V.

Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 130-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Notably, a similar distribution (18Daniel R. He Z. Carmichael K.P. Halper J. Bateman A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 999-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) and some overlapping functions are shared by progranulin (19Bhandari V. Palfree R.G.E. Bateman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Progranulin is a large, secreted precursor of 593 amino acids, which contains seven and one-half protein repeats of ∼6 kDa called granulins (24Bateman A. Bennett H.P.J. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The granulins are characterized by a highly conserved motif of 12 cysteine residues consisting of four cysteine pairs flanked by two single cysteine residues near their respective N and C termini. Individually, several granulins are biologically active (24Bateman A. Bennett H.P.J. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 158: 145-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that the entire progranulin is functional (25He Z. Bateman A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3222-3229PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhu J. Nathan C. Jin W. Sim D. Ashcroft G.S.

In the present study we discovered a novel interaction between the perlecan domain V and progranulin, an interaction that could modulate tumor growth. Yeast Two-hybrid Library Screening—The screening was done with the Matchmaker GAL4 system (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Assays for α- and β-galactosidase, growth in quadruple minus (Trp–, Leu–,His–,Ade–) media, and liquid assay quantification of β-galactosidase activity were performed as described previously (5Mongiat M.

Co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc or anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies (Clontech) was as described previously (5Mongiat M. Fu J. Oldershaw R. Greenhalgh R. Gown A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

For co-precipitation in mammalian cells, we generated domain V-expressing 293-EBNA cells by culturing in puromycin (1 μg ml–1) for at least 4 weeks. Following verification of domain V expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microsequencing (4Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol.

As a further control, we transfected wild type 293-EBNA cells with the progranulin construct. After 48 h, the conditioned media were collected and filtered, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science) was added. Rabbit polyclonal anti-domain V antiserum was added (1:200 dilution), and the proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 16 h. Sepharose-G beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and incubated for 4 h, washed four times, boiled, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (4Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J.

Binding of domain V to progranulin was determined with a Biacore™ 2000 (Biacore) using previously described parameters (31Sweeney S.M. DiLullo G. Slater S.J. Martinez J. Iozzo R.V. Lauer-Fields J.L. Fields G.B. San Antonio J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30516-30524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Initially, the progranulin was captured on individual channels of the surface of a CM5 sensor chip by amine coupling. Solutions containing domain V in elution buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at the required concentration were then injected over each surface, and the response was measured as a function of time. After subtraction of the contribution of bulk refractive index changes and nonspecific interactions with the CM5 chip surface (typically <1%), the individual association (ka) and dissociation (KD) rate constants were obtained by global fitting of data to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, using BIAevaluation™. These values were then used to calculate the dissociation constant (KD). Growth was assayed with CellTiter 96® proliferation assay (Promega). Immunohistochemistry of ovarian cancer tissue (n = 50) microarrays (BioGenex) was performed as described previously (5Mongiat M. Fu J. Oldershaw R. Greenhalgh R. Gown A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17491-17499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To identify novel interacting partners for the perlecan protein core, we employed perlecan domain V as bait (Fig. 1A) and screened a human keratinocyte cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system (32Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar). Domain V was initially cloned into the pGBK-T7 vector and was tested by itself to ensure that it did not activate the reporter genes HIS3 and ADE. As a control for positive interactions, all constructs were also tested as either bait or prey and for growth in double minus (Trp–/Leu–) media. One of the fastest growing clones (clone A12) contained an ∼0.9-kb cDNA insert (Fig. 1B) which encoded the 17-amino acid signal peptide and the first 254 residues (Thr1–Leu254) of the mature progranulin (19Bhandari V. Palfree R.G.E. Bateman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), including the partial granulin p, and granulins G, F, and B (Fig. 1C). The cDNA was in frame with the activating domain of the plasmid, further supporting the concept of a real protein-protein interaction. We then subcloned clone A12 into the pGADT7 vector, and the interaction with domain V was tested with the yeast two-hybrid system on a one-to-one basis. The growth of the cells in quadruple minus media was comparable with the positive control and also with the activity of α-galactosidase (Fig. 1D). Next, we analyzed the precise site of progranulin interaction within perlecan domain V. To this end, we generated seven deletions of domain V in the pGBKT7 (bait) vector (Fig. 2A). The plasmids were co-transfected with the pGADT7-progranulin (prey) vector into AH109 yeast cells, and the cells were plated on selective media. Robust growth was observed in cells co-transfected with progranulin and either full-length domain V, Δ1, or Δ2. Moderate growth was observed only with Δ5, but minimal or no growth was observed with the other deletion mutants (Fig. 2A). These results were strengthened by qualitative (not shown) and quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assays, which utilize a sensitive chemiluminescence detection system (Fig. 2B). The results indicate that LG1 and EGF1–2 together are the strongest binding sites for progranulin, based on the robust reaction of Δ2. However, individually, they do not interact significantly with progranulin because Δ3 and Δ4 showed minimal growth (Fig. 2A) and β-galactosidase activity (Fig. 2B). However, Δ5 was consistently reactive and showed lower, but still significant levels of β-galactosidase activity. Thus, we conclude that the major site of progranulin interaction resides within LG1 and EGF1–2, but LG2/EGF3–4 can substitute reasonably effectively. Next, we determined the precise site of perlecan domain V interaction within progranulin. First, we generated a full-length progranulin by ligating into clone A12 two expressed sequence tags that encode granulins A, C, and D (NCBI 2171326) and E (NCBI 6007270), respectively. The sequence matched the 593 amino acid residues of progranulin (19Bhandari V. Palfree R.G.E. Bateman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 20Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Neubauer M.G. Buckley S.D. McDonald V.L. Todaro G.J. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13073-13078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We then subcloned progranulin into the pGBKT7 vector (bait) and generated three additional C-terminal deletions (Fig. 3A). The plasmids were co-transfected with the pGADT7-domain V (prey) vector into AH109 cells, and the cells were plated on selective media. Strong growth was observed in cells co-transfected with domain V and either full-length progranulin or Δ1 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, Δ2 gave reduced growth and Δ3 minimal growth. These results, corroborated by quantitative β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 3B), clearly show that the main binding site resides within granulins B and F. To strengthen the interaction obtained with the yeast two-hybrid system, the two proteins were in vitro transcribed and translated and subjected to co-immunoprecipitation. The bait construct conferred a Myc epitope to perlecan domain V, whereas the prey construct conferred an HA epitope to progranulin. The translated proteins were first analyzed on SDS-PAGE, and bands corresponding to the predicted sizes of the molecules, i.e. ∼81 kDa for domain V and ∼34 kDa for progranulin (clone A12), were obtained (Fig. 3C, left panel). Notably, anti-Myc and anti-HA monoclonal antibodies co-precipitated both proteins (Fig. 3C, right panel). In contrast, no protein was precipitated when empty plasmids were used. The yeast two-hybrid system is an established method for investigating protein-protein interactions involved in intracellular events. However, only recently has the method been used to study interactions between secreted proteins (4Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 5Mongiat M. Fu J. Oldershaw R. Greenhalgh R. Gown A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17491-17499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 26Zhu J. Nathan C. Jin W. Sim D. Ashcroft G.S. Wahl S.M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wright C.D. Ding A. Cell. 2002; 111: 867-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), in part because glycosylation and disulfide bond formation might not be correctly reproduced in the yeast cytosol. This is particularly critical for the proteins in this study, insofar as progranulin and domain V contain 88 and 30 cysteine residues, respectively. Thus, we confirmed the specificity of the interaction using transient transfection in human 293-EBNA cells, harboring the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen, that previously have been shown to allow proper glycosylation and secretion of a variety of proteins, including perlecan (4Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). When the cells were doubly transfected with progranulin- and domain V-containing vectors, the two proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-domain V antiserum and detected with either anti-progranulin or anti-domain V antibodies (Fig. 3D). In contrast, untransfected cells showed no reactive bands. Next, we generated recombinant full-length progranulin and domain V in 293-EBNA cells (Fig. 4A) and utilized these proteins to test their real-time interaction using surface plasmon resonance. Kinetics analysis of the interaction between soluble domain V and progranulin immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip gave a saturable binding with KD = 1.21 ± 0.54 μm (ka (m–1 s–1) = 5.49 ± 1.22 × 105; k D (s–1) = 0.51 ± 0.20 × 10–1). We then tested the effects of progranulin and domain V on the growth of SW-13 adrenal carcinoma cells, known to respond to progranulin (25He Z. Bateman A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3222-3229PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, in dose-response experiments using protein concentrations between 0.01 nm and 1 μm for 2 days in 0.5% serum, both progranulin and domain V stimulated the growth of SW-13 cells (Fig. 4B), with paradoxically maximal stimulation at the lower dosages. For progranulin, this behavior has been observed previously (20Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Neubauer M.G. Buckley S.D. McDonald V.L. Todaro G.J. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13073-13078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is due, most likely, to differential processing by elastase of the progranulin precursors with generation of progranulin B, which inhibits the growth of SW-13 (26Zhu J. Nathan C. Jin W. Sim D. Ashcroft G.S. Wahl S.M. Lacomis L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Wright C.D. Ding A. Cell. 2002; 111: 867-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). For perlecan domain V, the report of these effects was new. To establish the specificity of these effects, we repeated the same experiment using skin fibroblasts and found no significant changes in their growth rates (not shown). Finally, we tested the effects of increasing progranulin concentrations (0.01 nm–1 μm) in the presence of a constant concentration (100 nm) of domain V. There was neither an additive nor a synergistic effect; on the contrary, interaction between progranulin and domain V led to a marked suppression of their respective mitogenic activities (Fig. 4C). Because perlecan and progranulin are strongly expressed in the ovary and in ovarian cancer (2Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1344) Google Scholar, 27Jones M.B. Spooner M. Kohn E.C. Gynecol. Oncol. 2003; 88: S136-S139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we investigated the expression of these two proteins in a series (n = 50) of tissue microarrays derived from various types of ovarian tumors. Progranulin was present within proliferating blood vessels of ovarian carcinomas (Fig. 4, D and F), with a distribution similar to perlecan (Fig. 4, G and I). Progranulin and perlecan also co-localized within the stroma and the perivascular spaces of ovarian cancer (Fig. 4, E and H, asterisk). In addition, progranulin was localized within scattered ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 4F). Collectively, these studies substantiate the protein-protein interaction reported above and further indicate that the perlecan protein core could interact in vivo with progranulin within the newly formed tumor blood vessels. In this study, we provide several independent lines of evidence for a physiological interaction between the C terminus of perlecan protein core and progranulin. First, while screening a human keratinocyte library using perlecan domain V as bait, we identified a novel molecule interacting with the perlecan protein core. Once we had corroborated the interaction using the yeast two-hybrid system and one-to-one transfections, we then identified the interactive regions within the respective molecules. Using a battery of deletion mutants, we demonstrated that the major site of interaction within perlecan was complex and included the first two LG and EGF modules. Within progranulin, the subdomains that interact most with perlecan harbored granulins F and B. Second, the specificity of the interaction was substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using cell-free transcription/translation systems as well as transient cell transfection. A nonspecific electrostatic interaction between progranulin and perlecan domain V is less likely insofar as they have a very similar net negative charge of –17.53 and –17.05, respectively, at pH 7.5. Third, the potential physiologic relevance of complex formation between progranulin and perlecan was corroborated by an interaction using a biosensor chip and by their overlapping tissue distribution. Fourth, we discovered that although both progranulin and domain V caused enhanced growth of SW-13 cells, when supplemented together, their mitogenic activity was neutralized. Notably, progranulin was associated with blood vessels similarly to perlecan, and it has recently been shown that recombinant progranulin not only stimulates the growth of various tumor cells but also the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells (29He Z. Ong C.H.P. Halper J. Bateman A. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). We recently discovered that perlecan domain V is a potent anti-angiogenic factor and have named it endorepellin, to signify its anti-endothelial function (4Mongiat M. Sweeney S. San Antonio J.D. Fu J. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4238-4249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Because proteolytic processed forms of several basement membrane proteins can directly affect blood vessel formation and tumor growth, a biological consequence of progranulin/perlecan interaction is that they might tune each other's biological activity, which could contribute to a fine regulation of tumor angiogenesis and ultimately affect cancer growth and metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W1972945472,"Using Ebony protein either expressed in Escherichia coli or in Schneider S2 cells, we provide evidence for its substrate specificity and reaction mechanism. Ebony activates β-alanine to aminoacyladenylate by an adenylation domain and covalently attaches it as a thioester to a thiolation domain in a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) related mechanism. In a second reaction, biogenic amines act as external nucleophiles on β-alanyl-S-pantetheine-Ebony, thereby releasing in a fast reaction the dipeptide (peptidoamine) in a process that is novel in higher eucaryotes. Therefore, we define Ebony as a β-alanyl-biogenic amine synthetase. Insight into the reaction mechanism stems from mutational analysis of an invariant serine that disclosed Ebony as a multienzyme with functional analogy to the starting modules of NRPSs. In light of a putative biogenic amine-deactivating capacity, Ebony function in the nervous system must be reconsidered. We propose that in the Drosophila eye Ebony is involved in the transmission process by inactivation of histamine through β-alanyl conjugation.

Carnegie Inst. 1923; 327: 50Google Scholar) affects cuticle tanning and sclerotization as well as nervous system functions like vision (2Hotta Y. Benzer S. Nature. 1969; 222: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and behavior (3Kyriacou C.P. Burnett B. Connolly K. Anim. Behav. 1978; 26: 1195-1206Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 4Newby L.M. Jackson F.R. J. Neurogenet. 1991; 7: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Previous biochemical investigations (5Perez M. Wappner P. Quesada-Allue L.A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 6Wright T.R.F. Scandalios J.G. Caspari E.W. Advances in Genetics. Vol. 24. Academic Press, Inc., San, Diego1987: 127-209Google Scholar) led to the conclusion that Ebony has β-alanyl-dopamine synthetase function. The visual phenotype of ebony is reflected by a reduced phototaxis and optomotor response (7Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Heisenberg M. J. Comp. Physiol. 1972; 80: 119-136Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on electroretinogram measurements that lack “on” and “off” transients, the visual phenotype has been attributed to altered responses in cells postsynaptic to the terminals of retinula cells R1-R6 of the lamina (2Hotta Y. Benzer S. Nature. 1969; 222: 354-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 9Heisenberg M. J. Exp. Biol. 1971; 55: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar). Histamine, which has been identified as neurotransmitter at these terminals, is released when retinula cells are depolarized (10Sarthy P.V. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Because Ebony is expressed in the lamina glia surrounding the photoreceptor terminals that lack dopamine immunoreactivity, we previously proposed that glial expression reflects histamine conjugation to β-alanine (11Richardt A. Rybak J. Stortkuhl K.F. Meinertzhagen I.A. Hovemann B.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 452: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from the elucidation of histamine metabolism in fly heads (12Borycz J. Borycz J.A. Loubani M. Meinertzhagen I.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10549-10557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supported our above-mentioned hypothesis. Throughout fly development, the optic neuropile is not the sole but the major site of ebony expression in the nervous system (11Richardt A. Rybak J. Stortkuhl K.F. Meinertzhagen I.A. Hovemann B.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 452: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Hovemann B.T. Ryseck R.-P. Walldorf U. Störtkuhl K.F. Dietzel I.D. Dessen E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This finding raised the intriguing possibility that β-alanylation reflects an as yet unknown general pathway for biogenic amine neurotransmitter inactivation. A direct approach and first step to support this hypothesis therefore is to determine the biochemical activity of purified Ebony protein in vitro. Along these lines, it is important to consider that the close relationship of Ebony to the family of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) 1The abbreviations used are: NRPS, nonribosomal peptide synthetase; P-pant, phosphopantetheinyl; e-cDNA, ebony-cDNA; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; WT, wild type; UAS, upstream activating sequence. should be reflected by a comparable reaction mechanism of peptide bond formation (Fig. 1). NRPSs are of modular structure with each module incorporating one amino acid into the final product. Amino acid binding to the module is a rather specific two-step process, which involves selection of the cognate amino acid and activation as aminoacyladenylate in the adenylation domain followed by transfer to a 4′-phosphopantetheinyl (P-pant) group attached to an invariant serine of a neighboring thiolation domain (Fig. 2). A comparison of the Ebony amino acid sequence with that of known NRPSs reveals solely the core motifs of a putative adenylation and thiolation domain, an arrangement that is normally found in initiation modules (Fig. 3). Therefore, only the initial step of the reaction, namely amino acid activation, can follow the thiotemplate mechanism described for NRPSs (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the C-terminal 230 amino acids of the Ebony protein do not share homology with any known NRPSs and might represent a novel type of domain responsible for the selection of dopamine. In this report, we provide evidence by mutational analysis and in vitro assays that Ebony exclusively activates one substrate amino acid, β-alanine, in a two-step process hitherto only known from microbial peptide synthetases. However, nucleophilic release of β-alanine is not restricted to dopamine alone but instead Ebony accepts a variety of biogenic amines.Fig. 3Ebony gene organization and NRPS sequence homology. In 15 kb of genomic ebony DNA, SalI (S), XhoI (X), and BamHI (B) restriction sites are shown. Filled boxes indicate the seven ebony gene exons. The lower bar delineates the genomic DNA cloned in front of gal4 to facilitate ebony-like cuticle expression in an ebony-gal4 transformant line. In the blow up, a bar comprising the ebony reading frame and the sites of homology to NRPS consensus core sequences A1–A10 and T (29Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar) are indicated. The degree of amino acid conservation in Ebony as compared with the NRPS consensus sequence is listed below.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fly Stocks—Drosophila melanogaster were cultured on standard corn meal medium. The wild type strain examined was Canton-S. w1118 ; In(3R)eAFA (14Hazelrigg T. Levis R. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1984; 36: 469-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 15Caizzi R. Ritossa F. Ryseck R.-P. Richter S. Hovemann B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 66-70Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) served as ebony null mutant in white background for rescue transformation. EbonyHis-6 Production in S2 Cells—The complete ebony reading frame was PCR-amplified from the previously described cDNA clone (13Hovemann B.T. Ryseck R.-P. Walldorf U. Störtkuhl K.F. Dietzel I.D. Dessen E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) by using a 5′-KpnI primer 5′-GGTACC ATGGGTTCGCTGCCACAATTGTCG-3′ and a 3′-AgeI primer 5′-ACCGGT TTTGCCCACCTCCTTCCAATGGAC-3′. The product was cloned via KpnI and AgeI into the pMT-V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen), yielding pMT-ebony-HisA, which codes for the Ebony protein with a tag of six C-terminal histidines attached by a threonine-glycine bridge. A stable cell line was obtained by selection with hygromycin B according to the manufacturer's directions. EbonyHis-6 expression was induced by treatment with 0.5 mm CuSO4 for 24 h. Cells were lysed, and the protein was affinity-purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. EbonyHis-6 Production in E. coli BL21(pREP4-gsp)—Ebony cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned in the BamHI site of pQE60 (Qiagen). E. coli BL21(pREP4-gsp) cells were transformed with the construct. Expression was induced from cells in early log phase with 0.1–0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at 30 °C. The bacterial cell pellet was lysed in 50 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, with three rounds of French press treatment (1000 p.s.i.). From the cell lysate, Ebony was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose. Pooled enzyme fractions were dialyzed against 50 mm Na3PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Protein concentration was determined according to Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). ATP-pyrophosphate Exchange Assay—The ATP-pyrophosphate exchange assay was carried out according to Stachelhaus et al. (17Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) with modifications. In a final volume of 100 μl, the reaction mixture contained 500 nm affinity-purified enzyme, 1 mm amino acid, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm ATP, 50 μm tetra-sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.5 μCi (30 Ci/mmol) of tetra-[32P]sodium pyrophosphate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction was quenched by the addition of cold stop mixture containing 0.1 m sodium pyrophosphate, 0.56 m perchloric acid, and 1.2% (w/v) activated charcoal (Norit A, Sigma). The charcoal was pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with 1 ml of water, and resuspended in 0.5 ml of water. After addition of 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Rotiscint Eco Plus, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), the charcoal-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Thioester Formation (Loading Assay)—100 μl of reaction mixture contained 500 nm enzyme, 1 mm ATP, and 1–3 μCi of [3H]β-alanine (50 Ci/mmol) and 25 mm MgCl2 in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumen and 800 μl of chilled 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After 30 min on ice, the precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml of chilled 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was dissolved in 200 μl of formic acid. Incorporated radioactivity was counted in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. Peptide Bond Formation (Product Assay)—To ensure extensive loading of Ebony with its 3H-labeled cognate amino acid, a preincubation was carried out for 15 min under loading assay conditions. The condensation reaction was initiated by the addition of the respective amino group containing reaction partner in a final concentration of 1 mm. At time points 0 (before addition of the second substrate), 10 s, 30 s, 1 min, and 5 min, aliquots were taken for trichloroacetic acid precipitation and liquid scintillation counting as described above. Product Analysis—To obtain sufficient reaction product for mass spectroscopic analysis, the reaction mixture was scaled up 10-fold. 0.5 mm enzyme, 1 mm β-alanine, 1 mm biogenic amine, 25 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in a final volume of 1 ml were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. To analyze the products, the reaction was stopped by the addition of butanol/chloroform (4:1, v/v). After transfer to a fresh tube, the solvent was removed under vacuum. The pellet was resolved in 1 ml of methanol, and the samples were centrifuged for 15 min to pellet-insoluble components. Afterward the samples were directly injected into an electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight spectrometer (Qstar Pulsar I, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Evidence for a Thioesterification Step According to NRPSs—To investigate whether Ebony uses a NRPS-related activation process, Ser611 of Ebony, the counterpart of an invariant Ser in the thiolation domain of NRPSs, was mutated to Ala. If Ser611 holds the key function of P-pant cofactor binding, Ser611-Ala mutation should abolish Ebony activity completely as previously shown in mutational analysis of surfactin synthetase (18Vollenbroich D. Kluge B. D'Souza C. Zuber P. Vater J. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Dependence on functional activity of Ser611 versus Ala611 can easily be investigated in Drosophila in vivo by cuticle color of transgenic flies. Expression of a transgenic unmutated ebony-cDNA (e-cDNA) copy should suffice to restore wild type function in an ebony mutant background, whereas transgenic Ser611-Ala-mutated e-cDNA should have no effect. To perform this test, we generated two types of Drosophila transformant lines in w1118 ; In(3R)eAFA mutant background. An ebony-enhancer-gal4 construct was transformed to provide the Gal4-driving element at the sites of cuticular Ebony expression. In addition, transformant lines were generated that contained either a mutant or a wild type UAS-e-cDNA construct for Gal4-driven expression. In accordance with previous successful ebony rescue experiments, we selected a genomic DNA fragment as ebony-specific enhancer-driving element that starts with the upstream SalI site ∼5.6 kb upstream of the ebony transcriptional start and extends just into exon 2 (Fig. 3) (13Hovemann B.T. Ryseck R.-P. Walldorf U. Störtkuhl K.F. Dietzel I.D. Dessen E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ebony-specific cuticle activity of Gal4 in the respective transformant line was verified in a cross with a UAS-lacZ line. Faithful β-galactosidase activity as revealed by X-gal conversion to the blue dye 5-bromo-4-chloro indigo at sites of cuticular Ebony expression confirmed the tissue-specific driving capacity (Fig. 4A). To obtain Gal4-dependent Ebony expression, e-cDNA was PCR-amplified and cloned into pUAST using previously isolated cDNA clones (13Hovemann B.T. Ryseck R.-P. Walldorf U. Störtkuhl K.F. Dietzel I.D. Dessen E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A second pUAST-cDNA construct was prepared where a mutation in the ebony-reading frame was introduced by PCR amplification changing codon 611 from UCG (Ser) to GCG (Ala). Transformation into w1118 ; In(3R)eAFA flies resulted in lines harboring the wild type e-cDNA construct as well as in lines with the Ser611-Ala-mutated e-cDNA construct. Subsequently, the ebony enhancer-Gal4 line was crossed with these transformants to express the integrated e-cDNA-constructs. Before evaluating the functionality of the expressed Ebony proteins, we had to confirm that each of the transformed cDNA copies was faithfully translated. Immunochemical detection of Ebony was performed with an antiserum raised against the C-terminal portion of the protein (11Richardt A. Rybak J. Stortkuhl K.F. Meinertzhagen I.A. Hovemann B.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 452: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, protein preparations from fly heads of wild type Canton-S (lane 1), the recipient line w1118 ; In(3R)eAFA (lane 2) and the two cDNA-expressing lines, w1118 ; p[w, e-gal4]/p[w, UAS-e-cDNA] In(3R)eAFA (lane 3) and w1118 ; p[w, e-gal4]/p[w, UAS-e-cDNASer 611 -Ala]; In(3R)eAFA (lane 4), revealed that Ebony was clearly detectable in all but the w1118 ; In(3R)eAFA mutant recipient line (Fig. 4B, lane 2). After confirmation of Ebony protein expression, we monitored the competence for In(3R)eAFA mutant cuticle color rescue (Fig. 4C). Induction of wild type Ebony in an ebony-gal4/UAS-e-cDNA cross gave rise to a clear rescue of the mutant phenotype as revealed by reversion of the dark cuticle color in Fig. 4C, fly 3. Flies carrying the Ser611-Ala-mutated e-cDNA constructs showed a cuticle color identical to that of the ebony mutant parental line (Fig. 4C, fly 4). We note that the Ser611-Ala mutant Ebony protein was not competent in reverting the In(3R)e AFA mutant phenotype. Because the Ser611-Ala mutation is located within the conserved thiolation motif T (Fig. 3), this result is a strong hint to amino acid binding of Ebony by thioester formation. Expression of Active Ebony Requires P-pant Transfer—The aforementioned genetic evidence has to be confirmed by biochemical determination of Ebony activity. If Ebony indeed binds its amino acid substrate by the two-step process that is known from NRPSs, one has to assume the necessity of an enzyme activation step involving the transfer of a P-pant moiety to Ser611 (Fig. 2). To ensure production of activated Ebony holoenzyme, we had two options of expressing ebony cDNA. We used Schneider S2 cells (20Schneider I. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1972; 27: 353-365PubMed Google Scholar) anticipating that the homologous expression system might provide the necessary activation activity per se and in sufficient strength. Ebony-cDNA was cloned into pMT-V5-HisA, Schneider S2 cells were transformed with this construct, and a stably transformed cell line was selected. Cell lysis and subsequent affinity purification of the C-terminally His6-tagged protein resulted in a nearly pure protein according to SDS-PAGE. Even though assays on amino acid selection and activation as aminoacyladenylate revealed full activity for one amino acid (see below), loading onto the 4′-P-pant of Ebony was incomplete (Fig. 2). To find an explanation for the low level of activity, we first asked whether S2 cell-expressed Ebony was already substantially modified with the P-pant cofactor. The unspecific phosphopantetheinyltransferase from Bacillus subtilis, Sfp (21Quadri L.E. Weinreb P.H. Lei M. Nakano M.M. Zuber P. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar), was therefore used for additional in vitro conversion of potentially unphosphopantetheinylated S2 cell-expressed Ebony into the holoform. When [3H]coenzyme A (CoA) was added as substrate for Ebony phosphopantheteinylation, a significant amount of label was incorporated into Ebony (data not shown). This result indicated that [3H]P-pant had been transferred to Ebony by P-pant transferase activity in vitro. Both the thioesterification capacity and the P-pant acceptance of partially activated Ebony corroborated our genetic evidence. Amino Acid Activation and Binding by Ebony—To obtain highly activated enzyme in vivo, we transformed wild type and, as negative control, Ser611-Ala mutant ebony cDNA cloned in pQE60 (Qiagen) into E. coli BL21(pREP4-gsp). This strain coexpresses the unspecific phosphopantetheinyltransferase Gsp from Bacillus brevis (22Borchert S. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2458-2462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is frequently used to produce activated NRPSs by expression in E. coli. Assuming that Ebony mimics NRPS activity, amino acid activation and binding as thioester of affinity-purified His6-tagged protein was investigated separately. Activation experiments followed the established strategy in determining specificity of amino acid selection by ATP/PPi exchange (17Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Bergendahl V. Marahiel M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22773-22781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This assay, which monitors the reverse reaction of binding, the formation of [32P]ATP from aminoacyladenylate and [32P]PPi, was used to examine the forward reaction involving specific amino acid selection and activation as aminoacyladenylate. In all of the assays, the formation of [32P]ATP was determined after an incubation period of 15 min. As putative substrates, we tested the 20 proteinogenic l-amino acids in groups of three to six as well as β-alanine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), propylamine, and propionic acid as single substrates. Because this assay affirms only activation of the cognate amino acid as aminoacyladenylate independent of subsequent binding as thioester, it could be performed with all of the three enzyme preparations. The results obtained were identical with S2 cell-expressed, E. coli expressed wild type, and E. coli expressed Ser611-Ala mutant Ebony (data not shown), which confirms again that amino acid activation and thioesterification are independent processes. The presented experiments were performed using either E. coli expressed wild type or Ser611-Ala mutant Ebony protein. The highest amount of radioactivity incorporated into ATP was obtained when β-alanine was used as a substrate. The mean value from at least three separate measurements with several independent enzyme preparations was defined as 100% (Fig. 5). All of the proteinogenic l-amino acids that were used in combinations of 3–6 were below 2% of this value. Also, substances structurally related to β-alanine such as GABA, propylamine, and propionic acid did not serve as substrate for the adenylation process of Ebony. However, if β-alanine was added to one of the amino acid mixtures or to propylamine, [32P]ATP formation increased to above 90% (Fig. 5). Adenylation activity of Ser611-Ala mutant Ebony was indistinguishable from wild type enzyme (Fig. 5). Taken together, among all of the substances tested, only β-alanine was selected as substrate and was bound as aminoacyladenylate by Ebony. Substrate amino acid binding as thioester was next determined by incubation of E. coli produced wild type Ebony with [3H]β-alanine. Again, mean counts from at least three independent experiments were taken as 100% (Fig. 6A). Incubation with E. coli produced Ser611-Ala-mutated Ebony (data not shown) as well as the removal of ATP from the reaction mixture containing functional wild type Ebony (Fig. 6A) led to a 98% reduction. This result provides direct biochemical evidence that Ebony selects specifically the amino acid β-alanine, activates it as aminoacyladenylate, and binds it as thioester of the 4′-phosphopantetheinyl group linked to Ser611. Product Formation from β-Alanine-loaded Ebony—The reaction step of peptide bond formation and product release is reflected by the loss of radioactive counts from Ebony preloaded with [3H]β-alanine. This is caused by complete consumption of enzyme-bound [3H]β-alanine during the bond formation reaction. To identify compounds that are able to form a β-alanine conjugate, we incubated [3H]β-alanine-preloaded Ebony with various putative substrates (Fig. 6A). Dopamine gave rise to ∼94% reduction of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts, a result that indicates an almost complete conversion into product. We next examined whether additional substrates would be accepted. We first tested alternative bioactive compounds also containing a planar ring structure linked to an ethylamino or hydroxyethylamino group, the dopamine-related neurotransmitters tyramine and octopamine. Both compounds exhibited the same activity in the β-alanine release assay reducing trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity to ∼6% of the starting value (Fig. 6A). We next tried to find out whether changing the ring structure from a benzyl ring to an imidazole ring would reduce activity. Replacing dopamine by histamine, the reduction of precipitable counts to ∼5% was comparable with the previously employed substrates (Fig. 6A). Because there was no obvious difference in reactivity between a five- and a six-atom planar ring structure bound to an ethylamino group, we used the indol ring containing serotonin as substrate. Again, comparable activity leading to the release of 94% bound radioactivity was measured (Fig. 6A). The picture emerging by using physiologically active compounds was substantiated when biogenic amines were substituted by structurally related chemicals. Phenylethylamine and tryptamine could replace tyramine and serotonin, respectively, with the same efficiency of release of bound radioactivity. Also, the almost identical activity measured in the release assay when 2-(2-aminoethyl)-pyridine was used as substrate confirmed that the heterocyclic ring structure did not impair peptide bond-forming activity (Fig. 6A). However, when the amino group was placed close to the planar ring structure as in aniline for example, releasing activity was lost. We conclude from these results that a combination of an ethylamino or hydroxyethylamino group with a planar ring structure is sufficient to generate bond formation with β-alanine. We next investigated whether a primary amino group bound to an aliphatic chain would already allow β-alanine release. As shown in Fig. 6B, ethylamine had only little potential as substrate. With increasing length of the aliphatic chain as found in propylamine, butylamine, and pentylamine, a substantial portion of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts was released. Finally, we examined whether a negative charge contained in a putative substrate would impair release activity. When we used tyrosine and histidine to replace tyramine and histamine, respectively, β-alanine release was not observed (Fig. 6B). Obviously, the carboxyl group hindered these compounds from serving as active substrates. If sterical interference at the primary amino group would be the major cause for inhibition, the aliphatic ω-amino carbonic acids glycine, β-alanine, GABA, and 5-amino valerianic acid (Fig. 6B) should exhibit a growing release activity with increasing distance of the carboxyl function from the amino group. A comparison of the results obtained with pentylamine and 5-amino valerianic acid, however, shows that a carboxyl group even in ω position substantially slows down product formation. Taken together, the preferred structure for β-alanine release is clearly an ethylamino or hydroxyethylamino group linked to an uncharged hydrophobic backbone. Among the active compounds tested in these assays, only the biogenic amines histamine, dopamine, tyramine, octopamine, and serotonin can be considered to play a major role in Drosophila physiology. Release of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts from [3H]β-alanine-preloaded Ebony is an indirect measure of enzymatic activity but no direct proof of product formation. To ensure Ebony-catalyzed synthesis of the five predicted products β-alanyl-histamine, β-alanyl-dopamine, β-alanyl-tyramine, β-alanyl-octopamine, and β-alanyl-serotonin, we performed preparative product assays with β-alanine and the biogenic amines. These reactions were analyzed by high resolution mass spectroscopy. As a control, identical assays were performed and analyzed with the Ser611-Ala mutant replacing wild type Ebony. When using wild type Ebony, the mass signals of the expected products were detected, whereas the mass signals were absent when wild type Ebony was replaced by the Ser611-Ala mutant. These results are summarized in Table I.Table IProduct analysis using high resolution mass spectroscopy Ebony Contains an NRPS-like Amino Acid Activation Module—Ebony similar to NRPSs belongs to the large family of aminoacyladenylate-forming enzymes (23Turgay K. Krause M. Marahiel M.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2743-2744Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A relation to the thioesterification process, however, is in addition to NRPSs only present in the group of acyl carrier proteins including polyketide synthases and fatty acid synthases (24Stachelhaus T. Huser A. Marahiel M.A. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 913-921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 25Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 26Pfeifer E. Pavela-Vrancic M. von Dohren H. Kleinkauf H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7450-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The homology between polyketide and fatty acid synthases and Ebony is limited to the core sequence element of the thiolation domain, which contains the invariant serine, the P-pant cofactor-mediated acyl carrier. Acyl carrier proteins, NRPSs, and Ebony need to be activated by P-pant cofactor transfer, which requires a corresponding transferase activity. Searching for two conserved amino acid sequence motifs detected in previously sequenced P-pant transferases (25Lambalot R.H. Gehring A.M. Flugel R.S. Zuber P. LaCelle M. Marahiel M.A. Reid R. Khosla C. Walsh C.T. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 923-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), we indeed identified a reading frame in the Drosophila data base that showed a considerable homology to this conserved region. Expression of the corresponding putative P-pant transferase cDNA in E. coli gave rise to a protein that in vitro enhanced low level phosphantetheinylated S2 cell-derived Ebony activity depending on the presence of CoA comparable with the aforementioned Sfp. 2A. Richardt, unpublished results. Our results demonstrate that the higher eucaryote Drosophila has preserved an amino acid activation mechanism that until now was considered to be specific for microbial NRPSs (27Stein T. Vater J. Kruft V. Otto A. Wittmann-Liebold B. Franke P. Panico M. McDowell R. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15428-15435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Ebony combines this unique feature with a functional domain that allows peptide bond formation with a structurally constrained group of amines. However, a connection between two or more NRPS-like modules that enable the activation of amino acids and the formation of dipeptides has not yet been detected in higher eucaryotes even though genuine dipeptides such as β-alanyl-histidine (carnosine) have been shown to exist in vertebrates (28Flancbaum L. Brotman D.N. Fitzpatrick J.C. Van Es T. Kasziba E. Fisher H. Life Sci. 1990; 47: 1587-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Given the existence of a single NRPS-like activation domain in Ebony, nonribosomal synthesis of dipeptides in higher eucaryotes cannot generally be excluded. However, it would require two amino acid activation modules in addition to a functional domain for condensation of the two activated amino acids as well as a thioesterase activity for peptide release (29Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Evidence that this complex structure of multimodular NRPS activity has been preserved through evolution to higher eucaryotes is still lacking. Our experimental data now show that Ebony uses a novel two-step reaction mechanism including amino acid activation and binding followed by peptide bond formation. The procedure of amino acid activation and binding resembles that of NRPSs. Peptide bond formation and product release require a nucleophilic attack of an incoming primary amine that must meet the observed structural prerequisites. This is different in multimodular NRPSs in two ways. 1) The nature of peptide bond forming amino acid is predetermined by the specificity of a second adenylation domain within the multimodular enzyme, and 2) in NRPSs, a condensation domain located between the modules is essential for peptide bond catalysis. Such a condensation domain is missing in Ebony. Instead, a C-terminal domain (Fig. 2) with a yet unknown function seems to be responsible for catalyzing the nucleophilic attack of the primary amines (with relaxed substrate specificity) on the activated carboxyl thioester group of β-alanine. The mechanism of this reaction and that of dipeptide product release are still unknown. Putative Ebony Function in Neurotransmitter Metabolism— Ebony is expressed in diverse tissues at different times during development (11Richardt A. Rybak J. Stortkuhl K.F. Meinertzhagen I.A. Hovemann B.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 452: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Nervous system activity has been predicted from the behavioral and visual phenotype of the mutant but was only recently confirmed by activity staining of an ebony-lacZ fusion gene transformant and by immunocytochemistry (11Richardt A. Rybak J. Stortkuhl K.F. Meinertzhagen I.A. Hovemann B.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 452: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 13Hovemann B.T. Ryseck R.-P. Walldorf U. Störtkuhl K.F. Dietzel I.D. Dessen E. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 221: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The puzzling fact that evidence for dopaminergic neurons in the lamina was lacking (30Nassel D.R. Elekes K. Johansson K.U. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 1988; 1: 311-325PubMed Google Scholar) led to experiments that revealed that Ebony is involved in β-alanyl-histamine formation in the eye (12Borycz J. Borycz J.A. Loubani M. Meinertzhagen I.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10549-10557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of capturing the biogenic amines histamine, dopamine, tyramine, octopamine, and serotonin that clearly fulfill different functions in Drosophila to β-alanine might reflect a key function of Ebony at specific sites of the body (6Wright T.R.F. Scandalios J.G. Caspari E.W. Advances in Genetics. Vol. 24. Academic Press, Inc., San, Diego1987: 127-209Google Scholar, 11Richardt A. Rybak J. Stortkuhl K.F. Meinertzhagen I.A. Hovemann B.T. J. Comp. Neurol. 2002; 452: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Here we provide evidence that Ebony is indeed capable of binding biogenic amines including histamine to β-alanine. Therefore, it is plausible to assign to Ebony a function in histamine neurotransmitter metabolism at the photoreceptor synapse of the eye. Because histamine synthesis (31Morgan J.R. Gebhardt K.A. Stuart A.E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1217-1225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as metabolic degradation (10Sarthy P.V. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1757-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) in the eye is relatively slow, the almost infinite transmitter supply must be maintained by a fast re-uptake system (32Melzig J. Burg M. Gruhn M. Pak W.L. Buchner E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7160-7166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Stuart A.E. Morgan J.R. Mekeel H.E. Kempter E. Callaway J.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3178-3188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, at the synapse where transmitter removal excites the postsynaptic cell by disinhibition, a mechanism of fast retraction of histamine from the synaptic cleft is essential. Interestingly, in illuminated barnacle photoreceptor preparations, [3H]histamine was concentrated over the photoreceptor terminals, whereas after incubation in the dark, the label was found at the glia (33Stuart A.E. Morgan J.R. Mekeel H.E. Kempter E. Callaway J.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3178-3188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation lends support to the concept that at darkening a fast clearance of transmitter out of the synaptic cleft would be achieved by transport of histamine into the surrounding glia where it could be trapped by Ebony via β-alanine binding. The model requires that β-alanine is sufficiently loaded in the glia to prime Ebony for histamine capture and a biochemical pathway that allows the subsequent reuse of the withdrawn histamine in the photoreceptor. Although both histamine transport into photoreceptor as well as into glia has been reported previously (32Melzig J. Burg M. Gruhn M. Pak W.L. Buchner E. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7160-7166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Stuart A.E. Morgan J.R. Mekeel H.E. Kempter E. Callaway J.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 3178-3188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be investigated whether a mechanism exists that darkening and concomitant reduction of histamine release shifts uptake toward glia followed by immediate inactivation by β-alanine binding. Fast histamine removal from the synaptic cleft is essential for the function of arthropod photoreceptor synapses that operate with tonic release of histamine. In vitro product formation from [3H]β-alanine-loaded Ebony with histamine or any of the other biogenic amine substrates was already completed within 10 s, the shortest time point that could be determined under standard assay conditions. 2A. Richardt, unpublished results. This time point is still far away from the reaction velocity expected for a function in neurotransmitter inactivation. Beyond this point, reaction velocity may differ among the biogenic amines serving as substrate. Determination of V max and Km values of individual biogenic amines requires specific analytical methods operating in the millisecond range. They will disclose whether Ebony can fulfill the kinetic prerequisites for neurotransmitter inactivation. We thank K. Störtkuhl, I. D. Dietzel and I. Sures for critical reading of the paper. We thank also Uwe Linne for carrying out the mass detection analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2093755587,"Unique among the phospholipase C isozymes, the recently identified phospholipase C-ϵ (PLC-ϵ) contains an amino-terminal CDC25 domain capable of catalyzing nucleotide exchange on Ras family GTPases as well as a tandem array of Ras-associating (RA) domains near its carboxyl terminus that are effector binding sites for activated H-Ras and Rap. To determine whether other small GTPases activate PLC-ϵ, we measured inositol phosphate accumulation in COS-7 cells expressing a broad range of GTPase-deficient mutants of Ras superfamily proteins. RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC all markedly stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation in PLC-ϵ-expressing cells. This stimulation matched or exceeded phospholipase activation promoted by co-expression of PLC-ϵ with the known regulators Ras, Gα12/13, or Gβ1γ2. In contrast, little effect was observed with the other Rho family members Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, and Cdc42. Truncation of the two carboxyl-terminal RA domains caused loss of responsiveness to H-Ras but not to Rho. Truncation of PLC-ϵ to remove the CDC25 and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains also did not cause loss of responsiveness to Rho, Gα12/13, or Gβ1γ2. Comparative sequence analysis of mammalian phospholipase C isozymes revealed a unique ∼65 amino acid insert within the catalytic core of PLC-ϵ not present in PLC-β, γ, δ, or ζ. A PLC-ϵ construct lacking this region was no longer activated by Rho or Gα12/13 but retained regulation by Gβγ and H-Ras. GTP-dependent interaction of Rho with PLC-ϵ was illustrated in pull-down experiments with GST-Rho, and this interaction was retained in the PLC-ϵ construct lacking the unique insert within the catalytic core. These results are consistent with the conclusion that Rho family GTPases directly interact with PLC-ϵ by a mechanism independent of the CDC25 or RA domains. A unique insert within the catalytic core of PLC-ϵ imparts responsiveness to Rho, which may signal downstream of Gα12/13 in the regulation of PLC-ϵ, because activation by both Rho and Gα12/13 is lost in the absence of this sequence.

This ∼250 kDa isozyme contains the structural core (EF-hands, catalytic TIM barrel, and C2 domain) common to all PLC isozymes as well as additional domains at the amino and carboxyl termini that implicate interactions with Ras family GTPases. More specifically, a CDC25 domain at the amino terminus of PLC-ϵ functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for H-Ras and/or Rap1 (16Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y.

The goals of this study were to determine whether additional members of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases regulate the phospholipase activity of PLC-ϵ and to delimit the domains of PLC-ϵ necessary for activation by Gα12/13, Gβγ, and Ras family GTPases. Our analyses have revealed novel regulation of PLC-ϵ by Rho family GTPases through a mechanism not involving the previously identified CDC25 and RA domains of the isozyme. Instead, we have identified an insertion within the Y region of PLC-ϵ not present in other PLC isozymes that is essential for Rho and Gα12/13 activation of PLC-ϵ. In vitro binding experiments illustrate a GTP-dependent and a Y box insert-independent interaction of RhoA with PLC-ϵ. Materials—The open reading frame of rat PLC-ϵ in pCMV-script (kind gift of Grant Kelley, State University of New York, Syracuse, NY) was subcloned into pCMV-Myc resulting in an amino-terminal Myc-tagged rPLC-ϵ. pcDNA3 expression vectors for untagged Gα12 and Gα13 (21Zohn I.E.

Hemagglutinin A-tagged wild type and GTPase deficient mutants of Rho family GTPases were obtained from the Guthrie Institute (Sayre, PA). A rabbit PLC-ϵ antibody was generated by BioSource against a predicted exposed sequence, LKAHQTPVDILKQKAHQL, immediately carboxyl-terminal to the X box. Computational Tools—Vector NTI (Informax Inc.) and NCBI Psi-Blast (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) were utilized to identify the unique insert in the Y box (TIM barrel) of PLC-ϵ. Multiple sequence alignments were made with the AlignX module of Vector NTI, which employs a ClustalW alignment tool. Transfection of COS-7 Cells and Quantitation of Phospholipase C Activity—COS-7 cells were seeded in 12-well culture dishes at a density of ∼60,000 cells per well and maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 90% air/10% CO2. The indicated DNA vectors were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) transfection reagent (3 μl of FuGENE per1 μg of DNA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total DNA varied from 400 to 800 ng per well and included empty vector as necessary to maintain an equal amount of DNA per well within individual experiments. Approximately twenty-four hours after transfection, culture medium was changed to inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (ICN Biomedicals) containing 1 μCi/well myo-[2-3H(N)]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), and metabolic labeling was allowed to proceed for 12–16 h. Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was quantitated subsequent to the addition of 10 mm LiCl to inhibit inositol monophosphate phosphatases. The reaction was stopped after 60 min by aspiration of the medium and the addition of 50 mm formic acid followed by neutralization with 150 mm NH4OH. [3H]Inositol phosphates were quantified by Dowex chromatography as described previously (23Brown H.A. Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 648-655PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of PLC-ϵ Fragments—PLC-ϵ fragments were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the selected region from full-length rPLC-ϵ cDNA following standard protocols and were ligated in-frame into pCMV-Myc (Clontech). Constructs were verified by sequencing, and the expression of all constructs in COS-7 cells was confirmed by Western blots with c-Myc antibody (Invitrogen). Specific constructs and corresponding amino acid ranges (see Fig 2A) include the following: CDC25-C2, 509–1987; CDC25-RA1, 509–2113; CDC25-Cterm, 509–2281; EF-Cterm, 1198–2281; and EF-CtermΔY, 1198–2281 lacking residues 1667–1728). GST-Rho Pull-down Assays—The coding sequences for human Ras, Rac1, and RhoA were amplified by PCR and subcloned into linear pGEX4T2 (Amersham Biosciences) in-frame with the GST coding sequence. BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with individual GST-GTPase plasmids, grown to mid-log phase, and protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 8 h at 27 °C. Cells were harvested, resuspended in PBS, lysed with an Emulsi-Flex C5 (Avestin), and clarified supernatant was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose. GST-GTPases were eluted after several wash steps with 10 mm glutathione, and the resulting recombinant protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. Purified GTPases were loaded with either GDP or GTPγS by a 30-min incubation at room temperature in the presence of 2 mm EDTA and either 200 μm GDP or GTPγS followed by the addition of 10 mm MgCl2. Loaded GTPases were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed twice with PBS containing 5 mm MgCl2. The concentrations of GTPases were determined after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, and all pull-downs were carried out with equivalent amounts of each GTPase. COS-7 cells were seeded at 3 × 106 cells per 150-mm dish and transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) ∼8 h later with the indicated DNAs. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were rinsed twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1.5 ml lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm MgCl2, containing protease inhibitors). COS-7 cell lysates were rocked for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Two hundred microliters of each supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C with ∼8 μg GDP- or GTPγS-loaded GST-RhoA, GST-Rac1, or GST-H-Ras. Glutathione-Sepharose resin was washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with PBS containing 5 mm MgCl2, resuspended in 25 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. Western blotting was performed using anti-Myc (Invitrogen) and anti-PLC-β2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies. Ten microliters of each COS-7 cell lysate was used to confirm the expression of transfected DNA. Activation of PLC-ϵ by the Small GTPase Rho—Previous studies illustrated that H-Ras and Rap isozymes interact with the Ras-associating domains of PLC-ϵ to stimulate phospholipase activity (16Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Shibatohge M. Wu D. Satoh T. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To determine whether other small GTPases also activate PLC-ϵ, COS-7 cells were transfected with DNA vectors encoding PLC-ϵ and various small GTPases of the Rho family prior to measuring the total inositol phosphate accumulation indicative of PLC-ϵ activity (Fig. 1). As observed previously, transfection of PLC-ϵ alone resulted in a small increase in [3H]inositol phosphates that was substantially augmented by cotransfection with Gβ1γ2 or GTPase-deficient mutants of Gα12, Gα13, or H-Ras (Fig 1A). Surprisingly, constitutively active forms of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC also markedly stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation after cotransfection with PLC-ϵ (Fig 1B, and data not shown). In fact, the constitutively active Rho isoforms consistently produced higher inositol phosphate accumulation relative to the known activators of PLC-ϵ. In contrast, constitutively active Rac1, Rac2, Rac3, or Cdc42 had little or no effect on inositol phosphate formation catalyzed by cotransfected PLC-ϵ (Fig 1B, and data not shown). Enhanced phospholipase C activity was dependent on PLC-ϵ, because transfection of the Rho isozymes alone did not cause marked increases in inositol phosphate accumulation (Fig 1C). Furthermore, whereas wild-type versions of the Rho isozymes augmented the phospholipase activity of PLC-ϵ, this activation was routinely enhanced with constitutively active mutants of the GTPases (Fig 1C) consistent with the possibility that PLC-ϵ is a direct, downstream effector of Rho. Western blots indicated approximately equivalent levels of expression of each small GTPase under the conditions of these assays (Fig 1C, insets), and no changes in the levels of expression of PLC-ϵ occurred as a consequence of coexpression with the various GTPases (data not shown). Definition of Regions of PLC-ϵ Essential for Activation by Rho, Gα 12/13, and Gβγ—Interaction of PLC-ϵ with H-Ras is dependent on the presence of the second Ras-associating domain of PLC-ϵ, and disruption of this interaction by mutation of lysine 2150 to glutamate in rat PLC-ϵ prevents the phospholipase-stimulating activity of H-Ras (18Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). To assess the role of the RA domains in the regulation of PLC-ϵ by other activators, COS-7 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding either Rho, Gα12/13, or Gβ1γ2 and one of a series of PLC-ϵ fragments (Fig 2A). Although deletion of either the last (CDC25-RA1) or both of the RA domains (CDC25-C2) from an amino-terminally truncated form of PLC-ϵ (CDC25-Cterm) eliminated activation by GTPase-deficient H-Ras, the marked stimulation of phospholipase C by constitutively active Rho (as well as by Gα12/13 or Gβ1γ2; data not shown) was essentially unaffected (Fig 2B). Therefore, the RA domains of the isozyme are necessary for activation by H-Ras but not by other activators, including those of the Rho family of small GTPases. Results from our previous study indicated that activation of PLC-ϵ by Gβγ was independent of either H-Ras or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), and a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain was identified in PLC-ϵ as a potential site of interaction with Gβγ (20Wing M.R. Houston D. Kelley G.G. Der C.J. Siderovski D.P. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48257-48261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To test whether the PH domain of PLC-ϵ is essential for activation by Gβ1γ2, Gα12/13, or Rho, these proteins were co-expressed with an amino-terminally truncated fragment of PLC-ϵ lacking the PH domain (EF-Cterm) and encoding sequence from the EF-hands of PLC-ϵ to its carboxyl terminus. Surprisingly, Gβ1γ2, as well as Gα12/13, RhoA, RhoB, and H-Ras all activated this fragment of PLC-ϵ, indicating that the CDC25 and PH domains are not essential for PLC-ϵ activation by any of these G proteins (Fig 2C). Thus, in combination with the previous results that eliminated the RA domains as important determinants for PLC-ϵ activation by Rho, Gα12/13, or Gβγ, these modulators require only the core catalytic domain of PLC-ϵ (EF-hands to C2 domain) to enhance phospholipase activity. Identification of an Insertion in the Y Box of PLC-ϵ —As illustrated in the experiments above, PLC-ϵ is unique among PLC isozymes in requiring only the catalytic core for activation by Rho, Gα12, and Gα13. To identify unique regions within the catalytic core of PLC-ϵ that potentially could impart this responsiveness, pair-wise and multiple sequence alignments were performed comparing PLC-ϵ isoforms with the other classes of PLC. This analysis revealed a previously unidentified ∼65 residue insertion (residues 1669–1730 in PLC-ϵ) within the Y box of all forms of PLC-ϵ, including the distantly related PLC-ϵ from Caenorhabditis elegans, that is not present in other PLC isozymes (Fig 3A). Examination of the PLC-δ structure indicates that this insert maps to a small surface-exposed loop within the catalytic core distinct from the highly disordered and poorly conserved X-Y linker characteristic of all PLC isozymes (Fig 3B). The unique placement of this insertion within PLC-ϵ suggests that it would be available to interact with other proteins that specifically regulate PLC-ϵ compared with other PLC isozymes. Given the clear demarcation of this insertion between regions of high sequence conservation corresponding to known secondary structure elements within PLC-δ1, we anticipated that deletion of this region would not destroy proper folding of PLC-ϵ. As such, the unique insert was deleted from the amino-terminally truncated form of PLC-ϵ (EF-Cterm), and the resultant protein, EF-CtermΔY, was shown to retain phospholipase C activity when over-expressed in COS-7 cells (Fig 4A). Furthermore, EF-CtermΔY retained capacity for activation by H-Ras and Gβ1γ2 (Fig 4A). In marked contrast, EF-CtermΔY was completely unresponsive to stimulation of phospholipase activity by either Gα12/13 or Rho (Fig 4A), directly implicating this unique ∼65 amino acids insertion in the regulation of PLC-ϵ by both Gα12/13 and Rho. This differential responsiveness was further illustrated in an experiment in which amounts of transfected DNA were varied over several orders of magnitude, and phospholipase stimulation was normalized to account for differences in intrinsic activity of the phospholipase variants (Fig 4B). Constitutively active RhoA elevated the phospholipase activity of EF-Cterm by >10-fold, whereas the mutant form of PLC-ϵ lacking the insertion was essentially unresponsive to the GTPase mutant of RhoA over a broad range of amounts of transfected DNA. Again, H-Ras activation of PLC-ϵ was independent of the Y-box insertion irrespective of the amount of H-Ras DNA that was transfected.Fig. 4Rho and Gα12/13 do not activate PLC-ϵ lacking the unique insertion within the Y box. A, COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated GTPase-deficient G protein subunits (maximally activating amounts as in Fig. 1, A and B) in the absence of exogenous PLC or the presence of either amino-terminally truncated PLC-ϵ, (EF-Cterm, 300 ng) or the identical construct with the Y box insert deleted (EF-CtermΔY, 300 ng). Total inositol phosphate accumulation was quantified, and values in the absence of exogenous PLC were subtracted from the corresponding values in the presence of PLC-ϵ fragments. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with varying amounts of DNA encoding constitutively active RhoA or H-Ras and either EF-Cterm or EF-CtermΔY (300 ng), and inositol phosphate accumulation was quantified. To account for the difference in basal activity of the PLC-ϵ fragments observed in panel A, values were normalized to represent the fold increase in inositol phosphate accumulation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GTP-dependent Interaction of Rho with PLC-ϵ —To determine whether PLC-ϵ interacts directly with Rho and whether the Y box insert is uniquely responsible for this interaction, COS-7 cells were transfected with DNA encoding one of the following: Myc-EF-Cterm; Myc-EF-Cterm ΔY; Myc-Rho kinase (ROCK); or PLC-β2 (Fig. 5). Cell lysates obtained after 24 h of culture under each condition were incubated with GST-RhoA, GST-Rac1, or GST-H-Ras, each prepared in either the GDP- or GTPγS-bound form. Both PLC-ϵ EF-Cterm and EF-Cterm ΔY precipitated with GST-RhoA and GST-H-Ras in the GTPγS-bound but not the GDP-bound form. In contrast, no interaction was observed between the PLC-ϵ isozymes and GST-Rac1 in either the GDP- or GTPγS-bound state. As expected, Rac1, which activates PLC-β2 (24Illenberger D. Schwald F.

Taken together, these results illustrate interaction of PLC-ϵ with RhoA and suggest that, although the unique Y box insert is required for Rho activation of PLC-ϵ, it does not solely account for Rho interaction. The recent identification of PLC-ϵ as a Ras- and Gα12/13-activated enzyme that also exhibits Ras GEF activity has added complexity to inositol lipid signaling. PLC-γ was previously thought to underlie inositol phosphate signaling in response to tyrosine kinase receptors, and, likewise, G proteincoupled, receptor-stimulated inositol phosphate production was thought to occur through PLC-β isozymes and Gαq or Gβγ. Activation of PLC-ϵ by Gα12/13, Gβγ, and Ras reveals a convergence of tyrosine kinase/Ras GTPase and heterotrimeric G protein signaling through a common effector. Results reported here illustrate that Rho family GTPases regulate PLC-ϵ and do so through a unique region, further amplifying the complexity of regulation both of PLC-ϵ and of inositol lipid signaling in general. The initial identification of the rat and human PLC-ϵ genes revealed the presence of tandem RA domains at the carboxyl terminus (16Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M. Kariyai K. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y.

GTP-dependent binding of H-Ras with the second RA domain was directly confirmed and shown to be essential for Ras stimulation of phospholipase activity of PLC-ϵ (16Song C. Hu C.D. Masago M.

Whether increased lipase activity is due to direct activation of PLC-ϵ or translocation of the enzyme to the membrane, as is the case with other Ras effectors, remains unclear. The current data indicate that, in addition to Ras, the Rho family GTPases Rho A, B, and C, but not the highly homologous Rac1, 2, 3, or Cdc42, activate PLC-ϵ. Indeed, the extent of activation observed with the Rho GTPases was consistently greater than that observed with H-Ras. Moreover, truncation/deletion analyses revealed that Rho-dependent activation of PLC-ϵ is independent of the CDC25, PH, and RA domains, which distinctly contrasts with the requirement of an intact RA2 domain for Ras activation of PLC-ϵ. Lomasney and co-workers reported that PLC-ϵ is not simply a Ras effector but also acts as a Ras activator, suggesting an intriguing positive feedback loop (17Lopez I. Mak E.C. Ding J. Hamm H.E. Lomasney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with PLC-ϵ activating Ras via the GEF activity of a CDC25 domain in the amino terminus. However, Kataoka and co-workers, working with a different amino-terminal splice variant of human PLC-ϵ, have suggested that the GEF domain is selective for Rap over Ras (19Jin T.G. Satoh T. Liao Y.

Gao X. Kataoka T. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8105-8113Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although the CDC25 domain of PLC-ϵ could yet prove to interact with Rho GTPases as downstream signaling molecules, this domain clearly is not involved in the activating effects observed with Rho GTPases in our study. Previous studies have illustrated that Ras and Gα12/13 subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins activate PLC-ϵ through separate mechanisms (17Lopez I. Mak E.C. Ding J. Hamm H.E. Lomasney J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2758-2765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Kelley G.G. Reks S.E. Ondrako J.M. Smrcka A.V.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48257-48261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the regions of the enzyme essential for Gα12/13 regulation have remained undefined. We illustrate here that the amino terminus, CDC25 domain, PH domain, and RA domains are not necessary for Gα12/13 regulation of PLC-ϵ. Identification of a unique sequence within the Y domain of PLC-ϵ suggested that this region might be responsible for Rho, Gα12/13, and/or Gβγ activation of the isozyme. This sequence is predicted to be an exposed region on the surface of the enzyme based on the crystal structure of PLC-δ. The functional importance of this sequence is supported by our observations that its removal eliminated Rho- and Gα12/13-(but not Ras- or Gβγ-) promoted activation of PLC-ϵ. GTP-dependent interaction of Rho with PLC-ϵ was illustrated in pull-down experiments with GST-Rho. Whereas the unique sequence in the Y domain of PLC-ϵ was necessary to observe Rho-dependent stimulation of phospholipase C activity, binding of GTP-activated Rho was retained in a mutant PLC-ϵ lacking the insert. This sequence may constitute part, but not all of a binding site, in essence being necessary, but not sufficient, to bind G protein alone. Therefore, the structural basis for the interaction of Rho with PLC-ϵ and its concomitant activation remain to be defined. In a previous study, we identified a PH domain and EF-hand region in PLC-ϵ and illustrated that Gβγ subunits stimulate phospholipase activity of PLC-ϵ (20Wing M.R. Houston D. Kelley G.G. Der C.J.

The experiments reported here illustrate that the PH domain is not necessary for Gβγ activation of PLC-ϵ when expressed in COS-7 cells. Indeed, mutant PLC-ϵ fragments missing the amino-terminal region, CDC25 domain, and PH domain apparently retained full regulation by Gβγ, and the region of Gβγ regulation of PLC-ϵ was delimited to the catalytic core of the enzyme (EF-hand, X, Y, and C2 domains). An α-helix within the Y box of PLC-β2 appears to mediate its interaction with Gβγ (32Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A similar region may be involved in Gβγ regulation of PLC-ϵ, although the Tyr-578 residue reported to be essential for Gβγ activation of PLC-β2 is not present in PLC-ϵ. The addition of Rho to the known regulators of PLC-ϵ introduces a previously unsuspected signaling pathway into an effector that generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. As such, PLC-ϵ is implicated as a potential effector in Rho-dependent processes, including cytoskeletal rearrangement, vascular smooth muscle contraction, gene expression, and cell growth. Many of these processes are regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (i.e. for thrombin, lysophosphatidic acid, endothelin, etc.), perhaps via the Gα12 family of G proteins (33Seasholtz T.M. Majumdar M. Brown J.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 949-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The recent identification of Rho GEFs that are activated by Gα12/13 (i.e. p115RhoGEF and LARG) bridges the gap between heterotrimeric and Rho GTPases (34Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M.

Because both Gα12/13 and Rho activation of PLC-ϵ are dependent on a relatively short sequence within the Y box, we speculate, although we have no direct evidence, that Rho mediates the Gα12/13 activation of PLC-ϵ.

Results from numerous studies have revealed important differences between TIMP family members in their ability to inhibit angiogenic processes in vitro and angiogenesis in vivo despite their universal ability to inhibit matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. To address these differences, a series of structure-function studies were conducted to identify and to characterize the anti-angiogenic domains of TIMP-2, the endogenous MMP inhibitor that uniquely inhibits capillary endothelial cell (EC) proliferation as well as angiogenesis in vivo. We demonstrate that the COOH-terminal domain of TIMP-2 (T2C) inhibits the proliferation of capillary EC at molar concentrations comparable with those previously reported for intact TIMP-2, while the NH2-terminal domain (T2N), which inhibits MMP activity, has no significant anti-proliferative effect. Interestingly, although both T2N and T2C inhibited embryonic angiogenesis, only T2C resulted in the potent inhibition of angiogenesis driven by the exogenous addition of angiogenic mitogen, suggesting that MMP inhibition alone may not be sufficient to inhibit the aggressive neovascularization characteristic of aberrant angiogenesis. We further mapped the anti-proliferative activity of T2C to a 24-amino acid peptide corresponding to Loop 6 of TIMP-2 and show that Loop 6 is a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and mitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo. These findings demonstrate that TIMP-2 possesses two distinct types of anti-angiogenic activities which can be uncoupled from each other, the first represented by its MMP-dependent inhibitory activity which can inhibit only embryonic neovascularization and the second represented by an MMP-independent activity which inhibits both normal angiogenesis and mitogen-driven angiogenesis in vivo. In addition, we report, for the first time, the discovery of Loop 6 as a novel and potent inhibitor of angiogenesis.

Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar). Among these is angiogenesis, the formation of new capillaries from the pre-existing vasculature. Regulation of MMP activity is achieved at the transcriptional level (1Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar) as well as by a family of endogenous inhibitors, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Shifts in the proteolytic balance in favor of MMP activity have been shown to play a crucial role in regulating angiogenesis as well as tumor growth and metastasis (2Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R.

Historically, the potential therapeutic value of endogenous, as well as of synthetic inhibitors of metalloproteinases, has been predicated on their ability to inhibit MMP activity. More recently, attention has been focused on the ability of TIMPs to regulate angiogenesis. Since it was first demonstrated that TIMPs could inhibit angiogenesis, numerous studies have sought to characterize the specific angiogenic processes effected by MMP inhibitors (2Moses M.A. Sudhalter J.

Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). It is now widely appreciated that although all three TIMPs (TIMP-1, -2, and -3) tested to date inhibit MMP activity and the migration of endothelial cells stimulated by angiogenic mitogens, these inhibitors differ in their ability to regulate other angiogenic processes (4Moses M.A. Stem Cells. 1997; 15: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 11Murphy A.N.

Zetter B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). For example, TIMP-2 has the ability to inhibit the proliferation of capillary endothelial cells driven by angiogenic mitogens, while TIMP-1 has been reported to be a modest stimulator of capillary EC growth (11Murphy A.N. Unsworth E.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Cell Physiol. 1993; 157: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 14Hayakawa T. Yamashita K. Tanzawa K. Uchijima E. Iwata K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Although TIMP-3 has recently been reported to inhibit the proliferation of genetically modified aortic endothelial cells that overexpress the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR (15Qi J.H. Ebrahem Q. Moore N. Murphy G. Claesson-Welsh L. Bond M. Baker A. Anand-Apte B. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), previous studies have reported that TIMP-3 actually had no effect on capillary endothelial cell proliferation (13Anand-Apte B. Pepper M.S. Voest E. Montesano R. Olsen B. Murphy G. Apte S.S. Zetter B. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: 817-823PubMed Google Scholar). TIMP-4, the latest member of the TIMP family to be cloned, has yet to be rigorously tested. Moreover, neither Batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic MMP inhibitor with potent MMP-inhibitory activity, nor immunoneutralizing antibodies to MMP-2, inhibit capillary EC proliferation (11Murphy A.N. Unsworth E.J. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Cell Physiol. 1993; 157: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In fact, Batimastat has been shown to stimulate the outgrowth of capillary vessels, another process required for successful angiogenesis (16Koolwijk P. Sidenius N. Peters E. Sier C.F. Hanemaaijer R. Blasi F. van Hinsbergh V.W. Blood. 2001; 97: 3123-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the pleiotropic effects that MMP inhibitors have on specific angiogenic processes, such as the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation by TIMP-2, may be independent of their metalloproteinase inhibitory activity. The goal of the current study was to identify and characterize the structural domains of TIMP-2 responsible for its endothelial cell growth-modulating activity and its anti-angiogenic activity in vivo. Previous reports have shown that the NH2-terminal domain of TIMPs house the MMP inhibitory activity and that the amino acid sequence of this inhibitory site is highly conserved throughout the TIMP family (17Murphy G.

We therefore hypothesized that the unique anti-proliferative activity of TIMP-2 would be located in the more variable COOH-terminal domain (Fig. 1A). To test this hypothesis, we have conducted a series of structure-function studies to identify the structural determinants of the anti-angiogenic activity of TIMP-2. We have independently expressed and purified both the NH2-terminal (T2N) and the COOH-terminal (T2C) domains of TIMP-2 as defined by the biochemical and three-dimensional structural information available (17Murphy G.

In this report, we demonstrate, for the first time, that TIMP-2 possesses two distinct anti-angiogenic activities which can be dissociated from each other, both in terms of their structure and their angiogenesis-modulating activities in vivo. The NH2-terminal domain, T2N, which inhibits MMP activity but not capillary EC growth, suppresses embryonic neovascularization in vivo but not the neovascularization driven by an angiogenic mitogen. These results suggest that inhibition of MMP activity alone may not be sufficient to inhibit the mitogen-stimulated neovascularization that is characteristic of pathologic angiogenesis. In contrast, the COOH-terminal domain of TIMP-2, T2C, which is deficient in MMP-inhibitory activity but which inhibits capillary EC proliferation, is a potent inhibitor of both embryonic and mitogen-stimulated angiogenesis in vivo. Further structural mapping of this activity using synthetic peptides demonstrates that the anti-angiogenic activity of T2C can be found in Loop 6. In summary, we have uncoupled the MMP-dependent and MMP-independent angiogenesis-modulating activities of TIMP-2, and in doing so, have identified a novel, potent, small molecular weight inhibitor of angiogenesis. Cloning and Expression of hTIMP-2 and hTIMP-2 Domains—Human TIMP-2 was cloned via PCR of a human fetal heart cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using primers specific for the mature form of TIMP-2. Two separate TIMP-2 domains were produced using PCR primers designed to yield two fragments of TIMP-2 which encode for either the three NH2-terminal loops (Cys1–Glu127), designated T2N, or the three COOH-terminal loops (Cys128–Pro194), designated T2C. A fourth construct, designated EA-T2N, was designed to produce an inactive mutant of T2N using PCR to add two amino acid residues, glutamic acid and alanine, to the NH2 terminus of T2N. The full-length TIMP-2 PCR product, as well as the two TIMP-2 fragments and the mutant EA-T2N, were subcloned into the yeast expression vector pPICZαA (Invitrogen) and their sequences verified. COOH-terminal His tags were designed into each of the constructs to aid in the purification of expressed proteins. Linearized vectors were electroporated into the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris for expression (Invitrogen), and integrants were selected by culturing on YPDS (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose, 1 m sorbitol, 2% agar) plates with 100 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) for 3 days. Successful insertion of the genes of interest into the Pichia genome was verified by PCR using Pichia-specific primers, which also verified that recombination occurred at the proper site such that expression of the gene of interest is under the control of the methanol-inducible AOX1 promoter. Four Pichia clones for each gene of interest were tested for expression levels, and the clone expressing the highest amount of each protein was chosen for subsequent studies. Expression conditions were as follows: 25-ml overnight cultures were grown at 30 °C in BMGY medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 100 mm potassium phosphate pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogenous base, 1% glucose) containing 100 μg/ml zeocin, and cell pellets were collected the next day by centrifugation at 1500 × g. Cultures were induced by resuspending the cell pellets in 250 ml of methanol-containing medium (BMMY: 2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.0, 1.34% yeast nitrogenous base, 1% methanol), and allowed to grow for 24 h. Medium containing the secreted expressed protein was cleared of cell content by centrifugation at 3000 × g. Purification of Recombinant TIMP-2 and TIMP-2 Domains—Expressed proteins were initially purified from the yeast media using histidine affinity binding to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) under native conditions. Briefly, expressed protein in 250 ml of cleared medium was allowed to bind to 5 ml of resin by nutating for 1 h at 4 °C and then centrifuged at low speed to collect the resin. Resin carrying the expressed protein was then loaded into a 12-ml Bio-Rad glass column by gravity, and the resin was washed with 15 ml of buffer containing 10 mm imidazole (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole) to reduce nonspecific binding. Protein was then eluted using 10 ml of elution buffer containing 100 mm imidazole (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 100 mm imidazole) and concentrated by centrifugation using membrane concentrators with 3-kDa molecular mass cutoff (Centriprep, Amicon, Beverly, MA). Concentrated protein was further purified to homogeneity by C4 reverse phase HPLC. Separation was carried out over a gradient, from 100% Buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to 60% Buffer B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) in 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Purity was confirmed by silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels and amino acid composition. SDS-PAGE Electrophoresis and Protein Sequencing—Proteins were resolved on 12% NuPage gels (Invitrogen) run at 200 V for 1 h and visualized either by silver or Coomassie Blue staining. Once purified to homogeneity, protein identity was verified via NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing. Briefly, proteins to be sequenced were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride using a Bio-Rad Transblot apparatus for 1 h at 100 V, stained with Amido Black, and excised from the membrane. NH2-terminal sequence was determined by Edman degradation using an Applied Biosystems 477A protein sequencer (Dana Farber Microsequencing Facility, Boston, MA). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—Peptide sequences were designed to represent various smaller structural domains of the carboxyl terminus of TIMP-2. These include: a 10-amino acid peptide corresponding to Loop 5 with sequence TRCPMIPCYI, a 24-amino acid peptide corresponding to Loop 6 with sequence ECLWMDWVTEKNINGHQAKFFACI, and a 19-amino acid peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal tail with sequence AWYRGAAPPKQEFLDIEDP. A fourth peptide of sequence VIRAK corresponding to a conserved sequence in the NH2-terminal domain of all TIMPs was also synthesized for use as a control peptide. All four peptides were synthesized via Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis on Advanced ChemTech 396-5000 multiple peptide synthesizers (Advanced ChemTech, Louisville, KY) to yield peptides as a trifluoroacetic acid salt (ResGen, Invitrogen). Synthetic peptides were further purified by us using C18 reverse phase HPLC to remove any truncation products. Briefly, 1 mg of lyophilized peptide was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer A (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and loaded onto the column. Separation was carried out over a gradient, from 20% Buffer B to 60% Buffer B (0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) in 60 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions containing the peak of interest were collected by hand and subjected to mass spectroscopy to confirm identity and purity of the peptides. Yield was determined by amino acid composition. MMP Inhibitory Activity—MMP inhibitory activity was assessed using a quantitative [14C]collagen film assay, as described previously by us (2Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R. Science. 1990; 248: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Briefly, 14C-labeled collagen was added to 96-well plates and allowed to polymerize. To determine inhibitory activity, wells were treated with a known amount of activated type I collagenase plus test sample or with collagenase alone and the plates incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h to allow for release of 14C by the enzyme. Supernantants were then analyzed in a Wallac scintillation counter, and percent inhibition of collagenolytic activity was calculated. An IC50 unit was defined as the amount of protein necessary to inhibit the proteolytic activity of collagenase by 50%. Cell Culture and Capillary Endothelial Cell Proliferation—Capillary EC, isolated from bovine adrenal cortex, were a kind gift of Dr. Judah Folkman (Children's Hospital, Boston) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum (HyClone) and 3 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and grown at 37 °C in 10% CO2. Capillary EC proliferation was measured as reported previously by us (2Moses M.A. Sudhalter J. Langer R.

Briefly, capillary EC were plated on pregelatinized 96-well plates at a density of 2000 cells per well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and allowed to attach for 24 h. The next day, cells were treated with fresh medium with or without 1 ng/ml bFGF and challenged with the test proteins at various concentrations. All samples were tested in duplicate. Control wells contained cell treated with medium alone or medium with bFGF. After 72 h, the medium was removed, and the cells were lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100 and the phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, NaOH was added to each well to terminate the reaction and cell density was determined by colorimetric analysis using a SpectraMax 190 multiwell plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All samples were tested in duplicate in at least three independent experiments.

Briefly, 3-day-old chick embryos were removed from their shells and incubated in plastic Petri dishes for 3 days. On embryonic day 6, samples and controls mixed into methylcellulose discs were applied to the surfaces of developing CAMs, above the dense subectodermal plexus. After 48 h of incubation, the eggs were examined for vascular reactions under a dissecting scope (×60) and photographed. All samples were tested in triplicate for each dose tested and determinations were made by three independent members of the laboratory, in a double-blinded fashion. Mouse Corneal Pocket Assay—In vivo inhibition of angiogenesis was also tested using the mouse corneal pocket assay as described previously (27O'Reilly M.S. Holmgren L. Shing Y. Chen C. Rosenthal R.A.

Hydron pellets containing sucrose octasulfate and either test sample (5 μg) plus bFGF (40 ng) or bFGF (40 ng) alone were implanted into corneal micropockets of C57Bl/6. Each animal carried a pellet containing the test sample plus bFGF in one eye, and a control bFGF pellet in the contralateral eye. After 6 days, angiogenesis was evaluated using a slit lamp microscope, and each eye was photographed. The area of neovascularization for each cornea was calculated from the length of the vessels (VL) invading the cornea as well as the clock hours (CH) covered as described by the formula VL × CH × 0.0628. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of TIMP-2 and TIMP-2 Domains—Human TIMP-2 was cloned from a human heart cDNA library using high fidelity PCR and primers designed to produce full-length TIMP-2, a 3′-deletion fragment and a 5′-deletion fragment (Fig. 1B). Cloning of these gene fragments result in the expression of two deletion mutants of TIMP-2 as distinct peptides. The first is composed of the three NH2-terminal disulfide-bonded loops (Cys1–Glu127) designated T2N (∼15 kDa), and the second is composed of the three COOH-terminal disulfide-bonded loops (Cys128–Pro194) designated T2C (∼8.5 kDa). In addition, following recent reports suggesting that the addition of amino acid residues to the NH2-terminal Cys1 results in the abrogation of MMP-inhibitory activity (30Wingfield P.T. Sax J.K.

All expressed proteins were NH2-terminally sequenced to verify either native or mutant forms. All proteins, as well as intact human TIMP-2, were expressed using the Pichia pastoris yeast expression system, which has been shown to successfully produce other disulfide-bonded proteins (32Ikegaya K.

In most cells, glycosylation of LacCer, GM3, and GD3 to form higher order species (GA2, GM2, GD2, GM1, GD1b) is displaced toward the most distal aspects of the Golgi and the trans-Golgi network, where the involved transferases (GalNAcT and GalT2) form physical and functional associations. Glycosylation of the simple species LacCer, GM3, and GD3, on the other hand, is displaced toward more proximal Golgi compartments, and we investigate here whether the involved transferases (GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2) share the property of forming physical associations. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from membranes of CHO-K1 cells expressing epitope-tagged versions of these enzymes indicate that GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2 associate physically in a SialT1-dependent manner and that their N-terminal domains participate in these interactions. Microscopic fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in living cells confirmed the interactions, and in addition to showing a Golgi apparatus localization of the complexes, mapped their formation to the endoplasmic reticulum.

An important body of information on the topology of the synthesis came from studies of metabolic labeling in the presence of pharmacological agents such as monensin and brefeldin A (for a review, see Refs. 6Maccioni H.J.F.

The synthesis of complex gangliosides is more inhibited by monensin than the synthesis of the simple gangliosides GM3 and GD3 (9Miller-Prodraza H. Fishman P.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Klausner R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The metabolic labeling of glycolipids in different cell types in the presence of brefeldin A (14Young Jr., W.W. Lutz M.S. Mills S.E. Lechler-Osborn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 15Rosales Fritz V.M. Maccioni H.J.F. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1859-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) evidenced a block in the synthesis of gangliosides more complex than GM3 and GD3, indicating that reactions acting beyond GalNAcT are very limited in the proximal Golgi (see Fig. 1A). In fact, a direct examination of the sub-Golgi localization of GalNAcT, a key enzyme in the conversion of simple to complex gangliosides, showed this enzyme to be concentrated in the TGN (5Giraudo C.G. Rosales Fritz V.M. Maccioni H.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Recent studies have shown that GalNAcT and GalT2 associate physically in the distal Golgi membranes of CHO-K1 cells. In these complexes, the product of the first enzyme (GM2) is channeled as substrate for the second enzyme in GM1 formation (16Giraudo C.G. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This poses the question of whether other transferases form part of that complex or whether different complexes, each one constituted by different sets of transferases, do exist. In the present work, we examine whether enzymes acting on the synthesis of simple ganglioside species also show the property of forming physical associations. Using biochemical, pharmacological, and multiple color fluorescence imaging techniques in CHO-K1 cells expressing epitope-tagged versions of these enzymes, we found that GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2 participate in a multiprotein association distinct from the one formed by GalNAcT and GalT2. Evidence indicates that the GalNAcT/GalT2 complex concentrates in a sub-Golgi compartment more distal than the one bearing the GalT1/SialT1/SialT2 complex and traced its formation to the ER.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-c-Myc and anti-His antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-HA antibodies were from Berkeley Antibody, Richmond, CA. Monoclonal anti-GFP antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Monoclonal anti-FLAG was from Sigma.Molecular Constructs—GalNAcT-Myc, GalT2-HA, and vectors containing the cDNA coding for the N-terminal domains of GalNAcT, GalT2, and ManII fused to the N terminus of the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), or to the Ds-red fluorescent protein (RFP) were constructed as indicated (16Giraudo C.G. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). ΔGalT2-CFP, GalT2RR7→AA-YFP, and GalNAcTRR5→AA-YFP were generated as described (17Giraudo C.G. Maccioni H.J.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3753-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). SialT1-FLAG and GalT1-His were generated by PCR amplification of the corresponding mouse cDNAs (kindly provided by Dr. R. Proia) using reverse primers that mutated the stop codon and introduced the sequences codifying the FLAG or His epitope, respectively. The PCR products were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCI-neo (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Vectors containing the cDNA coding for the N-terminal domains of SialT2 (amino acids 1-57), SialT1 (amino acids 1-54), and GalT1 (amino acids 1-52) fused to the N terminus of CFP, YFP, or RFP were generated by PCR amplification of the indicated region and subcloning the PCR products into the corresponding plasmid coding the different fluorescence proteins.Cell Culture and Transfection—CHO-K1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Immunoprecipitation Experiments—Cells (200 μg of protein) were lysed during 60 min on ice with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HCl-Tris, pH 7.2, 1.0% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μm pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% sodium azide). Lysates were preabsorbed with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, 75% suspension washed with lysis buffer prior to use) for 60 min on ice. Aliquots of supernatants were incubated overnight on a rotating wheel at 4 °C with specific antibodies as will be indicated in each case. Immunocomplexes were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 10 s and then washed five times at 4 °C with lysis buffer and three times with 150 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 10 mm EDTA for immunoblotting.Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells stably expressing constructs of CFP, YFP, or RFP fused at the C terminus of the N-terminal domains of Golgi proteins were grown in DMEM on chambered coverglasses (LabTek, Naperville, IL) and observed on a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope. For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) determinations, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the chambered coverglasses were placed under the culture chamber of the Axiovert 135M inverted fluorescence microscope at 37 °C and in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air for examination. Fluorescence microscopy and quantitative microscopic FRET were as described (16Giraudo C.G. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Imaging processing for pseudocolor and fluorescence quantitation were carried out with the Metamorph 4.5 Imaging System (Universal Imaging Corporation, West Chester, PA); the autoscale function was applied during acquisition of images to optimize their visualization. Final images were compiled with Adobe PhotoShop 6.0. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were carried out with a Zeiss LSM-510 confocal microscope equipped with a culture chamber set at 5% CO2 in air and 37 °C, using a ×100 Plan Neofluar objective. The Golgi area was selected in a focus plane so that it was clearly visible. The volume of the organelle, which usually comprised about 1-2 μm above and below the focal plane, was determined defining the upper and lower Z-limits. The Golgi selected volume was irreversibly photobleached by successive scanning through the Z-series at 100% of the laser power of both 458 and 514 nm. Images were taken every 1 min during 120 min of recovery. Thirty min before and during the time course of the bleaching experiments, cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml cycloheximide to ensure that no fluorescence was gained due to protein synthesis.RESULTSSialT2, SialT1, and GalT1 Co-immunoprecipitate in Triple Transfectant CHO-K1 Cells—Previous studies of the incorporation of radioactive sugars into endogenous glycolipid acceptors revealed the coexistence of glycosyltransferases in isolated Golgi membrane vesicles. This coexistence was functional since products of one transfer step coupled as substrates for the next step in vitro in the absence of vesicular transport (2Maxzúd M.K. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20207-20214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that for the distal Golgi-located GalNAcT and GalT2, the functional coupling implies a physical association between them, forming a multienzyme complex in which the substrates GM3 and GM2 are channeled toward the final product GM1 (16Giraudo C.G. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To examine whether enzymes catalyzing the transfer steps operative in the proximal Golgi (GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2, Fig. 1A) organize in the form of complexes, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the HA-tagged, full-length form of SialT2 (SialT2-HA) (18Daniotti J.L. Martina J.A. Giraudo C.G. Zurita A.R. Maccioni H.J. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1711-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were co-transfected with SialT1 or with GalT1 tagged at the C terminus with FLAG or His epitopes, respectively (Fig. 1B). Fifteen h after transfection, lysates of either SialT2-HA/SialT1-FLAG or SialT2-HA/GalT1-His transfectant cells were immunoprecipitated respectively with anti-HA or anti-FLAG (Fig. 2A) or with anti-HA or anti-His (Fig. 2B) antibodies and Western-blotted with the appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of SialT2-HA, SialT1-FLAG, or GalT1-His revealed that SialT2-HA and SialT1-FLAG were able to mutually co-immunoprecipitate, indicating that these two enzymes form physical associations capable of being detected with this methodology. However, co-IP of GalT1-His and SialT2-HA, if it occurred, was under the limit of detection of the technique (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2 co-immunoprecipitate. Lysates of double transfectant CHO-K1 cells stably expressing SialT2-HA and transiently expressing SialT1-FLAG (A) or GalT1-His (B) or of triple transfectant cells stably expressing SialT2-HA and transiently expressing SialT1-FLAG and GalT1-His (C) were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies anti-HA, anti-FLAG, or anti-His, and the immunocomplexes were Western-blotted with anti-HA or anti-His polyclonal antibodies or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further examine the lack of co-IP between GalT1-His and SialT2-HA and to examine a possible association between GalT1-His and SialT1-FLAG, we carried out a similar co-IP experiment but using lysates from triple transfectant cells stably expressing SialT2-HA and transiently expressing SialT1-FLAG and GalT1-His. Results in Fig. 2C show that SialT1-FLAG and GalT1-His mutually co-immunoprecipitate, and interestingly, that in this case, the co-IP of SialT2-HA and GalT1-His became evident. These results indicate that a GalT1-His/SialT1-FLAG/SialT2-HA complex was formed in the triple transfectant cells and that SialT1-FLAG critically influenced the organization of such a complex, suggesting a SialT1-FLAG-mediated interaction between GalT1-His and SialT2-HA. The simplest interpretation for the lack of detection of the GalT1-His/SialT1(endogenous)/SialT2-HA complex in the double (SialT2-HA and GalT1-His) transfectant cells (Fig. 2B) is that the endogenous amount of SialT1 may have limited the amount of ternary complex formed to undetectable levels.GalNAcT and GalT2 Fail to Co-Immunoprecipitate with SialT2, SialT1, and GalT1—It was reported that GalNAcT and GalT2 mutually interact in CHO-K1 cells (16Giraudo C.G. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and also that GalNAcT interacts with SialT2 in F-11 cells (19Bieberich E.

We considered it of interest to examine whether interactions of GalNAcT or GalT2 with GalT1, SialT1, or SialT2 occur in CHO-K1 cells. We first examined whether GalNAcT interacts with SialT2. To this end, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the c-Myc-tagged full-length form of GalNAcT (GalNAcT-Myc) were co-transfected with HA-tagged forms of GalT2, SialT2, or TGN38 (Fig. 3A). TGN38 was included in the experiment as a control of a Golgi-resident protein not related to the glycosyltransferase family. It is clear in the experiment of Fig. 3A that although GalT2-HA and GalNAcT-Myc mutually co-immunoprecipitate (upper row), GalNAcT-Myc was unable to co-immunoprecipitate either SialT2-HA (middle row) or TGN38-HA (lower row) at detectable levels, and vice versa.Fig. 3GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2 interact poorly with GalNAcT and GalT2. As shown in A, a CHO-K1 cell clone stably expressing GalNAcT-Myc was transfected with GalT2-HA, SialT2-HA, or TGN38-HA. Fifteen h after transfection, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc or anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, and the immunocomplexes were Western-blotted with anti-HA or anti-c-Myc polyclonal antibodies as indicated. As shown in B, lysates of CHO-K1 cells stably expressing either GalNAcT-Myc or GalT2-HA and transiently expressing SialT1-FLAG were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG or anti-c-Myc (left panel) or with anti-FLAG and anti-HA (right panel) monoclonal antibodies, and the immunocomplexes were Western-blotted with the appropriate antibodies as indicated. As shown in C, lysates of CHO-K1 cells stably expressing either GalNAcT-Myc or GalT2-HA and co-transfected with GalT1-His were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA or anti-c-Myc or anti-His, and the immunocomplexes were Western-blotted with the appropriate antibodies as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then examined whether GalT2-HA and/or GalNAcT-Myc were able to co-immunoprecipitate SialT1-FLAG in cells stably expressing either GalNAcT-Myc or GalT2-HA and transiently expressing SialT1-FLAG. It was clear from data of Fig. 3B that co-IP of GalNAcT-Myc and SialT1-FLAG, (left panel) or of GalT2-HA and SialT1-FLAG (right panel), if it occurred, was below the limit of detection. Finally, we examined whether GalNAcT-Myc and GalT2-HA were able to co-immunoprecipitate GalT1-His. Fig. 3C shows that neither GalT2-HA nor GalNAcT-Myc, which mutually co-immunoprecipitate, were able to co-immunoprecipitate GalT1-His at detectable levels, and vice versa. Thus, results from co-IP experiments of Figs. 2 and 3 evidence at least two sets of interacting proteins, one formed by GalNAcT-Myc and GalT2-HA and another formed by GalT1-His, SialT1-FLAG, and SialT2-HA.The N-terminal Domains of GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2 Participate in the Interactions—We next analyzed whether the N-terminal domains of GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2 play a role in their mutual association. For this, CHO-K1 cells stably expressing SialT2-HA were co-transfected with GalT1-His and the N-terminal domain of SialT1 (comprising amino acids 1-54) fused to YFP. Results of Fig. 4 show that both full-length constructs, SialT2-HA and GalT1-His, were able to co-immunoprecipitate the truncated version of SialT1, and vice versa. In addition, the N-terminal domains of SialT2 and GalT1, comprising amino acids 1-57 and amino acids 1-52, respectively, fused to the YFP (Fig. 1B), were also able to co-immunoprecipitate with the other members of the complex (not shown). These results indicate, as for the case of GalNAcT and GalT2 complex (16Giraudo C.G. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), that the N-terminal domains are involved in the interactions among these three enzymes.Fig. 4The N-terminal domain participates in the interactions. CHO-K1 cells were co-transfected with GalT1-His, SialT2-HA, and the N-terminal domain of SialT1 comprising amino acids 1-54 fused to YFP. A lysate from the expressing cells was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, anti-GFP, or anti-His monoclonal antibodies, and the immunocomplexes were Western-blotted with anti-HA or anti-His polyclonal antibodies or with anti-GFP monoclonal antibody as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) in Living Cells—To analyze whether the GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2 interactions observed in vitro also occur in living cells, we expressed paired constructs of the N-terminal domain of these enzymes fused to CFP or YFP (Fig. 1B) in all possible combinations, and microscopic FRET was determined. All the fluorescent constructs mainly localized in the Golgi complex (Fig. 5), colocalizing with the endogenous Golgi marker ManII (16Giraudo C.G. Daniotti J.L. Maccioni H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1625-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A significant FRET signal was detected between SialT1-CFP and GalT1-YFP (first row) and between SialT1-CFP and SialT2-YFP (second row). FRET between GalT1-CFP and SialT2-YFP was only detected in cells also co-expressing SialT1 (third row). FRET signals between either member of the GalNAcT/GalT2 complex and GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2 were at background levels. Images in the fourth and fifth row of Fig. 5 are representative of those showing no FRET between SialT1-CFP and GalNAcT-YFP and between GalNAcT-CFP and SialT2-YFP, respectively. Quantitative analyses of FRET (FRETN), which normalizes the FRET signal to the concentration of both donor and acceptor fluorophores, are given for each pair in Table I. Significant FRETN values were observed for the pairs GalT1/SialT1, SialT1/SialT2, and GalNacT/GalT2 and for GalT1/SialT2 in cells co-expressing GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2. FRETN values between either GalNAcT or GalT2 and GalT1, or SialT1 or SialT2 (in cells co-expressing or not co-expressing SialT1), were at background level. To further analyze FRET between constructs, the alternative procedure of measuring FRET by acceptor (YFP) photobleaching under the laser scanning confocal microscope (20Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) was also applied in pairs SialT2-CFP/SialT1-YFP and SialT2-CFP/GalNAcT-YFP. A significant increase of about 40% in CFP fluorescence was observed in the pair SialT2/SialT1, whereas no significant increase was observed in the pair SialT2/GalNAcT (see Supplementary Fig. 1), confirming FRET data obtained by the three filter set method used in Fig. 5. These data are compatible with the possibility that the Golgi ganglioside glycosylating system is split into at least two multiprotein complexes, one containing GalT1, SialT1, and SialT2, engaged in the synthesis of simple glycolipids and gangliosides (LacCer, GM3 and GD3) and the other containing GalNAcT and GalT2, involved in the synthesis of complex gangliosides (GM2, GD2, GM1, GD1b, etc.).Fig. 5FRET experiments reveal distinct interactions between ganglioside glycosyltransferases in living cells. CHO-K1 cells co-transfected with the indicated paired fluorescent constructs were observed under the fluorescence microscope with CFP, YFP, or FRET filter sets. Arrows indicate colocalization in the Golgi region of the different fluorescent constructs. Arrowheads indicate regions of the Golgi in which truncated versions of GalT1 and SialT1 (first row) or of SialT1 and SialT2 (second row) or of GalT1 and SialT2 co-expressed with the full-length SialT1 (third row) were close enough as to undergo FRET as shown in the FRET column. No significant FRET signal between SialT1 and GalNAcT (fourth row) or SialT2 and GalNAcT (fifth row) was observed.

Open table in a new tab Nocodazole-induced Golgi Vesicles Disclose Different Sub-Golgi Localization of GalT1/SialT1/SialT2 and GalNAcT/GalT2 Complexes—The possibility was considered that the distinct multiprotein complexes inferred from results of the experiments described above concentrate in different sub-Golgi compartments. To examine this possibility, we took advantage of the property of nocodazole of inducing the generalized appearance of Golgi membrane vesicles. This is a consequence of the disassembling of the microtubule network that impedes translocation of such vesicles to the Golgi complex on microtubule tracks. It was reported that reemerging microvesicles with trans-Golgi/TGN components appear earlier than those carrying components of other regions of the Golgi com"

These responses were associated with synthesis of p-coumaroyloctopamine and p-coumaroylnoradrenaline, a novel compound for plants. In susceptible near isogenic tomato lines (Cf-0, pto, fen) and wounded tomato leaves, the levels of these compounds were reduced or undetectable. The elevated levels of p-coumaroyloctopamine and p-coumaroylnoradrenaline were accompanied by elevated mRNA levels of genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase, p-coumarate CoA ligase, and hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase (THT), enzymes that are involved in the hydroxycinnamic acid amide biosynthesis. Southern hybridization indicated that THT is encoded by a multigene family in tomato. Four different THT full-length cDNAs were derived by reverse transcriptase-PCR using degenerate primers based on potato and tobacco THT sequences.

Plant defense against microbial attack is associated with activation of plant responses that serve to restrict the growth of the pathogen and/or to eliminate it. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating many of these responses and how they are triggered following recognition of molecules of pathogen origin by the plant (reviewed in Refs. 1Scheel D. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 4: 305-310Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 2Nürnberger T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 167-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Bonas U. Lahaye T. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). It is widely observed that plant resistance to pathogen challenge is correlated with alterations in phenolic metabolism and a rapid increase in the transcriptional activity of genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. A number of products synthesized by this pathway have established roles in disease resistance in different plants; these include the signal molecule salicylic acid, antimicrobial phytoalexins, and lignin that can reinforce the plant cell wall (reviewed in Refs. 4Dixon R.A. Achnine L. Kota P. Liu C.-J. Srinivasa Reddy M.S. Wang L. Mol. Plant Pathol. 2002; 3: 371-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar and 5Dixon R.A. Nature. 2001; 411: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The work described in this paper had the initial aim of identifying further metabolites, originating from the phenylpropanoid pathway, that might play roles in disease resistance in tomato. We have compared the synthesis of soluble phenolics in response to both biotic (fungal elicitors, pathogenic bacteria) and abiotic agents (the organophosphorous insecticide fenitrothion) using nearly isogenic tomato lines that differ in their response to these agents. The resistance of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum L.) to the fungus Cladosporium fulvum (C. fulvum) is conditioned by the presence of Cf resistance gene(s) in the plant together with the cognate avirulence (avr) gene(s) in the pathogen (6Joosten M. de Wit P. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1999; 37: 335-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The products of a number of avr genes are peptides that are found in intercellular fluids derived from C. fulvum-infected tomato leaves. These intercellular fluids induce chlorosis and necrosis in tomato in a Cf gene-dependent fashion (7De Wit P. Spikman G. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1982; 21: 1-11Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar).These responses are associated with increases in the levels of salicylic acid, indicating activation of the phenylpropanoid pathway (8Hammond-Kosack K.E. Silverman P. Raskin I. Jones J.D.G. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 1381-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Tomato lines carrying the Pto gene are resistant to strains of Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato that carry the avirulence gene avrPto (Pst (avrPto)) (9Ronald P.C. Salmeron J.M. Carland F.M. Mehta A.Y. Staskawicz B.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These strains cause a programmed cell death reaction, the hypersensitive response (HR), 1The abbreviations used are: HR, hypersensitive response; p-CO, p-coumaroyloctopamine; p-CN, p-coumaroylnoradrenaline; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; cfu, colony-forming units; hpi, hours post inoculation; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; p-CT, p-coumaroyltyramine; FT, feruloyltyramine; EST, expressed sequence tag; THT, hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase; PAL, phenylalanine ammonia lyase; 4CL, 4-coumarate CoA ligase. when infiltrated into leaves. In contrast, tomato lines carrying the recessive pto allele do not show HR and are susceptible to infection by Pst (avrPto). The Fen gene, which is closely linked to Pto and belongs to the Pto gene family of serine threonine protein kinases, confers sensitivity to the organophosphorous insecticide fenthion (10Martin G.B. Frary A. Wu T. Brommonschenkel S. Chunwongse J. Earle E.D. Tanksley S.D. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1543-1552PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of Fen plants with fenthion or its analog fenitrothion results in a confluent necrotic reaction that resembles the HR, whereas fen plants show only sporadic appearance of necrotic spots (10Martin G.B. Frary A. Wu T. Brommonschenkel S. Chunwongse J. Earle E.D. Tanksley S.D. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1543-1552PubMed Google Scholar, 11Laterrot H. TGC Report Res. Notes. 1985; 35: 6Google Scholar). Both the Fen and Pto signaling pathways to cell death require the Prf gene (12Salmeron J.M. Barker S.J. Carland F.M. Mehta A.Y. Staskawicz B.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); mutant lines carrying nonfunctional alleles (prf) show much lower sensitivity to fenthion and no HR in response to Pst (avrPto). By monitoring the profile of soluble phenolics, we have shown preferential induction of the synthesis of two phenolic compounds in those interactions that are associated with resistance. This is seen with both biotic elicitation and fenitrothion treatment. We identified these two metabolites as p-coumaroyloctopamine (p-CO) and p-coumaroylnoradrenaline (p-CN). Conjugates of hydroxycinnamic acids with tyramine and derivatives of tyramine, such as dopamine, methoxytyramine, and octopamine, are found in a wide range of plants. Synthesis of these amides has been shown previously to be activated by treatment with fungal elicitors, by attempted infection by fungi, viruses, and bacteria, and in some cases by wounding (13Negrel J.

Phytochemistry. 1998; 47: 659-664Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, as far as we are aware, this is the first description of the occurrence of p-CN in plants and consequently of its association with plant defense. The biosynthesis of p-CO and p-CN occurs by the condensation of the CoA derivative of p-coumaric acid with octopamine and noradrenaline, catalyzed by the enzyme hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:tyramine N-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase (THT; EC 2.3.1.110). The enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL; EC 4.3.1.5), and 4-coumarate CoA ligase (4CL; EC 6.2.1.12) are involved in the synthesis of p-coumaroyl-CoA; octopamine and noradrenaline are synthesized in a number of steps from tyrosine. The biosynthetic pathway for p-coumaroyltyramine is shown in Fig. 1. THT has been purified from potato, tobacco, and opium poppy, and the specificity for different acceptors has been established (20Negrel J. Javelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21Hohlfeld H. Scheel D. Strack D. Planta. 1996; 199: 166-168Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 22Yu M. Facchini P.J. Planta. 1999; 209: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All enzymes have wide substrate specificity, although in the case of tobacco and potato, noradrenaline is the least favored acceptor (no experiments were performed with THT from opium poppy using noradrenaline as acceptor). In potato and tobacco, it has been shown that THT is encoded by a multigene family (23Schmidt A. Grimm R. Schmidt J. Scheel D. Strack D. Rosahl S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4273-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Farmer M.J. Czernic P. Michael A. Negrel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 686-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is not known whether all genes encode active proteins with similar substrate preferences. So far, three THT cDNAs have been cloned from tobacco, one from potato as well as one from pepper (23Schmidt A. Grimm R. Schmidt J. Scheel D. Strack D. Rosahl S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4273-4280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Farmer M.J. Czernic P. Michael A. Negrel J. Eur. J.

Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We have taken several approaches to investigate possible mechanisms underlying the enhanced synthesis of p-CO and p-CN during defense reactions in tomato. First, we have examined the transcriptional activity of several genes (PAL, 4CL, and THT) whose products are implicated in p-CO and p-CN biosynthesis. Second, we have used the sequences of the potato and tobacco THT genes to isolate four different tomato THT homologs and have examined the expression of these different THT genes after bacterial challenge. Finally, we have compared the acceptor preferences for the different recombinant THT enzymes. We report that the increased p-CO and p-CN synthesis is associated with the accumulation of transcripts for PAL, 4CL, and THT, although gene-specific analysis indicates that the different THT genes are differentially regulated upon bacterial challenge of plants. We also report that the different THT isoforms in tomato have different acceptor preferences and that the isoform that is most highly expressed upon bacterial challenge has a significantly higher affinity for noradrenaline than either the potato or tobacco enzymes. Plant Material and Growth Conditions—For experiments with C. fulvum elicitors, the tomato cultivar Moneymaker (Cf-0) and two nearly isogenic lines homozygous for the resistance genes Cf-9 and Cf-2 were used. Plants were grown either to the sixth leaf stage (6 weeks) or to the cotyledon stage (3 weeks) in a growth room in Levington's M3 compost (Levington Horticulture Ltd., Fisons, Ipswich, UK) with a photoperiod of 16 h (light intensity of 100 microeinsteins). Growth room temperatures were 20 °C in the light and 16 °C in the dark. For the bacterial infection experiments, the tomato cultivar Rio Grande 76R carrying a functional Pto and Fen gene and a nearly isogenic line 76S (pto and fen) were grown to the sixth leaf stage. In addition, the nearly isogenic fast neutron-induced mutant lines cv. Rio Grande 76R prf3, prf9, and prf2 lacking a functional Prf gene were included in the experiments (12Salmeron J.M. Barker S.J. Carland F.M. Mehta A.Y. Staskawicz B.J. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Plants to be challenged by bacteria or the insecticide fenitrothion were grown under the same light conditions as stated above but at a constant temperature of 22 °C. Fungal, Bacterial, and Chemical Elicitation and Wounding—The source of C. fulvum peptide elicitors Avr2 and Avr9 were intercellular washing fluids originating from tomato plants heavily infected by C. fulvum race 5 (referred to as IFAvr9) (26Hammond-Kosack K.E. Jones D.A. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 361-374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For controls, intercellular fluids from healthy, noninfected plants (referred to as IF0) were used. For the time course analyses, the IF preparations were infiltrated with a blunt syringe in the intercellular space of tomato cotyledons previously nicked by a razor blade. For all other experiments, adult leaves were infiltrated. P. syringae pathovar tomato carrying the avrPto gene (Pst (avrPto)) (27Oldroyd G.E.D. Staskawicz B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1954; 44: 301-307PubMed Google Scholar) containing the respective antibiotics. After centrifugation, the bacteria were suspended in 10 mm MgCl2 to the appropriate concentration and infiltrated in the leaves as described above. For the chemical elicitation, the fenthion analog, fenitrothion, was used. The insecticide is available in the United Kingdom under the product name Dicofen (kindly provided by PBI Agrochemicals Ltd., Waltham Abbey, UK). Mature tomato leaflets were immersed for 30 s in a solution of 1% (w/v) fenitrothion containing 0.05% l-77-Silwett (Union Carbide). For wounding, plants were subjected to mechanical injury by gently rubbing the leaves with carborundum (320 grit powder; Fisher). The abrasive was then removed by careful rinsing with tap water. Analysis of Free Phenolics—Extraction and analysis of the phenolics were performed essentially as described previously (30Von Röpenack E. Parr A. Schulze-Lefert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9013-9022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In short, 3–4 mg of freeze-dried plant material was extracted with 70% methanol and analyzed via reverse phase HPLC using a Prodigy 5 ODS-2 column (25 cm × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex Ltd., Macclesfield, UK). The following binary gradient, with a flow rate of 1 ml min–1, was applied for elution: t = 0 min, 10% A; t = 20 min, 16% A; t = 40 min, 50% A; t = 45 min, 75% A; t = 50 min, 95% A; t = 55 min, 10% A). Solvent A was methanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v), solvent B was 10 mm ammonium formate, pH 3. Absorbences were measured with a diode array-scanning UV detector (Gilson, Middleton, WI). Quantification was accomplished using the standards derived from the enzyme assays (see “THT Enzyme Assay”). The molecular weight (M r) and structures of peaks 6 and 8 were determined by liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI MS). The conditions for LC/ESI MS have been stated before (30Von Röpenack E. Parr A. Schulze-Lefert P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9013-9022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Test for Antimicrobial Activity—Cultures of Pst (avrPto) were grown overnight at 28 °C in a rotary shaker in M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.4% citrate, 25 mm MgSO4, and rifampicin (50 μg/ml) (31Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 1.1.1Google Scholar). The bacterial concentrations were adjusted to 1 × 104 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml by dilution into new broth. Samples of p-CN and p-CO derived by HPLC fractionation were lyophilized and redissolved in 35% MeOH to give a stock solution of 1 mm. To exclude inhibitory activity of putative impurities in the volatile HPLC fractions, a blank HPLC run was subjected to the same collection procedure as applied for p-CN and p-CO. The two blank fractions were combined, lyophilized, and redissolved in methanol in the same way. The phenolics and the blank control were added to the diluted bacterial cultures, which were incubated as above for a further 24 h. Bacterial viable counts were then determined by plating serial dilutions onto Kings B agar plates containing rifampicin. The experiment was performed on triplicate cultures and repeated three times. Southern Analysis—High molecular weight DNA from pepper (Capsicum annuum cv. Early Calwonder ECW 10R), tomato (L. esculentum cv. Moneymaker), potato (Solanum tuberosum cv. Hunkel), tobacco (Nicotiana clevlandii), and barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Franka) was isolated (as described in Refs. 32Thomas C.M. Vos P. Zabeau M. Jones D.A. Norcott K.A. Chadwick B.P. Jones J.D.G.

Samples (0.7, 1.4, 1.4, 1.4, and 2.8 μg, respectively) were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science). The nonradioactive hybridization was performed by using a digoxygenin-labeled potato THT cDNA (23Schmidt A. Grimm R. Schmidt J. Scheel D. Strack D. Rosahl S. J. Biol.

BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The blots were hybridized at 36 °C and washed in 1× SSC at 50 °C. RNA Isolation and Characterization for Northern Blot Analysis— Total RNA was extracted from frozen leaf material at various time points after inoculation with Pst (avrPto) (107 cfu/ml) or from control tissue using the Tripure Isolation Reagent (Roche Applied Science). For Northern blots, RNA samples (10 μg of total RNA) were separated on formaldehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The integrity of the RNA was assessed by visualization of ribosomal RNA by ethidium bromide staining. The cDNA probes for PAL (35Lee S.W. Nazar R.N. Powell D.A. Robb J. Plant Mol.

Parr A. Daniels M.J. Dow J.M. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cloning of the Tomato THT Genes—Two degenerate primer pairs were designed based on the consensus sequence of potato and tobacco THT (23Schmidt A. Grimm R. Schmidt J. Scheel D. Strack D. Rosahl S. J.

Reverse transcriptase-PCR (Titan™ One Tube reverse transcriptase-PCR system; Roche Applied Science) was carried out by using the primer combinations t1f/t3r and t2f/t4r on total RNA extracted from 76R plants 0, 4, 10, and 16 h postinoculation (hpi). The PCR profile was designed according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight alterations (incubation temperature, 55 °C; denaturation time, 10 s; annealing temperature, 50 °C; 10 + 39 cycles). The amplification products were loaded on 1% agarose gels and separated by electrophoresis. Amplified DNA was extracted from gels and subcloned into the vector pGEM-T (Promega). Ten clones from each primer combination per given time point were sequenced. For the isolation of the tomato THT full-length cDNAs, mRNA was purified by using oligo(dT)-cellulose spin columns (Amersham Biosciences). The starting material consisted of a pool of total RNA samples of various time points after bacterial infection. The 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was carried out with gene-specific primers designed for each of the four candidate clones (Marathon™ cDNA amplification kit; Clontech; details for primer sequences and PCR profile available on request). Finally, full-length clones were amplified using primers containing BamHI (5′-end) and HindIII (3′-end) restriction sites to facilitate subsequent transfer into an expression vector. Candidate clones were sequenced to check for congruent results of full-length amplification and 5′–3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends nucleotide analysis. The sequences of the four cDNAs were analyzed in silico by using the programs BlastP2.2.3 and ProtParamtool (available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.ch). The alignment of the various sequences was performed applying the clustal method (gap penalty, 30; gap length penalty, 20; weight table, Pam 250). Real Time PCR Analysis of the Tomato THT Homologs—The tomato cultivars Rio Grande 76R and 76S were infiltrated with Pst (avrPto) at a concentration of 107 cfu/ml. Single leaf discs (1 cm diameter) were cut out at 0, 4, 10, 16, and 24 hpi and frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using the RNAeasy plant miniprep kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Subsequently, 2.5 μg of cDNA were synthesized by reverse transcription using the Revert Aid First Strand Synthesis Kit as described in the manual (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Real time PCR was carried out on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) featuring a reaction mixture with Sybr Green as fluorescent dye and 1 μl of template cDNA in dilutions of 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:50 (38Karsai A. Müller S. Platz S. Hauser M. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar); details for primer sequences and PCR profile are available on request. Amplicons were subjected to melting curve analysis (60–95 °C, 0.5 °C increments) and digested with HinfI, resulting in sequence-specific restriction patterns to assure amplification specificity. Message levels were determined as octuplicates at different dilutions (duplicates of each dilution; see above). Tomato Ef1α (accession number X53043) was used as constitutive standard. The level of THT cDNAs were normalized using the level of Ef1α cDNA as described in the ABI user bulletin 2. Expression of Tomato THT cDNAs in Escherichia coli—The plasmids containing the coding region of the THT clones were digested with BamHI and HindIII, and the insert DNA was ligated into the expression vector pQUE-30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).The construct was transformed into the E. coli strain M15(pREP4). Growth and induction of positive clones were performed as described by the manufacturer. The bacterial cultures were diluted to OD 0.3. After centrifugation of a 250-μl aliquot, the pellet formed was resuspended in 25 μl of SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, sonicated, and boiled for 5 min. These samples were spun down, and the supernatants were separated on 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (39Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), followed by staining with Colloidal Brilliant Blue (Sigma). For determination of THT activity, bacterial pellets were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and were broken by three passages through the French press. After centrifugation to remove cell debris, the supernatant was stored at –80 °C. THT Enzyme Assay—The substrate p-coumaroyl-CoA was enzymatically synthesized essentially as described by Meng and Campbell (40Meng H. Campbell W.H. Phytochemistry. 1997; 44: 605-608Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using a recombinant tobacco 4CL (36Lee D. Douglas C.J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was applied to a C18 Varian Bond Elut Extraction Cartridge (Phenomenex), and the CoA-conjugate was selectively eluted with acetonitrile/water (1:3, v/v). The material was lyophilized, and its purity was checked by HPLC. For the THT assay, 50 μl of THT enzyme solution (4 μg/μl) were mixed with 200 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 μlof p-coumaroyl-CoA (1 mm), and 5 μl of tyramine, dopamine, octopamine, and noradrenaline to a final concentration ranging from 0.01 to 0.5 mm. After 10 min at 25 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The assay mixture was spun down, and 200 μl of the supernatant were subjected to reverse phase HPLC analysis on a C18 column, exactly as described earlier for the phenolic analysis. The amine conjugates were identified by retention time and UV spectra. The Km values for the different acceptor amines were calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots from double measurements at each concentration. Differential Accumulation of Phenolics in Response to Fungal Elicitors—Intercellular fluid containing the C. fulvum Avr9 and Avr2 peptides (IFAvr9) was used for infiltration of resistant (Cf-9) and susceptible (Cf-0) tomato plants. At 12–16 hpi, a graying necrosis could be seen in the incompatible interaction (Fig. 2A, Cf-9), whereas no macroscopic symptoms could be detected for the Cf-0 plants (Fig. 2A, Cf-0). The production of soluble phenolics during these interactions was monitored by HPLC analysis of extracts from the infiltrated leaf areas. Of 13 detectable compounds, only two (referred to as peaks 6 and 8) showed a reliable alteration over three independent time course experiments (Figs. 2A and 3A). Tomato Cf-9 cotyledons infiltrated with IFAvr9 showed an accumulation of the peak 6 compound starting at 15 hpi and the peak 8 compound starting at 6 hpi. The maximum level of the two substances induced in Cf-9 plants were achieved at 21 hpi; thereafter, the levels declined rapidly. The levels at the maximum values were ∼20- and 80-fold higher, respectively, than in Cf-0 plants. In Cf-9 cotyledons infiltrated with IF0 (containing no Avr peptides), an accumulation of the peak 8 compound was observed beginning at 6 hpi and reaching a maximum value at 9 hpi (Fig. 3A). The maximum level was ∼10-fold lower than that seen with IFAvr9; thereafter, the level declined slowly. There was no accumulation of the peak 6 compound in this interaction. To show that the induction of the two phenolics was not just specific for interactions involving Cf-9, a comparable experiment using Cf-2 plants was carried out. At 24 h after IFAvr9 inoculation, chlorosis could be seen in the incompatible Cf-2 interaction, correl"

In this study we provide evidence that a novel class of intracellular β1-2 mannan oligosaccharides is important for parasite survival in host macrophages. Mannan (degree of polymerization 4-40) is expressed at low levels in non-pathogenic promastigote stages but constitutes 80 and 90% of the cellular carbohydrate in the two developmental stages that infect macrophages, non-dividing promastigotes, and lesion-derived amastigotes, respectively. Mannan is catabolized when parasites are starved of glucose, suggesting a reserve function, and developmental stages having low mannan levels or L. mexicana GDPMP mutants lacking all mannose molecules are highly sensitive to glucose starvation. Environmental stresses, such as mild heat shock or the heat shock protein-90 inhibitor, geldanamycin, that trigger the differentiation of promastigotes to amastigotes, result in a 10-25-fold increase in mannan levels. Developmental stages with low mannan levels or L. mexicana mutants lacking mannan do not survive heat shock and are unable to differentiate to amastigotes or infect macrophages in vitro. In contrast, a L. mexicana mutant deficient only in components of the mannose-rich surface glycocalyx differentiates normally and infects macrophages in vitro. Collectively, these data provide strong evidence that mannan accumulation is important for parasite differentiation and survival in macrophages.

Collectively, these data provide strong evidence that mannan accumulation is important for parasite differentiation and survival in macrophages. Leishmania species are sandfly-transmitted protozoan parasites that cause a number of human diseases, ranging from self-healing cutaneous lesions to fatal visceral infections, afflicting more than 12 million people worldwide (www.who.int/inf-fs/en/fact116.html). These parasites develop within the midgut of the sandfly vector, initially as rapidly dividing procyclic promastigotes and subsequently as non-dividing, but highly virulent, metacyclic promastigotes. Upon transmission to the mammalian host, metacyclic promastigotes invade macrophages and differentiate to the amastigote stage that proliferates within the phagolysosomal compartment. Parasite survival within the highly acidic and hydrolytic environment of the phagolysosome is likely to involve the induction of a number of biochemical processes, such as the activation of a heat shock response (1Wiesgigl M. Clos J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3307-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and the stage-specific expression of specific nutrient transporters (2Burchmore R.J.S. Rodriguez-Contreras D.

It has recently been reported that one or more mannose (Man)-containing molecules are essential for L. mexicana survival in macrophages and infectivity in animals (3Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Garami A. Mehlert A. Ilg T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8168-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Specifically, targeted deletion of genes involved in GDP-Man synthesis, such as phosphomannomutase and GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase (GDPMP), 1The abbreviations used are: GDPMP, GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; GIPL, glycoinositol-phospholipid; iFBS, heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum; LA, lesion-derived amastigotes; LP, log phase promastigotes; LPG, lipophosphoglycan; PPG, proteophosphoglycan; SP, stationary phase promastigotes; NNL, neutral non-lipidic; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; HPTLC, high performance thin layer chromatography; dp, degree of polymerization; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; WT, wild type; GA, geldanamycin; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. did not affect parasite growth in rich culture medium but completely attenuated infectivity in macrophages and in highly susceptible BALB/c mice (3Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The GDP-Man-negative mutant, GDPMP, was shown to be deficient in a range of cell surface and secreted mannose-containing molecules, including several abundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored glycoproteins, a major GPI-anchored lipophosphoglycan (LPG), a family of free GPI glycolipids (termed glycoinositol phospholipids (GIPLs)), and O-phosphoglycosylated secreted proteophosphoglycans (PPGs) that are thought to be important virulence factors (5Spath G.F.

Rev. 2002; 66: 122-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, other genetic studies suggested that the loss of virulence of the GDPMP parasites cannot be explained by the loss of these surface or secreted molecules. For example, L. mexicana mutants with defects in the biosynthesis of LPG, the secreted PPGs, or GPI-anchored glycoproteins were as virulent as wild type parasites (3Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 8Ilg T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1953-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 9Hilley J.D. Zawadzki J.L. McConville M.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4988-4997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas mutants with defects in the surface expression of all GPI-anchored molecules exhibited only a partial loss of virulence under the same experimental conditions (4Garami A. Mehlert A. Ilg T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8168-8183Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The surface expression of LPG and GPI-anchored glycoproteins is also naturally down-regulated following differentiation of promastigotes to amastigotes (11Winter G. Fuchs M. McConville M.J. Stierhof Y.D. Overath P. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2471-2482Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12McConville M.J. Blackwell J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15170-15179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), supporting the notion that these molecules are not essential for survival within macrophages. These genetic studies raise the possibility that mannose-containing molecules other than the major cell surface glycoconjugates are required for Leishmania infectivity. Studies by Blum and colleagues (13Keegan F.P. Blum J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Keegan F.P. Blum J.J. J. Eukaryot. Microbiol. 1993; 40: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) more than a decade ago showed that Leishmania donovani promastigotes synthesize a mannose-rich polysaccharide, termed mannan, although the precise structure of this material was not determined. In this study we show that L. mexicana mannan comprises a family of β1-2 mannan oligosaccharides that, in contrast to the major surface coat components, are expressed at much higher levels in pathogenic developmental stages than in non-pathogenic stages. We present evidence that these intracellular oligosaccharides are required for differentiation and may protect Leishmania from starvation and/or stress conditions encountered in the macrophage phagolysosome. Our results provide strong evidence that these intracellular oligosaccharides constitute a new class of virulence factor. Parasite Culture and Experimental Infection of Mice—Promastigotes of the L. mexicana WT strain MNYC/BZ/62/M379 and the L. mexicana glycosylation mutant DIG1 (15Naderer T. McConville M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) were grown in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (iFBS) at 27 °C. Cultures were harvested at day 1 or day 5 to obtain log phase (LP) or stationary phase (SP) promastigotes, respectively. The day 5 cultures contained ∼40% metacyclic promastigotes consistent with previous observations (16Mallinson D.J. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1989; 98: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The L. mexicana mutant, GDPMP, was routinely cultivated in semi-defined medium 79 supplemented with 4% iFBS (3Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mice were infected with either 5 × 106 SP or freshly isolated LA by subcutaneous injection near the tail. Extraction of Mannan—Promastigote and amastigote stages were extracted in CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O (1:2:0.8 v/v) at a density of 2-4 × 108 cells/ml (2 h at room temperature) with regular sonication and vortex mixing. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 5 min), and the supernatant was dried under N2 before being partitioned within a biphasic mixture of water (200 μl) and 1-butanol (400 μl) to separate the major class of glycolipids (upper organic phase) from the mannan (lower aqueous phase). The lower phase was subsequently desalted by passage down a small column (400 μl) of AG 50-X12 (H+) over AG 3-X8 (OH-) and freeze-dried to give a neutral non-lipidic (NNL) fraction. The delipidated pellet was further extracted with 9% 1-butanol (2-12 h at 4 °C with sonication and vortex mixing) to extract LPG and additional mannan. After centrifugation, the extract was freeze dried, suspended in 5% 1-propanol, 0.1 m NH4OAc, and loaded onto a small column of octyl-Sepharose (1 ml) equilibrated in the same buffer. Material eluted in the unbound fraction (4 ml) was desalted and combined with the NNL fraction, whereas LPG was eluted with 30% 1-propanol (4 ml) and freeze-dried prior to further analyses. HPLC, HPTLC, and Bio-Gel P-4 Chromatography—The NNL fraction was analyzed on a Dionex HPLC system equipped with an online pulsed amperometric detector and a CarboPac PA-100 column. Samples were loaded onto a column pre-equilibrated with 0.15 m NaOH, 7.5 mm NaOAc at a flow rate of 0.6 ml·min-1, then eluted with 2 linear gradients of NaOAc (7.5-175 mm from 1 to 60 min and 175-250 mm from 60 to 70 min) in 0.15 m NaOH. Glycans were detected with the pulsed amperometric detector and, if radiolabeled, by neutralizing an aliquot of each fraction with 1 m acetic acid and scintillation counting. The NNL fractions were also analyzed on Silica Gel 60 aluminum-backed HPTLC sheets (Merck), developed twice in 1-butanol:ethanol:water (4:3:3 v/v). Radiolabeled bands were detected with a Bertold LB 2821 automatic thin layer chromatography linear scanner or by fluorography after spraying HPTLC sheets with EN 3E. Saunders, J. Callaghan, and M. McConville, unpublished data.HANCE spray (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposing them to Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at -70 °C. High resolution gel filtration of the NNL fraction was performed on a column (2 × 100 cm) of Bio-Gel P-4 (200-400 medium) held at 55 °C and eluted with water at a flow rate of 12 ml h-1, and 1-ml fractions were collected. NNL fractions containing radiolabeled glycans were co-injected with a mixture of α1-6 glucose oligomers generated by partial acid hydrolysis of dextran (1 m trifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h) to define the degree of polymerization (dp) of each chain. Unlabeled mannan and dextran oligomers were detected using an online refractometer (Erna), whereas radiolabeled mannan was detected by scintillation counting. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS)—The monosaccharide composition of each subcellular fraction was determined after solvolysis in 0.5 m methanolic HCl (50 μl at 80 °C for 12 h), trimethylsilylation of the released monosaccharide methyl esters, and analysis of the trimethylsilylation derivatives by GC-MS (17McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ferguson M.A. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude and purified mannan fractions were permethylated, and the partially permethylated alditol acetates were analyzed by GC-MS as previously described (17McConville M.J. Thomas-Oates J.E. Ferguson M.A. Homans S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19611-19623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling—L. mexicana promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min) and resuspended in glucose-free RPMI medium containing 1% BSA (108 cells/ml) for 10 min at 27 °C. [2-3H]Man (50 μCi/ml) was added and cells were incubated for 5-10 min before being briefly pelleted in a microcentrifuge (15,000 × g for 20 s) and resuspended in various media (RPMI, RPMI minus glucose, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) containing 1% BSA. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and sequentially extracted in CHCl3: CH3OH:H2O (1:2:0.8 v/v) and 9% 1-butanol as described above. Subcellular Fractionation—L. mexicana LP and SP were harvested by centrifugation (800 × g for 10 min), washed twice in PBS, and hypotonically permeabilized under conditions known to preserve the latency of intracellular organelles (18Ralton J.E. Mullin K.A. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Permeabilized promastigotes were pelleted by centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the cell pellet (P1) was washed three times with 75 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.6. The cytoplasmic supernatant and P1 washes were centrifuged at 100,000 × g (for 30 min at 4 °C) to yield a cytosolic supernatant and a microsomal pellet (P2). The P1 and P2 fractions were suspended in 75 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, and all fractions were adjusted to contain 0.1% Triton X-100. The mannan content of each fraction was determined by GC-MS. Hexose kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were used as markers for the glycosome and cytosol, respectively (19Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Exp. Parasitol. 1985; 59: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hexose kinase was assayed in 75 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10 mm glucose, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm NAD, 1 mm ATP, and 2.5 μg of Leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma), whereas endogenous glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was assayed in 75 mm triethanolamine/HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.5 mm NADP. Enzyme reactions (1 ml) were carried out at 25 °C, and the rate of reduction of NAD+ or NADP+ was monitored at 340 nm. Growth Assays and Macrophage Infections—Wild type, DIG1, and GDPMP promastigotes were harvested, washed twice with PBS, then resuspended in PBS (1 × 107 cell/ml), and incubated at 27 °C for 20 h. Parasite viability was tested by harvesting cells and resuspending them in RPMI medium containing 10% iFBS. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points, parasites were harvested by centrifugation (15,000 × g for 1 min), washed twice with PBS, and solubilized by boiling in 1% SDS, and cellular protein was determined with the BCA assay (20Smith P.K.

Data shown are representative of three separate experiments. Promastigotes were induced to differentiate to amastigotes by suspension in RPMI medium, pH 5.5, containing 20% iFBS and incubation at 33 °C (21Bates P.A. Robertson L. Tetley L. Coombs G.H. Parasitology. 1992; 105: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In some experiments, promastigotes were subjected to heat shock (33 °C) alone without acidification of the medium. The growth of parasites grown under these conditions was monitored by measuring cellular protein. Cell viability was assessed after 48 h by resuspending parasites in fresh RPMI medium, pH 7.5, containing 10% iFBS at 27 °C and measuring cellular protein at the times indicated. SP were also induced to differentiate to amastigotes by adding the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor, GA (Sigma), to promastigote medium (1Wiesgigl M. Clos J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3307-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A concentration of 200 ng of GA/ml (from a 1 mg/ml Me2SO stock) was used, and aliquots were removed at the indicated times for microscopy and mannan analysis. For the in vitro macrophage infectivity experiments, J774A.1 macrophages (2 × 105) were grown on 10-mm coverslips in RPMI medium containing 10% iFBS, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °Cin5%CO2. Confluent macrophage cultures were overlaid with stationary phase L. mexicana promastigotes (2 × 106) and incubated for 4 h at 33 °C in 5% CO2. Coverslips were washed three times with RPMI medium to remove unattached parasites and then incubated in macrophage medium for 120 h. Infectivity was assessed by washing coverslips with PBS (three times) and fixing macrophages in methanol. After successive washes with PBS and 50 mm NH4Cl, cells were permeabilized with 0.05% saponin in PBS (5 min at 0 °C), and the nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (0.2 μg/ml) for 5 min. Cells were washed with PBS (three times), and the number of infected macrophages was determined using fluorescence microscopy. Man-containing Oligosaccharides Accumulate in Pathogenic Stages of Leishmania—Recent genetic studies in L. mexicana have suggested that mannose-containing molecules, other than the major cell surface components, are potential virulence factors (3Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We therefore determined the monosaccharide composition of different subcellular fractions obtained from wild type (WT) L. mexicana by sequential solvent extraction, 1-butanol/water partitioning, and octyl-Sepharose chromatography. In addition to fractions containing cell surface GIPLs and LPG, this fractionation procedure generated a NNL fraction. The major sugar in the NNL fraction was mannose, and subsequent analyses (see below) showed that this hexose was associated exclusively with a family of mannan oligosaccharides. The mannose content of the NNL fraction increased from 25 nmol of Man/108 cells in log phase promastigotes to ∼80 nmol of Man/108 cells and 325 nmol of Man/108 cells in stationary phase promastigotes and amastigotes derived from mouse lesions, respectively (Fig. 1, A-C). The cellular levels of GIPLs remained unchanged in LP and SP (∼ 10 nmol of hexose/108 cells) but increased 3-fold in LA (30 nmol of hexose/108 cells) (Fig. 1, A-C). In contrast, the cellular levels of LPG decreased from 16 nmol of hexose/108 cells in LP to 2 and <1 nmol of hexose/108 cells in SP and LA, respectively. Hexose levels in the final residue fraction, corresponding to insoluble glycoproteins and proteophosphoglycans, accounted for ∼5% of the total cellular carbohydrate in all developmental stages. Thus the NNL fraction comprised 25, 80, and 90% of the total carbohydrate content of LP, SP, and LA, respectively. To investigate whether the changes in the size of the steady-state pools of mannan, GIPL, and LPG were because of changes in the rate of synthesis of these molecules, each developmental stage (LP, SP, and LA) was pulse-labeled with [3H]Man for 10 min and fractionated as described above. Although the uptake of [3H]Man into all developmental stages was similar (∼550,000, 600,000, and 300,000 cpm/108 cells in LP, SP, and LA, respectively), the rate of [3H]Man incorporation into the GIPL, LPG, and NNL fractions varied markedly (Fig. 1, D-F). In rapidly dividing LP, ∼65% of the [3H]Man was incorporated into the GIPL and LPG fractions (Fig. 1D). However, in non-dividing SP and in LA, most of the label (80 and 95% of total label, respectively) was incorporated into the mannan fraction (Fig. 1, E and F). The low rate of synthesis of GIPL and LPG in SP most likely reflects a low requirement for new plasma membrane components in these non-dividing cells. LA also retain relatively large steady-state pools of GIPLs despite very low rates of synthesis, implying that LA in mature lesions are growing very slowly. The NNL Fraction Contains a Family of β1-2 Mannan Oligosaccharides—HPLC analysis of the NNL fraction revealed the presence of a heterogeneous population of oligosaccharides that were metabolically labeled with [3H]Man (Fig. 2A). Gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P-4 column (Fig. 2B) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 2J. Ralton, H. Piraino, and M. McConville, unpublished data. showed that these oligosaccharides comprised 4-40 hexose residues. Compositional and methylation-linkage analysis of Bio-Gel P-4 purified peaks indicated that each of these oligosaccharides contained only terminal or 2-O-substituted mannose (Table I). Mannitol was absent from the monosaccharide analysis unless the NNL fraction was reduced with NaBD4, indicating that all these oligosaccharides contain mannose at their reducing termini. The mannan oligosaccharides were resistant to prolonged digestion with jack bean α-mannosidase but were slowly hydrolyzed by snail β1-4-mannosidase with release of mannose (Fig. 2C). Further additions of β1-4-mannosidase increased the proportion of mannan digested, 2J. Ralton, H. Piraino, and M. McConville, unpublished data. suggesting that the incomplete digestion reflected the linkage specificity of this enzyme. Collectively these analyses suggest that Leishmania mannan comprises a family of linear β1-2-linked mannose oligosaccharides. Interestingly, promastigote mannan comprised chains up to 40 mannose residues long, whereas most of the LA mannan chains were between 4 and 10 residues long (Fig. 3).Table IMethylation linkage analysis and degree of polymerization of selected mannan oligomers The dp of different mannan oligomers was deduced by comparing their elution time on Bio-Gel P-4 with a series of coinjected dextran oligosaccharides. Methylation analysis revealed only 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-methyl-1,5-di-O-acetyl-mannitol and 3,4,6-tri-O-methyl-1,2,5-tri-O-acetyl-mannitol, corresponding to terminal (t-) and 2-linked (2-) Man in each peak.GUbRelative glucose unitsPeakaValues shown are molar ratiosdpt-Man2-Man3.61.02.144.51.02.855.21.03.466.01.04.776.71.06.187.71.07.59a Values shown are molar ratiosb Relative glucose units Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Mannan composition of different L. mexicana developmental stages and mannosylation mutants. The NNL fractions from different developmental stages of wild type L. mexicana (WT-LP, WT-SP, and WT-LA) as well as GDPMP-SP and DIG1-SP were analyzed by HPLC and detected using an amperometric detector. The dp of the major mannan oligomers in WT-SP, WT-LA, and DIG1-SP is indicated by the numbers above each peak. HPLC conditions were the same as described in the legend for Fig. 2A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The subcellular distribution of mannan was investigated by differential centrifugation of hypotonically lysed L. mexicana SP (18Ralton J.E. Mullin K.A. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Intracellular organelles such as glycosomes and endoplasmic reticulum retain their latency under these conditions, as shown by the recovery of the glycosomal marker, hexose kinase (Fig. 4) and the endoplasmic reticulum marker, binding protein (18Ralton J.E. Mullin K.A. McConville M.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), in the P1 and P2 fractions. In contrast, the cytosolic marker glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and mannan were largely recovered in the S1 cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4). Based on the mannan content of each developmental stage and estimates of cell volume (45 and 4 μm3 for promastigotes and amastigotes, respectively), the cytosolic concentration of mannan in LP, SP, and LA was estimated to be 0.5, 1.8, and 6.4 mm, respectively. Newly Synthesized Mannan Is Rapidly Catabolized under Starvation Conditions—To investigate whether mannan is a reserve material, WT-SP were pulse-labeled with [3H]Man and then resuspended in either RPMI plus 1% BSA with or without glucose or in PBS. Although [3H]mannan was slowly catabolized when promastigotes were suspended in glucose-containing medium, incubation in glucose-free medium or in PBS dramatically increased the turnover of [3H]Man label in the mannan fraction (Fig. 5, A and B). The [3H]Man label from the mannan fraction was not chased into the GIPLs (Fig. 5B), or other cellular fractions (data not shown), suggesting that the majority of the [3H]Man released from mannan was being converted to other hexoses with loss of the label as 3H2O. Similar results were observed when LA were metabolically labeled and chased under the same conditions (data not shown). Prolonged starvation of both SP and LA also resulted in a decrease in the total cellular pools of mannan detected by both GC-MS and HPLC analyses (data not shown), indicating that the turnover of the radiolabeled mannan reflected increased turnover of the total mannan pool and not just newly synthesized oligosaccharides. Mannan without Leishmania Are Unable to Tolerate Nutrient Starvation—The pulse-chase labeling studies suggested that mannan was a dynamic reserve material. We therefore investigated the capacity of LP and SP to recover after incubation in the absence of a carbon source for 20 h. L. mexicana LP, containing low levels of mannan, recovered slowly with a lag of 1-2 days after being resuspended in full medium (Fig. 6). In contrast, L. mexicana SP, containing high levels of mannan, recovered rapidly when transferred from the starve medium to complete medium (Fig. 6). We also tested the sensitivity of the L. mexicana GDPMP mutant to nutrient starvation. This mutant lacks the enzyme GDP-Man pyrophosphorylase, which catalyzes the synthesis of GDP-Man and is therefore deficient in all surface mannose-containing molecules (3Garami A. Ilg T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3657-3666Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), as well as detectable levels of mannan (Fig. 3). The GDPMP mutant was found to be extremely susceptible to starvation, with none of the cells surviving 20 h of incubation in PBS (Fig. 6). As the GDPMP promastigotes are deficient in all mannose-containing molecules, we also tested the sensitivity of a second L. mexicana mutant, termed DIG1, to starvation. This mutant synthesizes wild type levels of mannan (Fig. 3) but not the major surface components such as LPG, the secreted PPGs, GPI-anchored proteins, and polar GIPLs (15Naderer T. McConville M.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 125: 147-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). DIG1-SP rapidly recovered from starvation with the same kinetics as WT-SP (Fig. 6) suggesting that the sensitivity of the GDPMP mutant to starvation most likely reflects the absence of mannan in these cells. Mannan Accumulates in Response to Stress—Intracellular polysaccharides have been shown to confer resistance to stress in diverse eukaryotic systems (22Francois J. Parrou J.L. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 125-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Leishmania parasites are exposed to both elevated temperature and reduced pH when introduced into the mammalian host and internalized by macrophages, and these conditions have been shown to trigger differentiation of promastigotes to amastigotes in vitro (Fig. 7A). Incubation of WT-SP at 33 °C in RPMI medium induced a 25-fold increase in intracellular mannan levels (Fig. 7A). Heat shock, combined with acidification of the medium, also triggered the accumulation of mannan although to a lesser extent than heat shock alone (Fig. 7A). In contrast, mannan levels in cells incubated in RPMI medium, pH 7.5, at 27 °C did not increase over the same time period (Fig. 7A). Inhibitors of L. donovani heat shock protein 90, such as the drug geldanamycin (GA), also induce a heat shock response and the differentiation of promastigotes to axenic amastigotes (1Wiesgigl M.

https://openalex.org/W1977234970,"A large number of G protein-coupled receptors are palmitoylated on cysteine residues located in their carboxyl tail, but the general role of this post-translational modification remains poorly understood. Here we show that preventing palmitoylation of the V2 vasopressin receptor, by site-directed mutagenesis of cysteines 341 and 342, significantly delayed and decreased both agonist-promoted receptor endocytosis and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Pharmacological blockade of receptor endocytosis is without effect on the vasopressin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, excluding the possibility that the reduced kinase activation mediated by the palmitoylation-less mutant could result from altered receptor endocytosis. In contrast, two dominant negative mutants of β-arrestin which inhibit receptor endocytosis also attenuated vasopressin-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, suggesting that the scaffolding protein, β-arrestin, represents the common link among receptor palmitoylation, endocytosis, and kinase activation. Coimmunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments confirmed that inhibiting receptor palmitoylation considerably reduced the vasopressin-stimulated recruitment of β-arrestin to the receptor. Interestingly, the changes in β-arrestin recruitment kinetics were similar to those observed for vasopressin-stimulated receptor endocytosis and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. Taken together the results indicate that palmitoylation enhances the recruitment of β-arrestin to the activated V2 vasopressin receptor thus facilitating processes requiring the scaffolding action of β-arrestin.

Among the molecular mechanisms regulating G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; AVP, arginine vasopressin; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; BRET, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer; 2-BrP, 2-bromopalmitic acid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293 cells; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; P-ERK1/2, phosphorylated ERK1/2; V2R, V2 vasopressin receptor; wt, wild-type. function, post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and palmitoylation have been the subject of numerous studies. The role of phosphorylation in receptor desensitization is now well established (1Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation, GPCRs become phosphorylated by both second messenger-activated and GPCR kinases on serine and threonine residues located in the third intracellular loop and/or carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptors. These phosphorylation events prevent further G protein interaction through the involvement of β-arrestin proteins preferentially binding to receptors phosphorylated by GPCR kinases. In addition to promoting receptor/G protein uncoupling, the β-arrestins target such desensitized receptors to clathrin-coated pits for endocytosis by functioning as adaptor proteins that link the receptors to components of the endocytic machinery. Furthermore, β-arrestin acts as a scaffolding protein directly linking the receptors to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathways, a process that has been shown to play an important role in GPCR-mediated MAPK activation (2Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, GPCR palmitoylation has also been shown to affect receptor function, but its precise role is not well defined. This post-translational modification, resulting from the covalent linkage of palmitic acid through a thioester bond, usually occurs at the level of conserved cysteine residues in the carboxyl tail of receptors. GPCR palmitoylation has been found to affect differentially a broad spectrum of biological processes, including G protein coupling efficiency and selectivity, receptor phosphorylation and desensitization, receptor endocytosis, cell surface expression and trafficking, and receptor down-regulation (3Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Despite the role that β-arrestin plays in several of these processes, the influence of receptor palmitoylation on the recruitment of the scaffolding protein has never been investigated. For the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R), palmitoylation has been shown to occur on cysteine residues 341 and 342 in the carboxyl tail of the receptor (4Sadeghi H.M. Innamorati G. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In two studies, mutation of these palmitoylation sites had no effect on the arginine vasopressin (AVP) binding affinity or agonist-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (4Sadeghi H.M. Innamorati G. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Schülein R. Liebenhoff U. Muller H. Birnbaumer M. Rosenthal W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, no difference in agonist-promoted desensitization was observed between wild-type and the palmitoylation-less mutant V2R (4Sadeghi H.M. Innamorati G. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast, Schülein et al. (5Schülein R. Liebenhoff U. Muller H. Birnbaumer M. Rosenthal W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) also reported that lack of palmitoylation was associated with a reduced rate of agonist-promoted endocytosis. However, this finding was not confirmed by Sadeghi et al. (4Sadeghi H.M. Innamorati G. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), where wild-type V2R and two palmitoylation-less V2R mutants (C341G/C342G, C341S/C342S) were reported to have identical AVP-promoted endocytosis. Although stimulation of adenylyl cyclase through Gs is the best characterized signaling cascade engaged by the V2R, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) have also been shown to be activated upon activation of the V2R by its natural ligand, AVP (6Thibonnier M. Conarty D.M. Preston J.A. Wilkins P.L. Berti-Mattera L.N. Mattera R. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1998; 449: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Among diverse mechanisms, β-arrestin recruitment and receptor endocytosis have often been proposed to be implicated in the activation of these MAPKs by GPCR. Despite the growing recognition that activation of MAPK by GPCR plays important roles in downstream signaling events (7Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) and the putative role of palmitoylation in agonist-promoted endocytosis, very little is known of the potential role of receptor palmitoylation in MAPK activation. In the present study, we investigated the role of V2R palmitoylation on AVP-stimulated MAPK activation, receptor endocytosis, and β-arrestin recruitment. We report that the lack of palmitoylation at cysteines 341 and 342 significantly decreases the rate and extent of β-arrestin recruitment to the V2R, thus leading to slower and reduced receptor endocytosis and MAPK activation. Our results also indicate that although the scaffolding function of β-arrestin plays important roles in both AVP-stimulated endocytosis and MAPK activation, the latter can occur independently of receptor internalization. We thus suggest that V2R palmitoylation serves to induce and/or stabilize a particular receptor conformation, optimizing the interaction of β-arrestin with the receptor and facilitating β-arrestin-dependent downstream events such as ERK1/2 activation and endocytosis.

The myc epitope-tagged hV2R (mycV2R) was then subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector in which the cytomegalovirus promoter had been replaced by the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter. The V2R mutant lacking the palmitoylation sites cysteine 341 and cysteine 342 (C341A/C342A-V2R) was constructed by PCR site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteines into alanines using the wild-type pcDNA3-RSV-mycV2R.

The palmitoylation sites cysteine 341 and cysteine 342 were then replaced by alanine residues by PCR site-directed mutagenesis to generate the pcDNA3.1-C341A/C342A-V2R-GFP. β-Arrestin Constructs—For the β-arrestin-Rluc, the rat β-arrestin2 (arrestin3) coding sequence was inserted in-frame 5′ of the Renilla luciferase sequence in the pRluc vector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) so that a 7-amino acid linker (GAGALAT) separated the carboxyl terminus of β-arrestin and the initiator methionine of Rluc. For the β-arrestin-GFP, the rat β-arrestin2 coding sequence was subcloned in-frame 5′ of the GFP10 coding sequence within the pcDNA3.1-V2R-GFP (see above) after removing the V2R coding sequence. This led to a construct in which the carboxyl terminus of the β-arrestin was separated from the initiator methionine of GFP10 by a 6-amino acid linker (GSGTGS). β-Arrestin (319–418) and β-arrestin V53D (10Krupnick J.G.

Benovic (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, 0.1 unit/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml Fungizone. Stable transfections of myc-tagged wt- or C341A/C342A-V2R were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and neomycin-resistant cells were selected in the presence of 450 μg/ml G418. Resistant clones were screened for V2R expression by radioligand binding assay. In cases where receptors and accessory proteins needed to be overexpressed, transient transfections were made, and cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. In bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays, the calcium phosphate precipitation method (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.33-16.36Google Scholar) was used, whereas FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was utilized, according to the manufacturer's protocol, in all other cases. Radioligand binding assays were carried out in both whole cell and purified membrane preparations using [3H]AVP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as radioligand. In the case of membrane binding, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, lysed in 15 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, using a Polytron (three times for 5 s). The supernatant resulting from a 5-min 200 × g centrifugation was recentrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. The pelleted membranes were washed once in 50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, and a binding assay was carried out in the same buffer. 15 μg of membrane proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of increasing concentrations of [3H]AVP (0.1–40 nm) and 1 mg/ml BSA, in a total volume of 300 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm cold AVP. For whole cell binding, cells were detached from 100-mm dishes using 5mm EDTA in PBS. Cells (40 μg of cell proteins) were then resuspended in ice-cold PBS and the radioligand binding initiated by adding a saturating concentration of [3H]AVP (20 nm) in the presence or absence 10 μm cold AVP for 2 h at 4 °C. In both cases, the reaction was stopped by rapid filtration over glass fiber (GF/C) filters (Whatman) and bound radioligand detected by scintillation counting. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes, preincubated for 1 h in serum-free medium, and labeled with 0.4 mCi/ml [3H]palmitic acid for 2 h at 37 °C. Where indicated, cells were also pretreated for 16 h in the presence of 100 μm 2-bromopalmitic acid (2-BrP) (Fluka Chemie) or 4 h with 30 μm tunicamycin at 37 °C. After metabolic labeling, V2Rs were purified by immunoprecipitation using the AS435 antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal portion of the human V2R (peptide ARG29, ARGRTPPSLGPQDESCTTASSSLAKDTSS). The selectivity of the antibody was confirmed by the fact that a band was identified only in cells transfected with the V2R and that the myc-tagged V2R was recognized by both AS435 and the anti-myc 9E10 antibodies. Labeled cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed by sonication (twice for 15 s) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g and then 20 min at 40,000 × g at 4 °C. The recovered membranes were then washed once in the same buffer and solubilized in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, with protease inhibitors and N-ethylmaleimide) for 1 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation. The solution was then centrifuged 1 h at 145,000 × g at 4 °C to get rid of insoluble material, and the supernatant was preincubated with a suspension of Staphylococcus aureus (Pansorbin; Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C before incubation with 5 μl of AS435 antibody in the presence of 1% BSA for 16 h at 4 °C. Antigen-antibody complexes were then isolated by incubation with 40 μl of Pansorbin for 2 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 2 min. Precipitates were washed five times in RIPA buffer and proteins eluted in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, 4% SDS, 1 m urea, 5% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue). Proteins were then resolved on SDS-PAGE in nonreducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Tritium-labeled proteins were detected using EA-Wax (EABiotech Ltd., Interscience) and exposing the membranes to Kodak X-Omat film for 1 week. Detection of the receptors by immunoblots was performed using the anti-myc monoclonal 9E10 IgG as a primary antibody followed by an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Amersham Biosciences) for chemiluminescence detection. Cells were grown in 6-well plates and incubated in the presence of 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 16 h. They were then washed twice with PBS containing 1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine before being incubated in the presence of increasing concentration of AVP for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid and 1 mm unlabeled cAMP to decrease enzymatic degradation of [3H]cAMP. The cells were scraped off the plates and centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to clear the lysate. The [3H]cAMP was then separated by sequential chromatography over Dowex and Alumina columns as described previously (56Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The cAMP accumulation was calculated as ([3H]cAMP cpm/([3H]cAMP cpm + [3H]ATP cpm)) × 1,000 and expressed as a percentage of the maximal AVP-stimulated cAMP production for the wtV2R. Cells were grown in 6-well plates and rendered quiescent by serum starvation for 24 h prior to stimulation with 10% FBS or different concentrations of AVP for the indicated time. Cells were then placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and solubilized directly in 100 μlof Laemmli sample buffer containing 50 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were sonicated for 10 s, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and microcentrifuged 5 min before fractionation of the proteins on SDS-PAGE. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected by protein immunoblotting using P-ERK1/2-specific antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as secondary antibody for chemiluminescence detection. After quantification of phosphorylation by autoradiography, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped of immunoglobulins and reprobed using anti-ERK1/2. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was normalized according to the loading of proteins by expressing the data as a ratio of P-ERK1/2 over total ERK1/2. Receptor internalization was measured as described previously (12Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34616-34622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 24-well plates and washed twice with 0.2 m Hepes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to incubation with AVP for the indicated time. Stimulations were stopped on ice, and cells were washed twice with cold PBS and blocked for 30 min with 1% BSA in PBS before being incubated for 1 h with the anti-myc 9E10 antibody. Cells were then washed three times with 1% BSA in PBS and fixed for 15 min at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. They were then washed twice with PBS, reblocked for 15 min, and incubated with an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase antibody. Antibody binding was then visualized after three additional washes by adding 0.5 ml of OPD peroxidase substrate diluted in PBS. Reactions were stopped by adding 0.1 ml of 3 n HCl, and the absorbance of the samples was read at 492 nm in a spectrophotometer. The BRET between the V2R-GFP and β-arrestin2-Rluc was measured as described previously (13Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 48 h post-transfection, cells were detached and washed twice with PBS at room temperature. Cells (40 μg of proteins) were then distributed in a 96-well microplate (white Optiplate from Packard Bioscience) and incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm AVP for the indicated time. DeepBlueC™ coelanterazine (Packard Bioscience) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected using a modified top count apparatus (BRETCount) that allows the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 370–450 and 500–530 nm windows using filters with the appropriate band pass (Chroma). The BRET signal was determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the receptor-GFP (500–530 nm) to the light emitted by the β-arrestin2-Rluc (370–450 nm). The values were corrected by subtracting the background signal detected when the β-arrestin2-Rluc construct was expressed alone. Where indicated, cells were pretreated for 16 h in the presence of 100 μm 2-BrP or 4 h with 30 μm tunicamycin at 37 °C before being detached. Coimmunoprecipitation of covalently cross-linked β-arrestin to V2Rs was performed as described previously (14Tohgo A. Choy E.W. Gesty-Palmer D. Pierce K.L. Laporte S. Oakley R.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6258-6267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with β-arrestin2-GFP and myc-tagged wt- or C341A/C342A-V2R. 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with or without 1 μm AVP in PBS for 15 min at 37 °C, and stimulations were terminated by the addition of the membrane-permeable and reversible cross-linking agent DSP at a final concentration of 2 mm. Cells were then incubated for 30 min at room temperature under gentle agitation; washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 in PBS to neutralize unreacted DSP; lysed in 0.5 ml of 50 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and N-ethylmaleimide; and clarified by centrifugation. 25-μl aliquots of whole cell lysate was removed and mixed with an equal volume of 2× reducing loading buffer (with dithiothreitol at a final concentration of 50 mm). To isolate V2R-bound β-arrestin2-GFP, BSA was added to each lysate to a final concentration of 1%, and immunoprecipitation was performed for 16 h at 4 °C using the anti-myc monoclonal 9E10 antibody precoated on protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immune complexes were washed three times with glycerol lysis buffer and eluted in 1× reducing loading buffer 15 min at 45 °C. Proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. Immunoblotting of β-arrestin2-GFP was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP IgG (Clontech), and immunoblotting of mycV2Rs was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-myc A14 IgG. Immune complexes were then visualized by chemiluminescence detection using anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes, preincubated for 1 h in 0.2 m Hepes in phosphate-free medium, and labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml 32Pi for 2 h at 37 °C with or without 1 μm AVP for the last 15 min. Labeled cells were washed twice with cold PBS and incubated in RIPA buffer for 1 h under gentle agitation. The solution was then centrifuged for 1 h at 145,000 × g at 4 °C to get rid of insoluble material, and the V2Rs were purified by overnight immunoprecipitation at 4 °C using the anti-myc monoclonal 9E10 antibody precoated on protein G-Sepharose beads. Immune complexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer and eluted in 1× loading buffer 15 min at 45 °C. Proteins were then resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes where 32P-labeled proteins were detected using the Molecular Imager® FX PhosphorImager (Bio-Rad). Detection of the receptors by immunoblots was performed using rabbit polyclonal anti-myc A14 IgG. Immune complexes were then visualized by chemiluminescence detection using anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG. Protein concentrations were determined using either the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay or the Bradford quantification assay using BSA as standard. Dose-response curves and saturation experiments were analyzed by nonlinear regression using Prism (GraphPad Software), and the EC50 values were derived from the curves. Affinity constant (Kd) and maximal binding (B max) values of the radioligand were derived from the curve fitting. Immunoreactivities were determined by densitometric analysis of the films using NIH Image software. The extent of receptor phosphorylation was determined by digital analysis of the images generated by the PhosphorImager using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The MAPK activation, internalization, and β-arrestin recruitment rates were evaluated by analyzing the linear portion of the curves with the following rate equation q(t)=q(t→∞)+q(t=0)e(-R)t(Eq. 1) where t is the time of incubation (in min), R is the rate, and q represents the level of MAPK activation, internalized receptors, or β-arrestin recruitment. The data in the initial part of the curves were plotted as in Equation 2. f(t)=ln(q(t)/q(0))(Eq. 2) The half-times were estimated as t where q(t) = 50% of the maximal effect in each data set. Statistical significances of the differences were carried out using unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Expression and Palmitoylation State of Wild-type and Mutant V2Rs—To study the role of palmitoylation of the V2Rs, HEK293 cells were stably transfected with myc-tagged wtV2Rs or mutant receptors in which the potential palmitoylation sites (cysteines 341 and 342) were replaced by alanines (C341A/C342A-V2R). Clonal cell lines expressing similar and physiological levels (wtV2R, 350 ± 20 fmol/mg; C341A/C342A, 290 ± 20 fmol/mg) of V2Rs as determined by [3H]AVP binding were selected and used in the various assays. Saturation binding experiments performed on isolated membranes of these clones confirmed, as reported previously (5Schülein R. Liebenhoff U. Muller H. Birnbaumer M. Rosenthal W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), that the replacement of cysteines 341 and 342 by alanines does not affect the affinity of the receptor for AVP (Kd = wtV2R, 0.8 ± 0.1 nm versus C341A/C342A, 0.7 ± 0.1 nm). The palmitoylation state of the V2Rs was then verified by metabolic labeling of the cells with [3H]palmitic acid followed by immunoprecipitation of the receptors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 shows that mutation of cysteines 341 and 342 in the V2R greatly reduced the level of tritium incorporation in the receptor, confirming that these cysteines represent the major palmitoylation sites (4Sadeghi H.M. Innamorati G. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Role of V2R Palmitoylation in Intracellular Signaling—To assess the importance of palmitoylation in receptor signaling, we investigated the effect of mutating cysteines 341 and 342 on the ability of the V2R to activate adenylyl cyclase and MAPK pathways. As reported previously (4Sadeghi H.M. Innamorati G. Dagarag M. Birnbaumer M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 52: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 5Schülein R. Liebenhoff U. Muller H. Birnbaumer M. Rosenthal W. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), replacing cysteines 341 and 342 with alanine residues did not affect AVP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Indeed, neither the efficacy nor the potency of AVP for this signaling pathway was affected by the mutation in HEK293 cells stably expressing comparable amounts of receptors (Fig. 2). In contrast, significant differences in the pattern of the ERK1/2 MAPK stimulation were observed between wt- and C341A/C342A-V2R (Fig. 3). Although an AVP-mediated increase in ERK1/2 activity was observed with both receptors, as assessed by immunoblotting using phospho-specific ERK1/2 antibodies, a delayed and reduced activation was found for the palmitoylation-less mutant (Fig. 3A). However, AVP was found to promote a more sustained ERK1/2 activation through the C341A/C342A-V2R. Quantitative assessment of these differences using total ERK1/2 immunoreactivity to normalize the phosphorylation levels is shown in Fig. 3B. The maximal level of wtV2R-mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was reached as early as 2 min after the addition of AVP and returned to basal level after 10 min, whereas the C341A/C342A-V2R-mediated phosphorylation of the kinases peaked after ∼4 min and only returned to basal level after 20 min. Kinetic analysis of the initial ERK1/2 activation curves revealed a significant"
https://openalex.org/W1981021739,"The Rho family of small GTPases regulates numerous signaling pathways that control the organization of the cytoskeleton, transcription factor activity, and many aspects of the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts. We now demonstrate that the kinase Mirk (minibrain-related kinase)/dyrk1B is induced by members of the Rho-family in myoblasts and that Mirk is active in skeletal muscle differentiation. Mirk is an arginine-directed serine/threonine kinase which is expressed at elevated levels in skeletal muscle compared with other normal tissues. A Mirk promoter construct was activated when C2C12 myoblasts were switched from growth to differentiation medium and was also activated by the Rho family members RhoA, Cdc42, and to a lesser degree Rac1, but not by MyoD or Myf5. Mirk protein levels increased following transient expression of constitutively active Cdc42-QL, RhoA-QL, or Rac1-QL in C2C12 cells. High concentrations of serum mitogens down-regulated Mirk through activation of the Ras-MEK-Erk pathway. As a result, Mirk transcription was induced by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 and by the switch from growth to differentiation medium. Mirk was induced with similar kinetics to another Rho-induced differentiation gene, myogenin. Mirk protein levels increased 10-fold within 24–48 h after primary cultured muscle cells; C2C12 mouse myoblasts or L6 rat myoblasts were induced to differentiate. Thus Mirk was induced following the commitment stage of myogenesis. Stable overexpression of Mirk enabled myoblasts to fuse more rapidly when placed in differentiation medium. The function of Mirk in muscle differentiation was established by depletion of endogenous Mirk by small interfering RNA, which prevented myoblast fusion into myotubes and inhibited induction of markers of differentiation, including myogenin, fast twitch troponin T, and muscle myosin heavy chain. Other members of the dyrk/minibrain/HIPK family of kinases in lower organisms have been shown to regulate the transition from growth to differentiation, and Mirk is now shown to participate in skeletal muscle development.

The Rho family of evolutionarily conserved small GTPases regulates numerous signaling pathways that control the organization of the cytoskeleton and influence cell polarity, microtubule dynamics, membrane transport, and transcription factor activity (1Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3858) Google Scholar). Rho family members have been implicated in many aspects of the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts. Rho-GTP levels have been observed to increase during myogenic differentiation, while inhibition of Rho blocks myogenesis (2Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. J.

Rho GTPase activity was shown to regulate an adipogenesis-myogenesis decision in vivo in response to IGF-1, using mice lacking the major Rho inhibitory protein p190-B RhoGAP (5Sordella R. Jiang W. Chen G. Curto M. Settleman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking p190-B RhoGAP underwent the “default pathway” of myogenic differentiation in response to IGF-1 unless the Rho effector Rho-kinase was inhibited (5Sordella R. Jiang W. Chen G. Curto M. Settleman J. Cell. 2003; 113: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Conversely, IGF-1, together with oncogenically activated RhoV14, stimulated myogenic differentiation in wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts. In the current study, we have established that the Mirk (minibrain-related kinase) gene (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar) is induced by certain Rho family members and furthermore that Mirk functions in myogenesis. Mirk is a member of the dyrk/minibrain family of arginine-directed serine/threonine protein kinases (7Kentrup H. Becker W. Heukelbach J. Wilmes A. Schurman A. Huppertz C. Kainulainen H. Joost H.-G.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The roles of dyrk/minibrain/Mirk homologues in yeast (Yak1) and slime mold (YakA) suggest that this group of kinases regulates the transition from growth to differentiation (11Moriya H. Shimizu-Yoshida Y. Omori A. Iwashita S. Katoh M. Sakai A. Genes Dev. 2001; 150: 1217-1228Crossref Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 12Taminato A. Bagattini R. Gorjao R. Chen G. Kuspa A. Souza G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2266-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). During Dictyostelium growth, YakA regulates the intervals between cell division. Following nutrient depletion, YakA mediates growth arrest and an increase in protein kinase A activity, which regulates expression of adenyl cyclase and ultimately the induction of development. We have found a similar function for Mirk in myogenesis. Mirk is dramatically up-regulated when myoblasts are induced to differentiate, while depletion of endogenous Mirk by RNAi blocks myotube formation. Mirk/dyrk1B functions as a transcription factor activator for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 in endodermally derived tissues (13Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mirk is likely to fulfull a similar role in muscle differentiation, although the transcription factor which Mirk activates in myotubes is not yet known. Mirk itself is activated by coexpressed MKK3 (13Lim S. Jin K. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25040-25046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), a MAP kinase kinase that can also activate p38 MAP kinase (14Lin A. Minden A. Martinetto H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 49438-49445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since p38 has also been shown to be required for terminal muscle cell differentiation (18Cabane C. Englaro W. Yeow K. Ragno M. Derijard B. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C658-C666Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), p38 and Mirk may mediate different steps in maturation, with p38 suppressing Mirk activity. Our data in the current study demonstrate that the serine/threonine kinase Mirk/dyrk1B is active in muscle differentiation and is induced by Rho family members and by blocking the MEK1/Erk pathway. Materials—Antibodies to myogenin, MyoD, troponin T, β-tubulin, and p21cip1 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to a unique sequence at the C terminus of Mirk was raised as described previously (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). The MF 20 monoclonal antibody to MHC developed by D. A. Fischman was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and maintained by the University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. Polyvinylidene difluoride transfer paper Immobolin-P was purchased from Millipore. PLUS reagent and LipofectAMINE were from Invitrogen; all radioactive materials were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, ECL reagents from Amersham Biosciences, and tissue culture reagents from Mediatech (Fisher). All other reagents were from Sigma. Tissue from human skeletal muscle biopsies was kept in liquid N2 until use. The frozen tissue was ground with a mortar and pestle, suspended in boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer, further homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, centrifuged to remove insoluble material, and size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE. Cell Culture—C2C12 mouse myoblasts were obtained from the ATCC and L6E9 rat myoblasts were a gift of S. M. Rosenthal (University of California San Francisco). Cells were maintained in growth medium (GM; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum) and switched to differentiation medium (DM; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% horse serum). Primary cultures of murine myoblasts were prepared from hindlimb muscles of adult mice by enzymatic dissociation using collagenase D and dispase (Roche Applied Science). The myoblasts were maintained in dishes coated with Vitrogen collagen (Cohesion Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) in growth medium for primaries (GMP; Ham's F-10 containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 10 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor from Promega). For studies on differentiation, the cells were plated in GMP on dishes coated with E-C-L (entactin-collagen IV-laminin) cell attachment matrix (Upstate Biotechnology). After 24 h the GMP was replaced with differentiation medium for primaries (DMP; Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% horse serum). U9 colon carcinoma cells were maintained as described previously (19Yan Z. Kim G.-Y. Deng X. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9870-9879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plasmids—pHX9F (Mirk) and pHX9F (kinase inactive YF Mirk) had been previously generated (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar), as were the Mirk deletion mutants. 2X. Deng, S. Shah, S. Mercer, and E. Friedman, submitted for publication. Mirk was excised from pG9R containing the entire coding domain of Mirk/dyrk1B (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar) by EcoRI digestion and ligated into pLXSN (Clontech) and transfected into PT67 retrovirus packaging cells, and the recombinant virus was harvested from the supernatant. Stable Mirk transfectants of C2C12 cells were isolated following retroviral infection with pLXSN and isolation in G418. Constitutively active Cdc42-QL, Rac1-QL, and RhoA-QL were obtained from S. Gutkind, National Institutes of Health; MyoD was obtained from E. Olsen, University of Texas at Dallas; Myf5 was obtained from B. Winter, Universitat Braunschweig; and C3 was obtained from H. Moses, Vanderbilt Medical Center. Small Interfering RNA (RNAi) to Mirk—A sequence within the murine Mirk coding domain, GACCTACAAGCACATCATT, was cloned into the pSilencer vector. C2C12 cells were transfected with a 10 to 1 ratio (μg/μg) of RNAi plasmid to EGFP selection plasmid in serum-free medium and then isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting for EGFP. Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were transfected in 12-well plates for 6 h with LipofectAmine/PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's manual. Transfected cells were lysed with cell culture lysis reagent and assayed for luciferase activity (relative luciferase unit) with luciferase assay reagent (Promega) in a Turner Designs luminometer. The same lysates were diluted and assayed for β-galactosidase activity to normalize for transfection efficiency. Data shown are the mean of triplicate measurements. Mirk Promoter Constructs—Starting with a PAC clone that hybridized with Mirk cDNA, a BsrFI fragment that contained 67 bp of Mirk exon I from the transcription start site of the Mirk/dyrk1B gene (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar, 10Leder S. Weber Y. Altafaj X. Estivill X. Joost H.-G. Becker W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and the 6.2-kb upstream sequence, was blunt-ended with Klenow and subcloned into the HincII site of pUC19. Deletion derivatives were generated after cutting with XbaI and unique restriction enzymes in the promoter sequence, blunt-ended, and self-ligated. The Mirk promoter constructs were excised with KpnI from pUC19 and HindIII and subcloned into a luciferase reporter pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). The 6.2-kb promoter sequence linked to the luciferase reporter was named pMp-luc. pUCMpΔXE47 contains a 364-bp Eco47III-BsrFI fragment of the Mirk promoter, which includes 67 bp of Mirk exon I from the transcription start site of the Mirk/dyrk1B gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with mutagenic oligonucleotides using the pGEM-11Zf(+) vector (Promega) to transform BMH 71-18 mutS competent cells, and the products were sequenced to verify the mutation. Northern Analysis for Mirk mRNA—Total RNA was prepared by the Tri-Reagent protocol (Sigma). 20 μg of total RNA from each cell lysate was electrophoresed in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes by downward capillary transfer, and UV cross-linked. The membranes were hybridized to either 32P-labeled 2.2-kb Mirk cDNA or a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probe. Probes were labeled with 32P by random priming (Promega). The blot was hybridized overnight at 65 °C with at least 107 cpm of the labeled probe, washed at room temperature three times for 7 min with 1 × SSC, 1% SDS, washed for 20 min at 68° in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and autoradiographed. Immunodetection—Following treatment as indicated and washing two times with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in boiling SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol). Lysates were boiled again for 5 min and vortexed vigorously. Protein determinations were made using Coomassie Blue protein assay reagent from Pierce. Depending upon the experiment, 30–50 μg of cell lysates were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation on SDS-PAGE. The blots were blocked in 5% milk in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated for1hat room temperature with primary antibody in TBST buffer, 3% milk, and proteins were subsequently detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Band Analysis—Immunoblots were scanned using a Lacie Silver-scanner and densitometry performed using the IP Lab Gel program (Scanalytics). Mirk/dyrk1B Is Found in Elevated Levels in Normal Adult Skeletal Muscle and Is Induced during Differentiation of Primary Cultured Myoblasts—Our earlier Northern analysis demonstrated that Mirk mRNA expression levels are highest in skeletal muscle and testes, with much lower expression in heart, brain, colon, lung, and other tissues (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Serial analysis of gene expression analysis of Mirk mRNA levels confirmed that Mirk mRNA was about four times as prevalent in skeletal muscle from either young or old individuals compared with a variety of normal tissues, including kidney, brain, and breast (Fig. 1A). Consistent with the mRNA data, Mirk protein was detected by Western blotting in surgical samples of human skeletal muscle from five patients (H1–H5). Mirk encodes a protein of 629 amino acids and a smaller splice variant of 601 amino acids, which migrate at ∼70 and 69 kDa, respectively (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Recently a 75-kDa form arising from alternative splicing of the N terminus was identified in skeletal muscle and in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (21Leder S. Czajkowska H. Maenz B. de Graaf K. Barthel A. Joost H.-G. Becker W. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 881-888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Mirk splice variants found in each muscle tissue exhibit approximate molecular weights of 70 and 75 kDa (Fig. 1B, arrows at left). The two smaller Mirk/dyrk1B forms were seen in C2C12 cells in growth medium, while all three splice variants were detected in C2C12 cells cultured for 3 days in differentiation medium. Therefore, the induction of Mirk during C2C12 myoblast differentiation and the maintenance of elevated levels of the larger Mirk isoforms in adult human skeletal muscle suggest that Mirk may mediate muscle maturation and function. We did not wish to rely solely on immortalized cell lines to confirm that Mirk was induced during skeletal muscle differentiation. Murine muscle cells were placed into primary culture in growth medium (GMP), then induced to mature by culture in differentiation medium (DMP). As shown by Western blotting, Mirk levels increased about 10-fold after 1–2 days in DMP, with similar kinetics to myogenin, another gene known to function during skeletal muscle differentiation (Fig. 1C). Two forms of a late maturation marker, fast twitch troponin T (22Mullen A. Barton P. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), were induced with a later time course than Mirk. In contrast, elevated levels of MyoD and p21 were expressed before Mirk was induced. Therefore, Mirk induction was seen during differentiation of primary cultured muscle cells, as well as in the established C2C12 cell line, and induction of Mirk and myogenin occurred with similar kinetics. The Rho Family of GTPases Induces Mirk Expression—The Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 differentially regulate skeletal muscle cell differentiation. RhoA and serum response factor function together to induce MyoD (3Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzmann M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, while expression of exogenous Rac1 and Cdc42 can activate promoter constructs of certain muscle-specific genes (4Takano H. Komuro I. Oka T. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Mizuno T. Yazaki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1580-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), they also activate the kinases JNK and p38MAPK, which, respectively, inhibit and enhance myogenesis (23Meriane M. Roux P. Primig M. Fort P. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2513-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Precise temporal regulation of these Rho GTPases and the kinases that they activate must occur during myogenesis. We tested the ability of Rho GTPases to activate the Mirk promoter after first defining the minimal Mirk promoter. A 6.2-kb pMp-luc Mirk promoter construct was fused to a luciferase reporter gene. Assessment of the reporter activity of several deletion mutants revealed that activity was lost when the deletion creating the 111-bp construct removed the putative CAAT box. Thus the 364-bp pΔXE47-luc Mirk promoter construct contains the minimal promoter region (Fig. 2A). After transient transfection into C2C12 cells, this reporter construct was activated when cells were placed into differentiation medium and exhibited increased activity with time in DM (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the Mirk promoter reporter construct is activated by transcription factors active in differentiating C2C12 cells. The vertebrate muscle maturation program is controlled by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family, which acts in a sequential fashion. Two of these bHLH transcription factors, MyoD and Myf5, are expressed in proliferating undifferentiated myoblasts and upon growth factor withdrawal are activated to initiate myoblast maturation and fusion into myotubes. RhoA together with serum response factor activates MyoD (3Carnac G. Primig M. Kitzmann M. Chafey P. Tuil D. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1891-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), so we next tested the activity of Rho family members on the Mirk promoter construct in differentiating C2C12 cells. Co-expression of the Mirk reporter construct with the constitutively active constructs RhoA-QL or Cdc42-QL induced an 8-fold increase in reporter activity, while co-expression with constitutively active Rac1-QL led to a smaller 4-fold increase (Fig. 2C). Thus, each of these Rho GTPases activated the Mirk promoter construct in C2C12 cells. The activity of the Mirk promoter construct was increased more each day in DM (0–2 days) by co-transfected constitutively activated RhoA-QL (Fig. 2D). After 2 days in DM, Mirk induction by endogenous RhoA was inhibited 20% by co-transfected dominant negative RhoA-N19, and 40% by the exoenzyme C3 transferase (Fig. 2D). C3 inactivates RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC proteins but not Cdc42 or Rac. Therefore, RhoA induced Mirk expression, while dominant negative RhoA and the RhoA inhibitor C3 inhibited Mirk expression. To confirm that Rho family members induced endogenous Mirk expression, constitutively active Cdc42-QL, Rac1-QL, and RhoA-QL were transiently expressed in C2C12 cells. Even though the transfection efficiencies were on average about 30%, an increase in Mirk protein over control levels was seen after 2 days of expression in DM. Compared with cells transfected with vector DNA, the Mirk to tubulin ratio increased about 1.7–2.3-fold in cells expressing activated Cdc42, Rac1, or RhoA (Fig. 2E), which translates into 6-fold increases when the efficiency of transfection is factored in. Transient expression of the Rho inhibitor C3 transferase inhibited endogenous Mirk expression (Western blotting data not shown). Thus, the Rho family members RhoA, Cdc42, and to a lesser extent Rac1, induced Mirk during C2C12 cell maturation. Muscle-restricted basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors such as MyoD form heterodimers with other ubiquitous helix-loop-helix factors and bind to DNA elements called E boxes, which are found in the promoter regions of genes expressed in muscle. Two putative E boxes (CACGTG) were found in the pΔXE47 Mirk promoter construct at bp +12 (E1) and bp –245 (E2) from the Mirk/dyrk1B start site. Mutation of E1 did not alter basal transcription activity (data not shown), whereas mutation of E2 alone or both E2 and E1 resulted in a 3–4-fold decrease in basal transcription of the pΔXE47 Mirk promoter after 1–2 days in DM (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the Mirk promoter reporter construct is activated by transcription factors active in differentiating C2C12 cells, and moreover, mutation of the E2 E box blocks this response. Since putative E boxes were present in the mirk promoter, we next tested transcription factors that might bind to these promoter elements. MyoD binds to an E box element in the myogenin promoter and induces its transcription (24Edmondson D.G. Cheng C.T. Cserjesi P. Chakraborty T. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3665-3677Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). However, co-transfection with expression plasmids for either MyoD, Myf5, or the E box-binding protein E47 (25Murre C. McCaw P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1860) Google Scholar). had no effect on Mirk promoter construct activity (Fig. 2C). Co-expression of MyoD and E47 were likewise ineffective (not shown). Mirk Expression Increased following Inhibition of MEK—We next considered the possibility that, in addition to up-regulation by Rho-mediated differentiation signals, Mirk transcription might be blocked by growth signals. Growth medium contains high levels of serum mitogens including IGFs, which activate the Ras-MEK-Erk system leading to cell proliferation. Switching colon carcinoma cells to serum-free medium had caused a marked increase in Mirk protein levels in earlier studies (6Lee K. Deng X. Friedman E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3631-3637PubMed Google Scholar). Myoblasts responded in a similar fashion. Mirk protein levels increased 10-fold (Fig. 1, B and C), and the Mirk promoter construct (Fig. 2) was activated when myoblasts were transferred from high serum GM to low serum DM. While Erks can transactivate several nuclear transcription factors by phosphorylation, there are also a number of examples of Erk-mediated transcriptional down-regulation (26Neufeld B. Grosse-Wilde A. Hoffmeyer A. Jordan B. Chen P. Dinev D. Ludwig S. Rapp U. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20239-20242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Because of these observations, the hypothesis that the MEK1-Erk pathway could inhibit Mirk transcription was tested. The Mirk minimal promoter construct pΔXE47-luc was activated 6-fold when C2C12 cells were treated with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 3A). A similar 6-fold activation of the E box mutant promoter was induced by PD98059 treatment, confirming that this transcriptional down-regulation was not mediated through E box elements. The MEK1 signaling pathway also blocked Mirk transcription in colon carcinoma cells, showing the generality of this response. Both the Mirk minimal promoter and the longer 6.2-kb putative promoter construct were activated by treatment of U9 colon carcinoma cells with increasing concentrations of the MEK1 inhibitor (Fig. 3B). Northern analysis confirmed the reporter assay findings. Treatment with the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 increased Mirk mRNA levels 6-fold (Fig. 3, C and D, upper panel), and a parallel increase in Mirk protein level was observed (Fig. 3, C and D, lower panel). The induction of Mirk mRNA by serum-free culture was increased by concurrent treatment with cyclo-heximide to block protein translation (data not shown). Therefore, Mirk expression was negatively controlled on the transcriptional level by the Ras-Erk pathway, and protein synthesis was required to block Mirk transcription. Erk activation temporally preceded Mirk down-regulation in U9 colon carcinoma cells deprived of serum for 16 h, then released into medium containing fetal bovine serum. Serum caused a slow onset of Erk activation 3–6 h after addition, which persisted for several hours in these colon carcinoma cells, leading to a decrease in Mirk protein levels after 21–24 h (Fig. 3R). These data together show that blocking the MEK-Erk pathway increases Mirk abundance by up-regulating Mirk transcription. Time Course of Mirk Induction during Myoblast Differentiation—The time course for Mirk induction in two models of myoblast differentiation, rat L6E9 cells and mouse C2C12 cells, was determined as a first step in studying the biological effects of up-regulating or down-regulating Mirk levels. Cell lysates were examined for expression of Mirk and other markers of muscle cell differentiation by Western blotting for 0–4 days after switching the cells from growth m"

These features are critical for normal cardiac repolarization as well as in preventing lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Mutagenesis studies have shown that the extracellular peptide linker joining the fifth transmembrane domain to the pore helix is critical for rapid inactivation of the HERG K+ channel. This peptide linker is also considerably longer in HERG K+ channels, 40 amino acids, than in most other voltage-gated K+ channels. In this study we show that a synthetic 42-residue peptide corresponding to this linker region of the HERG K+ channel does not have defined structural elements in aqueous solution; however, it displays two well defined helical regions when in the presence of SDS micelles. The helices correspond to Trp585–Ile593 and Gly604–Tyr611 of the channel. The Trp585–Ile593 helix has distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. The Gly604–Tyr611 helix corresponds to an N-terminal extension of the pore helix. Electrophysiological studies of HERG currents following application of exogenous S5P peptides show that the amphipathic helix in the S5P linker interacts with the pore region of the channel in a voltage-dependent manner.

HERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) encodes the pore-forming α-subunit of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium channel, IKr (1Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). The channel is an important contributor to repolarization of the cardiac action potential (1Sanguinetti M.C.

Furthermore, mutations in HERG cause congenital long QT syndrome type 2 (4Curran M.E. Splawski I. Timothy K.W. Vincent G.M. Green E.D. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 80: 795-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar), which results in a markedly increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (5Chiang C.E.

A wide range of drugs that block the HERG K+ channel also result in drug-induced long QT syndrome, the most common cause of serious drug-induced arrhythmia and death (7Haverkamp W. Breithardt G. Camm A.J. Janse M.J. Rosen M.R. Antzelevitch C. Escande D. Franz M. Malik M. Moss A. Shah R. Eur. Heart J. 2000; 21: 1216-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 8Vandenberg J. Walker B.

Therefore, there is considerable interest in gaining a better understanding of the structure and structure-function relationships in the HERG K+ channel. HERG is a member of the family of voltage-gated K+ channels (VGK) 1The abbreviations used are: VGK, voltage-gated K+ channel; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary.1The abbreviations used are: VGK, voltage-gated K+ channel; NMDG, N-methyl-d-glucamine; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. that contain six transmembrane domains, denoted by S1–S6, and a pore helix that is interposed between S5 and S6. The positively charged S4 acts as the voltage sensor for activation (9Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Unlike other members of the VGK family, the HERG channel also undergoes very rapid voltage-dependent inactivation and recovery from inactivation (1Sanguinetti M.C. Jiang C. Curran M.E. Keating M.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 299-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar, 10Spector P.S. Curran M.E. Zou A. Keating M.T. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen.

Heinemann S.H. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 493: 635-642Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Consequently the HERG K+ channel functions as an inward rectifier, i.e. it passes little current at depolarized potentials but large currents during the terminal repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential (13Hancox J.C. Levi A.J. Witchel H.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 14Zhou Z. Gong Q. Ye B. Fan Z. Makielski J.C. Robertson G.A. January C.T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 230-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). This rapid inactivation is also critical for the role of the channel in suppressing arrhythmias initiated by ectopic electrical excitation (11Smith P.L. Baukrowitz T. Yellen G. Nature. 1996; 379: 833-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 15Lu Y. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Varghese A. Huang C.L. Kemp P.R. Vandenberg J.I. J. Physiol.

Biophys. 1998; 31: 239-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The pore region of HERG, including the pore helix, a selectivity filter, and S6, is highly homologous to that of other members of the VGK family (8Vandenberg J. Walker B. Campbell T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 240-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 9Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the extracellular loop connecting the pore helix to the top of S5 (S5P loop) in HERG is very different from that in other VGK family members. First, the S5P loop in HERG is about 40 amino acids long, compared with 10–15 in most other members of the VGK family (9Warmke J.W. Ganetzky B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3438-3442Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 23Pardo-Lopez L. Zhang M. Liu J. Jiang M. Possani L.D. Tseng G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16403-16411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (also see Fig. 1). Second, many mutations in the S5P loop disrupt the inactivation process in HERG (19Liu J. Zhang M. Jiang M. Tseng G.N. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 723-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Pardo-Lopez L. Zhang M. Liu J. Jiang M. Possani L.D. Tseng G.N. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 439: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Third, toxins that bind to the S5P loop of other VGK channels, e.g. agitoxin and charybdotoxin (25Garcia M.L. Gao Y. McManus O.B. Kaczorowski G.J. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), do not bind to HERG. Conversely, toxins that bind to this region of HERG, e.g. ErgToxin and BeKm-1, do not bind to other members of the VGK family (26Gurrola G.B. Rosati B. Rocchetti M. Pimienta G. Zaza A. Arcangeli A.

Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), great progress has been made in the understanding of the spatial arrangement of amino acid side chains in the pore region of K+ channels. Nevertheless, the crystallization and determination of the structure of ion channels remains a tremendously difficult task (31Rosenbusch J.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and to date no structures of mammalian ion channels have been determined (32Choe S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). For this reason, CD spectropolarimetry (33Halsall A. Dempsey C.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 901-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Peled-Zehavi H. Arkin I.T. Engelman D.M. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6828-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and NMR spectroscopy (35Opella S.J. Marassi F.M. Gesell J.J. Valente A.P. Kim Y. Oblatt-Montal M. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 374-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) have been used to gather information on the structure of ion channels and/or domains. Although NMR spectroscopy has limitations in terms of the size of proteins whose structure can be determined, it has the advantage of permitting the determination of structures in a lipid environment (36Opella S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 845-848PubMed Google Scholar), thereby eliminating the problems associated with crystallization of membrane proteins (31Rosenbusch J.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 136: 144-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study we have used a combination of CD spectropolarimetry, two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy, and electrophysiology to investigate the structure and function of the S5P linker of the HERG K+ channel. Our findings show that the S5P linker contains an amphipathic α-helix. Exogenous application of the S5P peptide fragment or a peptide corresponding to the amphipathic α-helix results in altered ionic selectivity and disruption of inactivation of the HERG K+ channel. These results suggest that the amphipathic α-helix in S5P is critical for inactivation of HERG K+ channels. Peptide Preparation—The peptides were synthesized on a 0.50-mmol scale using O-(Benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate activation of Boc-amino acids with in situ neutralization chemistry, as previously described (37Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pep. Prot. Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The syntheses were performed on Boc-Tyr(2BrZ)-OCH2-Pam resin using standard amino acid side chain protection, except that methionine residues at positions 5 and 10 were replaced by the isosteric norleucine residue to prevent adventitious oxidation of the peptide. This step is necessary to stabilize the synthetic peptide and is not expected to affect the peptide conformation (37Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pep. Prot. Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Each residue was reacted for 10 min, and coupling efficiencies were determined by the quantitative ninhydrin reaction. Prior to a standard HF cleavage (10 ml of p-cresol:HF 1:9, 0 °C, 60 min) and workup, the N-terminal Boc protecting group was removed (100% trifluoroacetic acid), followed by formyl group removal (1.5 ml of ethanolamine in 25 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide and 5% water, twice for 30 min). Three peptides were synthesized in this study: a 42-residue peptide corresponding to the S5P linker of HERG (residues Ala570–Tyr611), to which we refer as the S5P peptide; a 42-residue peptide in which the putative amphipathic helix corresponding to residues Gly584–Lys595 (23Pardo-Lopez L. Zhang M. Liu J. Jiang M. Possani L.D. Tseng G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16403-16411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was replaced with a GGGSGGGSGGGS linker, to which we refer as the del-helix peptide; and finally a 19-residue peptide corresponding to the putative amphipathic helix and four residues at each end (i.e. Ser581–Ser599 of wild type HERG), to which we refer as the helix peptide. The NMR spectroscopy sample was prepared by dissolving 2.6 mg of the S5P peptide in ∼400 μl of 90% H2O, 10% D2O (v/v) containing 12 mg of SDS-d25 (∼100 mm; the critical micellar concentration for SDS is 8 mm) in a 5-mm outer diameter susceptibility-matched microcell (Shigemi, Tokyo, Japan). This resulted in a peptide concentration of 1.4 mm and pH 3.3. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectroscopy experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance-600 DRX spectrometer with a 5-mm 1H inverse probe with operating temperatures of 20, 30, and 37 °C. The homo-nuclear two-dimensional experiments that were performed included double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy (38Derome A.E. Williamson M.P. J. Mag. Res. 1990; 88: 177-185Google Scholar) with a phase cycle modified for fast recycle times (38Derome A.E. Williamson M.P. J. Mag. Res. 1990; 88: 177-185Google Scholar), total correlation spectroscopy (39Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Mag. Res. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) with MLEV spin-lock periods of 35 and 90 ms, and nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) (40Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar) with mixing times of 200 and 300 ms. All two-dimensional spectra were acquired using time proportional phase detection (41Marion D. Wuthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). In double quantum-filtered correlation spectroscopy and NOESY experiments, water signal suppression was achieved by low power irradiation at the water resonance during the relaxation delay (1.3 s) and during the mixing period in NOESY experiments. In total correlation spectroscopy experiments, the water signal was suppressed using the WATERGATE gradient module (42Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). All of the spectra were processed using XWIN-NMR software (Bruker, Karlsrühe, Germany). Structure Calculations—Analyses of two-dimensional spectra were carried out using the XEASY program (43Bartels C. Xia T.H. Billeter M. Guntert P. Wuthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Distance constraints were obtained from cross-peak volumes in the NOESY spectra recorded at 30 °C with a mixing time of 200 ms. This yielded 416 nonredundant upper distance constraints. An additional 14 distant constraints for hydrogen bonding were obtained from a hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiment. No ϕ dihedral angle constraints were used in the structure calculations because backbone amide peaks were too broad, probably because of conformational averaging of the peptide structure when in the presence of SDS micelles. The simulated annealing protocol in the torsion angle dynamics program DYANA (44Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar) was used to obtain preliminary three-dimensional structures prior to refinement. Of the 1600 structures generated in DYANA, 40 of the “best” structures, with the lowest NOE violations, were chosen for refinement using the standard simulated annealing script in CNS (45Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). In this refinement process, the high temperature dynamics and cooling cycle were performed in Cartesian space. Analysis of the ensemble of S5P structures was also carried out using PROMOTIF, a program that identifies structural motifs in proteins (46Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The figures were generated using MOLMOL (47Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6487) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimetry—CD spectropolarimetry spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 temperature controller. CD spectropolarimetry data were collected using a 1-mm cuvette over the wavelength range 190–250 nm and with a resolution of 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a response time of 1 s. Final spectra were the sums of three scans accumulated at a speed of 20 nm/min and were base line-corrected. Peptide concentration was 0.45 mg/ml for the S5P peptide or 0.15 mg/ml for the del-helix and helix peptides, in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 3.0 and 7.0, with or without the addition of 100 mm SDS. The data are presented as molar ellipticity [θ], where [θ] = θ/(10 × c × l) and θ is ellipticity (mdeg), c is the molar concentration of the sample (mol/liter), and l is the pathlength in cm. Electrophysiology—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with HERG K+ channels were maintained in culture using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Invitrogen) with 5% fetal bovine serum, as previously described (48Walker B.D. Valenzuela S.M. Singleton C.B. Tie H. Bursill J.A. Wyse K.R. Qiu M.R. Breit S.N. Campbell T.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). CHO cells were plated on 13-mm glass coverslips 48–72 h prior to patch clamp analysis. The coverslips were then placed in a 0.5-ml perfusion chamber mounted on the stage of a Nikon Eclipse TE200 inverted microscope. The cells were superfused with normal Tyrode solution that contained 130 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 0.3 mm KH2PO4, 0.35 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. In the Na+-free external solution NaCl was replaced with N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG)-Cl, and the NaH2PO4 was omitted. The cells were patched using micropipettes fabricated from thin walled borosilicate glass (Vitrex Microhematocrit tubes, Modulohm I/S, Denmark) with a horizontal pipette puller (model P-87; Sutter Instrument Co.). The pipette solution contained 120 mm potassium gluconate, 20 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgATP, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The permeability ratio of K+/Na+, α, was calculated from the reversal potential measured in standard Tyrode solution using the following constant field equation, Erev=RT/Fln[(α[K+]o+[Na+]o)/(α[K+]i+[Na+]i)(Eq. 1) and assuming that [K+]i = 145 mm and [Na+]i = 5 mm. Conventional whole cell voltage clamp recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier interfaced with a Digidata 1200 A/D converter operated using pClamp software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature. Whole cell capacitance was determined from capacitative transient decay in current recordings following voltage steps ± 10 mV from the holding potential, and at least 80% series resistance compensation was achieved in all of the reported experiments. The protocols used in the specific experiments are described in the figure legends. In all protocols a 20-ms duration 20 mV step from the holding potential of -80 to -100 mV was applied at the start of each sweep to enable off-line leak correction. We assumed that the leak was linear in the voltage range -120 to +40 mV. Data analysis was performed using the Clampfit module of the PClamp software. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. for n experiments, and analysis of variance was performed using Microsoft Excel. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. For electrophysiology experiments the peptides were prepared as 0.5 mm stock solutions in either normal Tyrode or Na+-free external solution, and aliquots were stored at -20 °C. Once thawed aliquots were stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. The aliquots were diluted as required on the day of experiment. The peptides were applied to cells using a picospritzer II (Intracell, Cambridge, UK) to ensure rapid application (typically less that 20 ms) and minimize the amount of peptide used in each experiment. A new coverslip was used for each experiment to ensure no residual contamination of cells with peptides. Analysis of Peptide Binding Data—Apparent on rates, (λ) and off rates (k -1) for peptide binding were obtained by fitting single exponential functions to the data for onset of current block and recovery of current following washout of the peptide. The on rate (k +1) was calculated using the formula, λ=[peptide]·k+1+k-1(Eq. 2) To obtain the time constant for the apparent on rate of peptide binding at negative potentials, it was necessary to correct for channel deactivation (see Fig. 9). We assumed that the rate of binding of the peptide to the channel was independent of the rate of deactivation, and therefore, Iobs=A·exp(-t/τobs)+C=A·exp(-t/τdeact)·exp(-t/τon)+C(Eq. 3) where A and C are constants, τobs is the observed single exponential time constant measured from the rate of change in current following addition of the peptide, τdeact is the time constant of deactivation (estimated from the single exponential fit to the current recorded in the absence of peptide), and τon is the apparent time constant for peptide binding, i.e. τon = 1/λ. Circular Dichroism Spectropolarimetry—Far-UV CD spectropolarimetry spectra of the S5P HERG peptide in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer with and without 100 mm SDS at 20 °C and pH 3.0 are shown in Fig. 2. The large minimum between 195 and 200 nm and ellipticity close to zero at 222 nm for the S5P peptide in aqueous solution (thin line) indicates that the peptide does not have a well defined secondary structure under these conditions. This outcome prompted our investigation of the structural properties of the peptide under membrane-like conditions. A dramatic change in the CD spectropolarimetry spectral profile was observed upon addition of 100 mm SDS (Fig. 2, thick line); positive ellipticity was observed between 190 and 195 nm, the position of the minimum shifted to 205 nm, and a marked shoulder was present at 222 nm. This indicated that the S5P peptide contains helical elements in the micellar environment at pH 3.0. Similar CD spectropolarimetry profiles were obtained at pH 7.0 (also see Fig. 10) and over the temperature range 20–30 °C. NMR spectroscopy experiments were therefore performed at a pH level of ∼3 to facilitate data collection.Fig. 10A, far-UV CD spectropolarimetry spectra for S5P peptides. All three peptides display a predominantly random coil conformation in aqueous environment (thin lines) with little evidence for secondary structure. However, in the presence of SDS micelles (thick lines) both the S5P peptide and the helix peptide display elements of helical structure, whereas the del-helix remains unstructured. Calculation of the mean residue molar ellipticity, which takes into account the number of peptide bonds in the peptide, indicates that the helix peptide is almost completely helical in SDS micelles, with very little of the sequence in alternative conformations, whereas the S5P contains significant random coil content in addition to the helical elements. This is consistent with the experimentally determined structure of the S5P peptide and what would be expected from secondary structure prediction algorithms. B, typical examples of HERG currents recorded at -80 mV test potentials under control conditions (thin traces) and following addition of peptides (thick traces). S5P peptide causes a shift to inward current, the del-helix peptide has minimal effect on the current and the helix peptide has a similar effect to the full-length peptide. The dotted line in each trace indicates the zero current level.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) NMR Spectroscopy—The two-dimensional NOESY spectrum of the S5P peptide in aqueous solution at 25 °C had only a few very weak cross-peaks, suggesting that the peptide had a flexible, predominantly random coil structure (data not shown) that was consistent with the CD spectropolarimetry data (Fig. 2). The number and intensity of cross-peaks in the two-dimensional NOESY spectrum improved markedly upon the addition of 100 mm SDS. The appearance of amide-amide cross-peaks indicated that the peptide contained some helical structure when in the presence of SDS micelles (Fig. 3), in accordance with the CD spectropolarimetry results. Assignments of proton resonances from the S5P peptide were made using standard methods (49Wuthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar) of analyzing two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY spectra. The cross-peaks were generally broader than those in aqueous solution, presumably because of the increased correlation time of the peptide and possible conformational averaging and slow exchange between conformations. At 20 °C, NOE cross-peaks were too broad to analyze and in several instances overlapped with other cross-peaks, especially in the “fingerprint” region. Increasing the temperature brought about significant narrowing of the cross-peaks; however, some NOE cross-peaks became less intense, and a few disappeared. The NOESY spectrum obtained at 30 °C was seen to be the best for resonance assignment and structural calculations, but where possible, spectra obtained at 20 °C or 37 °C were used to resolve peaks that overlapped at 30 °C (see Table S1 in the supplementary data). Before doing the structure calculations, the chemical shift values obtained for Cα protons were analyzed to provide information on possible secondary structure present in the peptide. For this we used the chemical shift index method of Wishart et al. (50Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (2014) Google Scholar). A prominent grouping of chemical shift deviations below -0.1 ppm for most residues between 16 and 22 implied a prominent helix in this part of the molecule (Fig. 4). It is also possible that a short helix is present in the region formed by residues 39–41 because they form a small cluster of three with low chemical shi"

To determine how GSK-3β activity opposes Akt function we used various methods to alleviate GSK-3β suppression in prostate carcinoma cells. In some experiments, LY294002, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (a kinase involved in activating Akt) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were used to activate GSK-3β. In other experiments mutant forms of GSK-3β, GSK-3βΔ9 (a constitutively active deletion mutant of GSK-3β) and GSK-3βY216F (an inactive point mutant of GSK-3β) were used to alter GSK-3β activity. LY294002, TNF-α, and overexpression of wild-type GSK-3β or of GSK-3βΔ9, but not GSK-3βY216F, alleviated the suppression of GSK-3β activity in prostate carcinoma cells and enhanced the turnover of β-catenin. Forced expression of wild-type GSK-3β or of GSK-3βΔ9, but not GSK-3βY216F, suppressed cell growth and showed that the phosphorylation status of GSK-3β can affect its intracellular distribution. When transcription factors activator protein-1 and cyclic AMP-response element (CRE)-binding protein were analyzed as targets of GSK-3β activity, overexpression of wild-type GSK-3β suppressed AP1-mediated transcription and activated CRE-mediated transcription. Overexpression of GSK-3βΔ9 caused an (80-fold) increase in CRE-mediated transcription, which was further amplified (up to 130-fold) by combining GSK-3βΔ9 overexpression with the suppression of Jun activity. This study also demonstrated for the first time that expression of constitutively active GSK-3βΔ9 results in the phosphorylation of CRE-binding protein on serine 129 and enhancement of CRE-mediated transcription in intact cell nuclei.

The crystal structure of GSK-3β has revealed how it recognizes a priming phosphorylation event on prospective substrates with the consensus sequence (S/TXXX(S/T)PO4. Additionally, certain amino acids (Arg96, Arg180, and Lys205) in the substrate binding pocket of GSK-3β determine the specificity of “primed substrate” binding and enzyme inhibition characteristics (1Harwood A.J.

One of these signaling pathways, protein kinase B (or Akt), is often constitutively active in many types of human cancer (15Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell.

Although the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NFκB) is partly responsible for cellular responses to TNF-α through NFκB protein interactions with GSK-3β (30Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), other transcription factors also may be affected by TNF-α, particularly those influenced by Akt suppression of GSK-3β activity. We conducted the present study to 1) determine the effects of alleviating GSK-3β suppression by Akt and assess GSK-3β function in prostate cancer cells, 2) examine the phosphorylation of CREB on Ser129 by GSK-3β in intact cell nuclei and its effects on CRE-mediated transcription, and 3) examine the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β mutants that were altered at critical phosphorylation sites. Cells and Culture Conditions—PC-3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). These cells were maintained in a 1:1 (vol:vol) mixture of Dulbecco's minimal essential medium and F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Reagents—Recombinant TNF-α, IGF-1, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were purchased from R&D Systems Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-Tyr(P)216-GSK-3 anti-β-catenin (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-GSK-3β-specific, anti-Ser(P)9-GSK-3, and anti-Ser(P)63-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were purchased from the respective manufacturers. Rabbit anti-Ser(P)133-CREB antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-Ser(P)9-GSK-3 and anti-Jun antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. Goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Preparation of Anti-CKRREILS129RRPS133YR-CREB Antibody— Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a diphosphorylated CREB peptide CKRREILS129RRPS133YR. The diphospho peptide CKRREILS129RRPS133YR was conjugated with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier by generating a sulfide linkage using maleimide chemistry, and a diphospho peptide antibody was purified on a CKRREILS129RRPS133YR affinity column. A second affinity purification step was carried out using a monophospho peptide CKRREILSRRPS133YR affinity column to eliminate antibodies that interacted with the monophosphorylated peptide. The resulting pass-through fraction produced an anti-diphospho peptide antibody that was high titer (1:173,000) based on a peptide linked-enzyme immunosorbent assay that failed to bind CKRREILSRRPS133YR but could specifically recognize both CKRREILS129RRPSYR and CKRREILS129RRPS133YR. GSK-3β Assays—PC-3 cells were incubated overnight in serum-free Dulbecco's minimal essential medium/F-12 medium and then incubated with or without 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 20 min. The cells were harvested, and GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated from detergent lysates using an anti-GSK-3β antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Los Angeles, CA). GSK-3β kinase assays were then carried out as described by Pap and Cooper (17Pap M. Cooper G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19929-19932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) using a Ser(P)133-CREB peptide (amino acids 123–135; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mm; Amersham Biosciences). Cells were treated with 20 μm LY294002 (Sigma), a PI3K-specific inhibitor, to inhibit Akt and isolate GSK-3β in an active form. The results were normalized as a relative cpm incorporated into a CREB peptide, compared with untreated control samples, and analyzed for statistical significance using the StatView software program (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared as described by Schaefer et al. (31Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline wash solution (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1× BM complete protease mixture tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 10 μm Na2VO4), they were scrape-harvested into 1.5-ml conical tubes. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 3000 revolutions per min (rpm) at 4 °C for 5 min, and pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 μl of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na2VO4, and 1× BM complete protease mixture inhibitors) and incubated on wet ice for 10 min. The resuspended lysate was centrifuged at 7500 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min. The nuclear suspension as washed 2× and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. Nuclear preparations were examined by light microscopy for the presence of cytosolic components, which were not present. The nuclear pellets were lysed with sodium dodecyl sulfate sample buffer and DNA-sheared through a 20-gauge needle. These lysates were then compared with total cell lysates for the presence of actin. Only trace amounts of actin were present in the nuclear lysate preparations, whereas the actin content was very high in the total cell lysate (data not shown). Western Blot Analysis—PC-3 cells were left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α, 1 ng/ml IGF-1, 10 ng/ml EGF, or 1 μm insulin for 16 h at 37 °C and subsequently analyzed for expression and activation of various proteins. Whole-cell lysates were made from various PC-3 cell samples according to a previously described method (31Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on a NuPAGE 6–12% gradient gel (Novex, Carlsbad, CA), electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with a primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were visualized via Super Signal chemiluminescence (Pierce). Transfection and Luciferase (LUC) Assays—The commercially available plasmids used were pCRE-LUC, pCISCK (an inactive LUC control) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and pAP1-LUC, (BD Biosciences Clontech, PaloAlto, CA). The pCMV-4 control plasmid was a gift from D. Russell. The plasmids were generated in the authors laboratories and included pCDNA3-Flag-JBD, pCGN/GSK-3wt, pCGN/GSK-3Δ9, and pCGN/GSK-3Y216F (32Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z.

The next day, FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) was used to transfect cells in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Each plasmid concentration was 1 μg/ml, unless stated otherwise. To normalize LUC activity either pCRE-LUC or pAP1-LUC was transfected in excess of 6-fold (0.86 μg/ml) greater than Renilla-LUC (0.13 μg/ml; pTK-LUC, Promega, Madison, WI). The transfected cells were harvested and analyzed using the Firelight system (a gift from Corinn Rich and Packard Instrument Co., Naperville, IL) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Quantification was performed in a 96-well black plate using a TOPCOUNT multiwell plate scintillation detector (Packard Instrument Co.) in the photon-counting mode. All pCRE-LUC or pAP1-LUC data were normalized to Renilla-LUC that was co-transfected to determine the effect on the relative promoter activity. To establish if there was any change in the level of pCRE-LUC and pAP1-LUC DNA in PC-3 cells or those cotransfected with GSK-3β LUC, DNA template levels were determined by PCR using primers designed to amplify LUC. The levels of LUC DNA were the same in cells transfected with either pCRE-LUC or pAP1-LUC DNA alone or when LUC reporter constructs were cotransfected with any of the GSK-3β expression vectors (data not shown). Densitometry—These experiments were performed multiple times and quantified by densitometry, and these data were subjected to statistical analysis. All densitometric analyses were performed using a Personal Densitometer SI (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and the corresponding software program, ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). Images were quantified using NIH Image 1.62 (National Institutes of Health), and statistical analysis was performed using StatView 5.01 (SAS Institute Inc.). The density of the proteins analyzed was normalized to the appropriate controls (e.g. actin). Student's t test was used to determine the significant differences between the mean relative densities of the various experimental groups, represented as p values. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described previously (35Menter D.G. Sabichi A.S. Lippman S.M. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2000; 9: 1171-1182PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on laminin-coated coverslips, which were used for TNF-α treatment. The coverslips were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 1% Nonidet P-40 detergent. Next, samples were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin solution in triethanolamine-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). A primary rabbit polyclonal antibody recognizing GSK-3β, Ser(P)133-CREB or Ser(P)129-Ser(P)133-CREB was diluted (1:200; vol:vol) in TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The samples were then rinsed with TBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) in TBST. After the cells were stained with secondary antibodies, counterstaining was performed using 500 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dilactate (Molecular Probes) to identify the nuclei and 1 unit/ml Alexa 594-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in TBST at 4 °C to stain the cytoplasmic actin. The samples were incubated overnight and then washed and mounted on glass slides using Prolong antifade solution (Molecular Probes). The slides were then analyzed via epifluorescence microscopy, and data were acquired using digital image analysis as described previously (35Menter D.G. Sabichi A.S. Lippman S.M. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomark. Prev. 2000; 9: 1171-1182PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Growth—Cell growth was measured using the vital dye calcein AM (CAM) ester (Molecular Probes), which is membrane-permeable and nonfluorescent before activation by nonspecific esterases within viable cells. The cleavage product CAM emits green fluorescence. Cells transfected with either GSK-3β expression vectors or control vector were plated in 96-well plates and incubated with CAM ester in HEPES-buffered saline solution for 15 min at 25 °C. Fluorescence was quantified using a Biolumin 9600 plate reader at 488 nm, and data were analyzed using the Statview software program (SAS Institute, Inc.). Immunostaining of Paraffin Sections for Ser(P)129-S(P)133-CREB— Immunohistochemistry was carried out in paraffin-embedded sections (5 μm) after deparaffinization and rehydration in xylene, graded alcohol, and phosphate-buffered saline, respectively. The endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the sections in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 20 min at room temperature. After blocking the sections with 1.5% normal horse serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, anti-Ser(P)129-Ser(P)133-CREB was applied to the sections and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Then the sections were incubated with the appropriate biotinylated secondary antibody and ABC-AP reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain ABC Elite kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Peroxidase activity was detected with by applying 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride containing 0.02% of hydrogen peroxide for 10 min. The sections were counter-stained with hematoxylin and mounted with coverslips. Molecular Modeling—Structural data obtained from Protein Data Bank code 1KDX (36Radhakrishnan I. Perez-Alvarado G.C. Parker D. Dyson H.J. Montminy M.R. Wright P.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 741-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) were used to generate a model of CREB-kinase inducible domain (KID) and CBP-KID interaction domain interactions. BiotechniX 3d software (Gentech, Parc Sophia Antipolis, France) was used for three-dimensional rendering of CREB on a G4 Titanium Powerbook Computer (Apple Computer Corp., Cupertino, CA). GSK-3β Activity Is Suppressed in PC-3 Cells—Endogenous GSK-3β enzymatic activity was low in PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A, bar 1) as determined by the immune complex kinase assay using CREB peptide as the substrate. This low GSK-3β activity in untreated cells correlated with a relatively high level of phosphorylation on Ser9 (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Because PI3K is involved in the activation of Akt, which in turn phosphorylates GSK-3β at Ser9 and, thus, inactivates it, we treated cells with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, to determine whether GSK-3β is suppressed through this pathway. LY294002 increased GSK-3β activity ∼2-fold (Fig. 1A, bar 2), and this effect was enhanced by combining LY294002 with TNF-α (Fig. 1A, bar 4). This increase in enzyme activity correlated with a decrease in the phosphorylation of Ser9 with LY294002 alone (Fig. 1B, lane 2), which decreased further when LY294002 treatment was combined with TNF-α (Fig 1B, lane 8). Furthermore, PC-3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of LY294002, and then enzymatic activity was determined by CREB peptide phosphorylation along with measuring the phosphorylation of Ser9 by Western analysis. After densitometric quantification, regression analysis was performed using the Statview program to compare the relative GSK-3β enzymatic activity in relation to the inverse value of the mean phospho-Ser9 density. An R 2 value approximately equal to 0.9 indicated that the relative activity of GSK-3β decreased in conjunction with increasing the phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser9. In addition, two PI3K stimulators, EGF and IGF-1(Fig. 1B, lanes 3 and 4, respectively), did not further suppress GSK-3β activity by increasing the phosphorylation of GSK-3β at Ser9 beyond control levels. Similar studies showed that these treatments caused a decrease in β-catenin levels (Fig. 2). Furthermore, results similar to those observed for EGF and IGF were obtained using insulin (data not shown). These results indicate that endogenous GSK-3β activity is largely suppressed by the PI3K pathway in proliferating PC-3 cells and that activation of GSK-3β enhanced the breakdown of β-catenin.Fig. 2The activation of GSK-3β enhanced the turnover of β-catenin. PC-3 cells were left untreated or treated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml), or IGF-1 (1 ng/ml) in the absence (lanes 1–4) or presence (lanes 5–8) of PI3K-specific inhibitor LY294002 (20 μm) for 16 h, and whole-cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. Treatment with PI3K inhibitor LY294002 caused a significant decrease in β-catenin levels. Statistical analysis showed a significant difference (a, p < 0.003) between control samples and TNF-α- or LY294002-treated samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) GSK-3β Stimulated CRE-mediated Transcription and Suppressed Activator Protein-1 (AP1)-mediated Transcription— CREB and Jun family members can take part in binding to and activating CRE-containing promoters; Jun family members can also activate AP1 transcription response elements. To determine how CRE and AP1 transcriptional activities were affected by GSK-3β, PC-3 cells were cotransfected with GSK-3β, with either the CRE or AP1 response element-containing luciferase reporter constructs (CRE-LUC and AP1-LUC, respectively). The CRE-LUC activity in PC-3 cells cotransfected with GSK-3β was 6-fold higher than that in cells transfected with CRE-LUC alone (Fig. 3). The LUC vector without the CRE elements (pCISCK) showed no LUC activity, and the expression vector pCMV4 without the GSK-3 cDNA did not affect LUC activity (data not shown). We also observed that in the absence of cotransfected GSK-3β, AP1-LUC activity was about 20 times higher than for CRE-LUC. In contrast to its effect on CRE-LUC activity, GSK-3β strongly inhibited AP1-LUC activity. These data indicate that overexpression of GSK-3β can differentially regulate CREB-mediated and AP1-mediated activity in PC-3 cells. Phosphorylation of GSK-3β Variants—We next investigated the overexpression of GSK-3β proteins that contained various point mutations or deletions to determine how these molecular changes affected the protein phosphorylation patterns and the intracellular distribution of GSK-3β (Fig. 4). Deletion of the first nine amino acids of GSK-3β results in the GSK-3βΔ9 protein, which is constitutively active and cannot be inactivated by PI3K/Akt. Ser9 phosphorylation was present on all forms of GSK-3β except on the GSK-3βΔ9 transfectants (Fig. 4A, Δ9 lane lower band is absent). In contrast, GSK-3βY216F contains a mutation of tyrosine Tyr216 to a phenylalanine, resulting in a dominant-negative-acting protein that cannot activate CREB. Tyr216 was phosphorylated on endogenous GSK-3β in PC-3 cells (Fig. 4A, lane C) and on the wild-type (wt) and Δ9-transfected forms of GSK-3β. The total Tyr216 phosphorylation was reduced in the GSK-3βY216F transfectants, which included some Tyr216 phosphorylation on endogenous GSK-3β, since the phenylalanine on GSK-3βY216F cannot be phosphorylated (Fig. 4A, lane Y216F).

https://openalex.org/W2014202857,"Voltage-gated calcium (Ca2+) channels play a key role in the control of heart contraction and are essential for normal heart development. The Cav1.2 L-type calcium channel is the predominant isoform in cardiomyocytes and is essential for excitation-contraction coupling. Although the inactivation of the Cav1.2 gene caused embryonic lethality before embryonic day E14.5, hearts were contracting before E14 depending on a dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium influx. We analyzed the consequences of the deletion of the Cav1.2 channel on the expression level of other voltage-gated calcium channels in the embryonic mouse heart and isolated cardiomyocytes. A strong compensatory up-regulation of the Cav1.3 calcium channel was observed on the mRNA as well as on the protein level. Reverse transcriptase PCR indicated that the recently identified new Cav1.3(1b) isoform was strongly up-regulated, whereas a more moderate increase was found for the Cav1.3(1a) variant. Heterologous expression of Cav1.3(1b) in HEK293 cells induced Ba2+ currents with properties similar to those found in Cav1.2 (-/-) cardiomyocytes, suggesting that this isoform constitutes a major component of the residual L-type calcium current in Cav1.2 (-/-) cardiomyocytes. In summary, our results imply that calcium channel expression is dynamically regulated during heart development and that the Cav1.3 channel may substitute for Cav1.2 during early embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2025957324,"Tyrosine phosphorylation of the β2 subunit of clathrin adaptor complex AP-2 was detected in three types of cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF). The tyrosine phosphorylation was observed during recruitment of EGF receptors into coated pits at 4 °C and reached maximum at 37 °C at post-recruitment stages of endocytosis. An inhibitor of EGF receptor kinase completely abolished this phosphorylation in all cell types, whereas the inhibitor of Src family kinases partially inhibited β2 phosphorylation in A-431 cells but not in HeLa cells. By using β2 subunit tagged with yellow fluorescent protein that is effectively assembled into AP-2 complex, the major phosphorylation site of β2 was mapped to Tyr-6. Analysis of cells expressing dominant-interfering mutant μ2 subunit of AP-2 suggested that β2 phosphorylation is partially mediated by the receptor interaction with the μ2 subunit. Mutation of leucine residues 1010 and 1011 motif in the EGF receptor resulted in the severe inhibition of β2 tyrosine phosphorylation. From these data, we propose that interactions of the EGF receptor with AP-2 mediated by the receptor 974YRAL and di-leucine motifs may contribute to β2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Surprisingly, mutation of the Leu-1010/Leu-1011 motif resulted in impaired degradation of EGF receptors, suggesting the role of this motif in lysosomal targeting of the receptor."

Akt phosphorylation increases with GqWT expression but is markedly attenuated in cardiomyocytes expressing GqQ209L or in those expressing GqWT and treated with agonist. A membrane-targeted Akt rescues GqQ209L-expressing cardiomyocytes from apoptotic cell death. In contrast, leukemia inhibitory factor fails to activate Akt or promote cell survival in these cells. Association of Akt and PDK-1 with the membrane is also diminished in GqQ209L-expressing cardiomyocytes.

Expression of a GqQ209L mutant that has diminished capacity to activate phospholipase C does not decrease PIP2 or Akt or induce apoptosis. In transgenic mice with cardiac Gαq overexpression, heart failure and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis develop during the peripartal period.

Thus studies in isolated cardiomyocytes and in transgenic animals have led to the conclusion that although Gαq signaling is critical for cardiac hypertrophy, prolonged or marked enhancement of Gq activity is deleterious to the heart. Our laboratory has characterized a model of in vitro cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis by expressing the α subunit of Gq (8Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). When the wild type α subunit (GqWT) is expressed by adenoviral infection, neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) undergo hypertrophy (8Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast, when the constitutively active α subunit (GqQ209L) is expressed, or GqWT-expressing cardiomyocytes are treated with Gq-coupled receptor agonists, the NRVMs undergo apoptosis (8Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 12Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Varying the amount of Gαq signaling in myocytes therefore results in distinct cellular phenotypes. Although modest levels of signaling induce hypertrophy, at higher levels survival is diminished and apoptosis ensues. This provides a paradigm for elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which Gαq signaling can transition from stimulation of hypertrophic growth to the development of apoptosis. We demonstrated previously (12Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that expression of GqQ209L leads to apoptosis through mitochondrial permeability (PT) pore opening, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation. Sustained Gαq signaling, beyond the level that causes hypertrophy, may also compromise normal survival pathways. A well documented cell survival pathway is the PI3K/phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1/Akt (PI3K/PDK-1/Akt) pathway (13Krasilnikov M.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 65: 59-67PubMed Google Scholar). PI3K generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to stimulate the membrane colocalization of PDK-1 and Akt (14Matsui T.

In cardiomyocytes, Akt has been shown to be activated by agonists that stimulate tyrosine kinase receptors (e.g. insulin and insulin-like growth factor (15Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N.

Akt has been reported to protect cardiomyocytes from apoptosis induced by serum deprivation or hypoxia (14Matsui T. Li L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 15Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo gene transfer of activated Akt protects against cell death and the development of cardiomyopathies caused by ischemia-reperfusion and doxorubicin treatment (22Matsui T. Tao J. del Monte F. Lee K.H. Li L. Picard M. Force T.L. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 2001; 104: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 23Miao W. Luo Z. Kitsis R.N.

Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1241-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The critical role of Akt in cardioprotection underscores the need to examine the regulation of PI3K, PIP3 formation, and PDK-1 activity and determine how these control Akt activation in cardiomyocytes. We report here that increasing Gq signaling to pathological levels results in a loss of the protective PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This occurs at a time point that precedes the appearance of apoptotic markers such as cytochrome c release and nuclear fragmentation. This contrasts directly with the enhanced Akt phosphorylation seen in cardiomyocytes that undergo hypertrophy in response to expression of GqWT. Our investigation into the pathways leading to the down-regulation of Akt activation in cardiomyocytes expressing GqQ209L revealed an unexpected decrease in cellular levels of PIP2, the substrate for both PLC and PI3K, which appeared to be related to the Gq-mediated increase in PLC activity. Importantly, in vivo studies also revealed decreased Akt phosphorylation and PIP2 levels in a Gq-expressing model of heart failure. We suggest that PIP3 generation and Akt activation are influenced by the availability of PIP2 and that this serves as a nodal point in determining the balance between hypertrophic and apoptotic pathways. Cardiomyocyte Culture and Adenoviral Infection—NRVMs were prepared and infected with adenoviruses as described previously (8Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Briefly, cardiomyocytes were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106 cells per 6-cm dish or 3 × 105 per well of a 6-well plate in serum-containing media overnight. The cells were then washed, and the medium was replaced with serum-free medium supplemented with insulin/transferrin/selenium (ITS). Cells were infected with adenoviruses at 200-500 viral particles/cell for 16-18 h or as indicated. Cells were subsequently washed and maintained in serum-free medium with supplements. The p110WT and p110caax expressing adenoviruses were kindly provided by Dr. Jerry Olefsky (University of California, San Diego) (25Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Nakashima N. Huang Y. Huver E. Boss G.R.

The GqWT and GqQ209L adenoviruses have been characterized previously, and the GqQ209LDNE adenovirus was subcloned into adenovirus from a plasmid obtained from Dr. John Exton (Vanderbilt University), by using our method published previously (8Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Measurements—Oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation was analyzed by DNA laddering as described previously (12Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Nuclear condensation was visualized using fluorescence microscopy after staining with Hoechst 33342 as described previously (12Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and Bradford analysis was performed. Equal micrograms of protein (10-30 μg) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE, run, transferred to an Immobilon membrane, and the resulting blot probed using the following antibodies. The Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphospecific antibodies for Akt, as well as the Pan-Akt antibody, were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies. Anti-PTEN and anti-p85 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-SHIP-2 was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody against the cardiac sodium/calcium exchanger was purchased from Swant. p110α (Transduction Laboratories), p110β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p110γ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were kind gifts from Dr. Stephanie Watts (Michigan State University). The phospho-PDK-1 antibody (Cell Signaling) was a kind gift from Dr. Alexandra Newton's laboratory (University of California, San Diego). Measurement of [3H]PIP 3 —NRVMs plated at 4 × 106 cells on 10-cm plates were labeled with 30 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 36 h, and then infected with control, GqWT, or GqQ209L adenoviruses overnight, and harvested 24 h later. Cells were extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm phytic acid; the lysates were sonicated for 10 s, and lipid-containing material was pelleted by centrifugation. [3H]Inositol-labeled phospholipids in the trichloroacetic acid pellet were extracted with chloroform/methanol/hydrochloric acid (200:100:1, v/v) and subsequently deacylated using methylamine/methanol/butanol (42:47:9) for 45 min at 50 °C as described previously (27Woodcock E.A. Suss M.B. Anderson K.E. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 252-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), treated with proteinase K (28Woodcock E.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and then separated by anion-exchange HPLC and quantified using an on-line β-counter (28Woodcock E.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Measurement of PIP 2 —To measure [3H]PIP2, cells (1.5 × 106 on 6-cm dishes) were incubated with 5 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 36 h, prior to infection with the indicated adenoviruses. [3H]Inositol phospholipids were extracted and deacylated as described above. The final aqueous phase containing the deacylated lipids was loaded onto Dowex-1 (formate) columns. The columns were washed with 400 mm ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid to remove [3H]glycerophosphoinositol (deacylated phosphatidylinositol) and [3H]glycerophosphoinositol(4)monophosphate. [3H]Glycerophosphoinositol(4,5)bisphosphate was eluted with 10 ml of 1 m ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid. Samples were counted in a β-counter. For the mass measurement of PIP2, unlabeled lipids were extracted and deacylated as described above except 5 mm ATP replaced phytic acid in the extraction buffer. Deacylated lipids were deglycerated by treating with periodate (50 mm) for 30 min with the reaction being terminated by adding 10% ethylene glycol followed by 0.3% dimethylhydrazine (27Woodcock E.A. Suss M.B. Anderson K.E. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 252-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting Ins(1,4,5)P3 was assayed by competitive binding assay (BioTrak IP3 Assay protocol, Amersham Biosciences), as described by the supplier. Cell Fractionation Studies—Fractionation was performed as described (29Sonnenburg E.D. Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, NRVMs were harvested in detergent-free lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 40 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium vanadate (NaVO3)), frozen at -80 °C for 5 min, and then sonicated for 2 min in a bath sonicator. The resulting cytoplasmic fraction was cleared by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. After removing the supernatant (cytosolic fraction), the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 40 μg/ml leupeptin), sonicated for 2 min, and centrifuged again at 100,00 × g for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was analyzed as the membrane fraction, and the pellet as the insoluble fraction. G q Transgenic Mouse Studies—Female Gq transgenic mice (kindly provided by Dr. G. W. Dorn II, University of Cincinnati Medical Center) and nontransgenic littermate control mice were mated, and 5 days after parturition, hearts were excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Age-matched virgin mice were used as controls. Procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The frozen hearts were powdered and homogenized in lysis buffer, and 30 μg of protein was loaded onto SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis as described above. For PIP2 mass analysis, 10 mg of powder was homogenized in trichloroacetic acid; then the lipids were deacylated and deglycerated before being subjected to the same mass assay as described above. Statistical Analysis—All results are reported as mean ± S.E. Comparisons of two groups only were accomplished using unpaired Student's t test. Experiments with more than two groups were compared by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Tukey post-hoc test for comparison between groups. Phospho-Akt Levels Are Diminished in G q Q209L-expressing NRVMs—Expression of a constitutively active mutant of Gαq (GqQ209L) induces apoptosis in NRVMs, whereas expression of the GqWT protein induces a sustained hypertrophy with no evidence of cell death (8Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this might reflect differential activation of protective pathways such as those initiated by phosphorylation of Akt. NRVMs were infected with viruses expressing GqWT, GqQ209L, or control virus backbone for 16 h followed by washing out of the viruses. Cells were harvested immediately after removal of the virus or after a further 8 or 24 h. All of these time points precede the development of apoptosis (36-48 h after overnight infection) (12Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and exhibited similar results. As shown in Fig. 1, at 8 h after virus removal, GqWT expression caused a 3-fold increase in Akt phosphorylation (Fig 1, A and B) relative to control. Treating GqWT-expressing myocytes with PGF2α to further enhance Gq activity abolished this increase in Akt phosphorylation. Enhancing Gq activity even further, via expression of the constitutively active GqQ209L, resulted in a marked (45%) decrease in Akt phosphorylation, relative to control. Total Akt levels did not differ in GqWT or GqQ209L-expressing NRVMs versus control (Fig. 1A). Akt Can Prevent G q Q209L-induced Apoptosis—The observation that levels of phospho-Akt were markedly decreased in GqQ209L-expressing cells suggested that the loss of this survival pathway could be a critical factor in the apoptotic response to GqQ209L. If this is so, then direct activation of Akt should prevent GqQ209L-induced apoptosis. To examine this possibility, NRVMs were coinfected with GqQ209L along with adenovirus expressing a constitutively activated Akt construct in which the c-Src myristoylation sequence was fused to the N terminus of Akt (myr-Akt). This membrane-targeted form of Akt has been reported to prevent serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in cultured cardiomyocytes and to reduce apoptosis caused by ischemia-reperfusion in vivo (15Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) or hypoxia in vitro (14Matsui T. Li L. del Monte F. Fukui Y. Franke T.F. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Several independent indices of apoptosis were examined 36-48 h after infection to establish whether myr-Akt could protect the myocytes from GqQ209L-induced apoptosis. The characteristic laddering pattern resulting from oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation is prominent in GqQ209L-expressing cells undergoing apoptosis (8Adams J.W. Sakata Y. Davis M.G. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Liggett S.B. Chien K.R. Brown J.H. Dorn G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10140-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and this was reduced in cells in which myr-Akt was expressed along with GqQ209L (Fig. 2A). In addition, whereas disorganization of myofilaments is evident in cells expressing GqQ209L (12Adams J.W. Pagel A.L. Means C.K. Oksenberg D. Armstrong R.C. Brown J.H. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 1180-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the expression of myr-Akt along with GqQ209L preserved myofilament organization (Fig. 2B). Finally, Hoechst staining was used to quantitate the number of cells with fragmented nuclei following infection with GqQ209L, myrAkt, or both viruses together. Expression of myr-Akt reduced the number of fragmented nuclei in GqQ209L-infected cells by ∼60% (Fig. 2C). The effect of enhancing Akt activity supports the notion that decreases in Akt activity play a central role in the development of GqQ209L-induced apoptosis. LIF Does Not Prevent Apoptosis or Activate Akt in G q Q209L-expressing NRVMs—Cytokines that act via the gp130 receptor, including LIF and cardiotrophin 1 (CT-1), induce PI3K-dependent Akt phosphorylation (21Oh H.

Kishimoto I. Miyamoto Y. Harada M. Ogawa E. Hamanaka I. Kajiyama N. Takahashi N. Izumi T. Kawakami R. Nakao K. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1385-1394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and can prevent apoptosis induced by serum deprivation in NRVMs (31Sheng Z. Knowlton K. Chen J. Hoshijima M. Brown J.H. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5783-5791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). When NRVMs were placed in serum-free medium lacking supplementation with ITS, apoptosis ensued. LIF was able to prevent the development of apoptosis as assessed by DNA laddering (Fig. 3A, 5th and 6th lanes). In contrast, LIF failed to protect against GqQ209L-induced DNA laddering (Fig. 3A, 2nd to 4th lanes). Because LIF may not be sufficiently stable to signal for the periods needed for protection from cell death, we added additional LIF to the GqQ209L-expressing cells, throughout the course of GqQ209L expression (data not shown). Even under these conditions, LIF failed to rescue the GqQ209L phenotype. In addition, whereas acute treatment with LIF markedly increased Akt phosphorylation in control NRVMs, it failed to do so in GqQ209L-expressing myocytes (Fig. 3B). The lack of Akt activation by LIF would appear to be responsible for the inability of this cytokine to prevent GqQ209L-expressing NRVMs from undergoing apoptosis. Phosphatase Inhibition Does Not Restore Akt Phosphorylation in G q Q209L-expressing NRVMs—We considered the possibility that GqQ209L expression might diminish Akt phosphorylation by activating phosphatases, such as PP2A, that can dephosphorylate Akt (32Schmidt M. Evellin S. Weernink P.A. von Dorp F. Rehmann H. Lomasney J.W. Jakobs K.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1020-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Calyculin, a phosphatase inhibitor with specificity for PP1 and PP2A, was used to test this possibility. In both control-infected and GqQ209L-expressing NRVMs pretreated for 30 min with calyculin, basal Akt phosphorylation was enhanced, demonstrating some endogenous control by phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. However, LIF was unable to increase Akt phosphorylation in GqQ209L-expressing cells even when these phosphatases were inhibited (Fig. 3C). This argues against enhanced dephosphorylation of Akt as the mechanism by which GqQ209L expression limits Akt activation and cell survival. G q Q209L-expressing Cells Do Not Exhibit an Increase in PIP 3 —Because it was not possible to stimulate Akt phosphorylation using the cytokine LIF, and a calyculin-sensitive phosphatase did not appear to be involved, we turned our focus upstream of Akt phosphorylation. Activation of Akt is often used as a surrogate for changes in PIP3 levels because Akt phosphorylation by PDK-1 is PIP3-dependent. We therefore asked whether there was diminished PIP3 production in GqQ209L-expressing cells. To our knowledge, there are no published reports of direct PIP3 measurements in cardiomyocytes, and PIP3 levels at rest are thought to be extremely low. To establish the feasibility of measuring [3H]PIP3 in NRVMs, we labeled cells (4 × 106 per plate) with 30 μCi/ml of myo-[3H]inositol for 36 h and used an adenoviral vector to express a membrane-targeted, and thus constitutively active, PI3K catalytic subunit (p110caax). The wild type p110 subunit of PI3K (p110WT), which does not target to membranes, served as a control. [3H]Inositol phospholipids were extracted and quantified using HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Chromatographic analysis of extracts from cells expressing p110caax revealed a peak at the expected elution time of PIP3. The corresponding peak in p110WT-expressing cells was substantially smaller, confirming the identity of the peak as PIP3 (Fig. 4). We then examined [3H]PIP3 levels in cells infected with control, GqWT, and GqQ209L-expressing adenoviruses. HPLC analysis revealed significant levels of [3H]PIP3 in GqWT-expressing cells (Fig. 5). In contrast, PIP3 was barely detectable in cells expressing GqQ209L.Fig. 5Reduced [3H]PIP3 content in GqQ209L-versus GqWT-expressing NRVMs. NRVMs were labeled with 30 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol for 36 h prior to infection with control, GqWT-, or GqQ209L-expressing adenovirus overnight. 24 h later, 3H-labeled phospholipids were extracted and quantified by HPLC, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative HPLC traces showing PIP2 and PIP3 peaks are shown for each group.

https://openalex.org/W2105058345,"Very little is known about the contribution of a low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75, to neurotransmitter release. Here we show that nerve growth factor (NGF) induced a rapid release of glutamate and an increase of Ca2+ in cerebellar neurons through a p75-dependent pathway. The NGF-induced release occurred even in the presence of the Trk inhibitor K252a. The release caused by NGF but not brain-derived neurotrophic factor was enhanced in neurons overexpressing p75. Further, after transfection of p75-small interfering RNA, which down-regulated the endogenous p75 expression, the NGF-induced release was inhibited, suggesting that the NGF-induced glutamate release was through p75. We found that the NGF-increased Ca2+ was derived from the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ receptor and that the NGF-increased Ca2+ was essential for the NGF-induced glutamate release. Furthermore, scyphostatin, a sphingomyelinase inhibitor, blocked the NGF-dependent Ca2+ increase and glutamate release, suggesting that a ceramide produced by sphingomyelinase was required for the NGF-stimulated Ca2+ increase and glutamate release. This action of NGF only occurred in developing neurons whereas the brain-derived neurotrophic factor-mediated Ca2+ increase and glutamate release was observed at the mature neuronal stage. Thus, we demonstrate that NGF-mediated neurotransmitter release via the p75-dependent pathway has an important role in developing neurons.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 269-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Recently, studies have shown that neurotrophins play a fundamental role in the acute effects on neuronal plasticity. In particular, BDNF has important roles in neuronal transmissions and activity-dependent neuronal plasticity (4Thoenen H. Science. 1995; 270: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (1721) Google Scholar, 5Lu B. Chow A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). As an example, BDNF was reported to induce excitatory transmissions (6Lessmann V. Gottmann K. Heumann R. Neuroreport. 1994; 6: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), an influx of Ca2+ and Na+ (7Li H.S. Xu X.Z. Montell C.

Nature. 1999; 401: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), and increased intracellular Ca2+ (9Berninger B. Garcia D.E. Inagaki N. Hahnel C. Lindholm D. Neuroreport. 1993; 4: 1303-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We also reported that BDNF induced the release of excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate through a TrkB/PLC-γ/IP3-dependent pathway in cultured cortical and cerebellar neurons (10Numakawa T.

On the whole, these actions of BDNF were dependent on the activation of a specific receptor, TrkB, which is broadly expressed in the brain. On the other hand, the expression of TrkA, a high affinity receptor for NGF, is very restricted, and only limited neuronal populations (for instance, cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain) exhibited biological responses to NGF (12Hatanaka H. Tsukui H. Nihonmatsu I. Brain Res. 1988; 467: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Fagan A.M. Garber M. Barbacid M. Silos-Santiago I. Holtzman D.M. J.

J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1373-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and is expressed in a wide range of both neuronal and non-neuronal cells (15Huber L.J. Chao M.V. Dev.

Pathol. 2000; 157: 1247-1258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). NGF also binds to the p75 receptor, which binds other neurotrophins with similar affinity, including BDNF, neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5), and NT-3. The p75 receptor was found to be necessary for amplifying NGF/TrkA-mediated biological effects in early reports (17Hempstead B.L. Martin-Zanca D. Kaplan D.R. Parada L.F. Chao M.V.

In addition to increasing the response of cells co-expressing p75 and Trks, p75 is also able to transduce signals in the absence of Trks; for example, NGF activated the transcription factor nuclear factor κB, c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, and ceramide generation via p75 (20Dobrowsky R.T.

Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). In particular, studies on neurotrophin-dependent neuronal cell death have focused on the role of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, mixed lineage kinase, and p53 (23Aloyz R.S. Bamji S.X. Pozniak C.D.

Endogenous ceramide can be generated by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin stimulated by neurotrophins via activation of p75 (20Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and is known to be a second messenger that works in diverse intracellular pathways, with effects on neuronal outgrowth/survival and death (27Brann A.B.

Neurochem. 2002; 81: 594-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) indicated that the NGF-selective binding of p75 resulted in the promotion of survival and protection from apoptosis. Interestingly, Yamashita et al. (32Yamashita T. Wada R. Sasaki T. Deng C. Bierfreund U. Sandhoff K. Proia R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9142-9147Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) reported that GTPase RhoA activity, modulated by p75, participated in axonal outgrowth. Furthermore, Blochl and Sirrenberg (33Blochl A. Sirrenberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21100-21107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) reported that NGF affected dopamine release via p75 in cultured mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. These studies suggest that not only Trks but also the p75 receptor is physiologically important in the neuronal system. However, very little is known about p75 receptor-dependent regulation in the glutamatergic system, and the intracellular mechanism including the Ca2+ dependence of transmitter release following p75 activation is still unclear. In this study, we found that NGF induced a rapid release of glutamate from cultured cerebellar neurons. It was revealed that the release did not require the activation of Trks but did require the p75 receptor, which induced the activation of sphingomyelinase, the generation of ceramide, and an increase in Ca2+ through the ryanodine Ca2+ receptor. Furthermore, we found that the NGF-induced release of glutamate was only observed in immature cerebellar neurons. We propose that an acute action of NGF through the p75 receptor is involved in the release of neurotransmitters in developing cerebellar neurons. Cell Culture—Primary dissociated cultures were prepared from 4- to 5-day-old rat (SLC, WistarST, Japan) cerebellum as reported previously (12Hatanaka H. Tsukui H. Nihonmatsu I. Brain Res. 1988; 467: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were gently dissociated with a plastic pipette after digestion with papain (90 units/ml; Worthington) at 37 °C. For the measurement of amino acids, the dissociated cells were plated at a final density of 4–5 × 105/cm2 on polyethyleneimine-coated 12- and 24-well plates (4- or 2-cm2 surface area/well, respectively; Corning Glass). The culture medium consisted of 5% precolostrum newborn calf serum, 5% heated-inactivated horse serum, and 90% of a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium containing 15 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, 30 nm Na2SeO3, and 1.9 mg/ml NaHCO3. The cultures were maintained for 1–14 days. Preparation and Titration of Adenovirus Vectors—cDNA of NLS-LacZ and rat p75 were subcloned into the SwaI site of the cosmid vector pAxCAwt under the control of the CAG promoter (34Kanegae Y. Lee G. Sato Y. Tanaka M. Nakai M. Sakaki T. Sugano S. Saito I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3816-3821Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 35Murakami T. Niwa M. Tokunaga F. Miyata T. Iwanaga S. Chemotherapy. 1991; 3: 327-334Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These cosmid vectors and the EcoT221-digested DNA-terminal protein complex (DNA-TPC) of Ad5-dlX, which is a human type 5 adenovirus lacking the E3 region, were co-transfected into HEK 293 cells by the calcium phosphate method. The recombinant adenoviruses AxCAANLS-LacZ and AxCAAp75 generated by homologous recombination in HEK 293 cells were isolated. As the recombinant adenoviruses did not include the E1A region, PCR amplification of this region was performed to ensure no contamination by wild type adenovirus (Ad5-dlX). The recombinant adenoviruses, which showed no PCR amplification of E1a, were then used, propagated in HEK 293 cells, and purified by cesium gradient centrifugation (36Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The viral titer was determined by a plaque-forming assay on HEK 293 cells. We performed adenovirus-mediated gene transfer 24 h prior to the neurotrophin stimulation. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were stained with two anti-p75 antibodies or an anti-MAP2 antibody (rabbit IgG; a gift from Dr. H. Murofushi, University of Tokyo). Briefly, for staining with MC-192 (conditioned medium from hybridoma cells, a gift from Dr. M. V. Chao), anti-p75 antibody, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with MC192 diluted 1:200 in 0.05% Triton X solution. The other anti-p75 antibody (Promega) was incubated at a 1:500 dilution. The anti-MAP2 antibody was used at 1:1000. Cells were visualized using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) together with 0.02% (w/v) 3,3′-diaminobenzidine 4HCl and 0.1% (w/v) (NH4)Ni(SO4)2 dissolved in 0.05 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.01% (v/v) H2O2. p75-siRNA Transfection—Design and transfection of siRNA were performed as reported by Higuchi et al. (37Higuchi H. Yamashita T. Yoshikawa H. Tohyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We used 23-nucleotide siRNA duplexes with two 3′ overhanging nucleotides targeting the position 88–110 of the rat p75 mRNA coding region (aaggagacauguuccacaggccu). Both sense and antisense strands were chemically synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. The control siRNA (ScrambleII) whose sequence (gcgcgcuuuguaggauucg) had no homology to any mammalian mRNA was provided by Dharmacon Research Inc. Transfection of siRNAs was performed using GeneSilencer siRNA transfection reagent (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc.). We carried out p75-siRNA or control-siRNA (ScrambleII) transfer 48 h prior to the neurotrophin stimulation. Both siRNAs were applied at 2 mg/ml. Detection of Amino Acid Neurotransmitters—The amount of amino acids released from the cultures was measured as described previously (11Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 38Numakawa T. Yokomaku D. Kiyosue K. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Numakawa Y. Taguchi T. Hatanaka H. Yamada M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28861-28869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amino acids released into the modified HEPES-buffered Krebs Ringer assay buffer (130 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2,10mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a fluorescence detector (excitation wavelength, 340 nm; emission wavelength, 445 nm; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). NGF and BDNF dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) were added to the cultured neurons by bath application. Sample fractions were collected every minute. Before exposing the cultures to these neurotrophins (1 min), basal fractions (1 min) were collected. The high KCl (HK+) solution consisted of 85 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The Ca2+-free solution was prepared by omitting the CaCl2. Thapsigargin (1.0 μm) (Research Biochemicals, Natick, MA) was added 30 min prior to NGF stimulation. BAPTA-AM (Research Biochemicals) was used at 100 nm. Dantrolene (Tocris Cookson Ltd.), a ryanodine calcium channel receptor antagonist, was applied at 0.1, 1.0, or 10 μm for 20 min before the assay. Scyphostatin (a gift from Sankyo Inc., Tokyo), a sphingomyelinase inhibitor, was applied for 20 min at 0.1 or 1.0 μm. Xestospongin C (Calbiochem), an IP3 calcium channel receptor antagonist, was applied at 10 μm for 1 h before the assay. When the effects of the various drugs on NGF-, BDNF- or ceramide-induced glutamate release were examined, the neurons were washed three times, and sample fractions in the presence of these drugs were collected. C2-ceramide, C6-ceramide, and C6-dihydroceramide were purchased from Biomol Research Labs., Inc. The glutamate release experiments were performed at least four times with independent cultures to confirm reproducibility. Representative data from a sister culture (n indicates the number of wells of a plate) are shown in the figures. Ca2 + Imaging—Cells were cultured on polyethyleneimine-coated plates (Matsunami, Osaka, Japan) attached to flexiperm (IN VITRO). After being washed, the cells were incubated for1hat37 °C with 10 μm Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted in HEPES-buffered Krebs Ringer assay buffer. The dye intensity was monitored using a confocal laser microscope (RCM 8000; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were irradiated with an excitation blue light beam (488 nm) produced by an argon ion laser. The emitted fluorescence was guided through a ×40 water-immersion objective to a pinhole diaphragm at 520 nm using a diachronic mirror. The intensity of emission was scanned at a dwell time of [1/30] s with a monitor video enhancer. Image data were obtained every 2 or 4 s. The data were stored in an RCM work station and analyzed. The fluorescent dye intensity stimulated by neurotrophins or ceramide analogs was normalized to the baseline before stimulation. It was confirmed that the dye fluorescence intensities were stable with minimum bleach for more than 3 min in vehicle solution. All imaging experiments were performed at least six times with separate cultures. Representative data from neurons in a sister culture are shown in the figures. Immunoblotting—The cerebrums and cerebellums were segregated and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm Na2P2O7, and 100 μm phenylarsine oxide). Cultured neurons were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in the same buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was analyzed. Samples were heat-denatured with standard SDS sample buffer. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (11Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The anti-TrkB monoclonal antibody (clone 47) was purchased from BD Biosciences (1:1000). The anti-p75 polyclonal antibody was from Promega (1:1000). The anti-phospho-Trk antibody and the anti-pan Trk polyclonal antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (1:1000), and the peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (1:1000). The anti-ClassIII β-tublin (TUJ1) was purchased from Berkeley Antibody Company (Richmond, CA) (1:1000). Mg2 + -dependent Neutral Sphingomyelinase Activity—The Mg2+-dependent neutral sphingomyelinase activity was determined as described previously (39Nara F. Tanaka M. Hosoya T. Suzuki-Konagai K. Ogita T. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1999; 52: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) except for the preparation of cell extracts. The cerebellar neurons cultured for 7 days on 100-mm dishes were stimulated with NGF or BDNF (both at 100 ng/ml) for the periods indicated in the figure. The cells were lysed in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm leupeptin, and 250 mm sucrose by repeated freezing and thawing, and after low speed centrifugation (500 × g) to remove cell debris, the supernatant was used in the assay as a cell extract. Neutral sphingomyelinase activity was calculated by subtracting the control counts obtained from samples without Mg2+. We have already checked the intrinsic neutral sphingomyelinase activity in the cell extracts with or without a divalent cation chelator. The reaction proceeded linearly for at least 1 h under the assay conditions. The identity of the product in the upper phase was confirmed previously by thin-layer chromatography. The experiments were performed four times with separate cultures. Ceramide Quantitation—Cultured cerebellar neurons on 100-mm dishes were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of NGF for the periods indicated in the figure. After several washes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 1.2 ml of chloroform/methanol (1:2) (v/v) was added directly to the dishes. The lipid extraction was essentially as described (40Veldhoven P.P.V. Bell R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 959: 185-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Ceramide levels were measured enzymatically using diacylglycerol kinase (41Veldhoven P.P.V. Matthews T.J. Bolognesi D.P. Bell R.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 209-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 42Perry D.K. Bielawska A. Hannun Y.A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 312: 22-31Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, the dried samples or purified bovine brain ceramide standards were solubilized in 20 μl of micelle buffer (7.5% (w/v) n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (Dojindo), 5 mm cardiolipin (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc), 1 mm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, and 10 mm imidazole, pH 6.6). The enzymatic reaction was started by adding 10 μl of 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi) in the presence of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer, pH 7.2, containing 50 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.050 units of purified diacylglycerol kinase (Calbiochem) in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Ceramide-1-[32P]phosphate was resolved by thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (65:15:5) as a solvent and quantified using a Fuji Bioimaging analyzer. The experiments were performed four times with separate cultures to confirm reproducibility. Representative data from neurons in a sister culture are shown in the figure. NGF Induced a Rapid Release of Glutamate in Cultured Cerebellar Neurons—To clarify the p75-dependent neurotransmitter release, we investigated the NGF-induced glutamate release in cultured cerebellar neurons that are known to lack TrkA, a specific receptor for NGF. First, we examined the dose-dependent effect of NGF on the glutamate release. As shown in Fig. 1A, NGF significantly induced the release of glutamate at high concentrations (50 or 100 ng/ml) although no release was triggered at 3 or 10 ng/ml. The vehicle alone (bovine serum albumin; 2 ng/ml) had no effect. The BDNF-induced release was marked at 3 or 10 ng/ml (43Numakawa T. Takei N. Yamagishi S. Sakai N. Hatanaka H. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), implying the involvement of the low affinity receptor p75 in the NGF-induced release. Previously (10Numakawa T. Matsumoto T. Adachi N. Yokomaku D. Kojima M. Takei N. Hatanaka H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 66: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Numakawa T. Yamagishi S. Adachi N. Matsumoto T. Yokomaku D. Yamada M. Hatanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6520-6529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we found that the BDNF-induced glutamate release occurred through the PLC-γ pathway following TrkB activation. Because the dose-dependence of NGF on the release was greater than that of BDNF, we further examined whether Trk receptors were involved in the NGF-induced release. In the presence of K252a, a Trks receptor inhibitor, BDNF did not induce any glutamate release, but NGF did, indicating that the NGF-induced release was not through Trks (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we confirmed the tyrosine phosphorylation of Trks stimulated by neurotrophins. Treatment with BDNF or NT-4/5 (100 ng/ml, respectively) for 30 s caused significant Trks phosphorylation whereas NGF (100 ng/ml for 30 s) had no effect (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that the glutamate release induced by NGF occurs through a Trk-independent pathway. A time course analysis of the NGF-induced release was also performed (Fig. 1D). Glutamate release was observed immediately after the application of NGF at 100 ng/ml and was maintained for 2–3 min. Overexpression of p75 Enhances NGF-induced Glutamate Release—To clarify the possibility of p75 involvement in the NGF-mediated glutamate release, we measured glutamate release in cerebellar neurons overexpressing p75. At 24 h after transfection with the adenovirus-mediated gene transfer system, the NGF-induced release in cultured cells that expressed either p75 at two different intensities (m.o.i. of 3 or 10) or lacZ alone (control, m.o.i. of 10) was measured. In this system, the NGF-induced glutamate release was enhanced in a p75 expression-dependent manner; that is, the release was greater in p75-overexpressing neurons than lacZ-transfected cells (Fig. 2, A and C). In contrast, the BDNF-induced release was not increased in the p75-overexpressing cultures (Fig. 2C). The intensity of p75 expression was confirmed by immunocytochemical analysis using two anti-p75 antibodies (Fig. 2B). The intensity of p75 expression depended on the m.o.i. of p75 adenovirus (a and b, m.o.i. of 10 (p75); c and d, m.o.i. of 3 (p75); e and f, m.o.i. of 10 (lacZ)). In addition, the level of p75 overexpression in the adenovirus-infected cultures was determined by Western analysis (Fig. 2B, g). The expression of TrkB or TUJ1 (a neuronal marker) was not changed by p75 overexpression. lacZ-infected cultures showed no change in endogenous p75 expression. In our culture, the p75 overexpression did not induce cell death within 24 h after the transfection (data not shown). Further, to reveal whether the NGF-dependent release was through p75, we tested the counteracting effect of the p75 antibody in untransfected cells. MC192 (p75 antibody) was known to inhibit the NGF-dependent biological effects on neuronal cultures (31Bui N.T. Konig H.G. Culmsee C. Bauerbach E. Poppe M. Krieglstein J. Prehn J.H. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 594-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 33Blochl A. Sirrenberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21100-21107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) although MC192 did not block NGF binding to p75 (44Chandler C.E. Parsons L.M. Hosang M. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6882-6889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was revealed that MC192 blocked the NGF-induced glutamate release (Fig. 2D). In contrast, the BDNF-induced release was not blocked by MC192. Heat-inactivated NGF did not trigger the release of glutamate (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, we examined the effect of p75-siRNA on the NGF-induced glutamate release. It was shown that endogenous p75 expression in Schwann cells was inhibited by p75-siRNA (37Higuchi H. Yamashita T. Yoshikawa H. Tohyama M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 301: 804-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The previous study (45Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11926-11929Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) described that siRNA could be readily introduced into cultured neurons. After transfection of p75-siRNA in this study, the NGF-induced release was reduced significantly (Fig. 2E, a). Scramble (control) siRNA-transfected cells still responded to NGF (Fig. 2E, a). We confirmed that the expression of endogenous p75 was significantly down-regulated by p75-siRNA transfection (Fig. 2E, b, None; 1.00 + 0.08, p75-siRNA; 0.54 + 0.10, ratio (per control), n = 3, quantification by densitometry). In contrast, the expression of endogenous TrkB was not changed (Fig. 2E, b). Although the degree of reduced p75 expression in the presence of p75-siRNA was about 50%, a complete loss of the NGF-induced glutamate release was observed, implying that there was a threshold in the p75 expression to activate the pathway downstream of p75. The effect of p75-siRNA on the BDNF-induced glutamate release was examined. An inhibitory influence on the BDNF-induced release was not observed (None; 2.57 ± 0.20, p75-siRNA; 2.72 ± 0.23, ratio (BDNF-induced/basal), n = 6, respectively). All these results strongly suggested that the NGF-induced release was p75-dependent. Intracellular Ca2 + Increase Derived from Ryanodine Receptors Was Essent"
https://openalex.org/W2098782264,"The mechanisms governing vascular smooth muscle tone are incompletely understood. In particular, the role of the sarcolemmal calcium pump PMCA (plasma membrane calmodulin-dependent calcium ATPase), which extrudes Ca2+ from the cytosol, and its importance compared with the sodium/calcium exchanger remain speculative. To test whether the PMCA is a regulator of vascular tone, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing the human PMCA4b under control of the arterial smooth muscle-specific SM22α promoter. This resulted in an elevated systolic blood pressure compared with littermate controls. In PMCA-overexpressing mice, endothelium-dependent relaxation of norepinephrine-preconstricted aortic rings to acetylcholine did not differ from wild type controls (76 ± 8% versus 79 ± 8% of maximum relaxation; n = 12, n.s.). De-endothelialized aortas of transgenic mice exhibited stronger maximum contraction to KCl (100 mmol/liter) compared with controls (86 ± 6% versus 68 ± 7% of reference KCl contraction at the beginning of the experiment; p <0.05). Preincubation of de-endothelialized vessels with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor l-NAME (l-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester) (10–5 mol/liter) resulted in a stronger contraction to KCl (p <0.05 versus without l-NAME), thus unmasking vasodilatory effects of inherent NO production. Maximum contraction to KCl after preincubation with l-NAME did not differ between PMCA mice and controls. In analogy to the results in PMCA-overexpressing mice, contractions of de-endothelialized aortas of neuronal NOS-deficient mice to KCl were significantly increased compared with controls (151 ± 5% versus 131 ± 6% of reference KCl contraction; p <0.05). In conclusion, our data suggest a model in which the sarcolemmal Ca2+ pump down-regulates activity of the vascular smooth muscle Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent neuronal NOS by a functionally relevant interaction. Therefore, the PMCA represents a novel regulator of vascular tone. The mechanisms governing vascular smooth muscle tone are incompletely understood.

Therefore, the PMCA represents a novel regulator of vascular tone. The epidemic of cardiovascular disease has led to a particular interest in the mechanisms governing contraction of the vasculature that determine the height of blood pressure in physiological adaptation (e.g. exercise) and in pathological states such as hypertension and heart failure. The contractile state of vascular smooth muscle cells is determined by tonic and phasic contractions brought about by a complex interplay of myosin light chain phosphorylation and intracellular calcium (reviewed in Refs. 1Pfitzer G. J. Appl. Physiol. 2001; 91: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar and 2Jaggar J.H. Wellman G.C. Heppner T.J. Porter V.A. Perez G.J. Gollasch M. Kleppisch T. Rubart M. Stevenson A.S.

Outward calcium transport across the plasma membrane is maintained by two transport systems, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and the plasma membrane calmodulin-dependent calcium ATPase (PMCA). 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane calmodulin-dependent calcium ATPase; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; l-NAME, l-N(G) nitroarginine methyl ester; n.s., not significant; SM, smooth muscle.1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane calmodulin-dependent calcium ATPase; NOS, nitric oxide synthase; nNOS, neuronal NOS; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; l-NAME, l-N(G) nitroarginine methyl ester; n.s., not significant; SM, smooth muscle. The Na+/Ca2+ exchanger has high and the PMCA relatively low capacity for calcium transport. Initially, it had been assumed that the exchanger has much lower Ca2+ affinity than the PMCA, but this has been disputed (pump properties are summarized in Refs. 3Carafoli E. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 129-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 4Carafoli E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 531-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 5Strehler E.E. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 283-295PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the physiological role of the PMCA in excitable tissues that express relatively high amounts of exchanger protein has remained somewhat unclear. Four isoforms of the pump have been described, two of which (i.e. 1 and 4) are prominently expressed in peripheral extraneuronal tissues. The PMCA itself has also been shown to be a target for post-translational modifications, e.g. phosphorylation by protein kinase A or focal adhesion kinase, influencing the activity of the pump (6Neyses L.

Haemostasis. 2003; 89: 122-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, it was suggested that the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump itself may be regulated by cyclic GMP and protein kinase C in vascular smooth muscle cells (9Furukawa K. Tawada Y. Shigekawa M. J.

In an attempt to define the role of the PMCA in smooth muscle cell proliferation, Husain et al. (11Husain M. Jiang L. See V. Bein K. Simons M. Alper S.L. Rosenberg R.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1947-C1959Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) observed regulation of PMCA1 and PMCA4 mRNA transcription during cell cycle progression in vascular smooth muscle cells and showed that transient PMCA overexpression reduces the cell proliferation rate more than 2.5-fold. In recent years, our group has developed the hypothesis that the PMCA in skeletal and heart muscle plays a more significant role in signal transduction than in regulation of calcium subserving contraction/excitation coupling (12Hammes A. Oberdorf-Maass S. Rother T. Nething K. Gollnick F. Linz K.W. Meyer R. Hu K. Han H. Gaudron P. Ertl G. Hoffmann S. Ganten U. Vetter R. Schuh K. Benkwitz C. Zimmer H.G. Neyses L. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, a specific mechanism by which isoform 4b (also termed 4CI) of the pump exerts a regulatory role has been identified. PMCA4b has a C-terminal ligand for PDZ domains (13Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol.

Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Rothlein N. Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In the present work, using transgenic overexpression of PMCA4b under the control of the highly vascular-specific SM22 α promoter (17Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13460-13469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we begin to define the role of the PMCA in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell tone. In integrated physiological systems, vascular tone translates into blood pressure, and it was therefore of particular interest to investigate whether the PMCA might be a potential candidate for blood pressure regulation. Generation of PMCA4b Transgenic Mice—To generate transgenic mice, the smooth muscle-specific SM22α promoter (Ref. 17Solway J. Seltzer J. Samaha F.F. Kim S. Alger L.E. Niu Q. Morrisey E.E. Ip H.S.

Parmacek, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) was cloned into a vector backbone containing the human PMCA4b cDNA (accession number NM_001684) and an SV40 polyadenylation signal, as described before (12Hammes A. Oberdorf-Maass S. Rother T. Nething K. Gollnick F. Linz K.W. Meyer R. Hu K. Han H. Gaudron P. Ertl G. Hoffmann S. Ganten U. Vetter R. Schuh K. Benkwitz C. Zimmer H.G. Neyses L. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Six transgenic founders were obtained after standard pronucleus injection procedure; five of them gave rise to transgenic strains expressing the hPMCA4b in various artery smooth muscles of different organs. The cell line 1505.5, showing the most ubiquitous expression in smooth muscles of the vascular system, and non-transgenic littermates were used for this study. nNOS knock-out mice B6129S-Nos1tm1Plh and the appropriate controls B6129SF2/J (“nNOS controls”) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine. The study design and the experimental protocols were conducted according to the local institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and are in accordance with the American Heart Association guidelines for research animal use. Verification of Transgene Integration and Maintenance of Transgenic Lines—Integration of the used construct was verified by Southern blotting and PCR assays using tail biopsy samples. For Southern blotting assays, the human PMCA4b cDNA was used as probe. For routine use, the following human PMCA4b-specific primers were used in standard PCR assays: forward, GGCTCCCTGAGTGTACTCCC; reverse, CCTGATGACGGTGCTCATTG. Offspring of founders were mated to C57Bl/6 mice. Experiments were done after >4 inbred generations to C57Bl/6 background. To avoid possible insertion effects of the transgene, only transgenic mice and their littermates were used for these experiments. Verification of Transgene Expression—Expression of transgene was tested on the mRNA level by RT-PCR and on the protein level by Western blotting and immunohistological staining. Interaction of PMCA4b with nNOS was verified by co-immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blotting. RT-PCR was done using 2 μg of total RNA of the corresponding organ in standard reactions using the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen one-step RT-PCR kit, Qiagen) and the hPMCA4b-specific primers (see above). Expression of PMCA4b in aorta and interaction of nNOS with PMCA4 were detected by precipitation of PMCA4b-containing complexes and subsequent Western blotting. In brief, aortas of four transgenic and four control mice were pooled, lysed in RIPA buffer (PBS containing 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) by Dounce homogenization. After sedimentation of cellular debris and an initial preclearing step, aorta lysates containing 300 μg of protein were incubated with 5 μl of anti-PMCA4 serum (SWANT) or 5 μg of monoclonal mouse anti-human PMCA4b antibody (clone JA3; Neomarkers) or 5 μg of irrelevant antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. PMCA4-containing complexes were precipitated with a mixture of 50 μl of protein A- and G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) in each sample. After incubation, the samples were washed three times with RIPA buffer, once with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, boiled in SDS sample buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (polyclonal anti-PMCA4 serum, 1:500, SWANT; monoclonal anti-nNOS antibodies, catalogue number N41520, 1:250, Transduction Laboratories). After four washes with PBS-T, membranes were incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibodies for 1 h and subsequently washed several times with PBS-T. Proteins were detected with the ECL™ detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To show expression of transgenic human PMCA4b in smooth muscle cells of the cardiovascular system in mice, we used a polyclonal rabbit antibody, raised against a peptide consisting of the last 15 amino acid residues of human PMCA4b: LPQSDSSLQSLETSV. Endogenous PMCA4 in vascular smooth muscle cells of wild type mice was stained with a PMCA4-specific polyclonal antiserum (SWANT), cross-reactive with mouse tissue (18Stauffer T.P. Guerini D. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12184-12190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To stain for nNOS in mouse smooth muscle cells, we used the polyclonal rabbit anti-nNOS antiserum (catalogue number PA3-032A), diluted 1:500; Affinity Bioreagents. Tissue sections were prepared according to Ref. 19Segal S.S. Brett S.E. Sessa W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1167-H1177PubMed Google Scholar. After blocking in PBS/10% goat serum, sections were incubated overnight with primary antibodies in blocking buffer in a humid chamber at 4 °C and were then washed five times in PBS. The sections were incubated with secondary antibodies (Cy3-conjugated AffiniPure goat anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1:1000; Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 h at room temperature in a dark chamber, followed by another five washing steps. Smooth muscle cells were counterstained with a FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4, catalogue number F3777; Sigma). Stained sections were embedded in Mowiol containing 2.5% DABCO (1,4-Diazabicyclo(2.2.2)octane) and photographed after 16 h using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 microscope. An overlay of the pictures was made using Adobe Photoshop software. Hemodynamics—Hemodynamic measurements were carried out under inhalatory isofluran anesthesia. Mice were placed on a heated board to maintain body temperature at 37 °C, intubated, and connected with a rodent respirator (Harvard Apparatus). The Millar® catheter (1.4 F, model SPR671) was inserted into the right carotid artery for hemodynamic measurements. The catheter was placed into the aorta and left ventricle for respective measurements under light anesthesia. Tissue Harvesting—Anesthetized mice (pentobarbital, 40 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) were euthanized by cervical dislocation. The aorta was isolated in no-touch technique, removed, and placed immediately into cold (4 °C) modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (in mmol/liter): NaCl 118.6, KCl 4.7, CaCl2 2.5, MgSO4 1.2, KH2PO4 1.2, NaHCO3 25.1, EDTA 0.026, and glucose 10.1. Under a microscope, vessels were rinsed with a cannula to remove residual blood cells, cleaned of adherent tissue, and cut into rings 3 mm long. Organ Chamber Experiments—Aortic rings were suspended to fine tungsten stir-ups (diameter 50 μm), placed in an organ bath filled with 10 ml of Krebs solution, and connected to force transducers (Fo̧hr Medical Instruments, Seeheim, Germany) for isometric tension recording as described before (20Quaschning T. d'Uscio L.V. Shaw S. Luscher T.F. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 1108-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). After an equilibration period of 60 min, the rings were progressively stretched to their optimal passive tension (2.0 ± 0.2 g) as assessed by the response to 100 mmol/liter KCl in modified Krebs solution (21Barton M. d'Uscio L.V. Shaw S. Meyer P. Moreau P. Luscher T.F. Hypertension. 1998; 31: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Rings were preconstricted with norepinephrine (10–8 to 10–7 mmol/liter, ∼70% of KCl 100 mmol/liter), and relaxations to acetylcholine (10–10-10–5 mol/liter) or sodium nitroprusside (10–11-10–5 mol/liter) were obtained. In additional experiments, the endothelium was removed by gentle rubbing, and its absence was confirmed by the lack of relaxation to acetylcholine (3 × 10–6 mol/liter). In de-endothelialized aortic rings, cumulative concentration-response curves to KCl (1–100 mmol/liter)were obtained with and without 30 min of preincubation of the NOS inhibitor l-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 3 × 10–5 mol/liter), respectively. All chemical substances and drugs used in this study were purchased from Sigma. Calculations and Statistical Analysis—Relaxations to agonists in isolated vessels are given as percentage of preconstriction in rings preconstricted with norepinephrine to about 70% of contraction induced by reference KCl (100 mmol/liter) for each vessel ring. The contractions were expressed as a percentage of 100 mmol/liter KCl-induced reference contractions, which were obtained at the beginning of every experiment for each ring. Results are presented as mean ± S.E. In all experiments, n equals the number of mice per experiment. From each individual mouse three aortic rings were tested and obtained values combined. For statistical analysis, the sensitivity of the vessels to the drugs was expressed as the negative logarithm of the concentration that caused half-maximal relaxation or contraction (pD2). Maximal relaxation (expressed as a percentage of preconstriction) or contraction was determined for each individual concentration-response curve by nonlinear regression analysis using MatLab software (Math Works Inc., Natick, MA). For comparison between two values, the unpaired t test or the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used when appropriate. For multiple comparisons, results were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's correction (22Wallenstein S. Zucker C.L. Fleiss J.L. Circ. Res. 1980; 47: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated by linear regression. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. Expression of Transgenic hPMCA4b in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells—General tissue-specific transgene expression on the RNA level was determined by RT-PCR. As expected for a transgene driven by a vascular promoter, the transgenic mouse line used in this study (named 1505.5) showed ubiquitous expression in all tested organs (Fig. 1B). Mouse lines showing expression only in a subgroup of organs were not used for further experiments (not shown). On the protein level, as determined in Western blotting experiments, the transgenic mouse line 1505.5 showed expression in liver, aorta, heart, lung, kidney, and skeletal muscle, destining this line for further studies on the role of PMCA4b in mechanisms regulating blood pressure. In some Western blots a variable migration behavior of the transgenic protein was observed, most likely because of different phosphorylation states of the protein. To ascertain that the expression of the transgene was restricted to vascular smooth muscle cells, co-immunostaining was performed and restriction of transgene expression to vascular smooth muscles was demonstrated by staining with an antiserum generated against the C terminus of the human PMCA4b and counter-staining with directly FITC-labeled smooth muscle α-actin-specific antibodies (Fig. 2). Stained sections of aorta, skeletal muscle, kidney, and liver (not shown) revealed restricted expression pattern in vascular smooth muscles and strict co-expression with smooth muscle α-actin (Fig. 2). Elevated Blood Pressure—Mice overexpressing the PMCA4b in vascular smooth muscles showed an ∼10 mm Hg increase in left ventricular systolic pressure (Fig. 3). The elevated blood pressure most likely reflects the higher muscular tone of the vascular smooth muscles in the PMCA-overexpressing mice. Expression of nNOS and Interaction of nNOS with PMCA4 in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells—To test the hypothesis that the in vivo changes in blood pressure may be because of interaction of PMCA4b and NOS as described previously by us (16Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Rothlein N. Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we looked for co-expression and interaction of nNOS and endogenous PMCA4 in vascular smooth muscle cells. Endogenous PMCA4 staining was observed in sections of various organs. As an example, staining of wild type aorta with a mouse PMCA4-recognizing antibody is shown in Fig. 4. nNOS expression in vascular smooth muscle cells was observed in all mouse tissue sections investigated. As an example, nNOS expression in control mouse aorta is shown in Fig. 5, A–F. These results confirm previously published reports showing nNOS expression in vascular smooth muscle cells of hamsters (19Segal S.S. Brett S.E. Sessa W.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1167-H1177PubMed Google Scholar) and extend it to mouse tissues. Physical interaction of PMCA4 and nNOS was tested by co-immunoprecipitation. nNOS was co-precipitated by PMCA4-specific antibodies from wild type and transgenic aorta lysate (Fig. 5G), demonstrating interaction of proteins in vascular smooth muscles. Interaction of endogenous nNOS with transgenic hPMCA4b was detected in co-precipitation assays using the human PMCA4b-specific antibody JA3 to precipitate the hPMCA4b- and nNOS-containing complex. Typically, we observed an ∼2–3-fold overexpression of PMCA4b on the protein level in transgenic animals. A representative example of expressed and precipitated total PMCA4 is given in Fig. 5G (left panel), suggesting a physiologically relevant level of overexpression. Taken together, these results provide evidence for co-expression and interaction of transgenic hPMCA4b, the endogenous PMCA and nNOS in vascular smooth muscle cells. Endothelium-dependent Relaxation—To evaluate the impact of PMCA on the regulation of vascular tone, endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation was evaluated in preconstricted aortic rings. In PMCA4b transgenic animals, endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine did not differ from wild type littermates (76 ± 8% versus 79 ± 8% for maximum relaxation, n.s., Fig. 6A). In nNOS knock-out mice, maximum endothelium-dependent relaxation was impaired compared with control mice, thus reflecting some impact of nNOS-derived NO on endothelium-dependent relaxation (Fig. 6B), whereas acetylcholine concentration of half-maximal relaxation (pD2) was similar in nNOS knock-out mice and nNOS controls (4.8 × 10–8 mol/liter versus 5.2 × 10–8 mol/liter acetylcholine, n.s., Fig. 6). Endothelium-independent Relaxation—Endothelium-independent relaxation to the NO donor sodium nitroprusside was similar in PMCA transgenic mice and their wild type littermates (n.s., Fig. 7A) and in nNOS knock-out mice as compared with their corresponding nNOS controls (n.s., Fig. 7B), demonstrating that signaling pathways downstream the NO production remained unaltered in both PMCA transgenic and nNOS knock-out mice. Concentration-dependent Contraction to Potassium Chloride (KCl)—De-endothelialized aortic rings of PMCA transgenic mice exhibited increased maximum contraction to KCl as compared with their wild type littermates (86 ± 6% versus 68 ± 7% of reference KCl contraction; p < 0.05; Fig. 8A). In vitro preincubation of de-endothelialized vessel rings with the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (10–5 mol/liter) resulted in a marked increase in contraction to KCl (p < 0.05 versus the corresponding group without l-NAME preincubation; Fig. 8A), thus unmasking vasodilatory effects of underlying NO production. Maximum contraction to KCl after preincubation with l-NAME did not differ between PMCA transgenic animals and their wild type littermates (111 ± 7% versus 105 ± 7% of reference KCl contraction, respectively; n.s.; Fig. 8A), which indicates that in PMCA transgenic mice basal NO production may be reduced. In keeping with the results in PMCA transgenic mice, contractions of de-endothelialized aortic rings of nNOS knock-out mice to KCl were significantly elevated compared with their nNOS controls (151 ± 5% versus 131 ± 6% of reference KCl contraction; p < 0.05; Fig. 8B), thus demonstrating the vasodilatory role of nNOS-derived NO. The present results provide the first insight into the hitherto unknown function of the sarcolemmal calcium pump PMCA in the vascular system. In transgenic mice overexpressing isoform 4b (also named CI) of the pump in the vasculature, we found 1) an increase in blood pressure, 2) unaltered endothelium-dependent relaxation, and 3) increased vascular contraction in response to depolarization. These results were supported by pharmacological inhibition of NO synthesis as well as in nNOS-deficient mice. These alterations are likely because of reduced generation of nitric oxide and related to regulation of NO synthase I by the PMCA via physical interaction of the two enzymes. Hence, the PMCA is a novel candidate in the gamut of molecules regulating vascular tone. At first glance, our results may seem surprising. Superficially, a pump ejecting calcium from the cytosol would be assumed to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation and hence a fall in blood pressure. The idea that anomalies in calcium regulation bear an intimate relationship to the regulation of blood pressure has been a major school of thought in the field of hypertension. Blaustein's hypothesis states that the sodium electrochemical gradient across the sarcolemmal membrane plays a critical role in cellular calcium regulation. Any change in the sodium gradient will then, presumably by an Na+/Ca2+ exchange mechanism, be reflected as a change in free intracellular Ca2+ and, therefore, as a change in vessel wall tension (23Blaustein M.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 232: C165-C173Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). The importance of the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger has been demonstrated recently (24Wakimoto K. Kobayashi K. Kuro O.M. Yao A.

Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Why then, should overexpression of the sarcolemmal calcium pump PMCA in vascular smooth muscle cells lead to an increase in contractility and blood pressure? Over several years and using several independent experimental approaches, we have provided evidence for our hypothesis that the PMCA is involved in the regulation of signal transduction rather than direct regulation of contraction (12Hammes A. Oberdorf-Maass S. Rother T. Nething K. Gollnick F. Linz K.W. Meyer R. Hu K. Han H. Gaudron P. Ertl G. Hoffmann S. Ganten U. Vetter R. Schuh K. Benkwitz C. Zimmer H.G. Neyses L. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In support of our hypothesis, we have shown that the pump is involved in skeletal muscle differentiation (28Hammes A. Oberdorf S. Strehler E.E. Stauffer T. Carafoli E. Vetter H. Neyses L. FASEB. J. 1994; 8: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 29Hammes A. Oberdorf-Maass S. Jenatschke S. Pelzer T. Maass A.

Oberdorf-Maass S. Rother T. Nething K. Gollnick F. Linz K.W. Meyer R. Hu K. Han H. Gaudron P. Ertl G. Hoffmann S. Ganten U. Vetter R. Schuh K. Benkwitz C. Zimmer H.G. Neyses L. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 877-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Recently, based on the finding of Strehler and co-workers that isoform 4b (CI) of the pump carries a C-terminal peptide sequence able to bind to PDZ protein domains (13Kim E. DeMarco S.J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Sheng M. Strehler E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1591-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we have been able to show that this major isoform binds to the PDZ domain of nNOS and regulates it through its Ca2+/calmodulin dependence. Increasing the activity of the PMCA depletes Ca2+ in the vicinity of nNOS and hence down-regulates its activity; this regulation has functional relevance in cellular cGMP physiology (16Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Rothlein N. Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Previously published results (30Lau K.S. Grange R.W. Isotani E. Sarelius I.H. Kamm K.E. Huang P.L. Stull J.T. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) describing an nNOS- and cGMP-dependent response of fast-twitch skeletal muscle are in line with our observations. The present study extends this concept to the vasculature. We show that nNOS and PMCA are colocalized in vascular smooth muscle sarcolemma. Additionally, physical interaction of the two proteins in lysates of aorta was shown here. In contrast to the wild type situation, NOS inhibition by l-NAME had no effect in endothelialized vessels overexpressing PMCA, in keeping with our previous in vitro finding that increasing PMCA down-regulates nNOS activity (16Schuh K. Uldrijan S. Telkamp M. Rothlein N. Neyses L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).

Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 849-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and the specificity of interaction with PMCA variants and isoforms in different organs remain to be clarified. Our results (as shown in Fig. 5G) suggest specific preference of interaction of nNOSα variants with certain PMCA variants. Post-translational modification, e.g. phosphorylation (6Neyses L. Reinlib L.

Chem. 1997; 272: 23741-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), may account for different migration patterns and specific interactions with certain nNOS splice variants. C-terminal truncation of PMCA4b, as previously described to occur in brain tissues (32Filoteo G.A. Elwess N.L. Enyedi A. Caride A. Aung H.H. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23741-23747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), may also be responsible for the lack of signals in certain organs (e.g. small intestine) because the antibody was generated against the last 15 amino acid residues of hPMCA4b. In summary, we here show that the sarcolemmal calcium pump is capable of regulating vascular tone and blood pressure in a whole animal model, and we propose a potential mechanism of action, i.e. regulation of vascular smooth muscle nNOS. Gros, Husain, and co-workers (33Gros R. Afroze T. You X.-M. Kabir G. Van Wert R. Kalair W. Hoque A.E. Mungrue I.N. Husain M. Circ. Res. 2003; 93 (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) observed an almost identical 10 mm Hg elevation of blood pressure in an inducible, smooth muscle-specific PMCA4b-overexpressing mouse model, attesting to the robust influence of the PMCA and virtually excluding any major effect of transgene insertion. It will be revealing to identify other interaction partners of the pump and to characterize the vascular phenotype of PMCA knock-out models in the future. These results place the sarcolemmal calcium pump in the group of candidate genes for the polymorphic trait of blood pressure. We are thankful to Dr. Annette Hammes for initiating this study and Michael D. Parmacek for providing the SM22α promoter."

This protein, designated Mpp1p, belongs to the family of Zn(II)2Cys6 proteins.

Also, upon induction of mpp1 cells on methanol, the number of peroxisomes was strongly reduced relative to wild type cells and generally amounted to one organelle per cell. Remarkably, this single organelle was not susceptible to selective peroxisome degradation (pexophagy) and remained unaffected during exposure of methanol-induced cells to excess glucose conditions. We show that this mechanism is a general phenomenon in H. polymorpha in the case of cells that contain only a single peroxisome.

We show that this mechanism is a general phenomenon in H. polymorpha in the case of cells that contain only a single peroxisome. Eukaryotic cells are thought to have evolved ∼1.5 billion years ago. The development of cell organelles allowed primitive eukaryotes to compartmentalize specific cellular functions. Concomitantly, genetic mechanisms that control the biogenesis and function of these compartments had to be developed. Obviously, the separate classes of organelles are characterized by their specific function, as in energy metabolism (mitochondrion), degradation processes (vacuole, lysosome), or protein transport (Golgi system, endoplasmatic reticulum). Among the organelles, peroxisomes are remarkable because of their highly versatile functions most of which are related to specific metabolic pathways in the organism in which they occur. This functional flexibility is not reflected in their morphology. The organelles are invariably very simple of construction and consist of a proteinaceous matrix, surrounded by a single membrane. Nevertheless, their function varies from the oxidation of very long chain fatty acids in man, germination of oil-bearing seed and photorespiration in green plants, to the metabolism of unusual carbon and/or nitrogen sources in fungi (1van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B. Wanders R.J. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). In the methylotrophic yeast Hansenula polymorpha peroxisomes are essential to support growth of cells on media containing methanol as the sole source of carbon and energy. Under these conditions many organelles that contain the key enzymes involved in methanol metabolism, alcohol oxidase (AO), 1The abbreviations used are: AO, alcohol oxidase; DHAS, dihydroxyacetone synthase; WT, wild type; ORF, open reading frame; GFP, green fluorescent protein. dihydroxyacetone synthase (DHAS), and catalase, develop in the cells. Conversely, when methanol-grown wild type (WT) cells are shifted to conditions in which the organelles are redundant for growth (e.g. glucose), they are rapidly and sequentially degraded by a process designated pexophagy (reviewed in Ref. 2Bellu A.R. Kiel J.A.K.W. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 61: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Morphological data suggest that in each cell generally a single (or few) small peroxisome(s) escape(s) the degradation process. The resistance of these organelles to degradation is thought to be of physiological advantage in that it allows the cells to quickly adapt to new environments that require new peroxisome functions. In the present work, we report the identification of a novel H. polymorpha transcription factor, Mpp1p, which is involved in the regulation of peroxisomal proteins. In H. polymorpha mpp1 cells, various peroxisomal matrix enzymes involved in methanol metabolism and proteins essential for peroxisome biogenesis (peroxins) are present at reduced levels. As a result, mpp1 cells cannot grow on methanol as the sole source of carbon and energy. Interestingly, methanol-induced mpp1 cells generally contained a single enlarged peroxisome. Remarkably, these single organelles are protected from selective degradation upon exposure of cells to excess glucose.

The genomic regions of pANL7 and pREMI-59 were initially sequenced using vector-based primers (4van Dijk R. Faber K.N. Hammond A.T. Glick B.S. Veenhuis M. Kiel J.A.K.W. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2001; 266: 646-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis showed that the pREMI-Z vector had integrated in mutants mpp1-1 and mpp1-2 at two different locations in the same gene that was designated MPP1. Subsequently, the entire nucleotide sequence of the MPP1 gene was determined by primer walking on the rescued pREMI-Z plasmids. The nucleotide sequence of the MPP1 gene was deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AY190521). To clone the MPP1 open reading frame, mutant mpp1-1 was transformed with a H. polymorpha genomic library constructed in the pYT3 vector (5Tan X. Waterham H.R. Veenhuis M. Cregg J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Leucine prototrophic transformants were screened on YNM plates for the ability to grow on methanol. From a complementing plasmid, a sub-clone containing a 3.4-kb PstI-NheI fragment with the entire MPP1 gene was obtained, designated pANL26, that was used for complementation studies. Construction of an H. polymorpha MPP1 Null Mutant—A strain deleted for MPP1 was constructed by replacing the region of MPP1 comprising nucleotides +1 to +1042 by an auxotrophic marker. To this end, a deletion cassette was constructed as follows. First, two DNA fragments comprising the regions -816 to -1 and +1042 to +1841 of the MPP1 genomic region were obtained by PCR, using primers MPP1del-1 + MPP1del-2 and MPP1del-3 + MPP1del-4, respectively (see Table III). After restriction with NotI + BglII and PstI + Asp718I, respectively, the resulting fragments were inserted upstream and downstream of the H. polymorpha URA3 gene (6Merckelbach A. Godecke S. Janowicz Z.A. Hollenberg C.P. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1993; 40: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in pBSK-URA3. From the resulting plasmid, designated pANL17, a 2650-bp BamHI-PvuI fragment was used to transform H. polymorpha NCYC495 leu1.1 ura3. Uracil prototrophic transformants were selected by their inability to grow on YNM plates. Proper deletion of MPP1 was confirmed by Southern blotting (data not shown).

Subsequently, the resulting plasmid, designated pANL29, was linearized with SphI and integrated in the mpp1 genome. Zeocin-resistant transformants were analyzed for correct integration in the PAOX region by Southern blotting (data not shown). A strain containing a single copy of the integrated plasmid, designated mpp1.eGFP.SKL, was used for further studies. Construction of a Strain Expressing an MPP1.eGFP Fusion Gene—To enable replacement of the genomic MPP1 gene by a MPP1.eGFP fusion gene, we first constructed plasmid pANL31. This plasmid is based on the pBluescript vector and contains an eGFP gene, lacking its start codon, and the zeocin resistance cassette. Subsequently, a 749bp Hin-dIII-BamHI PCR fragment containing the 3′ end of the MPP1 gene lacking its stop codon (comprising the region +1306 to +2052 of MPP1), obtained using primers MPP1-Ori2 and MPP1w/oStop (Table III), was inserted in HindIII/BglII-digested pANL31. The resulting plasmid, designated pANL32, was linearized with EcoRI in the MPP1 region and transformed to WT H. polymorpha NCYC495 leu 1.1. Zeocin-resistant colonies were analyzed by Southern blotting to confirm correct integration in the MPP1 region (data not shown). Miscellaneous DNA Techniques—Plasmids and primers used in this study are listed in Tables II and III, respectively. All DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard techniques (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed.

Pwo polymerase was used for preparative PCR. The ECL direct nucleic acid labeling and detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used for Southern blot analysis. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. DNA sequencing reactions were performed at BaseClear (Leiden, The Netherlands) using a LiCor automated DNA sequencer and dye primer chemistry (LiCor, Lincoln, NB).

Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar) were performed by established methods. The degradation of peroxisomes in batch cultures of H. polymorpha was determined as described (18Titorenko V.I. Keizer I. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 357-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Relative AO levels were determined by densitometric scanning of Western blots decorated with specific antibodies against AO. The decrease in AO levels during peroxisome degradation is expressed as a percentage of the initial value, which is arbitrarily set to 100%. β-Lactamase activities were assayed by established methods (19Waterham H.R.

Morphological Analysis—Intact cells were prepared for electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry as described previously (19Waterham H.R. Titorenko V.I. Haima P. Cregg J.M. Harder W. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 737-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy studies were performed using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany). Nuclear staining was performed as follows: 20-40 OD660 units of cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of fresh medium supplemented with 40 μl of a 2.7 mg/ml Hoechst 33258 stock solution, and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min prior to analysis. Mpp1p Is a Member of the Zn(II) 2 Cys 6 Cluster Protein Family and Is Induced during Growth of H. polymorpha on Methanol— From a collection of 5,000 RALF transformants, mutants were selected that were impaired in growth on methanol as sole carbon source (Mut-phenotype). Two mutants, designated mpp1-1 and mpp1-2, were identified of identical morphological phenotype. Characteristically, upon growth in glycerol/methanol-containing media, conditions that lead to a strong peroxisome development in WT cells, generally a single peroxisome was observed in the vast majority of the mpp1-1 and mpp1-2 cells (Fig. 1). Sequencing of the plasmids recovered from these mutants revealed that the flanking regions were overlapping. Hence, both were apparently disturbed in the function of the same gene, termed MPP1 (methylotrophic peroxisomal protein regulator 1). Further sequencing of the plasmids recovered from mutants mpp1-1 and mpp1-2 allowed the determination of the remainder of the MPP1 open reading frame (ORF). Sequence analysis indicated that in case of mutant mpp1-1, the integration of the pREMI-Z plasmid had occurred 456 bp downstream from the initiation of the MPP1 ORF. In mutant mpp1-2, pREMI-Z had inserted at the promoter region of the same ORF (nucleotide -195). The sequence upstream the 5′ region of this ORF comprised the 3′ end of the H. polymorpha dihydroxyacetone synthase gene (DAS; see Fig. 2A).Fig. 2The H. polymorpha MPP1 gene. A, schematic representation of the genomic region comprising the H. polymorpha MPP1 gene. The strategy to disrupt MPP1 by homologous recombination is presented. The integration sites of pREMI-Z in the mpp1-1 and mpp1-2 mutants are also indicated. Only relevant restriction sites are shown. B, alignment of the N termini of Mpp1p and other characteristic yeast Zn(II)2Cys6 proteins. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of S. cerevisiae Gal4p (SwissProt accession number P04386; amino acids 1-58), Pip2p (SwissProt accession number P52960; amino acids 1-72), and Pdr3p (SwissProt accession number P33200; amino acids 1-61) were aligned with that of H. polymorpha Mpp1p (amino acids 1-75) using the ClustalX program. The one-letter code is shown. Gaps were introduced to maximize the similarity. Residues that are similar in all four proteins are shaded black, those that are similar in three of the proteins are shaded dark gray, and those that are similar in two of the four proteins are shaded light gray.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The MPP1 gene encodes a protein of 684 amino acids. A BLASTP search revealed that the N-terminal region of Mpp1p is similar to that of many DNA-binding proteins. However, a true homologue was not found in the available databases. Further analysis using the ScanPROSITE program revealed that Mpp1p is a putative member of the Zn(II)2Cys6 family of transcription factors. These transcription regulators are exclusively detected in fungi and contain a well conserved DNA binding domain (20Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This domain consists of a cystein-rich motif (CysX 2CysX 6CysX 6CysX 2CysX 6Cys) that complexes two Zn2+ ions and in most cases recognizes a pair of 5′-CGG-3′ triplets in the promoters of target genes (20Schjerling P. Holmberg S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4599-4607Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 21Pan T. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2077-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A primary sequence comparison of the region comprising the DNA binding domain of characteristic Zn(II)2Cys6 proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the putative DNA binding domain of Mpp1p is depicted in Fig. 2B. The subcellular location of Mpp1p in H. polymorpha was studied in a strain in which the endogenous MPP1 gene was replaced by a MPP1.eGFP fusion gene. The presence of the C-terminal tag most likely did not interfere with Mpp1p function, because the resulting strain, MPP1.eGFP, grew normally on glucose and methanol (data not shown). In MPP1.eGFP cells grown on glucose, GFP fluorescence was invariably undetectable, independent of the growth stage. However, upon a shift of glucose-grown cell to fresh methanol-containing media, GFP fluorescence was readily observed as a single dot at all growth phases. This spot was observed in the same region of the cells as Hoechst 33258, which is a nuclear stain. These findings therefore indicate that Mpp1p is associated with the nucleus (Fig. 3). Cells of the MPP1 Deletion Strain Generally Contain a Single Peroxisome—For construction of a MPP1 deletion strain, we replaced a 1042-bp fragment from the MPP1 open reading frame by the H. polymorpha URA3 gene (Fig. 2A). Cells of the mpp1 strain and the original RALF mutants, mpp1-1 and mpp1-2, showed identical phenotypes. Mpp1 cells were unable to grow on methanol as sole carbon source and, when grown on glycerol/methanol mixtures, characteristically contained a single peroxisome (Fig. 4B). Reintroduction of the MPP1 gene from an autonomously replicating plasmid (pANL26) restored normal growth of mpp1 cells on methanol, as well as normal peroxisome proliferation (Fig. 4C). In crude extracts of glycerol/methanol-grown WT and mpp1 cells, the levels of the peroxisomal matrix protein AO were strongly reduced, whereas DHAS, another peroxisomal matrix enzyme, could not be detected (Fig. 5A). However, catalase was present at approximately WT levels. Also the levels of malate synthase, a peroxisomal key enzyme of glyoxylate (C2) metabolism (22Bruinenberg P.G. Blaauw M. Kazemier B. AB G. Yeast. 1990; 6: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), did not change significantly under the conditions tested (Fig. 5A). In addition, the level of various peroxins that play a role in peroxisome formation was analyzed. All were present at significantly reduced levels (Pex3p, Pex5p, Pex10p) with the exception of Pex14p (Fig. 5B). Cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase levels were normal. To test whether the observed lower protein levels were because of decreased expression or increased protein degradation, we analyzed the promoter activities of the AOX (PAOX) and PEX3 (PPEX3) genes in WT and mpp1 cells using β-lactamase as a reporter (19Waterham H.R.

As shown in Fig. 5C, the activities of both promoters are significantly reduced in mpp1 cells compared with WT controls. Despite the low peroxisome numbers we did not observe a defect in matrix protein import in mpp1 cells. GFP.SKL was solely observed in spots (compare Fig. 4B), and immunocyto-chemistry revealed that anti-alcohol oxidase and anti-catalase-dependent-specific labeling was confined to the peroxisomal profiles (Fig. 4D), indicating that these proteins were incorporated in their correct target organelle. As expected, using antidihydroxyacetone synthase antibodies, specific labeling was not detected (not shown). Single Peroxisomes in H. polymorpha Cells Are Not Susceptible to Glucose-induced Selective Peroxisome Degradation (Pexophagy)—In methanol-grown WT H. polymorpha cells peroxisomes are rapidly degraded when they have become redundant for growth (24Veenhuis M. Douma A. Harder W. Osumi M. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 193-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To analyze the fate of the single organelles in mpp1 cells, glycerol/methanol-grown cells of this strain were exposed to excess glucose conditions. In the first 2 h after the shift of cells, no significant AO protein degradation had occurred in mpp1 cells, as judged from Western blots (Fig. 6, A and B). In mpp1.eGFP.SKL cells, fluorescence microscopy studies failed to demonstrate the uptake of the fluorescent reporter protein in vacuoles, a phenomenon that was readily observed in WT controls (Fig. 6C). Also, electron microscopically we were never able to detect peroxisome sequestration, the typical initial event of pexophagy in H. polymorpha (not shown). To further substantiate the possibility that also in WT cells specific organelles escape the pexophagy process, we have grown H. polymorpha WT cells on methanol to a phase that they generally contain only one or two organelles per cell (early exponential growth; see Ref. 25Veenhuis M. Keizer I. Harder W. Arch. Microbiol. 1979; 120: 167-175Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and studied pexophagy relative to cells that were in the mid-exponential growth phase and contained several peroxisomes. The results clearly show that the single peroxisome present in early exponential WT cells is not degraded within a period of 4 h after exposure of the cells to excess glucose (Fig. 7C). In contrast, in mid-exponential cells a rapid reduction of peroxisome numbers was observed. Nevertheless, in these cells generally a single fluorescent spot remained indicating that not all peroxisomes were degraded (Fig. 7C). Remarkably, the morphological phenotypes of early and mid-exponential WT cells after 4 h of exposure of cells to glucose was indistinguishable in that they generally contained a single fluorescent spot. Most likely, solely small organelles remain unaffected as was evident after careful electron microscopical observations (Fig. 4E). These observations were confirmed biochemically by Western blot analysis of samples taken from the same cultures using specific antibodies against AO (Fig. 7, A and B). When WT cells in the early exponential growth phase were subjected to pexophagy conditions, AO protein levels only slightly decreased during the first hour after the shift. However, at later time points the AO levels remained constant, indicating that the peroxisomes in these cells were not degraded. The initial decrease most likely is because of the presence of a minor fraction of the cells that contains more than one peroxisome at the time of the shift. Mid-exponentially grown cells showed the continuous decrease in AO pr"

Although the expression of BDNF is known to be Ca2+-dependent, the regulation of trkB expression has not been extensively studied. Here we report that depolarization of cultured mouse cortical neurons increased the expression of the full-length, catalytically active isoform of trkB without affecting expression of the truncated isoform. This increase in protein expression was accompanied by increased levels of transcripts encoding full-length, but not truncated, trkB. Depolarization also regulated transcription of the gene, TRKB, via entry of Ca2+ through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and subsequent activation of Ca2+-responsive elements in the two TRKB promoters. Using transient transfection of neurons with TRKB promoter-luciferase constructs, we found that Ca2+ inhibited the upstream promoter P1 but activated the downstream promoter P2. Ca2+-dependent stimulation of TRKB expression requires two adjacent, non-identical CRE sites located within P2. The coordinated regulation of BDNF and trkB by Ca2+ may play a role in activity-dependent survival and synaptic plasticity by enhancing BDNF signaling in electrically active neurons.

Reichardt L.F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 677-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3258) Google Scholar). These effects of BDNF are mediated by the tyrosine receptor kinase, trkB. Binding of BDNF to trkB initiates dimerization and trans-autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the intracellular domain of trkB (2Patapoutian A. Reichardt L.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 3: 272-280Crossref Scopus (906) Google Scholar). These phospho-tyrosine residues act as docking sites for effector proteins that activate downstream signaling pathways, leading to the activation of protein kinase cascades, Ca2+ mobilization, and gene expression, which orchestrate the cellular responses to BDNF (3Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opinion Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1644) Google Scholar).

Neurol. 1996; 374: 21-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), very little is known about the mechanisms that regulate TRKB expression.At least four isoforms of trkB are produced by alternative splicing of the primary transcripts of the TRKB gene (14Middlemas D.S.

Of these, only the full-length isoform, which contains an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, is known to be capable of mediating BDNF signaling. Three truncated isoforms (T1, T2, and Tshc), which lack the intracellular kinase domain but possess the same extracellular BDNF binding domain as full-length receptors, can also be generated by alternative splicing. T1 is prominently expressed in the brain (14Middlemas D.S. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

These observations raise the possibility that the relative expression of full-length and truncated trkB isoforms in normal neurons can modulate cellular responsiveness to BDNF. Dysregulation of trkB isoform expression may also underlie some nervous system abnormalities. For example, overexpression of truncated trkB has been reported in cortical neurons in Alzheimer's disease brain (22Ferrer I. Marin C. Rey M.J. Ribalta T. Goutan E. Blanco R. Tolosa E. Marti E. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 58: 729-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), where it may contribute to neurodegeneration, and in the trisomy 16 mouse model of Down syndrome, where it results in failure of BDNF-mediated neuron survival (20Dorsey S.G. Bambrick L.L. Balice-Gordon R.J. Krueger B.K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2571-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The TRKB gene can be transcribed from two promoters, P1 and P2 (23Barettino D. Pombo P.M.G. Espliguero G. Rodriguez-Pena A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Within the TRKB upstream sequence are multiple potential regulatory elements, including several Ca2+/cAMP-response elements (CREs), suggesting that elevated Ca2+ and/or cAMP may regulate TRKB expression.In this report, we demonstrate that depolarization alters the relative expression of full-length and truncated trkB receptors in cultured cortical neurons and identify Ca2+-dependent regulatory elements in the TRKB promoters involved in this response.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Transfection—Cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic day-16 mouse embryos and plated at a density of 6 × 105/well in 24-well dishes for luciferase assays and 3 × 106/well in 35-mm dishes for RNA and protein analysis. Neuron cultures were maintained in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Neurons were transiently transfected 3–5 days after plating using a Ca2+-phosphate protocol (24Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRKB luciferase reporters were introduced at a concentration of 1 μg/well; cells were cotransfected with 0.5 μg/well TK Renilla plasmid (Promega). All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.Plasmids—Luciferase reporter genes were generated by inserting TRKB promoter fragments upstream of the luciferase gene in pGL3Basic (Promega) as BglII-BamHI fragments into the BglII site of the vector. Introduction of the BamHI site to clone the P2 promoters into pGL3 Basic regenerates the AT of the ATG translation start codon, therefore placing the 3′-end of the luciferase constructs at +2. Multiple independent PCR promoter products were sequenced and found to contain differences from the previously published sequence (23Barettino D. Pombo P.M.G. Espliguero G. Rodriguez-Pena A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), including a one-base deletion that shifts the transcription start site for P1 from -1800 to -1799. All but one base substitution could be independently verified from Trace sequences available at Ensembl. The sequence of the 2560 bp used in these studies is available at GenBank™, accession number AY307416.PCR primers used to generate promoter fragments were: upstream primers -2558, 5′-AAAGATCTCATCTATGTGAAAATCTTG-3′; -2258, 5′-AGATCTCGGTGGTAGCAATGGC-3′; -1429, 5′-AGATCTCCTATGAGCATGGTGAG-3′; -944, 5′-AAAGATCTGGAGTTTCTGCCCC-3′; and 899, 5′-AGATCTGCCAGCAGTAGCAGAG-3′.

Dominant negative CREB plasmid was provided by Dr. Yibin Wang, University of Maryland School of Medicine.Protein Analysis—Cells were harvested directly into boiling 2× sample buffer and fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gels run in MOPS buffer as previously described (20Dorsey S.G. Bambrick L.L. Balice-Gordon R.J. Krueger B.K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2571-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was conducted with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) using antibodies to the extracellular domain of trkB (BD Transduction Laboratories, Fig. 1A, or Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-181, Fig. 1B) at 1:500, anti-phospho-trkA (Tyr-490; Cell Signaling Technologies) 1:500, and anti-actin (Sigma) 1:5000.RNA Isolation and Analysis—Cells were stimulated for 5 h by addition of 50 mm KCl. Following stimulation, neurons were harvested and homogenized using Qiashredder (Qiagen), and RNA was isolated using RNeasy RNA extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm, and 0.5 μg was used for reverse transcription with Superscript II (Invitrogen) for 50 min at 42 °C. PCR was conducted in an Opticon real-time PCR cycler (MJ Designs) using Platinum Taq (Invitrogen), 0.2 mm dNTP, 30 μm/primer, and 3 mm MgCl2. Each PCR cycle consisted of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 62 °C, followed by 1 min at 72 °C. Amplification was monitored using the fluorescent dye, Sybergreen I (Roche Applied Science), diluted 1:100,000. For real-time PCR analysis, each cDNA sample (untreated versus KCl-treated) was diluted 1:100 and assayed in duplicate at 1, .5, .25, and .125× dilutions. RNA expression was computed from the slope of the C T versus ln [cDNA] relation and normalized to the concentration of β-actin as amplified using 5′-ATCGTGGGCCGCCCTAGGCA-3′ and 5′-TGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGAGGGG-3′ (25Pfaffl M.W.

Data are reported as the normalized RNA concentration from KCl-stimulated neurons relative to that of unstimulated neurons.Conventional RT-PCR to detect short 5′-UTRs of P1 and P2 was conducted using upstream primers in the unique 5′-UTR sequences (23Barettino D. Pombo P.M.G. Espliguero G. Rodriguez-Pena A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as follows: P1-1, 5′-AGGGTCGGTGCAAAGCATTT-3′; P1-2, 5′-TTAGGGACCAAGGAAGCATC-3′; P1-3, 5′-AGTTTCTGCCCCTGCTCTG-3′; or P2-4, 5′-AGCGCGGAGGGACTGTGT-3′ with the common downstream primer 5′-TCTTGCTGCTTGGTGCTGG-3′. The PCR amplification protocol consisted of 40 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, followed by 30 s at 72 °C.Luciferase Assays—Two days after transfection with TRKB luciferase reporter constructs, cells were stimulated for 6 h by the addition of 50 mm KCl in the absence or presence of 2 mm EGTA. EGTA was added 5 min prior to KCl stimulation. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 150 μlof Renilla luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). Twenty μl of extract were used to measure TRKB reporters (luciferase assay reagent; Promega) and Renilla luciferase activity (Renilla luciferase assay system; Promega). TRKB luciferase activity was then normalized by dividing by Renilla activity to allow comparison among wells and stimulation conditions. Cells transfected with luciferase vector lacking the TRKB promoter exhibited less than 3% of the activity of TRKB-luciferase-transfected neurons, and this activity was unaffected by depolarization.RESULTSDepolarization Increases the Level of Full-length trkB in Cortical Neurons—Because of the importance of BDNF/trkB signaling in activity-dependent changes in neurons, we investigated the ability of depolarization to regulate trkB expression. Embryonic mouse cortical neurons grown in culture for 5–7 days were depolarized with 50 mm added KCl to induce Ca2+ influx. Cells were then harvested for Western blot analysis. As previously reported for hippocampal neurons (20Dorsey S.G. Bambrick L.L. Balice-Gordon R.J. Krueger B.K. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2571-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cortical neurons expressed primarily full-length trkB (Fig. 1). In the presence of 50 mm added KCl, the level of full-length trkB protein was elevated by 5 h and continued to increase up to 16 h, the longest time studied (Fig. 1A). The low level of truncated trkB did not change following KCl treatment. Depolarization also increased the amount of phospho-trkB observed in response to BDNF stimulation (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the additional full-length trkB was functional.Depolarization Increases the Level of mRNA Encoding Full-length trkB in Cortical Neurons—In light of the effects of depolarization on full-length trkB expression, real-time PCR was conducted to determine the effect of depolarization on TRKB RNA expression. Following reverse transcription of total RNA, TRKB transcripts were analyzed using primer pairs specific for either full-length or truncated T1 trkB isoforms (Fig. 2A) (25Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. (2001). 2001; 29: 2002-2009Crossref Scopus (24916) Google Scholar). Five hours of stimulation with elevated KCl produced an ∼3-fold increase in full-length trkB transcripts, whereas there was no increase in T1 transcripts (Fig. 2B). The increase in full-length transcripts was sensitive to EGTA (data not shown).Fig. 2Depolarization induces full-length trkB mRNA expression. A, diagram illustrating the location of isoform-specific primers (arrows) for full-length and truncated (T1) trkB mRNAs. Both isoforms share a common extracellular BDNF binding domain and transmembrane domain (TM) but have different intracellular domains and their mRNAs have distinct 5′- and 3′-UTRs. B, cortical neurons were incubated for 5 h in the absence or presence of 50 mm added KCl. Levels of trkB RNA were quantified using real-time PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures” using primer pairs specific for RNA encoding either full-length (trkB.FL) or T1 truncated (trkB.TR) receptors (arrows in panel A). Data shown are mean ± S.E.

Pombo P.M.G. Espliguero G. Rodriguez-Pena A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggested that Ca2+ and/or cAMP can modulate TRKB. Ca2+-dependent TRKB transcription was investigated using a TRKB-luciferase reporter gene. Approximately 2.5 kb of the TRKB promoter region, including both P1 and P2, was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene and transiently transfected into cortical neurons using a Ca2+-phosphate method (24Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Depolarization of the neurons by the addition of 50 mm KCl resulted in a 2-fold increase in TRKB-dependent transcription as measured by luciferase activity (Fig. 3A). The presence of EGTA eliminated the response to KCl, indicating that Ca2+ influx was required to stimulate TRKB-luciferase expression.Fig. 3Ca2+ entry stimulates TRKB transcription. A, cortical neurons transiently transfected with -2558/+2 TRKB-luciferase plasmid were stimulated for 6 h with elevated KCl in the absence or presence of 2 mm extracellular EGTA. Luciferase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is reported relative to unstimulated activity. B, transfected neurons were stimulated as in panel A in the absence or presence of 100 μm nifedipine or 80 μm APV plus 20 μm DNQX. Data shown are means ± S.E. (n = 4). The same results were obtained in five (A) or two (B) experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine the pathway of Ca2+ entry in response to depolarization, neurons transfected with the -2558/+2 luciferase plasmid were stimulated with KCl in the absence and presence of Ca2+ channel or glutamate receptor (GluR) blockers (Fig. 3B). The l-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nifedipine (100 μm), completely blocked depolarization-induced activation of TRKB luciferase activity, whereas the combination of an NMDA GluR blocker (APV, 80 μm) and a kainate/AMPA GluR blocker (DNQX, 20 μm) had no effect. Control luciferase activity was not affected by EGTA, nifedipine, or APV/DNQX. Thus, activation of TRKB results from depolarization-induced entry of Ca2+ through l-type, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and does not require GluR activation.P1 and P2 TRKB Promoters Are Differentially Regulated by Ca2+—Because the upstream regulatory region of TRKB has been shown to contain two promoters, the ability of Ca2+ to separately activate P1 and P2 was tested using TRKB-luciferase reporter genes containing either P1 or P2 (Fig. 4A). Two constructs, -2558/-1710 and -2258/-1710 were generated to test the effects of Ca2+ on P1. The shorter construct lacked a potential Ca2+-dependent regulatory site (CRE) located at -2480 within the P1 domain of TRKB. In contrast to the -2558/+2 construct, which contains both P1 and P2 (Fig. 3), the luciferase activity of the P1 constructs was reduced by ∼50% following 6 h of depolarization (Fig. 4B). Inclusion of EGTA abolished the inhibition, consistent with a requirement for Ca2+ influx in the inhibition of P1-dependent transcription. The finding that Ca2+ inhibited the -2558/-1710 and -2258/-1710 constructs to the same extent indicates that the CRE in P1 is not required for inhibition.Fig. 4Ca2+ differentially regulates P1 and P2. A, schematic of TRKB promoters and corresponding TRKB reporter constructs. CRE sites are indicated by hatching. Transcription start sites for P1 (-1799) and P2 (-448) are indicated. B and C, cortical neurons transiently transfected with P1 (B) or P2 (C) TRKB-luciferase reporters were stimulated for 6 h with 50 mm added KCl in the absence or presence of EGTA. Luciferase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is reported relative to unstimulated activity. Data shown are mean luciferase ± S.E. (n = 4). Similar results were obtained in at least three experiments. D, RT-PCR analysis of cultured cortical neurons to detect P1- and P2-specific 5′-UTR sequences. Reactions 1–3 selectively amplify the three P1 5′-UTR splice variants. Reaction 4 detects the P2-specific 5′-UTR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The regulation of P2 was investigated using three constructs, -1429/+2, -944/+2, and -899/+2, which were transiently transfected into cortical neurons. In contrast to the P1 constructs, expression of P2 luciferase constructs was stimulated by KCl depolarization. Depolarization caused ∼3- and 2-fold increases in activity of the -1429/+2 and -944/+2 luciferase reporter constructs, respectively (Fig. 4C). Increased P2 activity was blocked by extracellular EGTA, demonstrating the requirement for Ca2+ influx to stimulate P2 TRKB expression. Expression of the -899/+2 TRKB P2-luciferase construct was not stimulated by depolarization, indicating that promoter elements between -944 and -899, possibly the tandem CRE sites, are required for the Ca2+ dependence of TRKB expression (see below). The larger degree of Ca2+-dependent stimulation observed with the -1429/+2 TRKB-luciferase construct as compared with the -944/+2 construct revealed the presence of an additional regulatory element(s) between -1429 and -944 capable of enhancing Ca2+-induced TRKB expression.Both P1- and P2-derived Transcripts Are Present in Cortical Neurons—The transcriptional activity of endogenous TRKB was investigated using RT-PCR analysis of P1- and P2-specific 5′-UTR sequences (23Barettino D. Pombo P.M.G. Espliguero G. Rodriguez-Pena A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the P1-derived transcript produces three potential 5′-UTRs (Fig. 4D, lanes 1–3), whereas P2 generates a single 5′-UTR (Fig. 4D, lane 4). PCR products corresponding to both P1- and P2-derived transcripts were readily detectable, indicating that TRKB is transcribed from both promoters in mouse embryonic cortical neurons.Both CRE Sites Are Required for Ca2+-stimulated Expression of TRKB P2—The sequence between -944 and -899 contains a pair of CRE sites separated by 4 bp (Fig. 5A). CRE sites are binding sites for members of the CREB family of transcription factors (26Sheng M. McFadden G. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1990; 4: 571-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), which mediate Ca2+-dependent expression of a wide variety of genes, including BDNF. The role of these tandem CRE sites in mediating P2-initiated TRKB expression following depolarization was examined by introducing substitution mutations (Fig. 5A). Mutation of either CRE site or both in the -1429/+2 TRKB-luciferase construct completely blocked stimulation of luciferase activity (Fig. 5B). Ca2+-stimulated expression of TRKB, therefore, requires both CRE sites. Mutation of either CRE site in the -944/+2 TRKB-luciferase construct similarly abolished depolarization-stimulated expression (data not shown).Fig. 5Tandem CRE sites are required for Ca2+-stimulated P2 expression. A, sequence of the tandem CRE elements in P2 with corresponding point mutations used to inactivate them. B, cortical neurons transiently transfected with the -1429/+2 TRKB-luciferase reporter containing either wild type or mutated CRE sites were stimulated for 6 h in 50 mm added KCl in the absence or presence of 2 mm EGTA. Luciferase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is plotted relative to unstimulated activity. C, cortical neurons cotransfected with either dominant negative (DN) CREB or control vector were stimulated and assayed as in panel B. Data shown are means ± S.E. (n = 4). Similar results were obtained in at least two additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mutation analysis of the CRE sites suggested that CREB, or a closely related family member, is responsible for mediating the Ca2+-dependent induction of TRKB expression. Cotransfection of a dominant negative CREB construct together with the -944/+2 TRKB-luciferase construct inhibited the Ca2+-stimulated expression of the TRKB reporter (Fig. 5C), consistent with a role for a CREB-related transcription factor in the induction of TRKB P2 by Ca2+.cAMP Stimulates TRKB Gene Expression—Because CREB is also activated in response to cAMP, we investigated the ability of cAMP to activate the TRKB P2 promoter. Cortical neurons transfected with either the -1429/+2 or -944/+2 TRKB-luciferase reporter gene were treated with 50 μm forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, for 6 h in either the absence or presence of 50 mm added KCl. Forskolin stimulated the luciferase activity of each TRKB reporter ∼2-fold, demonstrating that P2 can be stimulated by cAMP signaling (Fig. 6). The effects of depolarization-induced Ca2+ signaling and increased cAMP were additive for both -944/+2 and -1429/+2 P2-dependent reporter genes when the neurons were simultaneously treated with elevated KCl and forskolin.Fig. 6Cyclic AMP stimulation of TRKB expression. Cortical neurons transiently transfected with -1429/+2 TRKB-luciferase construct were stimulated with elevated KCl and/or 50 μm forskolin as indicated. Luciferase activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and is plotted relative to unstimulated activity. Data shown are mean luciferase ± S.E. (n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONDepolarization resulted in increased expression of full-length trkB protein and increased phosphorylation of trkB upon BDNF stimulation (Fig. 1). Depolarization also preferentially increased the level of endogenous full-length trkB mRNA without significantly affecting the level of truncated trkB message (Fig. 2B). These results led us to investigate the role of Ca2+ in the transcriptional regulation of TRKB. We show here that the two promoters of TRKB are differentially regulated by Ca2+. P1 reporter constructs were inhibited by Ca2+, whereas P2 reporters were stimulated by Ca2+ (Fig. 4, B and C). Although the quantitative contribution of P1- and P2-derived transcripts to specific trkB isoform expression has not yet been established, these observations suggest that Ca2+-regulated TRKB promoter selection can alter t"

Here we show that the growth and invasion of cervical cancer cells are strongly linked the expression and activity of the KCl cotransporter (KCC), an important regulator of the ionic and cellular osmotic homeostasis. Functional assays of KCl cotransport activation by osmotic swelling, staurosporine, and N-ethylmaleimide indicate that removal of the N-terminal 117 amino acids from KCC1 produces a dominant-negative loss-of-function phenotype for KCl cotransport in human cervical cancer cells. The capability for regulatory volume decrease is much attenuated in the loss-of-function KCC mutant cervical cancer cells. The loss-of-function KCC mutant cervical cancer cells exhibit inhibited cell growth accompanied by decreased activity of the cell cycle gene products retinoblastoma and cdc2 kinase. Reduced cellular invasiveness is in parallel by reduced expression of αvβ3 and α6β4 integrins, accompanied by decreased activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9. Inhibition of tumor growth in SCID mice confirms the crucial role of KCC in promoting cervical cancer growth and invasion.

Cervical cancer remains the second most common cancer among women worldwide, accounting for 15% of all female cancers (1Schoell W.M. Janicek M.F. Mirhashemi R. Semin. Surg. Oncol. 1999; 16: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The incidence of invasive cervical cancer varies considerably in different populations, reflecting the influence of variations in environmental factors, Pap smear surveillance, and the treatment of pre-invasive lesions.

The cellular pathophysiology of this disease remains largely unknown, and very little information is available on the roles of cellular ion transport systems in the neoplastic transformation and progression of cervical epithelial cells. The KCl cotransporter family (KCC) plays a significant role in the ionic and osmotic homeostasis of many cell types. The cDNA products of four KCC genes have been cloned (4Delpire E. Mount D.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 803-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The activities of KCC1 and KCC4 are osmotically sensitive and involved in volume regulation (5Gillen C.M. Brill S.

Ellory J.C. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that human cervical carcinogenesis is accompanied by increased expression of mRNA transcripts encoding KCC1, KCC3, and KCC4. However the lack of specific and potent pharmacological inhibitors of KCC (except [(dihydroindenyl)oxy] alkanoic acid (DIOA) at low concentrations) (11Garay R.P. Nazaret C. Hannaert P.A. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 696-701PubMed Google Scholar) has been a major obstacle to further studies on KCC function in human cervical carcinogenesis. More direct tests of the physiological functions of KCC and the consequences of loss of KCC activity require knock-out or knockdown experiments. Such experiments will involve either generation of homozygous knock-out animals or transgenic expression of dominant-negative or antisense constructs. Human cervical cancer cells express more than one KCC gene product. Thus, there is a serious possibility of functional compensation of the knock-out of one gene product by the unaltered or up-regulated expression of cognate genes. Structure-function studies with KCC1 show that the removal of 117 amino acids from the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain of mouse KCC1 (ΔN117) confers a dominant-negative phenotype when coexpressed with gene products of human KCC1, KCC3, or mouse KCC4 (12Casula S.

Proliferation Assay and Immunoblotting for Cell Cycle Analysis and Integrin Expression—To assess proliferation, cells were plated at the density of 105 per dish on 60-mm dishes, and the medium was changed every 2 days. Counts were performed with the aid of a hemocytometer using trypan blue exclusion (0.08%) to monitor viability. After 3 days in culture, wild-type or ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells were harvested on ice with protein sample buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by Lowry's protein assay. Immunoblots were first probed with phospho-specific antibodies against phospho-retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (Ser-795) and phospho-cdc2 (Tyr-15) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) and then stripped and reprobed with conventional antibodies to Rb and cdc2 kinase (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). Using the monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) against integrins α6, β4, or αvβ3, expression of integrin was determined by Western blot analysis as described in detail previously (18Yamani M.H. Tuzcu E.M. Starling R.C. Ratliff N.B. Yu Y. Vince D.G. Powell K. Cook D. McCarthy P. Young J.B. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1955-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Invasion Assay, Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMP) Zymography, and ELISA—Cell migration was assayed in the Boyden chamber as an index of invasive activity of the tumor cells. Matrigel was applied to the upper surface of the filter, and fibronectin was used as the chemoattractant in the lower compartment of the chamber (19Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were run for 6 h in serum-free culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and counted immediately after staining. Conditioned medium from the invasion assays was cleared of cells and debris by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min. MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were measured in the conditioned medium by gelatin zymography and by ELISA (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (18Yamani M.H. Tuzcu E.M. Starling R.C. Ratliff N.B. Yu Y. Vince D.G. Powell K. Cook D. McCarthy P. Young J.B. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1955-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Statistics—All values in the present study were reported as mean ± S.E. Student's paired or unpaired t test was used for statistical analyses. Differences between values were considered significantly when p < 0.05. Overexpression of KCC in Human Cervical Cancer—We first examined KCC polypeptide expression in surgical specimens of cervical cancer by immunofluorescent staining with antibody against the N-terminal of human KCC1 (capable of also detecting KCC4 (14Roussa E. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Casula S. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Thevenod F. Alper S.L. Cell Biol. 2001; 117: 335-344Google Scholar)). KCC polypeptide was nearly undetectable in the normal cervical epithelial tissues (Fig. 1A) of all surgical specimens examined (n = 30). In contrast, adjacent cervical cancer tissues abundantly expressed KCC polypeptide in cell membrane, as indicated by double staining with Na+/K+ ATPase (Fig. 1B). The KCC immunofluorescence staining in cancer tissue was absent in the absence of primary antibody and was competed with peptide antigen but not irrelevant peptide. One of the most significant functions of KCC is to facilitate cell volume regulation (20Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Ellory J.C. Gibson J.S. Stewart G.W. Contrib. Nephrol. 1998; 123: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As cell swelling is one of the major activating stimuli for KCl cotransport (5Gillen C.M. Brill S. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16237-16244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 6Mercado A. Song L. Vazquez N. Mount D.B. Gamba G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30326-30334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), we investigated hypotonicity-stimulated KCC activity in various cervical epithelial cell lines representing different stages of cervical carcinogenesis (Fig. 2). These included normal primary cervical epithelial cells, HPV-immortalized cells of low (Z172) and high tumor potential (Z183A), and cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa and HT-3). KCl cotransport in normal cervical epithelial cells and in Z172 cells was refractory to cell swelling but could be modestly activated by a hypotonic medium of 200 mosmol/liter. In contrast, KCl cotransport activity in cervical cancer cells (SiHa and HT-3) and in Z183A cells, though not different in isotonic medium, increased sharply as osmolarity was reduced. These results demonstrate a correlation between the osmotic sensitivity of KCl cotransport activity and different stages of cervical carcinogenesis. Generation of Human Cervical Cancer Cell Lines with Reduced KCl Cotransport Activity—We subsequently developed KCC mutant cervical cancer cell lines stably transfected with the dominant-negative ΔN117 mutant KCC1 cDNA. Further experiments were performed to assess KCC regulation and confirm that ΔN117 transfectants indeed exhibited reduced KCl cotransport. As shown in Fig. 3A, wild-type cervical cancer cells have KCC activity that is nearly quiescent in isotonic conditions. However high transport rates are observed in response to hypotonic challenge (230 mosmol/liter) and are inhibited by 20 μm DIOA. In contrast, hypotonicity-stimulated KCC activity is completely abolished in ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells. Treatment of wild-type cervical cancer cells with 1 μm staurosporine led to a 10-fold stimulation of KCC activity. However, the KCC activity in ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells is relatively insensitive to stimulation by staurosporine. Furthermore, whereas 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) led to a 25-fold stimulation of KCC activity in wild-type cervical cancer cells, KCl cotransport in ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells was only slightly increased (Fig. 3A). [Cl–]i estimated by 36Cl– equilibrium (Fig. 3B) was 30 ± 2 mm (n = 5) in wild-type cervical cancer cells and 46 ± 3 mm in ΔN117 mutant cells (n = 5, p < 0.01). Na+/K+ ATPase activity (Fig. 3C) did not differ in the two cell lines (13.4 ± 0.9 versus 14.8 ± 0.7 μmol phosphate/mg protein/h). Mock transfection did not change the regulation of KCC activity, [Cl–]i and Na+/K+ ATPase activity (Fig. 3). Taken together, these functional assays indicate that ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells exhibit dominant-negative suppression of KCl cotransport activity. Role of KCl Cotransport in Cell Volume Regulation— Prompted by the observation of substantially increased hypotonicity-stimulated KCl cotransport in cervical cancer cells, we tested the contribution of KCl cotransport activation to enhanced volume regulation of cervical cancer cells by comparison of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) in wild-type and ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the typical volume response of wild-type cervical cancer cells to hypotonic medium (230 mosmol/liter) can be divided into three phases: (1) an initial, rapid osmotic swelling to reach a peak cell volume; (2) a subsequent, rapid shrinkage in the following 2–3 min; and (3) a later, more gradual decrease of cell volume to reach a plateau value after 10–15 min. Addition of the KCC inhibitor DIOA (20 μm), which should abolish hypotonicity-stimulated KCl cotransport (Fig. 3A), increased the initial, osmotic swelling, attenuated the shrinkage phase, and inhibited the gradual, slower decrease in cell volume (final volume 122 ± 2% for wild-type cervical cancer cells treated with 20 μm DIOA versus 104 ± 3% without DIOA, p < 0.01). Moreover, the ΔN117 mutant cells showed yet further attenuation of RVD (final volume, 132 ± 1%, p < 0.005). Remarkably, cervical cancer cells expressing the KCC1 ΔN117 mutant exhibit a lower capacity for volume regulation than do wild-type cervical cancer cells treated with the KCC inhibitor, DIOA. The predominant pathway for RVD of human cervical cancer cells is the opening of the volume-sensitive organic osmolyte/anion channel (VSOAC), which leads to Cl– and taurine efflux (15Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Browning J.A. Wilkins R.J. Ellory J.C. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 347-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, to further dissect the mechanisms of retarded RVD, the whole-cell mode of the patch clamp technique was used to measure membrane currents. As shown in Fig. 4, B-E, the amplitude and activation rate of VSOAC were significantly decreased in ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells. Consistently, in complementary taurine transport experiments, the swelling-activated taurine efflux rate constant decreased significantly from 0.06 ± 0.002 min–1 (n = 6) in wild-type cervical cancer cells to 0.032 ± 0.001 min–1 (n = 6) in ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 4, F and G). These results indicate that reduced RVD in ΔN117 mutant cells results from both the near abolition of hypotonicity-activated KCl cotransport and the down-regulation of VSOAC activity. Suppression of Tumor Growth and Invasion by Δ N117 Mutant—We have reported previously (9Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Hsu K.F. Liu H.S. Dunham P.B. Holtzman E.J. Ellory J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14714-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) that alteration of [Cl–] i can affect activities of Rb protein and cdc2 kinase, two key cell cycle regulators controlling progression through the restriction point from G1 into S phase and from G2 into M phase, respectively. Overexpression of the KCC1 mutant ΔN117 elevates [Cl–] i by decreasing the KCC activity (Fig. 3B). We therefore hypothesized that the ΔN117 KCC1 overexpression might alter cell proliferation. As shown in Fig. 5A, ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells indeed proliferate more slowly than do wild-type cervical cancer cells. This decrease in cell proliferation is accompanied by a decrease in the phosphorylated active form of Rb protein and an increase in the phosphorylated inactive form of cdc2 kinase (Fig. 5B), suggesting that KCC activity is important for the progression of the cell cycle clock. The alteration of [Cl–] i has been suggested as an important signal to regulate the activation of integrin in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (22Menegazzi R. Busetto S. Decleva E. Cramer R. Dri P. Patriarca P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 423-434PubMed Google Scholar, 23Menegazzi R. Busetto S. Cramer R. Dri P. Patriarca P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Although epithelial cells express a variety of cell adhesion molecules, integrins are the most important extracellular matrix receptors known to play a major role in the invasion and progression of most types of cancers (24Juliano R.L. Varner J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Abnormal expression of integrins such as αvβ3, α6β4, α2β1, and α3β1 has been reported in human cervical cancer cells (25Aplin J.D. Dawson S. Seif M.W. Br. J. Cancer. 1996; 74: 240-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 26Jeffers M.D. Paxton J. Bolger B. Richmond J.A. Kennedy J.H. McNicol A.M. Gynecol. Oncol. 1997; 64: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Chattopadhyay N. Ray S. Biswas N. Chatterjee A. Gynecol. Oncol. 1999; 75: 215-221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To study the role of integrins in tumor cell invasion, we assayed cell invasion in a Boyden chamber, as an in vitro model for cancer invasion in matrigel (19Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Function-blocking monoclonal antibodies against integrins αvβ3, α6, or β4, but not α2, α3, or β1, potently inhibited the invasion of wild-type cervical cancer SiHa cells, whereas IgG or boiled inactive monoclonal antibodies were without effect (Fig. 6A). This indicates that αvβ3 and α6β4 integrins might play an important role in the invasion of cervical cancer cells. Interestingly, the invasion of wild-type human cervical cancer cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by KCC inhibitor, DIOA. Moreover, invasion is much attenuated in the ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells (Fig. 6A). Conditioned medium collected from invasion assays was assessed for MMP activity. MMPs comprise a group of enzymes critically involved in the integrin-mediated dissolution of extracellular matrix (24Juliano R.L. Varner J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). MMP-2 and MMP-9, highly expressed in wild-type cervical cancer cells, are released as a proenzyme (inactive form) that is proteolytically activated to the active form (Fig. 6B). Compared with wild-type cells, ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells showed decreased zymographic activity of MMP-2 (4-fold, p < 0.001) and MMP-9 (2-fold, p < 0.01). ELISA determinations confirmed the decreased activities of MMP-2 (4.5-fold, p < 0.001) and MMP-9 (2.6-fold, p < 0.01) in the ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells (Fig. 6C). Because αvβ3 and α6β4 integrins can play a critical role in cervical cancer invasion and cancer invasion is much attenuated in the ΔN117 mutation (Fig. 6A), the effect of altered KCC activity on the integrin expression of αvβ3 and α6β4 was examined. Compared with wild-type cells, the ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells demonstrated a significant decrease in expression of α6β4 and αvβ3 integrins in Western blots (Fig. 7A) and in immunofluorescence analyses (Fig. 7B). Taken together, the dominant-negative KCC phenotype is associated with inhibition of cell invasion accompanied by decreased the expression of α6β4 and αvβ3 integrins and reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities. To avoid clonal variation and selection, we did the same series of functional assays in another four clones of cervical cancer SiHa and HT-3 cells stably transfected with the dominant-negative ΔN117 mutant KCC1 cDNA. Similar results were obtained in the measurement of KCC activity, volume response, electrophysiology, proliferation, invasion ability, and integrin expressions (data not shown). Tumor Growth and Invasion in SCID Mice—Down-regulation of cell proliferation and invasion suggests but does not prove an important role for KCl cotransport in the pathophysiology of human cervical cancer. To test whether manipulation of KCl cotransport alters tumor growth and invasion in vivo, we inoculated SCID mice subcutaneously with the wild-type or ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cell lines. Rapid tumor growth was obvious in the groups inoculated with wild-type cervical cancer cells (Fig. 8A). The ΔN117 mutation significantly reduced the rate of tumor growth and decreased the tumor size 50 days after grafting (Fig. 8, A and B). The histology of SCID mice xenografts shows the malignant characteristics of wild-type cervical cancer cells, direct invasion into adjacent muscular tissues and blood vessels and formation of infiltrating nests of cells that vary greatly in size and contour (Fig. 8C). The xenograft specimens resulting from inoculation of ΔN117 mutant cells formed small tumors with intact capsules and without local invasion (Fig. 8D). In addition, all xenografts resulting from inoculation of ΔN117 mutant cells exhibit an area of central necrosis of varying size (Fig. 8D). Moreover, the mitotic figures of wild-type cervical cancer cells are far more numerous than ΔN117 mutant (80 ± 3 versus 14 ± 2 per high powered field (n = 20), p < 0.001). Consistent with in vitro assay (Fig. 7, A and B), anti-integrin β4 and αvβ3 immunofluorescence analysis in xenograftic tumors resulting from the transplantation of ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells showed reduced expression of integrins β4 and αvβ3 (Fig. 9A, green). Immunoblots confirmed the presence of ΔN117 KCC1 polypeptide in the small tumors (Fig. 9B).Fig. 9A, anti-integrin β4 and αvβ3 immunofluorescence analysis (green) shows decreased expression of β4 and αvβ3 in tumor xenografts resulting from the transplantation of ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells.

Adragna N.C. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Ellory J.C. Gibson J.S. Stewart G.W. Contrib. Nephrol. 1998; 123: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In surgical specimens from cervical cancer patients, tumor cells express abundant KCC polypeptide, whereas KCC polypeptide expression is low in adjacent normal cervical tissues. This finding is consistent with our previous study (10Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Ellory J.C. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) showing human cervical carcinogenesis is accompanied by the up-regulation of KCC mRNA. The main physiological function of KCC is to regulate cell volume, where KCC is activated by cell swelling (20Lauf P.K. Adragna N.C. Cell. Physiol. Biochem. 2000; 10: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 21Ellory J.C. Gibson J.S. Stewart G.W. Contrib. Nephrol. 1998; 123: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). KCl cotransport in normal human cervical epithelial cells is quiescent in normal physiological conditions and of modest magnitude during hypotonic shock. KCl cotransport in cervical cancer cells is also nearly quiescent in the isotonic condition. However, hypotonicity activates in these cancer cells a high rate of KCl cotransport, which is critically involved in the RVD, a cellular defensive mechanism against osmotic shock. Cancer cells usually have higher rates of metabolism, mitosis, and migration than those of normal cells. Growth, mitosis, and migration can perturb cell volume homeostasis significantly. The maintenance of cell volume homeostasis is a fundamental property of mammalian cells, and most cells possess mechanisms to regulate their volume during osmotic challenge. The close linkage of cell volume regulation and cell proliferation implies that the overexpression of KCl cotransport activity may be a selective advantage for cervical cancer cells. Here we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that KCC activity is critical for proliferation and invasion of cervical cancer cells and possibly also for tumorigenesis. The functional assays of KCl cotransport activation by osmotic swelling, staurosporine, and NEM indicate that, as in Xenopus oocytes (12Casula S. Shmukler B.E. Wilhelm S. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Su W. Chernova M.N. Brugnara C. Alper S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41870-41878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), removal of the N-terminal 117 amino acids from KCC1 produces a dominant-negative loss-of-function phenotype for KCl cotransport in human cervical cancer cells. Overexpression of the N-terminal truncation mutant offers a unique genetic tool for functional inhibition of all KCC gene products in cervical cancer cells. Inactivation of KCl cotransport by either inhibitor (DIOA) or by the dominant-negative ΔN117 mutant profoundly suppressed the invasive ability of cervical cancer cells. We considered two possible explanations for the potent antitumor effect of overexpression of KCC1 ΔN117. First, and most simply, the ΔN117 mutant changes the regulatory mechanisms of cell volume control. Cancer invasion is a complex process of cell adhesion, migration, and secretion of different classes of enzymes (24Juliano R.L. Varner J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Cell migration involves substantial alterations of cell volume, and thus volume regulatory mechanisms are certainly activated (29Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1556) Google Scholar). The present and previous studies (10Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Ellory J.C. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Shen M.R. Chou C.Y. Browning J.A. Wilkins R.J. Ellory J.C. J. Physiol. 2001; 537: 347-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggest that swelling-activated KCC and ion channels work synergistically for the volume regulation of cervical cancer cells. The ΔN117 mutation abolishes hypotonicity-induced KCl cotransport and down-regulates VSOAC, thereby retarding RVD. Cellular invasiveness is therefore affected by overexpression of ΔN117 mutant. Second, and perhaps more importantly, KCC activity appears to be associated with MMP activation and integrin expression. In carcinogenesis, cervical epithelial cells breach the basement membrane to proliferate and migrate within the adjacent connective tissue. An important event in the dissolution of the matrix of the basement membrane involves the activation of MMP cascade, which is accompanied by altered expression of several cell adhesion molecules by the transformed cells (24Juliano R.L. Varner J.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 812-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 28Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3756) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the function of αvβ3 and α6β4 integrins in the invasion of cervical cancer cells. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic modification studies both indicate that KCC activity parallels the invasive ability of cervical cancer cells. Gel activity assays, immunoblots, and immunofluorescent staining further suggest that the dominant-negative KCC phenotype is associated with the decreased expression of αvβ3 and α6β4 integrins, which is accompanied, in turn, by inactivation of MMP-2 and MMP-9. These findings suggest a novel function of KCl cotransport in cancer invasion, the regulation of integrin expression and of MMP activity. The role of [Cl–] i has been suggested as an important second messenger to regulate β2 integrin activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to tumor necrotic factor stimulation (22Menegazzi R. Busetto S. Decleva E. Cramer R. Dri P. Patriarca P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 423-434PubMed Google Scholar, 23Menegazzi R. Busetto S. Cramer R. Dri P. Patriarca P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4606-4614Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Further work will be required to determine whether these changes in integrin and MMP expression reflect KCC-associated changes in [Cl–] i or [K+] i or other functions of KCC possibly unrelated to ion transport. Such transport-independent cytoskeletal and signaling functions have been described for the Na+/H+ exchanger NHE1 in cultured fibroblasts (30Denker S.P. Barber D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is interesting to find that ΔN117 mutant cervical cancer cells exhibit little capacity for RVD, secondary to inhibition of KCl cotransport and down-regulation of VSOAC activity. This suggests an interaction at either the signaling or membrane activity levels of the RVD process. We have demonstrated previously (31Shen M.R. Droogmans G. Eggermont J. Voets T. Ellory J.C. Nilius B. J. Physiol. 2000; 529: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) that the activity of VSOAC is differentially expressed during the cell cycle progression of human cervical cancer cells. To block this channel activity could inhibit cell proliferation by arresting the cell cycle progression. Thus, the down-regulation of the VSOAC activity by KCC mutation would have a profound impact on cell proliferation. However, until the molecular identities of VSOAC are established, we are limited to indirect methods to show this unusual function of KCC mutation on the ion channel activity. Nevertheless, the use of dominant-negative mutants allows us to make some significant progress in demonstrating the novel role of KCl cotransport in cell volume regulation. In conclusion, the above results indicate that KCl cotransport plays a crucial role in the growth and invasion of human cervical cancer. Blockade of KCl cotransport may be a useful therapeutic adjunctive strategy to retard or prevent cervical cancer invasion. We thank Boris Shmukler and Sabine Wilhelm for assistance."

A proximal electron donor, rubredoxin, was used to supply reducing equivalents from NADPH via ferredoxin: NADP+ oxidoreductase, and xanthine/xanthine oxidase was used to provide a calibrated flux of superoxide. SOR turnover in this system was well coupled, i.e. ∼202·¯ reduced:NADPH oxidized over a 10-fold range of superoxide flux. The reduction of the ferric SOR active site by reduced rubredoxin was independently measured to have a second-order rate constant of ∼1 × 106m–1 s–1. Analysis of the kinetics showed that: (i) 1 μm SOR can convert a 10 μm/min superoxide flux to a steady state superoxide concentration of 10–10m, during which SOR turns over about once every 6 s, (ii) the diffusion-controlled reaction of reduced SOR with superoxide is the slowest process during turnover, and (iii) neither ligation nor deligation of the active site carboxylate of SOR limits the turnover rate. An intracellular SOR concentration on the order of 10 μm is estimated to be the minimum required for lowering superoxide to sublethal levels in aerobically growing SOD knockout mutants of Escherichia coli. SORs from Desulfovibrio gigas and Treponema pallidum showed similar turnover rates when substituted for the D. vulgaris SOR, whereas superoxide dismutases showed no SOR activity in our assay.

The reduction of superoxide via Reaction 1 is catalyzed by a novel class of non-heme iron enzymes called superoxide reductases (SORs). 1The abbreviations used are: SOR, superoxide reductase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; 1Fe-SOR, SOR containing an [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site as the only prosthetic group; 2Fe-SOR, superoxide reductase containing an accessory [Fe(Cys)4] site; 2Fe-SORpink, 2Fe-SOR containing a ferrous [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site and a ferric [Fe(Cys)4] site; E47A 2Fe-SOR, recombinant engineered variant of D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR in which the glutamate residue providing the ligand to the ferric [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site is substituted by an alanine residue; C13S 2Fe-SOR, recombinant D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR engineered variant in which the accessory [Fe(Cys)4] site is absent; C13S 2Fe-SORblue, C13S 2Fe-SOR containing a ferric [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site; FNR, spinach ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase; Rub, rubredoxin; D. vulgaris H, Desulfovibrio vulgaris strain Hildenborough.1The abbreviations used are: SOR, superoxide reductase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; 1Fe-SOR, SOR containing an [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site as the only prosthetic group; 2Fe-SOR, superoxide reductase containing an accessory [Fe(Cys)4] site; 2Fe-SORpink, 2Fe-SOR containing a ferrous [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site and a ferric [Fe(Cys)4] site; E47A 2Fe-SOR, recombinant engineered variant of D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR in which the glutamate residue providing the ligand to the ferric [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site is substituted by an alanine residue; C13S 2Fe-SOR, recombinant D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR engineered variant in which the accessory [Fe(Cys)4] site is absent; C13S 2Fe-SORblue, C13S 2Fe-SOR containing a ferric [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site; FNR, spinach ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase; Rub, rubredoxin; D. vulgaris H, Desulfovibrio vulgaris strain Hildenborough. e-+O2·¯+2H+→SORH2O2Reaction1(Eq. 1) The SORs are characterized by a mononuclear iron active site shown in Scheme 1 with a ligand set consisting of a square plane of histidine nitrogens, an axial cysteine sulfur and, in the ferric form, a glutamate carboxylate (10Coehlo A.V.

Although superoxide is thermodynamically capable of reducing the ferric SOR site, no such reactivity is apparent, and, as a consequence, SORs show little or no superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, even when the ligating glutamate carboxylate is replaced by non-coordinating side chains, such as alanine (5Jenney Jr., F.E.

Neither the kinetics of reduction of the ferric SOR site by other exogenous reducing agents, nor the SOR catalytic turnover cycle have been systematically studied, perhaps because the in vivo electron donor(s) to SORs have generally not been established. Thus, no value for the rate constant, k 3, in Scheme 1 has been reported for any SOR. The small electron transfer protein, rubredoxin, has been proposed to be a proximal electron donor to both 1Fe- and 2Fe-SORs (5Jenney Jr., F.E. Verhagen M.F.J.M. Cui X. Adams M.W.W. Science. 1999; 286: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 18Brumlik M.J. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4996-5004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and, consistent with this suggestion, addition of Pyrococcus furiosus 1Fe-SOR resulted in a slight acceleration of rubredoxin oxidation by superoxide (5Jenney Jr., F.E. Verhagen M.F.J.M. Cui X. Adams M.W.W. Science. 1999; 286: 306-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In at least two bacteria, the genes for 2Fe-SOR and rubredoxin are co-transcribed (18Brumlik M.J. Voordouw G. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4996-5004Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Das A. Coulter E.D.

For one of these bacteria, the sulfate-reducer, Desulfovibrio vulgaris, rubredoxin has been shown to preferentially reduce the [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site of 2Fe-SOR and to function as the proximal electron donor to 2Fe-SOR in an artificial NADPH:superoxide oxidoreductase reaction cycle shown in Scheme 2 and Equation 2, where FNR is the flavoprotein, spinach ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase (20Coulter E.D. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In this system a calibrated flux of superoxide was generated from reduction of dissolved dioxygen using xanthine and xanthine oxidase, the well established method used to generate superoxide in SOD activity assays (21McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“39662react2”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 2) This report describes the kinetics of Reaction 2 using the catalytic system shown in Scheme 2, and analyzes the kinetics according to Scheme 1. The results demonstrate the kinetic competence of both 1Fe- and 2Fe-SORs to lower the steady state superoxide concentration to sublethal levels. The results also quantitate and clarify several qualitative mechanistic observations, presumptions, and speculations in the SOR literature.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3802-3807Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (with all 2Fe-SOR extinction coefficients per monomer of the homodimer). FNR concentration, catalase, and SOD activities were assumed to be those provided by Sigma. SOR Activity Assay—The NADPH:superoxide oxidoreductase assay described by Coulter and Kurtz (20Coulter E.D. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was modified and used as described below. The buffer for all activity measurements and stock solutions was 50 mm phosphate containing 100 μm EDTA, pH 7.5. All reactions were conducted aerobically at room temperature. In 1 ml of buffer, aliquots of concentrated stock solutions were added to achieve concentrations of 500 μm xanthine, 1 μm FNR, ∼200 units/ml catalase, and 100 μm NADPH, respectively. The high catalase activity was added to remove hydrogen peroxide, which is not only a product of the SOR reaction but also a by-product of the xanthine/xanthine oxidase superoxide generating system (26Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After ∼30 s rubredoxin was added to a concentration of 1 μm. Approximately 30 s later either SOR (1 μm in [Fe(His)4(Cys)] sites) or SOD (10, 50, 100 or 250 units/ml) were added. After another ∼30 s, a pre-calibrated amount of xanthine oxidase (typically 5–15 μl of a stock xanthine oxidase solution prepared by diluting the ammonium sulfate suspension 5-fold with buffer) was added to initiate a flux of superoxide. The superoxide flux generated by the added xanthine oxidase was measured separately both before and after the assay using the same concentrations of xanthine and xanthine oxidase and the same buffer as in the assay mixture and measuring the rate of reduction of horse heart cytochrome c (ϵ550 = 21,500 m–1 cm–1), as described previously (20Coulter E.D. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The rate of NADPH consumption in the SOR assay was measured as the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (ϵ340 = 6,220 m–1 cm–1). For correlations with superoxide flux, the small background NADPH consumption rate measured prior to addition of xanthine oxidase was subtracted from that measured after the addition of xanthine oxidase. Variations on this protocol are described under “Results.” Effects of Cyanide and Azide on SOR Activity—The SOR activity assay was conducted as described above, but including small additions of ∼1 m sodium azide or sodium cyanide stock solutions, to achieve concentrations of either 1 or 20 mm azide or cyanide in the assay mixture. The superoxide flux was pre- and post-calibrated as described above but in the presence of the indicated concentrations of azide or cyanide. For some experiments, D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR or E47A 2Fe-SOR, having concentrations of ∼860 or ∼700 μm in ferrous [Fe(His)4(Cys)] sites, respectively, were pre-incubated with ∼20 mm sodium cyanide for ∼20 h at 4 °C. Aliquots of these cyanide-incubated 2Fe-SOR solutions were added to the assay mixture as candidate SORs in the presence of either 1 or 20 mm cyanide in the assay mixture.

Open table in a new tab Stopped-flow Monitoring of Reactions of C13S 2Fe-SORblue with Reduced Rubredoxin—All reactions, column chromatographies, and other manipulations of proteins were conducted in solutions buffered with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at room temperature, unless otherwise indicated. D. vulgaris C13S 2Fe-SORblue was prepared by aerobically oxidizing ∼1 ml of as-isolated C13S 2Fe-SOR (∼500 μm in [Fe(His)4(Cys)] sites) by the addition of 2 eq of sodium hexachloroiridate (Aldrich). The oxidized C13S 2Fe-SOR was then passed over a 5-ml Hi-Trap desalting column (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting C13S 2Fe-SORblue solution was then diluted anaerobically to ∼400 μm in [Fe(His)4(Cys)] sites. Reduced D. vulgaris rubredoxin solutions were prepared by purging solutions of ∼500 μm oxidized (as-isolated) rubredoxin with argon for 20 min, in a 1-ml quartz cuvette. This sample was then divided into three sealed plastic tubes, and further diluted (∼5 ml total volume) anaerobically to final concentrations of 80, 40, and 20 μm rubredoxin. These solutions were again purged with argon for ∼20 min. These rubredoxin solutions were then reduced by titration with an anaerobic ∼20 mm sodium dithionite stock solution. The titrations were monitored until addition of a drop (∼1 μl) of the sodium dithionite stock solution gave no further decrease in absorbance at 490 nm. The reduced rubredoxin and C13S 2Fe-SORblue solutions were loaded under an argon purge separately into the two 2.5-ml drive syringes of a RSM-1000 stopped-flow spectrophotometer fitted with a rapid scanning monochromator (OLIS, Inc.). Following stopped-flow mixing, absorbance changes between 350 and 770 nm were monitored by rapid scanning at 25 °C. Specificity of the SOR Activity Assay—Previous work from our laboratory (20Coulter E.D. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR can serve as the terminal component of the NADPH:superoxide oxidoreductase described by Reaction 2 and Scheme 2. Fig. 1 contains plots of NADPH consumption rates for this SOR assay using various candidate SORs. As shown in Fig. 1, the dimeric D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR, the tetrameric D. gigas 1Fe-SOR (a.k.a. neelaredoxin) (27Chen L. Sharma P. Le Gall J. Mariano A.M. Teixeira M. Xavier A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the dimeric T. pallidum 1Fe-SOR (7Lombard M. Touati D. Fontecave M. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27021-27026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 23Jovanovic T. Ascenso C. Hazlett K.R. Sikkink R. Krebs C. Litwiller R. Benson L.M. Moura I.

Chem. 2000; 275: 28439-28448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), all show very similar activities (listed under Supplemental Materials Table IS). The E47A variant of D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR, in which the ligating glutamate shown in Scheme 1 has been changed to alanine, also shows activity indistinguishable from the wild type protein. Confirming the previous results (20Coulter E.D. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), no NADPH consumption above background occurred upon addition of xanthine oxidase if any of the other protein components were omitted from the assay mixture. Under the standard SOR assay conditions, but substituting either Cu/Zn- or Fe-SOD at 10, 50, 100, or 250 units/ml (corresponding to low micromolar levels of SOD) in place of SOR, NADPH was not consumed above background levels. Classical SODs are, thus, not active in this assay at concentrations comparable with SOR, presumably because the SODs cannot accept electrons from any of the donors present in the assay mixture (i.e. NADPH, FNR, or rubredoxin) at rates sufficient to outcompete the catalytic disproportionation of superoxide by the SOD. Consistent with this interpretation, the NADPH consumption associated with 2Fe-SOR in the assay was found to be inhibited by Cu/Zn- or Fe-SOD (cf. Supplemental Materials Fig. S1). In the case of Cu/Zn-SOD inhibition to background levels could be achieved by ∼1,000 units/ml. Thus, while classical SODs are not detectably active in the SOR assay, they do compete with SOR for superoxide, as expected (6Lombard M. Fontecave M. Touati D. Niviere V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 115-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Effects of Cyanide and Azide on SOR Activity—Cyanide and azide are known to bind weakly to both the ferric and ferrous [Fe(His)4(Cys)] sites of SORs (28Romao C.V. Liu M.Y. Le Gall J. Gomes C.M. Braga V. Pacheco I. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Silva G. Oliveira S. Gomes C.M. Pacheco I. Liu M.Y. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. Legall J. Rodrigues-Pousada C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 30Clay M.D. Jenney Jr., F.E. Hagedoorn P.L. George G.N. Adams M.W.W. Johnson M.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 788-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and spectroscopic evidence indicates that these anions occupy the coordination site trans to the axial cysteine ligand. For this reason, cyanide has been presumed to be an inhibitor of SOR (31Shearer J. Fitch S.B. Kaminsky W. Benedict J. Scarrow R.C. Kovacs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3671-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), even though no such inhibition data have been published. The data in Table I show that in fact, azide or cyanide at 1 mm caused no substantial inhibition (or activation) of SOR activity using the assay described here. The E47A variant of D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR also was not inhibited by 1 mm cyanide or azide in the assay mixture. In fact, azide or cyanide added to the assay mixture at up to 20 mm showed neither substantial inhibition nor any significant change in the ratio of NADPH consumption rate to SOR flux (cf. Table I). However, when D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR (or the E47A variant) was incubated for ∼20 h with 20 mm cyanide, and this cyanide-preincubated SOR was added to the assay mixture, inhibition was observed, but only if 20 mm cyanide was also present in the assay mixture. The preincubation with a large excess of cyanide results in slow air oxidation of the ferrous [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site (which is otherwise air-stable) and formation of the ferric [Fe(His)4(Cys)(CN–)] complex (28Romao C.V. Liu M.Y. Le Gall J. Gomes C.M. Braga V. Pacheco I. Xavier A.V. Teixeira M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Consistent with electrochemical data on synthetic model complexes (31Shearer J. Fitch S.B. Kaminsky W. Benedict J. Scarrow R.C. Kovacs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3671-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the binding of cyanide presumably shifts the reduction potential of the ferric [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site sufficiently negative so that the NADPH/FNR/rubredoxin system is unable to reduce it, thereby blocking electron flow at the SORox point of Scheme 2. This pattern of cyanide inhibition provides further confirmation that 2Fe-SOR, and, more specifically, its [Fe(His)4(Cys)] site, is the terminal catalytic component of the NADPH:superoxide oxidoreductase in this assay. Stoichiometry and Component Saturation in the SOR Activity Assay— Fig. 2 shows that, when the superoxide flux in the SOR activity assay of D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR was varied over a range of 2.5(± 0.4) to 37(± 1.4) μm superoxide/min, a proportional increase occurred in the NADPH consumption rate. According to Reaction 2, the molar stoichiometry of the NADPH consumption rate to superoxide flux in the steady state should be 1:2. The slope of the fitted line in Fig. 2, ∼0.56, is consistent with the expected ratio, and shows that under these SOR turnover conditions, essentially all of the superoxide generated by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system is consumed via the pathway diagrammed in Scheme 2. These results are consistent with those previously reported over a much smaller superoxide flux range (20Coulter E.D. Kurtz Jr., D.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 394: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 also shows that, under these conditions, the superoxide flux is the rate-limiting process for NADPH consumption. The concentration of D. vulgaris 2Fe-SOR in the activity assay was varied from 50 nm to 10 μm in [Fe(His)4(Cys)] sites, while maintaining all other component concentrations and superoxide flux constant at the standard assay levels. A plot of NADPH consumption rate versus 2Fe-SOR concentration under these conditions is shown in Fig. 3. Approximately 0.5 μm 2Fe-SOR is needed to reach maximum consumption of NADPH under the standard conditions. A least-squares fit of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data gave the solid curve shown in Fig. 3 with V max of 11.6 ± 0.3 μm NADPH consumed per min and apparent Km (app) of ∼100 nm 2Fe-SOR (at a superoxide flux of 21.3 ± 0.7 μm/min). The physical meaning of this Km (app) is ambiguous. However, because from Fig. 2, the rate-limiting step at saturating 2Fe-SOR is production of superoxide, then, at less-than-saturating 2Fe-SOR concentrations (<0.5 μm from Fig. 2), the rate-limiting step must become the reaction of 2Fe-SOR with either superoxide or reduced rubredoxin. An analogous set of experiments was conducted in which the concentration of D. vulgaris rubredoxin was varied between 50 nm and 10 μm while maintaining all other concentrations and superoxide flux constant at the standard levels. A plot of the NADPH consumption rates versus concentration of rubredoxin is shown in Fig. 4. Approximately 0.45 μm rubredoxin was needed for the maximum NADPH consumption rate under these conditions. A fit of the Michaelis-Menten equation to the data gave V max of 11.8 ± 0.2 μm NADPH/min, and Km (app) of ∼100 nm rubredoxin (at a superoxide flux of 19.9 ± 0.8 μm/min). Thus, at <0.45 μm rubredoxin, the rate-limiting step must become either the reduction of rubredoxin by FNR or reduction of 2Fe-SOR by rubredoxin. Varying the concentrations of FNR (0.25–2 μm) or NADPH (50–300 μm) had very little effect on the superoxide-dependent NADPH consumption rates measured in this assay (cf. Supplemental Materials Figs. S2 and S3). The 2Fe-SOR/rubredoxin reaction (corresponding to the"
https://openalex.org/W2172151424,"We describe herein the cDNA cloning, expression, and characterization of a hemolytic lectin and its related species from the parasitic mushroom Laetiporus sulphureus. The lectin designated LSL (L. sulphureus lectin), is a tetramer composed of subunits of ∼35 kDa associated by non-covalent bonds. From a cDNA library, three similar full-length cDNAs, termed LSLa, LSLb, and LSLc, were generated, each of which had an open reading frame of 945 bp encoding 315 amino acid residues. These proteins share 80–90% sequence identity and showed structural similarity to bacterial toxins: mosquitocidal toxin (MTX2) from Bacillus sphaericus and α toxin from Clostridium septicum. Native and recombinant forms of LSL showed hemagglutination and hemolytic activity and both activities were inhibited by N-acetyllactosamine, whereas a C-terminal deletion mutant of LSLa (LSLa-D1) retained hemagglutination, but not hemolytic activity, indicating the N-terminal domain is a carbohydrate recognition domain and the C-terminal domain functions as an oligomerization domain. The LSL-mediated hemolysis was protected osmotically by polyethylene glycol 4000 and maltohexaose. Inhibition studies showed that lacto-N-neotetraose (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc) was the best inhibitor for LSL. These results indicate that LSL is a novel pore-forming lectin homologous to bacterial toxins.

These results indicate that LSL is a novel pore-forming lectin homologous to bacterial toxins. By definition, a lectin is a sugar-binding protein or glycoprotein of non-immune origin, which agglutinates cells and/or precipitates glycoconjugates (1Goldstein I.J. Hughes R.C. Monsigny M. Osawa T. Sharon N. Nature. 1980; 285: 66Crossref Scopus (650) Google Scholar). It has been known that some lectins lyse as well as agglutinate cells. These proteins are called hemolytic lectins or toxic lectins. Several of these lectins have been isolated and characterized. One of these representatives is a type 2 ribosome-inactivating protein family (type II RIP) from higher plants, classified on the basis of structural and evolutionary development (2Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Barre A. Rouge P. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1998; 17: 575-692Crossref Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Ricin, a 65-kDa type II RIP from Ricinus communis, is the prototype of this lectin family (3Olsnes S. Kozlov J.V. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 1723-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar); it consists of two disulfide-linked polypeptides, A-chain and B-chain. The A-chain enters the cytosol and inactivates the ribosomes enzymatically, whereas the B-chain, which is composed of two tandemly repeated (QXW)3 domains, has lectin-like properties and binds to β-linked galactose at the cell surface. This binding is a prerequisite for translocation of the A-chain into the cytosol. The properties of a hemolytic lectin from marine invertebrate Cucumaria echinata (CEL-III) have also been well characterized (4Hatakeyama T. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3560-3564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 5Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. Mori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16915-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). CEL-III, a 47-kDa polypeptide, is also composed of two tandemly repeated (QXW)3 domains similar to ricin B-chain and a putative oligomerization domain. CEL-III is a pore-forming protein, which binds to carbohydrates on the cell membrane, forms oligomers, and creates ion-permeable pores. The isolation and partial characterization of an N-acetyllactosamine-specific hemolytic lectin from the mushroom Laetiporus sulfureus were first reported by Konska et al. (6Konska G. Guillot J. Dusser M. Damez M. Botton B. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The hemolytic lectin was isolated by affinity chromatography on Sepharose and was stated to be a heterotetrameric protein of 190 kDa, with subunits of 36 and 60 kDa. In this paper, we have undertaken the detailed sugar binding specificity, cDNA cloning, expression, and characterization of this unique hemolytic lectin and closely related lectins from L. sulfureus. Binding studies by the techniques of hemagglutination, hemolysis inhibition, and quantitative precipitation showed that the lectin possesses an extended binding site, which recognizes Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4Glc (lacto-N-neotetraose). cDNA sequencing revealed that the L. sulfureus lectins contain a (QXW)3-like motif at their N-termini and show sequence homology to bacterial toxins. The three lectin genes and a deletion mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli and their physicochemical characterization is investigated to shed light on the mechanism of hemolysis mediated by their novel-type of structures. Lacto-N-neotetraose, lacto-N-tetraose, lacto-N-neohexaose, and lacto-N-hexaose were purchased from V-LABS (Covington, LA). Unless stated otherwise, saccharides, their derivatives, and glycoproteins (including fetuin, asialofetuin, transferrin, thyroglobulin, α1-acid glycoproteins, bovine submaxillary mucin, etc.) were purchased from Sigma. Except for asialofetuin, asialoglycoproteins were prepared by heating the corresponding native glycoproteins in 0.1 m hydrochloric acid at 80 °C for 1 h, followed by dialysis and lyophilization; the removal of sialic acid was confirmed by the thiobarbituric assay (7Warren L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1971-1975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the Lectin—L. sulfureus mushrooms were harvested in October 2002 in Ann Arbor, MI. Fresh mushrooms were cleaned of debris and chopped into small pieces. The chopped tissue (40 g) was homogenized in a Waring Blendor at 4 °C in 200 ml of PBS 1The abbreviations used are: PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PBSE, phosphate-buffered saline containing EDTA; LSL, L. sulphureus lectin; nLSL, native LSL; nLSL-p1, nLSL purified with PBS as an extraction buffer; nLSL-p2, native L. sulphureus lectin purified with PBSE containing protease inhibitor mixture as an extraction buffer; rLSL, recombinant LSL; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; Me, methyl. (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.04% sodium azide, pH 7.2) or PBSE (PBS containing 1 mm EDTA) containing 1 ml/liter protein inhibitor mixture (product P8215; Sigma). The homogenate was stirred for 3 h at 4 °C, squeezed through four layers of cheesecloth, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant solution, filtered through glass wool to remove a small amount of floating debris was applied onto an affinity column (2.5 × 15 cm) of Sepharose 4B, which had been equilibrated in PBSE. The column was washed with PBSE until the absorbance of the effluent at 280 nm decreased to a minimum value. The affinity adsorbed lectin was eluted with 0.1 m lactose in PBSE and dialyzed against PBSE. Approximately 2 mg of purified lectin were obtained from 40 g of fresh mushroom. Protein and Carbohydrate Estimations—Protein was determined by a method of Lowry et al. (8Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total neutral sugars were determined by the phenol/sulfuric acid method (9DuBois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41197) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was carried out on 0.75-mm slab gels in an alkaline buffer system (Tris glycine, pH 8.3) (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), using a mini-Protean II apparatus (Bio-Rad). BenchMark prestained protein molecular mass standards used in SDS-PAGE were from Invitrogen. Subunit Structure—The subunit structure of purified lectins was determined by gel filtration through a G2000-SWXL Progel-TSK column (30 × 0.78 cm; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) using a Beckman System Gold high-performance liquid chromatography system as described previously (11Winter H.C. Mostafapour K. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14996-15001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and by SDS-PAGE performed on samples with and without heating for 5 min in boiling water, and in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Hemolytic Assay and Hapten Inhibition Assay—Hemolytic activity of the lectins was determined by absorbance at 540 nm because of hemoglobin release. A lectin solution (50 μl) and PBSE (50 μl) as a control were mixed with 50 μl of a 5% suspension of human type A erythrocytes, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 5 min, the absorbance of the supernatant solution was measured at 540 nm against a control. Hapten inhibition was assayed in the same system. Increasing amounts of saccharides in 25 μl were incubated with 25 μl of purified lectin (1 μg) for 30 min at room temperature followed by addition of 50 μl of 5% cell suspension after 30 min. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min followed by centrifugation to remove membranes and intact cells, the absorbance of the supernatant solution was recorded at 540 nm. Hemagglutination Assay and Hapten Inhibition Assay—The hemagglutinating activity of the lectin was determined by a 2-fold serial dilution procedure using formaldehyde-treated (12Novak T.P. Barondes S.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 393: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) human and rabbit erythrocytes as described previously (13Mo H. Winter H.C. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10623-10629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The sample (10 μl) (2-fold serial dilutions in PBSE) was combined with 10 μl of a 2% cell suspension in v-shaped microtiter plates (96-well) and hemagglutination was observed after incubation for 30 min at room temperature. The titer was defined as the reciprocal value of the end point dilution causing hemagglutination. For hapten inhibition of hemagglutination, 10 μl of the serially diluted saccharide solutions were incubated with 10 μl of 8 agglutinin units of the lectin in microtiter plates followed by addition after 30 min of an erythrocyte suspension (20 μl). The lowest concentration of saccharide that visibly decreased the extent of agglutination was defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration. Quantitative Precipitation Assay—Assays were performed by a microprecipitation procedure (14Mo H. Winter H.C. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. Misaki A. Goldstein I.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2609-2615Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Varying amounts of glycoproteins or polysaccharides ranging from 0 to 100 μg were added to 20 μg of the purified lectin in a total volume of 120 μl of PBSE. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the reaction mixtures were stored at 4 °C for 48 h. The precipitates formed were washed twice with 500 μl of ice-cold PBS, dissolved in 0.05 m NaOH, and assayed for protein by Lowry's method (8Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Peptide Sequencing and Analysis—Peptide sequences were determined by the Protein Structure Facility at the University of Michigan Core Facilities. Briefly, purified protein was reduced, S-carboxamidomethylated with monoiodoacetamide, and then digested with trypsin. The derived peptides were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and the amino acid sequences of the isolated peptides were analyzed by a gas-phase protein sequencer. RNA Isolation and cDNA Cloning—Fresh tissue of the mushroom was ground to a powder with a pestle under liquid nitrogen. Total cellular RNA was isolated with Concert Plant RNA reagent (Invitrogen, CA) and subsequently poly(A)+ RNA was isolated with Micro-Fast-Track 2.0 kit (Invitrogen). Using this protocol, 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/1 g of mushroom was isolated. Adapter-ligated cDNA library was constructed with the Marathon cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). Two degenerate forward primers (LSLF1, GCNGTNWSNACNGTNGARWSNGGNATHATHAA; LSLF2, GTNGARWSNGGNATHATHAAYGTNCCNTTYAC) were designed from the amino acid sequence AVSTVDSGIINVPFT of a trypsin-digested fragment of the purified lectin for rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). 3′-RACE was conducted with a combination of primers, adapter primer 1 (Invitrogen) and LSLF1, and Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as follows. DNA was denatured at 94 °C for 3 min, followed by three-step cycles (40 cycles); 92 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 68 °C for 1 min, and further extended at 68 °C for 5 min. The amplified DNA fragment was subsequently amplified with LSLF2 and adapter primer 2 (Invitrogen). The amplified 1-kilobase pair fragment was cloned using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). Inserted DNA was sequenced with T7 and SP6 primers by the DNA Sequencing Core facility of the University of Michigan, and three similar but different genes (termed LSLa, LSLb, and LSLc) including poly(A)+ were obtained. A gene-specific reverse primer (LSLR1, ATCATTGACTTTCGACACGCAACATTGATAGAGC) was designed and 5′-RACE was conducted with adapter primer 1 and LSLR1. Finally, a gene-specific forward primer (LSLF3, CCTAACGTACACGTTACGCTCCCATTCACC) was designed and 3′-RACE was conducted with adapter primer 1 and LSLF3 to confirm full-length cDNA sequences. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant L. sulfureus lectin—The protein coding region of LSL amplified by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides incorporating NdeI and BamHI, or NdeI and XhoI restriction enzyme sites were used for cloning purposes. The approximately 1-kilobase pair PCR products cloned into expression vector pET-43a (Novagen), yielding pET-LSLa, pET-LSLb, and pET-LSLc. A deletion mutant (LSLa-D1) was generated by PCR using the GeneTailor site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen), pET-LSLa as a template, and mutagenesis primers (LSLaD1F, CATCATCCCAGACCCAGGAGTAGTCATTTAAT; LSLaD1R, CTCCTGGGTCTGGGATGATGTATTCTCGAG) following by the manufacturer's protocol. Underlined nucleotides of LSLaD1F (see above) were altered to introduce a stop codon to generate a deletion mutant of LSLa (Met1-Glu187) and the nucleotide sequence of mutant clones was verified by DNA sequencing. Nova Blue (DE3) strain of E. coli harboring expression vector was pre-cultured in 5 ml of Luria broth (LB) medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C for 3 h and was added to 1 liter of medium. After the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.4–0.6, 1 ml of 1 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactoside was added to the medium, and the cells were further cultured at 25 °C overnight. The induced cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in a lysis buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.04% sodium azide, pH 7.2 (PBS), containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics)), and sonicated at 0 °C. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 0 °C. Recombinant lectins were purified from the soluble fraction by absorption on a Sepharose 4B column and elution by 0.2 m lactose. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Japan Spectroscopic Co.) using a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and an optical path length of 1 mm. Buffer baselines were measured under the same conditions and subtracted from the corresponding spectrum. The data were transformed to mean residue molar ellipticity and smoothed using the standard analysis program. Secondary structure was calculated based on the method of Yang et al. (15Yang J.T. Wu C.-S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Sequence Data Processing—Multiple sequence alignment was performed by the Clustal W program (16Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). Homologous sequences were searched for by the FASTA program. Internal repeats were searched for by the SMART program (17Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar, 18Letunic I. Goodstadt L. Dickens N.J. Doerks T. Schultz J. Mott R. Ciccarelli F. Copley R.R. Ponting C.P. Bork P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Hydropathy profile analysis was performed on the basis of the primary structure by the procedure of Kyte and Doolittle (19Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). Purification of the Lectin—Initially, lectin was extracted from L. sulfureus with PBS without protease inhibitors followed by the method of Konska et al. (6Konska G. Guillot J. Dusser M. Damez M. Botton B. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The lectin was adsorbed onto Sepharose 4B and eluted by 0.2 m lactose. SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified lectin (nLSL-p1) revealed the presence of two major bands at 35 and 17 kDa (Fig. 1). The absence of 2-mercaptoethanol in the sample preparation buffer did not change the pattern of bands, indicating the absence of interchain disulfide bonding. A sample prepared without heating showed a major band at approximately 170 kDa and lesser amounts of other bands, suggesting that 35- and 17-kDa subunits are associated into an oligomeric structure that is dissociated by SDS at room temperature (Fig. 1). N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 35- and 17-kDa subunits were identical except for the first two residues (XD) present in the 35-kDa subunit (35-kDa subunit, XDIYIPPEGL; 17-kDa subunit, IYIPPEGLYF), suggesting that the 17-kDa subunit might be a truncated form of the 35-kDa subunit and that the 17-kDa subunit presumably was generated by proteolytic cleavage of the 35-kDa subunit. To prevent any metalloproteinase degradation of the lectin, metal-free buffer containing EDTA and proteinase inhibitor mixture was used throughout subsequent purification. It should be noted that hemagglutination activity of the lectin was unchanged by extensive dialysis of the lectin in metal-free buffer containing EDTA, indicating the absence of a divalent metal ion requirement (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1, upon SDS-PAGE at pH 8.3 with unheated samples, the purified lectin (nLSL-p2) showed a single band at approximately 170 kDa. When the lectin was boiled in SDS with 2-mercaptoethanol, a single band of 35 kDa was observed, suggesting that the native structure is an oligomer of this monomer. This preparation was used for further investigation. Subunit Structure—The molecular mass was also estimated by size exclusion chromatography on a silica-based matrix. The purified lectin migrated as a single, nearly symmetrical band of approximately 140 kDa, based on standardization with known proteins (data not shown). Together with the SDS-PAGE analysis, these results indicate that the lectin exists as a tetramer of subunits of approximately 35 kDa that requires boiling in SDS to dissociate completely. Hemagglutination and Hemolysis—The hemagglutination and hemolytic activity of nLSL was assayed toward erythrocytes from several mammalian species. The lectin agglutinated formaldehyde-treated rabbit erythrocytes at a minimum concentration of approximately 1 ng/ml, whereas formaldehyde-treated sheep, dog, and human erythrocytes of any blood type required 80 or 160 ng/ml for agglutination (Table I). As shown in Fig. 2A, the lectin hemolyzed rabbit, sheep, and human erythrocytes of any blood type in a dose-dependent manner. The concentrations of the lectin required to induce 50% hemolysis were determined to be 0.9, 14, 17, 14, and 17 μg/ml for rabbit, human A, human B, human O, and sheep erythrocytes, respectively. In contrast, dog erythrocytes were only slightly hemolyzed by the lectin (Fig. 2A).Table IHemagglutination (HA) and hemolytic (HL) activity of native and recombinant lectinsCell typeaMinimum concentration required for 50% hemolysis of fresh erythrocytesnLSLrLSLarLSLbLSLa-D1HAaMinimum concentration required for 50% hemolysis of fresh erythrocytesHLbMinimum concentration required for hemagglutination of formaldehyde-treated erythrocytesHAaMinimum concentration required for 50% hemolysis of fresh erythrocytesHLbMinimum concentration required for hemagglutination of formaldehyde-treated erythrocytesHAaMinimum concentration required for 50% hemolysis of fresh erythrocytesHLbMinimum concentration required for hemagglutination of formaldehyde-treated erythrocytesHAaMinimum concentration required for 50% hemolysis of fresh erythrocytesHLbMinimum concentration required for hemagglutination of formaldehyde-treated erythrocytesμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlμg/mlRabbit0.00120.90.04NDcND, not determined0.08ND0.2NDHuman A0.08140.16150.085.21>1000Human B0.08170.3190.167.31>1000Human O0.08140.16170.084.72>1000Sheep0.08170.39>500.60.90.2>1000Dog0.16>3800.63>500.161.815.6>1000a Minimum concentration required for 50% hemolysis of fresh erythrocytesb Minimum concentration required for hemagglutination of formaldehyde-treated erythrocytesc ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Amino Acid Sequencing—N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the electroblotted protein yielded a very weak signal, indicating that the protein is blocked at the N terminal. Despite the weak signal, the sequence XDIYIPPEGL was determined. Enzymatic digestion with trypsin, purification of peptide fragments, and Edman degradation of the tryptic peptides yielded three peptide sequences: AVSTVDSGIINVPFT, STGFEVTTEGI, and GVSSWDLR. Carbohydrate Analysis—Neutral sugar was not detected in the purified lectin by the phenol/sulfuric acid assay. Inhibition of Hemagglutination—The sugar binding specificity of the lectin was initially investigated by hemagglutination inhibition assay (Table II). Of the mono- and disaccharides tested, Meβ-N-acetyllactosaminide was the best inhibitor.Table IIInhibition of hemagglutination activity of native and recombinant lectins by saccharidesSaccharidesnLSLrLSLa PrbPotency relative to lactose with nLSLrLSLb PrbPotency relative to lactose with nLSLLSLa-D1 PrbPotency relative to lactose with nLSLIC50aMinimum concentration required for 50% inhibition of hemagglutination activity of native and recombinant lectins against human type A erythrocytesPrbPotency relative to lactose with nLSLmMGalβ1,4Glc (lactose)6.3[1]222Galβ1,4GlcNAc (LacNAc)1.64244Galβ1,4GlcNAcOMe (Me-β-LacNAc)16.36.36.36.3Galβ1,4Frucf(lactulose)250.30.30.30.3Galβ1,4Glucitol (lactitol)500.130.130.130.13Galβ1,4Man12.50.50.50.50.5Galβ1,3Ara250.30.30.30.3Galβ1,3GalβOMe250.30.30.30.3a Minimum concentration required for 50% inhibition of hemagglutination activity of native and recombinant lectins against human type A erythrocytesb Potency relative to lactose with nLSL Open table in a new tab Inhibition of Hemolysis—The detailed sugar binding properties of the lectin were further elucidated by hemolysis inhibition assay (Fig. 3) and the concentration of saccharides required for 50% inhibition is shown in Table III. Galβ1,4Glc (lactose) was about 4–10 times more active than lactose-related saccharides such as Galβ1,4Man, Galβ1,4Fru (lactulose), and Galβ1,4Glucitol (lactitol). Galβ1,4Gal (galactobiose) showed only 26% inhibition at 12.5 mm. Galβ1,4GlcNAc (N-acetyllactosamine) was approximately twice as active as Galβ1,4Glc, about 8 times more active than Galβ1,3GlcNAc (lacto-N-biose) and Galβ1,3Ara, indicating that the lectin has a preference for the β1,4-linked isomers. The Me- and p-nitrophenyl glycosides of Galβ1,4GlcNAc were the best inhibitors among disaccharides tested, and were 3.8 times more active than Galβ1,4Glc and twice more active than Galβ1,4GlcNAc. Of the oligosaccharides tested, Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc (lacto-N-neo- tetraose) was the best inhibitor, which was about 27 times more active than Galβ1,4Glc, and 4 times more active than Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc and (Galβ1,4GlcNAc)2β1,6 Galβ1,4Glc (lacto-N-neohexaose).Table IIIInhibition of hemolytic activity of native and recombinant lectins by saccharidesSaccharidesNative LSLrLSLa P rbPotency relative to lactose with nLSLrLSLb P rbPotency relative to lactose with nLSLI50aMinimum concentration required for 50% inhibition of hemolytic activity of native and recombinant lectins with human type A erythrocytesP rbPotency relative to lactose with nLSLmMGalβ1,4Glc (lactose)3.0[1]0.81.9pNp-β-lactoside1.91.6NDcND, not determinedNDGalβ1,4GlcNAc (LacNAc)1.42.12.72Me β-LacNAc0.83.84.30.3pNp-β-LacNAc0.83.8NDNDGalβ1,4Frucf (lactulose)14.70.20.160.27Galβ1,4Glucitol (lactitol)27.80.10.130.17Galβ1,4Gal12.5 (26%)dMaximum concentration tested (percentage of inhibition observed)NDNDGalβ1,4Man11.20.270.240.24Galβ1,3GlcNAc (lacto-N-biose)11.50.26NDNDGalβ1,3Ara10.60.280.260.16Galβ1,3GalNAcβOMe7.00.43NDNDGalβ1,3GalαOMe25.40.12NDNDMe β-Gal84.50.04NDND2-Fucosyllactose11.30.27NDND3′-Fucosyllactose23.70.13NDNDGalα1,3lactose15.50.19NDNDGalβ1,3lactose5.50.54NDNDGalβ1,4lactose2.41.25NDNDGalβ1,6lactose2.91.0NDNDLacto-N-hexaose1.392.166<2.3Lacto-N-neohexaose0.535.66103Galβ1,3GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc (Lacto-N-tetraose)0.535.66153.3Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3Galβ1,4Glc (Lacto-N-neotetraose)0.1127.333.34.3a Minimum concentration required for 50% inhibition of hemolytic activity of native and recombinant lectins with human type A erythrocytesb Potency relative to lactose with nLSLc ND, not determinedd Maximum concentration tested (percentage of inhibition observed) Open table in a new tab Quantitative Precipitation—The ability of various glycoproteins and polysaccharides to precipitate the purified nLSL was investigated by the quantitative precipitation assay; among those examined were: both native and desialylated fetuin, α1-acid glycoproteins, thyroglobulin, transferrin, ovine submaxillary mucin, bovine submaxillary mucin, glycophorin, β-tetragalactosylglucose, and pneumococcus type 14 polysaccharide. Although the hemagglutination and hemolytic activity of nLSL was specifically inhibited by lactose and N-acetyllactosamine, asialo α1-acid glycoproteins and asialofetuin, which contain mixtures of N-acetyllactosamine-type N-linked glycans, failed to precipitate the lectin. Of many glycoproteins and polysaccharides examined, only pneumococcus type 14 polysaccharide gave a precipitation curve with nLSL (Fig. 4). Molecular Cloning of L. sulfureus Lectin—3′-RACE with the adapter primers and the degenerate primers that were designed from the trypsin-digested fragment yielded a 1-kilobase pair product. Cloning and sequencing of 5′-RACE products generated three different full-length nucleotide sequences including polyadenylation (termed LSLa, LSLb, and LSLc). Of 17 clones, 9 clones appeared to contain LSLa, whereas 6 clones contained LSLb and 2 clones contained LSLc. LSLa, LSLb, and LSLc contain a 57-bp 5′-untranslated region, followed by a 945-bp open reading frame encoding 315 amino acid residues, and the 218, 122, and 124 bp 3′-untranslated regions, respectively (Fig. 5). None of them contain an adenylation signal sequence. The calculated molecular masses of LSLa (34,964 Da), LSLb (35,150 Da), and LSLc (35,101 Da) without N-terminal Met are in good agreement with the molecular mass of native lectin (35 kDa) estimated by SDS-PAGE. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed that LSLa contains precisely the same sequence as the sequenced peptides of purified lectin, whereas the two other lectins contain slightly different sequences (Fig. 5). No signal sequence could be discerned in the deduced amino acid sequences of the LSLs, indicating their synthesis on free polysomes. LSLa and LSLc have two, and LSLb has one potential N-linked glycosylation site(s) (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) in their sequences (Fig. 5). However, as indicated above, no carbohydrate was detected in the native lectin. These data suggested that LSLa corresponds to the same protein as nLSL. Osmotic Protection of Erythrocytes—Because L. sulfureus lectin showed sequence identity with several pore-forming toxins, it was postulated that the hemolytic activity of the lectin was because of the formation of ion-permeable pores in the membrane. Therefore, osmotic protection experiments were performed in the presence of human type A erythrocyte"
https://openalex.org/W2091379467,"The relationship between tropomyosin thermal stability and thin filament activation was explored using two N-domain mutants of α-striated muscle tropomyosin, A63V and K70T, each previously implicated in familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Both mutations had prominent effects on tropomyosin thermal stability as monitored by circular dichroism. Wild type tropomyosin unfolded in two transitions, separated by 10 °C. The A63V and K70T mutations decreased the melting temperature of the more stable of these transitions by 4 and 10 °C, respectively, indicating destabilization of the N-domain in both cases. Global analysis of all three proteins indicated that the tropomyosin N-domain and C-domain fold with a cooperative free energy of 1.0–1.5 kcal/mol. The two mutations increased the apparent affinity of the regulatory Ca2+ binding sites of thin filament in two settings: Ca2+-dependent sliding speed of unloaded thin filaments in vitro (at both pH 7.4 and 6.3), and Ca2+ activation of the thin filament-myosin S1 ATPase rate. Neither mutation had more than small effects on the maximal ATPase rate in the presence of saturating Ca2+ or on the maximal sliding speed. Despite the increased tropomyosin flexibility implied by destabilization of the N-domain, neither the cooperativity of thin filament activation by Ca2+ nor the cooperative binding of myosin S1-ADP to the thin filament was altered by the mutations. The combined results suggest that a more dynamic tropomyosin N-domain influences interactions with actin and/or troponin that modulate Ca2+ sensitivity, but has an unexpectedly small effect on cooperative changes in tropomyosin position on actin.

Contraction of cardiac and skeletal muscle is controlled by the reversible binding of calcium to the N-domain of TnC, 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, troponin; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. which is the regulatory subunit of troponin (for reviews, see Refs. 1Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar and 2Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Troponin and tropomyosin bestow Ca2+ dependence on the productive interactions of actin and myosin: rapid ATPase activity, generation of force, and generation of movement. Three-dimensional, helical reconstructions of thin filament electron micrographs imply three positions of tropomyosin on the actin surface (3Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These data, supported by x-ray diffraction of thin filaments (4Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2s-7sPubMed Google Scholar), indicate that a major component of regulation consists of tropomyosin sterically interfering with myosin binding to actin. In the absence of Ca2+, much of the myosin-binding site on actin is obscured by tropomyosin. Calcium binding to troponin causes tropomyosin to shift position, exposing much of the myosin-binding site. Strong actinmyosin binding requires a further repositioning of tropomyosin. These findings do not imply that steric interference fully explains regulation. For example, addition of troponin and tropomyosin to bare actin filaments increases actin-myosin affinity, force production, and sliding speed in the presence of Ca2+ (5Tobacman L.S. Butters C.A. J.

Nevertheless, as was first proposed 30 years ago (8Haselgrove J.C. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1972; 37: 341-352Crossref Google Scholar), most recent reports (albeit not all (e.g. Refs. 9Miki M. Miura T. Sano K. Kimura H. Kondo H. Ishida H. Maeda Y. Biochem.

Squire J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 75: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Each muscle tropomyosin binds to one troponin and spans seven actin monomers on the thin filament. This stoichiometry implies that regulation is extended in space, with calcium ions directly affecting a regulatory unit that is seven actins long. Also, tropomyosin polymerizes in solution, and successive troponin-tropomyosin complexes form a continuous strand along the actin filament. Therefore, the thin filament not only undergoes kinetic transitions, but also can have spatial transitions. Any local shift in tropomyosin position on the actin surface, for example caused by a lone, strongly bound cross-bridge, implies spatial transition(s) between actins with tropomyosin in one position, and actins with tropomyosin in another. The highly cooperative behavior of muscle fibers and of isolated thin filaments suggests that these spatial transitions have considerable physiological importance. Thus, the flexibility of tropomyosin on the actin filament is significant for full appreciation of its regulatory function. Recently, a new approach to understanding tropomyosin has been provided by the discovery that tropomyosin missense mutations can cause the autosomal dominant disorder familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Several studies have appeared describing functional effects of these mutations in solution (18Golitsina N. An Y. Greenfield N.J. Thierfelder L. Iizuka K. Seidman J.G. Seidman C.E. Lehrer S.S.

Med. 1999; 5: 1413-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) concerns the first two mutations detected, E180G and D175N, located near where tropomyosin interacts (weakly) with the globular, Ca2+ binding domain of troponin. In examining cardiomyopathic mutations A63V and K70T (26Nakajima-Taniguchi C. Matsui H. Nagata S. Kishimoto T. Yamauchi-Takihara K. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1995; 27: 2053-2058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 27Yamauchi-Takihara K. Nakajima-Taniguchi C. Matsui H. Fujio Y. Kunisada K. Nagata S. Kishimoto T. Heart. 1996; 76: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), located instead in the N-terminal domain of tropomyosin, the current report combines with the earlier evidence to imply that a characteristic result of the cardiomyopathic tropomyosin mutations is to decrease thermal stability, which presumably reports an increased tropomyosin flexibility. Despite these findings, the cooperativity of thin filament activation, either by myosin or by Ca2+, was not altered by the mutations. The data suggest that the flexibility of the tropomyosin N-domain influences Ca2+ sensitivity, but has an unexpectedly small effect on cooperative changes in tropomyosin position on actin. Protein Purification and Construct Design—Bovine cardiac whole troponin was purified as previously described from a heart muscle ether powder (28Tobacman L.S. Adelstein R.S.

Nature. 1975; 257: 54-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) were obtained from rabbit fast skeletal muscle. Recombinant control and mutant bovine tropomyosins were expressed in DE3 cells using vector pET3d, and purified to homogeneity as described (32Strand J. Nili M. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

A63V or K70T mutations were introduced into cDNA encoding rat striated muscle α-tropomyosin by the same PCR-based approach used previously to create other missense mutations (33Tobacman L.S. Lin D.

Both wild type and mutant constructs were designed to include an N-terminal Ala-Ser dipeptide, added to functionally compensate for lack of acetylation of bacterially expressed tropomyosin (34Monteiro P.B.

The coding sequences of the expression plasmids were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at the University of Iowa DNA Facility. Protein Folding and Circular Dichroism—The circular dichroism of tropomyosin (θ222) was monitored using an Aviv DS65 circular dichroism spectrometer, recording as a function of increasing temperature, beginning at 5 °C. To correct for minor differences in protein concentration, data were normalized so that the average ellipticity between 5 and 9 °C was the same for all curves. Conditions were: 0.05 mg/ml tropomyosin, 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 6.5), and either 50 or 300 mm KCl. Data were fit to a model in which N-terminal and C-terminal regions of tropomyosin fold independently, except for a stabilizing cooperative interaction free energy, –ΔG i, for molecules with both regions folded (36Luque I. Leavitt S.A. Freire E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Mutations were assumed to affect the unfolding of the N-domain, i.e. N-domain melting temperature (Tm N) and unfolding enthalpy at this temperature (ΔHm N). The mutations were assumed to have no effect on ΔG i, C-domain melting temperature (Tm C), C-domain unfolding enthalpy (ΔHm C), or the ellipticity of any partially or fully folded state. For each tropomyosin, the partition function describing the relative probabilities of the fully folded, N-domain folded, C-domain folded, and unfolded states takes the form, shown by Equation 1, Σ=1+KCKi+KNKi+KNKCKi,(Eq. 1) where -RTlnKC=ΔHmC(1-T/TmC),(Eq. 2) -RTlnKN=ΔHmN(1-T/TmN),(Eq. 3) and -RTlnKi=ΔGi(ΔGiapproximatedastemperature(T)-invariant).(Eq. 4) Better fits were obtained with the assumption that the ellipticity of the folded state varied linearly with temperature, but this did not qualitatively change the results of the analysis. Actin-activated MgATPase Assays—The thin filament-activated myosin S1 MgATPase rate was measured by serial determinations of [32P]Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP (37Pollard T.D. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4682-4690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rates were linear with time during the initial 10 min used for the assay. In the absence of actin, the myosin S1 MgATPase rate was negligible. Conditions were: 25 °C, 20 mm imidazole HCl (pH 7.5), 3.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 7 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm 1,2-bis-(2-amino-5-bromophenoxy)ethane-N,N,-N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 0.3 μm myosin S1, 7 μm actin (a concentration well below the Km (Ref. 38Tobacman L.S.

The free calcium concentration was controlled by addition of varying concentrations of CaCl2 (39Tobacman L.S. Sawyer D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Myosin S1 to the Thin Filament—Myosin S1-ADP binding to the thin filament was measured as previously described using pyrene-labeled actin, monitoring the decrease in fluorescence intensity as increasing S1 was added. The conditions of the samples (1.8 ml each) were: 0.9 or 0.6 μm actin (at either 25 or 37 °C, respectively), 0.4 μm control or mutant tropomyosin, 0.4 μm troponin, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ADP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm glucose, 12 units of hexokinase, 20 μm P 1,P 5-di(adenosine 5′)-pentaphosphate, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm EGTA, and either 0 or 0.6 mm CaCl2.

Motility Measurements and Analysis—Rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled F-actin was prepared as described previously (41Homsher E. Kim B. Bobkova A. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1881-1892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and used within 2 weeks. Nitrocellulose-coated cover slips and flow cells were prepared as previously described in Ref. 42Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. A heavy meromyosin solution (300 μg/ml) was injected into the chamber. After 2 min of incubation, the solution was replaced by 50 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in assay buffer (25 mm MOPS, 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA (pCa 9), 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). One minute later 50 μl of 20 nm rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled actin was introduced and allowed to incubate for 2 min. This solution was then followed by two 50-μl washes of assay buffer to remove unbound actin. Next an assay buffer solution containing 200 nm tropomyosin and 200 nm troponin was introduced into the chamber and allowed to incubate for 2 min to permit regulatory protein binding to the thin filaments and to confer calcium regulation. Finally, to initiate and sustain motility, 50 μl of a motility solution was introduced into the flow cell. It contained 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.4 or 6.3, depending on the experiment), 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA (containing various ratios of K2EGTA and CaKEGTA depending on the desired pCa), 1 mm Na2ATP, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and photo-bleaching protective agents: 14 mm glucose, 240 units of glucose oxidase/ml, and 9 × 103 units of catalase/ml (both enzymes from Sigma). Troponin and either wild type or mutant tropomyosin were also included in the motility solution at 200 nm concentrations. The ionic strength and pCa of the activating solution were calculated as previously described (42Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flow cell was placed on a temperature-controlled stage (25 °C) of a Leica fluorescence microscope. The rhodamine-phalloidin-labeled regulated actin filaments were visualized using epifluorescence illumination (100-watt mercury arc lamp and a 100×, numeric aperture = 1.3 objective), were imaged on a VE 1000 SIT camera (DAGE-MTI, Michigan City, IN) and were recorded without enhancement on a Panasonic VHS VCR. Quantification of thin filament sliding speed was performed using a Motion Analysis System (Motion Analysis Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA). Data were acquired as previously described (42Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, the motions of >200 filaments were recorded for 20–30 s in each motility assay. The mean sliding speed for each filament was computed. Those moving at speeds less than the noise recorded from non-moving objects were assigned a value of zero, and the average sliding speed under each condition was determined by averaging all the recorded filaments. To further analyze the speed-pCa data, the speeds of every recorded filament (∼ 200 filaments/condition) as a function of pCa were fitted to the Hill equation in the form shown in Equation 5. V=Vmax(1-10n[pCa50-pCa])(Eq. 5) V is the sliding speed at a given pCa, V max is maximal sliding speed at saturating calcium, n is the Hill coefficient, pCa50 is the pCa at which sliding speed is half-maximal, and pCa is the pCa of the measurement. As reported previously (41Homsher E. Kim B. Bobkova A. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1881-1892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the number of filaments sliding at speeds greater than zero increased as the pCa was reduced. Typically, the fraction of filaments sliding at pCa 9 was <0.5%, whereas at pCa < 6 the fraction sliding was >90%. Effects of Tropomyosin Mutations on Thermal Stability— Tropomyosin folding stability is weakened by HCM mutation E180G, and by mutation D175N in pyrene-labeled tropomyosin. Both mutations are located in a tropomyosin region that interacts with troponin, albeit weakly (1Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Similar assessments of folding stability have not been reported for mutations in the N-terminal half of tropomyosin, far from residues directly binding to troponin. However, structural reports suggest that such mutations might alter protein folding. Mutation V95A, located one third of the way from N to C terminus, inserts an alanine in the coiled-coil dimerization core, and clusters of such alanines alter core packing and induce tropomyosin bending (43Brown J.H. Greenfield N.J. Dominguez R. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Lysine 70, eliminated in patients with mutation K70T, forms a stabilizing intrahelical salt bridge with Asp-66 in the x-ray structure of tropomyosin fragment 1–81 (43Brown J.H. Greenfield N.J. Dominguez R. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Cohen C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Of the four identical strands in the unit cell (on two molecules), the one (helix B) with this salt bridge is the most ordered locally, i.e. its C-terminal portion has the lowest refined temperature factors. 2J. H. Brown and C. Cohen, personal communication. Against this background, circular dichroism was employed to monitor protein folding as a function of temperature for wild type tropomyosin and for HCM mutants K70T and A63V (Fig. 1). At intermediate temperatures, each mutation significantly altered θ222, a measure of α-helical content. Wild type tropomyosin unfolded in two distinct transitions, separated by ∼10 °C. The lower temperature transition can be assigned to the more C-terminal portion of tropomyosin, both because previous work indicates that tropomyosin is more stable toward its N terminus (44Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 593-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Mo J. Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 1992; 32: 751-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), and also because these N-terminal mutations primarily alter the higher temperature transition. The N-terminal transition is smaller than the C-terminal transition: ∼98 versus 185 peptide bonds, respectively, based on fitting to the model described below. A63V decreases the N-terminal transition midpoint (Tm N) by 3.7 °C (Table I). For K70T tropomyosin, the shift in Tm N is more pronounced (10.3 °C), and the C-terminal transition also is plainly affected.Table IThermal denaturation of tropomyosins monitored by circular dichroismT mNΔH mNT mCΔH mCΔGi°Ckcal/mol°Ckcal/molkcal/mol50 mm KClWild type47.3 ± 0.198 ± 3A63V43.6 ± 0.177 ± 4K70T36.9 ± 0.145 ± 4All forms35.0 ± 0.3109 ± 21.5 ± 0.1300 mmKClWild type49.6 ± 0.2103 ± 5A63V45.8 ± 0.166 ± 5K70T42.1 ± 0.173 ± 6All forms38 ± 188 ± 21.0 ± 0.3 Open table in a new tab Insight into tropomyosin folding thermodynamics per se, plus further analysis of the mutations, was obtained by global fitting of an equilibrium model to θ222 data from all three molecules. Because two transitions are evident for wild type tropomyosin, the model adopts the approximation that tropomyosin has two folding domains under the examined conditions. The A63V and K70T mutations affect only the more N-terminal domain in the model, i.e. the unfolding enthalpy of the domain (ΔHm N) and/or melting temperature (Tm N). The CD results indicate major changes in these parameters (Table I), implying that the mutations affect the structure and dynamics of a large region of tropomyosin. Furthermore, both mutations also affect (indirectly) the behavior of the more C-terminal portion of tropomyosin, as is particularly evident for K70T. The entire circular dichroism curve is shifted toward lower temperatures, not just the portion of the curve above 40 °C. This shows that cooperative interactions within tropomyosin span virtually the full length of the coiled-coil, and that a tropomyosin point mutation can affect the entire molecule in this sense. Fig. 1 was more precisely analyzed by assuming there is a cooperative interaction free energy (36Luque I. Leavitt S.A. Freire E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 235-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) between two folding domains (–ΔG i), which is lost when either of them unfolds. This is equivalent to stating that the N-and C-terminal regions can fold separately, but that the results imply that folding together is accompanied by a facilitating interaction. In this model, N-domain mutations should have little effect on ΔG i itself, on C-domain folding thermodynamics (Tm C, ΔHm C), or on the relative sizes of C-versus N-domain transitions. With these assumptions, global analysis of all three tropomyosins revealed ΔG i = 1.5 ± 0.1 kcal/mol in the presence of 50 mm KCl and 1.0 ± 0.3 in the presence of 300 mm KCl (Table I). These calculations should be interpreted cautiously, because other experiments (46Suarez M.C. Lehrer S.S. Silva J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1300-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 47Holtzer M.E. Mints L. Angeletti R.H. d'Avignon D.A. Holtzer A.

Additionally, the present data do not permit separate assessment of dimerization, which is omitted from the model. However, the measurement of a significant value for ΔG i implies long range cooperativity within tropomyosin. This is consistent with the folded tropomyosin structure having a continuous α-helix, as is likely from its amino acid sequence.

Near-maximal speed was obtained in the presence of very low Ca2+ concentrations (pCa50 > 7 at pH 7.4), consistent with previous motility data showing that, for unloaded movement, only 15% Ca2+ saturation of troponin is required for near-maximal speed (6Homsher E.

The present study demonstrates that CpG DNA can up-regulate cox-2 expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms in RAW264.7 cells. To determine the CpG DNA-mediated signaling pathway that post-transcriptionally regulates cox-2 expression, a cox-2 translational reporter (COX2–3′-UTR-luciferase) was generated by inserting sequences within the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of cox-2 to the 3′ end of the luciferase gene under control of the SV40 promoter. CpG DNA-induced COX2–3′-UTR-luciferase activity was completely inhibited by an endosomal acidification inhibitor chloroquine, a Toll-like receptor 9 antagonist inhibitory CpG DNA, or overexpression of a dominant negative (DN) form of MyD88. However, overexpression of DN-IRAK-1 or DN-TRAF6 resulted in substantial, but not complete, inhibition of the CpG DNA-induced COX2–3′-UTR-luciferase activity. Activation of all three MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) was required for optimal COX2–3′-UTR-luciferase activity induced by CpG DNA. Overexpression of DN-TRAF6 suppressed CpG DNA-mediated activation of p38 and JNK, but not ERK, explaining the partial inhibitory effects of DN-TRAF6 on CpG DNA-induced COX2–3′-UTR-luciferase activity. Co-expression of DN-TRAF6 and N17Ras completely inhibited CpG DNA-induced COX2–3′-UTR-luciferase activity, indicating the involvement of Ras in CpG DNA-mediated ERK and COX2–3′-UTR regulation. Collectively, our results suggest that MyD88 and MAPKs play a key regulatory role in CpG DNA-mediated cox-2 expression at the post-transcriptional level and that TRAF6 is a diverging point in the Toll-like receptor 9-signaling pathway for CpG DNA-mediated MAPK activation.

A motif of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in a particular nucleotide context (CpG motif, GACGTT for murine and GTCGTT for human) in bacterial DNA is one of the newly identified pathogen-associated molecular patterns and is capable of activating cells of the immune system, including B lymphocytes, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells that play a critical role in directing the host immune response to infection (reviewed in Ref. 1Krieg A.M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 709-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar). The ability of CpG motifs in bacterial DNA to activate innate immunity can be mimicked by synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides containing the CpG motif (CpG DNA). CpG DNA is endocytosed by leukocytes, acidified, and then recognized by a pattern recognition receptor, Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), 1The abbreviations used are: TLR9, Toll-like receptor 9; COX, cyclooxygenase; UTR, untranslated region; DN, dominant negative; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IRAKs, IL-1R-associated kinases; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IFN, interferon; PG, prostaglandin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ARE, AU-rich element; ActD, actinomycin D; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase.1The abbreviations used are: TLR9, Toll-like receptor 9; COX, cyclooxygenase; UTR, untranslated region; DN, dominant negative; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; IRAKs, IL-1R-associated kinases; TRAF6, tumor necrosis factor-α receptor-associated factor 6; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL, interleukin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IFN, interferon; PG, prostaglandin; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ARE, AU-rich element; ActD, actinomycin D; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase. in an endosomal compartment (2Yi A.-K.

Prostaglandins (PGs) play a critical role in several physiological and pathophysiological processes including inflammatory responses, bone development, wound healing, reproductive function, and blood clotting (reviewed in Refs. 29Smith W.L.

The biosynthesis of PGs is tightly controlled by the activity of the COX enzymes that convert arachidonic acid to PGs (31DeWitt D.L. Biochim. Biophys.

There are two isoforms of COX, cox-1 and cox-2, produced from differently regulated genes. cox-1 is constitutively expressed in most cell types and is thought to be involved in the maintenance of physiological functions (33Funk C.D.

Post-transcriptional regulation is critical in determining the strength and duration of cox-2 gene induction by external stimuli, yet is poorly understood. The 3′-UTR of cox-2 is highly conserved across species and contains an AU-rich element (ARE) with multiple repeats of the regulatory sequence AUUUA (45Cok S.J. Morrison A.R. J. Biol.

In particular, it has been demonstrated that activation of p38 leads to the activation of MAPKAPK-2, which in turn activates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27). HSP27 has been shown to be involved in cox-2 mRNA stability via AUF1 (48Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

Hoshino K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Of the three MAPKs activated by CpG DNA, p38, by leading to activation of the transcription factor cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, plays a critical regulatory role in the CpG DNA-mediated transcriptional regulation of cox-2 expression (28Yeo S.J. Gravis D. Yoon J.G. Yi A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22563-22573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, previous studies have not addressed whether CpG DNA induces cox-2 mRNA stabilization nor have they determined what are the relative contributions of different TLR9/MyD88-signaling mediators to CpG DNA-induced cox-2 post-transcriptional regulation in macrophages. In the present study, we have demonstrated that CpG DNA up-regulates cox-2 expression, at least in part, through post-transcriptional regulation mechanisms that include mRNA stabilization. CpG DNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of cox-2 expression is dependent on the endosomal processing of CpG DNA and the TLR9/MyD88-dependent signaling pathway. In addition, our results demonstrated that all three MAPKs (ERK, p38, and JNK) are required for the CpG DNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of cox-2 expression and that TRAF6 only partially contributes to this post-transcriptional regulation process, due to its differential regulation of the different MAPKs. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that CpG DNA induces activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ras, and this CpG DNA-activated Ras, presumably through activation of ERK, positively regulates CpG DNA-mediated cox-2 expression at the post-transcriptional level. Oligodeoxynucleotides—Nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (S-ODN) were purchased from Operon (Alameda, CA) and further purified by ethanol precipitation. S-ODN had no detectable endotoxins by Limulus assay.

In some experiments, RAW264.7 cells pretreated with CpG DNA (3 μg/ml) for 12 h were stimulated with medium, CpG DNA (3 μg/ml), or non-CpG DNA (3 μg/ml) for the designated times in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD; 10 μg/ml) to inhibit new mRNA transcription. Cells were harvested, and total RNA was isolated by using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten μg of total RNA served as the template for single strand cDNA synthesis in a reaction using oligo(dT) primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Forward and reverse primers were designed using primer Express software (PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems). GAPDH was used for an internal control. The sequences of real time PCR primers used are as follows: cox-2 sense, 5′-CAGAACCGCATTGCCTCTG-3′ and cox-2 antisense, 5′-TTGAAGGTGTCGGGCAGC-3′; GAPDH sense, 5′-TTCACCACCATGGAGAAGGC-3′ and GAPDH antisense, 5′-GGCATGGACTGTGGTCATGA.

https://openalex.org/W1991693578,"To identify domains of the ryanodine receptor (RyR1) that are functionally relevant for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling <i>in vivo</i>, we have studied the ability of RyR1/RyR3 chimera to rescue skeletal EC coupling in dyspedic myotubes. In this work we show that chimeric receptors containing amino acids 1–1,680 of RyR1 were able to render depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to RyR3. Within this region, residues 1,272–1,455, containing divergent domain D2 of RyR1, proved to be a critical element because the absence of this region selectively abolished depolarization-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients without affecting chemically induced activation. Although the D2 domain by itself failed to restore skeletal EC coupling to RyR3, the addition of the D2 region resulted in a dramatic enhancement of EC coupling restored by an RyR3 chimera containing amino acids 1,681–3,770 of RyR1. These results suggest that although the D2 domain of RyR1 plays a key role during EC coupling, additional region(s) from the N-terminal end of RyR1 as well as previously identified regions of the central portion of the receptor are needed in order to allow normal EC coupling."
https://openalex.org/W2012421691,"Recent studies have revealed that G-protein-coupled receptors contain a putative cytoplasmic helical domain, helix 8. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) receptor 1 derivatives with truncated or mutated helix 8 showed much higher LTB4 binding than wild-type (WT) receptors. Similar to the WT receptor, LTB4 promoted guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding in these mutants. Unlike the WT receptor, however, the addition of GTPγS did not inhibit LTB4 binding to the mutant receptors. Scatchard analyses revealed that mutants maintained high affinity for LTB4, even in the presence of excess GTPγS. Consistently, mutant receptors showed a more prolonged Ca2+ mobilization and cellular metabolic activation than the WT receptor. From mutational studies and three-dimensional modeling based on the structure of bovine rhodopsin, we conclude that the helix 8 of LTB4 receptor 1 plays an important role in the conformational change of the receptor to the low affinity state after G-protein activation, possibly by sensing the status of coupling Gα subunits as GTP-bound.

In general, ligand binding to GPCR results in a conformational change of the receptor that stimulates the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins. All GPCRs are believed to share a common three-dimensional structure consisting of seven α-helical transmembrane (TM) domains connected by three intracellular (i1, i2, and i3) and extracellular (e1,e2, and e3) loops with intracellular C-terminal and extracellular N-terminal tails. The extracellular and transmembrane regions of the receptor are involved in ligand binding, whereas the intracellular surface is important for the activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins (3Hall R.A. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 927-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Recent studies reveal that the cytoplasmic tails of GPCRs have important roles, such as receptor trafficking, desensitization, dimerization, and intracellular signaling (4Marshall F.H.

Studies have also shown that segments of the proximal C-terminal tail after the seventh transmembrane domain (TM7) in GPCRs are crucial for receptor transport to the cell surface. Naturally occurring truncations before TM7 of rhodopsin and vasopressin (V2) receptor result in endoplasmic reticulum-arrested receptor transport, leading to the inherited diseases retinitis pigmentosa and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, respectively (11Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Truncations within the proximal C terminus of V2 and luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptors also impair their transport, whereas deletions of more distal portions have no effect (12Rodriguez M.C.

Analyses of the crystal structure of rhodopsin confirmed the presence of seven TM helices and revealed the existence of an eighth cytoplasmic helix (helix 8) that projects at a right angle from the C terminus of TM7. This short amphiphilic helix is anchored by palmitoyl groups to the cytoplasmic surface of the cell membrane. Marin et al. (21Marin E.P. Krishna A.G. Zvyaga T.A. Isele J. Siebert F. Sakmar T.P. J.

LTB4 mainly activates leukocytes and plays important roles in host defense and inflammation (26Samuelsson B. Dahlen S.E. Lindgren J.A. Rouzer C.A. Serhan C.N. Science. 1987; 237: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). These actions of LTB4 are mediated by specific cell surface receptors, LTB4 receptors (BLTs) (27Brink C. Dahlen S.E.

Two GPCRs for LTB4 have been cloned in our laboratory and shown to have distinct ligand binding profiles and tissue distribution (28Yokomizo T. Kato K. Terawaki K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Exp.

Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). hBLT1 is a small GPCR with 352 amino acids and a relatively long C-terminal tail of 64 amino acids (30Yokomizo T. Masuda K. Kato K. Toda A. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 161: S51-S55Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The proximal C terminus of hBLT1 contains a putative amphiphilic short helix, and this region is highly conserved among human, guinea pig (31Masuda K. Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem.

Commun. 1999; 262: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we report that the putative helix 8 of BLT1 is responsible for critical conformational changes of the receptor. The helix 8 might work as a scaffold for G-proteins, changing it to the low affinity state to release the ligand and signal shutdown.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—LTB4 was a generous gift from Ono Pharmaceutical Co. (Osaka, Japan). [3H]LTB4 (6016.2 GBq/mmol) and [35S]GTPγS (46.2 TBq/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.Mutagenesis of Human BLT1—Hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged hBLT1 at N terminus was generated by PCR using a human BLT1 expression vector (pLTBR) (29Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) as a template. The oligonucleotide primers were 5′-cgggatcccgccatgtacccctacgacgtgcccgactacgccaacactacatcttctgcagc-3′ (sense) and 5′-ggaattcctagttcagttcgtttaacttg-3′ (antisense). C-terminal deletion mutants (hBLT1dc323, 312, 305, 297, and 290) were generated by PCR using human HA-tagged hBLT1 as a template. The overlapping PCR method (54Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 13.36-13.39Google Scholar) was used to generate the hBLT1deletions hBLT1LLAA and hBLT1V301A. The sequence of each construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing (model 3100; Applied Biosystems).Cell Culture, Transfection, and Flow Cytometry—Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293 and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °Cin5%CO2. These cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. After 48 h, the cells were fixed with PBS(–) containing 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 5 min and blocked with PBS(–) containing 2% goat serum (Invitrogen) (PBS/GS) for 5 min. The cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Diagnostics) or 2 μg/ml control rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS/GS for 30 min, followed by staining with 10 μg/ml Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed twice with PBS/GS and analyzed with a flow cytometer, EPICS XL (Coulter Electronics Ltd.). An EPICS ALTRA (Coulter Electronics Ltd.) was used for cell sorting.Ligand Binding Assay (Intact Cells)—Ligand binding assays were performed using HEK293 or CHO cells plated in 24-well plates. 48 h after transfection, cells were washed with Hepes-Tyrode's BSA buffer (HTBSA, 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 12 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mm. d-glucose, 0.37 mm NaH2PO4, 0.49 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA (Fraction V, Sigma-Aldrich)) and then incubated with 0.5 nm [3H]LTB4/HTBSA at room temperature for 1 h. After washing 3 times with HTBSA, cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100, and the radioactivities were counted. For determination of nonspecific binding, at least a 1000 times higher concentration of unlabeled LTB4 was added to the binding mixture.Membrane Preparation and Western Blotting—Cells were harvested, homogenized in ice-cold homogenize buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)) and centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in the homogenize buffer. The protein concentration in each sample was measured by the Bradford method (protein assay kit, Bio-Rad). In some experiments, asparagine-linked (N-linked) carbohydrate moieties were removed with endoglycosidase F essentially according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Protein samples were separated in 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking with 5% skim milk in TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6), the blots were probed with 0.1 μg/ml anti-HA antibody (3F10, Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h. The membrane were then washed with TBST and incubated with 0.4 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. The proteins were visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Bioscience).Immunocytochemistry—Forty-eight h after transfection, HEK293 cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS(–) for 10 min and blocked with PBS/GS for 5 min. The cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml anti-HA antibody in PBS/GS for 30 min followed by staining with 10 μg/ml Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were washed with PBS(–) twice and analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 510 (Zeiss).Cell Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—3 × 105 HEK293 cells/well were transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent in 6-well plates. 24 h after transfection, the cells were replated into 96-well plates (2 × 104 cells/well). After 48 h, cells were washed with HTBSA and then incubated with LTB4 or PAF in HTBSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS(–) for 10 min and blocked with PBS(–) containing 5% BSA for 1 h. The cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-HA antibody or control rat IgG in PBS(–) for 1 h followed by staining with 2 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS(–) for 1 h. The cells were washed with PBS(–) and incubated with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich) at the concentration of 1 mg/ml for 20–30 min, and the optical densities at 405 nm were measured with a microplate reader (Bio-Rad).GTPγS Binding Assay—The experiments were done as reported by Fukushima et al. (33Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. The membrane proteins (16 μg) were incubated in 100 μl of GTPγS binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% BSA, and 5 μm GDP) containing 0.5 nm [35S]GTPγS and various concentrations of LTB4 for 30 min at 30 °C. For determination of the nonspecific binding, unlabeled GTPγS was added to the binding mixture to a final concentration of 20 μm. The bound [35S]GTPγS was separated from free [35S]GTPγS by rapid filtration through GF/C filters (Packard) and washed with 2 ml of ice-cold TMN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 mm MgCl2). The radioactivities of the filters were determined using a Top Count scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.).Inhibition of LTB4 Binding by GTPγS—The membrane protein (12 μg) was incubated in 100 μlofLTB4 binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, and 0.05% BSA) containing 0.2 nm [3H]LTB4 with various concentrations of GTPγS. For determination of the nonspecific binding, unlabeled LTB4 was added to the binding mixture to a final concentration of 1 μm. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by rapid filtration through GF/C filters and washing with 2 ml of LTB4 binding buffer. The radioactivities were measured as described above.Scatchard Analyses of hBLT1 and hBLT1dc290 with/without GTPγS—The membrane protein (10 μg) was incubated in 100 μl of LTB4 binding buffer containing 0.4–5 nm [3H]LTB4 in the presence or absence of 100 μm GTPγS. The radioactivities were measured as described above.Calcium Mobilization Assay—3 × 105 CHO cells were cultured on glass bottom dishes for 16 h and loaded with 3 μm Fura2/AM (Dojin, Kumamoto, Japan) in HTBSA buffer containing 0.01% (w/v) cremophor EL (Sigma) at 37 °C for 1 h and further incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were stimulated with ligands at room temperature. Fluorometric cell images were recorded with an ICCD camera/image analysis system (ARGUS-50, Hamamatsu Photonics), and the ratio (340 and 380 nm) was determined.Cytosensor Microphysiometer Studies—5 × 105 CHO cells were seeded into 12-mm Transwell inserts (3-μm pore size) and cultured for 16 h. Capsules were placed in sensor chambers and maintained by a flow (100 μl/min) of modified RPMI1640 (Molecular Devices). The flow was stopped for 40 s at the end of each 2-min pump cycle. The changes in the extracellular acidification rate were measured with the cytosensor microphysiometer (Molecular Devices).hBLT1 Structure Modeling Based on Rhodopsin Structure—hBLT1 atomic model was constructed based on that of bovine rhodopsin with homology modeling as a rhodopsin sub-family member of GPCR (19Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of these seven transmembrane proteins were aligned after the transmembrane sequence alignment in the GPCR data base (34Horn F. Vriend G. Cohen F.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The O software (35Jones T.A. Thirup S. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 819-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar) was used to replace amino acid residues according to the sequence alignment from bovine rhodopsin to hBLT1 on the atomic model of the bovine rhodopsin (PDB code 1F88) (19Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4984) Google Scholar). Finally the structural idealization with molecular dynamics using the CNS software (36Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16926) Google Scholar) was applied to the hBLT1 model. hBLT1 model constructed was checked by the Procheck software (37Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar).RESULTSExpression and [3H]LTB4 Binding Activity of WT-hBLT1 and the Mutants—To analyze the function of the hBLT1 C terminus we constructed serially deleted mutants of hBLT1 as shown in Fig. 1A. Edmundson wheel analysis predicts that the proximal C terminus of BLT1 forms an amphiphilic helix from Val-298 to Gly-307 (Fig. 1B). We constructed a hBLT1deletion that lacks 8 amino acids between Val-298 and Leu-305, hBLT1LLAA in which Leu-304–Leu-305 were substituted for Ala-Ala, and hBLT1V301A in which Val-301 was substituted for Ala (Fig. 1C). The functional properties of these mutants were tested by [3H]LTB4 binding assay using intact cells after transient transfection with expression plasmids for the various mutant receptors (Fig. 2). We found that hBLT1dc297 and hBLT1dc290 showed much higher [3H]LTB4 binding than WT-hBLT1 when transfected into HEK293 cells (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed in CHO cells (Fig. 2B). hBLT1deletion and hBLT1LLAA also showed much higher [3H]LTB4 binding than WT-hBLT1, and hBLT1V301A showed relatively higher [3H]LTB4 binding than WT-hBLT1 (Fig. 2C). Expression levels of these receptors on the cell surface were analyzed by staining with anti-HA antibody specific to the N-terminal HA tag and Alexa-Fluor-488-conjugated secondary antibody followed by flow cytometry. Fig. 3A shows the results of flow cytometric experiments using HEK293 cells transfected with WT- and mutated hBLT1. Expression levels of the hBLT1 mutants were comparable with those of WT-hBLT1 judging from percentages of positively stained cells and the means of fluorescence intensity. The other mutants also showed similar expression (data not shown). Membrane fractions of HEK293 cells transfected with WT-hBLT1 and hBLT1dc290 were analyzed by Western blotting. WT-hBLT1 and hBLT1dc290 appear as diffuse and multiple bands (30–100 kDa) which are commonly observed for most GPCRs (Fig. 3B). After treatment with N-glycosidase F, these receptors migrated with the predicted molecular masses of 36 kDa. These results suggest that hBLT1 is glycosylated at one or both of two putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn-2 and Asn-164) presumably (Fig. 1A) and that expression levels of hBLT1dc290 were almost comparable with those of WT-BLT1. Surface expressions of WT-hBLT1 and hBLT1dc290 were also visualized by immunofluorescent staining with an anti-HA antibody, indicating that both WT and mutant receptors were expressed properly on the cell surface (Fig. 3C). We concluded that surface expression of WT-hBLT1 and the mutants was comparable.Fig. 2[3H]LTB4 binding to WT-hBLT1 and the mutants. 105 HEK293 (A and C) and 2 × 105 CHO (B) cells were transfected with 0.4 μg of expression vector. After 48 h, the cells were bound with 0.5 nm [3H]LTB4 with/without 1 μm LTB4. The total binding (filled squares) and the nonspecific binding (open squares) are presented (means ± S.D., n = 4). A and C are typical of at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 3Cell surface expression of WT-hBLT1 and the mutants. A, HEK293 cells were transfected with WT-hBLT1 or various mutant constructs.

B, Western blotting of WT-hBLT1 and the mutant. Membrane fractions of HEK293 cells transfected with an empty vector (lane 1 and 2), WT-hBLT1 (lane 3 and 4), or hBLT1dc290 (lane 5 and 6) were examined for receptor expression by anti-HA antibody. Samples in lanes 1, 3, and 5 were without treatment (10 μg of total protein per lane). Samples in lanes 2, 4, and 6 were treated with N-glycosidase F (N-GlyF; 3 μg of total protein per lane). MW, molecular mass. C, WT-hBLT1 and hBLT1dc290 expressed in HEK293 cells were visualized by anti-HA antibody.

Greater internalization by mutant receptors could explain why the mutants exhibited higher [3H]LTB4 binding, i.e. more of the ligand becomes trapped inside the cells. To assess the receptor internalization cell surface receptors were quantified by cell-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before and after agonist stimulation. As previously described, PAFR rapidly internalized after exposure to 1 nm PAF, but not following exposure to LTB4 (Fig. 4A) (17Ishii I. Saito E. Izumi T. Ui M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9878-9885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, WT-hBLT1 and hBLT1dc290 did not internalize after 1 h exposure to LTB4 at concentrations as high as 100 nm. In similar experiments performed using HEK293 cells transiently transfected with these receptors, WT-hBLT1 and hBLT1dc290 did not internalize as well (Fig. 4C). Pretreatment with concanavalin A or 0.45 m sucrose, both of which are known to inhibit receptor internalization (38Ohshima N. Ishii S. Izumi T. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9722-9727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), did not alter the results of [3H]LTB4 binding assay using HEK cells expressing WT-hBLT1 and the mutants (data not shown). Thus, internalization could not explain the enhanced LTB4 binding to the mutants.Fig. 4Agonist-induced internalization of WT-hBLT1 and hBLT1dc290. A, CHO cells stably expressing HA-tagged human PAFR and control cells were incubated with 0–100 nm PAF or LTB4 for 1 h at room temperature.

In this background of AZT resistance, additional “suppressive” substitutions such as Y181C restore sensitivity to AZT. In order to characterize the mechanism of this AZT resistance suppression, the Y181C substitution was introduced into both wild-type and AZT-resistant reverse transcriptase. The introduction of the Y181C substitution suppresses the increased repair (or unblocking) of the AZTMP-terminated primer provided by the AZT resistance substitutions in RT using either DNA or RNA templates, independently from the RT RNase H activity. Contrary to wild-type RT, the low level of unblocking activity is not due to inhibition by the next correct nucleotide binding to the RT/AZTMP-terminated primer complex. When Y181C is added to the AZT resistance substitutions, ATP binds with less affinity to the AZTMP-terminated primer-RT binary complex. These results provide an insight into one possible molecular mechanism of re-sensitization of AZT-resistant viruses by suppressive substitutions.

Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar). 3′-Azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT, zidovudine) is such an analogue and was the first drug approved against HIV-1 (8Mitsuya H. Weinhold K.J. Furman P.A. St Clair M.H. Lehrman S.N. Gallo R.C. Bolognesi D. Barry D.W. Broder S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7096-7100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). However, HIV-1 mutants escaping AZT inhibition were isolated soon after the introduction of AZT in the clinic (9Larder B. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 205-222Google Scholar). Genotypic analyses of these viruses have shown that a typical pattern of amino acid substitutions occurred in the pol gene encoding the viral RT. Resistance to AZT is acquired through the selection of specific substitutions such as M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215F or T215Y, and K219Q in the RT molecule. These mutations, termed “TAMs” for thymidine-associated mutations, can confer >100-fold resistance to HIV-1 against AZT and d4T (stavudine) (7Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar, 9Larder B. Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 205-222Google Scholar). The first phenotypic difference between wild-type and AZT-resistant RT to be identified in vitro was the increased processivity of RNA-directed DNA synthesis catalyzed by the D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q RT compared with that of wild-type RT (10Caliendo A.M. Savara A. An D. DeVore K. Kaplan J.C. D'Aquila R.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2146-2153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Canard et al. (11Canard B. Sarfati S.R. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14596-14604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have shown that AZT-resistant RT binds in a different manner to AZTMP-terminated DNA chains than wild-type RT, suggesting that AZT resistance might be an RT-mediated repair mechanism. Subsequently, it was shown that one AZT resistance mechanism involves repair of the AZTMP-terminated primer either by ATP (12Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) or inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) (13Arion D. Kaushik N. McCormick S. Borkow G. Parniak M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15908-15917Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These repair reactions have in common the nucleophilic attack of a hydroxyl group from either the γ-phosphate of ATP or PPi on the terminal phosphodiester bond of the AZTMP-terminated DNA primer. The product of this repair reaction is a free 3′-OH group allowing DNA synthesis to resume. A class of non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as nevirapine, inhibits HIV-1 by a different mechanism than chain termination (14Pauwels R. Andires K. Desmyter J. Schols D. Kukla M.J. Bresline H.J. Raeymaeckers A. Van Gelder J. Woestenborghs R. Heykants J. Schellekens K. Janssen M.A.C. De Clercq E. Janssen P.A.J.

A. 1991; 88: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, NNRTIs are effective against AZT-resistant mutant viruses (16Richman D. Rosenthal A.S. Skoog M. Eckner R.J. Chou T.C. Sabo J.P. Merluzzi V.J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Nevirapine is a potent, highly specific inhibitor that binds to HIV-1 RT by a mechanism that is noncompetitive with respect to primer, template, initiation tRNALys3, and nucleotide (17Merluzzi V.J. Hargrave K.D. Labadia M. Grozinger K. Skoog M. Wu J.C. Shih C.K. Eckner K. Hattox S. Adams J. Rosehthal A.S. Faanes R. Eckner K. Koup R.A. Sullivan J.L.

This inhibitor binds to conserved residues tyrosine 181 and 188 of the p66 subunit of RT in a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the polymerase-active site. The Nevirapine-binding site is defined by two β-sheets from amino acid residues 100-110 and 180-190, respectively (18Wu J.C. Warren T.C. Adams J. Proudfoot J. Skiles J. Raghavan P. Perry C.

Science. 1992; 256: 1783-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). In contrast to AZT resistance, high level resistance to Nevirapine can be conferred by a single mutation at codon 181 (Tyr to Cys) (21Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 2664-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Introduction of this change into either the recombinant enzyme or virus increases the median inhibitory concentration (IC50) 100-fold for Nevirapine (22Richman D. Shih C.K. Lowy I. Rose J. Prodanovich P. Goff S. Griffin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11241-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). While conferring resistance to NNRTI, however, the Y181C substitution in an AZT-resistance background (D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q) suppresses AZT resistance, i.e. restores AZT sensitivity to wild-type levels (21Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 2664-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). These types of substitutions conferring resistance to a drug while annihilating resistance to another drug have been termed “suppressive” substitutions. Among the most clinically relevant are L74V, M184V, or Y181C, which suppress AZT resistance while conferring resistance to didanosine, lamivudine, and nevirapine, respectively (21Larder B.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1992; 36: 2664-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 23St. Clair M.H. Martin J.L. Tudor-Williams G. Bach M.C. Vavro C.L. King D.M. Kellam P. Kemp S.D.

A. 1993; 90: 5653-5656Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Sensitization to AZT by M184V is the only substitution for which suppression has been studied at the enzyme level. AZT sensitization is observed both in the presence and the absence of the mutations that confer resistance to AZT and affects repair of the AZTMP-terminated primer (25Götte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3579-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 26Boyer P.L. Sarafianos S.G. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3248-3256Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A detailed mechanistic view of drug resistance suppression is thus lacking. Understanding the mechanisms of drug resistance and drug resistance suppression may provide a basis for a rational combination of drugs of sustained efficacy (6Balzarini J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 25Götte M. Arion D. Parniak M.A. Wainberg M.A. J.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have introduced the Y181C substitution into both wild-type and AZT-resistant RT, purified the corresponding enzymes, and studied their biochemical properties toward AZT resistance. In this report, we show that the Y181C substitution does not change nucleotide selectivity in a manner consistent with AZT resistance suppression, but suppresses repair of the AZTMP-terminated DNA chain by ATP and PPi. Proteins, Reagents, Expression, and Purification of Enzymes—Wild-type and AZT-resistant (D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q) RT gene constructs have been described (28Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Both plasmids were used to construct mutant RT genes bearing Y181C and D67N/K70R/Y181C/T215Y/K219Q/Y181C substitutions by using synthetic oligonucleotides and a strategy described previously (29Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The RNaseH- version of the four RTs studied here was obtained after introduction of the E478Q substitution using the same approach (30Schatz O. Cromme F.V. Grüninger-Leitch F. Le Grice S.F. FEBS Lett. 1989; 257: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and nucleotide sequencing to confirm that no unwanted changes were introduced. Recombinant RTs were co-expressed with the HIV-1 protease in Escherichia coli to obtain p66/p51 heterodimers, which were later purified to homogeneity by using affinity chromatography as described (29Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RTs were assayed by active-site titration as described before (29Boretto J. Longhi S. Navarro J.M. Selmi B. Sire J. Canard B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen. Oligonucleotides were 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). All γ-32P-labeled adenosine 5′-triphosphate, 2′-deoxy, and 2′,3′-dideoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphates were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. AZT 5′-triphosphate was synthesized and purified as described (28Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage MS2 genomic RNA was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Pre-steady State Kinetics of a Single Nucleotide Incorporation into DNA—Pre-steady state kinetics were performed using AZTTP and dTTP in conjunction with wild-type, AZT-resistant RT, and AZT-resistant/Y181C as described (31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA/DNA primer-template used for the rapid reactions was a 5′-labeled 21-mer primer (5′-ATA CTT TAA CCA TAT GTATCC-3′) annealed to a 31-mer template 31T-RT (5′-TTT TTT TTT AGG ATA CAT ATGGTT AAA GTA T-3′) for the incorporation of dTTP and AZTTP. The formation of product (P) over time was fitted with a burst Equation 1, (P)=A·(1-exp(-(kapp·t))+ksst(Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude of the burst, k app is the apparent kinetic constant of formation of the phosphodiester bond, and k ss is the kinetic constant of the steady state, linear phase. Although curve fitting was better with an equation containing two exponential terms (32Wohrl B.M. Krebs R. Goody R.S. Restle T. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 33Rigourd M. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. J. Biol.

K d and k pol were determined from curve-fitting using the Kaleidagraph software. These constants were used to calculate preference and resistance as described previously (34Reardon J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4473-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 35Deval J. Selmi B. Boretto J. Egloff M.P. Guerreiro C. Sarfati S. Canard B. J. Biol.

Pyrophosphorolysis and ATP-mediated Repair Assays—The primer-template system used for pyrophosphorolysis and ATP-mediated repair assays was a 5′-32P-end-labeled 21-mer DNA primer (5′-ATACTTTAACCATATGTATCC-3′) annealed to a 31-mer (5′-UUUUUUUUUAGGAUACAUAUGGUUAAAGUAU-3′) RNA template or a 35-mer (5′-GGTCCGTTGCATGCGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) DNA template. The single template A specifying a single thymidine insertion site 1 or 4 bases away (RNA and DNA template, respectively) from the 3′ end of the primer is shown in boldface. DNA polymerization was initiated by the addition of wild-type or mutant RT (100 nm) in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) and nucleotides (25 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 5 μm analogue-TP (AZTTP)) in 6 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. The repair reaction was started by adding dTTP to reach a final concentration of 25 μm in the presence of either PPi or ATP, as indicated. Aliquots were withdrawn during the time course of the reaction, and products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (28Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The % repair of blocked primer is the ratio ×100 of extension products larger than 22 or 25 nucleotides over those larger than 21 or 24 nucleotides (for RNA or DNA template, respectively). Values were calculated as averages from three independent experiments and differed by less than 10%. ATP-mediated Repair Assays on a Primed Bacteriophage MS2 RNA Template—The primer-template system used for ATP-mediated repair assays was a 5′-32P-end-labeled 21-mer DNA primer (5′-AGCTACCGAGGAGAGCTCGCT-3′) annealed to a bacteriophage MS2 single-stranded RNA template (GenBank™ accession number V00642). The template A specifying the first possible thymidine insertion site was 10 bases away from the 3′ end of the primer. Primer-template was mixed with wild-type or mutants RT (100 nm) in RT buffer, and polymerization was initiated by the addition of nucleotide mixture (50 μm each of dATP, dCTP, and dGTP) and 10 μm analogue-TP (AZTTP) in 6 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. The repair reaction was started by adding dTTP to reach a final concentration of 50 μm in the presence of ATP, as indicated. Aliquots were withdrawn during the time course of the reaction, and products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (28Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The % repair of blocked primer is the ratio ×100 of extension products larger than 31 nucleotides over those larger than 30 nucleotides. Values were calculated as averages from three independent experiments and differed by less than 10%. ATP-mediated Repair in the Presence of the Next Correct Nucleotide dGTP—The primer-template system used for ATP-mediated repair assays was a 5′-32P-enlabeled 24-mer DNA primer (5′-ATACTTTAACCATATGTATCCGCA-3′) annealed to a 35-mer (5′-GGTCCGTTGCATGCGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) DNA template (25 nm). The single template A specifying a single thymidine insertion site 1 base away from the 3′ end of the primer is shown in boldface. The AZTMP-terminated primer-DNA template was synthesized by the addition of wild-type or mutant RT (10 nm) and 5 μm analogue-TP (AZT-TP) for 15 min at 37 °C in RT buffer. The repair reaction was started by the addition of ATP (3.2 mm), dTTP, dCTP, and dATP (25 μm each), and the next correct nucleotide dGTP to reach various final concentrations (5, 25, 100, 250, 500, 750, and 1000 μm). Aliquots were withdrawn during the time course of the reaction, and the reaction was stopped with EDTA/formamide. The rate of repair was determined during the linear phase of the reaction (between 0 and 60 min), using denaturing gel electrophoresis analysis. Under all conditions tested, the 15-min time point was found to be in the linear phase of the initial reaction rate. The percentage of inhibition was thus calculated at this time point for all next correct nucleotide concentrations. The percent inhibition relative to the uninhibited reaction was plotted against the concentration of dGTP, and data were fitted to a hyperbola to obtain the IC50 for each enzyme. Values were calculated as averages from two independent experiments. Steady State Kinetics of ATP-mediated Repair of the AZT-terminated Primer—The primer-template system used for this study was an AZTMP-terminated 22-mer DNA primer (5′-ATACTTTAACCATATGTATCCTazido-3′) annealed to a 31-mer (5′-TTTTTTTTTTGGATACATATGGTTAAAGTAT-3′) DNA template. The AZTMP-terminated primer was prepared by the addition of a terminal AZTMP to the 21-mer DNA primer (described above). The addition was performed by the addition of wild-type RT (2 μm) to the annealed 21-mer/31-mer DNA primer-template system (1 μm) in RT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100) and 100 μm AZTTP in 6 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at 37 °C. The AZTMP-terminated primer 22-mer/31-mer DNA primer-template duplex was purified using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography on analytical Delta-Pak C18 (100 Å) pre-column using a 2.5-15% acetonitrile gradient in 50 mm triethylammonium acetate buffer, pH 7.0. Fractions corresponding to the expected UV-absorbing material were evaporated, co-evaporated, and lyophilized in water. Their content in 21-, 22-, and 31-mer was evaluated using 32P labeling with nucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The purified AZT-terminated primer 22-/31-mer duplex was 32P-labeled at its 5′ end, as described above, and used to monitor the kinetics of the unblocking reaction in the absence of the next correct nucleotide. The unblocking reaction was started by adding various concentrations of ATP to wild-type or mutants RT (100 nm) bound to 5′-32P-labeled 22-mer DNA/31-mer DNA (50 nm) in RT buffer. Aliquots were withdrawn during the time course of the reaction, and products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (28Meyer P. Schneider B. Sarfati S. Deville-Bonne D. Guerreiro C. Boretto J. Janin J. Veron M. Canard B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3520-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The % rescued of blocked primer is the ratio of product of 21 nucleotides over that of 22 nucleotides, multiplied by 100. The apparent velocity of the unblocking reaction was measured and plotted as a function of ATP concentration. Km (ATP) and k cat(ATP) for the unblocking reaction were determined using curve-fitting with a hyperbola and the Kaleidagraph software. Values were calculated as averages from three independent experiments and standard deviations were <20%. The Y181C substitution in RT is a major resistance determinant of HIV-1 to NNRTIs. When Y181C is introduced into an RT bearing the AZT resistance substitutions D67N/K70R/T215Y/K219Q, AZT resistance is lost, indicating that the presence of Y181C antagonizes the RT-mediated mechanism of AZT resistance. One AZT resistance mechanism is elucidated at the molecular level; the AZTMP-terminated primer is repaired preferentially by AZT-resistant RT relative to wild-type RT (12Meyer P.R. Matsuura S.E. Mian A.M. So A.G. Scott W.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 35-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, a possible effect of the Y181C substitution is the disruption of this enhanced repair capability observed in AZT-resistant RT. However, AZTTP hypersensitivity was documented for several variant RTs, such as A114S and W88G (7Schinazi R.F. Larder B.A. Mellors J.W. Int. Antiviral News. 2000; 8: 65-91Google Scholar), and thus the possibility exists that Y181C actually enhances the incorporation of AZTTP relative to dTTP. Therefore, both AZTTP selectivity and AZTMP-terminated primer unblocking were examined comparatively using RT bearing substitutions relevant to the mechanism of AZT resistance suppression by Y181C. Nucleotide Selectivity of RT Carrying the AZT-resistant/Y181C Substitutions—Nucleotide selectivity is one mechanism of RT-mediated drug resistance (35Deval J. Selmi B. Boretto J. Egloff M.P.

We made use of pre-steady state kinetics to test the possibility that the Y181C substitution would favor the efficiency of incorporation of AZTMP into DNA relative to that of dTTP, resulting in an increased sensitivity to the drug. In this case, such a property should be reflected by changes in either binding constants of nucleotides to RT (K d for AZTTP or dTTP) or catalytic rate constants of incorporation of nucleotides into DNA (k pol for AZTTP or dTTP) (31Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Reardon J.E. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4473-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The kinetic analysis is summarized in Table I. AZTTP binds to wild-type RT (K d = 7.1 μm) with a 2.5-fold greater affinity than dTTP (K d = 17.5 μm). Catalytic rate constants (k pol) for both substrates (dTTP and AZTTP) are comparable (13.2 and 12.8 s-1, respectively). The ratio of nucleotide incorporation efficiencies (1.8/0.75) indicates that wild-type RT actually prefers 2.4-fold AZTTP relative to dTTP.Table IPre-steady state kinetic constants of wild-type, AZT-resistant, and AZT-resistant/Y181C RT for primed heteropolymeric DNA templatesWild-type RTAZT-resistant RTAZT-resistant/Y181C RTdTTPAZTTPdTTPAZTTPdTTPAZTTPKd (μm)aKd and kpol were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” S.D. was <20%17.5bValue from Selmi et al.

AZT-resistant RT also exhibits a higher overall incorporation efficiency (k pol/K d) for AZTTP (0.5 s-1·μm-1) than for dTTP (0.18 s-1·μm-1). Thus, similarly to wild-type RT, AZT-resistant RT does not discriminate AZTTP and still prefers 2.8-fold AZTTP relative to dTTP.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is not only capable of stimulating the proliferation of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells, but also their migration and invasion through an extracellular matrix barrier. Experiments using wortmannin and PD98059, specific inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) and of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK 1 and 2) signaling, respectively, show that the activation of both pathways is required for the PDGF-induced cell motility responses. We have previously shown that somatostatin inhibits cell division and ERK 1/2 and Ras activity in SH-SY5Y cells. We report here that it is also capable of potently and effectively inhibiting their PDGF-stimulated migration and invasion. The inhibitory effect of somatostatin is sensitive to pertussis toxin. Although somatostatin does not affect PI3-K, it inhibits ERK 1/2 and the small G-protein Rac activation and ruffle formation induced by PDGF. These results indicate that somatostatin can be considered an anti-migratory and anti-invasive agent that acts by inhibiting ERK 1/2 signaling and the PI3-K pathway via the inhibition of Rac in SHSY5Y cells.

Neuroblastoma is the most frequent extracranial solid tumor in children. Metastatic disease is found in more than 50% of the patients at the time of diagnosis and is indicative of a poor prognosis. The most frequent metastatic sites are bone, bone marrow, liver, and (more rarely) the central nervous system (1Kramer K. Kushner B. Heller G. Cheung N.-K.V. Cancer. 2001; 91: 1510-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Crucial events for the invasion and spread of tumoral cells are the ability to digest the extracellular matrix, migrate, cross blood vessel walls, and reach the circulation. It is well known that many growth factors can produce some of the characteristic features of invasive growth like proliferation, motility, and increased survival. Among these, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SST, somatostatin; SSTR, somatostatin receptor.1The abbreviations used are: PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-related kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; SST, somatostatin; SSTR, somatostatin receptor. a mitogen mostly for cells of mesenchymal origin, was shown to induce chemotaxis and actin reorganization and prevent cells from dying by apoptosis (2Heldin C.H. Östman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-F113PubMed Google Scholar). As a variety of other neural crest-derived tumor cell lines, neuroblastoma cells express specific transcripts of PDGF genes and both α- and β-PDGF receptor genes (3van Zoelen E.J. van de Ven W.J.M.

Takaishi T. Nakata H. Nakamura H. Chiara K. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is feasible that the simultaneous presence of PDGF and its receptor genes contributes to tumor cell growth and motility by means of an autocrine mechanism. Furthermore, a paracrine mechanism may also be active as the surrounding tissues or cells present in tumors, such as macrophages and endothelial cells, produce PDGF.Somatostatin (SST) is a peptide that is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system and peripheral tissues. Somatostatin has multiple physiological functions, including neuromodulatory actions, inhibition of secretion of growth hormone and of many other hormones produced by the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gastrointestinal tract (5Reichlin S. New Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 6Reichlin S. New Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Moreover, somatostatin has been shown also to possess an anti-proliferative effect in some human cancers including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, and neuroblastoma (7Reubi J.-C. Laissue J.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 110-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Bousquet C. Puente E. Buscail L. Vaysse N. Susini C. Chemiotherapy. 2001; 47: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).The effect of somatostatin are mediated by a family of five different G-protein-coupled receptors, which are variably expressed in both normal tissues and tumors, with many cell lineages expressing two or more subtypes. It has been suggested that somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression is a favorable prognostic factor in human neuroblastoma because high levels of SSTR type 2 positively relate to patient survival (9Albers A.R. O'Dorisio M.S. Balster D.A. Caprara M. Gosh P. Chen F. Hoeger C. Rivier J. Wenger G.D. O'Dorisio T.M. Qualman S.J. Regul. Pept. 2000; 88: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Orlando C.

In previous studies, we have shown that somatostatin inhibits proliferation, ERK 1/2 and Ras activity in SH-SY5Y cells (11Cattaneo M.G. Amoroso D. Gussoni G. Sanguini A.M. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12Cattaneo M.G. Scita G. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and that these cells express all five SSTR subtypes (13Cattaneo M.G. Taylor J.E. Culler M.D. Nisoli E. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has also been reported that somatostatin can inhibit human endothelial-like EAhy926 cell invasion and monocyte migration (14Albini A. Florio T. Giunciuglio D. Masiello L. Carlone S. Corsaro A. Thellung S. Cai T. Noonan D.M. Schettini G. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and these effects have been related to its ability to impair the angiogenic process.On the basis of the above results, we tested the effect of somatostatin on the motility and invasion of PDGF-stimulated SH-SY5Y cells, and found that it potently and efficiently inhibits migration and invasion via a mechanism that depends partly on ERK inhibition and partly on the small G-protein Rac inhibition. We suggest that somatostatin may be useful for controlling invasive growth in neuroblastoma.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—The platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), pertussis toxin, somatostatin, PD98059, and wortmannin were from Sigma. Collagen type IV and Matrigel, a solubilized basement membrane preparation extracted from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma, were from BD Bioscience. The somatostatin analogues were synthesized and supplied by Biomeasure/Beaufour-IPSEN Group, Milford, MA.Antibodies used were: a mouse monoclonal anti-Rac1 (Transduction Laboratories), rabbit polyclonals anti-ERK (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-phospho-ERK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) (New England Biolabs), a mouse monoclonal anti-AKT (Upstate Biotecnology), and a rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473) (BIOSOURCE International).Cell Culture—The human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was routinely grown in RPMI medium (Sigma), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. Before all of the experiments the cells were serum-deprived for 24 h.Cell Migration and Invasion Assays—SH-SY5Y cell migration and invasion were evaluated by means of chemotaxis and chemoinvasion experiments, respectively, in a 48-well modified Boyden chamber. With the migration assay, we assessed the ability of the cells to migrate toward a chemoattractant on a two-dimensional substrate (in our case, collagen type IV). The invasion assay, introducing the use of Matrigel as a three-dimensional matrix, gives information not only about growth factor-induced cell motility, but also about the ability of the cells to cross tissue barriers (for a review, see Ref. 15Friedl P. Wolf K. Nature Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar). This latter in vitro test allows the rapid and quantitative assessment of invasiveness and a mean to screen for drugs that alter the invasive phenotype of tumor cells (16Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the chemotaxis experiments were performed using 8 μm Nuclepore polyvinylpyrrolidine-free polycarbonate filters coated with 10 μg/ml of type IV collagen and placed over a bottom chamber containing 20 ng/ml PDGF as the chemoattractant factor. Serum-free medium was used as a negative control. Suspended in RPMI medium containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, the SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated for 30 min with somatostatin or its analogues and then added to the upper chamber at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well in the presence of the drugs. After six hours of incubation at 37 °C, the non-migrated cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed by scraping. The cells that had migrated to the lower side of the filter were stained with Diff-Quick stain (VWR Scientific Products, Bridgeport, NJ), and 5-8 unit fields per filter were counted at 160× magnification using a Zeiss microscope. The assays were run in triplicate. For the chemoinvasion assays, the filters were coated with a layer of Matrigel (100 μg/filter), and the Boyden chamber was assembled with the coated side of the filter facing the cells in the upper compartment. The assays were then performed as described for chemotaxis.Western Blot Analysis—Quiescent SH-SY5Y cells, treated as indicated, were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and directly lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% bromphenol blue). After SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes that were blocked with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to peroxidase (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), the immunoreactive bands were visualized with chemoluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Rac Activity Assay—The levels of Rac-GTP were measured by affinity precipitation using GST-CRIB (Cdc42 and Rac interactive region of PAK65 (17Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z.S. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar)), as described previously (18Scita G. Nordstrom J. Carbone R. Tenca P. Giardina G. Gutkind S. Bjarnegard M. Betsholtz C. Di Fiore P.P. Nature. 1999; 401: 290-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Briefly, activated Rac-GTP was precipitated from whole cell lysates, prepared in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 500 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, with 20 μl glutation agarose beads coupled with GST-CRIB. After 12.5% SDS-PAGE, active Rac protein was detected by Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-Rac antibody. The densitometric analysis of the immunoblots was performed using the National Institute of Health (NIH) Image program.Immunofluorescence—Quiescent SH-SY5Y cells, plated on glass coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml collagen IV and treated as indicated, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) was used to detect filamentous actin. The confocal images were obtained using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope.RESULTSPDGF-stimulated Motility and Invasiveness in SH-SY5Y Cells—We have previously reported (13Cattaneo M.G. Taylor J.E. Culler M.D. Nisoli E. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) the proliferative effect of PDGF on the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line. In this study, we investigated its ability to stimulate motility and invasion in SH-SY5Y cells by using chemotaxis and chemoinvasion experiments. The chemotaxis assays show the ability of the cells to migrate toward a chemoattractant (PDGF) on a two-dimensional substrate. The chemoinvasion assays show the additional ability to cross a tissue barrier represented by the Matrigel (for more details, see “Experimental Procedures”). As shown in Fig. 1, PDGF stimulated migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 of about 5 ng/ml for both phenomena. The peak stimulatory effect was reached at a concentration of 20 ng/ml, corresponding to an increase from baseline of 9.27 ± 1.09 times in chemotaxis (16.4 ± 0.6 cells/field) and 9.57 ± 0.35 times in chemoinvasion (10.9 ± 2.6 cells/field).Depending on the cell type, various signaling pathways have been shown to be involved in PDGF-induced cell motility (19Rönnstrand L. Heldin C.-H. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 91: 757-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The PI3-Ks are a family of lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-OH group of the inositol ring of membrane-bound phosphoinositides. The main phospholipid formed (phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)) and the protein kinase that is activated by it (AKT) trigger a cascade of responses from cell growth and proliferation to survival and motility (20Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4587) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the MAPK pathways are also crucial signal transducing systems that are involved in the regulation of important cellular processes like cell proliferation, cell survival, and also, in some cases, cell motility (21Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4328) Google Scholar). These physiological events are mainly regulated by the ERK 1/2, which are the most widely expressed enzymes belonging to the MAPK family.To elucidate the pathways responsible for the pro-migratory effect of PDGF on SH-SY5Y cells, the cells were pretreated for 30 min with 100 nm wortmannin to block the PI3-K pathway or 10 μm PD98059 to block the ERK 1/2 pathway. The results shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that both drugs reduced PDGF-stimulated migration, with an inhibition of 63 ± 8.8% and 57 ± 11% (n = 6), respectively. A similar inhibitory effect of PD98059 and wortmannin on PDGF-induced invasion was also observed (Fig. 2), thus suggesting that both pathways are required for the PDGF stimulation of migration and invasion in SH-SY5Y cells.Fig. 2Effect of PD98059 and wortmannin on PDGF-induced migration and invasion in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated for 30 min with PD98059 (10 μm, horizontal bar) or wortmannin (100 nm, diagonal bar) before stimulation with PDGF (20 ng/ml).

Lamberts S.W. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 2002; 14: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and their activation is responsible for the direct anti-proliferative effect of the peptide (8Bousquet C. Puente E. Buscail L. Vaysse N. Susini C. Chemiotherapy. 2001; 47: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To verify whether somatostatin possesses anti-migratory and anti-invasive properties, we studied its effects on PDGF-induced motility and invasion in SH-SY5Y cells, previously characterized in our laboratory for the expression of multiple SSTR subtypes (13Cattaneo M.G. Taylor J.E. Culler M.D. Nisoli E. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of the cells with somatostatin inhibited the migration and invasion induced by PDGF 20 ng/ml in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Peak inhibition of both phenomena (about 50%) was reached at a somatostatin concentration of 1 μm. The estimated IC50s for migration and invasion were ∼10 and 1 nm, respectively. Somatostatin did not inhibit cell motility and invasiveness in the absence of motogenic stimuli, i.e. in the absence of PDGF (data not shown).Fig. 3Somatostatin inhibited PDGF-induced migration and invasion in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were treated for 30 min with the indicated concentration of SST. Chemotaxis and chemoinvasion experiments were then performed as described, using PDGF (20 ng/ml) as attractant. The results are expressed as the maximal percentage migration (•) or invasion (▪) induced by the growth factor, and are the mean values ± S.E. of 6 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Somatostatin Analogues on PDGF-induced Migration and Invasion—SH-SY5Y cells express all five SSTR subtypes (13Cattaneo M.G. Taylor J.E. Culler M.D. Nisoli E. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In an attempt to define the receptor subtype(s) responsible for the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of somatostatin in SH-SY5Y cells, we tested a series of somatostatin analogues that are selective for the subtypes 1 (Bim 23745), 2 (Bim 23120), and 5 (Bim 23206). The binding affinities of the analogues were previously established by receptor binding assays, using membrane preparations obtained from transfected CHO-K1 cells expressing the human SSTR subtypes 1-5, as described by Shimon et al. (23Shimon I. Taylor Y.E. Dong J.Z. Bitonte R.A. Kim S. Morgan B. Coy D.H. Culler M.D. Melmed S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The IC50 values for the compounds used in our experiments were described in a previous report (13Cattaneo M.G. Taylor J.E. Culler M.D. Nisoli E. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), where it is shown that each analogue binds to the specific receptor subtype with an affinity 50-100× higher than to the other ones. As shown in Fig. 4A, all three analogues (at concentrations of 200 nm for Bim 23745, and 20 nm for Bim 23120 and Bim 23206), inhibited the migration induced by 20 ng/ml PDGF. Thus, the stimulation of the individual SSTR subtypes 1, 2, and 5 had the same inhibitory effect as somatostatin. Similar results were obtained using 10 nm of Bim 23244 (Fig. 4A), an analogue that selectively binds to subtypes 2 and 5 with low nanomolar affinity (IC50s of 0.29 and 0.67 nm, respectively, and >200 nm for the other receptor subtypes). The inhibitory effect ranged from 25 ± 6% (n = 4) for Bim 23120 to 44.5 ± 11.6% (n = 4) for Bim 23244, but variance analysis failed to reveal statistically significant differences between the various treatments. All of the above analogues also repressed the invasive process induced by PDGF (Fig. 4B) with very similar percentages of inhibition (about 40%).Fig. 4Effect of somatostatin analogues on PDGF-induced migration (A) and invasion (B) in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated for 30 min with Bim 23745 (200 nm, horizontal bar), Bim 23120 (20 nm, diagonal bar), Bim 23206 (20 nm, cross-hatched bar), and Bim 23244 (10 nm, vertical bar), and the experiments were then performed as described, using PDGF (20 ng/ml) as attractant.

Dournaud P. Neuropeptides. 2001; 35: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To elucidate the pertussis toxin-dependence of the anti-migratory and anti-invasive effects of somatostatin, SH-SY5Y cells were treated for four hours with pertussis toxin 150 ng/ml, and chemotaxis and chemoinvasion experiments were performed in the presence of somatostatin 1 μm and PDGF 20 ng/ml. As shown in Fig. 5, pertussis toxin treatment did not significantly modify the chemotactic properties of PDGF, which induced an increase from baseline of 8.95 ± 0.92 times in the absence of pertussis toxin and 7.3 ± 1.83 times in the presence of pertussis toxin (n = 3). The inhibitory effect of somatostatin on SH-SY5Y cell migration was totally reverted by pertussis toxin treatment (Fig. 5). Likewise, pertussis toxin treatment also abolished the somatostatin-induced reduction in SH-SY5Y cell invasiveness (data not shown).Fig. 5The inhibitory effect of somatostatin on PDGF-induced migration was reverted by pertussis toxin treatment. SH-SY5Y cell migration was evaluated as described under “Experimental Procedures,” in the absence (open bar) or in the presence (diagonal bar) of somatostatin (SST, 1 μm). PDGF (20 ng/ml) was used as attractant. Where indicated, the cells were treated for 4 h with pertussis toxin (PTX, 150 ng/ml) before the experiments. The results are expressed as fold increase in the number of migrated cells under basal conditions (i.e. in the absence of PDGF), and are the mean values ± S.E. of 3 independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Somatostatin on PDGF-induced ERK and PI3-K Activation in SH-SY5Y Cells—As mentioned above, the activation of both ERK and PI3-K pathways is required for the migratory and invasive effects of PDGF on SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 2). We therefore evaluated the possibility that the inhibitory effect of somatostatin might be mediated by its ability to interfere with the PDGF-induced activation of these intracellular pathways. We have previously shown (11Cattaneo M.G. Amoroso D. Gussoni G. Sanguini A.M. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 13Cattaneo M.G. Taylor J.E. Culler M.D. Nisoli E. Vicentini L.M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 481: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) that somatostatin inhibits PDGF-induced ERK 1/2 activation in SH-SY5Y cells (also see Fig. 6B,lane 5). Thus, this finding indicates that somatostatin acts on at least one of the mechanisms required for PDGF-induced motility and invasion. AKT is a protein kinase recruited to the membrane and activated by phosphorylation as a direct consequence of PI3-K activity (20Cantley L.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1655-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (4587) Google Scholar). In this study, we evaluated AKT phosphorylation levels to test whether somatostatin is also capable of inhibiting PDGF-induced PI3-K activation. As shown in Fig. 6A, somatostatin 1 μm did not modify the phosphorylation levels of AKT (lane 5) in comparison with PDGF 20 ng/ml alone (lane 2). Similar results were obtained in an in vitro assay of the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated AKT (data not shown). The phosphorylation of AKT induced by PDGF was totally blunted by the specific PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm) (Fig. 6A,lane 4), whereas ERK 1/2 activation was unaffected by the same treatment (Fig. 6B, lane 4). Moreover, the specific ERK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm) greatly decreased ERK 1/2 (Fig. 6B, lane 3), but not the AKT phosphorylation (Fig. 6A, lane 3) induced by PDGF, thus suggesting that the two pathways (ERK and PI3-K) in SH-SY5Y cells are activated by the growth factor in an independent manner.Fig. 6Effect of PD98059 and wortmannin on ERK 1/2 and AKT phosphorylation induced by PDGF in SH-SY5Y cells.

The activation state of Rac and Rho was assessed by means of pull down assays using recombinant proteins that recognize the GTP-bound form of the two proteins as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The treatment of quiescent SH-SY5Y cells with PDGF 20 ng/ml stimulated Rac activity (Fig. 7A, lane 2), with an increase of 1.82 ± 0.13 times over baseline (n = 6), as revealed by densitometric analysis (Fig. 7B). Pretreatment with somatostatin 1 μm for 10 min suppressed PDGF-induced Rac activation (Fig. 7A, lane 3), with a percentage inhibition of 79.2 ± 12.5% (n = 5). We were not able to detect increased Rho activity above basal levels in response to PDGF treatment (n = 10, results not shown). When characterizing the molecular mechanisms involved in PDGF-induced Rac activation in SH-SY5Y cells, we found that the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin (100 nm) totally inhibited the Rac activation (Fig. 7A, lane 4), whereas the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm) did not affect Rac stimulation induced by PDGF (Fig. 7A, lane 5).Fig. 7Somatostatin inhibited PDGF-induced Rac activation in SH-SY5Y cells.

They can thereby inhibit the decay of labile transcripts by antagonizing destabilizing proteins that target these AU-rich sequences. Here we examine the sequence preferences of HuD to elucidate its possible role in counteracting mRNA decay. Using repeats of the prototype destabilizing sequence UU(AUUU)nAUU, we show that all three HuD RNA-binding domains participate in binding to AU-tracts that can be as short as 13 residues, depending on the position of the remaining As. Removal of the A residues, resulting in a poly(U)-tract, increased the affinity of HuD for RNA, suggesting that the presence of As in destabilizing elements might favor the recruitment of other proteins and/or prevent HuD from binding too tightly to AREs. In vitro selection experiments with randomized RNAs confirmed the preference of HuD for poly(U). RNA binding analysis of the related protein HuB showed a similar preference for poly(U). In contrast, tristetraprolin, an mRNA destabilizing protein, strongly prefers AU-rich RNA. Many labile mRNAs contain U-tracts in or near their AREs. Individual AREs may thus differentially affect mRNA half-life by recruiting a unique complement of stabilizing and destabilizing factors.

Mutagenesis experiments using chimeric RNAs identified the nonamer UUAUUUA(U/A)(U/A) as a prototype minimal destabilizing element (9Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

Further functional and sequence characterization of AREs from many different mRNAs has resulted in their classification into groups based on the number and position of (AUUUA) repeats and/or U-rich sequences (3Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 6Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Although all known mRNA destabilizing AREs appear to function by a similar mechanism, stimulating poly(A) tail loss followed by degradation of the mRNA body, the sequence heterogeneity of AREs may explain differences in the kinetics of deadenylation and mRNA half-life between individual genes (3Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar, 6Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). The potential for large scale gene regulation through ARE sequences is illustrated by the recent establishment of a human ARE-mRNA data base (ARED) (11Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This data base shows that 8% of human mRNAs contain AREs, indicating that over 2,000 genes could potentially be regulated at the level of mRNA stability. It should be noted, however, that AREs are not only involved in mRNA decay, but may also affect translation, mRNA localization, and polyadenylation (reviewed in Refs. 12Zhang T. Kruys V. Huez G. Gueydan C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 20: 952-958Crossref Google Scholar, 13Conne B. Stutz A. Vassalli J.D. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 14Richter J. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 446-456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AREs carry out their function through the binding of trans-acting factors. Numerous ARE-binding proteins have been characterized, including AUBF, AUF-1 (hnRNP D), hnRNPA1, hnRNPC, AUH, tristetraprolin (TTP), TIAR and TIA-1, KSRP, Hu proteins, and others (reviewed in Ref. 1Bevilacqua A. Ceriani M.C. Capaccioli S. Nicolin A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 195: 356-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although the function of some ARE-binding proteins remains unknown, a subset of them (AUF-1, TTP, KSRP, and BRF1) has been implicated in accelerating mRNA decay (15Laroia G. Cuesta R. Brewer G.

Others, such as members of the Hu protein family, appear to stabilize ARE-containing mRNAs, presumably by competing with the destabilizing factors (1Bevilacqua A. Ceriani M.C. Capaccioli S.

There are four known Hu family members: the ubiquitous HuR(HuA) and neuronal-specific HuB (Hel-N1), HuC, and HuD. All four proteins contain three RNA recognition motif-type RNA-binding domains (RRMs), ∼90-amino acid domains found in hundreds of RNA-binding proteins of diverse function (25Nagai K. Oubridge C.

Hu proteins have also been implicated in cancer, as they are overexpressed in neuroblastoma and small cell lung cancer, two types of cancer that show stabilization of labile proto-oncogene mRNAs such as those of the MYC, MYCN, and FOS genes (35Chagnovich D.

Biol. 2000; 23: 560-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). One of the most compelling studies supporting the idea that Hu proteins slow mRNA decay through competition with destabilizing ARE-binding proteins is an analysis of the dynamic regulation of interleukin-3 mRNA, which is stabilized by HuR and destabilized by TTP (48Ming X.-F. Stoeklin G. Lu M. Looser R. Moroni C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5778-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The interleukin-3 study illustrates that the identity of the proteins bound to an ARE plays an important role in determining the fate of the mRNA. Which proteins are bound to a given ARE is determined by many factors: the intracellular location and concentration of the various proteins, their RNA-binding kinetics, their sequence preference, the minimal sequence required for their recruitment to the RNA, their potential to bind cooperatively, and their interactions with other proteins. Despite the importance of these characteristics, our knowledge about the mechanism by which ARE-binding proteins interact with their RNA targets remains very limited. Although studies of the interaction between these proteins and their natural RNA targets are important, a detailed mechanistic understanding of RNA binding by Hu proteins is difficult to obtain with the long and usually heterogeneous naturally occurring AU-rich elements. Use of these heterogeneous sequences complicates experimental interpretation, such as the determination of the identity of individual binding sites and the exact number of proteins bound (and therefore the affinity of the interaction). For this reason, we use a model system of short synthetic AU-rich sequences based on the prototype mRNA destabilizing element UUAUUUAUU (9Zubiaga A.M. Belasco J.G. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2219-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 10Lagnado C.A. Brown C.Y. Goodall G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7984-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Our aims are to gain detailed mechanistic insight into RNA binding by Hu proteins: to better define the size and the sequence of the RNA-binding target and the affinity and kinetic parameters for this interaction. Of the four highly conserved family members, we have chosen HuD as a model system because its interaction with RNA has been best characterized biochemically, kinetically, and structurally (28Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 49Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A.

We use HuD RRM domain deletion mutants and the individual RRMs to explore the role of the different domains in binding and in determining target specificity, and in vitro genetics to further probe sequence preferences. Finally, we compare the sequence preferences of HuD with those of the related protein HuB and the destabilizing protein TTP. Plasmid Construction and Protein Purification—The full-length HuD protein bacterial expression construct (pET3d-HuD, F578) was described previously (49Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It encodes the most common isoform, HuD, lacking the second alternate exon in the hinge domain (amino acid residues 252 to 265) (30Liu J. Dalmau J. Szabo A. Rosenfeld M. Huber J. Furneaux H. Neurology. 1995; 45: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and carries C-terminal hexahistidine and MYC epitope tags. The HuB expression plasmid (pET3d-Hel-N1, F622) contains the same epitope tags as F578 and was derived by PCR from plasmid pCMVHel-N1 (kindly provided by Drs. Geoffrey Manley and Henry Furneaux). HuD deletion mutants were derived from F578 as described (49Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding biotinylatable HuD was made by inserting a 19-amino acid tag (MSGLNDIFEAQKIEWHGAP) directly upstream of the HuD ATG in F578. A plasmid encoding a 73-amino acid MYC and hexahistidine-tagged fragment of murine TTP containing its zinc fingers was generated by PCR from a TTP expression plasmid (mTTP.tag) kindly provided by Dr. Christoph Moroni (51Stoecklin G. Ming X.-F. Looser R. Moroni C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3753-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), using the primers 5′-CTCTCACCATGGGTTCTCGATACAAGACCGAGC-3′ and 5′-TGGGGCGCGGCCGCGAGAGCTAGGTCCTCGG-3′. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified using Ni2+ beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in sonication buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm imidazole) containing 10% glycerol and increasing concentrations of imidazole (50 to 250 mm) as described previously (49Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Proteins were aliquotted and stored at –80 °C, and thawing and freezing were minimized. Biotinylated HuD was generated by co-transforming the biotinylatable HuD construct with a plasmid encoding biotin ligase (Avidity, Denver, CO) and including 50 mm biotin in the bacterial culture during induction. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), followed by comparisons of an extensive dilution series to a known standard on Coomassie Blue-stained gels. Biotinylation of HuD was tested by Western blot analysis using Extravidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma-Aldrich). Preparation of RNA Transcripts—The templates for RNA targets (see Figs. 1, 3, and 5) were generated by annealing the appropriate complementary DNA oligomers (generated by the University of Southern California Microchemical Core Facility) and ligating them into an SphI-cleaved pGEM-derived vector (pEP40) (52Laird-Offringa I.A. Belasco J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11859-11863Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Plasmids were linearized with AccI (which cuts just downstream of the RNA targets) and used for in vitro transcription as described (49Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol.

Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding reactions were carried out in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 1–2 fmol of [α-33P]-labeled in vitro transcribed RNA, to which were added 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg/ml tRNA. 10 μl binding reactions were equilibrated at room temperature for 1 h before loading on 8% polyacrylamide Tris/glycine gels at 4 °C as described (49Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Gel shift bands were analyzed using a Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager, and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). KD values were calculated by plotting the logarithm of ratio of complex/free RNA against the logarithm of the protein concentration, which yields log(KD) as the x intercept. Lines were obtained by linear regression. Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore) Analysis—The dynamics of RNA-protein interactions were studied using a Biacore 2000 (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). 5′-Biotinylated RNAs were diluted to 1 μm in HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20), heated at 80 °C for 10 min, cooled to room temperature, diluted to 20 fmol/μl in running buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 62.5 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 125 μg/ml tRNA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% surfactant P20 (Biacore, Inc.)), and injected at 10 μl/min. 50–100 response units of RNA were coated per flow channel on each streptavidin-coated sensor chip (SA chip; Biacore Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Triplicate 2-min injections of four different protein concentrations (11, 5.5, 2.75, and 1.4 nm) were injected in random order over the sensor chip surface at 25 °C and a flow rate of 50 μl/min. The surface was regenerated by removing bound proteins with a 60-s 2 m NaCl injection followed by a 60-s binding buffer injection to rinse the needle. Sensorgrams were fit to a simple 1:1 Langmuir interaction model using the nonlinear data analysis program CLAMP with a correction for mass transport (53Myszka D.G. Morton T.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 149-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In Vitro RNA Selection—In vitro selection was performed according to Kenan et al. (54Kenan D.J. Keene J.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 118: 217-231PubMed Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide library with a complexity of 413 (7 × 107), containing a randomized 13-nucleotide region (N)13 flanked by constant sequences (5′-TGGACGCGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGGG-(N)13GGCATGCAAGCTTCGTGCACCC-3′), a forward primer that contains a T7 promoter and anneals upstream of N13 (5′-AAAAATAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTGCACGAAGCTTGCATGCC-3′), and a reverse primer that can anneal downstream of (N)13 templates (5′-TGGACGCGTCGACCTGCAGGCATGGG-3′), were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). Library oligonucleotides were converted into double-stranded DNA by annealing the forward primer, followed by primer extension using Klenow polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Following PCR amplification using the forward and reverse constant primers, a fraction of the DNA pool representing the full library was in vitro transcribed using the MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). 20 pmol of randomized RNAs and 20 pmol of biotinylated HuD were equilibrated for 30 min at room temperature in 100 μl of gel shift binding buffer. The binding reactions were then incubated with streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads (Streptavidin Magnasphere; Promega, Madison, WI) for 30 min with gentle tumbling. 300 μl of streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads were used per binding reaction. Beads were washed twice with 0.1 m NaOH, 0.1 m NaCl and twice with 0.1 m NaCl prior to the binding experiment. Bound RNA was purified by two phenol/chloroform extractions followed by ethanol precipitation and was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR using Superscript II, RNase H– reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the constant forward and reverse primers, followed by in vitro transcription to generate RNAs for the next round of selection. A fraction of the cDNAs from each round was digested with HindIII and PstI and cloned into the corresponding sites in vector pEP40. Clones from round 0, 3, 4, and 5 were sequenced. Full-length HuD Binds to a 13-Nucleotide ARE—Our previous studies of HuD interacting with a variety of AU-rich RNA targets of the type UU(AUUU)nUU (embedded in non AU-rich RNA) had indicated that the protein bound well to the 17-nt tract UU(AUUU)3AUU (AU3) but much more poorly to the 13-nt sequence UU(AUUU)2AUU (AU2) (49Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Gel shift analysis of AU3/HuD complexes had also indicated that more than one molecule of HuD protein (visible as an additional shifted band) can bind to AU3 at high protein concentrations (49Park S. Myszka D.G. Yu M. Littler S.J. Laird-Offringa I.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4765-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggested that the minimal AU-rich tract required for binding of full-length HuD contains three AUUU repeats and is more than 13 but less than 17 nucleotides long. More precise mapping of the HuD RNA target length would be useful to understand RNA occupancy by HuD, which would aid in developing a model of RNA binding by the full-length protein, and in devising RNA targets for structural studies (NMR, crystallography) of the complete complex. In addition, knowledge of the minimal binding sequence is required for the design of experiments to measure possible cooperativity of HuD binding to RNA. Cooperativity would strongly influence the ability of HuD to occupy the extended and heterogeneous AU-rich sequences naturally occurring in many labile mRNAs and thus would affect the ability of HuD to compete with other AU-binding proteins. Therefore, we shortened the AU-tract of AU3 by one or two nucleotides at a time from each end and analyzed the ability of HuD to bind to the resulting targets by gel shift analysis (Fig. 1). Removal of the two flanking Us (AU3ΔFLU) resulted in a very modest loss of affinity. Further shortening of the AU-tract by removal of one or both of the subsequent flanking Us and the following 5′A (constructs 13AU3+5′U, 13AU3+3′U, 13AU3, and 13AU3Δ5′A; see Fig. 1) yielded RNA targets with moderately weakened affinities that were all in the same range (KD ∼200 nm). However, removal of the 3′A (13AU3Δ3′A) caused a further loss in affinity and removal of both As (11AU3) produced an RNA target that was bound much more weakly (Fig. 1). Thus, AU-rich tracts as short as 12–13 nucleotides bound relatively tightly, but further shortening to 11 nucleotides resulted in a substantial weakening of the interaction. We cautiously interpreted this to mean that the minimal binding sequence is 12–13 nucleotides long and chose the symmetrical sequence 13AU3 as a representative of the minimal target. If such a"

In the crystallographic ADH8-NADP+ complex, a binding pocket for the extra phosphate group of coenzyme is formed by ADH8-specific residues Gly223-Thr224-His225, and the highly conserved Leu200 and Lys228. To investigate the minimal structural determinants for coenzyme specificity, several ADH8 mutants involving residues 223 to 225 were engineered and kinetically characterized. Computer-assisted modeling of the docked coenzymes was also performed with the mutant enzymes and compared with the wild-type crystallographic binary complex. The G223D mutant, having a negative charge in the phosphate-binding site, still preferred NADP(H) over NAD(H), as did the T224I and H225N mutants. Catalytic efficiency with NADP(H) dropped dramatically in the double mutants, G223D/T224I and T224I/H225N, and in the triple mutant, G223D/T224I/H225N (k cat/K mNADPH = 760 mm-1 min-1), as compared with the wild-type enzyme (k cat/K mNADPH = 133,330 mm-1 min-1). This was associated with a lower binding affinity for NADP+ and a change in the rate-limiting step. Conversely, in the triple mutant, catalytic efficiency with NAD(H) increased, reaching values (k cat/K mNADH = 155,000 mm-1 min-1) similar to those of the wild-type enzyme with NADP(H). The complete reversal of ADH8 coenzyme specificity was therefore attained by the substitution of only three consecutive residues in the phosphate-binding site, an unprecedented achievement within the ADH family.

The complete reversal of ADH8 coenzyme specificity was therefore attained by the substitution of only three consecutive residues in the phosphate-binding site, an unprecedented achievement within the ADH family. Coenzyme specificity is an important property of NAD(P)-dependent oxidoreductases that is linked to their metabolic function. Thus the type of coenzyme, NAD+ or NADP+, often distinguishes between enzymes involved in alternative pathways (e.g. oxidative versus reductive or degradative versus biosynthetic). Because NAD+ and NADP+ only differ structurally in the phosphate group esterified at the 2′ position of adenosine ribose, dehydrogenases must possess a limited number of residues to discriminate between the two coenzyme types. Moreover, among dehydrogenases from a given enzyme family, the same protein fold is often used to bind either coenzyme type and even some enzymes show dual activity, meaning that they can use both coenzymes with similar efficiency (1Backer P.J. Britton K.L. Rice D.W. Rob A. Stillman T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A rather unique NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH8) 1The abbreviations used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; K ia, dissociation constant for coenzyme; K a, K m for coenzyme; K b, K m for ethanol; MDR, medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase.1The abbreviations used are: ADH, alcohol dehydrogenase; K ia, dissociation constant for coenzyme; K a, K m for coenzyme; K b, K m for ethanol; MDR, medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase. was discovered in the gastric tissues of amphibians (2Peralba J.M. Cederlund E. Crosas B. Moreno A. Julià P. Martínez S.E. Persson B. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26021-26026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). ADH8 belongs to the medium chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) superfamily and is phylogenetically related to the NAD-dependent vertebrate ADH family. This enzyme is active with ethanol and functionally may participate in the reduction of retinal to retinol (k cat/K m all-trans-retinal = 33,750 mm-1 min-1). Recently, the three-dimensional structure of the ADH8-NADP+ binary complex was determined at 1.8-Å resolution (3Rosell A. Valencia E. Parés X. Fita I. Farrés J. Ochoa W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Structural data suggested that the preference for NADP(H) depends on the segment Gly223-Thr224-His225 (Asp223-Ile/Leu224-Asn225 in most vertebrate NAD-dependent ADHs; Ref. 4Sun H.W. Plapp B.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which together with Leu200 and Lys228, define a binding pocket for the terminal phosphate group of NADP(H). Henceforth residue numbering will correspond to that of horse ADH1 with the Swiss Prot entry P00327. Interestingly, NADP-dependent ADHs from distantly related microorganisms (5Burdette D.S. Vieille C. Zeikus J.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Korkhin Y. Kalb A.J. Peretz M. Bogin O. Burstein Y. Frolow F. J. Mol.

A. 1992; 89: 10188-10192Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), also have a glycine and two more hydrophilic residues at the positions corresponding to 223, 224, and 225, respectively. In ADHs, residue 223 is located at the C-terminal end of the second β-strand of the Rossmann fold (8Rossmann M.G. Moras D. Olsen K.W. Nature. 1974; 250: 194-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) and classically is considered as determinant for coenzyme specificity. The substitution D223G, as found in ADH8, would avoid the possible steric and electrostatic hindrances because of the extra phosphate group of NADP(H). In fact, different attempts to switch the coenzyme specificity in medium chain ADHs have been focused on mutations involving residue 223 (9Fan F. Lorenzen J.A. Plapp B.V. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6397-6401Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 10Lauvergeat V. Kennedy K. Feuillet C. McKie J.H. Gorrichon L. Baltas M. Boudet A.M. Grima-Pettenati J. Douglas K.T.

Plapp B.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 367: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, full reversal of coenzyme specificity, in terms of having a mutant enzyme as catalytically efficient as the wild type, has been rarely achieved. This implies that conversion of coenzyme specificity may require multiple substitutions in the coenzyme-binding domain. Other residues found in ADH8, such as Thr224 and His225, which are making hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms from the terminal phosphate group (3Rosell A. Valencia E. Parés X. Fita I. Farrés J. Ochoa W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), could also be important in defining coenzyme specificity of ADH8. In the present work, we have investigated, by means of site-directed mutagenesis, steady-state kinetics, and computer modeling, the individual and combined contribution of the adjacent residues Gly223-Thr224-His225 of ADH8 to coenzyme specificity. Moreover, because the ADH8 sequence is only 30% deviant from the closest NAD-dependent ADH structure (Rana perezi ADH1, Ref. 13Cederlund E. Peralba J.M. Parés X. Jörnvall H. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2811-2816Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it was a suitable candidate for attempting the redesign of coenzyme specificity. Site-directed Mutagenesis—G223D, T224I, H225N, G223D/T224I, and T224I/H225N mutants were obtained using the wild-type ADH8 cDNA cloned into pGEX 4T-2 as a template. The mutations were introduced by sequential steps of PCR. In a first round, two reactions, 1 and 2, were performed with the following primers: 1) RanaL primer, 5′-TTATAGGATCCATGTGCACTGCGGGAAAAGAT-3′, and one of the antisense primers containing the mutations (underlined): 223R, 5′-GTCTTTATGGGTATCAACCCCTATAATACG-3′; 224R, 5′-GTCTTTATGGATTCCAACCCCTATAATAC-3′; 225R, 5′-GTCTTTATTGGTTCCAACCCCTATAATACG-3′; 224/225R, 5′-GTCTTTATTGATTCCAACCCCTATAATAC-3′; 2) RanaR primer, 5′-CCACCTGAATTCTTAGTATATCATAATGCTTCG-3′ and one of the primers containing the sense mutations. In a final amplification step, purified overlapping PCR products were used as templates, using RanaL and RanaR primers. All reactions were performed in a DNA thermal cycler (MJ Research) with High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Diagnostics) under the following conditions: hot start at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, extension at 68 °C for 12 min (11 cycles to step 2), and a final extension step. All PCR products were purified and cloned into pGEX 4T-2 as for wild-type cDNA (14Valencia E. Rosell A. Larroy C. Farrés J. Biosca J.A. Fita I. Parés X. Ochoa W.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The G223D/T224I and G223D/T224I/H225N mutants were obtained using a method based on the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Full-length pGEX 4T-2, containing G223D and T224I/H225N cDNAs, were used as templates to obtain the double and triple mutants, respectively. Mutagenesis was performed by means of a single PCR using an antisense primer containing the mutation (2G23/224R, 5′-GTCTTTATGGATATCAACCCCTATAATAC-3′ or TMR, 5′-GTCTTTATTGATATCAACCCCTATAATACG-3′) and primers containing either sense mutation. PCR conditions were the same as above except for the use of Expand Long Template polymerase (Roche). PCR products were incubated with DpnI at 37 °C for 60 min. This treatment ensured the digestion of the dam-methylated parental strand (15Nelson M. McClelland M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 279-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The resulting nicked circular mutagenic strands were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21, where bacterial DNA ligase repaired the nick and allowed normal replication to occur. Prior to expression, all mutated DNAs were completely sequenced, to ensure that unwanted mutations were absent. Protein Expression and Purification—All mutants were expressed using the conditions previously described for the wild-type enzyme (14Valencia E. Rosell A. Larroy C. Farrés J. Biosca J.A. Fita I. Parés X. Ochoa W.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Batch-wise purification of wild-type and T224I enzymes followed identical procedures (14Valencia E. Rosell A. Larroy C. Farrés J. Biosca J.A. Fita I. Parés X. Ochoa W.F. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For G223D, H225N, G223D/T224I, T224I/H225N, and G223D/T224I/H225N mutants, the only difference was the matrix used in the last affinity chromatography step (Cibacron Blue 3-GA; Sigma). The degree of purity for each protein was assessed by means of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad assay, based on the method of Bradford (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity Assays—Alcohol dehydrogenase activity was determined at 25 °C by monitoring the change in absorbance at 340 nm, using a Cary 400 Bio (Varian) spectrophotometer. One unit of activity corresponds to 1 μmol of reduced coenzyme formed or utilized per min, based on an absorption coefficient of 6220 m-1 cm-1 at 340 nm for NADH or NADPH. Cuvette path length was 1 cm in oxidation reactions and 0.2 cm in reduction reactions. Alcohol oxidation was performed in 0.1 m glycine/NaOH, pH 10.0, or in 0.1 m sodium phosphate/NaOH, pH 7.5, using 1 m ethanol or 1.5 mm octanol as a substrate, respectively. For aldehyde reduction, 0.1 m sodium phosphate/NaOH, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mm m-nitrobenzaldehyde were used. When saturation could be reached, kinetic parameters were obtained from activity measurements with substrate or coenzyme concentrations that ranged from 0.1 × K m to 10 × K m. Each individual rate measurement was run in duplicate. Three determinations were performed for each kinetic constant. Kinetic constants were obtained with the non-linear regression program Grafit 5.0 (Erithacus Software Ltd.) and expressed as the mean ± S.D. Bisubstrate kinetic constants were calculated by fitting data to a Bi-Bi sequential mechanism (17Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). The standard assays were performed using 1 m ethanol as a substrate in 0.1 m glycine/NaOH, pH 10.0, and 1.2 mm NADP+ for wild-type and G223D mutants; 2.4 mm NADP+ for T224I and H225N mutants; 0.4 mm NAD+ for G223D/T224I/H225N; and 2.4 mm NAD+ for G223D/T224I and T224I/H225N mutants. Deuterium Kinetic Isotope Effect—Kinetic constants for NAD+ and NADP+ were determined in 0.1 m Gly/NaOH, pH 10.0, with 1 m ethanol-d 6 (Merck) or ethanol as a substrate at different coenzyme concentrations, depending on the enzyme assayed. For the G223D/T224I and G223D/T224I/H225N mutants, saturation with NADP+ could not be achieved, and thus a single concentration of 4.8 mm NADP+ was used to measure enzyme activity. Assay buffer and ethanol-d 6 solution were prepared in deuterated water. Structural Modeling of the Variants—The structures of all the variants were modeled using the available coordinates of the binary complex ADH8-NADP+ (Protein Data Bank entry 1P0F, Ref. 3Rosell A. Valencia E. Parés X. Fita I. Farrés J. Ochoa W.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), where the corresponding substituted residues were introduced with the graphics program O (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Conformations of the replaced residues were initially assumed to be the rotamers that presented less steric constraints. The geometry of the models was then regularized and refined throughout cycles of energy minimization with the program XPLOR (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). Our study focused on residues 223 to 225 of ADH8, with the aim of testing their role in the phosphate-binding site and attempting the switch of coenzyme specificity. The obvious choice was to mutate Gly223, Thr224, and His225 to Asp, Ile, and Asn, respectively, because the sequence Asp223-Ile/Leu224-Asn225 is well conserved among vertebrate NAD-dependent ADHs (4Sun H.W. Plapp B.V. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 34: 522-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, single ADH8 mutants, G223D, T224I, and H225N, double mutants, G223D/T224I and T224I/H225N, and the triple mutant, G223D/T224I/H225N, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. The expression level for the wild-type enzyme and mutants was ∼30 mg/liter of culture.

Cederlund E. Crosas B. Moreno A. Julià P. Martínez S.E. Persson B. Farrés J. Parés X. Jörnvall H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26021-26026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). At a given pH and with the same substrate, the k cat values attained with NADP(H) and NAD(H) were similar, suggesting a common rate-limiting step, independent of the cofactor used. By contrast, K m values for NADP(H) were 10-40-fold lower than those for NAD(H). This resulted in an enzyme much more specific for NADP(H), especially at pH 7.5. Regarding the effect of substitutions on coenzyme kinetics, most of the observations made at pH 10.0 (Table I) could be confirmed at pH 7.5, for both the oxidation (Table II) and the reduction (Table III) reactions. This suggests that the introduced mutations had a similar effect on each coenzyme kinetics, independently of pH and whether the cofactor used was in its oxidized or reduced form. However, the substitutions did have a different effect on whether the cofactor used was NADP(H) or NAD(H). Single mutations only produced a small decrease (2-8-fold) in the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) with NADP(H). Generally, this was because of an increase in K m values, whereas k cat values did not significantly change in the mutants. The substitution G223D did not hamper NADP+ binding (see below) or change the catalytic rate significantly, as would have been anticipated, but resulted in an enzyme that still preferred NADP(H) over NAD(H). Similar results were obtained for the T224I mutant. The H225N substitution was well tolerated as it had the least effect on NADP(H) kinetics. No pH-dependent effect was observed associated with this mutation, perhaps because in the enzyme the His residue is deprotonated at both pH 7.5 and 10.0. Single mutations provided a positive effect on NAD(H) kinetics, with a moderate increase in k cat/K m values. T224I showed the best catalytic efficiency for a single mutant, whereas H225N displayed the lowest catalytic efficiency, mostly due to its high K m values for this coenzyme. In all single mutants, k cat values for NAD(H) remained essentially constant, which is suggestive of a common rate-limiting step. At any pH employed, none of the three mutants showed a reversal of coenzyme specificity. Only the mutant T224I showed a very similar catalytic efficiency with the two cofactors at pH 10.0 (Table I). A double mutation, G223D/T224I or T224I/H225N, was the minimal change to show a clearcut effect on coenzyme specificity, both at pH 7.5 and 10.0. The effect was most marked on NADP(H) kinetic constants, especially in the G223D/T224I mutant. This mutant could not be saturated with NADP(H) and thus K m and k cat values could not be determined. Kinetic constants could only be accurately measured for the T224I/H225N mutant in the oxidative direction: K m values for NADP(H) increased dramatically (up to 200-fold) and k cat values dropped down 30-fold. Catalytic efficiency with NADP(H) decreased from 1,500 to 10,000-fold for G223D/T224I and from 100 to 1,400-fold for T224I/H225N. Both mutants showed a moderate increase in k cat/K m values for NAD(H), mostly because of a small decrease in K m values (more marked in G223D/T224I), with respect to the single mutant T224I. Overall, the double mutants showed a switch in coenzyme specificity, but without reaching full catalytic efficiency with NAD(H), which was only observed in the triple mutant. The G223D/T224I/H225N triple substitution produced a complete reversal of coenzyme specificity, both at pH 7.5 and 10.0. In comparison with the double mutants, the effect was most marked on the NAD(H) kinetics. Thus, the catalytic efficiency of the triple mutant with NAD(H) increased 30-50-fold with respect to that of the wild-type enzyme, and it was even higher than the k cat/K m value of the wild-type enzyme with NADP(H). This was mainly provoked by a decrease in K m values for NAD(H), which paralleled an increase in the affinity for the coenzyme (see below). On the other hand, the triple mutant could not be saturated by NADP(H) and the catalytic efficiency with NADP(H) decreased to about the same order of magnitude as those of the double mutants. Overall, the triple mutant was much more NAD(H) specific than wild-type ADH8 was with NADP(H). Bisubstrate kinetics were performed by covarying the concentrations of ethanol and either coenzyme, and were compatible with a Bi-Bi sequential kinetic mechanism (Table IV). In the enzymatic forms tested, K m values for ethanol (K b) ranged between 25 and 110 mm. Single substitutions had modest effects on the k cat value with NADP+ but this dropped ∼20-fold in the T224I/H225N double mutant and could not be determined in the triple mutant because saturation could not be reached. For the double mutant, this dramatic change in the k cat value with NADP+ paralleled an increase in the dissociation (K ia) and Michaelis constant (K a) values for NADP+ by 60- and 30-fold, respectively. In contrast, the k cat value with NAD+ remained relatively unchanged in all the substituted forms, suggesting a common rate-limiting step. Catalytic efficiency for NAD+, as measured by k cat/K ia K b (20Plapp B.V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 91-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), increased by 30-fold, reaching the same level as that of the wild-type enzyme for NADP+.Table IVBisubstrate kinetics of wild-type and mutant ADH8 with NAD+ and NADP+ at pH 10.0 Activities were measured in 0.1 M glycine/NaOH at pH 10.0, with ethanol as a substrate.

A substrate kinetic isotope effect of ∼2-fold was observed with either NADP+ or NAD+ in the wild-type ADH8 (Table V), suggesting that hydride transfer may be the rate-limiting step during catalysis. When using NADP+ as a cofactor, the same increase was only seen in the single mutant forms. In contrast, the double and triple mutants did not display any significant isotope effect, indicating that hydride transfer was no longer rate-limiting.

In this structure, the oxygen atoms from the extra phosphate group interact through five hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Thr224, His225, Lys228, and the nitrogen main chain atoms of Leu200 and Thr224 (Fig. 1A). In the G223D-NADP+ complex, steric and electrostatic hindrances by the side chain of Asp223 force the coenzyme phosphate to relocate in the binding site, moving away from Lys228 (compare Fig. 1, B and A). Thus, as a result of the G223D mutation, hydrogen bonds with Leu200, Lys228, and the nitrogen main chain atom of Thr224 are missing. But these losses are partially compensated by the existence of two new hydrogen bonds between the same oxygen atom of the terminal phosphate and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Leu362 and the oxygen atom of Ser3"
https://openalex.org/W2025483613,"The discs large (hDlg) tumor suppressor is intimately involved in the control of cell contact, polarity, and proliferation by interacting with several components of the epithelial junctional complex and with the APC tumor suppressor protein. In epithelial cells, hDlg protein stability is regulated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: hDlg is actively degraded in isolated cells, whereas it accumulates upon cell-cell contact. During neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells, loss of the differentiated morphology and progression toward a metastatic phenotype correlate with down-regulation of hDlg levels and loss of contact-dependent stabilization. Here we show that upon hyperphosphorylation, hDlg interacts with the β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase receptor through a DSGLPS motif within its Src homology 3 domain. As a consequence, overexpression of β-TrCP enhances ubiquitination of Dlg protein and decreases its stability, whereas a dominant negative β-TrCP mutant inhibits this process. Furthermore, a mutant Dlg protein that is unable to bind β-TrCP displays a higher protein stability and is insensitive to β-TrCP. Using RNA interference, we also demonstrate that endogenous β-TrCP regulates hDlg protein levels in epithelial cells. Finally, we show that β-TrCP selectively induces the degradation of the membrane-cytoplasmic pool, without affecting the nuclear pool of hDlg.

Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis is a highly selective, temporally controlled and tightly regulated pathway that plays crucial roles in a broad array of basic cellular processes, including regulation of the cell cycle, control of signal transduction, differentiation, and development. All of these processes involve transition states, which require the fast and irreversible destruction of specific subsets of proteins. The high specificity of the system relies mainly on the ubiquitin-protein ligases, which directly bind both the substrate and the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. At this step the entire degradation process can be regulated through diverse signaling pathways, depending upon the particular cellular conditions. Typical examples are represented by degradation of β-catenin and IκB, whose dynamic phosphorylation modulates their interaction with an SCF multisubunit ubiquitin ligase (1Hart M. Concordet J.P.

SCF (Skp1·cullin-1·F-box protein) complexes are named according to the variable F-box subunit (e.g. SCFβ-TrCP, SCFSkp2), which provides the substrate specificity. The F-box protein β-TrCP (also known as Fbw1a, β-TrCP1, E3RS, and FWD1) has been demonstrated to mediate the phosphorylation-dependent degradation of IκB (3Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I.

Besides β-catenin, several proteins are clustered at the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelial cells, where they are involved both in the structural organization of the cell junctions and in transducing signals that regulate cell proliferation. Among them is hDlg, the human homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Discs Large (DLG), which is involved in regulation of cell adhesion, apicobasal polarity, and proliferation. Mutations causing loss of DLG function result in aberrant morphology and invasive growth of epithelial cells, causing embryonic lethality (7Bilder D. Li M. Perrimon N.

Similarly to its Drosophila homolog, hDlg appears to have dual roles in governing both polarity and proliferation of epithelial cells. It has been shown that hDlg binds directly to the APC tumor suppressor via its PDZ domain 2 (20Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Science. 1996; 272: 1020-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and that formation of this complex has a role in APC-mediated cell cycle arrest (21Ishidate T. Matsumine A. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutant APC proteins that are no longer able to bind hDlg appear to be less effective in this respect. We have shown previously that in differentiated epithelial cells, hDlg protein accumulates upon cell-cell contact, being rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in isolated cells (22Mantovani F. Massimi P. Banks L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4285-4292PubMed Google Scholar). However, loss of differentiated epithelial morphology and progression toward a highly transformed and metastatic phenotype of epithelial tumor cells are associated with down-regulation of hDlg protein levels and loss of its contact-dependent stabilization (22Mantovani F. Massimi P. Banks L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4285-4292PubMed Google Scholar, 23Watson R.A. Rollason T. Reynolds G. Murray P. Banks L. Roberts S.

Significantly, the growth suppressive activities of hDlg represent a common target for several viral transforming proteins, including high risk human papilloma virus E6 (24Kiyono T. Hiraiwa A.

A. 1997; 94: 6670-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). All of these bind specifically to the PDZ-2 domain of hDlg, thereby inhibiting its interaction with APC and the consequent block of cell cycle progression (26Suzuki T. Ohsugi Y. Uchida-Toita M. Akiyama T. Yoshida M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5967-5972Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Moreover, oncogenic human papilloma virus E6 also targets Dlg for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (27Gardiol D. Kühne C. Glaunsinger B. Lee S.S. Javier R. Banks L.

The findings that hDlg forms a complex with both β-catenin and APC (20Matsumine A. Ogai A. Senda T. Okumura N. Satoh K. Baeg G.H. Kawahara T. Kobayashi S. Okada M. Toyoshima K. Akiyama T.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4285-4292PubMed Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the possibility that hDlg could be regulated through a pathway similar to β-catenin, involving the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase. Plasmids—The plasmids encoding full-length GST-Dlg fusion protein and its deletion mutant derivative GST-CT-Dlg (which contains the Dlg residues downstream from amino acids 539) were kindly provided by R.

GST-NT-Dlg (containing Dlg amino acid residues 1-382) and GST-ΔSH3-Dlg (bearing a deletion encompassing residues 549-617) plus the plasmids for mammalian expression of HA-tagged FL-Dlg and ΔSH3-Dlg proteins were all kindly provided by D. Gardiol and have been described previously (29Gardiol D. Galizzi S. Banks L. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

HA-tagged ubiquitin expression plasmid was kindly provided by C. Kühne. Dlg point mutants FL-M1 (S597A) and FL-M2 (S597A and S601A) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the Gene Tailor Kit (Invitrogen) for PCR-based mutagenesis following the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid encoding full-length GST-Dlg fusion protein was used as a template, and the obtained mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. FL-M2 Dlg was then subcloned in BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3-HA for mammalian expression. Antibodies—The production and purification of a polyclonal antibody against Dlg have been described previously (22Mantovani F. Massimi P. Banks L. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4285-4292PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-HA monoclonal antibody was from Roche Applied Science. Anti-β-galactosidase monoclonal antibody was from Promega. Rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody, anti-hDlg monoclonal antibody (2D11), and goat polyclonal anti-βTrCP antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was 9E10 hybridoma supernatant (31Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Google Scholar). Biotinylated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies plus horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-avidin were from DAKO. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse and rhodamine red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes. GST Pull-down Assays—β-TrCP was translated in vitro using the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte system (Promega) and 10 μCi of [35S]cysteine (1,000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences), as specified by the manufacturer. For β-TrCP pull-down assays, equal amounts of different GST-fused Dlg proteins bound to glutathione-linked agarose beads were incubated with a fixed amount of the in vitro translated β-TrCP protein for 1 h at room temperature in a final volume of 100 μl, in a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm EDTA. Bound proteins were washed extensively in PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40 before analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Alternatively, GST-Dlg beads were first incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with 10 μg of HaCaT cell extract in the presence of 200 μm ATP in a kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm phosphatase inhibitor 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, washed twice in binding buffer supplemented with 30 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, and then used for binding assay as above. For the phosphatase assays, after incubation with the HaCaT cell extract, GST-Dlg beads were rinsed in PBS and incubated with 400 units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for 15 min at 30 °C prior to the binding assay. Quantitation of the binding levels was done by scanning the gels using a Packard Instant PhosphorImager. Western Blotting—Cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS, lysed on ice in buffer A (50 mm Hepes pH 7.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm TPCK, and 50 μm TLCK) for 10 min, and then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay system, and equal amounts were then separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected with the appropriate specific antibodies and developed with the Amersham ECL system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitations—Cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 100 μm TPCK, 50 μm TLCK, and 30 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, incubated with appropriate specific antibodies for times ranging from 1 h to overnight at 4 °C, and subsequently mixed with either protein A- or protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 40 min. Where necessary, the anti-Dlg and anti-β-TrCP antibodies were covalently bound to the protein A or protein G using 5 mg/ml dimethylpimelimidate (Pierce) as cross-linker. Cell Culture, Proteasome Inhibition, and Transfections—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, human osteosarcoma U2OS cells, and HaCaT immortalized human skin keratinocytes were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 10% CO2. For proteasome inhibition, growing cells were treated with CBZ (N-carbobenzoxy-Leu-Leu-leucinal, Sigma, MG132) at a final concentration of 50 μm for 4 h prior to harvesting for subsequent analysis. 293 cells were transiently transfected by standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure. Measurement of Dlg Protein Stability—At 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 50 μm cycloheximide for the times indicated and subsequently harvested. The amount of wild-type and mutant Dlg proteins remaining was then analyzed by Western blot as above described and subsequently estimated by densitometric scanning. RNA Interference—Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) for human β-TrCP (32Fong A. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22111-22114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and control scrambled siRNA were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequences of β-TrCP siRNA were 5′-GUGGAAUUUGUGGAACAUCTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GAUGUUCCACAAAUUCCACTT-3′ (antisense). Transfection of 293 cells was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, the cells were seeded into tissue culture plates 12-16 h prior to transfection. About 0.6 nmol of either the β-TrCP or control siRNA was transfected per 1 ml of culturing medium. 72 h later, cells were lysed, and either RNA extraction was performed, or protein extracts were prepared for PAGE analysis. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—The efficiency of β-TrCP gene suppression was monitored by RT-PCR, using the expression of GAPDH mRNA as a control. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cultured cells with TriZol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and DNase was treated and quantified. 5 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed for 30 min at 37 °C and then for 30 min at 42 °C using 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and either the β-TrCP-specific antisense primer 5′-AGGTATGACAGAATGTTCTCA-3′ or an oligo(dT) primer. 30 cycles of amplification were then performed using either β-TrCP primers: 5′-CACTTAGACACATACAACA-3′ and 5′-TCTGCAACATAGGTTTAAGAT-3′ or GAPDH primers 5′-CATGCCATCACTGCCACCCAG-3′ and 5′-TGGTGGACCACGAGTCACATC-3′. 309-bp β-TrCP and 307-bp GAPDH amplification products were then separated on agarose gel. Immunofluorescence—U2OS cells were grown in glass slide chambers and transfected with Myc epitope-tagged β-TrCP expression vector. After 36 h the cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min, permeabilized for 4 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 and PBS, stained with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody and with 5 μg/ml anti-Dlg antibody for 1 h at 37 °C, and detected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and a Rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular Probes) for 20 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing the slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and subsequently analyzed with a Leica DMLB microscope and a Photometrics Coolsnap camera. hDlg Contains a Putative Consensus Binding Site for the F-box Protein β-TrCP—It has been reported that the F-box protein β-TrCP, which is the substrate-binding component of the SCFβ-TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex, recognizes a serine-phosphorylated consensus sequence DSGXXS (in single-letter code, where X is any residue) within its substrates. An analysis of the primary sequence of the Dlg protein revealed a motif perfectly matching this consensus: DSGLPS involving residues 596-601, which lie within the SH3 domain. Interestingly, this sequence appears to be conserved among human and rat Dlg (Sap97). Fig. 1A shows a comparison of the putative β-TrCP consensus binding site of rat and human Dlg with those of some known substrates of β-TrCP, such as β-catenin, IκB, ATF4, and Vpu. Dlg and β-TrCP Proteins Interact in Vitro—This finding prompted us to investigate whether hDlg and β-TrCP proteins could interact. We used a series of GST-fused Dlg proteins, schematically depicted in Fig. 1B. These are full-length FL-Dlg and its deletion derivatives: ΔSH3-Dlg, lacking the SH3 domain; NT-Dlg, which contains the N-terminal domain plus PDZ domains 1 and 2; and CT-Dlg, which contains the SH3 and GuK domains. These proteins were tested for binding to in vitro translated, radiolabeled β-TrCP protein. As shown in Fig. 2A, β-TrCP did not show any significant interaction with Dlg proteins in a standard in vitro binding assay. However, because β-TrCP has been shown to bind phosphorylated proteins selectively (1Hart M. Concordet J.P. Lassot I. Albert I. de los Santos R. Durand H. Perret C. Rubinfeld B. Margottin F. Benarous R. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 207-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 33Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), we repeated the assay incubating the GST fusion proteins with 10 μg of total extract of HaCaT keratinocytes as a source of cellular kinases in the presence of ATP. To monitor the efficiency of phosphate incorporation, one set of reactions was performed in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, showing that the Dlg proteins were all phosphorylated (not shown). When the pull-down assay was repeated upon incubating the beads with cell extract, both FL-Dlg and CT-Dlg, but not the Dlg mutant proteins lacking the SH3 domain, showed a greatly enhanced interaction with β-TrCP (Fig. 2A). To determine whether this interaction was indeed a consequence of Dlg phosphorylation, FL-Dlg was first incubated with cell extract and then either treated or not with λ phosphatase before the binding assay. As can be seen in first four lanes of Fig. 2B, phosphatase treatment almost completely abolished the binding of β-TrCP to wild-type FL-Dlg. Identical results were also obtained with the CT-Dlg protein (Fig. 2B, last three lanes). To assess directly whether the interaction of β-TrCP is mediated by the sequence DSGLPS spanning residues 596-601 of Dlg, we constructed two Dlg point mutants, by replacing either serine 597 (FL-M1) or both serines at positions 597 and 601 (FL-M2) with alanine residues. These mutations are depicted in Fig. 1B. As shown in Fig. 2B, mutation of Ser-597 (FL-M1) greatly reduced the interaction of Dlg with β-TrCP (from 28 to 7% of the input), whereas mutation of both Ser-597 and Ser-601 virtually abolished it. Interestingly, phosphatase treatment further reduced the residual binding of FL-M1 protein, whereas no difference was observed in the background level of interaction between β-TrCP and the M2 mutant protein. In conclusion, these results show that the Dlg and β-TrCP proteins interact in vitro. This is strictly dependent upon the integrity of the DSGLPS consensus sequence in the SH3 domain of Dlg, whereas the N terminus and the first two PDZ domains are not required. Moreover, these experiments also suggest that phosphorylation by as yet unidentified cellular kinase(s) is necessary to allow the purified Dlg protein to interact with β-TrCP and that serines 597 and 601 of Dlg are most likely involved in this process. Dlg and β-TrCP Proteins Interact in Vivo—To investigate whether the Dlg and β-TrCP proteins interact in cells, Myc-tagged β-TrCP was overexpressed in 293 cells with either HA-tagged FL-Dlg or ΔSH3-Dlg. After 36 h, the cells were treated for 4 h with the proteasome inhibitor CBZ (MG132), then harvested and immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies. The immune complexes were subsequently analyzed by Western blot. As expected, when FL-Dlg was transfected, the anti-HA antibody immunoprecipitated two bands of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 3A), whereas two bands of slightly lower molecular mass were immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with the ΔSH3-Dlg expression plasmid. When β-TrCP and FL-Dlg proteins were coexpressed, the anti-HA antibody also precipitated a protein of about 60 kDa, which corresponds to β-TrCP, because this also comigrates with the β-TrCP protein immunoprecipitated by the anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3A). Moreover, this band was absent from the anti-Myc immune complex when β-TrCP was not transfected. Vice versa, two bands corresponding to the FL-Dlg protein were precipitated by the anti-Myc antibody when β-TrCP and FL-Dlg were cotransfected but not when only FL-Dlg was present. These results clearly show that FL-Dlg associates with β-TrCP protein in 293 cells. In agreement with the results obtained from the in vitro binding assay, ΔSH3-Dlg did not coimmunoprecipitate with β-TrCP (Fig. 3A), confirming that the SH3 domain of Dlg, containing the DSGLPS binding site, is required for the interaction of the two proteins in vivo. The results of the in vitro binding assay suggest that β-TrCP interacts specifically with phosphorylated Dlg protein. To confirm this, after immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc the immunocomplex was incubated with λ phosphatase prior to gel loading. As seen in Fig. 3A (third lane), the migration of the coimmunoprecipitated HA-Dlg protein changed significantly upon phosphatase treatment, demonstrating that the Dlg protein that interacts with β-TrCP is phosphorylated. This result, together with the observation that the SH3 domain is essential for the interaction, is consistent with the data indicating that β-TrCP forms a complex with Dlg in vitro when this is phosphorylated within the DSGLPS site. Endogenous hDlg and β-TrCP Proteins Interact in HaCaT Keratinocytes—To investigate whether the endogenous hDlg and β-TrCP proteins could form a complex in human epithelial cells, immunoprecipitation of untransfected HaCaT cell lysates was performed using polyclonal anti-Dlg antiserum, and the immune complexes were then probed with anti-β-TrCP antibodies on Western blot. The experiment was also performed vice"

Most previous studies were based on the fusion assays by using model membranes. In the present study, we investigated annexin II-mediated membrane fusion by using isolated lamellar bodies and plasma membrane as determined by the relief of octadecyl rhodamine B (R18) self-quenching. Immunodepletion of annexin II from type II cell cytosol reduced its fusion activity. Purified annexin II tetramer (AIIt) induced the fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane in a dose-dependent manner. This fusion is Ca2+-dependent and is highly specific to AIIt because other annexins (I and II monomer, III, IV, V, and VI) were unable to induce the fusion. Modification of the different functional residues of AIIt by N-ethylmaleimide, nitric oxide, or peroxynitrite abolished AIIt-mediated fusion. Arachidonic acid enhanced AIIt-mediated fusion and reduced its Ca2+ requirement to an intracellularly achievable level. This effect is due to membrane-bound arachidonic acid, not free arachidonic acid. Other fatty acids including linolenic acid, palmitoleic acid, myristoleic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, and myristic acid had little effect. AIIt-mediated fusion was suppressed by the removal of arachidonic acid from lamellar body and plasma membrane using bovine serum albumin. The addition of arachidonic acid back to the arachidonic acid-depleted membranes restored its fusion activity. Our results suggest that the fusion between lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane is driven by the synergistic action of AIIt and arachidonic acid.

Lung surfactant is a surface active material synthesized and secreted by cuboidal alveolar type II cells (1Rooney S.A. Comp. Biochem.

It minimizes the surface tension at the air-liquid interface by inserting phospholipids between water molecules. As a result, surfactant disrupts the cohesive hydrogen bonds and prevents them from exerting high molecular forces at the alveolar surface. Deficiency of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine in the alveolar surface has been associated with infant respiratory distress syndrome. The secretion of surfactant by type II cells involves the translocation, docking, and fusion of lamellar bodies to the plasma membrane. For the lamellar body content to reach its extracellular destination, a continuity of the vesicular lumen and extracellular fluid must be established. This continuity is maintained through the formation of a narrow pore similar to membrane channels (4Kliewer M. Fram E.K. Brody A.R. Young S.L. Exp.

The formation of this pore is a complex event involving physical and chemical factors and is regulated by intracellular Ca2+ and proteins (7Scepek S. Coorssen J.R. Lindau M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4340-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).

However, these annexins require higher than normal physiological Ca2+ concentrations. The activity of annexin II is regulated by post-translational modifications and other cofactors. Serine or tyrosine residues near the N terminus of annexin II can be phosphorylated by protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase pp60c-Src, respectively. In vitro phosphorylation of these sites reduces the ability of this protein to aggregate vesicles without affecting its membrane binding capacity (21Johnstone S.A. Hubaishy I. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25976-25981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J.X. Waisman D.M.

Addition of cholesterol to liposome enhances the ability of AIIt to bind with and aggregate phosphatidylserine vesicles at submicromolar Ca2+ levels. Cholesterol also alters the subcellular localization of AIIt at low Ca2+ concentrations (25Ayala-Sanmartin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Ayala-Sanmartin J. Henry J.P. Pradel L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1510: 18-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid enhances AIIt-mediated fusion in model membranes (13Liu L. Fisher A.B. Zimmerman U.J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The mechanisms are not clear, but arachidonic acid itself acts as a fusogen (27Karli U.O. Schafer T. Burger M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5912-5915Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Mayorga L.S. Colombo M.I. Lennartz M. Brown E.J. Rahman K.H. Weiss R. Lennon P.J. Stahl P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have shown previously that AIIt can promote the fusion of lamellar bodies with liposomes, and this fusion is dependent on the composition of liposomes (13Liu L. Fisher A.B. Zimmerman U.J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Other groups also used liposomes to mimic granule membrane or plasma membrane (10Waisman D.M. Mol. Cell.

However, a direct biochemical analysis of the ability of AIIt to fuse plasma membrane with lamellar bodies or other granule membranes has not been reported. In this report, we established a reproducible and sensitive in vitro fusion assay of lamellar bodies and the plasma membrane. By using this assay, we performed a detailed analysis for AIIt-mediated fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane. Materials—Octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). DEAE-Sepharose CL 6B, Sephacryl S-300, Mono S, Mono Q, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. Maclura pomifera agglutinin gel was from EY Laboratories (San Mateo, CA). Protein G Plus-agarose was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Arachidonic acid (AA, C20:4), linolenic acid (C18:3), palmitoleic acid (C16:1), myristoleic acid (C14:1), stearic acid (C18:0), palmitic acid (C16:0), and myristic acid (C14:0) were from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA), and eicosanoic acid was from Alltech (Deerfield, IL). N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) were obtained from Sigma. S-Nitroso-l-glutathione (GSNO) was from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Bovine serum albumin (BSA, fatty acid-free) was purchased from JRH Biosciences (Lenexa, KS). Peroxynitrite was synthesized as described previously (23Rowan W.H. Sun P. Liu L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Annexin II antibodies were generated using purified bovine annexin II and affinity-purified (30Liu L. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Preparation of Plasma Membrane—Sprague-Dawley rat lung was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline to remove blood. The lung tissue was then blotted with filter paper and homogenized with 10 ml of buffer B (0.32 m sucrose plus buffer A (10 mm Na-Pi, pH 7.4, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 μm PMSF, 0.02% NaN3, and 10 μg/ml DNase)). Homogenate was loaded on the top of a discontinuous sucrose gradient (0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.2 m) and centrifuged at 95,000 × g for 60 min. After collecting the band from the interface between 1.2 and 0.9 m sucrose gradient, sucrose concentration was measured by a refractometer (model 334610, Spectronic Instruments) and diluted to 0.32 m with cold buffer A. The plasma membrane fraction was centrifuged at 120,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer B. To separate the inside-out vesicles from the outside-out vesicles, 1 mg of plasma membrane in 300 μl of buffer B was incubated with 300 μl of M. pomifera agglutinin beads at 4 °Cfor4hby end-to-end rotation. The outside-out vesicles bound to the M. pomifera agglutinin beads were removed by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min using an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The inside-out plasma membrane vesicles in the supernatant were used for the membrane fusion assay. Isolation of Lamellar Body—Lamellar bodies were isolated from rat lung tissue by upward flotation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient as described by Chander et al. (31Chander A. Dodia C.R. Gil J. Fisher A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 753: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A perfused rat lung was homogenized with 10 ml of 1.0 m sucrose and loaded at the bottom of a sucrose gradient (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, and 0.8 m). After centrifugation at 80,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C, the lamellar body fraction was collected from the interface between 0.4 and 0.5 m sucrose gradient. This fraction was diluted to 0.24 m sucrose with cold water and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 0.24 m sucrose containing 10 mm Tris, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0). Preparation of Tissue and Cell Cytosol—Lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, and brain were dissected from Sprague-Dawley rats. These organs were homogenized in homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EGTA, and 150 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected as cytosol. Type II cells were isolated from 180 to 200 × g Sprague-Dawley rats according to the method of Dobbs et al. (32Dobbs L.G. Gonzalez R. Williams M.C. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 141-145PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (33Liu L. Wang M. Fisher A.B. Zimmerman U.J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L668-L676PubMed Google Scholar). Type II cells were lysed in homogenization buffer by sonication on ice for 20 s and subjected to centrifugation in the same way to collect tissue cytosol. Purification of Annexins—Annexins were purified from bovine lung tissue through sequential column chromatography using DEAE-Sepharose CL6B, Sephacryl S300, and Mono S columns by the method of Khanna et al. (34Khanna N.C. Helwig E.D. Ikebuchi N.W. Fitzpatrick S. Bajwa R.X. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4852-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) as described previously (33Liu L. Wang M. Fisher A.B. Zimmerman U.J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L668-L676PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodepletion of Annexin II from Type II Cell Cytosol—One hundred micrograms of type II cell cytosol were incubated with 2 μg of affinity-purified polyclonal anti-annexin II antibody at 4 °C for 2 h. 20 μl of protein G Plus-agarose beads was added to the mixture and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking. Protein G beads (20 μl) were pre-treated with 1.0 mg of BSA at 4 °C for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding before use. Antibody-bound beads were washed three times with the homogenization buffer. The controls were treated the same way with pre-serum or without any addition of antibodies. The annexin II-depleted cytosol was tested for the presence of annexin II by Western blot and for its fusogenic activity. Isolation of Mitochondria and Microsomes—Sprague-Dawley rat lung was homogenized in 10 ml of 0.32 m sucrose containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 mm CaCl2 along with a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm benzamidine). The homogenate was centrifuged at 300 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was collected as mitochondria. The remaining supernatant was spun down at 20,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was then discarded to remove the other subcellular organelles (other than microsomes). The supernatant was centrifuged at 80,000 × g for 3 h, and the microsomal fractions were collected from the pellet (35Jobe A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 489: 440-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Incorporation of R18 into Plasma Membrane—A 20 mm stock solution of R18 was prepared in ethanol, and 1 μl of this stock solution was injected using a 10-μl syringe to 300 μg of plasma membrane in 300 μl of buffer B (the same buffer used in plasma membrane preparation) while vortexing. The mixture was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h by end-to-end rotation. To remove the excess R18, the labeled plasma membrane was dialyzed against 3 liters of buffer B overnight at 4 °C in the dark. Membrane Fusion Assay—Membrane fusion between lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane was measured according to the method of Hoekstra et al. (36Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). In this method, plasma membrane was labeled with the fluorescent dye, R18, at a self-quenching concentration. Fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane resulted in the relief of self-quenching of R18 and thus an increase in the R18 fluorescence. R18-labeled plasma membrane was mixed with unlabeled lamellar bodies in 1 ml of Ca2+-EGTA buffer at 37 °C under a continuous stirring. A base line was recorded for 2 min, and annexins or cytosolic fractions were added. Fluorescence was recorded for an additional 6 min at excitation and emission wavelengths of 560 and 590 nm, respectively. The maximal fluorescence was achieved by the addition of 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. Fusion was calculated as a percentage of the maximal fluorescence and corrected for sample dilution when appropriate. Western Blot—Protein samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 100 mA for 2 h. The blot was blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 2% (w/v) gelatin overnight. After blocking, the blot was incubated with polyclonal anti-annexin II antibodies (1:1000 dilution) in TTBS (TBS plus 0.05%, v/v, Tween 20) containing 1% (w/v) gelatin for 3 h. The blot was washed three times with TTBS and incubated with goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution) for 2 h. Finally, the blot was visualized by developing it in ECL reagents. Signals on the blot were quantified by densitometric analysis using Bio-Rad Quantity One 4.0.3 software. Extraction and Gas Chromatographic Analysis of Free Fatty Acids in Plasma Membrane and Lamellar Body—Methyl esterification and isolation of free fatty acids was performed according to the method of Liebich et al. (37Liebich H.M. Wirth C. Jakober B. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 572: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). 5 ml of high pressure liquid chromatography grade methanol was added to 150 μg of plasma membrane or lamellar body in presence of 3 μg of eicosanoic acids as an internal standard. This mixture was placed inside screw-capped vials. 100 μl of acetyl chloride was added and continuously shaken at 25 °C for 45 min using a shaking incubator. The solution was neutralized with 2 ml of 6% (w/v) K2CO3, followed by the addition of 500 μl of n-hexane. The mixture was shaken and centrifuged at 1,800 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected for GC analysis. Separation of fatty acid methyl esters was performed on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Autosystem XL gas chromatograph using a 30 m × 0.53 mm (inner diameter) DB-FFAP column from Agilent J&W Scientific (Palo Alto, CA). Helium was used as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 9.3 ml/min, and the flame ionization detector was supplied with hydrogen (40 ml/min) and air (450 ml/min). Free fatty acids were quantified by comparing their peak area with the corresponding peak area of pure standards, which were subjected to the same procedures. Other Procedures—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214409) Google Scholar) using bovine γ-globulin as standard. Phospholipid content in plasma membrane and lamellar body was directly measured colorimetrically, based on the formation of a complex between phospholipids and ammonium ferrothiocyanate according to the method of Stewart (39Stewart J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar). Absorbance of the unknown solution was read at 488 nm and compared with known amounts of a standard phospholipid solution. Type II Cell Cytosol-mediated Fusion—We first established an in vitro assay for membrane fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane using the fluorescent probe, octadecyl rhodamine (R18) (36Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). To increase the sensitivity of the fusion assay, outside-out plasma membrane vesicles, which cannot participate in the fusion, were separated from inside-out vesicles using M. pomifera agglutinin-conjugated beads. M. pomifera agglutinin has been shown to bind specifically to the luminal surface of alveolar type II cells (40Dobbs L.G. Williams M.C. Brandt A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 846: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 41Marshall B.C. Joyce-Brady M.F. Brody J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and thus inside-out vesicles cannot bind to M. pomifera agglutinin. Type II cell cytosol caused a significant fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane (Fig. 1A). Annexin II exists in alveolar type II cells and is involved in lung surfactant secretion (13Liu L. Fisher A.B. Zimmerman U.J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Liu L. Wang M. Fisher A.B. Zimmerman U.J.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L668-L676PubMed Google Scholar). To test directly whether annexin II is the protein responsible for the type II cell cytosol-mediated fusion, we removed annexin II from type II cell cytosol by immunoprecipitation using affinity-purified anti-annexin II antibodies. One fraction of the annexin II-immunodepleted cytosol was tested for the presence of annexin II, and the other was subjected to the membrane fusion assay. Western blot showed that most of annexin II was removed from the immunodepleted type II cell cytosol (Fig. 1A). The fusion activity of the same fraction was markedly reduced (Fig. 1B), indicating that annexin II is the major protein to mediate the fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane in type II cells. The addition of 5 μg of AIIt to the immunodepleted type II cell cytosol resulted in a partial recovery in the membrane fusion. Membrane Fusion with Different Tissue Cytosolic Fractions—We next tested the effect of cytosols prepared from different rat tissues on the fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane. As shown in Fig. 2A, all cytosols including lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, and brain show significant fusion activities. The kidney cytosol had the highest capability to induce this heterotypic fusion. To test whether annexin II in the cytosols is responsible for the fusion activity observed, we determined annexin II levels in the cytosol preparations using Western blot and we quantitated by densitometry. The cytosols from lung and spleen showed the highest level of annexin II, whereas the kidney showed the lowest (Fig. 2, A and B). The result suggests that the proteins mediating membrane fusion may vary among different tissues. It is worthwhile to note that type II cell cytosol had a much higher fusion activity than lung cytosol (compare Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 where 100 μg of type II cell cytosol and 1 mg of lung cytosol were used). AIIt-dependent Fusion of Lamellar Bodies with the Plasma Membrane—We purified AIIt and tested to see whether it causes the fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane by using the assay described above. In the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, AIIt causes a dose-dependent fusion (Fig. 3, A and B). At 40 μg of AIIt ∼40% fusion was observed at 6 min. AIIt-mediated fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane was also lamellar body dose-dependent (Fig. 3, C and D). We chose 10 μg of lamellar body, 5 μg of plasma membrane, and 10 μg of AIIt as our standard conditions for subsequent experiments unless otherwise noted. Specificity of AIIt—We further assessed the capability of different annexins in the induction of fusion between lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane. Except for AIIt, none of annexins tested (annexins I and II monomer, III–VI) had significant fusion activities (Fig. 4A). This result suggests that the fusogenic event of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane is highly specific to AIIt. Furthermore, AIIt-mediated fusion is specific to lamellar bodies because the substitution of lamellar bodies with mitochondria or microsome resulted in no fusion with the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). Inhibition of AIIt-mediated Fusion by AIIt Inhibitors—NEM is known to modify cysteine residues of AIIt (42Singh T.K. Liu L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 381: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Incubation of AIIt with 1 mm NEM resulted in a significant inhibition of AIIt-mediated fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane. AIIt can be also modified by protein nitration and S-nitrosylation (23Rowan W.H. Sun P. Liu L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Liu L. Enright E. Sun P. Tsai S.Y. Mehta P. Beckman D.L. Terrian D.M. Eur. J Biochem. 2002; 269: 4277-4286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The treatment of AIIt with GSNO (a nitric oxide donor) or peroxynitrite (a nitrating agent) led to a suppression of its fusion activity (Table I). Peroxynitrite is extremely unstable and decomposed rapidly in a buffer at physiological pH. The decomposed peroxynitrite in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (15 min at room temperature) did not affect AIIt-mediated fusion (data not shown).Table IEffect of different inhibitors on AIIt-mediated membrane fusionInhibitorsFusion (% Imax)% inhibitionNone16.16 ± 1.800NEM4.01 ± 0.1275ONOO-3.73 ± 1.2577GSNO3.31 ± 0.3580 Open table in a new tab Arachidonic Acid Enhances AIIt-mediated Fusion—All fusion assays above were performed in the assay buffer containing 1 mm Ca2+. We further tested the Ca2+ requirement for AIIt-mediated fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane. Fig. 5A shows that AIIt only caused the fusion at over 100 μm Ca2+. Because intracellular Ca2+ concentration is much lower than this, there must be other factors regulating the activity of AIIt in cells. Arachidonic acid has a stimulatory effect on type II cell secretory process (43Gilfillan A.M. Rooney S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 833: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and is a potential fusogenic factor (27Karli U.O. Schafer T. Burger M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2046560291,"The reaction of metmyoglobin with H2O2 was investigated in a pH range between 8.5 and 6.0 with the aid of stopped flow-rapid scan and rapid freezing-EPR techniques. Singular value decomposition analyses of the stopped flow data at pH 8.5 revealed that a spectral species previously unknown accumulated during the reaction and exhibited a Soret absorption maximum at ≥423 nm. In the EPR experiments, the new species exhibited a set of g values at 2.32, 2.19, and 1.94, indicating that the species was assignable to a ferric hydroperoxy (Fe(III)[O–O–H]–) compound. In contrast, the hydroperoxy compound scarcely accumulated in the reaction at pH 6.0, and the dominant intermediate species accumulated was compound I, which was derived from the oxygen-oxygen bond cleavage of the hydroperoxy compound. The accumulated amount of the hydroperoxy compound relative to compound I showed a pH dependence with an apparent pK a ( pKaapp ) from 6.95 to 7.27 depending on the metmyoglobins examined. This variation in pKaapp paralleled that in pKa of the acid-alkaline transition ( pKaAB ) of metmyoglobins, suggesting that the accumulation of hydroperoxy compound is controlled by the distal histidine. We propose that the H2O2 activation by metmyoglobin is promoted at the acidic condition due to the imidazolium form of the distal histidine, and we further propose that the controlled protonation state of the distal histidine is important for the facile O–O bond cleavage in heme peroxidases.

High valent intermediates such as compounds I and II, which possess an oxoferryl porphyrin π-cation radical (Por+-Fe(IV)[O]2–, where Por+ represents porphyrin π-cation radical) and an oxyferryl heme (Por-Fe(IV)[O]2–), respectively, are known to be created upon the reaction of the heme enzymes with H2O2 and to carry out various oxidation reactions (1Schonbaum G.R.

Compound I is the first detectable intermediate in the reactions of the heme enzymes previously studied, and the subsequent one-electron reduction of compound I by the substrate generates compound II (1Schonbaum G.R.

In some enzymes such as cytochrome c peroxidase (CcP), the oxidizing equivalent on the π-cation heme of compound I is rapidly transferred to an amino acid residue in the protein moiety, creating another type of compound I (CcP-type compound I), which oxidizes the substrates (2Yonetani T. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Vol. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 345-361Google Scholar). The chemical and enzymatic properties of the reaction between ferric heme and H2O2 have attracted considerable research interests to understand the reaction mechanisms of the heme enzymes. As an approach to the above-mentioned research interest, investigations on the reaction between myoglobin (Mb) and H2O2 have long been made by several groups (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J.

Mb is a single domain heme protein that primarily serves as an oxygen storage compound using the ferrous state of the heme. The ferric form of Mb (metMb) is known to be capable of reacting with H2O2, forms an analog of the porphyrin π-cation-type compound I (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol.

On the other hand, mechanisms for compound I formation from ferric heme and H2O2 in heme proteins are still under debate (20Woon D.E. Loew G.H. J. Phys. Chem.

Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed essential roles of a histidine residue at the distal vicinity of the heme, the distal histidine, which is highly conserved in peroxidases (26Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Mb (27Antonini E. Brunori M. Neuberger A. Tatum E.L. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reactions with Ligands. Vol. 21. North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam1971: 55-97Google Scholar). Based on their proposal, and also on results of recent quantum chemical studies (20Woon D.E. Loew G.H. J. Phys. Chem. A. 1998; 102: 10380-10384Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Filizola M.

Soc. 1999; 121: 10178-10185Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the catalysis of H2O2 by peroxidase has been supposed to proceed as shown in Fig. 1: a and b, H2O2 coordinates to ferric heme; c, the distal histidine then abstracts a proton from H2O2 (base catalysis), producing a hydroperoxy anion species (Fe(III)[O–O–H]–); d and e, the protonated form (imidazolium form) of the distal histidine donates its proton back to the terminal oxygen of the hydroperoxy group (acid catalysis) to assist the heterolytic oxygen-oxygen (O–O) bond cleavage, leading to the formation of compound I. Site-directed mutagenesis has demonstrated the importance of the distal histidine in peroxidases; an aliphatic amino acid substitution leads to a significant decrease in the rate of formation of compound I (28Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Kraut J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 6592-6593Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Shaw A. Brown K.A. Kraut J.

However, identification and characterization of the postulated intermediates as discernible entities were not successful. Up to now, stopped flow observations about intermediates, which form prior to compound I, upon adding H2O2 to peroxidases have only been reported for horseradish peroxidase (HRP). These studies were done on reactions of HRP with H2O2 in either 50% methanol or 100% chlorobenzene at subzero temperature (32Baek H.K. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5714-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 33Ozaki S. Inada Y. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8020-8025Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It is, however, unknown whether the reactions in organic solvents are identical to those under physiological conditions. The properties of the above precursors are also unclear, because characterizations by physicochemical techniques such as EPR and electron nuclear double resonance spectroscopies were not applied. On the other hand, studies employing cryoradiolytic reductions of oxy hemes have succeeded in EPR and/or ENDOR characterizations of Fe(III)[O–O–H]– hemes formed in heme proteins including hemoglobin (34Symons M.C.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42706-42710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These studies have indicated that the Fe(III)[O–O–H]– species are low spin. Indeed, optical absorption spectra of Fe(III)- [O–O–H]– species (λmax, ∼420 nm) are typical of ferric low spin hemes (38Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42706-42710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 39Tajima K. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1989; 163: 115-122Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and they are different from any reported spectra by the stopped flow studies described above. Therefore, in order to investigate the molecular mechanism of compound I formation and the functions of the distal histidine, it is necessary to examine whether the Fe(III)[O–O–H]– species characterized by the oxy heme reduction studies are also involved in the reactions of H2O2 and ferric heme proteins having the histidine. For HRP, however, a recent study indicated that compound I formation is complete within a very short time (∼200 μs) at ambient temperature in aqueous buffers, and identification of any precursor of compound I was difficult (40Tanaka M. Matsuura K. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Hori H. Morishima I. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1998-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to address the above problem, and also to give insights into the roles of amino acid residues that form the heme pockets of heme enzymes, we followed the reaction between H2O2 and metMb in detail. By using stopped flow-rapid scan, singular value decomposition (SVD), and rapid freezing-EPR techniques, we succeeded in detecting a hydroperoxy anion compound (Fe(III)[O–O–H]–) that is closely related to one of the postulated intermediates in the peroxidase reactions. Analyses of population changes of the hydroperoxy compound and compound I as a function of pH clearly demonstrated the involvement of the distal histidine in the reaction. Based on the present findings, we postulated mechanisms for the reaction between metMb and H2O2, and we also discussed the reaction mechanisms of the heme peroxidases. Materials—Sperm whale and horse heart metMbs were purchased from Sigma. Human metMb and its T67N mutant were expressed in Escherichia coli and were purified as described elsewhere (18Adachi S.

Each metMb dissolved in a potassium phosphate buffer was treated with a small amount of potassium ferricyanide as described previously (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to eliminate the reduced form of Mb remaining in the commercial products or in the preparations extracted from E. coli. The oxidized proteins were extensively dialyzed and further purified by CM-cellulose column chromatography (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Stopped Flow-Rapid Scan Spectrophotometry—Changes in the optical absorption were measured by using an RSP-601 stopped flow-rapid scan spectrophotometer (UNISOKU Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) (11Egawa T.

Singular Value Decomposition—Time-resolved absorption spectra, which were obtained by using the stopped flow-rapid scan spectrophotometer, were analyzed by the technique of SVD (11Egawa T. Shimada H.

In the present investigation, the rapid scan spectroscopic system allowed us to record absorption data at up to 512 points for both wavelength and time, and hence 512 × 512 data points were obtained upon each run of the stopped flow experiments. We collected data from 19 experimental runs and averaged them. Among the data thus obtained, those at every 1.62 nm from 322 to 525 nm (126 data points) and at every 3 ms from 6 to 195 ms (64 spectral scans) were selected. This time range was selected in order to cover most of the reaction period under the present experimental conditions. The data set of 126 × 64 points thus obtained was subjected to the SVD calculation. The computer program used for the calculation was described elsewhere (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol.

Kinetic Parameters in Three Component Reactions—Concentrations of chemical species in three component sequential reaction represented by Reaction 1 are by Equations 1 and 2, R→k1I→k2PReaction1(Eq. 1) [R]=[R]0exp(-k1t)(Eq. 2) [I]=[R]0k1k2-k1{exp(-k1t)-exp(-k2t)}(Eq. 3) where k 1 and k 2 are rate constants of the reaction, and [R]0 is the initial concentration of the reactant (R) (49Szabó Z.G. Bamford C.H. Tipper C.F.H. Comprehensive Chemical Kinetics. Vol. 2. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New, York1969: 1-31Google Scholar). Integrating Equations 1 and 2 with respect to time (t) from 0 to ∞, we obtained equations for total accumulated amounts of R and I in Reaction 1, and their ratio is given by Equation 3, [I]total/[R]total=k1/k2(Eq. 4) On the other hand, the equation used for determining maximum accumulation time (t max; time at which concentration reaches the maximum value) of intermediate I in Reaction 1 is found in Ref. 49Szabó Z.G.

Elsevier Science Publishing Co., Inc., New, York1969: 1-31Google Scholar as shown in Equation 4, tmax=1k2-k1lnk2k1(Eq. 5) Rapid Freezing-EPR Spectroscopy—Samples for EPR measurements were prepared by using a recently developed rapid freezing apparatus that was composed of a rapid mixing chamber and a freeze-quench device. The details of this apparatus are described elsewhere (40Tanaka M. Matsuura K. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Hori H. Morishima I. Biophys.

We mixed metMb (1 mm) and H2O2 (200 mm) solutions in a 1:1 ratio and rapidly froze the mixed solution at 77 K to obtain the frozen flakes. The frozen flakes were collected and transferred into an EPR tube, and the EPR spectra of the samples were recorded at 15 K. The freezing dead time (time period from mixing to complete quenching) of our apparatus is 200 μs at minimum and is changeable by arranging conditions such as mixing flow rate and distance between the mixing and freeze-quench devices (40Tanaka M.

Methods to calibrate the dead time were described already (40Tanaka M. Matsuura K. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Hori H. Morishima I. Biophys.

EPR spectra were measured by a Varian E-12 spectrometer equipped with an Oxford ESR-900 liquid helium cryostat. Measurements were carried out at the X-band (9.22 GHz) microwave frequency. Changes in Absorption Spectra during the Reaction between metMb and H2O2— Fig. 2A shows spectral changes observed during the reaction of 5 μm sperm whale metMb with 50 mm H2O2 in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0. The spectral changes shown here well reproduce those we reported previously for the same reaction (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As we already indicated, formation of myoglobin compound I is detectable under the above experimental conditions (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although these spectral changes might be viewed as an apparently single process of conversion from metMb (λmax, 409 nm) to ferryl Mb (λmax, 422 nm), the time profile of the absorption at an isosbestic point (418 nm) between the spectra of metMb and ferryl Mb shows formation of an intermediate (Fig. 2, inset a). The temporary decrease in the time profile is caused by the accumulation of compound I in the reaction system (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This accumulation of compound I can be observed more clearly in D2O (at pD 6.0) (11Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the kinetics of the above reaction depends on the pH. Fig. 2B shows the absorption changes of the reaction at pH 8.5 in 200 mm glycylglycine-NaOH buffer. The reaction conditions other than pH and the buffer were identical to those used for Fig. 2A at pH 6.0. Although the gross features of the spectral changes at pH 8.5 were quite similar to those at pH 6.0, the absorption at 418 nm was almost unchanged during the entire reaction period (Fig. 2b). This result indicates that compound I scarcely accumulates at pH 8.5. Detection of a New Spectral Species in the Reaction at pH 8.5—To uncover the difference in the reactions at pH 6.0 and 8.5, we analyzed the above spectral data by SVD. In general, SVD calculations transform an absorption data matrix (i.e. a set of time-resolved absorption spectra) into a product of three matrices, U, S, and V t , where the ith column of the matrix U is termed ith basis spectrum"

The mechanism by which insulin induces formation of lamellipodia in cultured cells is not known but is likely to involve activation of Src family protein-tyrosine kinases. Here we show that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTPIB) activates Src, thereby initiating the activation of a Rac-dependent pathway leading to cytoskeletal remodeling. Conversely, expression of a proline to alanine (P309,310A) PTP1B mutant, which cannot activate Src, fails to activate Rho GTPases or cause changes in actin organization. Rat fibroblasts lacking PTP1B expression do not activate Src or Rac in response to insulin and cannot reorganize actin. These results show that PTP1B, best known as a negative regulator of the metabolic effects of insulin, is required for the effects of insulin on actin organization in immortalized fibroblasts.

These results show that PTP1B, best known as a negative regulator of the metabolic effects of insulin, is required for the effects of insulin on actin organization in immortalized fibroblasts. Insulin is a potent signaling molecule that affects glucose metabolism, gene transcription, cytoskeletal structure, and cell motility (1Tsakiridis T. Tong P. Matthews B. Tsian I.E. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Downey G.P. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 2Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon insulin treatment, membrane ruffling is stimulated and stress fibers dissolve, a phenotype associated with motile cells. The molecular signaling pathways by which insulin induces these cytoskeletal alterations are largely unknown, although phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has been implicated as playing an essential role (3Martin S.S. Rose D.W. Saltiel A.R. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Olefsky J.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5045-5054Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Such cytoskeletal changes are essential for the effects of insulin on glucose transport and on transcription (1Tsakiridis T. Tong P. Matthews B. Tsian I.E. Bilan P.J. Klip A. Downey G.P. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).The Rho family of GTPases are key regulators of the actin and tubulin cytoskeleton (4Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). Certain Rho family GTPases, such as Rac, are activated downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and it is likely that the gain of membrane ruffles and the loss of stress fibers that occur upon insulin treatment of cells is related to changes in the activity of these GTPases. Indeed, Nobes et al. (5Nobes C.D. Hawkins P. Stephens L. Hall A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 225-233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that expression of a dominant interfering form of Rac inhibits insulin-mediated membrane ruffling. These findings suggest that insulin regulates the activity of Rho GTPases. However, a direct demonstration of such regulation and a description of the mechanism(s) by which this might occur have not been described.Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; SH3, Src-homology 3; PBD, p21-binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; SH3, Src-homology 3; PBD, p21-binding domain. 1B is an abundant, cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase that is a key regulator of insulin signaling.

PTP1B binds to and catalyzes the dephosphorylation of the insulin receptor and many of the effects of PTP1B on insulin signaling can be explained on the basis of this interaction (9Dadke S. Kusari J.

Res. 2001; 63: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in rat 3Y1 cells, PTP1B impedes integrin-stimulated p130Cas tyrosine phosphorylation, the formation of p130Cas/Crk complexes, extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, and cell motility (18Liu F.

Paradoxically, SV40-transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking PTP1B also display defects in integrin signaling; specifically, these cells do not activate Src properly and show delayed p130Cas phosphorylation, extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation, and cell spreading in response to plating to fibronectin-coated surfaces (25Cheng A.

Based on the phenotype of fibroblasts either over or underexpressing PTP1B, it is apparent that changes in the expression level and/or the activity of this enzyme have profound effects on the cytoskeleton. Because changes in PTP1B expression have been documented in various disease states (29Wiener J.R. Hurteau J.A. Kerns B.J. Whitaker R.S. Conaway M.R. Berchuck A. Bast R.C.J. Am. J. Obstet.

Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 696-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), it is important to understand the mechanisms by which PTP1B regulates the cytoskeleton.Here, we assess the role of PTP1B in mediating the cytoskeletal effects of insulin. We show that overexpression of PTP1B stimulates membrane ruffling through activation of Rac1 GTPase and that this activation of Rac1 GTPases by PTP1B is mediated via activation of Src family kinases. Loss of PTP1B expression compromises the ability of insulin to activate Src and Rac1 and to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton. As the insulin receptor can phosphorylate and activate PTP1B (9Dadke S.

The cells were selected by growth in 2 μg/ml puromycin, and colonies were isolated with cloning cylinders.F-actin Visualization—Control rat 3Y1, 3Y1-WT, or 3Y1-PA cells were grown on cover slips. Cells were serum-starved followed by treatment with either vehicle or insulin. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and stained with rhodamine-phalloidin for 20 min followed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20.GTPase Pull-down Assay—GST fusion proteins, PBD, and rhotekin were made and purified as described previously (35Bagrodia S.

Serum-starved control rat 3Y1, 3Y1-WT, or 3Y1-PA cells were either treated with vehicle or stimulated with insulin and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, and 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate) containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin.

Lysate protein concentrations were measured using BCA (Pierce). Protein samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were developed by a chemiluminescence method (Pierce) using alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibodies.Antisense—Control 3Y1 cells were either left untreated or treated with 10 μm of either antisense (5′-CCATTTCCATGGCGG-3′) or scrambled antisense (5′-CTAGGCATCGTGCTC-3′) oligodeoxynucleotides in the presence of Oligofectamine (Invitrogen).RESULTSEffect of PTP1B on Cell Morphology and F-actin Organization—The signaling pathways by which insulin induces cytoskeletal alterations are largely unknown. Quiescent or serum-starved cells show presence of abundant stress fibers but fewer membrane ruffles. Insulin treatment has been shown to dissolve stress fibers and induce membrane ruffling in cells (37Martin S.S. Haruta T. Morris A.J. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17605-17608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because we and others (23Liu F. Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Curr.

Res. 2001; 63: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have previously shown that overexpression of PTP1B affects the actin cytoskeleton, we asked if PTP1B could mediate any of the cytoskeletal effects of insulin in immortalized cells. For these experiments we used rat 3Y1 cells that stably express about 3-5-fold excess HA-tagged PTP1B-wild type (3Y1-WT) and a proline to alanine (P309,310A) mutant of PTP1B (3Y1-PA), which we have previously shown is incapable of associating with SH3-containing proteins such as p130Cas (19Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 27Dadke S. Chernoff J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Serum-starved control rat 3Y1 cells have few membrane ruffles but abundant stress fibers (Fig. 1B, panel a). Upon insulin stimulation, control rat 3Y1 cells formed membrane ruffles and showed dissolution of stress fibers (Fig. 1B, panel b). In contrast, 3Y1-WT cells showed simultaneous presence of membrane ruffles and stress fibers under serum-starved as well as insulin-stimulated conditions (Fig. 1B, panels c and d). 3Y1-PA cells resembled control cells under serum-starved conditions. They showed abundant stress fibers but fewer membrane ruffles (Fig. 1B, panel e) when treated with insulin they formed membrane ruffles and showed partial loss of stress fibers (Fig. 1B, panel f). These results suggest that the majority of the cytoskeletal effects of PTP1B are mediated by interactions with one or more SH3 domain-containing proteins.PTP1B Activates Rho Family GTPases—The distinctive morphological features of 3Y1-WT cells, such as the presence of membrane ruffles even under serum-starved conditions, prompted us to examine the activity of the Rho family GTPases. Rac1 and RhoA GTPases are known to regulate cytoskeletal phenotypes such as membrane ruffling and stress fibers, respectively (4Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins with the p21-binding domain of Pak (GST-PBD) and the Rho-binding domain of Rhotekin (GST-Rhotekin) were used to assess GTPase activity (35Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 36Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325PubMed Google Scholar). GST-PBD binds only to the activated form of Rac1, whereas GST-Rhotekin binds only to the activated form of RhoA. Quiescent cells show the presence of abundant stress fibers and few membrane ruffles (Fig 1B, panel a) suggesting increased RhoA and diminished Rac1 activity. Upon stimulation with insulin, the control cells gain membrane ruffles whereas stress fibers dissolve (Fig. 1B, panel b), suggesting increased Rac1 and decreased RhoA activity respectively. Measurements of GTPase activity bear out these predictions. In control 3Y1 cells, basal Rho activity is high, whereas Rac is low; and upon insulin stimulation, Rho activity decreases whereas Rac activity increases (Fig. 2). In 3Y1-WT cells Rac1 activity was elevated even under serum-starved conditions, and RhoA activity was not inhibited even after insulin stimulation (Fig. 2). GTPase activity profiles in 3Y1-PA cells were similar to those of control cells (Fig. 2). Thus, the morphological changes induced by overexpression of wild type PTP1B are accompanied by appropriate biochemical changes in GTPase activity.Fig. 2Activation of Rho family GTPases by PTP1B. Control 3Y1 or 3Y1-WT or 3Y1-PA cells were either treated with vehicle or insulin. Cells were lysed and the lysates were incubated with GST-PBD or GST-Rhotekin. GTPase pull-down assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complexes were washed with lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PTP1B Regulates Rho GTPases via Src Family Kinases— Because c-Src family kinases, via phosphorylation of GTD exchange factors and GTPase activating proteins (39Abe K.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of PTP1B expression on the activity of c-Src family kinases. In control rat 3Y1 cells c-Src family kinase was not active under serum-starved conditions as assessed by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-Src (Tyr(P)-416) antibody (Tyr-416 is phosphorylated only when Src is active) (Fig. 3A). Insulin stimulated c-Src family kinase activity in control 3Y1 cells. 3Y1-WT cells showed elevated levels of c-Src family kinase activity even under serum-starved conditions (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, under serum-starved conditions, 3Y1-PA cells displayed low levels of c-Src family kinase activity. These results suggest that PTP1B activates c-Src kinases and that this activation is mediated by SH3/proline interaction.Fig. 3Interactions of PTP1B and Src family kinases. A, control 3Y1, 3Y1-WT, or 3Y1-PA cells were either serum-starved or stimulated with insulin and lysed in lysis buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and were immunoblotted with either anti-phospho-Src (phospho-Tyr-416, upper panel) or anti-phospho-Tyr-527 antibody (middle panel); bottom panel shows expression of c-Src in whole cell lysates (WCL). B, binding of PTP1B to SH3 domains. SH3 domains from p130Cas and c-Src family kinase were purified as GST fusion proteins. Lysates from 3Y1-WT and 3Y1-PA cells were incubated with the glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to the GST fusion proteins. Following extensive washes, the proteins were eluted into SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblot (upper panel). Whole cell lysates were also analyzed for PTP1B expression (lower panel). C, control 3Y1 or 3Y1-WT cells were serum-starved and either were left untreated (N.T.) or pretreated with 10 μm PP1 for 10 min, followed by stimulation with insulin and Rac1 activity was examined by GTPase pull-down assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because PTP1B contains two proline-rich motifs that fit the consensus sequence for SH3 binding and is known to associate with selected SH3-containing proteins (19Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), we asked if PTP1B interacts with Src family kinases in vitro via an SH3/proline interaction. We found that WT-PTP1B binds to the SH3 domains of a variety of proteins, including p130Cas, Src (Fig. 3B), but does not bind to the SH3 domains of Nck or Fyn (data not shown). Consistent with our previous studies, the PTP1B-PA mutant was severely impaired in its ability to bind SH3 domain-containing proteins (19Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B). Binding of the PA mutant of PTP1B to the SH3 domain of p130Cas was completely abolished, whereas binding to the SH3 domain of Src, though not completely abolished, was greatly reduced (Fig. 3B). However, despite the robust interaction of the proline-rich domain of PTP1B and the SH3 domain of c-Src, we could not demonstrate an in vivo association between full-length PTP1B and c-Src in cells (data not shown).If PTP1B acts primarily through Src family kinases to activate Rho family GTPases, then these effects should be abolished in cells treated with a chemical inhibitor of Src family kinase, such as PP1 (46Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). We treated control 3Y1 cells and 3Y1-WT cells with PP1 and then checked for activation of Rac1 GTPase. Inhibition of c-Src family kinases by PP1 abolished Rac1 activation under serum-starved and insulin-stimulated conditions in control 3Y1 cells as well as in 3Y1-WT cells (Fig. 3C). These data strongly support the idea that PTP1B affects actin organization via activation of one or more Src family kinases.Cumulatively, our data indicated that overexpression of wild type PTP1B induced activation of c-Src family kinase in quiescent 3Y1-WT cells, leading to the activation of Rac1 GTPase further leading to the gain of membrane ruffles.Loss of PTP1B Function/Expression Suppresses Src and Rho Family GTPases Activation—If PTP1B mediates insulin stimulation of Rho family GTPases via Src, then loss of PTP1B function/expression should impair the ability of insulin to activate the Rho family GTPases. We used antisense methodology to reduce the endogenous PTP1B expression in rat 3Y1 cells (24Pathre P. Arregui C. Wampler T. Kue I. Leung T.C. Lilien J. Balsamo J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2001; 63: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 47Hassid A. Huang S. Yao J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H192-H198PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). Insulin treatment of control 3Y1 cells versus antisense-treated rat 3Y1 cells showed that c-Src family kinase was not activated in antisense-treated cells as compared with the control cells, indicating that PTP1B is required for the activation of Src, as assessed by monitoring the phosphorylation of Tyr-416 (Fig. 4A). Similarly, in the absence of PTP1B, insulin failed to activate Rac1 (Fig. 4A). These biochemical changes mirror the cytoskeletal response of cells with reduced PTP1B expression. Cells treated with antisense of PTP1B fail to form lamellipodia upon insulin stimulation (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that PTP1B is required for insulin-mediated activation of c-Src family kinase and Rac1, as well as the formation of membrane ruffles (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4PTP1B-dependent activation of Src and Rho family GTPases by insulin. A, rat 3Y1 cells were either treated with Oligofectamine alone (Con), 10 μm antisense (AS), or 10 μm scrambled (SCR) oligodeoxynucleotides. Cells were then treated with vehicle or with insulin, prior to lysis. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2015358642,"Several families of transcription factors play important roles in modulating liver-specific gene expression during an acute phase response (APR). Stat3/APR factor is the main transactivator of gene expression by the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines signaling through gp130. During an APR, fibrinogen (FBG) genes are coordinately up-regulated by IL-6 and glucocorticoids. Except for rat γFBG, attempts to demonstrate direct binding of IL-6-activated Stat3 to FBG CTGGGAA promoter elements have not been successful. Herein we show the presence of three functional type II IL-6 response elements (IL-6REs) on the human γFBG promoter and that the magnitude of Stat3 binding to these elements correlates negatively with their functional activity in reporter gene assays. Stat3-specific binding to γFBG IL-6REs was confirmed by cross-competition with α2-macroglobulin IL-6RE and specific interactions with anti-Stat3 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. All type II IL-6REs contributed to full promoter activity; however, transactivation from Site II at –306 to –301 was strongest. In contrast to a previous report, IL-6 failed to induce activation of serum amyloid A-activating factor-1/c-Myc-associated zinc finger protein (SAF-1/MAZ), and mutation of the SAF-1RE had little effect on IL-6 induction of γFBG promoter activity. In the absence of a functional glucocorticoid receptor response element, dexamethasone potentiated IL-6-induced γFBG promoter activity 2-fold, requiring promoter-proximal Site I and Site II; the promoter-distal Site III had no effect on dexamethasone potentiation of IL-6-induced promoter activity. Notably the propensity for Stat3 binding to human γFBG IL-6REs was low compared with Stat3 binding to the α2-macroglobulin IL-6RE. Together these data suggest that Stat3 transactivation via IL-6REs on FBG promoters likely involves participation of additional transcription factors and/or coactivators to achieve optimal coordinated up-regulation during an APR.

Nieuwenhuizen W. Weisel J.W. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, the fibrin clot provides a critical provisional matrix at sites of injury, inflammation, or infection in which cells can proliferate, organize, and carry out specialized functions (3Francis C.W. Bunce L.A. Sporn L.A. Blood Cells. 1993; 19: 291-306PubMed Google Scholar, 4Naito M. Funaki C. Hayashi T. Yamada K. Asai K. Yoshimine N. Kuzuya F.

Pathol. 1993; 142: 273-283PubMed Google Scholar). FBG is a dimeric molecule with each half composed of three polypeptide chains, Aα, Bβ, and γ. Three separate single copy genes encode the FBG polypeptide chains, and each gene is separately transcribed and translated. The FBG chains are rapidly assembled in a sequential series of steps by the independent attachment of the preformed Aα and γ chains, drawn from intracellular pools, to the nascent Bβ chain (6Redman C.M. Xia H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 480-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These chains, and each half-molecule, are linked by a network of disulfide bonds to form the circulating 340-kDa protein. Expression of the FBG genes is transcriptionally regulated, and in response to inflammation, hepatic transcription of the three genes is coordinately up-regulated (7Fuller G.M. Zhang Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The acute phase response is the mechanism by which the host responds to disruption of homeostasis by infection, tissue injury, or neoplasia. The major regulatory cytokines of the acute phase response are tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6, which act on the liver to change the expression of a number of plasma proteins collectively known as the acute phase proteins (APPs). Change in APP gene expression is either positive or negative depending on the relative -fold up- or down-regulation of each gene, respectively. The positive APPs are further divided into three groups depending on the magnitude of their induction. Group 1 APPs such as C3 and C4 are increased by 50%, Group 2 APPs such as FBG and haptoglobin are increased by 2–10-fold, and Group 3 APPs including C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A (SAA) are increased by 100–1000-fold in plasma. In addition, APP genes are classified into two categories based on their cytokine responsiveness. Type I APP genes are up-regulated by IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and glucocorticoids (GCs) or various combinations thereof; whereas type II genes respond to IL-6 and GCs (8Castell J.V. Gomez-Lechon M.J. David M. Andus T. Geiger T. Trullenque R. Fabra R. Heinrich P.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 237-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither tumor necrosis factor-α nor IL-1β induce expression of type II APP genes but instead frequently down-regulate their expression even in the presence of high levels of IL-6 (9Bode J.G. Fischer R. Haussinger D. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Zhang Z. Fuller G.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The FBG genes are classified as type II in that GCs act synergistically with IL-6 in up-regulation of FBG gene expression (11Otto J.M. Grenett H.E. Fuller G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 873-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several families of transcription factors play important roles in modulating liver-specific APP gene expression including the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP), nuclear factor (NF)-κB, and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat). NF-κB and C/EBP transcription factors are important in regulation of type I APP genes. IL-1β and IL-6 induce expression of C/EBP-β and C/EBP-δ, while IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α activate NF-κB. These transcription factors in turn up-regulate IL-6 production, which activates the Stat family of transcription factors; activated Stat3/acute phase response factor binds to IL-6 response elements (REs) on promoters of type II APP genes. Basal promoter elements and enhancer sequences for constitutive and IL-6-regulated expression of the human and rat FBG genes have been described (13Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28350-28356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Unlike the rat γFBG promoter, which contains three functional type II IL-6REs (14Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), only one such IL-6RE was found on the human γFBG promoter (13Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28350-28356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, unlike the IL-6REs on the human Aα and Bβ chain promoters, IL-6 induction of human γFBG promoter activity is not responsive to the presence of elevated levels of either β or δ isoforms of C/EBP (e.g. type I IL-6REs). Recently another transcription factor, SAA-activating factor-1 (SAF-1/MAZ), was shown to contribute to IL-6 regulation of γFBG gene expression in human hepatoma cells (15Ray A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Although rat and human FBG genes are clearly responsive to IL-6, the identity of the cognate transcription factors that bind to IL-6 enhancer elements on promoter regions of the FBG genes has remained elusive. IL-6-activated Stat3 binds to the type II cis-acting elements of the rat γFBG promoter (14Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar); however, no such complexes have been identified on the human γFBG promoter (13Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H.

Because IL-6-mediated Stat3 signaling plays critical roles in essential biological functions including the immune response, inflammation, hematopoiesis, oncogenesis, and embryogenesis by regulating cell growth, survival, and differentiation (for reviews, see Refs. 18Akira S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2607-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar and 19Hirano T. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar), we investigated the role of Stat3 binding to IL-6REs and transactivation of the human γFBG promoter as described in this report. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Antibodies—HepG2 cells (HB-8065) from the ATCC were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum; cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. The passage number of cells used in this report ranged from 12–18 from the ATCC stock culture. T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI), [γ-32P]ATP and [14C]chloramphenicol were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, poly(dI-dC) was from Amersham Biosciences, and oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. The following antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): goat polyclonal anti-actin (sc-1615), which recognizes multiple actin isoforms; goat anti-Stat1 (sc-7988-X); and mouse monoclonal anti-Stat3 (sc-8019-X). Dexamethasone (DEX), ethyl acetate, and o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside were purchased from Sigma, and recombinant human IL-6 was from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). Western Blot Immunodetection—HepG2 cells were grown to near confluence and then incubated in medium containing various concentrations of IL-6 for 24 h; the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed as described previously (12Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 873-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After determining the protein concentration by Bradford assay, equivalent amounts of protein from the cell lysates were resolved after reduction by SDS-10% PAGE. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the γ chain was detected by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody J88B, which specifically recognizes the γ chain of human FBG (20Odrljin T.M. Rybarczyk B.J. Francis C.W. Lawrence S.O. Hamaguchi M. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1298: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The blots were stripped and reprobed with antibody to actin to control for variability in protein loaded on the gel. Immune complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Superfect Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Transfection of HepG2 cells was performed using Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were grown to 40–50% confluence in 35-mm culture dishes and transfected with reporter construct, 5 ng of pRL-SV40 as the internal control for transfection efficiency, and pSG5 plasmid DNA to a total of 2 μg in each transfection reaction. The amount of reporter and expression vectors used in each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. After incubation with Superfect-DNA complexes for 16–18 h, fresh medium with various concentrations of IL-6 ± 0.1 μm DEX was added to the cells and incubated for 24 h. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined by the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). The wtStat3 construct and Stat3Δ55C mutant, which functions as a transdominant inhibitor, were generous gifts of Dr. H. Baumann (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY). Luciferase Reporter Plasmid Construction—Two constructs in pGL2-basic vector containing either 1359 or 954 bp of the 5′-flanking region of the human γFBG promoter were kindly provided by Dr. M. L. Tenchini from the University of Milan, Italy (21Asselta R. Duga S. Modugno M. Malcovati M. Tenchini M.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 1144-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The 954-bp promoter fragment was subcloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Progressively truncated DNA segments were prepared by PCR using different appropriate 5′-end sense primers, a constant 3′-end antisense primer, and pGL2–1359 DNA as template. The sense primers contained MluI and the antisense primers contained BglII restriction recognition sequences to facilitate cloning. The antisense primer was 5′-CAGATCTAGCCTTGTAGTGTCAGC-3′. The sense primers were as follows: pGL3-600, 5′-GACGCGTGAGAAGTGAGAGCCTATGA-3′; pGL3-400, 5′-GACGCGTTTGGTAATTCAGGTGAT-3′; pGL3-300, 5′-GACGCGTGCATCACACAGCCTCCAG-3′; pGL3-200, 5′-GACGCGTGAGCTGGGCCAAAAAGG-3′; pGL3-100, 5′-GACGCGTCCTGCCCACCCTTCTGGT-3′. Site-directed deletions of the putative type II IL-6REs on the human γFBG promoter were generated by PCR as described previously (22Hemsley A. Arnheim N. Toney M.D. Cortopassi G. Galas D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6545-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Primer sets for Δ-I (promoter-proximal) were sense 5′-GTGTGCAAAATCCTGACAGTATAGGTTGGGGGCC-3′/antisense 5′-CTATACTGTCAGGATTTTGCACACAGGTTGAAGCTCCTCC-3′, for Δ-II (middle) were sense 5′-C AGCCATGTAGAAGTTGCATCACACAGCCTCCAGG-3′/antisense 5′-GATGCAACTTCTACATGGCTGAGAGCAAACAGATATGACC-3′, and for Δ-III (promoter-distal) were sense 5′-GTCATTCATTCTAGTGAACTGGGACATGGGGGAAG-3′/antisense 5′-CAGTTCACTAGAATGAATGACCCTGGAAATACATTCC-3′. PCR site-directed mutations in the SAF-1RE were made using sense 5′-GGACTGCTATACGTATCACAGCAATGGATAATGCTTCAC-3′/antisense 5′-GCTGTGATACGTATAGCAGTCCTGGAGGCTGTGTGATGC-3′ primers. PCR products were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector for luciferase reporter gene assays; mutations or deletions were verified by nucleotide sequencing. Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (23Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). After the desired treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 15-ml conical tubes, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), allowed to swell on ice for 10 min, and then vortexed for 10 s. After centrifugation for 3 min at 1300 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in cold hypertonic buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 20 min. Cellular debris were removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant fractions containing nuclear proteins were stored at –70 °C until use. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—The sense strand used to prepare each double-stranded probe corresponding to the human γFBG IL-6REs for EMSAs is given in Fig. 3A. The rat α2-macroglobulin (α2M) type II IL-6RE that binds with high affinity to Stat3 served as a positive control (9Bode J.G. Fischer R. Haussinger D. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Double-stranded probes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC)/μl, and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin/μl as described previously (24Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Two to 10 μg of HepG2 nuclear extract and 20 fmol of probe were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and then the reaction was stopped by adding loading buffer. For supershift, the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 10 min followed by adding 1 μl of specific antibody and incubating an additional 10 min. Nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels were precleared by electrophoresis at 20 mA for 30 min at 4 °C in 1× running buffer (7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA); free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved at 30 mA for 150 min at 4 °C. The dried gels were exposed to phosphorimaging screens, and the signal was detected using a Storm 820 Phosphor-Imager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Reporter Plasmid Constructions, Calcium Phosphate Transfections, and CAT Assays—To resolve the conflict in localization of the IL-6REs on the human γFBG promoter obtained in this report using the luciferase reporter constructs with the data obtained by Ray (15Ray A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using the pCAT3 basic vector (Promega) and calcium phosphate transfection method, we essentially repeated our studies using identical γFBG promoter-CAT reporter constructs following the exact methods of Ray (15Ray A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Transient transfections were conducted by the calcium phosphate method using a mixture of DNA containing 3 μg of pCAT3-γFBG reporter plasmid, 1 μg of pSV-β-gal plasmid (Promega) as a control for transfection efficiency, and carrier DNA so that the total amount of DNA in each transfection remained constant. After incubation with DNA calcium phosphate precipitates for 17–19 h, the medium was changed, and cells were incubated with or without 50 ng/ml IL-6 for an additional 24 h. CAT activity was determined from cell extracts as described previously (15Ray A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore EMSAs were performed on nuclear extracts prepared from control and IL-6-treated HepG2 cells using the human γFBG SAF-1RE (sequence as shown in Fig. 3A) as probe and, as positive control, the SAF-1 consensus sequence from the SAA promoter as described previously (25Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7327-7335Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) following the EMSA reaction conditions described by Ray et al. (26Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4324-4332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dose-dependent IL-6 Up-regulation of γFBG Production— Previously we reported that IL-6 up-regulates FBG expression in both HepG2 and A549 cell lines (27Guadiz G. Sporn L.A. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 2644-2653Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Guadiz G. Sporn L.A. Goss R.A. Lawrence S.O. Marder V.J. Simpson-Haidaris P.J. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

To confirm this expression and determine whether increasing concentrations of IL-6 would result in elevated production of γFBG protein, Western blotting of IL-6-treated HepG2 cell lysates was performed using monoclonal antibody J88B to specifically detect the γ chain. After 24 h of treatment, IL-6 induced γFBG production in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The magnitude of γFBG induction with 50 ng/ml IL-6 was >10-fold over control in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1A). Functional assays using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system were performed to test the response of the human γFBG promoter to IL-6 treatment. Increasing concentrations of IL-6 induced luciferase activity driven by the human γFBG promoter construct pGL3-954 in transiently transfected HepG2 cells (Fig. 1B). At 50 ng/ml IL-6, the γFBG promoter was transactivated ∼30-fold over control. These data confirm that cis-element(s) within the 954-bp promoter region efficiently mediate IL-6-induced transactivation of the human γFBG promoter in HepG2 cells. Additional Type II IL-6RE Identified on the Human γFBG Promoter—While Mizuguchi et al. (13Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28350-28356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) demonstrated the lack of type I (C/EBP) IL-6RE on the human γFBG promoter region, a functional type II IL-6RE was localized to –306 to –301. The type II consensus motif serves as a docking site for IL-6-activated Stat3 to transactivate expression of Group 2 APP genes (i.e. positive APP up-regulated by 2–10-fold in response to IL-6 and also possessing the type II IL-6RE) such as the rat α2M (24Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) and rat γFBG (14Zhang Z. Fuentes N.L. Fuller G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24287-24291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) genes. However, past attempts to show Stat3 binding to the functional IL-6REs of the human γFBG promoter were unsuccessful (13Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28350-28356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Ray A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). IL-6 is a definitive inducer of expression of all three FBG genes across species (7Fuller G.M. Zhang Z. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol.

Therefore, we examined whether there might be additional IL-6-responsive elements on the human γFBG promoter by analysis of the promoter region up to –1000 bp from the +1 site of transcription initiation. By computer-assisted analysis, we looked for the type II IL-6 consensus motif CTGG(G)AA found in most Group 2 APP genes (30Hattori M. Abraham L.J. Northemann W. Fey G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2364-2368Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and the SAF-1 consensus sequence RGGGRAGGRR where R represents any purine (31Ray A. Ray B.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1584-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to the functional type II IL-6REs previously identified (13Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28350-28356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), two more putative type II IL-6REs were found. We designated these sites from promoter-proximal to promoter-distal as Sites I, II, and III, corresponding to the nucleotide positions on the human γFBG promoter: Site I, –157 to –151; Site II, –306 to –301; and Site III, –531 to –525 (Fig. 2A). No additional SAF-1 binding sites were found on the human γFBG promoter other than the one at position –271 to –262 (15Ray A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 3411-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Functional Analysis by Luciferase Reporter Assays of the 5′-Flanking Region of the Human γFBG Promoter in Response to IL-6 —To test whether each putative IL-6RE plays a role in mediating IL-6 induction of the human γFBG gene, progressive deletions of the 5′-flanking promoter region were cloned in front of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL3-basic (Fig. 2B). These constructs were transiently expressed in HepG2 cells, and the luciferase activity with IL-6 was compared with that without IL-6 to get the relative -fold induction, which represents the capacity of each promoter construct to respond to IL-6 treatment. For purposes of comparison, the promoter activity of pGL3-600, which contains three putative type II IL-6REs and one SAF-1 site, is defined as 100% activity (Fig. 2B). The loss of the distal IL-6RE in pGL3-400 resulted in a 25% loss of promoter responsiveness to IL-6 treatment (p = 0.0004). Deletion of an additional 100 bp, which, in addition to Site III, eliminated the middle IL-6RE corresponding to Site II, led to greater than 85% reduction in promoter activity in response to IL-6 (p < 0.0001). Although the deletion of the next 100 bp resulted in loss of the SAF-1 site as well as Sites II and III, the promoter activity of pGL3-200 in response to IL-6 treatment was similar to that of pGL3-300 (p = 0.8501) (Fig. 2B). Only 4% promoter activity remained in response to IL-6 in pGL3-100 in which all putative IL-6-responsive elements were deleted. These results indicate that the three putative type II IL-6REs on the human γFBG 600-bp promoter show differing degrees of responsiveness to IL-6 induction; Site II plays the most significant role in IL-6-induced gene expression, which is consistent with previous data (13Mizuguchi J. Hu C.H. Cao Z. Loeb K.R. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28350-28356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). About 25% of the transactivation potential of the γFBG promoter construct resides in the –600 to –400 region, which contains the distal IL-6RE (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that Sites II and III account for the majority of the wild type promoter activity defined by pGL3-600. While Site I has minimal transactivation potential in response to IL-6, its loss (pGL3-200 to pGL3-100) resulted in a statistically significant reduction in luciferase activity (p = 0.0110). Deletion of –300 to –200, which includes the SAF-1 IL-6RE, did not affect luciferase expression in response to IL-6 treatment (Fig. 2B).

Here, we studied the strength of the synapses between Schaffer's collaterals and CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices when they were submitted first to Ca2+-free medium containing thapsigargin and subsequently to normal artificial cerebrospinal fluid, a procedure known to trigger CCE. We demonstrate that Ca2+ influx via the CCE mechanism is sufficient to trigger robust long term potentiation of the synapses in hippocampal slices from transgenic mice with a postnatal, neuron-specific ablation of PS1, but remarkably not from wild-type mice.

Declining Ca2+ stores in the ER produce a signal, the molecular nature of which is still a matter of debate (16Putney J.W. Nature. 2001; 410: 648-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), to open store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOC) in the plasma membrane (17Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

From experiments carried out on isolated or cultured cells, it has been proposed that presenilins exert different effects on the Ca2+ store system. First, deficiency of PS1 potentiates CCE (10Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J. Ding K. Frosch M.P. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W.

Secondly, the ER calcium content, assessed by the rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] induced by thapsigargin in Ca2+-free medium, is significantly decreased in cells lacking PS1 (12Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müller U. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Thirdly, inositol triphosphate-mediated release of Ca2+ from the ER is decreased in PS1-deficient cells (12Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B.

However, until now, the modulation of the Ca2+ store system by PS1 has not been studied in neurons in situ, a more physiological preparation. Here, we aimed to study the proposed role of PS1 in calcium signaling in neurons confined within normal neuronal networks, not by direct Ca2+ measurements but by an indirect mean, more appropriate to studies in slices from adult animals. The synaptic efficiency between Schaffer's collaterals and CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices was assessed in circumstances that trigger entry of Ca2+ by the CCE mechanism. This provided a suitable system to define the effect of increased CCE in neurons that are deficient in PS1 as opposed to wild-type neurons. Based on two premises, i.e. (i) long term potentiation (LTP) induced by electrical tetanus in CA1 neurons is dependent on Ca2+ influx and (ii) Ca2+ influx by CCE is potentiated in cultured cells deficient in PS1, we hypothesized and tested that increased Ca2+ entry through CCE would be sufficient to induce LTP in CA1 neurons deficient in PS1 and not in wild-type neurons. This was achieved by carrying out experiments in hippocampal slices from transgenic mice with postnatal, neuron-specific ablation of PS1, denominated PS1(n–/–) (19Dewachter I. Reversé D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuipéri C. Van den Haute C. Spittaels K. Umans L. Sterneels L. Thiry E. Moechars D. Mercken M. Van Leuven F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with neuron-specific deficiency in PS1, denoted PS1(n–/–), were generated by targeting the PS1 gene in embryonic stem cells to contain loxP sites. The resulting mice were crossed with transgenic mice that express Cre recombinase specifically and exclusively in their central neurons under the control of the mouse thy-1 gene promoter (19Dewachter I.

The combination of thy1-Cre recombinase and loxP-PS1 gene was maintained by selection based on four independent PCR reactions performed on DNA extracted from tail-tip cuttings from the offspring. Double transgenic mice were further bred to the homozygous condition for the loxP-modified PS1 gene, to result in a neuron-specific deficiency of PS1. The PS1(n–/–) mice used in the experiments presented here were viable and fertile and have normal brain morphology and normal behavior (19Dewachter I. Reversé D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuipéri C.

Mice were anesthetized with ether and decapitated. The brain was cut with a vibratome in transverse slices (400 μm thick) in cold ACSF, which were kept afterward at room temperature until placed in a submersion recording chamber at 30 °C. Electrophysiological recording was started not earlier than 3 h after dissection to allow recovery of the slices. Only a single slice from each tested animal was investigated. The measuring chamber was perfused with ACSF (3 ml/min). Bipolar tungsten microelectrodes (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) were used to stimulate Schaffer's collaterals, whereas evoked field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were recorded in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 region with low resistance (2 megohm) glass microelectrodes filled with 2 m NaCl. Test stimuli were 0.1-ms constant-voltage pulses delivered every 30 s at an intensity sufficient to evoke an approximate 33% maximal response.

The following commercially available drugs were used: thapsigargin (Sigma), cyclopiazonic acid (Tocris, Bristol, UK), d(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (Acros), SKF96365 (Tocris), anisomycin (Sigma), and cycloheximide (Sigma). For each slice, the fEPSP slopes were normalized against the average slope over the 30 min before a specific treatment. To determine whether or not the normalized fEPSP of a group of slices submitted to the same experimental conditions was significantly potentiated (p < 0.05), the percentages of baseline measured just before the treatment and 2 h (unless otherwise specified) after its end were compared by a paired Student's t test. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) of the difference in increase of the fEPSP measured 2 h after a treatment applied to two distinct groups of slices was assessed by a Student's t test. CCE-induced LTP in Hippocampus of PS1(n–/–) Mice— Classically, LTP is induced by tetanic stimulation, and it is well known that entry of calcium ions is an absolute requirement. Here, we tested the hypothesis that LTP could be induced in PS1-deficient neurons by their overactive mechanism of CCE, i.e. the mechanism of replenishing ER Ca2+ stores. CCE was triggered by first incubating the brain slices in Ca2+-free medium containing 1 μm TG, which is known to decrease the Ca2+ stores of the ER, and subsequently exposing them to normal Ca2+-containing medium (Fig. 1). The efficacy of transmission at the synapses between Schaffer's collaterals and CA1 pyramidal cells of the hippocampus was measured with extracellular microelectrodes in the classical manner. In slices of wild-type mice, Ca2+-free perfusion medium resulted in a complete synaptic blockage, evidently by blocking all neurotransmitter release. Upon reperfusion of non-transgenic slices with Ca2+-containing medium, the slope of the fEPSP began to recover after about 10 min and subsequently stabilized at control levels over the entire observation period (Fig. 1). After 2 h, the slope of the fEPSP was 96.5 ± 9.7% (mean ± S.D., n = 6), i.e. practically unchanged relative to the resting values. The very small variation on these measurements demonstrated the extremely reproducible nature of the response in the six independent control mice analyzed (Fig. 1). In contrast, this protocol of induction of CCE caused a dramatic increase in the slope of the fEPSP in hippocampal slices from PS1(n–/–) mice (Fig. 1). Two h after stopping the perfusion with TG/Ca2+-free medium, the slope of the field EPSP was increased to 174.8 ± 18.7% (n = 6) of the basal value (p < 0.001). This effect was not unique for TG since another agent known to block ER-based calcium pumps and thereby to deplete the ER Ca2+ stores, i.e. cyclopiazonic acid, produced qualitatively the same effect (Fig. 2). Two h after stopping superfusion of the slices with 2 μm cyclopiazonic acid in calcium-free medium, the slope of the fEPSP was also markedly enhanced in CA1 neurons in sections from PS1(n–/–) mice (135.0 ± 12.6%, n = 4, p < 0.05) but did not increase at all in slices derived from non-transgenic mice (93.2 ± 6.0%, n = 4) (Fig. 2). These results demonstrated that a protocol known to induce an entry of Ca2+ through the CCE mechanism was able to trigger an LTP in CA1 neurons deficient in PS1, but not in normal ones. Origin of Ca2 + Influx—LTP induced by incubation in TG/Ca2+-free medium was completely blocked by the CCE inhibitor SKF96365 (10Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E.

Neuron. 2000; 27: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) when the slices were pretreated for 3 h with 30 μm (relative change versus baseline: 107.8 ± 10.5%, n = 4, p = 0.12) (Fig. 3A). Because tetanus-induced LTP in the hippocampal CA1 neurons is triggered by an entry of Ca2+ through the NMDA receptors, we also investigated a potential role of these channels on the TG/Ca2+-free induced LTP (Fig. 3B). Brain slices from PS1(n–/–) mice were submitted to the TG/Ca2+-free protocol in the presence of 50 μm APV, a well known antagonist of the NMDA receptor. APV modified neither the profile of the CCE-induced LTP nor its amplitude measured 2 h after application of TG/Ca2+-free treatment. The values of the fEPSP were 158.9 ± 11.0% (n = 4) in the presence of APV (Fig. 3B) versus 174.8 ± 18.7% (n = 6) in the absence of APV (Fig. 1, p = 0.16). Relationship between CCE-induced LTP and Tetanus-induced LTP—Tetanus-evoked LTP occluded the induction of TG/Ca2+-free induced LTP (Fig. 4). Thirty min after the induction of strong LTP by three tetanic stimulations (1 s, 100 Hz) separated from each other by 10 min, the stimulation intensity was reduced to obtain fEPSP with amplitudes corresponding to the control values. Ten min later, the slice was submitted to the Ca2+-free medium containing 1 μm TG for 30 min. In this situation, subsequent TG/Ca2+-free treatment did not induce LTP since after 1 h, the fEPSP was measured to be 95.2 ± 4.1% (n = 4) relative to basal values (p = 0.50). However, the converse was not true since the LTP induced by TG/Ca2+-free medium did not occlude subsequent tetanus-evoked LTP (Fig. 5A). Two h after the induction of LTP by TG/Ca2+-free treatment, the stimulation intensity was reduced to obtain fEPSP with amplitudes corresponding to the control values for 15 min. A single tetanus (1 s, 100 Hz) applied at that moment evoked LTP, i.e. 30 min after the application of the tetanus, fEPSP was 145.3 ± 20.4% of control values (n = 4, p < 0.05). To rule out the possibility that the observed absence of occlusion of tetanus-induced LTP by CCE-induced LTP(Fig. 5A) was due to the fact that the CCE-induced LTP was not saturated yet at the moment of the application of the electrical tetanus, the following control experiment was performed (Fig. 5B). Two h after the induction of LTP by TG/Ca2+-free treatment, the stimulation intensity was reduced to obtain fEPSP amplitudes corresponding to baseline for 15 min. A second TG/Ca2+-free treatment applied at that time did not induce any LTP since 90 min after the second stimulus, the fEPSP was measured to be 97.9 ± 5.5% (n = 4) relative to basal values (p = 0.35) CCE-induced LTP and Protein Synthesis—To investigate whether CCE-induced LTP was dependent on protein synthesis, we applied anisomycin, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, for 30 min before, during (30 min), and for 30 min after perfusion of the slices with a Ca2+-free medium containing thapsigargin. Pretreatment with anisomycin completely abolished the synaptic enhancement induced by TG/Ca2+-free treatment in PS1(n–/–) mice (98.3 ± 15.6, n = 4, p = 0.94) (Fig. 6A). To demonstrate that the effect of anisomycin was related to inhibition of protein synthesis and not to another effect of the drug, which is also a potent activator of stress-activated protein kinases (JNK/SAPK) and p38 MAP kinase, we tested the effect of cycloheximide, an unrelated inhibitor of protein synthesis, at a concentration of 60 μm according to the same temporal pattern as anisomycin. Cycloheximide also nearly completely blocked CCE-induced LTP in PS1(n–/–) mice (Fig. 6B). Two h after the TG/Ca2+-free treatment, the fEPSP was as low as 113.7 ± 13.5% (n = 5) relative to basal values (p = 0.34). We conclude that CCE-induced LTP was dependent on protein synthesis. Mutant PS1 and CCE-induced LTP—Cultured neurons and fibroblasts harboring a mutant PS1 causing familial Alzheimer's disease have markedly reduced CCE (10Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J. Ding K. Frosch M.P. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W.

Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We therefore predicted that the protocol based on TG/Ca2+-free triggering would not produce LTP in CA1 neurons in brain slices from mutant PS1 mice. This prediction was proven in slices from the brain of transgenic mice that express the early onset cases of familial Alzheimer's disease mutant PS1(A246E) (13Schneider I. Reversé D. Dewachter I. Ris L. Caluwaerts N. Kuipéri C. Gilis M. Geerts H. Kretzschmar H. Godaux E. Moechars D. Van leuven F. Herms J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11539-11544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Indeed, the TG/Ca2+-free medium was unable to induce significant hippocampal LTP in PS1(A246E) slices since after 2 h of TG/Ca2+-free perfusion, the slope of the fEPSP was 99.2 ± 22.4% (n = 5, p = 0.49) (Fig. 7). The major finding of this work is the following. The treatment applied to the hippocampal slices, which is Ca2+-free/thapsigargin followed by normal ACSF, induced an LTP of the synaptic strength between Schaffer's collaterals and CA1 neurons in PS1(n–/–) mice but not in wild-type mice. Such an LTP was due to Ca2+ entry by the CCE mechanism, as it was blocked by an agent known to block CCE (SKF96365). This is thus experimental evidence obtained on brain slices where neuronal networks were intact, and not based on isolated or cultured neurons, for a role of presenilin 1 in the refilling mechanism of the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Before discussing the relationships between CCE-induced LTP and tetanus-induced LTP, it is worth remembering the characteristics of the classical tetanus-induced LTP whose major actors are shown below (see Fig. 8). LTP caused by multiple trains of high frequency electrical stimulation can be divided into two phases: (i) an early phase, consisting of an induction mechanism and an early maintenance phase; and (ii) a late phase, which is a maintenance phase (21Kandel E.R. Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). Induction is triggered by initial increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in dendritic spines due mainly to Ca2+ entry through NMDA receptors (22Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2240) Google Scholar). In this induction phase, activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (23Giese K. Fedorov N. Filipkowski R. Silva A. Science. 1998; 279: 870-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) but also of protein kinase C (24Huang Y.Q. Lu W.Y. Ali D.W. Pelkey K.A. Pitcher G.M. Lu Y.M. Aoto H. Roder J.C. Sasaki T. Salter M.W. MacDonald J.F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 485-496Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) are believed to play a pivotal role. In contrast to the early phase, the late maintenance phase of tetanus-induced LTP requires new protein synthesis (25Deadwyler S.A. Dunwiddie T. Lynch G. Synapse. 1987; 1: 90-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R. Learn Mem. (Cold Spring Harb.). 1994; 1: 74-82PubMed Google Scholar, 27Frey U. Morris G.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 533-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). This is triggered by a cascade initiated by still another kinase, the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), which is activated by the large Ca2+ influx provoked by repeated trains of action potentials (21Kandel E.R. Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar, 28Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). All the signaling pathways underlying the tetanus-induced LTP (both early and late phases) are unaffected by genetic ablation of PS1 (19Dewachter I. Reversé D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuipéri C. Van den Haute C. Spittaels K. Umans L. Sterneels L. Thiry E. Moechars D. Mercken M. Van Leuven F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yu H. Saura C.A. Choi S.Y. Sun L.D.

Neuron. 2001; 31: 713-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In PS1(n–/–) mice, calcium entering the neurons through the CCE mechanism triggers long term potentiatiation by activating only pathway(s) involved in tetanus-induced LTP (since tetanus-induced LTP occludes CCE-induced LTP), although not all of them (since CCE-induced LTP does not occlude tetanus-induced LTP). One of the shared pathways is that leading to the late phase of tetanus-induced LTP. Indeed, CCE-induced LTP and the late phase of tetanus-induced LTP share the property of being protein synthesis-dependent. PS1 is a serpentine protein known to be localized mainly in the ER. At the postsynaptic level, it is not clear whether the changes of CCE induced by a PS1 deficiency take place in the dendritic spines, in the dendritic shafts, and/or in the cell soma. Whereas the presence of functional ER calcium stores in the spines of hippocampal CA1 is attested by the fact that ryanodine receptors are enriched in dendritic spines (30Sharp A.H. McPherson P.S. Dawson T.M. Aoki C. Campbell K.P. Snyder S.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3051-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), subsurface cisterns of ER are closely apposed to the plasma membrane of the soma (14Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). It is clear that Ca2+ entering the dendritic spines by the CCE mechanism could have access to the signaling pathways of the tetanus-induced LTP. However, even if the increased CCE in PS1(n–/–) mice was confined to the soma, it could be sufficient to activate the late maintenance component of the tetanus-induced LTP. Indeed, APV blocks the early phase of LTP but not the late phase of LTP, whereas nifedipine, which blocks L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCC), attenuates the late phase of LTP (28Impey S. Mark M. Villacres E.C. Poser S. Chavkin C. Storm D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). This suggests that the late phase of tetanus-induced LTP is triggered by Ca2+ ions, which enter not only through NMDA receptors but also through L-type VDCC channels. In this regard, it is interesting to note that L-type VDCC are localized in the somatic membrane and proximal dendrites (31Westenbroek R.E. Ahlijanian M.K. Catterall W.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Thus, entry of Ca2+ through SOC located in the plasma membrane of the soma or of the dendritic spines could be responsible for the induced enhancement of the synaptic strength. Because functional calcium stores are present not only in the soma and dendrites, but also in synaptic boutons (32Emptage N.J. Reid C.A. Fine A. Neuron. 2001; 29: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 33Llano I. González J. Caputo C. Lai F.A. Blayney L.M. Tan Y.P. Marty A. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), a possible presynaptic mechanism responsible for the CCE-induced LTP in the PS1(n–/–) mice deserves further discussion. In synaptic terminals of CA3 pyramidal cells, a presynaptic action potential causes a transient increase in Ca2+ due primarily to an entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular space through the VGCC but also to a calcium-induced release of calcium by the presynaptic calcium stores (32Emptage N.J. Reid C.A. Fine A. Neuron. 2001; 29: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that a depletion of the Ca2+ stores in presynaptic terminals by cyclopiazonic acid or TG induced a decrease in the calcium transients evoked by action potentials in presynaptic boutons. However, as this effect is a decrease and as it does not affect the amplitude of EPSPs caused by single stimuli, it cannot be responsible for the increase in synaptic strength observed in CCE-induced LTP. Pharmacologically induced depletion of Ca2+ stores in synaptic boutons also causes another effect, i.e. it activates the store-operated channels of the presynaptic membrane. The resulting continuous influx of calcium through the SOC then increases the frequency of the miniature EPSPs (32Emptage N.J. Reid C.A. Fine A. Neuron. 2001; 29: 197-208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). This mechanism, however, is not involved in the CCE-induced LTP either since an increased rate of spontaneous transmitter release would act at the synapses through the NMDA receptors, whereas CCE-induced LTP is not blocked by APV (Fig. 3B) The next question is how CCE enhances synaptic strength in the absence of PS1 and not in its presence. The first possibility is that the amount of Ca2+ entering the cell by the CCE mechanism is increased by the absence of PS1 and so sufficient to reach the threshold level needed to trigger the signal cascades leading to an increased synaptic efficacy (Fig. 8, A and B). By measuring the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytosol of cultured cells, it has been demonstrated that genetic ablation of PS1 resulted in: (i) an increased entry of Ca2+ by the CCE mechanism (10Yoo A.S. Cheng I. Chung S. Grenfell T.Z. Lee H. Pack-Chung E. Handler M. Shen J. Xia W. Tesco G. Saunders A.J. Ding K. Frosch M.P. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W. Neuron. 2000; 27: 561-572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and (ii) a decrease in their ER-Ca2+ stores (12Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müller U. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). LaFerla's group (11Leissring M.A. Akbari Y. Fanger C.M. Cahalan M.D. Mattson M.P. LaFerla F.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) had proposed previously that CCE was activated when calcium levels within the lumen of the ER fell below a threshold level. According to these authors, CCE would be increased in PS1 knock-out cells because their ER-Ca2+ stores are abnormally low (12Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müller U. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). A second possibility that could explain how CCE induces LTP in PS1 knock-out neurons and not in control neurons is that the absence of PS1 would not modify the amount of Ca2+ entering by the CCE mechanism, but instead its access to its targets. PS1 could structurally help to position and maintain SOC close to SERCA pumps at the level of the subsurface cisterns of the ER, thus organizing a local “signaling microdomain” (34Delmas P. Wanaverbecq N. Abogadie F.C. Mistry M. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 14: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In this case, Ca2+ ions entering through SOC would either be readily pumped into the ER in the absence of thapsigargin or be locally “trapped” when SERCA is blocked irreversibly by thapsigargin (Fig. 9A). In the absence of PS1, clustering of SOC and their apposition in front of subsurface cisterns of ER would be lost, and Ca2+ entering through SOC would no longer be locally trapped between the membrane of the cell and that of the corresponding subsurface cistern. That would allow Ca2+ to have direct access to its target the adenylate cyclase and hence activate PKA and trigger enhanced synaptic strength (Fig. 9B). A final question, not addressed in this study but most interesting to raise, is whether the increase in CCE observed in PS1-deficient mice is related to their evident inhibition of γ-secretase activity (19Dewachter I. Reversé D. Caluwaerts N. Ris L. Kuipéri C. Van den Haute C. Spittaels K. Umans L. Sterneels L. Thiry E. Moechars D. Mercken M. Van Leuven F. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3445-3453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, the first two effects were claimed to be mimicked by γ-secretase inhibitors (12Leissring M.A. Murphy M.P. Mead T.R. Akbari Y. Sugarman M.C. Jannatipour M. Anliker B. Müller U. Saftig P. De Strooper B. Wolfe M.S. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is most interesting to note that PS1 acts on CCE directly, independently of APP, as observed in neurons from APP-null mice (35Van Leuven F. Dewachter I. Herms J. Godaux E. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: S243Google Scholar). It is clear that fundamentally we do not fully understand the diverse functions of PS1 and the context of its dual function in regulated proteolytic activity and in calcium signaling.

EC 2.1.2.1) catalyzes the reversible transfer of Cβ of serine to tetrahydropteroylglutamate (H4PteGlu) to form glycine and 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu. In Eukarya and Eubacteria, H4PteGlu functions as a carrier of C1 units in several oxidation states, which are used in the biosynthesis of important cellular components, such as purines and thymidylate, in the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine or, in acetogenic bacteria, in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA. The reaction catalyzed by SHMT represents in these organisms one of the major loading routes of C1 units onto the folate carrier (1Schirch L. Blakley R.L. Benkovic S.J. Folates and Pterins. Vol I. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1984: 399-431Google Scholar). In methanogens and several other Archaea, C1 fragments from formyl to methyl oxidation levels are carried by tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT), a pterin-containing compound involved in methanogenesis. Although H4PteGlu and H4MPT are structurally similar in their pterin-like portion (Fig. 1) and in the role as C1 units carriers, they are functionally distinct. H4MPT does not appear to be suited to most of the biosynthetic functions of H4PteGlu. Moreover, the biosynthetic pathways of the two carriers have few, if any, homologies, suggesting the possibility of separate evolutionary origins (2Maden B.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 509-529Crossref Google Scholar). In the metabolism of folates, SHMT represents a unique link between Archaea and the rest of living beings, in the sense that, whereas all SHMTs clearly share a common evolutionary origin (3Paiardini A. Gianese G. Bossa F. Pascarella S. Proteins. 2003; 50: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), other enzymes that use H4MPT as cofactor do not show any significant homology to their eukaryotic and eubacterial counterparts (2Maden B.E.

Although a gene encoding SHMT is present in all archaeal genomes so far sequenced, little information is available on the catalytic properties and metabolic role of the enzyme in these organisms. Modified folates are not commercially available, and this has clearly hindered a satisfactory characterization of archaeal SHMTs. Moreover, the purification of the enzyme from Archaea that thrive in extreme environments is complicated by the difficulty of growing these organisms in a laboratory. Two reports of purified SHMT activity, from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum (4Hoyt J.C. Oren A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 153-158Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), recently renamed Methanothermobacter marburgensis (5Wasserfallen A. Nolling J. Pfister P. Reeve J. Conway de Macario E. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2000; 50: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and from Sulfolobus solfataricus (6Delle Fratte S. White R.H. Maras B. Bossa F. Schisch V. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7456-7461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with limited structural and functional characterization, have been made. In the first report, the enzyme was proposed to function in vivo in the direction of serine biosynthesis. Importantly, both works provided evidence that SHMT was selective toward the modified folate used by the source organisms: H4MPT for M. marburgensis and sulfopterin for S. solfataricus (2Maden B.E. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 509-529Crossref Google Scholar, 7White R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1987-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study reports on the purification of recombinant SHMT from Methanococcus jannaschii (mjSHMT) and the characterization of its catalytic and thermodynamic properties. The aim of the research was to assess the extent to which mjSHMT is structurally and mechanistically similar to its prokaryotic and eukaryotic counterparts. Materials—Ingredients for bacterial growth were from Difco. Chemicals used in the purification procedure were from BDH, and DEAE-Sepharose and phenyl-Sepharose were from Amersham Biosciences. Enzymes used for the cloning procedures were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. SHMT from Escherichia coli (eSHMT) was expressed and purified as described previously (8Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides used in the PCR reaction were from MWG Biotech. (6S)-H4PteGlu was a gift from A. G. Eprova, Schaffhausen, Switzerland. All other reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. The bifunctional enzyme methylene-H4PteGlu dehydrogenase/methenyl-H4PteGlu cyclohydrolase from E. coli was purified from a recombinant E. coli bacterial strain kindly provided by Dr. Martino di Salvo (Università “La Sapienza,” Rome, Italy) following the procedure described previously (9Fu T.F. di Salvo M. Schirch V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 290: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). NADP-dependent methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase from Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 and H4MPT purified from M. marburgensis were kindly provided by Rolf Thauer (Max-Planck-Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, Marburg, Germany). The thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobium brockii employed in the threonine aldolase assay was from Sigma-Aldrich. Cloning of the glyA Gene from M. jannaschii—A pUC18 plasmid with a 1686-bp insert containing the gene encoding mjSHMT was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. This plasmid (AMJK15) was used as template in a PCR amplification that used 5′-GGGATACATATGGAATATTCGG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-GCGAATTCTTAATAGAATCTTAG-3′ (downstream) oligonucleotides as primers. NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites were introduced in the primers to insert the amplified 1287-bp DNA fragment into a pET22b expression plasmid (Novagen), which was used to transform E. coli HMS174 (DE3) cells (Novagen). The nucleotide sequence of the insert was determined to confirm that no mismatching had occurred during the PCR amplification. Expression and Purification—A 100-ml overnight culture of E. coli HMS174 (DE3) cells, transformed with the mjSHMT overexpressing plasmid, was inoculated into 3 liters of Luria-Bertani broth containing ampicillin (100 mg/liter) and grown aerobically at 37 °C to exponential phase (A 600 = 0.3–0.4). Expression of mjSHMT was then induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 20 h, cells were harvested and suspended in 100 ml of 50 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6. Cell lysis was obtained by the addition of 1 mg of lysozyme per g of packed bacterial cells. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, the cells were frozen overnight at –20 °C. After thawing, streptomycin sulfate (10 g/liter) was added to precipitate DNA. The cell extract was then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was discarded. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the yellow supernatant to 60% saturation. The solution was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was discarded. The supernatant was directly loaded onto a phenyl-Sepharose column (5 × 15 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing ammonium sulfate to 30% saturation. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and the protein was eluted using a 600-ml linear gradient from the equilibrating buffer to 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Fractions containing SHMT, detected spectrophotometrically, pooled, and concentrated using centrifuge concentrators (30 kDa cut-off; Vivaspin, Sartorius) to a volume of about 20 ml, were heat-treated for 15 min at 75 °C to precipitate most of the host cell proteins. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant containing mjSHMT and a few other proteins was loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (3 × 10 cm) that had been equilibrated with 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. The column was washed with 100 ml of the same buffer, and the protein was then eluted with a 500-ml linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Fractions were pooled and concentrated as in the previous step. The purity of the mjSHMT sample was checked by SDS-PAGE and judged to be ≥98%. The protein concentration was determined measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using a ϵ280 = 34990 m–1 cm–1, calculated according to Ref. 10Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar. Molecular Mass Estimation by Size-exclusion Chromatography—The molecular mass of the native enzyme was estimated by size-exclusion chromatography at 20 °C on a Superose 12 column (Amersham Biosciences), eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 0.15 m NaCl, controlled by a Dionex pump. Elution was monitored at 280 and 226 nm. The Superose column was calibrated with horse spleen apoferritin (440 kDa, elution volume V e = 8.0 ml), catalase (232 kDa, V e = 9.1 ml), rabbit muscle aldolase (158 kDa, V e = 9.3 ml), BSA (67 kDa, V e = 9.8 ml), egg albumin (43 kDa, V e = 10.4 ml), chymotrypsin (25 kDa, V e = 12 ml), and ribonuclease (13.7 kDa, V e = 12.5 ml). V e of the purified SHMT was 9.6 ml. Molecular Mass Estimation by Analytical Ultracentrifugation—All experiments were conducted at 20 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics. The protein concentration was in the range of 0.2 to 1.0 mg/ml. Sedimentation velocity experiments were done at 40,000 rpm. Data were collected at 280 nm at a spacing of 0.005 cm with three averages in a continuous scan mode and were analyzed with the program Sedfit (11Schuck P. Rossmanith P. Biopolymers. 2000; 54: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficients were corrected to s 20, w using standard procedures. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed at 16,000, 19,000 and 22,000 rpm. Data were collected at 280 nm at a spacing of 0.001 cm with 10 averages in a step scan mode. Establishment of equilibrium was checked by comparing scans up to 24 h. Data sets were edited with REEDIT (J. Lary, National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center, Storrs, CT) and fit with NONLIN (PC version provided by E. Braswell, National Analytical Ultracentrifugation Center, Storrs, CT) (12Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Data from different speeds were combined for global fitting. Fits to a single species give a Z-average molecular weight. For fits to a monomer-dimer association scheme, the monomer molecular weight was fixed at the value determined from the amino acid sequence. The experiments were performed in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and in 20 mm sodium formate, pH 3.0, containing 200 μm DTT and 100 μm EDTA. Kinetic Studies—With serine and H4MPT as substrates, the rate of 5,10-methylene-H4MPT production was determined by oxidizing this compound to 5,10-methenyl-H4MPT, using NADP+ and methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase from M. extorquens AM1. The initial rate of the reaction, carried out in 75 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, at 37 °C, was calculated from the absorbance change at 340 nm because of NADPH and methenyl-H4MPT formation, using a value of ϵ340 = 27 000 m–1 cm–1 (13Vorholt J.A. Chistoserdova L. Lidstrom M.E. Thauer R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The same procedure was employed when H4PteGlu was the pteridine substrate, except that the coupled enzyme employed in the assay was the bifunctional methylene-H4PteGlu dehydrogenase/methenyl-H4PteGlu cyclohydrolase from E. coli, and the ϵ340 used in the calculation was 7200 m–1 cm–1 (8Schirch V. Hopkins S. Villar E. Angelaccio S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1-7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture included mjSHMT at either 0.1 μm, when H4MPT was the pteridine substrate, or 14 μm, when H4PteGlu was used. Kinetic parameters were determined either under anaerobic conditions (N2 pressure equal to 0.3 bar) or in the presence of air, varying the concentration of one substrate while the second was kept constant. The dependence of the initial velocity of the reaction on H4MPT concentration was determined maintaining l-serine at 30 mm and varying H4PteGlu concentration between 0.162 and 0.45 mm.H4MPT was 0.162 mm when serine was varied between 0.09 and 30 mm. The formaldehyde was measured mixing aliquots of the reaction mixture, taken at time intervals, with an equal volume of 0.2% (w/v) 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine in 1 m HCl. The resulting colored solution was diluted in 1 m HCl and used to measure the increase in absorbance at 380 nm because of the formation of a dinitrophenyl hydrazone derivative. For this derivative, a calibration curve, obtained previously using commercial formaldehyde, gave a ϵ380 = 57120 m–1 cm–1. Retroaldol cleavage reactions were carried out in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. The rate of allo-threonine cleavage was measured by coupling the reaction with reduction of the product acetaldehyde by NADH and thermostable alcohol dehydrogenase from T. brockii (14Schirch V. Peterson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7801-7806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of the reaction was calculated from the rate of decrease in absorbance at 340 nm, using a value of ϵ340 = 6220 m–1 cm–1. Benzaldehyde production from phenylserine cleavage was measured spectrophotometrically at 279 nm, using a molar absorptivity value of ϵ279 = 1400 m–1 cm–1 (15Ulevitch R.J. Kallen R.G. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5342-5350Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The rate of transamination with both alanine enantiomers was determined according to Ref. 16Shostak K. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8007-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. Kinetic data analysis, curve-fitting procedures, and statistical analysis were performed using the data manipulation software of Scientist (Micromath, Salt Lake City, UT). Spectroscopic Techniques—Fluorescence emission measurements were carried out at 20 °C with a LS50B spectrofluorimeter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 300–450 nm (1-nm sampling interval) with the excitation wavelength set at 295 nm. PLP emission fluorescence was monitored between 330 and 600 nm exciting at 285, 320, and 418 nm. CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. Far-UV-CD spectra (190–250 nm) were measured in a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette, and near-UV-CD spectra (250–310 nm) and visible-CD spectra (310–500 nm) were measured in a 1.0-cm path length quartz cuvette. The results are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity ([Θ]) assuming a mean residue weight of 110 Da per amino acid residue. In all the spectroscopic measurements, 200 μm DTT and 100 μm EDTA were added unless otherwise stated. UV-visible spectra were recorded with a double-beam Lambda 16 PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrometer equipped with a Peltier thermocontroller set at 20 °C. Urea-induced Unfolding Equilibrium—Protein samples, at 0.12 mg/ml final concentration, were incubated at 20 °C with increasing concentrations of urea (0–7.9 m) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, or in 20 mm sodium formate, pH 3.0, in the presence of 200 μm DTT and 100 μm EDTA. After 24 h, a time that was tested to be sufficient to reach equilibrium, far-UV-CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C. To probe the reversibility of the unfolding process, the protein (1.9 mg/ml) was incubated at 20 °C with 7.9 m urea in 20 mm formate, pH 3.0, in the presence of 3.2 mm DTT and 1.6 mm EDTA. After 24 h, the refolding was started by a 16-fold dilution with the same buffer used for the unfolding, containing decreasing denaturant concentrations. The final protein concentration was 0.12 mg/ml. After 2 h, a time that was established to be sufficient to reach equilibrium, far-UV-CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C. Data Analysis—Far-UV-CD spectra from urea titration were analyzed by the singular value decomposition algorithm (SVD) (17Henry E.R. Hofrichter J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 129-192Crossref Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 18Ionescu R.M. Smith V.F. O'Neill Jr., J.C. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9540-9550Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 19Johnson Jr., W.C. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 426-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using the software MATLAB (MathWorks, South Natick, MA). SVD is useful to find the number of independent components in a set of spectra and to remove the high-frequency noise and the low-frequency random error. CD spectra in the 210–250-nm region (0.2-nm sampling interval) were placed in a rectangular matrix A of n columns, one column for each spectrum collected in the titration. The A matrix is decomposed by SVD into the product of three matrices: A = U * S * VT , where U and V are orthogonal matrices, and S is a diagonal matrix. The columns of U matrix contain the basis spectra, and those of the V matrix contain the denaturant dependence of each basis spectrum. Both U and V columns are arranged in terms of their decreasing order of the relative weight of information, as indicated by the magnitude of the singular values in S. The diagonal S matrix contains the singular values that quantify the relative importance of each vector in U and V. An important feature of SVD analysis is that the signal-to-noise ratio is very high in the earliest columns of U and V, and the random noise is mainly accumulated in the latest U and V columns. The wavelength averaged spectral changes induced by increasing denaturant concentrations are represented by the columns of matrix V. Therefore, the plot of the columns of V versus the denaturant concentration provides information about the observed transition. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding was analyzed by fitting baseline and transition region data to a two-state linear extrapolation model (20Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar) according to Equation 1, where ΔG unfolding is the free energy change of unfolding for a given denaturant concentration, ΔG H2O is the free energy change of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, and m is a slope term that quantitates the change in ΔG unfolding per unit concentration of denaturant, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and K unfolding is the equilibrium constant for unfolding. ΔGunfolding=ΔGH2O+m[urea]=-RTlnKunfolding(Eq. 1) The model expresses the signal as a function of denaturant concentration, shown in Equation 2, where yi is the observed signal, y N and y D are the native and denatured baseline intercepts, m N and m D are the native and denatured baseline slopes, [X] i is the denaturant concentration after the ith addition, ΔG H2O is the extrapolated free energy of unfolding in the absence of denaturant, m is the slope of a G unfolding versus [X] plot, R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. yi=yN+mN[X]i+(yD+mD[X]i)*exp[(-ΔGH2O-m[X]i)/RT]1+exp[(-ΔGH2O-m[X]i)/RT](Eq. 2) The [urea]0.5 is the denaturant concentration at the midpoint of the transition and, according to Equation 1, is calculated as shown in Equation 3. [urea]0.5=ΔGH2O/m(Eq. 3) Purification of mjSHMT and Molecular Mass Estimation— Purification was performed on 15-g portions of wet bacterial cell paste deriving from 2 liters of culture. A 20-fold purification of the enzyme with a yield of 10 mg per liter of culture was obtained. The purified enzyme exhibited a single band on SDS-PAGE when stained with Coomassie blue and, on analytical ultracentrifugation, sedimented as a single, sharp, and symmetrical peak (see below). mjSHMT, whose predicted subunit size based on the amino acid sequence is 48.2 kDa, eluted in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, from a calibrated size-exclusion chromatography column (Superose 12) with an elution volume corresponding to a protein of 98 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme is a dimer at neutral pH. Catalytic Properties of mjSHMT—The SHMT activity of the enzyme was assayed at 37 °C, using either H4MPT or H4PteGlu as pteridine substrate. Such a sub-optimal temperature was required by the use of methylene-H4MPT dehydrogenase from M. extorquens AM1 as the coupling enzyme in the assay. Activity, which was measured upon mixing 0.1 μm enzyme with 4 mml-serine and 50 μm of either pteridine substrates, could only be detected when using H4MPT. The dependence of the steady-state rate of the reaction on substrates concentration conformed to the Michaelis-Menten equation, with best fit values of kinetic parameters as summarized in Table I. The addition of 20 mm magnesium acetate to the reaction mixture did not increase activity, differently from that reported for the enzyme from M. marburgensis (4Hoyt J.C. Oren A. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Wolfe R.S. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 153-158Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The same experiment was repeated under anaerobic conditions, obtaining similar values for the kinetic parameters, and showing that, interestingly, the reaction is not negatively affected by oxygen.Table IKinetic parameters of the reactions catalysed by mjSHMTReactionKmkcatk cat/Kmmmmin-1min-1 mm-1SHMTL-serine0.8aApparent Km values calculated from experiments in which the concentration of one substrate was varied whereas the second substrate was fixed at high concentration.212265H4MPT0.1aApparent Km values calculated from experiments in which the concentration of one substrate was varied whereas the second substrate was fixed at high concentration.2122122H4PteGluN.D.bN.D., not determined.N.D.5.2cCalculated as reported in the text.Retroaldol cleavagedReactions were carried out at 60 °C.l-allo-Threonine1.3687528d,l-threo-3-Phenylserine95357637.6a Apparent Km values calculated from experiments in which the concentration of one substrate was varied whereas the second substrate was fixed at high concentration.b N.D., not determined.c Calculated as reported in the text.d Reactions were carried out at 60 °C. Open table in a new tab Activity could actually be measured also when using H4PteGlu, but only if the enzyme was present in the assay at a much higher concentration (14 μm). In this case, the dependence of the steady-state velocity on the pteridine substrate was linear on a range from 0 to 150 μm. Higher H4PteGlu concentrations could not be employed without incurring problems with the assay. Activity did not change significantly when measured under anaerobic conditions. The specificity constant with H4PteGlu could be calculated, because the observed linear relationship between substrate concentration and initial velocity is evidence that under the conditions of the assay Km » [S], and therefore the Michaelis-Menten equation can be reduced to v 0 = k cat/Km ·[E 0]·[S]. H4PteGlu is known to react spontaneously with formaldehyde (21Chen M.S. Schirch L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7979-7984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, there was a possibility that the SHMT reaction we observed with H4PteGlu was actually because of the retroaldol cleavage of serine, followed by the spontaneous condensation between the product formaldehyde and the folate to form 5,10-methylene-H4PteGlu. To check this hypothesis, we repeated the experiment under the same conditions but in the absence of H4PteGlu. No formaldehyde could be detected, confirming that the SHMT reaction involving H4PteGlu takes place on the enzyme. The actual binding of H4PteGlu to the enzyme was also demonstrated by the appearance of a typical 490-nm absorbing band, corresponding to a quinonoid intermediate (22Schirch L.V. Jenkins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3801-3806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), upon mixing 0.2 mm H4PteGlu with 230 μm enzyme and 70 mm glycine at 37 °C in 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2. Analogously, a quinonoid intermediate was visible after mixing 0.135 mm H4MPT with 14 μm enzyme and 70 mm glycine (data not shown). The enzyme was also capable of catalyzing the retroaldol cleavage of l-allo-threonine and threo-β-phenylserine to glycine and the corresponding aldehyde (Table I). Addition of 200 mm of either l- or d-alanine to the enzyme resulted in a transamination reaction, as indicated by the decrease of absorbance at 424 nm and the concomitant formation of a new absorption band with a maximum at 324 nm. The 498-nm absorbing band, corresponding to a quinonoid intermediate, which is observed with the E. coli enzyme (16Shostak K. Schirch V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8007-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), is absent in the reaction catalyzed by mjSHMT. The kinetics of both reactions, which were carried out at 60 °C, fitted well to the sum of two first-order processes. With d-alanine, the rapid phase exhibited a k = 0.42 min–1 and was responsible for about ¾ of the total absorbance change, whereas the slow phase had a k = 0.054 min–1. With l-alanine, the fast phase corresponded to a k = 0.092 min–1 and ⅓ of the total amplitude; the slow phase had a k = 0.001 min–1. Although eSHMT transaminates both alanine enantiomers with single first order kinetics, the reaction of d-alanine is also faster with this enzyme (k is 0.038 min–1 with d-alanine and 0.014 min–1 with l-alanine). Temperature Dependence of Enzyme Activity—The temperature dependence of the rate of retroaldol cleavage of l-allo-threonine was determined, using either eSHMT or mjSHMT as catalyst, over the range from 25 to 85 °C (Fig. 2A). The steady-state velocity of the reaction was measured both under virtually saturating conditions (25 mm substrate) and at about 4% of saturation (0.055 mm substrate). The reaction catalyzed by mjSHMT was found to have an optimal temperature 20–25 °C higher than that catalyzed by the E. coli enzyme. Saturation with the substrate had a stabilizing effect on the activity of both enzymes. Data were used in a global fit to the Arrhenius equation in which the activation energy (estimated to be equal to 70.00 ± 2.10 kJ/mol) was a shared parameter (Fig. 2B). Urea-induced Unfold"
https://openalex.org/W1985192583,"TSH activates its specific receptor in thyroid cells and induces cAMP, a robust stimulator of thyroid cell proliferation. Conversely, cAMP is a potent inhibitor of growth in mouse fibroblasts. To dissect the signals mediating cAMP-dependent growth, we have expressed in mouse fibroblasts the human thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) or a constitutively active mutant, under the control of the tetracyclin promoter. Both TSHR and cAMP levels were modulated by tetracyclin. In the presence of serum, activation of TSHR by TSH induced growth arrest. In the absence of serum, cells expressing TSHR stimulated with TSH, replicated their DNA, but underwent apoptosis. Co-expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulatory subunit type II (RIIβ) inhibited apoptosis and stimulated the growth of cells only in the presence of TSH. Expression of RIIβ-PKA, in the absence of TSHR, induced apoptosis, which was reversed by cAMP. Growth, stimulated by TSHR-RIIβ-PKA in mouse fibroblasts, was also dependent on Rap1 activity, indicating cAMP-dependent growth in thyroid cells. As for the molecular mechanism underlying these effects, we found that in normal fibroblasts, TSH induced AKT and ERK1/2 only in cells expressing TSHR and RII. Similarly, activation of TSHR increased cAMP levels greatly, but was unable to stimulate CREB phosphorylation and transcription of cAMP-induced genes in the absence of RII. These data provide a simple explanation for the anti-proliferative and proliferative effects of cAMP in different cell types and indicate that RII-PKAII complements TSHR action by stably propagating robust cAMP signals in cell compartments.

To dissect the signals involved in cAMP stimulation of growth, we have expressed the TSH receptor (TSHR) in mouse fibroblasts under the control of an inducible promoter. Note that a previous study reported the permanent expression of the receptor in mouse fibroblasts, stably transfected with wild-type TSHR and constitutively active mutants. Under these conditions, a strong selection was applied to the cells, and the phenotypes of the clones were not easily interpretable in terms of cAMP-dependent growth (17Du Villard J.A. Wicker R. Crespo P. Russo D. Filetti S. Gutkind J.S. Sarasin A. Suarez H.G. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4896-4905Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We report here that under conditional expression of TSHR, only the co-expression of RIIβ subunit of PKA and TSHR resulted in TSH-dependent growth. Both TSHR or RIIβ PKA expressed alone induced apoptosis or growth arrest. Their growth-stimulating activity was dependent on the ability not only to generate but to propagate cAMP signals to downstream nuclear substrates. Materials and Reagents—Unless otherwise specified, drugs and chemicals were obtained from Sigma, and cell culture supplies were purchased from standard suppliers, e.g. Falcon, Invitrogen, Hyclone. Cell Lines—Mouse fibroblasts NIH 3T3 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine (standard medium). The tTA-repressor-expressing clones were grown in standard medium containing puromycin (2.5 μg/ml), tetracyclin (1.0 μg/ml), and geneticin (G418) (200 μg/ml). The selection and tetracyclin were removed 48 h before starting the experimental procedures described below. Plasmids and Transfections—We obtained stable cell lines using the Tet-off repressor system consisting of the t-TA gene expression vector (a pUHD15.1-modified vector conferring puromycin resistance) and the CMV-tet-operator cloning vector pUHD10.3 (18Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4232) Google Scholar). Several NIH3T3 clones, expressing the t-TA gene, were isolated by Luc reporter activity under Tet-repressor control (NTC or control). The NTC clone was used to generate: 1) hTSHR-WT and 2) T632I-espressing cells (TSHR, T632I). TSHR constructs were obtained by subcloning the 2300-bp EcoRI fragment (19Porcellini A. Ciullo I. Pannain S. Fenzi G. Avvedimento E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1089-1093PubMed Google Scholar) into the pUHD10.3 vector. For each NTC line, we have generated permanent clones, which expressed the regulative subunit of the PKA type II β (RIIβ) by transfecting a plasmid encoding the human RIIβ cDNA (3.6-kb EcoRI fragment) under the control of the CMV promoter, carrying the geneticin resistance gene (G-418) (20Tortora G. Budillon A. Yokozaki H. Clair T. Pepe S. Merlo G. Rohlff C. Cho-Chung Y.S. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 753-759PubMed Google Scholar). For cAMP-dependent transcription assay each clone was transiently transfected in triplicte samples by the calcium phosphate procedure (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.62Google Scholar) with 5 μg of pRSV-LacZ and 5 μg of pCRE-CAT (22Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 48 h (0.5% fetal bovine serum). Control cells were stimulated with forskolin (25 μm) for 4 h. The cells were harvested and total protein extracted (see below). CAT enzymatic assay was performed as described (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.62Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was normalized for β-galactosidase assay. Total RNA Extraction and Northen Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from 107 cells grown in a 150-mm dish by the guanidium isothiocyanate procedure; 20 μg of each RNA sample was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using standard capillary techniques. The filter was then hybridized with specific radioactive probes overnight at 65 °C in Church Buffer (0.5 m Na2PO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA). Radioactivity was revealed by autoradiography using preflashed films. The following probes were used: a 0.9-kb DNA fragment corresponding to hTSHR cDNA region coding for codons 58–381; and the fulllength rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. All probes were labeled with [32P]dGTP by nick translation. Quantitative analysis of the hTSHR mRNA amount was performed by densitometry using the NIH Image software for Apple Macintosh. cAMP Assays—For each experimental point 2 × 105 cells of each clone were seeded in a 6-well tissue culture tray. After 24 h the cells were serum-starved for 18 h; then serum-free medium with 0.5 mm IBMX and different TSH concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, and 10 mU/ml) were added for 40 min. Cells were lysed with cold ethanol containing 1% 1 m HCl and incubated overnight at +4 °C. The medium was collected, neutralized, lyophilized, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 1 mM EDTA and used for cAMP assay (Amersham Biosciences, cyclic AMP 3H assay system). Each experiment was repeated three times in triplicate samples. Growth Analysis—Proliferation was analyzed under different conditions: normal medium or low serum (0.5%) with and without TSH 10 mU/ml. For each experiment 104 cells were seeded in a 12-well tissue culture tray; cells were collected and counted after 24 h or 3, 6, 9, or 15 days. The MTT colorimetric assay for proliferation was performed in a 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture tray for each time point: 2500 cells for each clone were seeded in eight replicas for each experimental point; 6 h after plating the standard medium was removed, and 100 μl of culture medium without serum were applied. The determinations were carried out every 24 h as follow: 0.01 ml of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) stock (5 mg/ml) was added to each well. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C the medium was removed and 0.1 ml of isopropyl alcohol/0.04 n HCl was added. The absorbance was measured after 1 h on an ELISA plate reader. We have used a Dynatech MR580 reader with a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. [3H]thymidine incorporation assays were carried out as follows. 5000 cells were seeded in a 96-well flat-bottomed tissue culture tray. After 72 h of growth in the absence of tetracyclin serum was removed for 18 h (0.5% fetal bovine serum). The following day the low serum medium was replaced by standard medium, and [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi) and TSH 10 mU/ml (as required) were added. Cells were collected 6, 12, and 18 h after stimulation. DNA was extracted with the Cell Harvester; radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation. All experiments were repeated three times in triplicate. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by FACS. 106 cells were plated in 100-mm dishes; 8 h after seeding, cells were subject to different treatments. After 48 h, 2.5–3 × 106 cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS. Ethanol fixation was carried out by adding 10 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol. After 3 h, fixed cells were washed and stained for 30 min at room temperature in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNaseA, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide. Fluorescence was determined by FACS and analyzed by Cell Fit Cell-Cycle Analysis Version 2. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—107 cells were lysed in TBS, 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.4 mm Na3VO4) and incubated on ice for 20 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g, the protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). 100 μg of protein were added to an equal volume of 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, 2% mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, separated on 7% SDS-PAGE, and electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Germany). After transferring, Ponceau staining was used to confirm equal protein loading. The membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C in PBS/2.5% nonfat dry milk containing 1 μg/ml of specific antibody. The membranes were washed twice with PBS and reincubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instruction (ECL detection system; Amersham Biosciences). Anti-rat PCREB antibodies (23Ginty D.D.

Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Specific anti-RIIβ antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic RIIβ peptide (peptide 31–57 from the AUG of the rat sequence), cross-linked to soybean trypsin inhibitor (24Paolillo M.

TUNEL Assay—104 cells were grown on slides (ordinary glass slides washed in ethanol and soaked in 0.01% poly-l-lysine). After treatment, slides were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/1× PBS, 10 min, at room temperature and washed one time in PBS + 50 mm glycine, 10 min at room temperature, and three times for 5 min in PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, 1× PBS for 10 min, washed 3 × 5 min in PBS, and equilibrated with 200 μl of 1× TdT buffer + 1 mm cobalt chloride (under a 60 × 24 mm coverslip), for 5 min. The TUNEL reaction was carried out using the In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science). Apoptotic rate was determined by FACS analysis on propidium iodide-stained cells. For FACS analysis, after 48 of tet starvation, 106 cells for each clone were plated in 100-mm dishes and starved from serum for 18 h. Terminal transferase reaction (Roche Applied Science) and staining with antiBRDU-FITC (BD Pharmingen) was performed on paraformaldheyde/ethanol-fixed cells, according to the manufacturer's instructions. After TUNEL reaction, cells were washed and stained for 30 min at room temperature in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 mg/ml DNase-free RNaseA, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide. Fluorescence was determined by FACS and analyzed by Cell Quest software. Recombinant Adenovirus Expressing the Dominant-negative RAP-1b Variant—RAP-1b dominant-negative mutant plasmid was previously described (13Iacovelli L. Capobianco L. Salvatore L. Sallese M. D'Ancona G.M. De Blasi A. Mol Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 924-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cDNA insert was subcloned into the multiple cloning site of the shuttle plasmid (pAd-CMV-TRK) by standard cloning procedures. The purified shuttle plasmid was digested with the restriction enzymes PmeI to obtain the “rescue” fragment. The fragment was then purified on agarose gel, and 2 μg of purified rescue fragment was used for homologous recombination. The adenoviral plasmid pAdEasy-1 (25He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar) was then mixed with the rescue fragment, and the DNA mixture was transformed into the BJ5183 bacterial strain and incubated overnight. Colonies were screened by digesting the DNA with BglII and performing a Southern blot to confirm the presence of the cDNA insert. The DNA with the proper orientation was transformed into the DH5α bacterial strain. The recombinant construct, purified using Qiagen Maxi preparation kit, was digested overnight with PacI and transfected into 293 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). Adenoviral plaques were twice purified by infecting 293 cells in agar. Virus was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation, dialyzed and titrated by plaque assay. Conditional Expression of Wild-type and Mutated TSH Receptor in Mouse Fibroblasts—TSH receptor was cloned under the control of the inducible tetracyclin promoter. In the configuration we have used, Tet-off (see “Experimental Procedures”), the tetracyclin repressor (tTA), in the presence of the tetracyclin, inhibits the transcription of the downstream gene. Removal of the drug from the medium results in the activation of transcription. We transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts with the tTA repressor, isolated several clones, and re-transfected them with the Tet-TSHReceptor (TSHR) construct. Several clones were isolated and screened for inhibition of expression of TSHR in the presence of tetracyclin (tet). Fig. 1 shows the levels of TSHR mRNA in two clones, transfected with the wild-type TSHR and the constitutively active mutant T632I, which contains a mutated residue in position 632 (isoleucine mutated to threonine). TSHR mRNA levels were critically dependent on the time and the concentration of tet added to the medium. Maximal expression was observed 12–24 h after removal of the drug and it remained constant for 15 days of continuous culture in the absence of the drug (Fig. 1). Down-regulation of TSHR mRNA by tet was maximal after 48–72 h of continuous drug exposure. To test if TSHR was functionally coupled to Gs, we determined the levels of intracellular cAMP. In cells, expressing the TSHR (i.e. in the absence of tet), basal cAMP levels were unchanged, while TSH induced a rapid (30Feliciello A. Giuliano P. Porcellini A. Garbi C. Obici S. Mele E. Angotti E.

We screened for clones displaying the same range of cAMP response found in thyroid cells (FRTL-5, see Ref. 26Porcellini A. Ruggiano G. Pannain S. Ciullo I. Amabile G. Fenzi G. Avvedimento E.V. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). TSH induction of cAMP was abolished by tet treatment (Fig. 2, panel c). In cells transfected with the constitutively active receptor T632I, basal cAMP levels were increased when the receptor was expressed (i.e. when tet was removed from the medium) (Fig. 2, panel d). In these cells, TSH further increased cAMP levels (Fig. 2, panels c and d) (19Porcellini A. Ciullo I. Pannain S. Fenzi G. Avvedimento E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1089-1093PubMed Google Scholar). These data validate our experimental model, since cAMP levels mirror the expression of both the TSHR and T632I receptors. Thus, cAMP basal levels were higher in cells expressing T632I than in cells expressing TSHR in the absence of TSH. This indicates that the wild-type receptor was not expressed at levels that induced its activity in the absence of TSH. Expression of TSH Receptor Inhibits DNA Synthesis and Growth of Mouse Fibroblasts—It is known that cAMP inhibits the growth of mouse fibroblasts (27Stork P.J. Schmitt J.M.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3237-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). We asked whether the regulated production of cAMP by Gs-coupled TSHR could modulate the growth of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. To this end, we have used the wild-type receptor, which activates cAMP production only when exogenous TSH is present, or a mutant version of the receptor, T632I, which constitutively activates adenylyl cyclase in the absence TSH (26Porcellini A. Ruggiano G. Pannain S. Ciullo I. Amabile G. Fenzi G. Avvedimento E.V. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 781-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Porcellini A. Ciullo I. Pannain S. Fenzi G. Avvedimento E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1089-1093PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of fibroblasts was measured under different conditions (in the absence or presence of tet, serum, or TSH). A general scheme illustrating the temporal order of the various assays is shown in Fig. 3. Under each experimental condition indicated in Fig. 3, we have monitored the expression of TSHR and cAMP levels, following the treatment of the cell with 1 mU TSH for 40 min, to ascertain that the observed effects were not caused by variations in TSHR levels or activity (data not shown). Tetracyclin, tet, at the concentrations used (1.0 μg/ml) did not alter the growth of control (cells expressing the tTA-repressor only) and TSHR-expressing fibroblasts (Fig. 4, panels a and b). Control cells displayed a doubling time of ∼28.4 h. When tet was removed from the medium, the growth of TSHR expressing cells was slightly reduced (doubling time = 29.3 h). Continuous exposure of these cells to TSH (10 mU/ml) inhibited robustly cell growth (Fig. 4, panel b). The doubling time was 42 h, 45% longer than the control. This inhibition was dependent on the expression of TSHR, because it was abolished by tet and was strictly dependent on TSH in cell lines expressing TSHR (Fig. 4, panels a and b). In cells transfected with T632I, the expression of the active receptor, following removal of tet from the medium, inhibited cell growth in the absence of TSH (Fig. 4, panel c). These data were confirmed by thymidine incorporation curves (Fig. 4, panels d–f) and by MTT assay (data not shown). FACS analysis confirmed that inhibition by TSH was caused by delayed S phase entry (Fig. 5C). The data shown in Figs. 2 and 4 indicate that in our experimental settings, the biological effects on cAMP and DNA synthesis were dependent on TSH. Note that in the absence of TSH, the growth and cAMP levels were similar between TSHR transfected and control cell.Fig. 4TSH receptor expression inhibits the growth of mouse fibroblasts. The upper panel shows the growth profile of control fibroblasts (tTA-repressor-expressing clone) and cells expressing wild-type receptor or T632I, respectively. The plots indicate the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments in triplicate samples. The lower panel shows thymidine incorporation curves of the same cell lines indicated in A. Briefly, after 72 h of growth in the absence of tetracyclin, serum was removed (0.5%) for 18 h. At time 0, serum and [3H]thymidine were added. DNA was extracted by Cell Harvester, and radioactivity was determined. All these experiments were repeated three times in triplicate samples. At the concentrations used (1.0 μg/ml), tetracyclin did not affect thymidine incorporation in control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 5Co-expression of TSHR and PKA, regulatory subunit RIIβ, stimulates the growth of mouse fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2044213109,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and glucocorticoid signaling pathways interact both positively and negatively in regulating a variety of physiological and pathologic processes. We previously reported that liganded glucocorticoid receptor (GR) repressed TGF-beta induction of human plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene transcription by directly targeting the transcriptional activation function of Smad3. To identify the domain(s) in the glucocorticoid receptor involved in this repression, we have examined the ability of various GR truncation, deletion, and substitution mutants to repress TGF-beta transactivation in Hep3B human hepatoma cells that lack functional endogenous GR. Partial deletions in the ligand-binding domain (LBD), including the tau2 and tauc regions, greatly reduced or eliminated GR repression, whereas deletion of the N-terminal AF1 (tau1) domain and substitution mutations in the DNA-binding domain had little or no effect. Liganded androgen receptor repressed TGF-beta transactivation, whereas mineralocorticoid receptor did not, and studies with rat GR-mineralocorticoid receptor chimeras confirmed that the GR C-terminal domains were required for repression. RU486, a strong antagonist of transactivation by GR, partially reversed repression by wild type GR. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in Hep3B cells indicated that physical interaction between GR and Smad3 is necessary but not sufficient for repression. Physical interaction required activation of Smad3 by TGF-beta but not dexamethasone binding to GR. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays demonstrated that several regions of the LBD could mediate GR-Smad3 physical interaction. We conclude that the LBD of GR, but not the DNA-binding domain or the N-terminal activation domain, is required for GR-mediated transrepression of TGF-beta transactivation."

These transcriptional responses appear to depend on three molecular features: organization of the Ets-1/Pit-1 composite element, physical interaction of these two factors via the Pit-1 homeodomain (amino acids 199–291) and the Ets-1 regulatory III domain (amino acids 190–257), and assembly of their transcriptional activation domains (TADs). Here we show that the organization of the Ets-1/Pit-1 composite element tolerates significant flexibility with regard to Ras stimulation and synergy. Specifically, the putative monomeric Pit-1 binding site can be substituted with bona fide binding sites for either a Pit-1 monomer or dimer, and these sites tolerated a separation of 28 bp. Additionally, we show that the physical interaction of Ets-1 and Pit-1 is not required for Ras responsiveness or synergy because block mutations of the Pit-1 interaction surface in Ets-1, which reduced Ets-1/Pit-1 binding in vitro, did not significantly affect Ets-1 stimulation of Ras responsiveness or synergy. We also show differential use of distinct TAD subtypes and Pit-1 TAD subregions to mediate either synergy or Ras responsiveness. Specifically, TADs from Gal4, VP16, or Ets-2 regulatory III domain linked to Ets-1 DNA binding domain constructs restored synergy to these TAD/Ets-1 DNA binding domain fusions. Conversely, deletion of the defined Pit-1 TAD (amino acids 2–80) retained synergy, but not Ras responsiveness. Consequently, we further defined the Pit-1 amino-terminal TAD into region 1 (R1, amino acids 2–45) and region 2 (R2, amino acids 46–80). R1 appears to regulate basal and synergistic responses, whereas the Ras response was mapped to R2. In summary, Ras responsiveness and Pit-1/Ets-1 synergy are mediated through the assembly of distinct TADs at a flexible composite element, indicating that different mechanisms underlie these two transcriptional responses and that the Pit-1 R2 subregion represents a novel, tissue-specific Ras-responsive TAD.

Pit-1/GHF-1 is a POU homeodomain transcription factor specifically expressed in the anterior pituitary which is responsible for determining the somatotroph, lactotroph, and thyrotroph lineages, as well as the regulated expression of their respective hormones: growth hormone, prolactin, and thyroid-stimulating hormone. Combinatorial interactions between Pit-1 and other trans-acting factors at composite or adjacent response elements have been shown to allow Pit-1 to serve as a cell-specific integrator of signaling pathways.

In precisely this manner, an Ets/Pit-1 combination, acting via the Ets binding site (EBS)/footprint IV (FPIV) composite element spanning positions –217 to –190, is critical for both basal lactotroph-specific expression of the rPRL gene and for the targeting of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway to the prolactin promoter (3Bradford A. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that both Ets-1 and Pit-1 factors are required for the synergistic activation and Ras responsiveness. For example, transient transfection of pituitary-derived GH4T2 somatolactotrope cells with a dominant-negative Ets factor encoding only the Ets DNA binding domain (DBD), or with Pit-1β (an alternatively spliced isoform that functions as a dominant-negative effector in pituitary cells), results in diminished activity of the rPRL promoter in an effector-dependent manner (3Bradford A. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similarly, transient transfection of rPRL promoter constructs containing site-specific mutations of either the EBS or FPIV sites within the composite element results in a loss of Ras responsiveness (10Bradford A.P. Conrad K.E. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2849-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 11Bradford A. Conrad K. Tran P. Ostrowski M.

In non-pituitary HeLa cells, it has been shown that although individual Ets-1 or Pit-1 effectors strongly activate the rPRL promoter, the combination results in a response that is 6-fold greater than the sum of the individual responses (i.e. 6-fold synergy) (3Bradford A. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, Ets-1 and Pit-1 have been shown to bind physically to each other in dilute solution and in the absence of DNA by utilizing the Ets-1 regulatory III (RIII) transcriptional activation domain (TAD) and Pit-1 homeodomain (3Bradford A. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Augustijn K.D. Duval D.L. Wechselberger R. Kaptein R.

Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3100-3106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Finally, Thr-82 of chicken p68 c-Ets-1 was identified as a MAP kinase phosphorylation site, and site-specific mutation of Thr-82 to alanine resulted in loss of the Ets-1-mediated enhancement of the Ras response (14Wasylyk C. Bradford A. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 899-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results support a two-step model of Ets-1/Pit-1 activation of the rPRL promoter in which binding of Ets-1/Pit-1 to the composite element and to each other regulates basal promoter activity, and Ras activation occurs in part as a response to phosphorylation of Ets-1 at Thr-82. Structure-function analysis of p68 Ets-1 has highlighted a number of features. Specifically, the TAD is composed of three regulatory domains, RI–RIII. RI and RIII function as positive TADs, whereas RII functions as a domain that negatively regulates the function of RI and positively regulates RIII. Overlapping the RII TAD is the pointed domain which contains the MAP kinase phosphorylation site, Thr-82. The latter is highly conserved in the Ets subfamily, comprising Ets-1, Ets-2, and pointed P1 and P2 (15Graves B. Petersen J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the Ets subfamily, RI and RIII are unique to either Ets-1 or Ets-2. Amino acids 180–300 within RIII have only 6% similarity between Ets-1 and Ets-2 compared with ∼90% similarity for the DBD and 66% conservation for RII. Finally, the ETS DBD, located near the carboxyl terminus of Ets-1, is flanked by two domains that inhibit DNA binding, In1 and In2. The DBD is a highly conserved 84–90-amino acid domain referred to as the ETS domain (16Donaldson L. Petersen J. Graves B. McIntosh L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 17Donaldson L. Petersen J. Graves B. McIntosh L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13509-13516Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The ETS domain, which serves to define the family, utilizes a winged helix-turn-helix structural motif to bind to Ets binding sites. The core sequence of the Ets binding sites consists of the sequence 5′-GGA(A/T)-3′. In addition, flanking DNA sequences on either side of this core binding element may contribute to specific Ets factor binding, such that the actual binding site may consist of ∼9 bp (15Graves B. Petersen J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The composite EBS/FPIV binding site located at –217 to –190 consists of a core GGAA site on the antisense strand separated by 8 bp from the core binding site for Pit-1 (see Fig. 1). Typically, monomeric Ets factors bind to DNA weakly and require a vicinally bound factor to stabilize Ets factor-DNA interactions (18Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Consequently, Ets factors and their partners are often recruited to bipartite binding sites on DNA, forming ternary complexes and resulting in synergistic transcriptional responses. The spacing and orientation of these bipartite binding sites do not appear to be critical determinants for the binding of these ternary complexes. For example, ternary complexes of SRF and the Ets factors Elk-1 and SAP-1 can occur even when the respective binding sites are inverted with respect to each other or moved apart over two helical turns of DNA (19Treisman R. Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Rather, DNA binding appears to be modulated by the flanking autoinhibitory sequences, In1 and In2, which can be regulated by specific protein partnerships and further modulated by protein phosphorylation (15Graves B. Petersen J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 20Hill C.

Indeed, the most important mechanism for achieving target gene specificity is cofactor-induced alterations of Ets protein interactions. Usually, Ets proteins interact with partners through the EtsDBD (15Graves B. Petersen J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Janknecht R. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1155: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 22Dittmer J. Nordheim A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: F1-F11PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wasylyk B. Nordheim A. Papavassiliou A. Transcription Factors in Eukaryotes. Landes Bioscience Publishing, Georgetown, TX1997: 251-284Google Scholar). However, core-binding factor and Pit-1 interact with Ets-1 via domains distinct from the DBD, with core-binding factor binding to the In1 autoinhibitory domain and Pit-1 binding to the RIII TAD (3Bradford A. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Kim W.-Y. Sieweke M. Ogawa E. Wee H.-J. Englmeier U. Graf T. Ito Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Further analysis has refined the Pit-1 interaction face of Ets-1 to a 67-amino acid subdomain (amino acids 190–257) within this Ets-1 isoform-specific region (3Bradford A. Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 12Augustijn K.D. Duval D.L. Wechselberger R. Kaptein R. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Van der Vliet P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12657-12662Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Conversely, POU homeodomain transcription factors utilize a bipartite DBD that can partially encircle the DNA. The DNA element thus dictates the configurations of subdomains and subsequent recruitment of specific coregulators to control transcription (25Phillips K. Luisi B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 1023-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Specifically, the ability of Pit-1 to bind to DNA as either a monomer or a dimer dictates the domains that it uses to synergize with heterologous transcription factors (26Holloway J. Szeto D. Scully K. Glass C. Rosenfeld M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1992-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Similarly, the spacing of the contact points for the POU-specific domain and POU homeodomain is sufficient to transform Pit-1 from a trans-activating factor to a repressor (27Scully K.M. Jacobson E. Jepsen K. Lunyak V. Viadiu H. Carriere C. Rose D.W. Hooshmand F. Aggarwal A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 2000; 290: 1127-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in DNA binding, the homeodomain of Pit-1 is necessary and sufficient for physical interaction with Ets-1. Although it is unclear what precise role the physical interaction of Ets-1/Pit-1 plays in the synergistic activation of the rPRL promoter, it is intriguing to note that the β-domain of the Pit-1β isoform also interacts with this Ets-1-specific region (13Bradford A.P. Brodsky K.S. Diamond S.E. Kuhn L.C. Liu Y. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3100-3106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study we examined the role played by spacing and composition of the combinatorial EBS/FPIV element or the physical interaction of Ets and Pit-1 in Ras responsiveness and synergistic activation of the rPRL promoter. We show that the Ets-1/Pit-1 composite element represents a highly flexible site through which the assembly of select transcriptional activation domains stimulates synergistic activation and Ras responsiveness of the rPRL promoter. Moreover, we show that the Ets-1/Pit-1 synergism and Ras responses require different subdomains of the Pit-1 TAD, indicating that these two responses are mediated by distinct transcription control mechanisms. Taken together, these results provide novel insights into molecular mechanisms that specify transcription synergy and oncogenic Ras transcription responses. pA3–425PRL-Luc containing the proximal 425 bp of 5′-flanking sequence from the rPRL promoter in the pA3Luc reporter has been described previously (28Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations mEBS and mFPIV have been previously described (11Bradford A. Conrad K. Tran P. Ostrowski M. Gutierrez-Hartmann A.

Mutations of pA3–425PRL-Luc including monomer, dimer, 12 bp, 16 bp, and 24 bp were generated by overlap extension PCR amplification from –425PRLpGEM7 using mutant internal primers and SP6 and T7 primers with dual rounds of amplification. The 12-bp and 16-bp insertions incorporate an SalI site into the space between the EBS and FPIV Pit-1 binding site. The 24-bp insertion incorporates SalI, SpeI, and NheI sites. The mutant primers are as follows: monomer S, GCA TTA AAA AAT GCA TAT CCT TCC; monomer AS, GAT ATG CAT TTT TTA ATG CAA AAG G; dimer S, CTT TTG ATG TAT ATA CAT AAA ATC C; dimer AS, GAT TTT ATG TAT ATA CAT CAA AAG G; 12-bp S, TCC TTT TGT CGA CTG TAA TTA ATC AAA ATC C; 12-bp AS, ACA GTC GAC AAA AGG AAA TGA GAG A; 16-bp S, TGT CGA CGT CCT GTA ATT AAT CAA AAT CC; 16-bp AS, TAC AGG ACG TCG ACA AAA GGA AAT GAG AGA; 24-bp S, TCG ACA CTA GTG CTA GCT GTA ATT AAT CAA AAT CC; 24-bp AS, CTA GCA CTA GTG TCG ACA AAA GGA AAT GAG AGA. Mutant promoter 28 bp was generated by digesting the 24-bp insertion construct with SpeI, filling in the overhangs by Klenow treatment, and religating the vector. Mutant promoter 32 bp was generated by digesting 28 bp with SalI, filling in the overhangs by Klenow treatment, and religating the vector. Sequences were verified by sequencing. Plasmid pSG5c-Ets-1 and Ets-2 encode the p68 chicken Ets-1 and chicken Ets-2, respectively, under control of the SV40 early promoter. These constructs as well as the amino-terminal deletions of Ets-1, pSG5-Ets-1Δ5–4 and Δ5–6, n70 Ets-1DBD (EtsDBD), VP16TAD-n70Ets-1DBD (VP16EtsDBD), VP16Ets280–440, and VP16Ets330–440 (29Schneikert J.

These mutations were made utilizing overlap extension PCR to amplify mutated fragments of Ets-1 from nucleotides 401–1054.

Gal4ADΔ5–4 and Δ5–6 were constructed by subcloning the Gal4AD from pACT2 into pBluescript utilizing HindIII and XhoI restriction sites. The Gal4AD was then isolated from pBluescript by a partial digest with EcoRI and complete digest with XhoI and ligated into either pSG5 Δ5–4 or Δ5–6 that had also been partially digested with EcoRI and completely digested with XhoI. The mutant Ets-1/2 chimera was generated using overlap extension PCR to replace amino acids 185–257 of Ets-1 with amino acids 178–251 of c-Ets-2. The resulting PCR product was digested at internal BglII and AflIII restriction sites and ligated into a pSG5 Ets-1 vector in which the BglII site in the multiple cloning site was destroyed. This vector was partially digested with AflIII and completely digested with BglII.

Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad assay (Bio-Rad). Bound protein was analyzed for intactness and mass by SDS-PAGE in parallel with a known amount of bovine serum albumin and Gelcode Blue or Coomassie Blue staining. In Vitro Binding Assays— 35S-Labeled proteins were synthesized and labeled with [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation reticulocyte lysate system with T7 polymerase and supercoiled plasmids pSG5-Ets-1, BPV-1, BPV-2, BPV-3, Ets-2, Ets-1/2, VP16EtsDBD, and Gal4ADΔ5–6 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Approximately equal amounts (5 μg) of GST fusion proteins bound to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads were suspended in a total volume of 0.5 ml of binding buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1× Complete protease inhibitors). Ethidium bromide was added to a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to eliminate binding of any contaminating DNA (31Lai J. Herr W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6958-6962Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotator. 35S-Labeled proteins (5 μl of a 50-μl synthesis reaction) were added to the GST fusion samples and incubated on a rotator at room temperature for 1 h. The Sepharose beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 2,500 × g for 5 min. Aliquots of the supernatant were reserved to assess input, and the beads were washed four times with 1 ml of binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The 35S-labeled proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in SDS-sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Bands were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software. HeLa and GH4T2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The medium was changed 4–16 h prior to transfection. Electroporation—Cells were harvested with 1× PBS with 3 mm EDTA and resuspended in culture medium. Aliquots of ∼2–4 × 106 cells in 200 μl of medium were added to plasmid DNA as described in the figure legends and transfected by electroporation at 220 V and 500 microfarads using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with 4-mm gap cuvettes. Following transfection, cells were plated on 60-mm tissue culture plates in culture medium and incubated for 24 h. All electroporations included 0.3 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase (Clontech) as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Total DNA was kept constant, and nonspecific effects of viral promoters were controlled for by transfecting appropriate control vectors. Approximately 24 h following the electroporation, the cells were harvested, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured. The transfected cells were harvested in PBS containing 3 mm EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles in 100 μl of 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8 with 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and aliquots of the supernatant were used in subsequent assays. Samples were assayed in duplicate for luciferase activity as described previously (28Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286PubMed Google Scholar) using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratories). β-Galactosidase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as described (28Conrad K.E. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1279-1286PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid-mediated Transfection—HeLa cells were"
https://openalex.org/W2054814766,"The complexity of mammalian origins of DNA replication has prevented, so far, the <i>in vitro</i> studies of the modalities of initiator protein binding and origin selection. We approached this problem by utilizing the human lamin B2 origin, wherein the precise start sites of replication initiation have been identified and known to be bound <i>in vivo</i> by the origin recognition complex (ORC). In order to analyze the <i>in vitro</i> interactions occurring at this origin, we have compared the DNA binding requirements and patterns of the human recombinant Orc4 with those of preparations of HeLa nuclear proteins containing the ORC complex. Here we show that both HsOrc4 alone and HeLa nuclear proteins recognize multiple sites within a 241-bp DNA sequence encompassing the lamin B2 origin. The DNA binding activity of HeLa cells requires the presence of ORC and can be reproduced in the absence of all the other proteins known to be recruited to origins by ORC. Both HsOrc4 alone and HeLa nuclear proteins exhibit cooperative and ATP-independent binding. This binding covers nucleotides 3853–3953 and then spreads outward. Because this region contains the start sites of DNA synthesis as well as the area protected <i>in vivo</i> and preserves protein binding capacity <i>in vitro</i> after removal of a fraction of the protected region, we suggest that it could contain the primary binding site. Thus the <i>in vitro</i> approach points to the sequence requirements for ORC binding as a key element for origin recognition."

No patterns were noticed that would indicate unique interactions between individual amino acids and individual –10 region bases. Instead, certain amino acid substitutions led to increased holoenzyme binding to DNA, implying that the wild type interactions are associated with an inhibitory component. These inhibitory interactions were stronger on DNA containing non-consensus sequences, like those of typical promoters. In addition, the DNA segment downstream from the –10 element was also inhibitory to binding when in duplex form but stimulated binding when in single strand form.

Escherichia coli gene transcription is accomplished by multisubunit RNA polymerase holoenzymes, with the σ70 form being most common. σ70 promoters typically contain two moderately conserved sequence elements separated by an optimal spacer length of 17 bp (1Hawley D.K. McClure W.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2237-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar, 2Harley C.B. Reynolds R.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 2343-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring promoters diverge from the consensus sequences to varying degrees, and these variations are required to obtain physiologically appropriate transcription rates. Other nearby DNA sequences also contribute to promoter activity (3Keilty S. Rosenberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6389-6395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ross W. Gosink K.K. Salomon J. Igarashi K. Zou C. Ishihama A. Severinov K. Gourse R.L. Science. 1993; 262: 1407-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The role of the –10 element is complex as it is recognized initially as duplex DNA and continues to function after the DNA is opened. The dominant function is associated with the non-template strand (5Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and particularly with the –12 and –11 fork junction nucleotides at the boundary between duplex and non-template single strand DNA (6Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The structure of holoenzyme bound to fork junction DNA (a duplex with a single strand tail from –11 to –7) is available (7Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Protein:DNA contacts are not visible, but it is clear that certain amino acids in region 2 of σ70 are close enough to the non-template single strand to make contact. There is no structure with –10 duplex DNA, so information about –10 duplex recognition comes solely from biochemical studies. In addition to marking promoters for recognition, the –10 element contributes to the rate of open complex formation, and this is known to proceed through binding and isomerization steps (8Stefano J.E. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10423-10430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The open complex pathway includes several intermediates in which the conformational state of the DNA and polymerase varies (10Buckle M. Pemberton I.K. Jacquet M.A. Buc H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11deHaseth P.L. Zupancic M.L. Record Jr., M.T. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3019-3025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Roe J.H. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The final functional state is characterized by the resistance of the isomerized holoenzyme to the polyanionic inhibitor heparin (13Zillig W. Zechel K. Rabussay D. Schachner M. Sethi V.S. Palm P. Heil A. Seifert W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1971; 35: 47-58Crossref Google Scholar). This isomerization of the enzyme can be measured independently of the opening of the DNA by using fork junction probes in which the DNA is premelted (14Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9020-9025Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Such studies have indicated that the –10 region consensus bases have a critical role in enzyme isomerization (15Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9020-9025Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The bases also play a role in duplex recognition but have a lesser influence on binding single strand DNA, where interactions with the backbone appear to be more important (16Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). There have been systematic binding studies changing either the bases in the –10 region or the amino acids in the σ region 2 that may recognize them (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Tomsic M. Tsujikawa L. Panaghie G. Wang Y. Azok J. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31891-31896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In general, these and prior genetic experiments suggested the importance of a collection of clustered amino acids, many of which are aromatic (19Juang Y.L. Helmann J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1470-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and basic residues. The various studies are in substantial, but not full, agreement. This may be due to using different promoter contexts (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Tomsic M. Tsujikawa L. Panaghie G. Wang Y. Azok J. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31891-31896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A detailed nucleotide:amino acid recognition pattern has not yet emerged from these studies, although individual interactions have been proposed both in terms of structure and in terms of function. To extend our knowledge of these interactions, we have combined the study of mutant proteins with the study of mutant –10 region DNA. Duplex and single strand DNA binding and enzyme isomerization were each assayed using combinations of mutant proteins and mutant promoters. The results do not support a model in which extensive unique favorable interactions are made by pairs of amino acids and nucleotide bases. They reveal an unexpected phenomenon; certain amino acids and DNA downstream from the –10 element are designed to contribute to inhibition of binding or isomerization. These unfavorable interactions can be stronger with non-consensus –10 elements, and this may contribute to setting physiologically appropriate transcription rates. Proteins and DNA—The plasmid pQE30-rpoD was overexpressed, and σ70 and mutants were purified as described (31Wilson C. Dombroski A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 60-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Numerous clones had bands that migrated to lower positions on protein gels and were discarded. The DNA from candidates that passed this mobility screen was sequenced, and if the DNA contained the correct mutation, the protein was expressed and purified, and the mobility was rechecked. The E. coli RNA polymerase core is a commercial product from Epicenter Technologies. Oligonucleotides and probes were gel-purified and prepared as described (6Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11655-11660Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bottom strand of each probe was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The 40-μl mixture, containing 4 pmol of kinased DNA and 6 pmol of complementary strand in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5/50 mm NaCl, was annealed by rapid heating to 95 °C and slow cooling to room temperature in a PCR thermocycler (MJ Research). The resulting annealed probes were diluted in Tris-EDTA buffer containing 50 mm NaCl to the desired concentration. Proper annealing was monitored by electrophoresis. Plasmid pTH8-UV5 was constructed by inserting a 300-bp fragment containing the lac UV5 promoter into pTH8 (32Meiklejohn A.L. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 661-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) through unique restriction sites of BamHI and HindIII. Changing pTH8-UV5 by the Strategene site-directed mutagenesis kit created the point mutation –11C in the UV5 promoter. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Mobility shift assays with and without heparin were as described (15Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9020-9025Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 nm core was mixed with 50 nm σ70 in a 10-μl reaction mixture with 1× buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3.25% glycerol) with 6 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), and 1 nm annealed probe, and then incubated for 20 min on ice. For heparin challenge experiments, 0.25 μl of 2 mg/ml heparin was added into samples for an additional 5 min. Samples were run on 5% PAGE with 1× TBE buffer, packed in ice. All experimental results were averages from at least two different experiments. In Vitro Transcription—Transcription was as follows: 20 nm core and 50 nm σ70 were incubated with buffer A (described above) and 2.5 nm pTH8-UV5 for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were further incubated with an NTP mix consisting of 0.5 mm ATP, GTP, and UTP for 5 min at 37 °C. 1 μl of a CTP mix (1 mm CTP, 0.2 μCi/μl α-[32P]CTP, and 100 μg/ml heparin) was added for 20 min at 37 °C. Sample volumes were doubled with urea dye mix, heated 90 °C for 5 min, and run on a 6% PAGE with urea in 1× TBE. Effects of DNA Downstream from –10 on Holoenzyme Binding—Prior studies using a variety of promoter sequences and probes have indicated that the DNA downstream from –10 has a role in open complex formation (14Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This region has the potential to interact with subunits within the polymerase core (20Naryshkin N. Revyakin A. Kim Y. Mekler V. Ebright R.H. Cell. 2000; 101: 601-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). To consolidate and extend the information on this region, we conducted binding studies using the homologous series of probes shown in Fig. 1. These contain the downstream –6 to +1 region in either duplex or single strand form; control probes lack this region. The primary observation from these data is that the probe containing the duplex region from –6 to +1 (lane 1) is bound less well than all other probes. The inhibition by this region only occurs when it is in the duplex form (lane 2 versus lane 1); when it is single-stranded, the downstream sequence stimulates (lane 2 versus lane 4), as seen previously (15Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9020-9025Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus the opening of the downstream DNA should be accompanied by two favorable changes, a relief from duplex inhibition and a stabilization due to the presence of the single strand. To bypass these differences and focus solely on the –10 region, the –10 duplex probe (7/7 probe in lane 2) and the –10 fork junction probe (7/12 probe in lane 5) were used for binding studies. The amino acid changes made in region 2 are listed in Fig. 2, first column. The 5 aromatics between residues 425 and 434 were changed individually to alanines; for 2 of these whose aromatic character was suggested to be important (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), substitutions were also made that retain aromaticity. Other nearby residues suggested to be of importance were changed to serine to maintain the hydrophilicity of the side chains (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The 13 mutant σs were purified in parallel with wild type and assembled into holoenzymes. Some of these were studied previously and were found to function in intact holoenzymes on wild type promoter probes (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Tomsic M. Tsujikawa L. Panaghie G. Wang Y. Azok J. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31891-31896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 21Gopal V. Ma H.W. Kumaran M.K. Chatterji D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The other mutant σs were confirmed to bind core polymerase using surface plasma resonance (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and holoenzyme binding is confirmed by the mobility in the band shift assays shown below. Binding of Mutant Holoenzymes to G-substituted Duplex DNA—First, the mutant holoenzymes were tested for binding to wild type duplex DNA by EMSA. 1The abbreviations used are: EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; WT, wild type. As shown above, the probe is duplex with the lac UV5 sequences –41 to –7, and the incubation and electrophoresis were done on ice to preserve duplex character. Nine of these mutants were studied previously on either lac UV5 duplex probes extending to +1 or λ PR′ duplex probes extending to –12 (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); each was either partially or severely defective in binding in one or both of these contexts. The -fold reduction in binding by each holoenzyme in the current study is shown in Fig. 2 in the WT (wild type) column and also includes the data for the 4 new aromatic substitution mutants. Changes of 1.5-fold or less are not indicated in the table. Examples of the EMSA assays are shown in Fig. 3, top. Of the 9 mutants studied previously in different duplex contexts, only 3 do not show loss of binding in the current experiments using consensus UV5 duplex probes extended to +7 (Y430A, W433A, and Q437S). These also show no significant loss of binding in prior studies on different probes (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The 4 new mutants, at Tyr-430 and Trp-43, were designed to preserve the aromatic character of these 2 amino acids. The data show that aromatic substitutions at Trp-433 yield slight reductions, whereas alanine has no effect. Aromatic substitutions at Tyr-430 are severely defective in binding, whereas alanine has no effect. It appears that the aromatic character of these residues does not have an important role in directing duplex binding. These experiments were repeated using a series of six probes in which guanine substitutions were made individually at each position in the consensus. Each probe contains a G-C pair at the indicated position. The EMSA data for these additional 84 combinations are also shown in Fig. 2. The results are arranged as a table in which guanine-substituted DNA (in columns) is paired with mutated amino acids (in rows). Collectively, the data do not reveal any clear patterns that suggest unique interactions between single amino acids and nucleotides. This would be suggested if, for example, the binding reduction caused by a nucleotide change was not further reduced by an amino acid substitution; if there was unique pairing of nucleotide with amino acids, then changing either or both would lead to the same reduction in binding. The data do not show any such unique pairings. For example, Y425A reduces binding to wild type DNA and all mutant DNAs. Although there are some differences in the quantitative effects of amino acid substitutions at various promoter sequences, we do not consider these to be significant enough to merit interpretation. The one potential exception concerns mutant W434A. This substitution reduces binding on wild type DNA but not on DNA substituted at the fork junction positions –12 and –11. That is, the lower binding caused by these mutant DNAs is not further reduced when Trp-434 is changed to alanine. The substitution does further reduce the lowered binding associated with other mutant promoter sequences. The comparison suggests that Trp-434 could interact with the pair of fork junction nucleotides on duplex DNA. A striking aspect of the data involves mutant Q437S, and to a lesser extent, Y430A. The Q437S substitution actually increases binding on all mutant promoter sequences (the effect is shown for three promoters in Fig. 3). The effect is strongest when position –12 is altered, where wild type holoenzyme binding is reduced ∼5-fold (Fig. 2, top row). When Q437S holoenzyme is used on –12-substituted DNA, the defect is almost fully rescued (Fig. 3). Gln-437 was found previously to be a site for the suppression of a –12 mutant promoter (22Gardella T. Moyle H. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 579-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 23Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Kenney T.J. York K. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9109-9113Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), consistent with these in vitro data. However, the in vitro data show effects on other promoters, suggesting that the in vivo suppression is not likely to be allele-specific. A much smaller effect is seen with Y430A, which enhances binding to a –11-substituted promoter (Fig. 3), but the low signal makes this difficult to quantify. From these data, we infer that Gln-437 and probably Tyr-430 interfere with duplex binding, and this inhibition can be relieved by alanine substitution. Binding to Fork Junction Probes Containing Single-stranded DNA—Prior studies indicated that binding to fork junction DNA containing the melted non-template strand is very tight and involves a large contribution from the DNA backbone (16Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Bases at position –11 and to a lesser extent –7 make a contribution (confirmed in Fig. 4, top row). Most of the protein mutants qualitatively reduce binding to this probe as they did on duplex DNA (compare Fig. 4, first column, with Fig. 2). The exception is T440S, whose effect on duplex recognition is not seen in the context of melted fork junction DNA. Of the mutants studied, it appears that only T440S fails to retain an influence after duplex DNA is melted. The experiments were repeated, pairing each of the 14 mutants with each of the 6 guanine-substituted probes (Fig. 4). For the most part, the mutants lead to modest decreases in binding or have little effect; there is no indication of specific pairing for stabilizing interactions. However, a suppression effect of Y430A was seen again in the data. Y430A partially rescues the defect caused by substitution of guanine at position –11 (Fig. 5), but no rescue is seen of the –7 position substitution (not shown). The effect is comparable with that seen at the same position on duplex DNA (see above). Q437A does not rescue either defect (Fig. 5), in contrast to its general suppression on duplex DNA. It appears that the inhibitory effect of Tyr-430 on the non-consensus –11 promoter is retained after DNA melting, but the general inhibition by Gln-437 is relieved in this context. Binding to Abasic Probes—Recently, we reported experiments using abasic probes in which each consensus base was removed individually, leaving the backbone intact (16Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We repeated aspects of these experiments as comparisons for the extent of changes in binding shown here. The abasic duplex probes were all bound at levels higher than the intact parent (Fig. 6 top); this is likely because the abasic probes facilitate DNA melting, and the melted probes are bound more tightly (as shown above). The removal of any base had little effect using fork probes with single strand tails (Fig. 6, middle); as discussed previously, the affinity for these probes appears to rely significantly on the DNA backbone, and a non-consensus base can be inhibitory. When the bases at –11 and –7 are removed together, the binding is decreased more than 10-fold (Fig. 6, compare middle and top WT (wild type) lanes). The new experiment is shown in Fig. 6 (bottom) where the double abasic probe is tested for binding against the panel of σ mutants. Most substitutions reduce the low level of binding even further (the bands for the mutants co-migrate with bound core polymerase). However, the Y430A holoenzyme not only binds but largely rescues the defect caused by the 2 abasic residues. This is a further indication that the wild type Tyr-430 has the potential to participate in inhibitory interactions with –10 region DNA. The fact that the effect is most strongly revealed when bases are removed and σ is mutated indicates that the inhibitory interactions rely on both σ and the DNA bases. Binding to Isomerized Holoenzyme—The above experiments reflect how the melted –10 region is bound rather than how it becomes melted. They also reflect interactions that could include both isomerized and non-isomerized forms of the holoenzyme. To evaluate binding contributions made by the isomerized polymerase, the experiments were repeated after a heparin challenge to dissociate unisomerized forms of holoenzyme. Only one context revealed an inhibitory interaction (data not shown). This was an increase in binding by Q437S holoenzyme on the wild type promoter. Other guanine-substituted promoters could not be reliably assessed for these σ mutant effects because binding in the heparin challenge assay was essentially undetectable. We conclude that the inhibitory structure still has the potential to affect the isomerized enzyme, but it is difficult to assess the range of this effect. Transcription by Y430A Holoenzyme—These experiments suggest that mutations at Gln-437 and Tyr-430 could enhance transcription, depending on –10 promoter sequence. This is in a sense already known in vivo for Gln-437; Q437R and Q437H were isolated as suppressors of a –12 region mutant promoter (23Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Kenney T.J. York K. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9109-9113Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the current context, this can simply be seen as a relief from unfavorable interactions, not restricted to position –12, that involve Gln-437. As no suppressors at Tyr-430 are known, we tested Y430A against a –11-substituted promoter, at which it relieved inhibition of both duplex and fork + single strand binding (see above). Fig. 7 shows that Y430A holoenzyme is competent to transcribe a consensus promoter on plasmid DNA in vitro and does so at essentially wild type levels (Fig. 7, lanes 1–4). It appears that Tyr-430 is not needed for optimal transcription in this context. When –11 is substituted, transcription is not detectable using wild type holenzyme under these conditions (Fig. 7, lanes 5 and 6). When Y430A holoenzyme is used, a weak but clearly detectable transcript appears (Fig. 7, lanes 7 and 8). We infer that the inhibitory structure involving Tyr-430 is felt both in binding and in transcription of a non-consensus promoter and can be partially relieved by alanine substitution. There are two main observations in this work, neither of which was expected when it was begun. First, certain amino acid substitutions in region 2 of σ70 are found to make σ bind better rather than worse. This leads to the idea that the wild type amino acids can participate in unfavorable interactions and that these are part of the natural design of σ70 function. Second, no amino acid substitution leads to defects that are selectively associated with individual –10 region nucleotides. Taken together, the data suggest the existence of a complex network of contacts involving region 2 of σ70 and the –10 promoter region that include both favorable and unfavorable interactions. Inhibitory Interactions along the Open Complex Pathway—We identified 2 amino acids that have the potential to inhibit holoenzyme in various assays. Gln-437 inhibited duplex DNA binding and did so on both consensus and non-consensus promoters. That is, when Gln-437 was changed to alanine, binding improved. Tyr-430 alanine substitution also could improve binding, but the Y430A holoenzyme differed in two respects. First, the improvement was seen clearly only in the context of promoters where the –11 position had been altered. Second, Y430A could lower binding in the context of other DNA probes. Gln-437 was previously the site of suppression in vivo (23Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Kenney T.J. York K. Youngman P. Moran Jr., C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9109-9113Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) of a –12 promoter change, but the current data suggest that this is not truly allele-specific. The current data also showed that Y430A could weakly suppress a –11 promoter change for transcription in vitro. Because we have not tested every amino acid change in region 2 nor every nucleotide change in the DNA, it is possible that other inhibitory interactions exist. Several other features of the data also point to the importance of inhibitory interactions in controlling the pathway to the formation of open complexes. Nucleotide substitution in the –10 region in single-stranded form can inhibit binding. This defect is not caused simply by the loss of a contact to the consensus base because removal of a single base has little effect (Ref. 16Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar and see above). Moreover, the overall pattern of binding losses shows no obvious one-to-one pairing of nucleotides and amino acids (discussed above). Taken together, these independent observations suggest that a large component of sequence-specific recognition involves unfavorable interactions dictated by non-consensus DNA bases. That is, inclusion of a non-consensus base should lead to active interference with the progress of open complex formation. The process should be slowed further by the inhibitory influence of duplex DNA between –6 and the start site (Fig. 1). A very considerable body of data, both structural and biochemical, exists on the interaction between σ region 2 and the promoter –10 element DNA (see the Introduction). The current data are for the most part consistent with those studies but cannot distinguish among the models proposed. The inconsistencies can largely be attributed to context as the magnitude of defects clearly depends on which promoter probe is used and which promoter elements are associated with it (see also Ref. 16Fenton M.S. Gralla J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Overall, it appears that the most important amino acids are between positions 414 and 440 of σ (17Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 18Tomsic M. Tsujikawa L. Panaghie G. Wang Y. Azok J. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31891-31896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the most important nucleotides for σ interaction are those on the non-template strand (5Roberts C.W. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 495-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) at the fork junction positions –12 and –11 (14Guo Y. Wang L. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3736-3745Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 26Guo Y. Lew C.M. Gralla J.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2242-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). High resolution structures of the holoenzyme exist (7Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 27Vassylyev D.G. Sekine S. Laptenko O. Lee J. Vassylyeva M.N. Borukhov S. Yokoyama S. Nature. 2002; 417: 712-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), but resolution is lacking in the σ component bound with fork junction DNA, in which the overall holoenzyme structure is clearly changed. The manner in which these determinants combine to contribute to positive and negative effects will likely require both further structural analysis and biochemical kinetic studies. The key new point here is that the kinetic pathway is likely to be strongly influenced by unfavorable interactions with –10 region bases that become increasingly important as the bases deviate from the consensus. Implications for σ and Promoter Function—The interaction between σ and fork junction DNA elements appears to have widespread significance. In the case of σ54 holoenzyme, these interactions have a very strong inhibitory component (28Wang L. Guo Y. Gralla J.D. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7558-7565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); indeed, they prevent prebound polymerase from melting the DNA until signaled by an activator (26Guo Y. Lew C.M. Gralla J.D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2242-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of σ38 holoenzyme, no inhibitory interactions were detected in experiments similar to those conducted here (29Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 329: 941-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 30Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47420-47427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). That case is the polar opposite of σ54 as binding is very weak but DNA melting is facile. The weak inhibitory structure associated with the fork junction at σ70 promoters represents an intermediate case. This would be appropriate as the σ70 holoenzyme has the most diversity in terms of promoter use, and therefore, physiology could benefit from being regulated at both the binding and the open complex steps. The very large majority of σ70 promoters have non-consensus –10 regions, and these should influence the degree of active inhibition applied to holoenzyme interactions. In this context, amino acids such as Gln-437 and Tyr-430 help holoenzyme to function appropriately by moderating DNA binding and complex isomerization so as to make σ70 promoters subject to widespread regulation.

In a refined human E1b active-site structure, His291-α, which aligns with His407 in Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase and His263 in yeast transketolase, is on a largely ordered phosphorylation loop. The imidazole ring of His291-α in E1b coordinates to the terminal phosphate oxygen atoms of bound ThDP. The N3 atom of wild-type His146-β′, which can be protonated, binds a water molecule and points toward the aminopyrimidine ring of ThDP. Remarkably, the H291A-α mutation results in a complete order-to-disorder transition of the loop region, which precludes the binding of the substrate lipoyl-bearing domain to E1b. The H146A-β′ mutation, on the other hand, does not alter the loop structure, but nullifies the reductive acylation activity of E1b. Our results suggest that: 1) His291-α plays a structural rather than a catalytic role in the binding of cofactor ThDP and the lipoyl-bearing domain to E1b, and 2) His146-β′ is an essential catalytic residue, probably functioning as a proton donor in the reductive acylation of lipoamide on the lipoyl-bearing domain.

The heterotetramer catalyzes both the ThDP-mediated decarboxylation of the α-ketoacids (Reaction 2) and the reductive acylation of the lipoyl moiety covalently attached to the β-hairpin tip of the lipoic acid-bearing domain (LBD) on the E2b subunit (Reaction 3).

These E1b proteins are heterotetramers each containing two α- and two β-subunits that form two ThDP-binding pockets at the α/β′ and the α′/β interfaces.

In contrast, details of the catalytic mechanism for Reaction 3 are not fully understood. Based on chemical studies with d,l-S-methyllipoic acid methyl ester as a model substrate, Pan and Jordan (7Pan K. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1357-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) proposed the presence of a general acid catalyst located on the E1 enzyme, which, during reductive acylation, serves as a proton donor for the S6 atom of lipoamide on the E2 subunit. The Pseudomonas E1b structure shows that for the reductive acylation reaction to occur, the oxidized lipoyl-lysine residue on the LBD needs to penetrate a 20-Å long funnel-shaped active-site channel of E1b (2Ævarsson A. Seger K. Turley S. Sokatch J.R. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The acyl group in the resultant S-acyldihydrolipoamide is then transferred, in an E2b-catalyzed acyltransfer reaction, to coenzyme A (CoASH) thus yielding an acyl-CoA, a product of the overall reaction catalyzed by the BCKD complex (Reaction 1). A recent study with the E1 component (E1p) of Escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase complex showed that alteration of the His407 residue, which is equivalent to His291-α in human E1b (Fig. 1), inactivates the reductive acetylation of lipoamide covalently attached to LBD of the E2p subunit (8Nemeria N Arjanan P. Brunskill A. Sheibani F. Wei W. Yan Y. Zhang S. Jordan F. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15459-15467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). His407 in E. coli E1p aligns with His263 in yeast transketolase (Fig. 1); the latter has been proposed to function as a nucleophile in the transketolase reaction (9Fiedler E. Golbik R. Schneider G. Tittmann K. Neef H. Konig S. Hubner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16051-16058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). According to this alignment and site-directed mutagenesis data, Nemeria et al. (8Nemeria N Arjanan P. Brunskill A. Sheibani F. Wei W. Yan Y. Zhang S. Jordan F. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15459-15467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) proposed that His407 in the bacterial E1p is a catalytic residue in the reductive acetylation reaction of lipoamide on the E2p (also fused α and β) subunit. However, His407 is disordered and not visible in the E. coli E1p crystal structure (8Nemeria N Arjanan P. Brunskill A. Sheibani F. Wei W. Yan Y. Zhang S. Jordan F. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15459-15467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and therefore no structural information is available to support this hypothesis. We are interested in the roles of the only two histidine residues in the human E1b active site, i.e. His291-α and His146-β′ that are equivalent to His312-α and His131-β′ in Pseudomonas E1b, respectively (Fig. 1). The H292A-α substitution in rat E1b, which aligns with His291-α in human E1b, was shown to result in reduced ThDP binding and the loss of the reconstituted overall activity of the rat BCKD complex measured by a spectrophotometric assay (5Hawes J.W.

Similar results were obtained with the corresponding human E1b variant H291A-α, except that residual overall activity was detected using a more sensitive radiochemical assay (6Wynn R.M. Ho R. Chuang J.L. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4168-4174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that in a refined human E1b structure His146-β′ is pointing towards the aminopyrimidine ring of the cofactor ThDP, whereas His291-α, which aligns with His407 in E. coli E1p and His263 in yeast transketolase, is on a mostly ordered phosphorylation loop in the human E1b structure. The imidazole ring of His291-α in E1b coordinates to the terminal phosphate oxygen atoms of the ThDP. The H291A-α mutation results in a complete disorder of the loop region and drastically reduces the binding of lipoylated LBD (lip-LBD) to E1b. The H146A mutation does not alter the loop structure, but completely abrogates the reductive acylation (Reaction 3) activity of E1b. Based on these results, we propose that: 1) His291-α plays a structural instead of a catalytic role in the binding of cofactor ThDP and the lip-LBD to E1b, and 2) His146-β′ is an essential catalytic residue, probably functioning as a proton donor in the reductive acylation reaction catalyzed by human E1b. Materials—N-terminally or C-terminally His6-tagged wild-type and mutant E1b proteins were produced as described previously, except that primers containing the desired mutations were used for site-directed mutagenesis (10Wynn R.M.

C-terminally His6-tagged LBD (residues 1–84 of the E2b subunit) was expressed (11Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36905-36908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and lipoylated in vitro with d,l-thioctic acid (oxidized) using LplA ligase as described previously (12Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A C-terminally His6-tagged human E1b was prepared also as described previously (3Ævarsson A.

Enzyme Assays for Decarboxylation Activities—The reconstituted overall reaction for the oxidative decarboxylation (Reaction 1) of α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate was carried out with wild-type or mutant E1b in the presence of excess lipoylated E2b (lip-E2b) and E3 as described previously (12Chuang J.L. Davie J.R. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 324: 192-200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by E1b alone (Reaction 2) was assayed spectrophotometrically using 0.1 Xmm α-ketoisovalerate (KIV) as a substrate and 0.05 mm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) as an artificial electron acceptor as also described previously (13Wynn R.M.

Assay for the Reductive Acylation (Reaction 3) of Lipoylated LBD— The assay was modified from that described previously (14Graham L.D. Packman L.C. Perham R.N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1574-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture in a volume of 0.2 ml contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 1 mm ThDP, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm [U-14C]KIV (specific activity 127,500 cpm/nmol), 132 nm E1b (heterotetramers), and 20 μm C-terminally His6-tagged lip-LBD. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the radiolabeled α-ketoacid. After incubation at 22 °C for 45 s, radioactivity incorporated into lip-LBD was extracted with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The resin was washed 3 times with the above phosphate buffer containing 200 mm NaCl and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The washed resin containing radiolabeled lip-LBD was added to 2 ml of scintillation mixture, and radioactivity was counted. Binding Studies by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Human E1b and lip-LBD, both C-terminally His6-tagged, were dialyzed exhaustively against the same reservoir of 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mm EDTA to remove bound Mg2+ ions and ThDP. Immediately prior to ITC measurements, MgCl2 and ThDP stock solutions were added to both E1b and lip-LBD to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Titrations were carried out at 20 °C in a MicroCal (Northampton, MA) VP-ITC microcalorimeter. The solution of 1.5 mm lip-LBD in the syringe was added in 7-μl increments to the reaction cell containing 1.8 ml of 25 μm human E1b (based on the αβ heterodimer). Binding isotherms derived from heat changes were used to calculate the standard free energy of binding (ΔG 0) according to the equation: ΔG 0 = –RTlnKa , where R is the gas constant, T the absolute temperature, and Ka the association constant. From these binding isotherms, the number of binding sites (n) was obtained, and changes in enthalpy (ΔH 0) and entropy (ΔS 0) were calculated according to the equation: ΔG 0 = ΔH 0 – TΔS 0. Curve fitting and the derivation of thermodynamic parameters were carried out with the ORIGIN software package provided by MicroCal. Concentrations of human E1b heterodimers and lip-LBD monomers were determined by A 280 nm using calculated extinction coefficients (in mg–1 ml·cm–1) of 1.14 for the former and 1.07 for the latter.

Fluorescence intensities were recorded at 25 °C using a 3-ml quartz cuvette at an excitation wavelength of 290 nm and an emission wavelength of 335 nm. Slit widths were set at 5 nm for both excitation and emission. A 290-nm cut-off emission filter was installed to reduce light scattering effects. Protein concentrations for E1b and ThDP (A 235 nm = 11,300 m– cm–1, pH > 7.0) were determined spectrophotometrically as described above. The concentration for all protein samples was 0.23 μm (as heterotetramers) in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2. Fluorescence readings were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects using Equation 1 (16Lakowicz J.R. Maliwal B.P. Cherek H. Balter A.

Three different readings were taken and averaged with the experiment conducted three times (n = 3). The binding data were fitted by nonlinear regression using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Essex Junction, VT) according to Equation 2 describing a bimolecular reaction (17Nemeria N.

The parameters determined by the fitting procedure were ΔF max and Kd . Crystallization of Wild-type and Mutant E1b Proteins—Wild-type and mutant E1b proteins (C-terminally His-tagged on the β-subunit) were produced as described (3Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S. Chuang D.T. Hol W.G.J. Structure. 2000; 8: 277-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown at 20 °C via the vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of E1b (20–25 mg/ml) in 50 mm Na-HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 250 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol with a well solution (1.4–1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol). MgCl2 or MnCl2 and ThDP at 4 mm each were added to both the well solution and the cryo-buffer (see below). Serially diluted crushed crystals were used for microseeding 1 day after the drops were set up. Crystals appeared 1 day after seeding and grew to a maximum size of 120 × 800 μm within 10 days, which were stabilized for 12 h by soaking in fresh well solution. Crystals were cryo-protected by stepwise exchanges with a cryo-buffer containing 1.6 m ammonium sulfate, 50 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 100 mm KCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% (v/v) glycerol. Mn2+ ions could replace Mg2+ required for the binding of ThDP to E1b. The presence of Mn2+ ions in crystals resulted in improved x-ray diffraction qualities without affecting the catalytic properties (data not shown). Crystals obtained with this procedure exhibited the symmetry of space group P3121 with cell parameters of ∼145 × 145 × 69 Å and contained one αβ heterodimer per asymmetric unit. They diffracted x-rays significantly better (up to a minimum Bragg spacing, d min, of 1.6 Å) than those described by Ævarsson et al. (d min of 2.7 Å) (3Ævarsson A. Chuang J.L. Wynn R.M. Turley S.

X-ray Crystallography—Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid propane and kept at about 100K during data collection at beamlines 19ID and 19BM (Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL), for the H291A-α and H146A-β′ mutants. Data from the wild-type crystal were collected at 110K using CuKα radiation from an in-house rotating anode source (Rigaku RU-300, Japan) and an R-AXIS-IV detector (MSC Industrial Supply, Houston, TX).

Mutant structures were subsequently determined by Fourier techniques. Refinement of the models was carried out in the program package CNS 1.1 (19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L.

The refinement protocol consisted of an initial simulated annealing step to remove model bias, followed by cycles of conjugate gradient minimization and calculation of anisotropic displacement parameters interspersed with manual adjustments to the model using the program O (20Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). The electron density clearly showed the presence of several glycerol molecules in the crystal structure. After the refinement of the protein part was complete, solvent molecules were added where stereochemically reasonable. The quality of the models was finally checked against composite simulated annealing 2Fo – Fc omit maps (calculated with CNS), which were found to be nearly identical to regular σA-weighted 2Fo – Fc electron density maps. Residues in flexible regions (particularly at the termini and in some surface-exposed loop regions) that did not have corresponding electron density were excluded from the models. Residues with corresponding electron density for the main chain atoms but not for the side chain atoms were added with the side chains in the most favorable rotamer conformations that did not lead to steric clashes. Single residues with little corresponding electron densities were included in the model, when they were flanked by other residues with well-defined electron density. Two residues (Ile266-α and Arg255-β) had main chain φ and ψ angles that would place them in the disallowed regions in the Ramachandran plot. The corresponding electron densities were, however, very well defined and thus their conformations were dictated by the structural context. Complete refinement statistics are listed in Table I (part B). Oxidative Decarboxylation (Reaction 1) Catalyzed by Wild-type and Mutant E1b—Both His291-α and His146-β′ residues were mutated, and effects of these mutations on the overall reaction (Reaction 1) catalyzed by the reconstituted BCKD complex were measured radiochemically in the presence of excess lip-E2b and E3. Table II shows that H146A-β′ and H146N-β′ substitutions completely abolish the overall reaction catalyzed by the reconstituted BCKD complex, with KIV or ThDP as the variable substrate or cofactor, respectively. H291A-α, H291N-α, and H291Q-α mutations result in significant increases in Km for KIV and ThDP, indicating reduced binding affinity for both the substrate and the cofactor. Concomitantly, k cat is reduced to ∼5–10% of the wild type, as measured with varying concentrations of KIV or ThDP. The marked reductions in catalytic efficiencies associated with the His291-α and His146-β′ substitutions establish the critical role of these two residues in the overall reaction catalyzed by the BCKD complex.Table IIKinetic parameters for the overall reaction catalyzed by wild-type E1, His291-α and His146-β′ mutant E1bWild-type/mutantsKm (KIV)aThe reconstituted overall activity of the human BCKD complex was measured radiochemically using α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate as a substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinetic values represent the average of three independent measurements.kcatk cat/Km (×103)Km (ThDP)kcatk cat/Km (×103)μms-1s-1 μm-1μms-1s-1 μm-1WT59 ± 48.65 ± 0.15146 ± 140.55 ± 0.66.38 ± 0.9511,600 ± 334H146A-β′00H146N-β′00H291A-αbData for H291A-α are taken from Ref. 6.206 ± 160.58 ± 0.52.8 ± 0.124 ± 20.73 ± 0.331 ± 5H291N-α118 ± 130.67 ± 0.25.6 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.30.6 ± 0.6420 ± 11H291Q-α203 ± 110.49 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.39 ± 2.30.41 ± 0.1245 ± 3a The reconstituted overall activity of the human BCKD complex was measured radiochemically using α-keto[1-14C]isovalerate as a substrate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinetic values represent the average of three independent measurements.b Data for H291A-α are taken from Ref. 6Wynn R.M.

Open table in a new tab His146-β′ in E1b as a Catalytic Residue for Reductive Acylation of lip-LBD (Reaction 3)—To dissect the mechanism by which the His291-α and His146-β′ mutations impede the overall reaction (Reaction 1), ThDP-mediated decarboxylation (Reaction 2) and reductive acylation (Reaction 3) catalyzed by wild-type and mutant E1b were measured. To facilitate Reaction 2, DCPIP was present in the assay mixture as an artificial electron acceptor to promote the oxidation of enamine-ThDP. As shown in Fig. 2, the His291-α mutations have modest adverse effects on ThDP-mediated decarboxylation with 52, 43, and 32% of the wild-type activity for H291A-α, H291N-α, and H291Q-α, respectively, whereas H146A-β′ and H146N-β′ variants exhibit only 6 and 11% of the wild-type activity, respectively. Activity for the E1b-catalyzed reductive acylation of lip-LBD (Reaction 3) is more severely impeded than ThDP-mediated decarboxylation in these mutants. Rates for Reaction 3 are 3, 7, and 2.2% of the wild type for H291A-α, H291N-α, and H291Q-α substitutions, respectively. Both H146A-β′ and H146N-β′ mutants show no detectable reductive acylation activity. The data establish His146-β′ as an essential catalytic residue for E1b-mediated reductive acylation (see “Discussion”). Affinity of E1b Mutants for Cofactor ThDP—Dissociation constants (Kd) of wild-type E1b and the His146-β′ and His291-α variants for cofactor ThDP were measured by tryptophan fluorescence quenching. Fig. 3 shows the percent quenching versus ThDP concentrations with wild-type (panel A) and mutant (panel B) E1b. Wild-type E1b exhibits a Kd value for ThDP of 1.52 μm, whereas the H291A-α and the H146A-β′ mutants show significantly elevated Kd values for ThDP of 39.3 and 47.1 μm, respectively (Table III). Therefore, substitutions at either H291A-α or H146A-β′ affect the binding of ThDP.Table IIIDissociation constants (Kd) for the binding of cofactor ThDP to wild-type, H291A-α, and H146A-β′ E1b as determined by fluorescence quenchingE1b proteinK daDissociation constants represent the average of three independent measurements.Maximal quenchingμm%Wild-type1.52 ± 0.0160.1 ± 1.7H291A-α39.3 ± 5.640.2 ± 2.1H146A-β′47.1 ± 2.847.1 ± 2.8a Dissociation constants represent the average of three independent measurements.

It has been found previously that a 5′-upstream cis-element, CCGCCACAC, is responsible for regulating GSH11 expression and that several proteins bind to this element (Miyake, T., Kanayama, M., Sammoto, H., and Ono, B. (2002) Mol. Genet. Genomics 266, 1004–1011). In this report we present evidence that the most prominent of these proteins is VDE, known previously as the homing endonuclease encoded by VMA1. We show also that GSH11 is not expressed in a VDE-deleted strain and that inability to express the GSH11 of this strain is overcome by introduction of the coding region of VDE or the entire VMA1 gene. It is also found that VDE does not cut DNA in the vicinity of the GSH11 cis-element. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the target of rapamycin (TOR) signal-transduction system, is found to enhance expression of GSH11 in a VDE-dependent manner under conditions of sulfur starvation. These results indicate that GSH11 is regulated by a system sensitive to sulfur starvation (presumably via cysteine depletion) and a more general system involving the nutritional starvation signal mediated by the TOR system. Both systems need to be operational (inhibition of TOR and sulfur starvation) for full expression of GSH11.

Depletion of glutathione causes an increase of reactive oxygen species and results in death of the cell (9Kane D.J. Sarafian T.A. Anton R. Hahn H. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. Ord T. Bredesen D.E.

Glutathione is the most abundant sulfur-containing compound in many organisms (12Meister A. Tate S.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 559-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar, 13Penninckx M.J. Jaspers C.J. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1982; 80: 291-301Google Scholar, 14Rennenberg H. Phytochemistry. 1982; 21: 2771-2781Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It contains cysteine and produces cysteine by degradation. Thus, it acts as a reservoir of cysteine, thiol groups, and sulfur (15Elskens M.T. Jaspers C.J. Penninckx M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Under conditions of sulfur starvation, glutathione is the last of various sulfur-containing compounds to decrease in the cell. 1B.-I. Ono, T. Hazu, and M. Kanayama, personal communication. It is also known that, under conditions of sulfur starvation, Saccharomyces cerevisiae utilizes sulfate, produced by the consumption of glutathione, as a sulfur source (16Miyake T. Sammoto H. Kanayama M. Tomochika K. Shinoda S. Ono B. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that maintenance of the intracellular level of glutathione is of great importance for viability in terms of sustaining sulfur metabolism and protecting the cell from oxidative stress. Because many organisms have the ability to utilize exogenous glutathione, we have focused our attention on the glutathione uptake activity of S. cerevisiae and have shown previously that this organism has two kinetically distinguishable glutathione transport systems, i.e. an inducible high affinity transporter (GSH-P1) and a constitutive low affinity one (GSH-P2) (17Miyake T. Hazu T. Yoshida S. Kanayama M. Tomochika K. Shinoda S. Ono B. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 1858-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). GSH-P1 mediates transport of pentapeptides as well as enkephalin, but it should be mentioned that the affinity of GSH-P1 to the oligopeptides is much lower than that to glutathione (1Miyake T. Kanayama M. Sammoto H. Ono B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). GSH-P1 has characteristics common to the OPT family of transporters present in fungi but not in mammals and bacteria; this is the reason why it is also referred to as OPT1 (18Hauser M. Donhardt A.M.

Sharp J.S. Naider F.R. Becker J.M. Stacey G. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Glutathione and oligopeptides are convenient and useful sulfur sources if they are available in the environment. For this reason also, we are interested in the GSH-P1 transporter, particularly in the regulation of its production. We have already found that the gene coding for GSH-P1, i.e. HGT1/GSH11, has a novel cis-acting regulatory motif, CCGCCACAC, in its 5′ upstream region (1Miyake T. Kanayama M. Sammoto H. Ono B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed proteins that bound to the regulatory motif of GSH11 and found that the most prominent was VDE, the homing endonuclease derived from VMA1. We investigated the role of VDE in the regulation of GSH11 and also examined the effect of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the target of rapamycin (TOR) 2The abbreviations used are: TOR, target of rapamycin; SF, sulfur-free; DIG, digoxigenin; DTT, dithiothreitol. signal transduction system, on the regulation of GSH11. Strains and Media—The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table I. Strains SF1-1C and YPH500 are wild types in regard to the GSH-P1 activity and regulation of GSH-P1. They have the wild type allele in the VMA1 locus. Strain YOC2176 is a gene-manipulated derivative of strain YPH500; it has the VMA1-101 (vde-delta) allele in which the whole VDE coding region is deleted from VMA1 (21Nogami S. Fukuda T. Nagai Y.

Standard DNA manipulation procedures were adopted (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Polymerase Chain Reaction—Amplification of DNA fragment by PCR was carried out using TaKaRa ExTaq™ polymerase and a thermal cycler (Atto). The PCR program we adopted was as follows: step 1, denaturation at 93 °C for 1 min; step 2, 30 cycles of denaturation at 93 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min; and step 3, extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR reaction mixture (50 μl) was prepared as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Identification of DNA-binding Proteins—Cells of strain SF1-1C were grown overnight in YPD medium and transferred to SF medium. After incubation for 16 h, they were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine-HCl). The cells were resuspended in 0.3 ml of the same buffer to which was added 0.4-ml glass beads. The suspension was vortexed in an ice bath for 10 cycles of 30 s of shaking and 60 s of cooling. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used as cell extract. Two complementary 41-mer DNAs, corresponding to the GSH11 sequence from –371 to –331 (5′-TTCCGGCCCGCCACACCTCCGACTACAAGACGCCACATCTA-3′) containing the cis-element (underlined), were custom synthesized, annealed, and used as a double strand DNA probe, referred to as ce16. The probe was end-labeled with terminal transferase and digoxigenin (DIG)-11-ddUTP according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). Following this, the DIG-labeled DNA probe, ce16-DIG, was bound to anti-DIG magnetic particle as described by the manufacturer (Roche Diagnostics). Binding reactions were carried out in a 200-μl binding buffer (10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm DTT, 1% (w/v) Tween 20, and 30 mm KCl) containing 7.5 pmol of ce16-DIG/anti-DIG particles and ∼0.72 mg of cell extract protein. The binding reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Complexes of magnetic particles and the DIG-DNA probe with bound proteins were separated with a magnetic separator and washed four times with binding buffer. Binding proteins were eluted by successive incubation with a total of 30 μl (3× 10 μl) of homogenization buffer containing KCl, the concentration of which was increased stepwise from 0.4 to 1 m. Aliquots of the eluted fractions were fractionated on SDS-PAGE (5–20% gradient gel, 64 V, ∼3 h), and the gels were silver-stained for observation. For identification of the protein bands, the binding reaction was scaled up to a total of 900 μl containing 105 pmol of magnetic particles and the DIG-DNA probe and ∼3.9 mg of protein extract and concentrated by elution in a final volume of 20 μl. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroblotting (Nova-blot: Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and bands of interest were cut out for protein sequencing, which was carried out by APRO Life Science Institute, Inc., Naruto, Japan. Electrophretic Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophretic mobility shift assays were carried out as described previously (1Miyake T. Kanayama M. Sammoto H. Ono B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). DNA-protein binding was achieved at 25 °C for 30 min in a mixture (10 μl) containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm DTT, 1% (w/v) Tween 20, 30 mm KCl, 0.8 ng of DIG-labeled DNA probe (ce16), and 1 μl of the solution containing ce16-binding proteins; experimental details can be found under the heading “Identification of DNA-binding Proteins” above. Reporter Gene Assay—A DNA fragment corresponding to the segment from –371 to 33 in the 5′-upstream region of GSH11 was PCR-amplified using the genomic DNA of strain SF1-1C as template. The primers used are 5′-AATACCCGGGTTCCGGCCCGCCACACCTCCGACTA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACAGGATCCAACGAGTCGCTCTCCCTATAA-3′ (reverse). The PCR product was digested with SmaI and BamHI and inserted into the SmaI/BamHI site proximal to the coding region of lacZ in pMC1587 to generate plasmid EUG11-9; note that in the resultant fusion protein the first eight amino acids of the β-galactosidase were replaced with the first 11 amino acids of GSH11. The structure of plasmid EUG11-9 was confirmed by sequencing, and EUG11-9 was used to transform strains YPH500, YOC2176, YOC2176/pYO314-VMA1, and YOC2176/YCpTV-VDEc. After incubation of the resultant transformants in SF medium or SF medium supplemented with 0.1 mm cysteine for 16 h, the cells were harvested and lysed. Then, the β-galactosidase activity was measured by mean of the hydrolysis of o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) to produce o-nitrophenol (ONP) and galactose. β-Galactosidase activity (in units) was calculated using the formula A 420 × 1000/min/ml/OD 600 at 37 °C. Northern Blot Hybridization—Strains YPH500 and YOC2176 were grown overnight in YPD medium. The cells were harvested and suspended in SF medium or SF medium supplemented with 0.1 mm cysteine. After incubation for 16 h, total RNA was extracted by the method of Elder et al. (30Elder R.T. Loh E.Y. Davis R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2432-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). RNA (20 μg per lane) was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to Northern blot hybridization using a 741-bp fragment corresponding to a portion (710–1450) of GSH11 as the probe (1Miyake T. Kanayama M. Sammoto H. Ono B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). VDE Cleavage—An 846-bp DNA fragment including the cis-element of GSH11 was PCR-amplified using genomic DNA of strain SF1-1C as template. Primers used are 5′-AATACCCGGGTAGAGCCATAGTGTGGCAGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACAGGATCCAACGAGTCGCTCTCCCTATAA-3′ (reverse). About 0.22 μg of the PCR product was incubated at 37 or 25 °C for 16 h with 2 units of purified VDE (New England Biolabs) dissolved in 20 μl of buffer (100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT, pH 8.6) supplemented with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5% SDS, and the samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1× Tris acetate buffer with EDTA (TAE) on a 0.7% agarose gel. After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes) and photographed. Detection of Proteins Binding to the cis-Element of GSH11—We noted previously by using the gel mobility shift assay that S. cerevisiae has protein(s) that binds to the cis-element of GSH11 (1Miyake T. Kanayama M. Sammoto H. Ono B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We decided to extend this line of investigation. A DNA fragment (ce16) that contained the 5′-up-stream regulatory element (CCGCCACAC) of GSH11 was DIG-labeled and adsorbed to magnetic beads (see “Experimental Procedures”). The magnetic beads were mixed with the cell extract, collected, thoroughly washed, and then suspended consecutively in homogenization buffer containing increasing concentrations of KCl (from 0.4 to 1 m). Each supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1, a large proportion of the bound proteins eluted in the 0.4 m KCl fraction, and some eight bands could be distinguished in this fraction. Moreover, the 0.4 m KCl fraction caused a reduction in the electrophoretic mobility of the ce16 probe (data not shown). We conclude that this fraction contains protein(s) that bind to the ce16 fragment. The most prominent protein in this fraction had a size of ∼50 kDa (Fig. 1). We determined its N-terminal amino acid sequence and obtained the sequence “*FAKGTNVL” (* indicates refractory to analysis). Using a homology search we found that VDE, the homing endonuclease encoded by VMA1, has the identical N-terminal amino acid sequence (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Identification of the 50 kDa protein. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The 50-kDa protein was cut out and subjected to sequencing. From a homology search, the N-terminal sequence was matched with the VDE protein. * indicates refractory to analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Involvement of VDE in Regulation of GSH11—To investigate the involvement of VDE in the regulation of GSH11, we conducted reporter gene assays using a strain in which the VDE coding region of VMA1 was deleted. For this experiment we constructed a plasmid in which the 5′-upstream region (from –371 to 33) of GSH11 was inserted in front of the coding region of the E. coli lacZ gene of the expression vector, pMC1587. Strains YPH500 (VMA1) and YOC2176 (a vde-delta derivative of YPH500) were transformed with the resultant plasmid, designated EUG11-9. Representative transformants were incubated for 16 h in SF medium or SF medium supplemented with 0.1 mm cysteine. The transformants derived from the VMA1 strain had higher β-galactosidase activity in sulfur starvation conditions and markedly lower activity in the presence of cysteine in the growth medium. In contrast, those derived from the vde-delta strain had very low β-galactosidase activity in both sulfur starvation and cysteine-supplemented conditions (Fig. 3). We assayed the mRNA contents of the above mentioned cells by Northern blot hybridization using GSH11 as the probe (see “Experimental Procedures”). The VMA1 strain revealed a substantial level of expression of GSH11 in SF medium, whereas the vde-delta strain revealed no detectable level of expression (data not shown). Moreover, we found that the vde-delta strain recovered the ability of regulation of GSH11 if transformed with either plasmid pYO314-VMA1 (carrying the entire region of VMA1) or plasmid YCpTV-VDEc (carrying the entire VDE coding region). When the representative transformants were subjected to the reporter gene assay, they, like the VMA1 strain (YPH500), yielded substantial levels of β-galactosidase activity in sulfur starvation conditions (Fig. 3). All these results clearly indicate that VDE is involved in the expression of GSH11. VDE Does Not Cut the GSH11 cis-Element—VDE is known as a homing endonuclease, but its target sequence remains obscure; that is, although single base substitutions reduced the susceptibility of target DNAs, none gained complete resistance to VDE (31Gimble F.S. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21844-21853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Gimble F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4215-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The precise boundary of the target sequence is also not clear. Nevertheless, the following sequence is thought to be the most likely target of VDE (↓ indicates cleavage site) (33Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar): 5′-ATCTATGTCGG GTGC↓GGAGAAAGAGGTAATGAAATGGCA-3′ and 3′-TAGATACAGCC↓CACG CCTCTTTCTCCATTACTTTACCGT-5′ Because the cis-element (CCGCCACAC) of GSH11 (1Miyake T. Kanayama M. Sammoto H. Ono B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) is somewhat similar to this sequence (underlined), we tested whether VDE binds to and cuts at the GSH11 cis-element. An 846-bp DNA fragment containing the GSH11 cis-element was PCR-amplified (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the product was mixed with VDE and incubated for 16 h at 37 or 25 °C. We detected no sign of cleavage of the fragment (data not shown), leading to the conclusion that VDE does not cut DNA at this position. This is a strong indication that VDE acts as a transcriptional regulatory factor for GSH11. Effect of Rapamycin on the Expression of GSH11—It is well established that S. cerevisiae cells respond to both the quality and quantity of nutrients and that the TOR proteins, via their kinase activities, are responsible for maintaining a balance between protein synthesis and degradation in response to changes in nutritional conditions (34Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). For example, the TOR system up-regulates genes involved in ribosome biosynthesis, and inhibition of the expression of these genes induces autophagy. It is also known that the TOR system modulates the expression of genes responsible for the biosynthesis of various amino acids and amino acid permeases (34Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Because GSH11 is induced by deprivation of sulfur, we suspected that GSH11 would be under the control of the TOR system. To test this, we examined the effect of rapamycin, an inhibitor of the TOR system (34Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), on the expression of GSH11. We transformed strains YPH500 (VMA1), YOC2176 (vde-delta), YOC2176/pYO314-VMA1, and YOC2176/YCpTV-VDEc with plasmid EUG11-9. The obtained transformants were incubated in SF medium in the presence or absence of 200 nm rapamycin and with or without 0.1 mm cysteine. It can be seen (Fig. 4) that in the VMA1 strain rapamycin caused an increase of β-galactosidase activity only in the absence of cysteine. Contrastingly, in the vde-delta strain rapamycin did not affect β-galactosidase regardless of the presence or absence of cysteine. This result strongly indicates that GSH11 is under the control of the TOR regulatory system and that this regulatory system is mediated by VDE. However, it appears that the expression of GSH11, unlike that of many other metabolic genes, is also coupled to another regulatory system specific for sulfur starvation and, especially, cysteine depletion (see “Discussion”). We have found that at least eighteight proteins bind to the 5′-upstream region of GSH11. The most prominent turned out to be VDE, a protein produced by cleavage of the VMA1 gene product Vma1p. Vma1p consists of three segments, A, B, and C, and is processed to produce two peptides, B and AC. Peptide B corresponds to VDE, and AC to the vacuolar H+-ATPase (35Hirata R. Ohsumk Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VDE acts as a homing endonuclease that cuts the VDE-free VMA1 product at a specific site, and this triggers DNA repair using the VDE-containing VMA1 gene on the homologous chromosome as template. As a consequence, a heterozygous diploid whose genotype is VMA1 (ABC)/VMA1-101 (AC) is converted to a VMA1 (ABC)/VMA1 (ABC) homozygous diploid. VDE is thus thought to be a kind of self-propagating, or selfish, gene (21Nogami S. Fukuda T. Nagai Y. Yabe S. Sugiura M. Mizutani R. Satow Y. Anraku Y. Ohya Y. Yeast. 2002; 19: 773-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 32Gimble F.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4215-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 36Goddard M.R. Greig D. Burt A. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2001; 268: 2537-2542Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although the behavior of VDE as a homing endonuclease is well established, its biological significance remains obscure. Our data, however, indicate that VDE binds to the regulatory element of GSH11, the gene encoding the high affinity glutathione transporter, without cutting DNA at this position. We have further demonstrated that VDE is essential for expression of GSH11. This is the first pointer to the otherwise obscure role of VDE. It should be emphasized that VDE homing takes place in the process of sporulation that is initiated by nitrogen starvation (33Gimble F.S. Thorner J. Nature. 1992; 357: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 37Anraku Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which implies that VDE may be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to perform its homing function in sporulation. This behavior of VDE may be the key to its function as a transcriptional activator of GSH11, because for VDE to act as a transcriptional factor, its localization in the nucleus is a prerequisite. We speculate further that the homing activity of VDE and, thus, an increased level of expression of GSH11 during sporulation is vital for the survival of the cell by means of a supply of a useful sulfur source, glutathione. In relation to nutrient responses, it is well established that various starvation-induced metabolic genes are negatively regulated by the TOR signal transduction system and that rapamycin inhibits this system and induces expression of starvation-induced metabolic genes (34Raught B. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7037-7044Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). We found in this study that rapamycin enhanced transcription of GSH11 only under conditions of sulfur starvation, and this enhancing effect of rapamycin was mediated by VDE. This finding indicates that GSH11 is under the control of the TOR signal transduction system, although in a different way from the regulation of other metabolic genes, because in the case of GSH11 the rapamycin treatment potentiates starvation only in the absence of a sulfur source. It has recently been demonstrated that translocation of VDE is stimulated and stabilized by nitrogen starvation and inactivation of the TOR regulatory system (22Nagai Y. Nogami S. Kumagai-Sano F. Ohya Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1726-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Taking this and our findings into account, we propose a model of how VDE and rapamycin regulate the expression of GSH11 (Fig. 5). In this model the following actions take place. 1) VDE is transported to the nucleus when starved for sulfur or nitrogen or carbon. 2) It binds to the regulatory element of GSH11 but does not cut the DNA; and 3) DNA-bound VDE enhances binding of sulfur- or cysteine-specific regulatory factors that stimulate transcription of GSH11. In the light of this model we are now seeking to identify proteins, other than VDE, that bind to the cis-acting regulatory motif of GSH11. It is also necessary to test whether starvation of sulfur, like starvation of nitrogen or carbon, stimulates translocation of VDE into the nucleus. It is worth mentioning that several genes (or open reading frames) have 5′-upstream sequences identical or similar to the cis-acting motif of GSH11. Of these, CYS3 (coding for cystathionine γ-lyase), MET13 (coding for a putative 5,10-methyl-enetetrahydrofolate reductase), SPE2 (coding for S-adenosyl-methionine decarboxylase), and MET2 (coding for homoserine O-acetyltransferase) are unquestionably involved in sulfur metabolism (1Miyake T. Kanayama M. Sammoto H. Ono B. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2002; 266: 1004-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Whether VDE is involved in the regulation of these genes is another interesting question, and examination of this possibility is underway in our group. We are very grateful to Drs. Y. Ohya and Y. Nagai (Department of Integrated Biosciences, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, Tokyo University) for their kind gifts of the vde-delta strain and the plasmids containing VMA1 and VDE. Their information about VDE was most valuable for development of this work."

Cole G. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 2335-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The major constituent of the extracellular plaques in the brains of AD patients is amyloid β (Aβ), which is cleaved from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β and γ secretases. Patients suffering from the hereditary forms of AD either carry a mutation in the APP gene or in one of the presenilin genes. These mutations cause an alteration in the proteolytic processing of APP, resulting in the formation of more Aβ40 and Aβ42, which are both prone to aggregate and precipitate in the plaques (2Hardy J.

A major difference between APP+1 and APP, except for their distinct C termini, is the lack of the membrane anchor (amino acids 625–648 of APP695) and the lack of the Aβ sequence in APP+1. The presence of the signal peptide and the absence of the membrane anchor make it very likely that APP+1 is also a secretory protein. Indeed, it has been shown that an APP+1-enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion protein is readily secreted from rat neuronal cell lines (16Hersberger M. Santiago-Garcia J. Patarroyo-White S. Yan J. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to determine whether the endogenous human APP+1 is a secretory protein and can be detected in human CSF. Antibodies—The AMY6 peptide (YNVPGHERMGRGRTSSKELA) represents the final 19 amino acids of APP+1 ΔGA exon 9 (see Fig. 1). The peptide was coupled to thyroglobulin by glutaraldehyde, and a rabbit was immunized with a mixture of the coupled peptide and Freund's complete adjuvant (1:1). Several bleedings were collected, and the immunoreactivity of the serum was tested with a spot blot. To the N terminus of the AMY6 peptide an additional tyrosine (Y) was added to allow iodination. 22C11 is a monoclonal antibody directed against amino acids 66 to 81 of the N terminus of APP (17Hilbich C. Monning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody specificity was tested by staining the recombinant APP+1 protein on a Western blot with pre-immune serum, the AMY6 antibody, and pre-adsorbed AMY6 antibody. Cell Lines and Transfections—The human neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line (American Type Culture Collection number CRL-2260) (18Biedler J.L. Roffler-Tarlov S. Schachner M. Freedman L.S. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 3751-3757PubMed Google Scholar) was cultured in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (all media and chemicals from Invitrogen). For Western blot analysis the cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark). The next day, cells were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA per 6-cm dish according to the calcium-phosphate transfection method. The human APP 695 isoform (kindly provided by Dr. T. Hartmann, Heidelberg, Germany) and APP+1 (APP 695 ΔGA exon 9) were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The full sequence of both constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Human Cerebrospinal Fluid—Post-mortem non-hemolytic ventricular CSF was obtained from 50 non-demented controls and 122 neuropathologically confirmed AD patients. In addition, brain homogenates from four non-demented controls and eight AD patients were obtained. The CSF samples and brain tissues were collected by the Netherlands Brain Bank, Amsterdam (coordinator Dr. R. Ravid). Sex, age, brain weight, post-mortem delay, pH of CSF, and clinicopathological data of the patients described in this study can be found in the supplemental material in the on-line version of this article. The concentration of protein content of the CSF was determined with a Bradford assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Recombinant His-tagged APP + 1—Full-length human APP+1 cDNA was cloned into pQE31 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells were transformed with pQE31-APP+1, and recombinant protein production was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The recombinant His6-tagged APP+1 was purified over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column and used as a positive control on the Western blot and for determining the specificity of the APP+1 radioimmunoassay (see below). Western Blotting—Approximately 24 h after transfection, the medium was collected and the cells were resuspended in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, and 1 mm EDTA pH 7.6, containing the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm) and leupeptin (10 μg/ml). Fifteen microliters of human post-mortem CSF was directly mixed with 15 μl of loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol) and put on a gel. Cell culture medium, cell lysates, and CSF were fractionated on SDS-PAGE (7.5% gel) and transferred semi-dry to nitrocellulose (Protran BA85; Schleicher & Schuell). The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human APP+1 (AMY6 bleeding 050897; 1:1000) in Supermix (50 mm Tris, 2.5 g/liter gelatin, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.5% Triton-X-100, pH 7.4) or 22C11 (17Hilbich C. Monning U. Grund C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26571-26577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (1:100) in Supermix. Subsequently, the blots were washed 3× in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBS-T, pH 7.5; 65 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Dako; 1:1000 in Supermix) or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Dako; 1:1000 in Supermix) at room temperature for 1 h. After three final washings in TBS-T, the labeled proteins were visualized with Lumi-Light ECL (Roche Applied Science). Liquid phase pre-adsorption of the AMY6 antibody (1:1000 in Supermix) was performed by adding an excess of AMY6 peptide. The prestained molecular weight markers used are MultiMark® multicolored standard of Invitrogen and Rainbow Marker of Amersham Biosciences. Radioimmunoassay—Fifty microliters of cerebrospinal fluid was directly measured in the radioimmunoassay (RIA) in duplicate. Standard peptides and samples were diluted in RIA buffer (50 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 g/liter bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0). Fifty microliters of standard or sample was incubated at 4 °C for 48 h with 50 μl of antiserum (AMY6; 1:10,000) and 10 μl (10,000 cpm) of 125I-AMY6 peptide. AMY6 peptide was iodinated by the chloramine T method. To precipitate the antibody peptide/protein complex, 50 μl of cellulose coated with a secondary antibody against rabbit IgG (Saccel; IDS LTD, Boldon, UK) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 15 min, and the pellets were counted in a Cobra γ-counter for 5 min. The sensitivity of the RIA is 15 pg of APP+1 per 50 μl. Characteristics of APP + 1 RIA—The AMY6 peptide was iodinated and subsequently purified on a Sepharose G25 column to separate free 125I-sodium, non-iodinated AMY6, and 125I-AMY6. The binding capacity of five different bleedings of the AMY6 antibody and the pre-immune serum to 125I-AMY6 was tested. A maximum binding of 80% could be reached with an antibody dilution of 1:1000. A clear increase in binding capacity was observed between the first bleeding (170697) and the later bleedings of the AMY6 serum. Pre-immune serum did not bind to 125I-AMY6 peptide at all. All subsequent RIAs were done using AMY6 bleeding 050897. The optimal antibody-peptide binding for the APP+1 RIA was reached with AMY6 bleeding 050897 at a dilution of 1:20,000. We performed displacement curves by adding an increasing amount of non-labeled AMY6 peptide or recombinant His6-APP+1 to AMY6 (dilution 1:20,000, bleeding 050897; results not shown). The slopes of the graphs obtained with peptide and the recombinant protein are identical, indicating that this assay can reliably measure full-length APP+1. In our subsequent experiments we used the AMY6 peptide in the standard curves of the RIA. Statistical Analysis—The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance with multiple comparison of groups (20Conover W.J. Practical Nonparametric Statistics. 2d ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1980: 229-237Google Scholar) was used to test differences between groups (program developed by J.M. Ruijter (Department of Anatomy and Embryology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam). APP + 1 Is Secreted by Human Neuronal Cells—To determine whether APP+1 is a secretory protein like sAPPα and sAPPβ, we transfected human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells with the APP and APP+1 pcDNA3 constructs. The expression of APP and APP+1 was driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promotor to ensure high expression. The cells and their supernatants were harvested 1 day after transfection. Western blots of the cell pellets and the supernatants were probed with the 22C11 antibody (Fig. 2A) directed against residues 66–81 of APP as well as APP+1. The AMY6 antibody (Fig. 2B), directed against the unique C terminus of APP+1, was used to detect APP+1 specifically. The Western blot analysis revealed the presence of both APP (Fig. 2A, #) and APP+1 (Fig. 2A, *) in the cell lysate (Fig. 2A, lys) and the cell culture medium (Fig. 2A, med) with the 22C11 antibody. In addition, endogenous APP is visible in all transfection conditions (Fig. 2A, arrowheads). A second blot of the same experiment was probed with APP+1 specific antibody AMY6 and showed only staining of the APP+1 proteins (Fig. 2B, *) in the cell lysate (Fig. 2B, lys) and the cell culture medium (Fig. 2B, med). Recombinant APP (from the transfected cells; Fig. 2A, #), endogenous APP and sAPP (Fig. 2A, arrowheads) was stained with 22C11 and not at all with the APP+1-specific antibody AMY6. The intracellular APP+1 is present in two forms, probably reflecting the non-glycosylated and O-glycosylated forms of APP+1. Such a doublet has also been observed by others for APP695, and they also argue that the doublet consists of an O-glycosylated and non-O-glycosylated form (21Story E. Katz M. Brickman Y. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1779-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In addition, Hersberger et al. (16Hersberger M. Santiago-Garcia J. Patarroyo-White S. Yan J. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) have also discussed the O-glycosylation of APP+1. Only the higher band of APP+1 is present in the cell culture medium, which is likely to be the fully processed, glycosylated form of APP+1. This band does not run exactly at the same height as the higher APP+1 band in the cell pellet because of the presence of albumin in the cell culture medium. In the lanes of the mock transfected cells as well as the APP transfected cells, two bands, which represent proteins with an apparent mass between 50 and 60 kDa, reacted with the 22C11 antibody. These proteins might be degradation products of APP or N-terminal fragments. Because AMY6 does not react with these bands, it is excluded that these proteins represent endogenous APP+1. Quantification of APP + 1—The RIA developed to measure APP+1 in CSF was validated by analyzing temporal and frontal cortex homogenates of four non-demented controls and eight AD patients (Table I). The latter have a confirmed GA deletion in either exon 9 or exon 10 in part of the APP transcripts (4Van Leeuwen F.W. De Kleijn D.P.V. Van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In the cortex homogenates of AD patients a 3.4-fold increase in intracellular APP+1 levels could be measured compared with the non-demented control group (Fig. 3A). To establish the presence of APP+1 in CSF and determine the differences between non-demented controls and AD patients, we assayed post-mortem ventricular CSF collected by the Netherlands Brain Bank. In contrast with the data on the cortex homogenates, we measured significantly lower levels of APP+1 in CSF samples of AD patients (Fig. 3B). CSF of non-demented controls contained 3.4 times more APP+1. With respect to the age of the subject and pH of the CSF, there was no significant difference between the control subjects and the Alzheimer patients. The value of the pH of CSF is an indication of the agonal state of the patients (22Alafuzoff I. Winblad B. J. Neural Transm. Suppl. 1993; 39: 235-243PubMed Google Scholar, 23Ravid R. Van Zwieten E.J. Swaab D.F. Prog. Brain Res. 1992; 93: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). A significant difference between the groups was found in the post-mortem delay; however, no correlation was found between post-mortem delay and APP+1 levels or protein levels. Furthermore, a significant decrease in brain weight of AD patients, which is an inevitable characteristic of the disorder, as well as a significant decrease in CSF total protein content were observed (Table II).Table IDetermination of APP+1 in brain homogenates of non-demented controls and AD patientsCONADMann-Whitney p valueTotal number of patients48Male34Female14Age (years)61.575.50.306PMD (min)392.5217.50.027aSignificant statistical difference between non-demented controls and AD patients.pH6.596.560.349Brain weight (g)1332.511000.089APP+1 (ng/mg protein)0.752.550.042aSignificant statistical difference between non-demented controls and AD patients.a Significant statistical difference between non-demented controls and AD patients.

Open table in a new tab Western Analysis of APP + 1 in CSF—The nature of the APP+1 immunoreactivity in CSF was determined by a Western blot. First, we determined whether the AMY6 antibody, which is directed against the AMY6 peptide, will stain purified His6-APP+1 on a Western blot. This protein is produced in a prokaryotic expression system, and, therefore, no glycosylation of APP+1 takes place. Furthermore, six histidines are added to the N terminus, and the signal peptide sequence is not cleaved off from His6-APP+1. Consequently, His6-APP+1 (Fig 4A, lane 3) will run at a slightly higher molecular mass than the secreted endogenous APP+1 (∼50–60-kDa band indicated with an asterisk in Fig. 4B, lane 2). The same blot probed with a buffer without the first antibody or with pre-adsorbed AMY6 showed no signal at all (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). In human CSF of a non-demented control (NBB92-030, female, 78 year-old, ApoE 33), a banding pattern was observed after staining with the AMY6 antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 2). The band of ∼50–60 kDa (asterisk) is most likely the APP+1 band, because this band has been significantly reduced in the blot probed with pre-adsorbed antibody (Fig. 4B, lane 1). In agreement with the findings in the culture medium of the APP+1 transfected SH-SY5Y cells, only the fully processed form of APP+1 protein is secreted. Fig. 4C provides a direct comparison between His6-APP+1, APP+1 in lysate, and APP+1 in a cell culture medium of APP+1 transfected cells. On the same gel, the two different pre-stained molecular mass markers used in the study were loaded, i.e. in the left lane (Fig. 4C) with the Multimark® multi-colored standard of Invitrogen and in the right lane (Fig. 4C) with the Rainbow marker of Amersham Biosciences. It is clear from this blot that the several different forms of APP+1 all have an apparent molecular mass between 50 and 60 kDa. APP + 1 Levels in CSF and Association with Neuropathology—The analysis of APP+1 in CSF showed a particularly striking inverse correlation between the concentration of APP+1 in the CSF and the neuropathological stage of the patients, i.e. the Braak stages (24Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11766) Google Scholar). Braak staging of the autopsy brain material was performed previously by W. Kamphorst. Fig. 5A shows that a higher Braak stage, i.e. with more severe cortical Alzheimer changes, is strongly related to a decline in the amount of APP+1 in the CSF. No such correlation was found in total protein content, although a significant decrease was measured in the CSF samples of AD patients (Braak 4–6) compared with non-demented controls (Braak 0–2) (Fig. 5B). After correction for protein content of the CSF, the amount of APP+1 per milligram of total protein shows a rapid and significant decline in APP+1 levels between Braak stages 0 and 1, but the levels remain constant at higher Braak stages (Fig. 5C). These findings imply that measuring APP+1 levels in CSF indeed can be used as an ante-mortem test to diagnose early AD changes before the onset of clinical manifestation of the disease. In this study we demonstrate that the APP+1 protein is normally secreted by neuronal cell lines transfected with APP+1. Furthermore, we show that APP+1 is present in CSF of non-demented controls with no neuropathology and that the concentration of APP+1 is decreased in patients with AD pathology. In earlier studies we have shown that APP+1 accumulates in the neurons in the cortex and hippocampus of AD patients (4Van Leeuwen F.W. De Kleijn D.P.V. Van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), indicating that the neuronal secretion of APP+1 in these patients has stopped. This process of intraneuronal retention and accumulation of APP+1 already starts in clinically non-demented controls with initial neuropathology. 2F. W. Van Leeuwen, unpublished observations. Moreover, we show that the concentration of APP+1 in CSF is closely related to the grade of neurofibrillary pathology in AD patients. Even minor pathological changes are reflected in a decrease in the APP+1 level in CSF. Hence, the APP+1 RIA can potentially be used for diagnosing AD in patients with initial neuropathology. APP is a type I trans-membrane protein that is cleaved by secretases, resulting in secretory forms of APP that are either secreted by the constitutive (25Peraus G.C. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7714-7724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or, as a recent study suggests, by the regulated pathway (26Hook V.Y. Toneff T. Aaron W. Yasothornsrikul S. Bundey R. Reisine T. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 237-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Given that APP+1 consists of the first 329 N-terminal amino acids of APP and therefore contains the signal peptide moiety, we anticipated that APP+1 would also be secreted by neurons and could even be detected in CSF. In the present study, we show by transfecting human neuronal cells with APP+1 that APP+1 is indeed a secretory protein with an apparent molecular mass between 50 and 60 kDa. The calculated molecular mass of APP+1, however, is 38 kDa. Still, this difference in calculated and observed molecular mass is expected, because a similar deviant SDS-PAGE migration pattern has been observed for the several different splice forms of APP (27Weidemann A. König G. Bunke D. Fischer P. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Cell. 1989; 57: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The aspartate/glutamate-rich acidic region at amino acid positions 230–260 causes the aberrant migration pattern on the SDS-PAGE gel. In our earlier study (4Van Leeuwen F.W. De Kleijn D.P.V. Van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) on APP+1 in human brain homogenate, we have reported on a 38-kDa APP+1 band. In this study, we used a different APP+1 antibody (AMY1) to detect the protein on a Western blot. The antibody used in the present study (AMY6) is much more sensitive on a Western blot. By the current transfection studies we have proven that the observation of the 38 kDa band in the earlier study does not represent the full-length APP+1. It might be a C-terminal fragment of APP+1, similar to the 38 kDa band in Fig 4, A and B. Despite the observation that neuronal cells transfected with APP+1 secrete APP+1 readily, we were surprised to find APP+1 in the CSF of non-demented controls. Thus far we had only observed the presence of APP+1 mRNA in the hippocampus and cortex of AD and Down syndrome patients and the APP+1 protein in the neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles of these brain areas in AD and Down syndrome patients (4Van Leeuwen F.W. De Kleijn D.P.V. Van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 6Hol E.M. Neubauer A. De Kleijn D.P.V. Sluijs J.A. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Sonnemans M.A.F. Van Leeuwen F.W. Prog. Brain Res. 1998; 117: 379-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The failure to detect a GA deletion in the mRNA of APP in non-demented controls can be explained by the relatively low sensitivity of the immunoscreening assay we used in our earlier study (4Van Leeuwen F.W. De Kleijn D.P.V. Van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In the cDNAs from APP mRNA isolated from the cortex and hippocampus of AD brains, we found between 2 and 12 APP+1 immunopositive clones of 20,000. It is therefore conceivable that we missed the mutation in the two non-demented control patients we screened in that study. Recent extensive studies on the frequency of molecular misreading of APP in the cell lines and temporal cortex of non-demented control, AD, and Down syndrome patients showed that a low frequency of GA deletions in APP mRNA, i.e. 1:100,000, occur in all studied tissues. 3L. Gerez, A. de Haan, and R. Benne, unpublished observations. Furthermore, our group did report on the presence of dinucleotide deletions in mRNAs of ubiquitin B RNA isolated from the cortex of elderly non-demented controls, indicating that molecular misreading is not restricted to AD patients (4Van Leeuwen F.W. De Kleijn D.P.V. Van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Recent stainings of vibratome sections of the cortex and hippocampus of non-demented controls also showed that APP+1 immunoreactivity is present in beaded fibers in these brain areas. 4R. van Dijk, D. F. Fischer, J. A. Sluijs, M. A. F. Sonnemans, B. Hobo, L. Mercken, D. A. Mann, E. M. Hol, and F. W. van Leeuwen, submitted for publication. This immunocytochemical technique is more sensitive compared with the staining on paraffin sections that was applied in our initial study on APP+1 (4Van Leeuwen F.W. De Kleijn D.P.V. Van den Hurk H.H. Neubauer A. Sonnemans M.A.F. Sluijs J.A. Köycü S. Ramdjielal R.D.J. Salehi A. Martens G.J.M. Grosveld F.G. Burbach J.P.H. Hol E.M. Science. 1998; 279: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Moreover, with the vibratome technique we also observed APP+1 in the neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic fibers in plaques of clinically non-demented controls with initial neuropathology. Therefore, the accumulation of APP+1 in the neuropathological hallmarks of AD is likely to be caused by a deficiency in the secretion of this protein, given our present findings and the earlier publication of Hersberger et al. (16Hersberger M. Santiago-Garcia J. Patarroyo-White S. Yan J. Xu X. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 1308-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that APP+1 and the enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged APP+1 are secreted. The analysis of the CSF samples of non-demented controls and AD patients showed clearly that the APP+1 level was significantly decreased in neuropathologically confirmed AD patients (Braak score 4–6). The RIA technique to measure APP+1 is highly specific, because there is direct competition between endogenous APP+1 and iodinated-peptide for the same antibody. Fig. 4B shows that the APP+1 antibody used in this study, AMY6, recognized several different proteins on Western blot, but pre-adsorption with the same peptide as used in the RIA showed a diminished intensity of mainly a ∼50–60 kDa band, indicating that this band likely represents the APP+1 which is measured in the RIA. The decrease in APP+1 in the CSF of AD patients supports the idea that neuropathology is preceded by a deficiency in protein secretion by neurons. Also, other hormones and secretory proteins, such as melatonin (28Zhou J.-N. Liu R.-Y. Kamphorst W. Hofman M.A. Swaab D.F. J. Pineal Res. 2003; 35: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and sAPP (12Sennvik K. Fastbom J. Blomberg M. Wahlund L.O. Winblad B. Benedikz E. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), are decreased in CSF of AD patients. Another explanation for the drop in the concentration of APP+1 is that the enlargement of the ventricles may cause a subsequent dilution of CSF proteins, because the volume of ventricular CSF in AD patients has been shown to be twice as much as in non-demented controls (29Tanna N.K. Kohn M.I. Horwich D.N. Jolles P.R. Zimmerman R.A. Alves W.M. Alavi A. Radiology. 1991; 178: 123-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ventricular dilatation and reduced CSF production will presumably result in a progressive reduction in CSF turnover during aging (30May C. Kaye J.A. Atack J.R. Schapiro M.B. Friedland R.P. Rapoport S.I. Neurology. 1990; 40: 500-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An alternative reason for the reduced levels of APP+1 in the CSF of AD patients could, therefore, be the proteolytic breakdown of APP+1 in CSF. From the patients we analyzed, there is no information available on the degree of ventricular dilatation. Therefore, we decided to measure the total protein content of the CSF, which will provide information on the dilution of CSF and, therefore, these data might reflect the degree of ventricular dilatation. As can be observed in Fig. 5B, the protein content of CSF obtained from AD patients with Braak stage 4–6 is significantly less compared with that from the patients with Braak 0–2. It is also clear from Fig. 5 that dilution of the CSF is not the cause of the decrease in APP+1 levels. A strong argument in favor of a specific reduction of APP+1 secretion in patients with early AD changes comes from the Braak stage 1 group. In these controls less than half of the APP+1 levels of the Braak stage 0 group has been found (Fig. 5A), but no decline in total protein was observed (Fig. 5B). It is highly unlikely that a ventricular dilatation by more than a factor two would already have occurred in these non-demented controls with only very mild AD changes. The clinical diagnosis of probable and possible AD is largely based on neuropsychological examinations. Although the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis has improved, a definite diagnosis still can only be made after autopsy (1Cummings J.L. Cole G. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 2335-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). A biomarker that can aid the clinical diagnosis and even detect early neuropathological changes would be extremely valuable (31Teunissen C.E. de Vente J. Steinbusch H.W. De Bruijn C. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Klunk W.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 33Khachaturian Z.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34Papassotiropoulos A. Hock C. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 513-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this respect, CSF markers are expected to be useful, because the biochemical processes in the brain are likely to be reflected by the proteins that are present in the CSF. Aβ42 and sAPP levels have often been reported to be decreased in CSF of AD patients, whereas Aβ40 levels were unchanged. The former finding also indicates that there is an initial problem with protein secretion in neurons. Another protein that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD is the microtubule-associated protein tau (35Spillantini M.G. Goedert M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 428-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The level of tau protein is increased in CSF of AD patients (36Sjogren M. Davidsson P. Tullberg M. Minthon L. Wallin A. Wikkelso C. Granerus A.K. Vanderstichele H. Vanmechelen E. Blennow K. J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatry. 2001; 70: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and patients with mild cognitive impairments (37De Leon M.J. Segal S. Tarshish C.Y. DeSanti S. Zinkowski R. Mehta P.D. Convit A. Caraos C. Rusinek H. Tsui W. Saint Louis L.A. DeBernardis J. Kerkman D. Qadri F. Gary A. Lesbre P. Wisniewski T. Poirier J. Davies P. Neurosci. Lett. 2002; 333: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), probably reflecting neuronal death. Recently, it has been shown that altered tau and Aβ42 concentration can help to diagnose AD patients in subjects with mild cognitive impairments (38Riemenschneider M. Lautenschlager N. Wagenpfeil S. Diehl J. Drzezga A. Kurz A. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 1729-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In post-mortem ventricular CSF it has been shown previously that the melatonin concentration is closely correlated to the Braak stage. In patients with more severe neuropathology a lower concentration of melatonin was measured (28Zhou J.-N. Liu R.-Y. Kamphorst W. Hofman M.A. Swaab D.F. J. Pineal Res. 2003; 35: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), which is in agreement with our findings. In conclusion, the measurement of AD-related proteins in CSF, including APP+1, can be of great use in improving the clinical diagnostic accuracy of AD (24Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11766) Google Scholar), which is, at present, only definite after autopsy. In this manuscript we show that APP+1 is a ∼50–60 kDa secretory protein. Furthermore, we provide evidence that APP+1 is already retained in neurons in the brains of non-demented controls with initial AD pathology. This retention probably reflects an impaired capacity of protein secretion and other early pathological changes in affected neurons or dying neurons. Measuring levels of secretory proteins, like APP+1, in CSF can help to reveal these early deficits in the function of neurons. Above all, the strong correlation between APP+1 levels in CSF and observed pathological changes could help in diagnosing AD at an early stage.

Bacterial toxins (e.g. bacteriocins) and viruses (bacteriophages) targeting Gram-negative bacteria typically bind to outer membrane proteins. Bacterial E-colicins target Escherichia coli by binding to the outer membrane cobalamin transporter BtuB. Colicins are tripartite molecules possessing receptor-binding, translocation, and toxin domains connected by long coiled-coil α-helices. Surprisingly, the crystal structure of colicin E3 does not possess a recognizable globular fold in its receptor-binding domain. We hypothesized that the binding epitope of enzymatic E-colicins is a short loop connecting the two α-helices that comprise the coiled-coil region and that this flanking coiled-coil region serves to present the loop in a binding-capable conformation. To test this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized a 34-residue peptide (E-peptide-1) corresponding to residues Ala366–Arg399 of the helix-loop-helix region of colicin E3. Cysteines placed near the ends of the peptide (I372C and A393C) enabled crosslinking for reduction of conformational entropy and formation of a peptide structure that would present the loop epitope. A fluorescent analog was also made for characterization of binding by measurement of fluorescence polarization. Our analysis shows the following. (i) E-peptide-1 is predominantly random coil in aqueous solution, but disulfide bond formation increases its α-helical content in both aqueous buffer and solvents that promote helix formation. (ii) Fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 binds to purified BtuB in a calcium-dependent manner with a Kd of 43.6 ± 4.9 nm or 2370 ± 670 nm in the presence or absence of calcium, respectively. (iii) In the presence of calcium, cyanocobalamin (CN-Cbl) displaces E-peptide-1 with a nanomolar inhibition constant (Ki = 78.9 ± 5.6 nm). We conclude that the BtuB binding sites for cobalamins and enzymatic E-colicins are overlapping but inequivalent and that the distal loop and (possibly) the short α-helical flanking regions are sufficient for high affinity binding. Toxins and viruses often initiate their attacks by binding to specific proteins on the surfaces of target cells.

A critical first step for the action of many toxins and viruses is binding to proteins or other molecules at the external surface of the target cell. Examples of this process for eukaryotic targets include bacterial toxins and virulence factors that can bind to integrins or other eukaryotic receptors (1Knodel L.A. Celli J. Finlay B.B. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), as well as the human immunodeficiency virus that utilizes chemokine receptors (2Dragic T. Litwin V. Allaway G.P. Martin S.R. Huang Y. Nagashima K.A. Cayanan C. Maddon P.J. Koup R.A. Moore J.P. Paxton W.A.

Wong-Staal F. Steimer K.S. Engelman E.G. Nature. 1986; 323: 725-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) as co-receptors. This process also occurs in the microbial world, with bacterial toxins (e.g. bacteriocins) and bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) binding to surface proteins of susceptible bacteria. Colicins are bacteriocins produced by and active against strains of Escherichia coli and closely related bacteria (4Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B. Schendel S.L. Deriy B.N. Cohen F.S. Elkins P.A. Stauffacher C.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Colicins bind to outer membrane proteins such as porins and transporters for cobalamins, siderophores, and nucleosides (4Lazdunski C.J. Bouveret E. Rigal A. Journet L. Lloubes R. Benedetti H. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Cramer W.A. Heymann J.B. Schendel S.L. Deriy B.N. Cohen F.S. Elkins P.A. Stauffacher C.V. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

E-colicins, a group of nine closely related colicins called ColE1–9, 1The abbreviations used are: ColE1–9, E-colicin 1–9 (ColE1, ColE2, etc.); CN-Cbl, cyanocobalamin; R domain, receptor-binding domain.1The abbreviations used are: ColE1–9, E-colicin 1–9 (ColE1, ColE2, etc.); CN-Cbl, cyanocobalamin; R domain, receptor-binding domain. bind to the E. coli outer membrane cobalamin transporter BtuB (8Heller K. Mann B.J. Kadner R.J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 896-903Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of BtuB (9Chimento D.P. Mohanty A.K. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) consists of a 22-stranded β-barrel with an amino-terminal hatch domain (Fig. 1, a and b). Cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12, CN-Cbl), a common substrate for BtuB, acts as an inhibitor for E-colicin binding and activity in vivo (10Di Masi D.R. White J.C. Schnaitman C.A. Bradbeer C. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 506-513Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Cavard D. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 116: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The E-colicins belong to one of the following three cytotoxic classes: (i) membrane depolarizing (or pore forming) colicins such as ColE1; (ii) DNases such as ColE2, ColE7, ColE8, and ColE9; and (iii) RNases such as ColE3, ColE4, ColE5, and ColE6 (7James R. Kleanthous C. Moore G.R. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The enzymatic colicins, ColE2–9, are nearly identical in sequence except for the domains that encode their enzymatic activity. The lethal action of colicins is executed by three consecutive stages that involve the following: (i) binding to an outer-membrane receptor protein; (ii) transport across the cell envelope; and (iii) biochemical interaction with its target in the cell. These three steps are mediated by three separate parts of the protein, namely a receptor-binding (R) domain located in the central part of the primary sequence, an N-terminal translocation (T) domain, and a carboxyl-terminal catalytic or channel-forming (C) domain, respectively. These domains are linked by long α-helices that form a coiled-coil region. The first intact colicin structure, colicin Ia (12Wiener M. Freymann D. Ghosh P. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), illustrates clearly this tripartite architecture (Fig. 1c). The first (and to date, only) intact E-colicin structure, colicin E3 (13Soelaiman S. Jakes K. Wu N. Li C. Shoham M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), lacks a clearly identifiable globular R domain (Fig. 1d). Where is the R domain in enzymatic E-colicins? The two long α-helices forming the coiled-coil region of ColE3 are linked by a short, seven-residue “hairpin” (Ala379–Gly385), and Soelaiman et al. (13Soelaiman S. Jakes K. Wu N. Li C. Shoham M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) predicted that this loop binds to BtuB. Prior to the elucidation of the ColE3 structure, analysis of amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs of ColE9 localized E-colicin R domain properties to a 76-residue region (Fig. 1e); this polypeptide bound specifically to BtuB and inhibited the growth of a CN-Cbl-dependent strain of E. coli (14Penfold C.N. Garinot-Schneider C. Hemmings A.M. Moore G.R. Kleanthous C. James R. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Subsequent solution NMR studies of this construct, interpreted in the context of the ColE3 structure, indicate that it is a helical hairpin structure with multiple conformers in slow exchange and that the connecting loop is flexible (15Boetzel R. Collins E.S. Clayden N.J. Kleanthous C. James R. Moore G.R. Faraday Discuss. 2003; 122: 145-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Other helix-loop-helix ColE3 domain constructs, 60–135 residues in length, have also been shown to bind specifically to BtuB (16Zakharov S.D. Bano S. Zhalnina M. Cramer W.A. Biophys. J. 2003; 84 (abstr.): 324aGoogle Scholar, 17Bano S. Zakharov S.D. Zhalnina M. Lindeberg M. Shoham M. Cramer W.A. Biophys. J. 2002; 82 (abstr.): 554aGoogle Scholar). We hypothesized that the essential binding epitope of the enzymatic E-colicins is this short connecting loop, and the coiled-coil region functions to present this loop in a conformation that is binding competent. Therefore, much of this coiled-coil should be dispensable. We used structure-based design and then synthesized and characterized a 34-residue peptide of ColE3 (E-peptide-1, Fig. 1f). E-peptide-1 binds with high affinity to purified BtuB, thus supporting the idea that the coiled-coil is primarily a scaffold for epitope presentation. The calcium-dependence of E-peptide-1 binding and its competitive displacement by the CN-Cbl suggest that enzymatic E-colicins and the cobalamin substrates of BtuB possess overlapping but inequivalent binding sites. Peptide Design—The design of E-peptide-1 started with the ColE3 wild type sequence Ala366–Arg399. Because cyclization can significantly stabilize peptide tertiary structure (18Hocart S.J. Jain R. Murphy W.A. Taylor J.E. Coy D.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 1863-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 19Tam J.P. Wu C. Yang J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3289-3300Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) by decreasing conformational entropy, a disulfide linkage was engineered. Using SwissPDB Viewer (20Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9398) Google Scholar) with the ColE3 structure as a template, all possible Cys-Cys disulfides were modeled and energy minimized. Six possible disulfide cross-linked peptides that had cysteine residues with normal Cα-Cβ-S and Cβ-S-S dihedral angles of 110o and 105o, respectively, and normal C-S and S-S distances of 1.55 Å and 1.90 Å, respectively, were identified. These variants all had backbone tertiary structures that were very similar to the native structure, with maximum atomic deviations of ∼0.3 Å in the vicinity of the disulfide bond. From these six possibilities, F378C/W390C, I372C/A393C, D381C/H387C, A368C/A397C, F375C/W390C, and F375C/M389C, two (I372C/A393C and A368C/A397C) were nearly isovolumetric and did not alter the total charge of the sequence. From among these two, I372C/A393C was selected because it is closest to the native hydrophobicity (21Wimley W.C. Creamer T.P. White S.H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5109-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and because it is located in the middle of the coiled-coil where the crosslink is expected to have the greatest stabilizing effect (Fig. 1f). Peptide Synthesis and Purification—E-peptide-1 was synthesized by N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry (22Grant G.A. Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide. W. H. Freeman., New York1992Google Scholar, 23Atherton E. Sheppard R.C. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. IRL Press, Oxford1989Google Scholar) using an Applied Biosystems Pioneer synthesizer. The solid support was PEG-PS-PAL resin (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with a loading of 0.25 mmol/g. The groups pbf and Trt (22Grant G.A. Synthetic Peptides: A User's Guide. W. H. Freeman., New York1992Google Scholar) were used for the critical side-chain protection of Arg and Cys, respectively. After observing large amounts of pbf adducts on Trp in a preliminary synthesis, Boc-protection of the Trp side-chain was used to prevent its recurrence. Protecting groups were cleaved efficiently using a 2-h treatment with 90% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% thioanisole, 3% ethanedithiol, and 2% anisole. Cleavage was performed in a dark N2 atmosphere with the first 15 min of cleavage carried out at 0 °C and the remainder at room temperature. Cleaved peptide was filtered from the resin, dried immediately under a stream of nitrogen, and then lyophilized repeatedly from glacial acetic acid. Lyophilized E-peptide-1 was reduced with aqueous dithiothreitol and then partially purified with PolyCat A cation exchange resin (Western Analytical, Murietta, CA). Peptide was bound to the PolyCat A resin, and then the dithiothreitol and other contaminants were removed by extensively washing the resin with water and isopropanol. Finally, the pure peptide was eluted from the resin with 45% acetic acid. Mass spectrometry on this material gave the mass of 3877 ± 2 Da (predicted mass, 3876.4 Da). There were no major contaminants and no evidence that the acid-labile Asp-Pro bond (24Piszkiewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1970; 40: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) had been cleaved. Reduced E-peptide-1, which is highly soluble in water, was oxidized at 20 mg/ml for 24 h in 10% Me2SO/water (25Tam J. Wu C.-R. Liu W. Zhang J.-W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 6657-6662Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Oxidized peptide was analyzed with mass spectrometry, and no evidence of crosslinked dimers or higher oligomers was found. We verified that the peptides were cyclized by cleaving the Asp-Pro bond at residue 16 in formic acid (24Piszkiewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1970; 40: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and then using high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to show that the resulting single species was separated into two peptide species of the expected masses of 1838 and 2058 Da only upon disulfide bond reduction. Final purification of the cyclized E-peptide-1 peptide was done with C18 reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Linear E-peptide-1 was made by reduction with dithiothreitol and S-carboxyamidomethylation with iodoacetamide. Fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 was made by labeling the peptide's amino terminus with fluorescein succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) while the peptide was still attached to the solid support and while its lysine side-chains were still protected. Cleavage, deprotection, oxidation, and purification of the labeled peptide were done as described above. CD Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectra of oxidized and reduced E-peptide-1 peptide were collected from samples in a 0.1-mm path length quartz cuvette using a circular dichroism spectrometer (JASCO Model 810). Spectra were collected from 300 to 180 nm with 1-nm step size, 1-nm bandwidth, and at a rate of 10 nm/min. Spectra were recorded at 20–40 μm peptide in distilled water or water that contained 30 or 60% trifluoroethanol, a helix-promoting solvent (26Nelson J.W. Kallenbach N.R. Proteins. 1986; 1: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) Fluorescence Polarization Binding Assays—BtuB was expressed and purified as described previously (27Chimento D.P. Mohanty A.K. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The peak fractions after the final anion exchange purification step were passed over PD-10 desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences) into assay buffer (30 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 0.6% n-octyl tetraoxyethylene (C8E4; Anatrace, Maumee, OH)). This assay buffer contains 1.6 μm free calcium as determined by fluorescence-ratio analysis of Fura-2 (Molecular Probes). BtuB concentration was determined by measurement of A 280 and use of an extinction coefficient of 198,329 M–1 cm–1 as determined by quantitative amino acid analysis (W. M. Keck Facility, Yale University, New Haven, CT). E-peptide-1 concentration was determined in a similar way using an extinction coefficient ϵ280 = 7,253 M–1 cm–1. Fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 concentration was measured by absorbance spectroscopy using an extinction coefficient ϵ498 = 88,000 M–1 cm–1 and used at a concentration of 5–6nm in the assays. The concentration of CN-Cbl was estimated by absorbance using A361(1%1cm)=204 (28Budavari S. The Merck Index: An Encyclopedia of Chemicals, Drugs and Biologicals. 12th ed. Whitehouse Station, NJ1996: 1710Google Scholar). Fluorescence polarization (P) at 20 °C was measured with a Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization instrument (PanVera, Madison, WI) with filters at 490 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission). Fluorescence polarization (P) values were converted to anisotropy (A) values by the equation A = 2P/(3 – P); anisotropy of the free peptide was typically ∼0.1. Data were fitted using KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) to the equation A = A f + ((A b – A f)[protein]/(Kd + [protein])), with A f and A b representing the anisotropy of the free and bound peptides, respectively. Competitive binding studies were performed using BtuB and fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 concentrations at which >90% of the peptide was bound to BtuB. Competing ligands (CN-Cbl or unlabeled E-peptide-1) were added, and the change in P with ligand titration was measured. Anisotropy data were fitted to the equation A = A f + ((A b – A f)[I]/(IC50 + [I])), where A f, A b, and I are anisotropy of free competing ligands, anisotropy of the bound competing ligands, and total concentration of the competing ligands, respectively. The IC50 value of each competing ligand was converted to Ki by the equation Ki = (0.5 B)(IC50)(Kd)/((L T R T) + 0.5B(–R T – L T + 0.5B – Kd)), where B, IC50, L T, and R T are bound fluorescent ligand, concentration of competitor at 50% inhibition, total fluorescent ligand, and total protein concentration respectively (29Kenakin T. Pharmacological Analysis of Drug/Receptor Interaction. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, New York1997: 242-288Google Scholar). The α-Helical Content of E-peptide-1 Increases with Disulfide Bond Formation—CD spectra are shown in Fig. 2. Reduced, linear E-peptide-1 is random coil with a broad minimum centered at 200 nm and essentially zero ellipticity in the α-helical region between 210 and 225 nm (30Johnson Jr., W.C. Proteins. 1990; 7: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Oxidized disulfide-linked E-peptide-1 has more ordered secondary structure in water as seen by a shift in the minimum up to 204 nm, a crossover to a positive peak at 190 nm, and measurable ellipticity in the α-helical region. Disulfide-linked E-peptide-1 contains about 10% helix in water based upon the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. In the presence of 60% trifluoroethanol, a helix-promoting solvent, the helical content of disulfide-linked E-peptide-1 increases to ∼40%, whereas reduced E-peptide-1 remains low at ∼10%. E-peptide-1 Binds to BtuB with a Calcium-dependent Nanomolar Affinity—Fluorescence polarization binding isotherms of fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 are shown in Fig. 3, and equilibrium binding constants Kd are listed in Table I. A single site binding model adequately fits the observed data. In the presence of 100 μm EGTA, fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 binds with only micromolar affinity (Kd = 2370 ± 670 nm; n = 4). Omission of EGTA and the addition of 20 μm CaCl2 to the assay buffer increases binding affinity dramatically by >50-fold (Kd = 43.6 ± 4.9 nm; n = 4). The affinity decreases slightly, Kd = 73.9 ± 8.3 nm (n = 4) in the standard assay buffer that contains 1.6 μm free calcium.Table IEquilibrium binding constants of fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 and competitive inhibitors CN-Cbl and E-peptide-1BufferKd (Fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1)Ki (CN-Cbl)Ki (E-peptide-1)nmnmnmStandard assay buffer (1.6 μm CaCl2)73.9 ± 8.3 (n = 4)90.4 ± 10.4 (n = 3)99.5 ± 19.8 (n = 3)Standard assay buffer + 20 μm CaCl243.6 ± 4.9 (n = 4)78.9 ± 5.6 (n = 4)49.9 ± 21.4 (n = 4)Standard assay buffer + 100 μm EGTA2370 ± 670 (n = 4)No binding observed (n = 2)2620 ± 780 (n = 2) Open table in a new tab CN-Cbl, a Substrate for BtuB, Displaces Bound E-peptide-1 in the Presence of Calcium—The BtuB substrate CN-Cbl is able to displace competitively bound fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1. Fluorescence polarization competitive binding isotherms are shown in Fig. 4a, and equilibrium inhibition constants Ki are listed in Table I. In the presence of 100 μm EGTA, CN-Cbl up to a maximum assay concentration of 66 μm is unable to displace bound fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1. A single site competitive binding model adequately fits the other observed data. The omission of EGTA and the addition of 20 μm CaCl2 to the assay buffer enables CN-Cbl to now displace bound fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 with a nanomolar inhibition constant (Ki = 78.9 ± 5.6 nm; n = 4). In the standard assay buffer that contains 1.6 μm free calcium, Ki increases slightly to 90.4 ± 10.4 nm (n = 3). The difference between these two values is not statistically significant. The ability of unlabeled E-peptide-1 to displace fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 was included as a positive control and to determine the effect, if any, of the fluorescent moiety upon binding (Fig. 4b). In contrast to competition by CN-Cbl, unlabeled E-peptide is able to displace bound fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 in the presence of 100 μm EGTA, although with a micromolar inhibition constant (Ki = 2620 ± 780 nm; n = 2). Omission of EGTA and addition of 20 μm CaCl2 to the assay buffer increases inhibition dramatically by >50-fold (Ki = 49.9 ± 21.4 nm; n = 4). The inhibition constant increases slightly (Ki = 99.5 ± 19.8 nm; n = 3), in the standard assay buffer. We successfully used the crystal structure of ColE3 (13Soelaiman S. Jakes K. Wu N. Li C. Shoham M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1053-1062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) as a template for design and construction of a minimal receptor-binding domain, E-peptide-1, that binds to the outer membrane cobalamin transporter BtuB with nanomolar affinity. This result supports the hypothesis that the primary binding epitope of enzymatic E-colicins is a short loop connecting the two α-helices that comprise the coiled-coil region and (possibly) includes relatively short segments of this flanking coiled-coil region. In the colicin binding event, the main function of the coiled-coil region is to form a scaffold for presentation of the loop epitope in a binding-competent conformation. Two peptide/protein design criteria were applied. First, minimizing the length of the peptide while maintaining at least two to three turns of each of the α-helices flanking the putative loop epitope. Second, substituting two cysteines into the wild type peptide sequence to enable formation of a disulfide crosslink for minimization of conformational entropy. Based on these criteria, we selected the 34-residue peptide E-peptide-1 (corresponding to Ala366– Arg399, with cysteine substitutions I372C and A393C (Fig. 1f). The E-peptide-1 sequence, in the context of the ColE3 crystal structure, is ∼75% helical. In contrast, disulfide-linked E-peptide-1 is only ∼10% helical in aqueous solvents. However, the helical content increases to ∼40% in helix-promoting solvents. Critically, the helical content of reduced and S-carboxy-amidomethylated E-peptide-1, near zero in water, did not change in helix-promoting solvents. Although synthetic E-peptide-1 possesses less secondary structure than when its sequence is present within the entire ColE3 protein, the isolated peptide can form α-helical structure under the appropriate environmental conditions; these conditions may include an induced-fit mechanism upon binding to BtuB. Importantly, this structuring is significantly enhanced, i.e. ΔGstructure is more favorable, when the disulfide crosslink is in place. Calcium is necessary for high affinity binding of CN-Cbl to BtuB, with a 50–100-fold decrease in affinity when calcium is depleted (31Bradbeer C. Reynolds P.R. Bauler G.M. Fernandez M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2520-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal structures of BtuB show that the addition of calcium induces an ordering of extracellular loops of the β-barrel and indicate a direct structural role for these ions in high affinity CN-Cbl binding (9Chimento D.P. Mohanty A.K. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). We observe an analogous calcium-dependent binding of E-peptide-1. Binding of fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 in the absence of calcium is ∼50-fold weaker than in the presence of 20 μm calcium; competitive displacement of fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 by E-peptide-1 is ∼50-fold less effective (Table I). The apparent Kd of calcium binding to BtuB in isolated outer membranes is 30 nm (31Bradbeer C. Reynolds P.R. Bauler G.M. Fernandez M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2520-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, 20 μm calcium is saturating. In competition binding experiments, CN-Cbl displaces E-peptide-1 with a nanomolar inhibition constant in the presence of calcium but cannot displace the peptide in calcium-depleted buffers. These two observations, a calcium dependence of E-peptide binding (like that of CN-Cbl binding) and displacement of E-peptide by CN-Cbl, indicate that the binding sites of cobalamins and enzymatic E-colicins are similar. However, the inhibition constant (Ki = 78.9 ± 5.6 nm; n = 4) for CN-Cbl to displace fluorescein-labeled E-peptide-1 from BtuB is 50–250-fold larger than reported Kd values for binding of CN-Cbl to BtuB (27Chimento D.P. Mohanty A.K. Kadner R.J. Wiener M.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 31Bradbeer C. Reynolds P.R. Bauler G.M. Fernandez M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2520-2523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result, that Ki ≫ Kd for CN-Cbl interaction with BtuB, implies that the binding sites for cobalamins and enzymatic E-colicins overlap but are not equivalent. Chemical modification experiments suggest that the ion channel-forming E-colicin, ColE1, binds differently to BtuB than the enzymatic E-colicins ColE2 and ColE3 (32Šmarda J. Macholan L. Folia Microbiol. 2000; 45: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This may reflect the different killing mechanisms of these two types of colicins. Following the binding event, enzymatic E-colicins are transported across both the outer and inner membranes in a process still rather poorly understood (33Cao Z. Klebba P.E. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 399-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).
