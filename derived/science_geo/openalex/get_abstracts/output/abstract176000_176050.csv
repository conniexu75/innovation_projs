https://openalex.org/W2163188200,"Cancers arise owing to the accumulation of mutations in critical genes that alter normal programmes of cell proliferation, differentiation and death. As the first stage of a systematic genome-wide screen for these genes, we have prioritized for analysis signalling pathways in which at least one gene is mutated in human cancer. The RAS RAF MEK ERK MAP kinase pathway mediates cellular responses to growth signals. RAS is mutated to an oncogenic form in about 15% of human cancer. The three RAF genes code for cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases that are regulated by binding RAS. Here we report BRAF somatic missense mutations in 66% of malignant melanomas and at lower frequency in a wide range of human cancers. All mutations are within the kinase domain, with a single substitution (V599E) accounting for 80%. Mutated BRAF proteins have elevated kinase activity and are transforming in NIH3T3 cells. Furthermore, RAS function is not required for the growth of cancer cell lines with the V599E mutation. As BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase that is commonly activated by somatic point mutation in human cancer, it may provide new therapeutic opportunities in malignant melanoma."

Covalent modifications of the histone proteins that comprise the nucleosome alter chromatin structure and have major effects on gene expression. Methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 by COMPASS is required for silencing of genes located near chromosome telomeres and within the rDNA (Krogan, N. J, Dover, J., Khorrami, S., Greenblatt, J.

Y., Winston, F., and Allis, C. D. (2001) Genes. Dev. 15, 3286–3295). To learn about the mechanism of histone methylation, we surveyed the genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for genes necessary for this process. By analyzing ∼4800 mutant strains, each deleted for a different non-essential gene, we discovered that the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6 is required for methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3. Ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 123 is the signal for the methylation of histone H3, which leads to silencing of genes located near telomeres.

It is commonly understood that oxidants serve mainly to kill bacteria and prevent wound infection. We tested the hypothesis that oxidants generated at the wound site promote dermal wound repair. We observed that H2O2 potently induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in human keratinocytes. Deletion mutant studies with a VEGF promoter construct revealed that a GC-rich sequence from bp −194 to −50 of the VEGF promoter is responsible for the H2O2 response. It was established that at μm concentrations oxidant induces VEGF expression and that oxidant-induced VEGF expression is independent of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 and dependent on Sp1 activation. To test the effect of NADPH oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species on wound healing in vivo, Rac1 gene transfer was performed to dermal excisional wounds left to heal by secondary intention. Rac1 gene transfer accelerated wound contraction and closure. Rac1 overexpression was associated with higher VEGF expression both in vivo as well in human keratinocytes. Interestingly, Rac1 gene therapy was associated with a more well defined hyperproliferative epithelial region, higher cell density, enhanced deposition of connective tissue, and improved histological architecture. Overall, the histological data indicated that Rac1 might be an important stimulator of various aspects of the repair process, eventually enhancing the wound-healing process as a whole.

Invest. 1973; 52: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that at low concentrations ROS may serve as signaling messengers in the cell and regulate numerous signal transduction and gene expression processes (2Sen, C.

Previous studies from our laboratories have reported that in the wound site ROS may promote wound angiogenesis by inducing VEGF expression in wound-related cells such as keratinocytes and macrophages (6Sen C.K.

Specifics of the signaling path involved in ROS-induced VEGF expression remain unknown, however. The Rac GTPase belongs to the rho family of small GTP binding proteins, and its role in the production of ROS in phagocytic cells such as neutrophils is well established (9Heyworth P.G. Knaus U.G. Settleman J. Curnutte J.T. Bokoch G.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Rac proteins are essential for the assembly of the plasma membrane NADPH oxidase that is responsible for the transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen leading to the production of superoxide anions during respiratory burst. Rac proteins, in particular Rac1, serve a similar function in nonphagocytic cells (10Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J.

First, characterize the transcriptional control of H2O2-inducible VEGF expression in human keratinocytes. Second, we sought to examine whether Rac1 overexpression influences inducible VEGF expression in keratinocytes. To test the hypothesis that ROS promotes wound repair, a murine secondary-intention wound-healing model was employed to investigate whether Rac1 gene transfer regulates wound contraction and closure.

VEGF protein expression by keratinocytes was determined using an ELISA approach described previously (6Sen C.K. Khanna S. Venojarvi M. Trikha P. Ellison E.C. Hunt T.K. Roy S. Am. J.

Cells were then permeabilized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% Triton X-100, and nonspecific antibody binding was blocked. VEGF expression was detected using anti-goat-hVEGF (1:50 dilution; R&D Systems). To enable fluorescence detection, cells were incubated with anti-goat-IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Santa Cruz, San Diego, CA) secondary antibody (1:100 dilution). The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probe). Total RNA was isolated from cells with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). The mRNA were detected from total cell RNA by RNase protection assay utilizing DNA templates from BD PharMingen (BD RiboQuantTM Ribonuclease Protection Assay System, BD PharMingen, San Diego, CA) (6Sen C.K.

VEGF-A (splice variants VEGF206, VEGF189, and VEGF165), VEGF-B (splice variants VEGF-B186 and VEGF-B167), VEGF-C, and VEGF-D were detected by reverse transcription-PCR using commercially available primer pairs (R&D Systems) and previously described routine protocol (6Sen C.K.

HaCaT cells were transiently transfected with the VEGF-Luc and Sp1-Luc constructs using SuperFect (Qiagen) reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 18 h of transfection, the cells were activated for 4–6 h with H2O2.Luciferase reporter activity was determined using a commercial kit (Stratagene). To block Sp1 interaction to its specific DNA-binding sites HaCaT cells were incubated with 100 nm mithramycin (Sigma) 2 h prior to activation of the cells with H2O2. Following 18 h of seeding, HaCaT cells were transiently transfected with either the empty expression plasmid pEXV or the expression plasmid pEXVracV12 (constitutively active Rac1) using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen). The cells were maintained in regular culture condition for 24 h to allow for protein expression. For Rac1 immunoblot, cytosolic protein extract of cells transiently transfected with pEXV or pEXVRac1V12 plasmids were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Rac1 antibody (1:1000 dilution; Upstate Biotech, Lake Placid, NY). Using standard Western blot techniques we were not available to get a high-quality resolution of bands. Instead, we labeled cellular proteins with 35S (18Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated, and autoradiography was performed as described previously (18Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). GSH and GSSG were simultaneously detected from wound edge tissues using a HPLC-coulometric electrode array detector (Coularray Detector, model 5600 with 12 channels; ESA Inc., Chelmsford, MA). For extraction, wound edge tissues were pulverized in liquid nitrogen and then homogenized in 5% wt/v m-phosphoric acid using a Teflon homogenizer. The samples were snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until the HPLC assay. On the day of HPLC assay, samples were quickly thawed on ice and centrifuged (12,000 × g, 5 min) at 4 °C. Supernatants were collected and filtered through a 0.2-μm filter. The filtrate was immediately injected to HPLC. GSH and GSSH were separated using a C18 column and the following mobile phase: 50 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.5 mm octanosulphonic acid, and 3% acetonitrile at pH 2.7 (19Sen C.K. Roy S. Khanna S. Packer L. Meth. Enzymol. 1999; 299: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The coulometric electrode array offers several advantages over conventional single-channel detectors (20Roy S. Venojarvi M. Khanna S. Sen C.K. Meth. Enzymol. 2002; 352: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Using a progressively increasing oxidative array of 12 electrodes, compounds can be made to react at three consecutive sensors. The upstream electrode oxidizes a small portion of the analyte, the second dominant electrode oxidizes the bulk of the analyte, and the downstream electrode oxidizes the remainder. A particular standard eluting at a given retention time will always provide a predictable response across these three electrodes. The ratio of the response across these three electrodes remains constant and is referred to as ratio accuracy. The comparison of ratio accuracy of standard versus sample is powerful and an immediate indicator of peak purity. Compared with standard, lower ratio accuracy in sample will indicate the presence of a co-elutant. Male BALB/c mice (n = 10; 4–6 weeks of age) were used. Two 8 × 16-mm full-thickness excisional wounds (6Sen C.K. Khanna S. Venojarvi M. Trikha P. Ellison E.C. Hunt T.K. Roy S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1821-H1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) were placed on the dorsal skin, equidistant from the midline and adjacent to the four limbs (see Fig. 9A). When required, the animals were killed and cutaneous wound edges (1–1.5 mm) were harvested. Each of the two wounds was topically treated once daily (days 0–5) with either empty plasmid (pEXV) or expression plasmid pEXVracV12 (constitutively active Rac1) (21Yu W.H. Kashani-Sabet M. Liggitt D. Moore D. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 370-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Twenty-five microliters of naked plasmid DNA (10 μg) in sterile Tris-EDTA, pH 8.0, (TE) were administered onto the wound area and spread evenly using the pipette tip. The applied DNA was allowed to completely air dry on the treated skin, which took ∼10 min. Plasmid amplification and purification were performed using standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). To study the effect of Rac1 gene therapy on endothelial cell response, transgenic mice (FVB/N-TgN-TIE2GFP) were wounded (n = 3) as described above. This strain expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the direction of the endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (Tie2) promoter. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Lab Animal Care and Use Committee of the Ohio State University, Columbus, OH. Imaging of wounds was performed between days 0–14 of wounding using a digital camera (Mavica FD91, Sony). The wound area was determined using WoundMatrixTM software. Collagen content of wound edge tissue was assessed by determining the amount of hydroxyproline (23Brown S. Worsfold M. Sharp C. BioTechniques. 2001; 30: 38-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Frozen wound tissue was pulverized under liquid nitrogen and then hydrolyzed in 1 ml of 5n HCl overnight at 110 °C. The reaction was neutralized with 2.5 n NaOH. The hydroxyproline assay was done in a 96-well plate by adding 100 μl of oxidizing solution to wells. The oxidizing solution was prepared by adding 6 mg of chloramine T/ml of oxidation buffer (3 ml of isopropyl alcohol, 1.65 ml of H2O, 1.95 ml of citrate-acetate buffer, pH 6). Next, 50 μl of standard or sample was added to each well. This was followed by addition of 100 μl of Ehrlich’s reagent (6 g ofp-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde dissolved in 52 ml of isopropyl alcohol and 16 ml of 50% perchloric acid) to each well. After incubating the samples at 60 °C for 45 min, the samples were cooled to room temperature. Absorbance was measured at 562 nm, and the amount of hydroxyproline present in samples was determined by comparison to a standard curve. Formalin-fixed wound edges were embedded in paraffin and sectioned. The sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized and stained with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Rac1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-VEGF (R&D Systems), or anti-tenascin (Chemi-Con International). Freshly dissected, unfixed wound edge was snap-frozen and immediately cut into 10 μm frozen sections. GFP expression was visualized and imaged using a fluorescent microscope (Nikon E800 with MetaMorph version 4.5 software, Universal Imaging Corp.). Image of the same frame shown in Fig. 6C was also captured using Differential Interference Contrast (DIC, Nomarski) optics. Wound edge sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized and stained using Masson Trichrome procedure (24Bancroft, J. D., and Stevens, A. (eds) (1996) Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques, Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh, ScotlandGoogle Scholar). This procedure result in blue-black nuclei, blue collagen and cytoplasm, and keratin, muscle fibers, and intracellular fibers all stained red. In vitro data are reported as mean ± S.D. of at least three experiments. Comparisons among multiple groups were made by analysis of variance. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In vivo: data from one wound of a mouse was compared with the other wound on the same mice using pairedt test. Micromolar concentrations of H2O2 induced VEGF protein expression in human HaCaT as well as primary keratinocytes (Fig. 1, A–C). Under conditions of co-existence, the effects of TNFα and H2O2 on VEGF induction were additive (Fig.1C). Simultaneous study of multiple angiogenesis-related genes using RNase protection assay indicated that VEGF mRNA is specifically sensitive to H2O2 exposure and that the control is at the transcriptional level (Fig.2A). Keratinocytes are not known to have functional VEGF receptors. Our results indicate the absence of Flt receptors in HaCaT (Fig. 2A). Several homologues of VEGF, VEGF-A, -B, -C, and -D, have been cloned. Most of the biologically important known functions of VEGF are ascribed to VEGF-A. Less is known about the function and regulation of VEGF-B, -C, and -D, but they do not seem to be regulated by the major pathways that regulate VEGF-A (25Carmeliet P. Collen D. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 133-158PubMed Google Scholar, 26Eriksson U. Alitalo K. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 41-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Specific study of the various forms of VEGF showed that all four varieties of VEGF are expressed in HaCaT. VEGF-A is selectively induced by H2O2. Among the three splice variants of VEGF-A studied, the 206 form was absent in HaCaT (not shown). Both splice variants of VEGF-A detected in HaCat were induced in response to H2O2 treatment (Fig.2B). To characterize the transcriptional control of the VEGF gene by H2O2, HaCaT cells were transiently transfected with VEGF promoter-luciferase constructs. This line of investigation was started using a 2.6-kb VEGF promoter fragment (bp −2361 to +298, relative to transcription start site) ligated to a luciferase reporter gene (Fig.3A). Fig. 3B shows that H2O2 clearly induced luciferase expression driven by the 2.6-kb promoter construct. To define the region of the VEGF promoter responsive to H2O2, we utilized a series of 5′ deletions of 2.6-kb promoter vector as demonstrated schematically in Fig. 3A. These deletion mutants were then transiently transfected to HaCaT keratinocytes to test the effect of H2O2 treatment. H2O2induced reporter activity in the 2.6-, 1.5- as well as 0.35-kb (bp −194 to +157) VEGF promoter constructs. Under these conditions, baseline reporter activity was comparably detected when the above-mentioned three constructs were used (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, when the 0.2-kb (bp −50 to +157) construct was used, both baseline as well as H2O2-induced reporter activity was completely lost. Similar results were obtained when the 0.07-kb (−50 to +18) construct was used. These results suggest that the sequence from bp −194 to −50 of the VEGF promoter is responsible for the H2O2 response. The 144-bp VEGF element (bp −194 to −51) that conferred H2O2-mediated transcriptional induction is GC-rich and contains four closely spaced GC boxes (bp −94 to −51) that have been identified to have Sp1 binding function in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (27Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to test whether these Sp1 binding sites were responsible to confer oxidant sensitivity to the VEGF promoter constructs. To accomplish this goal, a Sp-1 luc reporter construct containing three consensus Sp1 binding sites upstream of the luciferase gene was used. In experiments where HaCaT cells were transiently transfected with the Sp1-luc promoter construct, H2O2 indeed induced luciferase expression as shown in Fig. 3C. Further evidence to support that Sp1 plays a key role in oxidant-induced VEGF expression was obtained from experiments showing that H2O2-induced VEGF expression is inhibited by the Sp1 transcription inhibitor mithramycin A (Fig. 3D).Figure 2H2O2-sensitive gene expression related to angiogenesis.A, HaCaT cells were activated with H2O2 for 6–12 h.

VEGF isoforms and its homologues (VEGF-B, -C, and -D) were detected using reverse transcription-PCR.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hypoxia, a major regulator of inducible VEGF expression, is known to regulate VEGF by a pathway that is characterized by the presence of c-Src kinase upstream and by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 downstream (28Mukhopadhyay D. Tsiokas L. Zhou X.M. Foster D. Brugge J.S. Sukhatme V.P. Nature. 1995; 375: 577-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). As reported above, deletion analysis of VEGF reporter construct revealed that the HIF-1 sites in the VEGF-promoter were not involved in H2O2-induced VEGF transactivation. 2-Aminopurine is a serine-threonine kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks certain cellular events including inducibility (29Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA binding of HIF-1. Because activation of HIF-1 has been shown to be redox-sensitive we examined the effect of 2-aminopurine on H2O2-induced VEGF release (Fig. 3E). The observation that 2-aminopurine does not influence H2O2-induced VEGF expression is consistent with results reported in Fig. 3B indicating that H2O2-induced VEGF expression is not mediated by HIF-1 signaling. This observation supports the hypothesis that the downstream regulators of hypoxia and oxidant-induced VEGF expression are different. Exposure of cells to oxidants such as H2O2 is known to induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation primarily by inhibiting SH-rich protein tyrosine phosphatases (3Sen C.K. Packer L. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar, 18Sen C.K. Khanna S. Roy S. Packer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13049-13055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). The concentration of H2O2 that induced VEGF expression also induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Studies using protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors showed that c-Src kinase inhibitors such as herbimycin and geldanamycin inhibited H2O2-induced VEGF expression in HaCaT cells. Receptor protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor lavendustin A did not influence H2O2-induced VEGF expression (Fig.4). To test the effect of Rac1 overexpression on basal and H2O2-inducible VEGF expression, HaCaT cells were transiently transfected with an empty expression vector pEXV or an active expression vector encoding the constitutively active (rac1V12) Myc epitope-tagged cDNAs of Rac1. Transient transfection of cells with rac1V12 increased Rac1 protein expression as detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). Rac1 overexpression clearly increased VEGF expression under resting conditions as well as that induced by H2O2(Fig. 5B). The synergistic effect of Rac1 overexpression and H2O2 was best observed when a lower concentration of H2O2 was used to trigger submaximal VEGF expression. The potentiating effect of Rac1 on inducible VEGF expression was sensitive to DPI as well as apocynin (1–2.5 mm; not shown) suggesting that the observed effect of Rac1 was mediated by NADPH oxidase activity. These results suggest that under resting conditions HaCaT cells abundantly express Rac1. Transfection with rac1V12 further elevated Rac1 protein levels in the cell. Overexpression of Rac1 induced VEGF expression by a NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanism. To test the effect of Rac1 on wound contraction and closure, each of the two cutaneous wounds was topically treated either with the empty plasmid (pEXV) or with the expression plasmid encoding constitutively active Rac1 (rac1V12) for 4 days post-wounding. Rac1 overexpression in response to rac1V12 treatment is shown in Fig.6A. The rac1V12-treated side also showed more prominent VEGF staining as shown in Fig.6B. With the objective to detect endothelial cells we attempted to stain these same histological sections for the detection of CD31. Because of poor quality commercial antibody we were not able to obtain satisfactory staining specific for endothelial cells. To study effect of Rac1 gene therapy on endothelial cell proliferation, similar wounds were placed on the dorsal skin of FVB/ N-TgN-TIE2GFP mice. We observed that Rac1 overexpression was associated with a larger number of GFP-tagged endothelial cells in the healing wound (Fig. 6,C and D). For a more detailed visualization of the histological architecture of the wound edge tissue, sections were subjected to trichrome staining (Fig. 7). Rac1 gene therapy was associated with a more well defined hyperproliferative epithelial region, higher cell density, enhanced deposition of connective tissue, and improved overall histological organization. Fig. 9Cprovides direct biochemical evidence confirming that Rac1 gene therapy was indeed associated with higher wound edge collagen content as determined by hydroxyproline measurement. Wound healing is associated with a marked increase in the expression of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin (30Latijnhouwers M.A. Bergers M. Van Bergen B.H. Spruijt K.I. Andriessen M.P. Schalkwijk J. J. Path. 1996; 178: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Tenascin expression, a marker of wound repair, was clearly more prominent in wounds subjected to Rac1 gene therapy (Fig. 8). In summary, the histological data indicated that Rac1 might be an important stimulator of various aspects of the repair process, eventually enhancing the wound healing process as a whole (Figs.Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9).Figure 8Tenascin expression in wound edge in response to Rac1 gene transfer.

Rac1 gene transfer clearly accelerated wound closure, and the effect was clearly seen from day 1 after wounding (Fig.9B). One of the most rapid responses to increased accumulation of oxidants is the prompt oxidation of GSH to GSSG. Rac1-dependent cellular oxidant generation has been demonstrated in several previous studies (10Irani K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Sollott S.J. Der C.J. Fearon E.R. Sundaresan M. Finkel T.

Fig.9D provides direct evidence attesting that Rac1 gene transfer promoted oxidant generation in the wound edges. Activated phagocytic cells generate ROS as bactericidal agents by a NADPH oxidase-dependent respiratory burst mechanism (1Babior B.M. Kipnes R.S. Curnutte J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). More recently, non-phagocytic cells have been identified to generate ROS by a NADPH oxidase-dependent system (31Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J., Xu, X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Deficiencies in NADPH oxidase function causes chronic granulomatous disease, a disorder that is associated with wound infection and impaired wound healing (32Eckert J.W. Abramson S.L. Starke J. Brandt M.L. Am. J. Surg. 1995; 169: 320-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent studies indicate that ROS may serve as signaling mediators (4Sen C.K. Curr. Top. Cell. Reg. 2000; 36: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Among the various forms of ROS, H2O2 is relatively stable, membrane-permeable, and therefore a good candidate to serve as a cellular messenger (33Baeuerle P.A. Rupec R.A. Pahl H.L. Path. Biol. (Paris). 1996; 44: 29-35PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that by virtue of its signal transduction regulatory properties, ROS mediate some of the beneficial effects of oxygen on wound healing. Specifically, we observed that H2O2 induces VEGF expression (6Sen C.K. Khanna S. Venojarvi M. Trikha P. Ellison E.C. Hunt T.K. Roy S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H1821-H1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 7Khanna S. Roy S. Bagchi D. Bagchi M. Sen C.K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 38-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). ROS not only support angiogenesis but also stimulate collagen production (34Chandrakasan G. Bhatnagar R.S. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1991; 37: 751-755PubMed Google Scholar), a key event in wound healing. The wound microenvironment is dynamic involving activity of a number of chemical mediators. Under conditions of co-existence, H2O2 and TNFα co-operated to enhance inducible VEGF expression (Fig. 1). Deletion analysis using a series of mutant VEGF promoter constructs revealed that H2O2 induced VEGF expression is not mediated by HIF-1. HIF-1 is a major regulator of inducible VEGF expression. Although HIF-1β confers sensitivity to oxygen (35Semenza G.L. Cancer Met. Rev. 2000; 19: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), our results show that oxidants do not require HIF-1 to induce VEGF expression (Fig. 3). The sequence from bp −194 to −50 of the VEGF promoter was responsible for the H2O2 response. The 144-bp VEGF element (bp −194 to −51) that conferred H2O2-mediated transcriptional induction is GC-rich and contains four closely spaced GC boxes (bp −94 to −51) that have been identified to have Sp1 binding function in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (27Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Direct studies using Sp1 promoter constructs as well as the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin identified that Sp1 sites in the sequence from bp −194 to −50 of the VEGF promoter are responsible for the H2O2 response (Fig. 3). A single major transcription start is known to be located near these Sp1 binding sites in the VEGF gene promoter. Similar to H2O2, cytokines such as bFGF, platelet-derived growth factor, and TNFα are known to induce VEGF expression by a mechanism that requires Sp1 but not HIF (36Ryuto M. Ono M. Izumi H. Yoshida S. Weich H.A. Kohno K. Kuwano M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28220-28228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 37Finkenzeller G. Sparacio A. Technau A. Marme D. Siemeister G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Transcription control of the inducible VEGF gene by Sp1 is bidirectional. While our results show that Sp1 mediates induction of VEGF expression by oxidant, von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene-mediated transcriptional repression of VEGF expression is caused by a direct inhibitory action on Sp1 (27Mukhopadhyay D. Knebelmann B. Cohen H.T. Ananth S. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5629-5639Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Catalytically active NADPH oxidase univalently reduces molecular oxygen to generate O 2O, which in turn rapidly dismutates to form H2O2. Upon appropriate stimulation, a functional NADPH oxidase is assembled when the cytosolic proteins p47phox, p67phox, p40phox, and the small GTPase Rac (Rac1 or -2) associate with a membrane-localized flavocytochrome (cytochrome b559). The closely related small GTP-binding proteins Rac1, Rac2, and Rac3 are part of a larger Rho subfamily of Ras proteins. Rac1 controls actin redistribution to membrane ruffles in fibroblasts and other cell types, as well as the activation of the NADPH oxidase in both phagocytes as well as non-phagocytic cells (11Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X.

Although under conditions such as reoxygenation injury, Rac1-dependent oxidant production may prove to be deleterious (12Kim K.S. Takeda K. Sethi R. Pracyk J.B. Tanaka K. Zhou Y.F., Yu, Z.X.

Invest. 1998; 101: 1821-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we sought to utilize the oxidant-generating ability of Rac1 to accelerate wound healing. In vitro, Rac1 overexpression increased VEGF expression and worked synergistically with H2O2to enhance VEGF expression in a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. In vivo, Rac1 overexpression was associated with more prominent expression of VEGF and proliferation of endothelial cells. Study of the spatial control of growth factor-induced Rac activation revealed that Rac1 activation is associated with activation at the leading edge of motile cells (39Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Remodeling of the extracellular matrix and consequent alterations of integrin-mediated adhesion and cytoarchitecture are central to wound healing. It has been observed that activation of Rac1 may lead to altered gene regulation and alterations in cellular morphogenesis, migration, and invasion (40Kheradmand F. Werner E. Tremble P. Symons M. Werb Z. Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, we observed that Rac1 gene transfer clearly facilitated murine excisional dermal wound closure and tissue remodeling. These findings are in line with the proposed central role of Rac1 in regulating cellular morphogenesis and migration (40Kheradmand F. Werner E. Tremble P. Symons M. Werb Z. Science. 1998; 280: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results of this study provide firm support to the claim that wound healing is subject to redox control. It is established that μm oxidant induces VEGF expression and that oxidant-induced VEGF expression is independent of HIF-1 and dependent on Sp1. Using the Rac1 gene transfer approach it is documented that strategies to promote oxidant production in the wound microenvironment may promote wound healing. Technical assistance of J. Vider and M.

The additional contribution of intestinal lipoprotein overproduction to the dyslipidemia of insulin-resistant states has not been previously appreciated. Here, we have investigated intestinal lipoprotein production in a fructose-fed hamster model of insulin resistance previously documented to have whole body and hepatic insulin resistance, and hepatic very low density lipoprotein overproduction. Chronic fructose feeding for 3 weeks induced significant oversecretion of apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48)-containing lipoproteins in the fasting state and during steady state fat feeding, based on (<i>a</i>)<i>in vivo</i> Triton WR1339 studies of apoB48 production as well as (<i>b</i>) <i>ex vivo</i> pulse-chase labeling of intestinal enterocytes from fasted and fed hamsters. ApoB48 particle overproduction was accompanied by increased intracellular apoB48 stability, enhanced lipid synthesis, higher abundance of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein mass, and a significant shift toward the secretion of larger chylomicron-like particles. ApoB48 particle overproduction was not observed with short-term fructose feeding or<i>in vitro</i> incubation of enterocytes with fructose. Secretion of intestinal apoB48 and triglyceride was closely linked to intestinal enterocyte <i>de novo</i> lipogenesis, which was up-regulated in fructose-fed hamsters. Inhibition of fatty acid synthesis by cerulenin, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in intestinal apoB48 secretion. Overall, these findings further suggest that intestinal overproduction of apoB48 lipoproteins should also be considered as a major contributor to the fasting and postprandial dyslipidemia observed in response to chronic fructose feeding and development of an insulin-resistant state."

HIF-1 expression is induced by hypoxia, growth factors, and activation of oncogenes. In response to hypoxia, HIF-1 activates the expression of many genes including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin. HIF-1 and VEGF play an important role in angiogenesis and tumor progression. Vanadate is widely used in industry, and is a potent inducer of tumors in humans and animals. In this study, we demonstrate that vanadate induces HIF-1 activity through the expression of HIF-1α but not HIF-1β subunit, and increases VEGF expression in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells. We also studied the signaling pathway involved in vanadate-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression and found that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling was required for HIF-1 and VEGF expression induced by vanadate, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway was not required. We also found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were involved in vanadate-induced expression of HIF-1 and VEGF in DU145 cells. The major species of ROS responsible for the induction of HIF-1 and VEGF expression was H2O2.

There is a strong correlation between VEGF expression and blood vessel density in many tumor types (26Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr.

Inhibition of VEGF expression and of its receptor function dramatically decreases the tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis in animal models (27Millauer B. Longhi M.P. Plate K.H. Shawver L.K.

Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar). Vanadium is a widely distributed trace metal. The burning of fossil fuels (petroleum, coal, and oil) in power and heat producing plants causes widespread discharge of vanadium into the environment (31Crans D.C. Simone C.M. Saha A.K. Glew R.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 246-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Nriagu J.O. Pacyna J.M. Nature. 1988; 333: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). Vanadium exists in oxidation states ranging from −1 to +5. Among these oxidation states, the pentavalent state is the most stable form. Previous studies provide evidence that in mammalian systems vanadium(V) is more toxic than vanadium(IV). The data on the carcinogenic activity of vanadium is limited. Epidemiological studies have shown a correlation between vanadium exposure and the incidence of cancer in humans (33Rojas E. Herrera L.A. Porier L.A. Ostrosky-Wegman P. Mutat.

Some reports indicate that vanadium increases the frequency of micronuclei and polyploid cells, decreases mitotic index, and induces DNA single strand breaks and DNA-protein cross-links (37Altamirano-Lozano M.

Previous in vitro studies using cultured mouse embryo fibroblast BALB/3T3 cells and the Syrian hamster embryo cells demonstrated that this metal is a carcinogen (40Sabbioni E. Pozzi G. Pintar A.

Although the mechanisms of vanadate-induced carcinogenesis are not fully understood, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered to play an important role (44Ding M., Li, J.J. Leonard S.S., Ye, J. Shi X. Colburn N.H. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 45Ye J. Ding M. Leonard S.S. Robinson V.A. Michecchia L. Zhang X. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Shi X. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 202: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been reported that upon reduction by cellular reactants, vanadate is able to generate a whole spectrum of ROS, i.e. O2⨪, H2O2, and ·OH. It is well known that ROS play an important role in carcinogenesis induced by a variety of carcinogens. Through ROS-mediated reaction, vanadate is able to induce activation of activator protein-1 expression (44Ding M., Li, J.J. Leonard S.S., Ye, J. Shi X. Colburn N.H. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 663-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 45Ye J. Ding M. Leonard S.S. Robinson V.A. Michecchia L. Zhang X. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Shi X. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, we tested whether vanadate is able to induce the expression of HIF-1α and VEGF in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells and evaluated the role of individual ROS. The following specific questions were addressed: (a) whether vanadate is able to induce HIF-1 and VEGF expression; (b) which signaling pathway(s) is/are involved in vanadate-induced expression of HIF-1α protein; (c) whether ROS species are involved in vanadate-induced HIF-1α and VEGF expression; and (d) which species of ROS play a critical role. Sodium orthovanadate, NADPH, superoxide dismutase, sodium formate, deferoxamine, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), and rotenone were purchased from Sigma. Catalase was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Antibodies against HIF-1α and HIF-1β were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), phospho-Akt (Ser473) and Akt antibodies were from Cellular Signaling (Beverly, MA). The human VEGF immunoassay kit was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The human prostate cancer cell line DU145 was maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 3% chicken serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2incubator. The cells form a monolayer at confluence. Trypsin (0.25%)/EDTA solution was used to detach the cells from the culture flask for passing the cells. The cells were plated in a 60-mm culture dish and treated with vanadate. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaF) supplemented with 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm leupeptin, 2 mm aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 2 mm pepstatin A on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant was harvested as the total cellular protein extracts and stored at −70 °C. The protein concentration was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagents. The total cellular protein extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm glycine and 20% (v/v) methanol. Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated with antibodies against HIF-1α, HIF-1β, phospho-Akt (Ser473), and Akt. Protein bands were detected by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped from the plates, and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 5 min. The cell pellet was incubated for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF) supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm leupeptin, and 2 mm aprotinin, and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min to clarify the supernatants. PI3K activity was analyzed using 400 μg of protein extracts and anti-p110 antibodies as described (28Plate K.H. Breier G. Weich H.A. Risau W. Nature. 1992; 359: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar, 29Plate K.H. Breier G. Millauer B. Ullrich A. Risau W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5822-5827PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 400 μg of total protein was incubated with 20 μl of protein A/G plus agarose for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator, followed by spinning at 3,000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant was then incubated with 10 μl of antibodies against p110 subunit of PI3K for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose beads (30 μl) were added for an additional 1 h. The beads were then pelleted and washed sequentially with TNE buffer (containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), five times; and once with 20 mm HEPES. PI3K assays were performed using phosphatidylinositol as substrate in a final volume of 50 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 60 μm ATP, and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated phosphatidylinositol. Reactions were carried out for 15 min at room temperature and extracted by the addition of 80 μl of 1 m HCl and 160 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:1). After centrifugation, the organic phase was evaporated to dryness and separated on a TLC plate. PI3K activity was analyzed by the incorporation of 32P into phosphorylated lipids, and detected by autoradiography. Autoradiographic signals of immunoblot and PI3K activity assays were quantified using molecular analyst/PC densitometry software (Bio-Rad). Mean densitometry data from independent experiments were normalized to result in cells in the control. The data were presented as the mean ± S.E., and analyzed by the Student's t test. DU145 cells were plated in a 6-well plate at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in MEM and incubated overnight before the cells were subjected to treatment. After treatment, the cell culture media were removed for storage at −80 °C. Levels of VEGF protein in the medium were determined by ELISA using a commercial kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, 200 μl of standards or cell culture supernatant were added to the wells of a microplate that was pre-coated with a monoclonal antibody specific for VEGF and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing away any unbounded substances, an enzyme-linked polyclonal antibody against VEGF conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Following a wash, 200 μl of substrate solution was added to the wells and incubated for 30 min, and then 50 μl of stop solution was added to stop color development. The optical density of each well was determined using a microplate reader at 450 nm. The experiments were repeated twice with two replications per experiment. Mean values from these samples were analyzed. The ESR spin trapping technique with DMPO as the spin trap was used to detect free radical generation. This technique involves the addition-type reaction of a short-lived radical with a diamagnetic compound (spin trap) to form a relative long-lived free radical product (spin adduct), which can be studied by conventional ESR (50Rosen G.M. Finkelstein E. Adv. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1985; 1: 345-375Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The intensity of the spin adduct signal corresponds to the amount of short-lived radicals trapped, and the hyperfine couplings of the spin adduct were generally characteristic of the original trapped radicals. All ESR measurements were conducted using a Varian E9 ESR spectrometer and a flat cell assembly as described (51Shi X. Dalal N.S. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 52Shi X. Dalal N.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 289: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hyperfine couplings were measured (to 0.1 G) directly from magnetic field separation using potassium tetraperoxochromate (K3CrO8) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl as reference standards. Reactants were mixed in test tubes in a total final volume of 500 μl and transferred to a flat cell for ESR measurement. Cellular H2O2 was determined using a quantitative H2O2 assay kit (BIOXYTECH, Portland, OR). The assay was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. This assay is based on the oxidation of ferrous ions (Fe2+) to ferric ions (Fe3+) by H2O2 under acidic conditions. The ferric ion binds with the indicator dye xylenol orange to form a stable colored complex that can be measured at 560 nm. Briefly, cells were pretreated with vanadate and with or without antioxidants. The aliquots of media were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min with 100 μl of a 10× xylenol orange stock solution (xylenol orange (10 μm), Fe(NH4)2(SO4)·6H2O (2.5 μm), H2SO4 (25 mm)) after which the absorbance was read at 560 nm. The concentration of H2O2 was determined from a standard curve. Dihydroethidium (HE) is a specific dye for O2⨪. HE was oxidized by O2⨪ to ethidium that stains nucleus to form a bright fluorescent red (53Marchetti P. Castedo M. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Hirsch T. Macho A. Haeffiner A. Hirsch F. Geuskens M. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1155-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). The cells were plated onto a glass coverslip in the 12-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/well 24 h before treatment. HE was added into the cell culture 30 min before vanadate treatment was completed. After being stained, the cells were washed in PBS and fixed with 10% buffered formalin. The coverslip was mounted on a glass slide and observed using a Saratro 2000 (Amersham Biosciences) laser scanning confocal microscope (Optiphot-2, Nikon, Inc., Melville, PA) fitted with an argon-ion laser. Oxygen consumption measurements were carried out with a Gilson oxygraph equipped with a Clark electrode (Gilson Medical Electronic, Middleton, WI). These measurements were made from a mixture containing 1 × 106 cells/ml and various treatments in a total volume of 1.5 ml. The oxygraph was calibrated with media equilibrated with oxygen of known concentrations. To determine whether vanadate could induce HIF-1 expression, DU145 cells were treated with various concentrations of vanadate for 6 h, and the total cellular protein extracts were prepared for immunoblot assays of HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein levels. As shown in Fig.1A, levels of HIF-1α protein were induced by vanadate in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the levels of HIF-1β protein were not altered. The maximum expression of HIF-1α was induced by 100 μm vanadate (Fig. 1A). To determine the kinetics of HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate, cells were treated with 100 μmvanadate for various times as indicated, and cellular protein extracts were prepared for analysis of HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein levels. As shown in Fig. 1B, vanadate-induced HIF-1α expression in a time-dependent manner, whereas it did not alter HIF-1β expression. The maximum induction of HIF-1α expression was at 6 h after the treatment. The prolonged exposure of cells to vanadate resulted in the decrease of HIF-1α protein levels, possibly because of the apoptosis of the cells induced by this metal (data not shown). To determine whether the PI3K signaling pathway was required for HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate, DU145 cells were pretreated with PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin. The cells were then exposed to vanadate for 6 h, and total cellular protein extracts were prepared for immunoblot assays of HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein levels. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, were able to inhibit vanadate-induced HIF-1α expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas these inhibitors did not change HIF-1β protein levels. These results suggest that PI3K activity was required for the HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate. We also investigated whether mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was required for HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate. Cells were pretreated with various concentrations of PD98059, an inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase (MEK). Cells were then treated with 100 μm vanadate for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 2C, addition of PD98059 did not inhibit HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate. These results suggest that MEK activity was not required for HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate. To further confirm that the PI3K activity was involved in HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate, DU145 cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, followed by treatment with various concentrations of vanadate for 2 h or 100 μmvanadate for various periods as indicated (Fig.3). The cells were then washed with cold 1× PBS and the total cellular protein extracts (400 μg) were used for determining PI3K activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, PI3K activity was induced by vanadate in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum induction of PI3K activity appeared at 100 μm vanadate. To determine the kinetics of PI3K activity induced by vanadate, the cells were treated with 100 μmvanadate for various times. PI3K activity was induced 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h after the addition of vanadate (Fig.3B). We also investigated endogenous Akt phosphorylation in response to vanadate treatment. Cells were incubated with certain concentrations of vanadate for 2 h, and the total cellular protein extracts were used to determine levels of phospho-Akt for Ser473 and Akt proteins using immunoblot assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, vanadate induced Akt phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it did not alter the Akt protein level. The induction of Akt phosphorylation was maximum by the treatment of vanadate at 100 μm. To study the kinetics on Akt phosphorylation induced by vanadate, cells were treated with 100 μm vanadate for 0–4 h, and total cellular protein extracts were used for the assay of phospho-Akt (Ser473) and Akt protein levels. As shown in Fig.3D, vanadate induced Akt phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, whereas it did not affect Akt protein level. The maximum induction of Akt phosphorylation occurred 2 h after the addition of vanadate. These results suggest that vanadate-induced PI3K activity and Akt phosphorylation, and further confirmed that PI3K/Akt pathway was required for vanadate-induced HIF-1α expression. To further investigate whether vanadate-induced HIF-1α expression through the PI3K/Akt pathway, DU145 cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h, followed by the addition of LY294002 and wortmannin, respectively, 30 min prior to treatment with 100 μm vanadate for 2 h. Cellular protein extracts were used for analysis of PI3K activity and Akt phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.4A, both LY294002 and wortmannin inhibited PI3K activity induced by vanadate. Similarly, these PI3K inhibitors also inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 induced by vanadate (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that vanadate-induced Akt phosphorylation was through PI3K activation, and further confirming that the PI3K/Akt pathway was required for induction of HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate. To investigate whether rapamycin, a mTOR/FRAP inhibitor, could inhibit HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate, DU145 cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h, followed by the addition of rapamycin 30 min prior to the treatment of 100 μmvanadate for 6 h. Cellular lysates were prepared and used to determine HIF-1α and HIF-1β protein levels. As shown in Fig.5, rapamycin inhibited vanadate-induced HIF-1α expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas rapamycin did not cause any decrease in HIF-1β protein level. The results suggest that mTOR/FRAP, a downstream target of PI3K/Akt, was required for HIF-1α expression induced by vanadate. HIF-1 is known to activate VEGF expression in response to low oxygen. To investigate whether induction of HIF-1α expression by vanadate results in an increase in HIF-1-regulated gene expression, the level of VEGF protein in DU145 cells after exposure of vanadate was analyzed using ELISA. Treatment of cells with 50 μm vanadate significantly increased VEGF levels in a time-dep"
https://openalex.org/W1606958078,"We have previously reported that junctional adhesion molecule 2 (JAM2) adheres to T cells through heterotypic interactions with JAM3. An examination of the cation dependence of JAM2 adhesion to HSB cells revealed a Mn2+-enhanced binding component indicative of integrin involvement. Using neutralizing integrin antibodies, we have defined an interaction between JAM2 and α4β1 in T cells. The interaction is readily amenable to drug intervention as demonstrated by the ability of TBC 772, an α4-specific inhibitor, to attenuate the Mn2+-enhanced component. Intriguingly, the engagement of α4β1 by JAM2 is only enabled following prior adhesion of JAM2 with JAM3 and is not detectable in cells where JAM3 expression is absent. Supporting this observation, we show that neutralizing JAM3 serum and soluble JAM3 ectodomain inhibit not only JAM2 binding to JAM3 but also prevent JAM2/α4β1 interactions in T cells. We further define the first Ig-like fold of JAM2 as being competent in binding both JAM3 and α4β1counter-receptors. Mutagenesis of the only acidic residue in the C-D loop of this Ig fold, namely Asp-82, has no bearing on α4β1 interactions, and thus JAM2 deviates somewhat from the mechanism used by other immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules to engage integrin.

Most recently we demonstrated that JAM3 2Official nomenclature for junctional adhesion molecules can be viewed at LocusLink (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink). Other synonyms: human JAM1 protein is equivalent to human JAM, mouse JAM, and mouse JAM-1; human JAM2 protein is equivalent to VE-JAM and mouse JAM-3; human JAM3 protein is equivalent to mouse JAM-2. was the 43-kDa T cell-expressed JAM2 (VE-JAM) counter-receptor. Up-regulation of JAM3 following T cell activation revealed a mechanism by which selective adhesion and/or emigration of lymphocytes may occur (7Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The observation that JAM3 is also expressed on natural killer and dendritic cells and is capable of adhering to JAM2 (VE-JAM) extends the role of the JAM2 (VE-JAM)/JAM3 heterotypic interaction in inflammation (8Liang T.W. Chiu H.H. Gurney A. Sidle A. Tumas D.B. Schow P. Foster J. Klassen T. Dennis K. DeMarco R.A. Pham T. Frantz G. Fong S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1618-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The importance of integrins in adhesion and transmigration is paramount and well established (9Worthylake R.A. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Several key IgSF cell adhesion molecules engage integrin and in so doing impact on the multistep paradigm of leukocyte emigration (10Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6414) Google Scholar, 11Holness C.L. Simmons D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2065-2070PubMed Google Scholar). To help define how JAM fits into this sequential cascade, we sought a relationship between the JAM and integrin families. In this study we report an interaction between JAM2 and α4β1 that is facilitated by prior engagement of JAM2 with T cell-expressed JAM3. The JAM nomenclature used throughout this report, and prior publications from this group, complies with the official names designated by the Human Genome Nomenclature Committee. JAM2-Fc adhesion to various calcein-acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes Inc.)-loaded leukocyte cell lines was performed by capture of fusion protein onto 96-well plates by either goat anti-mouse IgG or chicken anti-Myc antibodies as described previously (3Cunningham S.A.

Adhesion was performed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with various combinations of 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmMnCl2 for 90 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Adhered cells were lysed, and fluorescence was quantified in a CytoFluor plate reader with excitation at 485 ± 20 nm and emission at 530 ± 25 nm. For inhibitor studies, the JAM3 ectodomain was cleaved from the JAM3-Fc by thrombin and purified as described previously (7Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The JAM3 ectodomain, neutralizing JAM3 serum, integrin antibodies, or the compounds TBC 772 (C*WLDVC*) and TBC 1194 (C*DLVWC*) were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with calcein-loaded cells prior to their incorporation into the adhesion assay. For generation of the secreted JAM2-Fc-Myc fusion, sense 5′-GGGAAGCTTACTATCATAAGGCCTATGGGTTTTC-3′ and antisense 5′-GGAAGATCT TTTACCCGGAGTCCGGGAGAAGCTC-3′ oligonucleotides incorporating HindIII and BglII sites, respectively, were used to amplify the JAM2-Fc, minus the signal peptide and stop codon, from a previously generated construct (3Cunningham S.A.

Cycling was achieved with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 45 s; 25 cycles at 95 °C for 45 s, 59 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 120 s; one cycle at 72 °C for 600 s. The product was inserted into the APtag-5 vector (GenHunter Corp.) usingHindIII and BglII to generate the JAM2-Fc with further C-terminal tags of AP, Myc, and His combined with the Ig κ-chain secretion signal peptide. For the JAM2 Ig fold domain 1 constructs, sense 5′-GCCGCGGATCCAAGATGGCGAGGAGG-3′ and antisense 5′-GGTACCTGCTGGAGCCACTAATAC-3′ primers that incorporatedBamHI and KpnI sites, respectively, were used. Cycling was with Takara Ex Taq DNA Polymerase (Panvera) as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 120 s; 20 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and one cycle at 72 °C for 300 s. For JAM2 Ig fold domain 2 constructs, sense 5′-GTTCCATCATGTGAAGTACC-3′ and antisense 5′-GGCCTATGGGTTTTCTGCC-3′ oligonucleotides were used to loop out the N-terminal Ig fold using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and cycling as follows: one cycle at 94 °C for 240 s, 50 °C for 120 s, 72 °C for 600 s; 12 cycles at 94 °C for 60 s, 55 °C for 120 s, and 68 °C for 600s. Individual domains were subcloned into pFastBac1 vector (Invitrogen) possessing the constant region of mouse IgG2a (3Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Bjercke R.J. Vanderslice P. Morris A.P.

The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used for mutagenesis. Primers for JAM2-D82A were: sense, 5′-CAGACTCTTCAAGGTGCTTTTAAAAATCGAGCTG-3′and antisense 5′-CAGCTCGATTTTTAAAAGCACCTTGAAGAGTCTG-3′. JAM-Fc fusion proteins were generated as secreted proteins in Sf21 cells as previously described or in COS cells (3Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Bjercke R.J. Vanderslice P. Morris A.P.

For the latter, cells were transfected with 6 μg of the various pcDNA6 JAM-Fc constructs and 18 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Serum-free media from either cell type was harvested on day 3 and purified over HiTrap Protein A HP columns (Amersham Biosciences). HSB cells (1 × 106) were labeled with primary monoclonal antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline for 45 min followed by subsequent incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were analyzed in a Beckman Coulter Epics XL. The neutralizing integrin antibodies against α4 (clone P4C2), β1 (clone P5D2), and β2 (clone YFC118.3) were from Chemicon, and anti-β7 (clone R35-95) was from BD PharMingen. Chicken anti-Myc was purchased from Aves Labs, Inc. TBC 772 and TBC 1194 are drugs generated by Texas Biotechnology Corp. Neutralizing anti-JAM3 polyclonal serum was generated in female BALB/c mice. The purified JAM3 ectodomain was used as immunogen using procedures described previously (3Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Bjercke R.J. Vanderslice P. Morris A.P. Brock T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34750-34756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In characterizing the JAM2 interaction with T cell-expressed JAM3, we routinely performed adhesion in TBS plus all three of the cations Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ (binding buffer). An examination of the divalent cation dependence of adhesion revealed that JAM2 binding to HSB cells occurred independently of cation additions (Fig. 1 a). Thus, binding in the presence of TBS plus 1 mm EDTA was comparable with that obtained in binding buffer. In contrast a marked enhancement of JAM2 adhesion, above and beyond that obtained in binding buffer, was observed in the presence of TBS plus Mn2+. Subsequent analysis using cation combinations revealed that calcium was responsible for masking the enhancement of Mn2+ (Fig.1 a). In HSB and other T cell lines, we routinely recorded up to a 10-fold enhancement of adhesion. The divalent cation dependence of integrin function is well established. Coordination of divalent cations by integrin, and in particular Mn2+, induces conformational changes within integrin extracellular domains resulting in exposure of epitopes required for ligand engagement (12Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 485-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Additionally, the ability of Ca2+ to counteract this effect is a general observation (11Holness C.L. Simmons D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2065-2070PubMed Google Scholar, 12Mould A.P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2613-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Shimaoka M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Thus, our data suggested that JAM2 was not only able to adhere with T cell-expressed JAM3 but also possibly engage with an integrin counter-receptor on the same cell. As the first candidates to investigate, we considered the α4 integrins since they play a proven role in lymphocyte motility and appear particularly specialized to promote leukocyte migration (15Kassner P.D. Alon R. Springer T.A. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 661-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 16Liu S. Rose D.M. Han J. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 17Chan P.Y. Aruffo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24655-24664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Wu C. Fields A.J.

The α4 subunit associates with β1 and β7 to form α4β1 and α4β7. Analysis of HSB cells by flow cytometry revealed expression of both α4 and β1, whereas the β7 subunit was not detectable (Fig. 1 b). To probe for an interaction between JAM2 and α4β1, we used neutralizing antibodies raised against the individual α4 and β1 subunits to inhibit the JAM2 adhesion to HSB cells. Fig. 1 c unequivocally demonstrates that JAM2 binds α4β1 in HSB cells. As expected, both neutralizing antibodies and isotype controls were without effect when adhesion was tested in TBS, the component assigned to the binding of JAM2 with JAM3 (7Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast both anti-α4 and anti-β1 greatly attenuated the Mn2+-enhanced component, reducing it to a level comparable to that obtained in TBS alone. Higher concentrations of antibody did not further attenuate adhesion (data not shown). The data thus demonstrate a mixed binding reaction in TBS + Mn2+ where molecules of JAM2 bind JAM3 and/or α4β1. VCAM-1, the classical IgSF binding partner for α4β1, also binds to α4β7 (20Ruegg C. Postigo A.A. Sikorski E.E. Butcher E.C. Pytela R. Erle D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Whether JAM2 can engage with α4β7 in other cell lines or under other conditions remains an open question. Just prior to completion of this study, Weber et al. (21Ostermann G. Weber K.S. Zernecke A. Schroder A. Weber C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar) demonstrated the interaction of JAM1 with LFA-1. A β2 integrin binding component is not apparent in our JAM2 adhesion assays; although the β2subunit is expressed on the HSB cell surface, the neutralizing antibody has no effect on JAM2 HSB cell adhesion (Fig. 1, b andc). To extend and further validate this interaction, we asked whether TBC 772, a cyclic hexapeptide and potent antagonist of α4integrins, could prevent the engagement of JAM2 with α4β1 (22Vanderslice P. Ren K. Revelle J.K. Kim D.C. Scott D. Bjercke R.J. Yeh E.T. Beck P.J. Kogan T.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 1710-1718PubMed Google Scholar). The dose-response curves show that although TBC 772 is ineffective when assessed in TBS, a clear attenuation is observed in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig.1 d). Following inhibition with compound, adhesion reached a level that approximated that obtained in TBS with an IC50averaging 60 nm over three independent experiments. The specificity of inhibition is further demonstrated by the inability of TBC 1194, a control scrambled peptide, to reduce the Mn2+-enhanced component (Fig. 1 d). These results convincingly demonstrate that the JAM2/α4β1interaction is readily amenable to inhibition by small molecules and thus provides clear possibilities for future drug development. The selective adhesion of JAM2 to T cells was previously discovered when performing binding assays in the presence of all three cations (3Cunningham S.A. Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Bjercke R.J.

Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). While these conditions are optimal for monitoring the JAM2/JAM3 adhesive event in this assay, the JAM2/α4β1engagement that occurs with the defined cation requirements reported in Fig. 1 a would have been overlooked. Thus, we reassessed JAM2 adhesion in the presence of Mn2+ to B cells (Ramos) and monocytic cells (HL60) that also express α4β1 but not JAM3 (7Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The erythroleukemic K562 cells that express neither JAM3 nor α4β1 were included as a negative control. Surprisingly, Fig. 2 ademonstrates that Mn2+-dependent JAM2 binding is restricted to JAM3-expressing T cells. Therefore, our assay conditions revealed a possible dependence for the JAM2/α4β1 interaction upon co-expression of JAM3 within the same cell. We next wished to determine what impact T cell-expressed JAM3 had on the JAM2/integrin interaction. It seemed likely that binding of JAM2 to JAM3 facilitated interactions of JAM2 with α4β1. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of soluble JAM3 ectodomain (cleaved by thrombin from JAM3-Fc and purified), which is an efficient blocker of JAM2 binding to cell surface-expressed JAM3 (7Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 b shows that excess soluble JAM3 can completely prevent HSB cell adhesion to JAM2 regardless of buffer composition. Although this result supported our hypothesis, it might be postulated that JAM3 and α4β1 share a common binding site on JAM2. Upon soluble JAM3 binding to captured JAM2-Fc, epitopes for engagement with α4β1 may be masked. Therefore we used neutralizing anti-JAM3 serum to prevent the JAM2/JAM3 interaction while leaving JAM2 free for adhesion (Fig. 2 c). The complete block of JAM2 binding under these conditions allows us to conclude that JAM2 must bind HSB cell-expressed JAM3 as a prerequisite to interactions with α4β1. To explore the mechanism in more detail, we set out to determine the domain dependence of the specific adhesions. The N-terminal and C-terminal Ig folds were generated as separate Fc fusion proteins and incorporated into the standard adhesion assay. Fig.3 a shows that the first Ig fold is capable of supporting both cation-independent and Mn2+-enhanced adhesion and therefore possesses the primary sites of contact for both JAM3 and integrin binding. The other well described IgSF molecules that engage α4 integrins, namely VCAM-1 and MAdCAM-1, also present dominant binding motifs in the most N-terminal Ig fold (23Osborn L. Vassallo C.

In contrast, the second Ig fold of JAM1, which is located adjacent to the transmembrane domain, mediates binding to LFA-1 (21Ostermann G. Weber K.S. Zernecke A. Schroder A. Weber C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Commonly, IgSF molecules bind integrin through key residues found within the loop(s) intervening the C and D β-strands of the interacting Ig fold (11Holness C.L. Simmons D.L. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2065-2070PubMed Google Scholar). Further, a consensus, (L/I)(D/E)(S/T/V)(P/S), has been identified from homologous sequences within VCAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecules, and MAdCAM-1. Examination of the JAM2 sequence reveals only two acidic amino acids, Glu-62 and Asp-82, that fall within the sequence intervening proposed β-strands C and D of the N-terminal Ig fold (27Kostrewa D. Brockhaus M. D'Arcy A. Dale G.E. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Mueller F. Bazzoni G. Dejana E. Bartfai T. Winkler F.K. Hennig M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). By analogy with JAM1, Glu-62 is predicted to be an integral part of the conserved dimerization motif R(V/I/L)E, namely mediating salt bridge formation between JAM2 monomers (27Kostrewa D. Brockhaus M. D'Arcy A. Dale G.E. Nelboeck P. Schmid G. Mueller F. Bazzoni G. Dejana E. Bartfai T. Winkler F.K. Hennig M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Further, Glu-62 aligns well within the C′ β-strand. In contrast, Asp-82 is predicted to reside within the C“-D loop. While it does not fall within the context specified by other cell adhesion molecules, the QDG motif is reminiscent of the invariant RGD sequence common to many adhesive extracellular macromolecules. To explore its contributions to JAM2 adhesion, we mutated Asp-82 to alanine and studied its consequences. Surprisingly, Fig. 3 b shows that JAM2 Asp-82 does not play a significant role, if any, in establishment of the JAM2-integrin complex. Less remarkable was the observation that loss of this charge does not attenuate JAM3 binding. JAM2 may utilize an acidic residue in a different loop or even possibly a β-strand to bind α4β1. As such, it deviates somewhat from the classical IgSF/integrin interaction. The alternative binding sites employed by JAM2 to achieve α4β1 engagement may underlie the apparent low affinity of this adhesive event. The requirements for efficient adhesion of JAM2 and VCAM-1 with α4β1 differ under the same experimental conditions. VCAM-1 is fully capable of forming strong contacts in the presence of 1 mm Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, and clearly its interaction is independent of JAM3. On the other hand, under the conditions defined herein, the JAM2/α4β1 interaction does not appear sufficient to allow capture of HSB cells in itself but requires the participation of JAM3. Further, the inhibitory Ca2+ cation must be minimized in the assay. Since Mn2+ is by far the most potent stimulus for enabling the transition of the β1 subunit from the inactive to active conformation, our data would suggest that only the fully activated, Mn2+-bound α4β1 allows for JAM2 binding (28Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19800-19805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Further, this conformation in itself is not sufficient but requires an event contributed by the JAM2 interaction with JAM3. While this may simply be facilitation of a lower affinity interaction between JAM2 and α4β1 by enabling more frequent, closer contacts between the two molecules, other more complicated scenarios can be envisaged. For example, it was postulated most recently from yeast two-hybrid studies that JAM1 could bind LFA-1 in both cis and trans (21Ostermann G. Weber K.S. Zernecke A. Schroder A. Weber C. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Although JAM2 does not appear to be a T cell-expressed molecule, a similar lateral interaction could be envisaged between α4 and JAM3 (7Arrate M.P. Rodriguez J.M. Tran T.M. Brock T.A. Cunningham S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45826-45832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar,8Liang T.W. Chiu H.H. Gurney A. Sidle A. Tumas D.B. Schow P. Foster J. Klassen T. Dennis K. DeMarco R.A. Pham T. Frantz G. Fong S. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1618-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, using the same yeast two-hybrid system, we have been unable to detect such a relationship between the cytoplasmic tails of α4 and JAM3 (data not show). In the multistep paradigm of leukocyte emigration, provided that JAM2 remains primarily within the cell junctions, we would predict the JAM2/α4β1 event to occur more distal to that of the VCAM-1/α4β1 interaction as the leukocyte begins it emigration between endothelial cells. By definition, endothelial molecules that facilitate leukocyte extravasation are required to form only weak and/or transient interactions with the migrating cell. This first report, describing the characteristics of JAM2 adhesion to α4β1, presents a new interaction that may be particularly suited for this role and may provide a new target site for development of novel anti-inflammatory therapies. We are particularly grateful to Bob Bjerke for immunization of mice, to Dee Scott for maintaining all leukocyte cell lines, and to Kay Sughrue for culture of Sf21 and COS cells. We thank Drs. Richard Dixon, Darren Woodside, and Peter Vanderslice for critical reading of the manuscript and helpful comments."
https://openalex.org/W2012557606,"Speech segmentation, determining where one word ends and the next begins in continuous speech, is necessary for auditory language processing. However, because there are few direct indices of this fast, automatic process, it has been difficult to study. We recorded event-related brain potentials (ERPs) while adult humans listened to six pronounceable nonwords presented as continuous speech and compared the responses to nonword onsets before and after participants learned the nonsense words. In subjects showing the greatest behavioral evidence of word learning, word onsets elicited a larger N100 after than before training. Thus N100 amplitude indexes speech segmentation even for recently learned words without any acoustic segmentation cues. The timing and distribution of these results suggest specific processes that may be central to speech segmentation."

A cell-free assay was developed in which membranes from M. smegmatis overexpressing the pimA gene incorporate mannose from GDP-[14C]Man into di- and tri-acylated phosphatidylinositol mono-mannosides. Moreover, crude extracts from Escherichia coli producing a recombinant PimA protein synthesized diacylated phosphatidylinositol mono-mannoside from GDP-[14C]Man and bovine phosphatidylinositol. To determine whether PimA is an essential enzyme of mycobacteria, we constructed a pimA conditional mutant of M. smegmatis. The ability of this mutant to synthesize the PimA mannosyltransferase was dependent on the presence of a functional copy of the pimA gene carried on a temperature-sensitive rescue plasmid. We demonstrate here that the pimA mutant is unable to grow at the higher temperature at which the rescue plasmid is lost.

In Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacille de Calmette Guerin), PI and PIMs represent as much as 56% of all phospholipids in the cell wall and 37% of those in the cytoplasmic membrane and are, thus, regarded as important structural components acting as “cementing substances” for the cell wall skeleton (8Goren M.B.

Studies begun more than 30 years ago provide evidence that the early steps of PIM synthesis start with the transfer of a mannose residue from GDP-Man to the 2-position of themyo-inositol ring of PI to form phosphatidylinositol monomannosides (PIM1). This step is followed by the transfer of another mannose residue (Man) to the 6-position ofmyo-inositol to form phosphatidylinositol dimannosides (PIM2) (15Brennan P.J. Ballou C.E. J. Biol.

From PIM2, it is proposed that the Man residue in the 6-position of myo-inositol is further glycosylated with Man and then with Ara to form the higher forms of PIMs (PIM3-PIM6) and the highly branched lipoglycans lipomannan and lipoarabinomannan through reactions probably involving many different mannosyl- and arabinosyltransferases as well as nucleoside diphosphate- and polyprenyl phosphate-based sugar donors (14Besra G.S.

Recently, the pimB gene of M. tuberculosiswas characterized as encoding a α-d-mannose- α(1→6)-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol-monomannoside transferase that mediates the transfer of Man from GDP-Man to tri-acylated PIM1 (Ac3PIM1) to form tri-acylated PIM2 (Ac3PIM2) (18Schaeffer M.L.

The amino acid sequence of PimB contains the motif EXF(G/C)XXXXE found in bacterial retaining α-mannosyltransferases that catalyze the formation of glycosidic bonds using GDP-Man as the sugar donor (19Geremia R.A. Petroni A. Ielpi L. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This motif, which is proposed to be involved in the binding of GDP-Man, is found in four other M. tuberculosis-predicted proteins (20Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and likely to be involved in the synthesis of PIMs. The first ORF of this cluster (Rv2613c) encodes a protein of unknown function.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The third ORF (Rv2611c) encodes a protein with similarities to bacterial acyltransferases, and the fourth and fifth ORF encode, respectively, the putative α-mannosyltransferase (Rv2610c) and a putative GDP-mannose hydrolase (Rv2609c) carrying a MutT domain signature (PS00893) (21Frick D.N. Townsend B.D. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24086-24091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This genetic organization suggested that Rv2610c might encode a α-mannosyltransferase involved in the very early steps of PIM synthesis (9Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Rv2610c shares sequence similarity to many bacterial glycosyltransferases, is present in all the mycobacterial genomes sequenced so far, and has a homolog in Streptomyces coelicolor (51% identity on a 375 amino acid overlap), an actinomycete that shares with mycobacteria the ability to synthesize PIMs (22Brennan P.J. Ratledge C. Wilkinson S.G. Microbial Lipids. 1. Academic Press Ltd., London1988: 203-298Google Scholar).In this report, evidence is provided that Rv2610c is the α-d-mannose-α(1→2)-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol transferase responsible for the formation of Ac2PIM1 from GDP-Man and PI. Based on the name recently given to the mannosyltransferase responsible for the synthesis of Ac3PIM2 from Ac3PIM1(PimB) (18Schaeffer M.L. Khoo K.-H. Besra G.S. Chatterjee D. Brennan P.J. Belisle J.T.

Through the construction and analysis of a pimA conditional mutant of M. smegmatis, we demonstrate that PimA is essential for mycobacterial growth.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverexpression of the pimA Gene in M. smegmatisSub-cellular Localization of the PimA ProteinTheRv2610c gene from M. tuberculosis, which encodes a putative mannosyltransferase involved in the early steps of PIM synthesis, was renamed pimA. The pimA gene ofM. smegmatis was PCR-amplified and placed under control of the phsp60 promoter in the mycobacterial expression vector pVV16, yielding plasmid pVVpimA. Upon transformation of M. smegmatis mc2155 with this construct, colonies of mc2155/pVVpimA were obtained that exhibited an unusual glossy morphology instead of the dry morphology of wild type mc2155 or mc2155/pVV16 colonies. The growth rates of the mc2155/pVVpimA and mc2155/pVV16 recombinant strains were identical in LB-Km-Hyg-Tween 80 broth at 37 °C, although the strain overexpressing pimA showed an increased tendency to clump (data not shown). Production of recombinant PimA protein in mc2155/pVVpimA was checked by Western blot using a mouse monoclonal anti-His antibody. Large quantities of PimA recombinant protein of the expected size (∼40 kDa) were detected in crude extracts of mc2155/pVVpimA and found to be associated to the membrane and cytosol fractions (data not shown). The association of PimA with the membrane fraction is consistent with the prediction of at least one putative transmembrane segment from the amino acids 275–298 by the TMpred (www.ch.embnet.org) and DAS (www.sbc.su.se/∼miklos/DAS) transmembrane prediction programs. The uneven distribution of basic amino acid residues responsible for a high predicted pI of the N-terminal half of the protein (theoretical pI = 9.55 from residues 1 to 202) as compared with a theoretical pI of 5.10 for the C-terminal half of the protein (residues 203–378), may also reflect the ability of some N-terminal domains of PimA to interact with anionic phospholipids of the membrane. Finally, the association of PimA with the membrane fraction is consistent with the observed co-localization of the mannosyltransferase activity with the membrane fraction, as shown below. The important amounts of non-active recombinant PimA protein in the cytosol fraction of mc2155/pVVpimA are probably the results of overexpression.Overexpression of pimA Alters the PIM Composition of M. smegmatisThe PIM composition of the mc2155/pVV16 and mc2155/pVVpimA strains was analyzed by metabolic labeling with myo-[2-3H]inositol. Overexpression ofpimA in M. smegmatis resulted in an increased production of PIM2, particularly Ac3PIM2, relative to PI (Fig.1a). The spots corresponding to PI, Ac4PIM2, and Ac3PIM2 (Fig. 1a) were scraped off and counted for radioactivity. The ratio of PI to the two forms of PIM2 combined was 1:2.2 in the control strain mc2155/pVV16 and 1:13.6 in the overproducing strain mc2155/pVVpimA. Changes in the PI to PIM2 ratio were further confirmed by MALDI-MS analysis in the negative ion mode of the phospholipid-containing fraction obtained after chloroform/water partition and acetone precipitation (Fig. 1b). All the peaks observed in the mass spectra were assigned to deprotonated molecular ions [M-H]−. The mass spectra show a clear increase in the PIM2 content (m/z = 1175.6 for Ac2PIM2 with C16/C19; m/z = 1413.8 for Ac3PIM2 with 2C16/C19; m/z = 1652.1 and 1694.2 for Ac4PIM2 with 3C16/C19 and 2C16/2C19, respectively) and PIM6 content (m/z = 2062.1 for Ac3PIM6 with 2C16/C19;m/z = 2462.4 and 2504.4 for Ac4PIM6 with 3C16/C19and 2C16/2C19, respectively) relative to PI (m/z = 851.6 for Ac2PI with C16/C19) of the strain expressing the recombinant PimA protein. These results suggested that PimA is involved in the metabolic pathway producing PIM2 and PIM6.Overexpression of pimA Alters M. smegmatis Sensitivity to AmpicillinThe low permeability of the mycobacterial cell envelope and, subsequently, the high intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to chemotherapeutic agents are believed to be a result of the unusual structure and composition of the cell envelope (28Jarlier V. Nikaido H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 123: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Because PIMs represent major components of the cell envelope, we investigated whether alterations in the PIM composition of mc2155/pVVpimA affected its sensitivity to drugs. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of three antibiotics against mc2155/pVVpimA and mc2155/pVV16 were measured. Both strains exhibited identical resistance to isoniazid (3 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) (hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, respectively), but mc2155/pVVpimA showed higher resistance to ampicillin, a hydrophilic β-lactam (minimal inhibitory concentration = 300–400 μg/ml as compared with 100 μg/ml for the control strain). This result is in good agreement with the observation by Parish and co-workers (29Parish T. Liu J. Nikaido H. Stoker N.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7827-7833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that a M. smegmatis mutant with decreased amounts of PIM2 in its envelope was more sensitive to ampicillin.Overproduction of PimA in M. smegmatis Stimulates the Formation of Ac2PIM1 and Ac3PIM1 in Cell-free AssaysAn enzymatic system associated to the membrane fraction ofMycobacterium phlei and capable of forming PIM1from GDP-Man was initially described by Hill and Ballou (16Hill D.L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 895-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GDP-Man was shown to be the only effective mannose donor in this system. In the present study, the mannosyltransferase activities of mc2155/pVV16 and mc2155/pVVpimA were compared in a cell-free assay based on that described for M. phlei. In this assay, a whole array of mannose-containing lipids, including polyprenol-based mannolipids and PIMs, are synthesized. Changes in the lipid profiles of the PimA-overproducing strain as compared with the control strain would suggest an involvement of PimA in a metabolic pathway leading to mannose-containing lipids. Because the recombinant PimA protein was found in the cytosol and membranes of the overproducing strain mc2155/pVVpimA, we first tested these two fractions independently or in combination for mannosyltransferase activity. The radioactive profiles of the lipids obtained after incubation of membranes with GDP-[14C]Man showed a clear accumulation of two mannolipids (mannolipids 1 and 2) migrating in the PIM region of the TLC in the case of mc2155/pVVpimA (Fig.2, lane 2). The reactions performed with the cytosol of the control and overproducing strains yielded identical radioactive lipid profiles (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 4). Almost no mannolipid 1 and no mannolipid 2 could be detected when using the cytosol fraction, even when mycobacterial PI (∼15 μm) was added to the reaction mixture (data not shown). The formation of small amounts of polyprenyl phosphomannose and Ac3PIM2 in the cytosol fraction is likely the result of a contamination of this fraction with traces of membrane. Combining the membrane and cytosol fractions did not increase significantly the synthesis of mannolipid 1, although slightly higher amounts of mannolipid 2 were detected in both the control and overexpressing strains (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). Thus, despite of the fact that PimA is present in the cytosol of M. smegmatis mc2155/pVVpimA, the mannosyltransferase activity of this protein is associated only with the membrane fraction. Initial characterization of the two accumulated mannolipids confirmed that they are mild-acid stable and mild-alkali labile, indicating that they are members of the PIM family (data not shown). Further analysis by MALDI-MS of the total lipids from reaction mixtures in which radioactive GDP-[14C]Man was replaced by cold GDP-Man revealed the presence of two compounds corresponding to Ac2PIM1 ([M-H]−, m/z = 1013.6) and Ac3PIM1 ([M-H]−, m/z = 1251.9) in mc2155/pVVpimA that were not detected in mc2155/pVV16 (data not shown). To characterize the mannolipids 1 and 2, non-radioactive products from cold reactions were partially purified by preparative TLC and subjected to MALDI-MS analysis. The mass spectrum for the mannolipid 1-containing sample shows the presence of the major product atm/z = 1013.6, corresponding to Ac2PIM1 with C16/C19(Fig. 3a), contaminated by traces of co-purified PIMs (Ac2PIM2, Ac3PIM2, and Ac3PIM3). Mannolipid 2-containing sample afforded predominant deprotonated molecular ions at m/z = 1251.9, corresponding to Ac3PIM1 with 2C16/C19 (Fig. 3b). Therefore, the major radiolabeled product of the reaction catalyzed by PimA in M. smegmatis is Ac2PIM1. Part of this product is presumably acylated into Ac3PIM1.FIG. 2Effect of overexpressing pimAon the in vitro incorporation of GDP-[14C]Man into mannolipids.

In vitro enzymatic reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Membrane (M) and cytosol (C) fractions of mc2155/pVV16 and mc2155/pVVpimA or the combination of these two fractions (M+C) were used as the source of enzyme. Lipids were extracted, and 5% of the labeled material from each reaction was applied to TLC plates and developed with CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65:25:0.5:4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)FIG. 3MALDI-MS analysis of mannolipid 1 (a) and mannolipid 2 (b) producedin vitro by membranes of mc2155/pVVpimA. Cold cell-free assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Incubation lasted for 32 h. The lipids from six reactions were extracted and combined, and mannolipids 1 and 2 were isolated by preparative TLC using the radiolabeled mannolipids as markers. MALDI-MS was operated in the negative ion mode. Peaks observed are m/z1013.6, Ac2PIM1 with C16/C19; m/z 1133.6 and 1175.6, Ac2PIM2 with 2C16 and C16/C19, respectively;m/z 1251.9, Ac3PIM1 with 2C16/C19; m/z 1413.8, Ac3PIM2 with 2C16/C19;m/z 1576.0, Ac3PIM3 with 2C16/C19; m/z 1652.1 and 1694.2, Ac4PIM2 with 3C16/C19 and 2C16/2C19, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)PimA Catalyzes the Formation of Ac2PIM1 in E. coli Cell-free AssaysThe function of the PimA protein was further studied in crude extracts of E. coli BL21/pETpimA overexpressingpimA. Because E. coli does not produce any PI, no background mannosyltransferase and acyltransferase activities on PI or derived products were expected in these extracts. In the reaction mixture, commercial bovine PI (carrying primarily stearate (C18:0) and arachidonate (C20:4) fatty acyl chains) and GDP-[14C]Man served as the substrates for the predicted reaction, PI + GDP-[14C]Man → Ac2PI[14C]M1 + GDP, catalyzed by the recombinant PimA protein. In the presence of crude extract fromE. coli BL21/pETpimA but not in that of crude extract from BL21/pET14b, a single product was formed (Fig.4, lanes 3–4). Its synthesis was strictly dependent upon the addition of PI to the reaction mixture (Fig. 4, lanes 1–4). This product migrated with a similar Rf to Ac2PIM1, produced in the M. smegmatis cell-free assays (Fig 4, lanes 5 and 6). A slight shift in TLC mobility of this product can be attributed to the difference in acyl groups of mycobacterial PI (containing C16/C19) compared with commercial bovine PI. MALDI-MS analysis of the total lipids from reaction mixtures in which radioactive GDP-[14C]Man was replaced by cold GDP-Man showed that the only detected PIM corresponded to Ac2PIM1 (with peaks atm/z = 1025.7 and m/z = 1049.7) in BL21/pETpimA (Fig.5), which were not detected in BL21/pET14b. It is obvious that these compounds arose from PI (m/z = 863.6; m/z= 887.6) by the addition of a single hexose (i.e. mannose). Duplicity of the peaks on the spectrum is due to heterogeneity of commercial PI, which is claimed to contain primarily, but not exclusively, stearate and arachidonate fatty acyl chains.FIG. 4Ac2PIM1 synthesis by a recombinant PimA protein produced in E.coli.

Only the major species of each family are marked. The peak atm/z 885.6 is attributed to Ac2PI with C18/C20:4. Peaks at m/z887.6 could then be tentatively attributed to Ac2PI with C18/C20:3 and m/z 861.6 and 863.6 to Ac2PI with 2C18:1 and C18/C18:1 respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Altogether, the results obtained from the M. smegmatis and E. coli cell-free assays provide evidence that the PimA enzyme of M. smegmatis catalyzes the transfer of the first Man residue from GDP-Man to the myo-inositol residue of PI, yielding Ac2PIM1. Because earlier work (16Hill D.L. Ballou C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 895-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Takayama K. Goldman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1969; 176: 196-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) clearly showed that the very first transfer of a Man residue onto PI in PIM synthesis occurred at the 2-position of myo-inositol, we therefore conclude that PimA is a α-d-mannose-α(1→2)-phosphatidyl-myo-inositol transferase.pimA Is an Essential Gene of M. smegmatisConstruction of a pimA Conditional Mutant of M. smegmatisTo address the question of the essentiality of the mannosyltransferase PimA in mycobacteria, we constructed a pimA conditional mutant of M. smegmatis. Essentially the same strategy was used to construct this mutant as was used to construct apgsA conditional mutant (9Jackson M. Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30092-30099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). It uses a two-step homologous recombination procedure to achieve allelic exchange at thepimA locus (30Jackson M. Camacho L.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Parish T. Stocker N.G. Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Protocols. 54. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 59-75Google Scholar) and a mycobacterial temperature-sensitive rescue plasmid to perform complementation experiments (27Guilhot C. Otal I. Van Rompaey I. Martı̀n C. Gicquel B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 535-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A kanamycin-disrupted copy of the pimA gene, pimA::Km, and the xylEreporter gene were inserted into the sacB suicide vector pJQ200, yielding pJQpimA. pJQpimA was introduced into the wild typeM. smegmatis mc2155 by electroporation, and kanamycin-resistant transformants were selected on LB-Km plates at 37 °C. A Southern blot analysis performed on the DNA of 18 of these transformants indicated that 14 resulted from a single homologous recombination event at the pimA locus (data not shown). Two, mc2pJQpimA.1 and mc2pJQpimA.2, were selected for the subsequent steps of the experiment. The other four transformants, analyzed by Southern blotting, arose from illegitimate recombination. mc2pJQpimA.1 and mc2pJQpimA.2 were grown in LB-Km broth and then plated onto LB-Km-Suc to select for clones that had undergone a second intra-chromosomal crossover leading to the excision of the body of vector and to allelic replacement. Allelic exchange mutants are expected to carry the disrupted allelepimA::Km and to have lost thesacB and xylE genes carried by pJQpimA. Therefore, allelic exchange mutants should be resistant to kanamycin and to sucrose and remain white upon spraying with catechol (i.e. XylE negative). Spraying of thousands of kanamycin-sucrose resistant colonies with catechol revealed that none of them exhibited the expected phenotype for allelic exchange mutants. Instead, these clones had probably undergone some mutations in thesacB gene that conferred upon them resistance to sucrose. To investigate whether the failure to disrupt the pimA gene in this first experiment could be due to the essentiality of that gene, we next proceeded to the construction of a pimA conditional mutant.For this purpose, the single crossover strain m"

CSPs are shorter (110–115 amino acids) than PBP or GOBP, contain only 4 conserved cysteines forming two disulfide bridges (9Angeli S. Ceron F. Scaloni A. Monti M. Monteforti G. Minnocci A.

They may also play a role in the transport of hydrophobic chemicals (volatile or not) from air or water to olfactory or taste receptors in a similar way as other transport proteins such as GOBPs or PBPs. However, the exact physiological role of CSPs has still to be identified. In the moth Mamestra brassicae, several CSPs have been identified in the proboscis (12Nagnan-Le Meillour P. Cain A.H.

In the proboscis, however, a putative role of odor or taste carriers has been assigned to CSPs (12Nagnan-Le Meillour P. Cain A.H. Jacquin-Joly E. François M.C. Ramachandran S. Maida R.

To improve our knowledge of these important insect proteins, we have expressed in the Escherichia coli periplasm CSPMbraA6 originating from the antennae of M. brassicae (14Campanacci V. Mosbah A.

CSPMbraA6 NMR preliminary assignment and crystallization have already been published (14Campanacci V. Mosbah A. Bornet O. Wechselberger R. Jacquin-Joly E. Cambillau C. Darbon H. Tegoni M. Eur. J.

Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The present paper is the first report of a CSP structure and of its preliminary functional characterization. We describe the three-dimensional x-ray structure of CSPMbraA6, which displays a novel fold, and fluorescence binding studies with 12-bromododecanol and brominated fatty acids. CSPMbraA6 is able to bind these compounds with good affinity. Based on these results, we hypothesize its putative function as a lipid carrier. A detailed description of the molecular cloning, expression, purification, and characterization of CSPMbraA6 has previously been reported (14Campanacci V. Mosbah A. Bornet O. Wechselberger R. Jacquin-Joly E. Cambillau C. Darbon H. Tegoni M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4731-4739Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Expression of selenomethionine-substituted CSPMbraA6 was performed using the methionine pathway inhibition method (16Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria were grown to midlog phase in minimal medium before addition of the following amino acids: lysine, phenylalanine, and threonine at 100 mg/ml, isoleucine, leucine, and valine at 50 mg/ml, and selenomethionine at 50 mg/ml. Induction thereafter carried on for 30 min in the same conditions as described above for the expression of mutants. Mass spectrometry was performed to confirm the substitution of the unique Met in CSPMbraA6. Crystals of CSP2 were obtained using two different conditions (15Campanacci V. Spinelli S. Lartigue A. Lewandowski C. Brown K. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 137-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Crystals of form 1 belong to the P43212 space group with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 69.4 Å, c = 79.6 Å and contain 1 molecule per asymmetric unit whereas crystals of form 2 belong to a monoclinic space groupP21 with unit cell dimensions ofa = 47.6 Å, b = 49.7 Å, c = 50.3 Å, β = 110.1° and contain 2 molecules per asymmetric unit. Crystals of selenomethionyl protein were obtained in an identical fashion as the native crystals but needed seeding using small native crystals. For data collection, crystals were flash frozen at 100 K in their mother liquor without cryoprotectant. The x-ray fluorescence from each crystal was measured as a function of the incident x-ray energy in the vicinity of the Se-K edge. In the case of the tetragonal form, a three-wavelength MAD data experiment was carried out on the BM-14 beamline at ESRF (Grenoble). The wavelengths chosen for the data collection were 0.978878 Å (12.666 keV) and 0.979095 Å (12.663 keV) corresponding to maximumf″ and minimum f′, respectively. A third remote energy was selected at 13.5 keV (λ = 0.918397 Å). In the case of the monoclinic crystal, a SAD experiment was performed on the ID-29 beamline at ESRF at a wavelength of 0.9789 Å (12.666 keV) corresponding to the maximum f″. Each time, data were collected from a single crystal in an arbitrary setting using a MAR-CCD detector (BM-14) or a ADSC Quantum 4 detector (ID-29) after optimizing the oscillation range using STRATEGY (17Ravelli R.B.G.

Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The experimental MAD electron density maps were improved by solvent flattening using DM (22Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The CSPMbraA6 was built manually using the MAKE FRAG and TPPR options in Turbo-Frodo (23Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphis Geometry Partners Directory. 81. Mountain View, CA1991: 77-78Google Scholar). In the case of form 2 the native Patterson function calculated at 1.8-Å resolution contained a large peak in the y = 0.5 section that was 8% of the height of the origin peak. This peak persisted in the anomalous difference Patterson calculated with the peak absorption diffraction data. Because of the special nature of the non-crystallographic translational symmetry, extra care was needed to solve the selenium structure. Heavy atom refinement and phasing were carried out in MLPHARE (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), and solvent-flattened maps were generated with DM (22Cowtan K. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar); the main chain was traced with wARP (24Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2565) Google Scholar). The map was of sufficient clarity not to require non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. Therefore, one of the two molecules was selected for fitting the sequence using O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar), and the other was generated by the application of the non-crystallographic symmetry operator. Refinement of both models was performed with CNS (26Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Cambillau C. Silicon Graphis Geometry Partners Directory. 81. Mountain View, CA1991: 77-78Google Scholar). Protein geometry was assessed using PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) showing 91 and 94.1% residues in the most favorable region and 9 and 5.9% in the additional allowed region for forms 1 and 2, respectively. The models of the ligands were built with Turbo-Frodo using standard stereochemical parameters. The CSPMbraA6 Tyr-26 side chain χ1 angle was rotated toward the surface by 100° to form the continuous internal channel, and the ligands were docked manually. Brominated compounds and pheromones were obtained from Chemtech BV (The Netherlands) and from Sigma. 100% methanolic solutions were freshly prepared. Fluorescence quenching was measured using a Cary Eclipse (Varian). Fluorescence measurements were made in a right angle configuration at 20 °C by using 2.5-nm excitation and 10-nm emission bandwidths. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the emission spectra were measured between 290 and 540 nm. In all experiments the final methanol concentration in the cuvette was kept below 1%. Samples contained 1 μmprotein in 10 mm Tris buffer, 25 mm NaCl, pH 8.0; ligands were used at concentrations between 0.02 and 22.5 μm. To estimate the affinity of brominated compounds to CSPMbraA6, the fluorescence intensities at 343 nm at increasing concentrations of quencher were plotted versus the quencher concentration. TheKd values were estimated by non-linear regression using Prism 3.02 (GraphPad Software, Inc.). CSPMbraA6 has an overall globular shape with dimensions of 25 × 30 × 32 Å and consists of six helices connected by α-α loops (Fig.1a). In crystal form 1 and in the monomer B of crystal form 2, the polypeptide chain is visible from residue 11 to residue 112, whereas in monomer A of crystal form 2, the chain starts at residue 4. The remaining N-terminal residues are probably disordered in the crystal. The helices correspond to residues 5 (or 12)–18 (helix A), 20–30 (B), 38–53 (C), 60–76 (D), 78–88 (E), and 93–105 (F) (Fig. 1a). Two disulfide bridges close small loops because they are formed by cysteines 29 and 36 and cysteines 55 and 58 (Fig. 1a), similar to what was proposed for the CSP of Schistocerca gregaria (9Angeli S. Ceron F. Scaloni A. Monti M. Monteforti G. Minnocci A. Petacchi R. Pelosi P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). No comparable fold has been found in the Protein Data Bank using DALI (28Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar), indicating that the six helices are arranged in an original way. Helices A and B (residues 6–30) as well as helices D and E (residues 60–88) form two V-shaped structures, with opening angles of ∼60° (Fig. 1, b and c). The planes defined by the two V-shaped structures are parallel and about 12 Å apart. Helix C is perpendicular to these two planes and positioned in between the four ends of the two V-shaped structures (Fig. 1, b and c). The final helix (F) is located packed against the external face of the D–E helices and does not take part in the core assembly. Aside from the N termini, the Cα chains of the different protein forms or monomers are very similar. A RMSD of 0.44 Å is observed between the Cα atoms common to monomers A and B of form 2, and a RMSD of 0.64 Å is observed between the Cα atoms of crystal form 1 and monomer A of crystal form 2. A few significant differences are observed in some side chain orientations, however (see below). The sequence of CSPMbraA6 contains 16 Glu, 7 Asp, 14 Lys, and 6 Arg residues, accounting for 39% of the total amino acid content. All of these charged residues are located at the protein surface. Aromatic and aliphatic residues, accounting for 30% of the total amino acid content, form the core of the protein and the walls of the internal channel (see below); only a few of these hydrophobic residues are located near the protein surface. The high content of charged residues and the absence of hydrophobic patch at the protein surface explain well the monomeric nature of CSPMbraA6 and its outstanding solubility. A narrow channel, starting from the surface region between residues 6–10 (helix A) and residues 62–68 (helix D), extends 14 Å within the core of monomer A of form 2 between the two V-shaped structures (Fig. 2, a and b). Six ordered water molecules are visible in this channel at hydrogen bonding distances from each other (Fig. 2, a and b). They contact, from outside to inside, Arg-68, Asn-10, Asn-61, Leu-13, Asp-9, His-46, Glu-62, Gly-65, Ala-66, Leu-43, Val-69, Leu-47, and Tyr-26. One side of the channel is formed by helix A (residues 5–18) and is stabilized by a crystal contact between Tyr-8 and Glu-39 of a symmetry-related molecule. The side chain of Tyr-26 forms the bottom of the channel, preventing its continuity with a nearby internal cavity (Fig. 2, a and b). In monomer B, the disorder of the peptidic segment 1–10 results in a large opening at the position of the beginning of the channel in monomer A (Fig. 2, c and d). NMR studies indicate that this segment is also disordered in solution. 2A. Mosbah, V. Campanacci, A. Lartique, M. Tegoni, C. Cambillau, and H. Darbon, submitted for publication. The Tyr-26 side chain is rotated by 100° around the χ1 angle toward the protein surface, and the position of its hydroxyl group in monomer A is occupied by the side chain of Leu-43. As a result of these side chain rotations, the channel is much shorter, and a closed cavity starts in monomer B where the channel stops in monomer A. We hypothesize that, upon ligand binding, the Tyr-26 side chain might be rotated toward the protein surface as in monomer B. Consequently, applying to monomer A the rotation of Tyr-26 observed in monomer B makes it possible to form a continuous internal channel starting from the surface and about 20 Å deep. This narrow and elongated channel seems suitable for alkyl compound binding, a hypothesis tested below. As AMA has been widely used in binding assays with mammalian lipocalins (30Ramoni R. Vincent F. Grolli S. Conti V.V. Malosse C. Boyer F.D. Nagnan-Le Meillour P. Spinelli S. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and insect PBPs (31Campanacci V. Krieger J. Bette S. Sturgis J.N. Lartigue A. Cambillau C. Breer H. Tegoni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20078-20084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we initially attempted to use this fluorescent probe to determine the affinity of various ligands to CSPMbraA6. Unfortunately, no fluorescence increase was observed upon addition of AMA to a solution of CSPMbraA6 (data not shown), indicating that AMA does not bind in the internal hydrophobic channel. This was not surprising considering the bulkiness of the anthracene moiety and the small radius of CSPMbraA6 channel. As bromine has been reported as an excellent long range quencher of tryptophan fluorescence (32De Foresta B. Legros N. Plusquellec D., Le Maire M. Champeil P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we decided to perform binding assays with linear compounds bearing a bromine atom: 12-bromo-dodecanol, 15-bromo-pentadecanoic acid, and 9-bromo-stearic acid (named C12Br, C15Br, and C18Br, respectively). In the presence of saturating concentrations of these compounds, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of CSPMbraA6 was quenched at 26, 34, and 30%, respectively (Fig. 3, A–C), which suggests that at least one of the two tryptophans interacts with the ligand. This decrease in fluorescence intensity was associated with a blue shift of the emission maximum, from 343 to 339 nm with C12Br and to 332 nm with C15Br and C18Br, indicating that the tryptophan environment becomes probably more hydrophobic upon ligand binding. To determine the affinity of CSPMbraA6 for the three ligands, the fluorescence quenching at 342 nm was measured as a function of ligand concentration, and the dissociation constant was estimated by non-linear regression of the binding curve (Fig. 3, A–C). The Kd values determined were 0.90, 1.60, and 0.35 μm, respectively, in the range of values observed for PBP-pheromone complexes (31Campanacci V. Krieger J. Bette S. Sturgis J.N. Lartigue A. Cambillau C. Breer H. Tegoni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20078-20084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 33Bette S. Breer H. Krieger J. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 32: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The x-ray structure and the positive binding assays prompted us to model the interaction between the ligands and CSPMbraA6. We performed a small rotation of the side chain of Tyr-26, which extends the length of the hydrophobic channel to ∼20 Å inside the protein (see above). The three brominated ligands used in fluorescence experiments were modeled and docked in the cavity with the OH or COOH moieties pointing out of the channel. In this orientation, C12Br is fully imbedded in the channel while the carboxylic moieties of the C15Br and C18Br reach the protein surface and the bulk solvent (Fig. 3D). The three ligands fit well in the narrow channel in an elongated way for most of the alkyl chain, a kink being induced at the level of carbons 5–6 by a change in the channel direction. These ligand positions with the hydrophilic group turned to the outside are also in agreement with the hydrophobic character of the channel. The bromine atoms of the ligands are closer to the Trp-81 indole rings (8, 8, and 11 Å, respectively) than to Trp-94 (16, 16, and 15 Å, respectively). This orientation accounts well for the fluorescence of Trp-81 being mostly quenched. The three-dimensional structures of several classes of small lipid transport proteins have been solved to date and have diverse structural frameworks. Two families (34Newcomer M.E. Jones T.A.

J. 1996; 318: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar) employ anti-parallel β-barrels to form internal, variable shaped internal cavities that accommodate the often hydrophobic ligands. By changing the residues inside of such barrels, a wide range of specificities can be achieved. In contrast, CSPMbraA6 has an all α-helical structure. Several other proteins capable of accommodating lipids also have an all helical structure: LTPs (37Gincel E. Simorre J.P. Caille A. Marion D. Ptak M. Vovelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 38Shin D.H. Lee J.Y. Hwang K.Y. Kim K.K. Suh S.W.

Biol. 1995; 25: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and PBPs (40Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar,41Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). LTPs are small proteins (around 100 amino acids) that facilitate the transfer of lipids through membranes. In their structure, four helices delineate a cavity extending through the entire molecule (37Gincel E. Simorre J.P. Caille A. Marion D. Ptak M. Vovelle F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,38Shin D.H. Lee J.Y. Hwang K.Y. Kim K.K. Suh S.W.

B1 and B2 proteins, secreted in the tubular accessory glands of the adult male mealworm beetle Tenebrio molitor, have been proposed to be lipid carriers able to keep hydrophobic compounds in solution in the aqueous seminal fluid (39Paesen G.C. Happ G.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NMR studies of THP12, a protein from T. molitor homologous to B1/B2, revealed a structure of six α-helices and demonstrated that THP12 binds fatty acids (nonanoic acid and octanoic acid) as well as the specific pheromones of T. molitor, 4-methylnonanol, and ergosterol (42Rothemund S. Liou Y.C. Davies P.L. Krause E. Sonnichsen F.D. Structure. 1999; 7: 1325-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The structure of Bombyx mori PBP has revealed the presence of six helices delineating a cavity that contains the pheromone, bombykol (40Sandler B.H. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Clardy J. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Bombykol, an unsaturated alcohol, presents a bent conformation, reminiscent of fatty acids in fatty acid binding proteins (43Balendiran G.K. Schnutgen F. Scapin G. Borchers T. Xhong N. Lim K. Godbout R. Spener F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27045-27054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At acidic pH, the cavity of the apo-PBP is filled by the C-terminal segment in helical conformation (41Horst R. Damberger F. Luginbuhl P. Guntert P. Peng G. Nikonova L. Leal W.S. Wuthrich K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14374-14379Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). As far as the binding properties of PBPs are concerned, it is important to remember that some PBPs have also revealed strong affinities with non-pheromonal compounds such as alkyl alcohols and fatty acids (31Campanacci V. Krieger J. Bette S. Sturgis J.N. Lartigue A. Cambillau C. Breer H. Tegoni M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20078-20084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The relative arrangement of the helices differs greatly among all these α-helical proteins, including CSPMbraA6. The ligand-accommodating region is also different as THP12 exhibits an elongated groove located at the protein surface whereas PBPs and LTPs possess an internal cavity, as in the case of CSPMbraA6. In contrast with PBPs, the narrow and rather elongated channels of CSPs seem to be conveniently designed to select only aliphatic ligands. The structure and binding properties of an insect chemosensory protein are reported here for the first time. Our results clearly point to a lipid transport function for CSPMbraA6. Lipids are poorly soluble in the fluids from antenna or other organs containing CSPMbraA6 but are most probably dispersed in the phospholipidic membrane. We hypothesize therefore that CSPMbraA6 should interact with membranes to extract pheromones or other lipidic compounds dispersed in the hydrophobic membrane matrix and bring them to their specific target. Whether the N-terminal segment is the trigger of this interaction in a comparable way as the C-terminal helix of PBP remains to be explored."

Analysis of the intracellular itinerary of MLN64 and MLN64 mutants tagged with green fluorescent protein showed that the N-terminal transmembrane domains mediate endocytosis of MLN64 from the plasma membrane to late endocytic compartments. MLN64 constitutively traffics via dynamic NPC1-containing late endosomal tubules in normal cells; this dynamic movement was inhibited in cholesterol-loaded cells, and MLN64 is trapped at the periphery of cholesterol-laden lysosomes. The MLN64 START domain stimulated free cholesterol transfer from donor to acceptor mitochondrial membranes and enhanced steroidogenesis by placental mitochondria. Expression of a truncated form of MLN64 (ΔSTART-MLN64), which contains N-terminal transmembrane domains but lacks the START domain, caused free cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes and inhibited late endocytic dynamics. The ΔSTART-MLN64 dominant negative protein was located at the surface of the cholesterol-laden lysosomes. This dominant negative mutant suppressed steroidogenesis in COS cells expressing the mitochondrial cholesterol side chain cleavage system. We conclude that MLN64 participates in mobilization and utilization of lysosomal cholesterol by virtue of the START domain’s role in cholesterol transport.

Although NPC1and NPC2 are required for egress of lysosomal cholesterol, the mechanism by which cholesterol is removed from the late endocytic pathway, a dynamic tubular network that communicates with lysosomes, is not known. The mysteries of lysosomal cholesterol transport began to be unraveled when the gene responsible for the majority of cases of NPC disease,NPC1, was cloned (3Carstea E.D. Morris J.A. Coleman K.G.

The critical role of another protein, HE1, in clearing cholesterol out of lysosomes was established when it was discovered that the HE1 gene is mutated in the second and less frequent form of Niemann-Pick type C disease and is, therefore, the NPC2 gene.

Recently, MLN64, a protein that contains a C-terminal StAR-related lipid transfer (START) domain was found to reside in late endosomes and lysosomes (10Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B.

The N terminus of MLN64 consists of a 6-amino acid leader sequence and four anchoring transmembrane domains (10Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The START domain binds cholesterol and can stimulate sterol transfer between membranes (10Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F.

The topology of MLN64 in late endosomal membranes predicts that the START domain projects into the cytoplasm, where it is positioned to effect cholesterol transfer to opposing membranes (12Alpy F. Stoeckel M.E. Dierich A. Escola J.M. Wendling C. Chenard M.P. Vanier M.T. Gruenberg J. Tomasetto C. Rio M.C. J. Biol.

The location of a START domain protein in late endocytic pathway with NPC1 and HE1 suggests that MLN64 is a component of the machinery that facilitates cholesterol egress from lysosomes. To investigate this possibility, we elucidated the trafficking, in living cells, of wild type and mutant MLN64 proteins fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP). We found that a truncated MLN64 without the START domain (ΔSTART-MLN64) is a dominant negative mutant. The dominant negative action of this mutant caused extensive cholesterol accumulation in CHO cells and COS-7 cells accompanied by inhibition of late endosomal tubular trafficking, similar to the NPC phenotype that is caused by loss of function of NPC1 and NPC2 (3Carstea E.D.

This dominant negative mutant also inhibited steroidogenesis in cells. An in vitro assay provided evidence that the START domain mediates cholesterol transfer between membranes and stimulates mitochondrial metabolism of cholesterol into steroid hormones. These findings strongly suggest that MLN64 plays a role in the maintenance of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. The human MLN64 cDNA has been previously described (10Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8462-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). MLN64 cDNA encoding either full-length or specific domains of the MLN64 protein were fused to the green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-N2; CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). All of the cDNAs used in making these fluorescent fusion proteins were generated by PCR using either Pfu or TaqDNA polymerases. The PCR primer pair used for the MLN64-GFP (forward, ATTAGAATTCATGAGCAAGCTGCCCAGGGAG; reverse, TAATGTCGACTGATGCGCTGTCGCAGGTGAAAG) spanned the cDNA encoding for amino acids 1–436 of the human MLN64 protein. The MLN64-CFP was constructed by replacing the GFP of MLN64-GFP with CFP from pECFP-N2 (CLONTECH). The START domain for MLN64 (amino acids 216–445) was also PCR- amplified and fused to the GFP vector. A shared forward PCR primer (ATTAGAATTCCGCCACCATGGGGTCTGACAATGAATCAGATG) for generation of the GFP construct was used with the START-MLN64-GFP-specific reverse primer (TAATGTCGACTGATGCGCTGTCGCAGGTGAAAG). The ΔSTART-MLN64-GFP fusion protein was generated by restriction digestion with XmnI andSmaI and gel isolation of the vector DNA plus cDNA encoding amino acids 1–225 followed by ligation of the blunt ends to form the ΔSTART-MLN64-GFP construct. All constructs were sequenced and compared with the human MLN64 cDNA sequence (GenBankTM accession numbers NM 006438 and NM 006445, respectively). The human StAR-RFP fusion protein was constructed with the RFP tag pDsRed1 N1 vector (CLONTECH) on the C terminus of the full-length coding sequence of StAR. The human NPC1-YFP fusion protein was constructed by inserting NPC1 together with the six-histidine linker from vector pNES6 (7Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Love D.C. Cooney A. Comly M. Neufeld E.

The function of NPC1-YFP was confirmed by analyzing cholesterol clearance in CT60 cells using filipin staining (data not shown). The F2 expression plasmid, which encodes a fusion protein consisting of the P450 side chain cleavage enzyme and its electron donor (adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase) partners (15Harikrishna J.A.

These cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). COS-1 cells were plated at 30,000 cells/well in 12-well plates on day 0. On day 1, cells were transfected with FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) plus plasmid DNA in the presence of serum as described in the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were co-transfected overnight with 250 ng of each of the 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and F2 expression plasmids and 500 ng of the GFP fusion vectors. On day 2, medium was changed to Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Some cultures were incubated with (22R)-hydroxycholesterol, a soluble steroidogenic substrate, to assess maximal hormone production (10Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C.

After 24 h, medium was collected and frozen at −20 °C until steroid analysis (see “Progesterone Assays”), and cells were harvested for protein determinations. To examine utilization of LDL-derived cholesterol, human LDL was reconstituted with [3H]cholesterol linoleate by the method of Krieger et al. (17Krieger M. Brown M.S. Faust J.R. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4093-4101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with the various MLN64 constructs and the steroidogenic enzymes as described above were cultured in medium supplemented with 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum and 50 μg of protein/ml (70 μg of cholesterol/ml)-reconstituted LDL (0.85 × 105 dpm/μg of cholesterol). The culture medium was collected 40 h later, and radiolabeled progesterone was isolated as described by Soto et al. (18Soto E. Silavin S.L. Tureck R.W. Strauss III, J.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1984; 58: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Wild type CHO cells, CT60 CHO cells, and COS-7 cells were used for microscopic analysis. Cells were maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium (CHO cell lines) or McCoy’s medium (COS-7 cells and fibroblasts) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Before transfection, cells were seeded in LabTek chambered coverslips and grown for 20 h to achieve ∼60% confluence before transfection. All of the cell lines were transfected using FuGENE6 according to the manufacturer’s instructions with some modification. For each chamber of the two-chamber coverslips, cells were incubated with mixtures containing 1 μg of DNA and 4 μl of FuGENE6 reagent in 400 μl of Ham’s F-12 medium for 5 h followed by culture in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing Ham’s F-12 medium. Transfected cells were either imaged as live cells at different times of expression of the transfected cDNAs or as fixed cells (in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min) stained with 50 mg/ml filipin (Polysciences, Warrington, PA) to examine lysosomal cholesterol content (7Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Love D.C. Cooney A. Comly M. Neufeld E. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4466-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For live cell imaging, cells were grown on chambered coverslips (LabTek), and temperature was maintained using a combination of a heating stage and an Objective Heater System (Bioptechs, Butler, PA). Medium samples from transfected cells were assayed using progesterone Coat-A-Count tubes and reagents (Diagonistic Products Corp., Los Angeles, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Statistical tests were performed using the JMP 3.1.5 computer program (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the effect of the expression plasmids on steroidogenic activity. Tukey-Kramer mean separation tests were performed for comparison between the means with p < 0.05 taken as the level of significance. Western blotting was used to confirm expression of the GFP fusion proteins and the coupling of GFP to the MLN64 sequences. The rabbit MLN64 antiserum was generated against recombinant MLN64 START domain as a His6 fusion protein (see below). An antiserum to GFP was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Western blotting was carried out as described by Watariet al. (10Watari H. Arakane F. Moog-Lutz C. Kallen C.B. Tomasetto C. Gerton G.L. Rio M.C. Baker M.E. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

The human MLN64 START domain (amino acid residues 216–445) was expressed in Escherichia coli as a His6 tag protein with the tag on the START domain C terminus using a pET vector, and the protein was purified using previously described methods (13Tsujishita Y.

Preliminary studies demonstrated that steroidogenic mitochondria from bovine corpus luteum or human placenta also served as equivalently effective acceptor membranes for START domain-stimulated sterol transfer. Transfer of [3H]triolein incorporated into the liposomes was measured to correct for liposome fusion or trapping. The sterol transfer activity of recombinant MLN64 START domain was compared with that of sterol carrier protein 2. Preparations enriched in syncytiotrophoblast mitochondria were prepared from human term placenta as described by Martinez et al.(19Martinez F. Kiriakidou M. Strauss III, J.F. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2172-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).

Reactions were terminated by the addition of methanol, and progesterone was assayed as described above. Progesterone present at zero time was subtracted from values obtained at various time points of incubation. Wild type CHO cells were treated with progesterone (10 μg/ml) plus LDL (100 μg/ml) to induce cholesterol accumulation in lysosomes (7Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Love D.C. Cooney A. Comly M. Neufeld E.

To assess the effect of microtubule disruption on MLN64-GFP trafficking, cells were cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing medium with 10 μmnocodazole (Sigma) for up to 2 h at 37 °C. Late endocytic compartments (late endosomes and lysosomes) were labeled by incubating cells with fluorescent dextran (5Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Neufeld E.B. Love D.C. Cooney A.D. Comly M. Patel S.

Cells were cultured at 37 °C, in medium containing 1 mg/ml rhodamine-dextran (dextran, tetramethylrhodamine, Mr 70,000, lysine-fixable; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h of uptake plus 1 h of chase (2 h of uptake/chase time), or 17 h of uptake plus 1 h of chase (18 h of uptake/chase time) before live cell imaging. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min to 1 h, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and immunostained with mouse monoclonal anti-C-terminal MLN64 antibody (10Watari H.

Confocal images were collected using an LSM410 confocal microscope system equipped with a krypton-argon Omnichrome laser with excitation wavelengths of 488 and 568 nm for GFP and rhodamine (and Alexa Fluor 568), respectively (Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY), and an argon ion laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) with an excitation wavelength of 351 nm for filipin. Emissions were collected with a C-apochromat 63 × 1.2 NA water immersion objective (Zeiss) using a 514–540-nm band pass filter for GFP, a 590-nm long pass filter for rhodamine and DsRed RFP, and a 400–435-nm band pass filter for filipin. Time lapse images were captured using a cooled CCD camera (CoolSNAP HQ Monochrome; Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), with a Sony Interline high quantum efficiency chip and custom macros provided by BioVision Technologies. The camera was attached to an Axiovert 35 inverted microscope (Zeiss) with a plan Apochromat 100 × 1.4 NA oil immersion objective (Zeiss) or a C-apochromat 63 × 1.2 NA water immersion objective (Zeiss). The excitation was from a 100-watt Hg-Arc lamp (Atto Instruments Inc., Rockville, MD) with standard fluorescein and rhodamine optics for GFP and RFP, respectively. For CFP and YFP, exciters 395–425 and 460–480 nm, dichroic 505DCXR, and emitter 505–555 nm were used. For dual color time lapse imaging of CFP/YFP or GFP/RFP in co-transfected cells, cells were imaged at 20 °C to slow late endosomal tubular movement. Either CFP and YFP or GFP and RFP were excited and collected sequentially with a time interval of 0 s to minimize time lag during switching channels. IPLab software system (Scanalytics, Fairfax, VA) and custom scripts provided by BioVision Technologies were used for image capture, processing, animation, and export to QuickTime movies. Adobe Photoshop 5.0 was also used for image processing (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). The fusion protein constructs, MLN64-GFP, START-MLN64-GFP, and ΔSTART-MLN64-GFP, used in this study are shown schematically in Fig. 1. Western blotting using anti-GFP or anti-MLN64 antibodies demonstrated that GFP is attached to MLN64 (Fig. 1, A and B), ΔSTART-MLN64 (Fig. 1C), and START-MLN64 (Fig. 1,D and E). We detected a low molecular weight band in cells transfected with MLN64-GFP with anti-GFP antibody (Fig.1B). This band was not found either in cells at early times after transfection with MLN64-GFP (15 h) when the MLN64-GFP was found mainly on the plasma membrane (see below) or in cells transfected with ΔSTART-MLN64-GFP or START-MLN64-GFP. This GFP-positive protein is probably derived from post-translational proteolysis in which GFP is cleaved from the MLN64 protein. We do not yet have an antibody recognizing the MLN64 N terminus. However, in extracts of cells transfected with ΔSTART-MLN64 the anti-GFP antibody detected a single protein of the expected molecular weight of the mutant-GFP fusion protein. Similarly, analysis of cells transfected with the START-MLN64-GFP expression plasmid revealed a single MLN64- and GFP-positive protein of the anticipated molecular weight of the fusion protein. We obtained similar results when the plasmids were introduced into either COS or CHO cells. Although MLN64 has been localized to late endosomes (12Alpy F. Stoeckel M.E. Dierich A. Escola J.M.

To study the biosynthetic pathway of MLN64, we followed the expression of MLN64-GFP in living CT60 CHO cells that have mutations in theNPC1 gene and thus display a cholesterol trafficking defect (Fig. 2). 12–17 h after transfection, we found that MLN64-GFP was mainly associated with the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A). Very little MLN64-GFP fluorescence was present in cholesterol-laden lysosomes that were labeled by rhodamine dextran uptaken by the cells for 17 h before transfection (data not shown) (7Zhang M. Dwyer N.K. Love D.C. Cooney A. Comly M. Neufeld E. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Hanover J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Filipin staining confirmed that MLN64-GFP was at the periphery of cholesterol-loaded lysosomes (data not shown). These observations confirm that MLN64-GFP travels first to the plasma membrane before being targeted to the late endocytic compartment. In wild type CHO cells, MLN64-GFP followed an identical biosynthetic pathway to the plasma membrane (data not shown) and then to the late endocytic pathway (see below), as in CT60 cells. The ΔSTART-MLN64-GFP followed a biosynthetic trafficking pathway similar to that of wild-type MLN64, first to the plasma membrane (Fig.2D) and then to the cholesterol-laden lysosomes (Fig.2E), showing that ΔSTART-MLN64-GFP contains the essential signals for plasma membrane localization and lysosomal targeting similar to newly synthesized MLN64. ΔSTART-MLN64-GFP is not recognized by the anti-C-terminal MLN64 antibody (Fig. 2F). START-MLN64-GFP, the mutant lacking the N-terminal domai"

On endothelial cells lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor 1 (LOX-1) and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), act in concert by mediating the holoparticle of and selective cholesteryl ester uptake from HOCl-HDL. We therefore investigated the ligand specificity of HOCl-HDL to SR-BI-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells. Binding of HOCl-HDL was saturable, and the degree of HOCl modification was the determining factor for increased binding affinity to SR-BI. Competition experiments further confirmed that HOCl-HDL binds with increased affinity to the same or overlapping domain(s) of SR-BI as does native HDL. Furthermore, SR-BI-mediated selective HDL-cholesteryl ester association as well as time- and concentration-dependent cholesterol efflux from SR-BI overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells were, depending on the degree of HOCl modification of HDL, markedly impaired. The most significant findings of this study were that the presence of very low concentrations of HOCl-HDL severely impaired SR-BI-mediated bidirectional cholesterol flux mediated by native HDL.

HOCl reacts with thiols and thioesters, Fe-S centers, nucleotides, with lipids, e.g. unsaturated fatty acids (FAs), to form chlorohydrins, protein-derived amine groups to form chloramines, and lipoproteins, respectively.

In vitro experiments further demonstrated that HOCl transforms native HDL into a “high uptake” form for macrophages (27Panzenboeck U. Raitmayer S. Reicher H. Lindner H. Glatter O. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29711-29720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Compared with native HDL, internalization and degradation of HOCl-HDL by macrophages were enhanced, whereas lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux, regardless of whether reagent NaOCl or myeloperoxidase-generated HOCl was used to modify the lipoprotein, was decreased (27Panzenboeck U. Raitmayer S. Reicher H. Lindner H. Glatter O. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29711-29720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Bergt C. Reicher H.

Aoyama T. Moriwaki H. Hoshikawa H. Aiba Y. Tanaka T. Miwa S. Katsura Y. Kita T. Masaki T. Nature. 1997; 386: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar) and scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI; for review, see Ref. 30Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), were identified on human umbilical endothelial cells as candidate receptors that mediate holoparticle of and selective cholesteryl ester (CE) uptake from HOCl-HDL in concert (31Marsche G. Levak-Frank S. Quehenberger O. Heller R. Sattler W. Malle E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1095-1097PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the present study was aimed at investigating the binding properties of HOCl-HDL to SR-BI in more detail. During these in vitro experiments with SR-BI-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (32Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T., Xu, S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar) we were able to demonstrate that (i) HOCl-HDL is a high affinity ligand for SR-BI; (ii) the degree of HOCl modification controls the efficiency of CE uptake from and cellular cholesterol efflux to the modified lipoprotein particles. From our in vitro findings we conclude that modification of HDL by HOCl may block SR-BI-mediated interaction with native HDL. NaOCl, organic solvents, potassium bromide, and egg yolk lecithin were obtained from Sigma. Radiochemicals were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DMEM and Ham's F12K medium were from Invitrogen, and and fetal calf serum was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Plasticware used for tissue culture was obtained from Costar. Triethylamine was purchased from Fluka. Acetone and methanol were of HPLC grade (Lactan, Graz, Austria). All other chemicals were obtained from Merck except where indicated. HDL (subclass 3, d = 1.125–1.21 g/ml) was prepared by discontinuous density ultracentrifugation of plasma obtained from normolipidemic blood donors (33Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). HDL was recovered from the tubes and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mm, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl). The protein concentration of the resulting solution was determined by the Lowry procedure (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modification of HDL with OCl− was performed as described by Panzenboeck et al. (27Panzenboeck U. Raitmayer S. Reicher H. Lindner H. Glatter O. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29711-29720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of HDL-protein/ml of PBS was incubated with NaOCl solution (a single addition and gentle vortexing) at NaOCl:HDL molar ratios of ranging from 25 (275 μm NaOCl) to 200 (2.2 mm NaOCl; 60 min, 0 °C, under argon) with the final pH adjusted to 7.4. The modified HDL preparations were passed over a PD10 column to remove unreacted NaOCl. The concentration of reagent NaOCl was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient for OCl− of 350 cm−1 at 292 nm (28Bergt C. Reicher H. Malle E. Sattler W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The modified HDL preparations were stored at 4 °C and used between 6 and 24 h after exposure to the oxidant. Aliquots of native and NaOCl-modified HDL (450 μg of protein) were lyophilized in 5-ml ampoules and purged with nitrogen before hydrolysis in constant boiling 6 n HCl (24 h, 120 °C). Amino acid analysis was performed on a Biotronics analyzer as described by Panzenboeck et al. (27Panzenboeck U. Raitmayer S. Reicher H. Lindner H. Glatter O. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29711-29720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Phospholipid (PL) analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 1050 system equipped with a Varex light-scattering detector ELSD IIA with a Vertex column (LiChrospher Diol 100, 5 μm, 250 × 2.0 mm, Knauer). The atomizer inlet air flow (60 mm) and drift tube temperature (120 °C) of the detector were maintained throughout all analyses. Separations were performed by gradient elution (flow rate, 0.8 ml/min) using solvent systems of n-hexane, methanol:acetic acid:triethylamine (765.7:15.31:12.9, v/v), and acetone:acetic acid:triethylamine (765.4:15.31:12.9, v/v) as described by Saset al. (35Sas B. Peys E. Helsen M. J. Chromatogr. 1999; 864: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Eluents were flushed continuously with helium. PLs (phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine) and the corresponding lyso-compounds used for calibration curves were extracted from wild type yeast cells grown on full medium and separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on silica gel 60 plates by using chloroform, methanol, and 25% ammonia (65:35:5, v/v) as first and chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:20:10:10: 5, v/v) as second developing solvents. Determination of PL content was performed by a standard phosphorus quantification procedure as described by Broekhuyse (36Broekhuyse R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 152: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). FA analysis of total HDL lipids was performed as described by Sattler et al. (37Sattler W. Puhl H. Hayn M. Kostner G.M. Esterbauer H. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 38Sattler W. Reicher H. Ramos P. Panzenboeck U. Hayn M. Esterbauer H. Malle E. Kostner G.M. Lipids. 1996; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The FA composition of HDL lipid subclasses was analyzed after in situ transesterification of the corresponding TLC spots. Separation of FA methyl esters was performed on a WCOT fused silica 25 m FFAP-CB column (0.32-mm inner diameter; Chrompack) using a HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a split/splitless injector (Hewlett-Packard). Cholesterol analysis (esterified and free cholesterol) of HDL lipids was performed as described by Panzenboeck et al. (27Panzenboeck U. Raitmayer S. Reicher H. Lindner H. Glatter O. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29711-29720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Iodination of HDL and HOCl-HDL was performed as described by Artl et al. (39Artl A. Marsche G. Lestavel S. Sattler W. Malle E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) using N-Br-succinimide (40Sinn H.J. Schrenk H.H. Friedrich E.A. Via D.P. Dresel H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as the coupling agent. Routinely, 1 mCi of Na125I was used to label 5 mg of HDL. This procedure resulted in specific activities between 300 and 500 dpm/ng of protein with less than 3% lipid-associated activity. No cross-linking or fragmentation of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I, the major apolipoprotein of HDL) resulting from the iodination procedure could be detected by SDS-PAGE and subsequent autoradiography. HDL and HOCl-HDL were labeled with [cholesteryl-1,2,6,7-3H]palmitate by CE transfer protein-catalyzed transfer from donor liposomes as described by Artl et al. (39Artl A. Marsche G. Lestavel S. Sattler W. Malle E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 μCi of the corresponding label and 100 μg of egg yolk lecithin were dried under argon, followed by the addition of 1 ml of PBS. The mixture was shaken for 2 min at 37 °C and sonicated. Lipoproteins (1 ml, containing 3–6 mg of protein), 1 ml of lipoprotein-deficient serum (as a source of CE transfer protein), and 1 ml of PBS were added. The mixture was incubated under argon at 37 °C in a shaking water bath overnight. Subsequently, the labeled HDL fractions were reisolated in a TLX120 bench top ultracentrifuge in a TLA100.4 rotor (Beckman). The HDL band (d = 1.125–1.21 g/ml) was aspirated and dialyzed against 10 mm PBS, pH 7.4. This labeling procedure resulted in specific activities of 5–9 cpm/ng of protein. ldlA cells (clone 7, a low density lipoprotein receptor-deficient CHO cell line) were cultured in Ham's F12K medium containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (32Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T., Xu, S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 41Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable transfectants expressing murine SR-BI (ldlA[mSR-BI]) were maintained in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. ldlA[mSR-BI] showed an approximately 50-fold higher expression of SR-BI protein (estimated by immunoblotting experiments, data not shown) compared with ldlA7. Both cell lines were kindly provided by Dr. Monty Krieger, MIT. Association studies of HDL and HOCl-HDL to CHO cells were performed at 37 °C with increasing amounts of 125I- and/or [3H]CE-labeled lipoproteins in the absence (total association) or presence of 1 mg of protein/ml (unspecific association) of unlabeled autologous lipoprotein (42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Labeled lipoprotein particles were added to a final concentration up to 500 μg of protein/ml, and cells were incubated in DMEM without fetal calf serum at 37 °C up to 2 h. After this incubation the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rinsed twice with Tris-buffered saline (containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) followed by two washes with Tris-buffered saline. Cells were lysed with 0.3 n NaOH. The radioactivity and protein content of the cell lysate were measured in the same aliquot. Protein was measured according to Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific association was calculated as the difference between the total and nonspecific association (42Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Degradation of 125I-labeled HDL particles by CHO cells was estimated by measuring the non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the medium after precipitation of free iodine with AgNO3 (43Jessup W. Mander E.L. Dean R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ml of medium was removed, mixed with 100 μl of bovine serum albumin (30 mg/ml), and 1 ml of trichloroacetic acid (3 m, 4 °C) and left at 4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, 250 μl of an AgNO3 solution (0.7m) was added and mixed. Then the samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C for 15 min. The radioactivity of the supernatant was determined using a γ-counter (125I). Specific degradation was calculated as the difference between total and nonspecific degradation (39Artl A. Marsche G. Lestavel S. Sattler W. Malle E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The specificity of the lipoprotein binding sites was examined by competition experiments. Association of 10 μg of125I-labeled HDL/ml or 100 μg of [3H]CE-labeled HDL/ml were competed for by 0–100 μg of protein/ml of unlabeled HDL and HOCl-HDL (oxidant:lipoprotein molar ratio of 50:1 and 200:1). Efflux of 3H-labeled cholesterol from CHO cells was measured by appearance of [3H]cholesterol in the cellular supernatant. The cells were incubated in the presence of 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol for 48 h. After cholesterol loading of the cells, the monolayer were rinsed twice with Tris-buffered saline (containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) and twice with Tris-buffered saline (39Artl A. Marsche G. Lestavel S. Sattler W. Malle E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 763-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Efflux experiments were initiated by the addition of HDL, HOCl-HDL, or apoA-I in DMEM without fetal calf serum. At the indicated time points (up to 4 h) the medium was collected and counted on a β-counter. Afterwards, the cells were lysed in 0.3n NaOH to estimate the cellular protein content and the cell-associated radioactivity. Efflux of radioactive label into the medium was calculated as the percentage of radioactivity associated with cells before the addition of the indicated cholesterol acceptors. Both HDL-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux and CE association by ldlA[mSR-BI] cells were studied in the presence of increasing amounts of KKB-1, a polyclonal rabbit anti-mSR-BI antiserum, reported to block both CE association and cellular cholesterol efflux (43Jessup W. Mander E.L. Dean R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Aortas and aorta abdominalis of three autopsy cases with different histological classification of atherosclerosis (lesion types III and IV according to Ref. 45Stary H.C. Chandler A.B. Dinsmore R.E. Fuster V. Glagov S. Insull Jr., W. Rosenfeld M.E. Schwartz C.J. Wagner W.D. Wissler R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1512-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar) who died of cerebral hemorrhage were used. The morphology of the aortas investigated ranged from microscopically normal morphology to thickened intima up to pronounced atheroma containing calcium inclusion. The autopsy material was taken 12 h after death. Immunohistochemistry was carried out on tissues embedded in tissue freezing medium (Tissue Tec OCT compound, Mileds, Elkhard, IN). Serial cryosections (5 μm, Microm, Walldorf, Germany, Microm HM 500 OM) were collected on glass slides, air dried for 2 h at 25 °C, fixed in acetone for 5 min at 25 °C, and stored at −70 °C until required. Lipids were stained with Oil Red O. After staining the nuclei with hemalum, sections were mounted with Kaiser's glycerin gelatin. Pictures were taken on an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) by using the digital camera AxioCam HRc (Zeiss). For double immunofluorescence the sections were thawed, fixed once more in acetone at 25 °C (5 min), and rehydrated in PBS (25Hammer A. Desoye G. Dohr G. Sattler W. Malle E. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After blocking (10 min with human AB serum, diluted 1:10 in blocking solution, Dako, Vienna), the sections were incubated with monoclonal antibody 2D10G9 (dilution 1:10, specifically recognizing HOCl-modified epitopes; Ref. 46Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) for 30 min at 25 °C, followed by an incubation step with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (LSAB kit, Dako) for 15 min and cyanine (Cy)-3 labeled streptavidin (Amersham Biosciences, dilution 1:300). Afterwards the sections were blocked with rabbit nonimmune serum (dilution 1:300, Dako) and incubated (30 min) with rabbit anti-human apoA-I antiserum (dilution 1:1,000, Behring) followed by an incubation with Cy-2-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:300, Jackson Dianova). PBS was used for washing sections between different incubation steps. Sections were mounted with Moviol (Calbiochem-Novabiochem) and analyzed on a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS NT, Leica Lasertechnik GmbH, Heidelberg) equipped with an argon-krypton laser (25Hammer A. Desoye G. Dohr G. Sattler W. Malle E. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Signals were detected with a double dichroitic beam splitter (488/568 nm), using a 580 nm short pass and a 530 nm band pass filter for Cy-2 and a 590 nm long pass filter for Cy-3. Control experiments encompassed immunofluorescence (i) without primary detection antibodies, (ii) with monoclonal or polyclonal nonimmune antibodies as primary antibodies, and (iii) without secondary antibodies. SDS-PAGE and subsequent silver staining of apolipoproteins revealed that an increasing oxidant:HDL molar ratio resulted in a gradual loss of monomeric, 28-kDa apoA-I (Fig.1), with the concomitant formation of high molecular mass aggregates even at low HOCl concentrations (25:1). To identify preferential amino acid targets, the amino acid composition of HOCl-HDL was analyzed. From the data shown in Table I, it is evident that Cys and Met were completely consumed at a molar HOCl:HDL ratio of 50:1, whereas His, Arg, and Lys were consumed in a dose-dependent fashion up to 20–50% at the highest HOCl concentration used (Table I). As a consequence, the relative electrophoretic mobility (46Malle E. Hazell L. Stocker R. Sattler W. Esterbauer H. Waeg G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 982-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) of the modified lipoprotein particles in agarose gel electrophoresis increased.Table ICharacterization of native and HOCl-modified HDLCysMetTyrLysHisArgREMPCTCFC%%%HDL1.14.523.643.47.027.11100100100HOCl-HDL (mol:mol)25:10.52.521.141.67.026.61.0598.8 ± 199.4 ± 2100 ± 250:10019.338.06.926.61.2395.8 ± 299.3 ± 1.7101 ± 1.7100:10018.829.36.426.71.5795.0 ± 194.8 ± 2.5104 ± 2.5200:10011.125.85.123.71.7992.4 ± 290.7 ± 3107 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Characterization of the lipid moiety of native HDL revealed that PC is the major PL species accounting up to 90% of total PLs, whereas the remaining PL species are composed of phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively. Modification of HDL by increasing the HOCl concentrations led to a slight decrease of PC (Table I), whereas in parallel only trace amounts of lyso-PC were formed (up to 1.2% of total PC at the highest HOCl concentration used, 200:1). The amount of the minor PL species was not altered significantly during the HOCl treatment (data not shown). In line with our previous findings (27Panzenboeck U. Raitmayer S. Reicher H. Lindner H. Glatter O. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29711-29720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) the amount of unsaturated FAs (primarily C18:1 and C18:2) in HDL subclasses (PL and CE fraction) was decreased slightly (approximately 10%) at the highest HOCl concentration (200:1) used. In parallel, the amount of free FAs remained widely unaltered at the highest HOCl concentration used (data not shown). Further characterization of the lipid moiety revealed that an increasing NaOCl concentration was paralleled by a marginal increase of the unesterified cholesterol content. Under the experimental conditions described in Table I and Fig. 1, no formation of lipid peroxidation products (measured as thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) could be detected. To investigate binding properties of lipoproteins to ldlA[mSR-BI] and ldlA7 cells at 37 °C, the protein moiety of the lipoproteins was labeled with Na125I. Binding capacity (Bmax values) of 125I-HDL and 125I-HOCl-HDL to ldlA[mSR-BI] cells was about 12–40-fold higher compared with ldlA7 cells (data not shown), indicating that SR-BI mediates binding of HDL and HOCl-HDL, respectively (Fig. 2A). Nonlinear regression analysis showed a marked increase in binding affinity (Kd values, Table II) for HOCl-HDL with increasing degree of HOCl modification but decreased Bmax values. Time-dependent association studies (Fig. 2B) revealed that 125I-HOCl-HDL associates much faster with SR-BI compared with native HDL (Table II).Table IICalculation of Kd, Bmax, and t1/2 values by nonlinear regression analysisKdBmaxt1/22-aTime necessary to reach half-maximal cell association.μg/mlng/mgminHDL15.2 ± 1.4596 ± 2531 ± 7HOCl-HDL50:15.7 ± 0.3459 ± 129.3 ± 0.7200:11.2 ± 0.2312 ± 202.9 ± 0.342-a Time necessary to reach half-maximal cell as"
https://openalex.org/W2002331964,"The cytoplasmic region of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) contains an intrinsic tyrosine kinase (697–955) followed by a 231-residue-long COOH-terminal tail (C-tail), which contains multiple tyrosine residues. To examine the role of the EGFR C-tail in signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation, a series of EGFR C-tail truncations were constructed. Transient transfection of 293 cells with EGFR lacking the C-tail, i.e. Y974ΔEGFR or Y992ΔEGFR, led to EGF-independent or constitutive STAT activation, whereas EGF-dependent STAT activation was restored with truncations made COOH-terminal to the next tyrosine residue, i.e.EGFR-Y1045Δ. Transfection with the-truncated form EGFR-Y954Δ resulted in the loss of STAT activation, suggesting that the sequence between Tyr974 and Tyr954 is essential for STAT activation. Phosphopeptide competition analysis revealed multiple tyrosine residues within the C-tail that can act as the docking sites for both Stat1 and Stat3. A region that negatively regulated STAT activation was also identified, extending from Tyr1114 to Glu1172, consistent with the ability of this region to recruit a suppressor of cytokine signaling factors SOCS1 and SOCS3. When cotransfected with the full-length EGFR, but not Y992ΔEGFR, SOCS1 or SOCS3 inhibited STAT activation by EGF in 293 cells. This suggests that both SOCS1 and SOCS3 can negatively regulate EGFR activation, presumably by inducing ubiquitination-dependent EGFR degradation upon ligand binding. These findings may therefore offer clues to how the EGF receptor C-tail regulates STAT activity.

However, EGF also inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in some cancer cell lines with aberrant expression of EGF receptor (EGFR) (1Armstrong D.K. Kaufmann S.H. Ottaviano Y.L. Furuya Y.

Binding of EGF to the 170-kDa EGFR initiates a program of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity resulting in autophosphorylation of the receptor and phosphorylation of a number of SH2 domain-containing signaling proteins, including STAT. Within the EGFR cytoplasmic domain (654–1210), the tyrosine kinase motif extends from amino acid 697 to 955 followed by a 255-amino acid distal COOH-terminal domain (C-tail). Among the C-tail tyrosine residues, Tyr992, Tyr1068, Tyr1086, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173 were demonstrated previously as autophosphorylation sites (3Chattopadhyay A. Vecchi M., Ji, Q.S. Mernaugh R. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26091-26097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, it is generally believed that these five individual EGFR autophosphorylation sites do not stringently define all possible association motifs of SH2-containing proteins (4Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 77009-77012Google Scholar). Among all of the C-tail tyrosine residues, there are three YXXL/V, two YXNQ, four YXXP/D, and five N/D/VPXY sequences, with some overlap. For many transmembrane receptors, YXXL/I/V and YXXP/D motifs within their cytoplasmic domains serve as the docking sites for the SH2 domain-containing proteins. ZAP-70, SHP-2, and Stat5 all have been found to recognize these sequences (5Gauen L.K. Zhu Y. Letourneur F., Hu, Q. Bolen J.B. Matis L.A. Klausner R.D. Shaw A.S. Mol. Cell.

Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar), whereas proteins containing phosphor-tyrosine binding domains can recognize an N/D/VPXY motif (9Gustafson T.A., He, W. Craparo A. Schaub C.D. O'Neill T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 5: 2500-2508Crossref Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The features of the sequences flanking the tyrosine residues within the C-tail suggest that the EGFR may contain more than five autophosphorylation tyrosine residues that have not been recognized previously. The diversity of potential phosphor-tyrosine motifs within the EGFR C-tail may be the reason why this receptor is able to recruit and activate many different signaling proteins. STAT (i.e. Stat1, 3, and 5) activation by EGF was detected in mouse liver and in some cancer cell lines such as A431 and MD-MBA-468 cells that overexpress EGFR (10Fu X.Y. Zhang J.J.

Although EGFR expression level was hypothesized to be critical for STAT activation, Stat1 activation by EGF was not detected in a number of cancer cell lines with abnormal EGFR expression (14Bromberg J.F.

Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). An EGFR-associated inhibitory factor was thus proposed to block EGF-mediated Stat1 activation (17Iwamoto Y. Chin Y.E. Peng X. Fu X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18198-18204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). For those cytokine receptors lacking intrinsic kinase activity, removal or mutation of the C-tail tyrosine residues does impair the ability of the receptor to recruit and activate STAT, even though JAK association is unaffected (8Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). The involvement of the EGFR C-tail and its tyrosine residues in STAT binding and activation are controversial (18David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9185-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Because of the number and redundancy of tyrosine sites in EGFR, determining which sites mediate relevant biological responses is difficult. To investigate EGFR-mediated STAT activation, EGFR with Tyr → Phe C-tail point mutations of all known autophosphorylation sites and EGFR mutants with progressively-truncated C-tails were constructed and tested for their ability to activate STAT. Moreover, tyrosine phosphopeptides representing the EGFR C-tail tyrosine residue motifs were synthesized and analyzed for interaction with STAT. Together these data revealed multiple docking sites for both Stat1 and Stat3 within the EGFR C-tail as well as a negative regulatory region for STAT activation. The observation that SOCS1 and SOCS3 were found to interact with EGFR C-tail, together with the knowledge that STAT activation is sensitive to EGFR expression levels, suggests that SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibit STAT activation, presumably because of their induction of ubiquitination-dependent EGFR proteolytic degradation. Recombinant human EGF was purchased from Invitrogen and IFN-γ was purchased from Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal anti-EGFR (extracellular domain) antibody was from Sigma. Anti-Stat1 (COOH-terminal region) and anti-pY20 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Stat1 NH2-terminal region antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Both anti-phosphoStat1 (pY701) and anti-phosphoStat3 (pY705) were provided by NEB. Wild type Stat1 cDNA was constructed into pSG5 expression vector as described previously (20Fu X.Y. Cell. 1992; 70: 323-335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The DNA binding domain (DBD)-mutated Stat1 was created by converting Glu428Glu429 → Ala428Ala429 (pSG5-Stat1-E428E429/AA). Stat1 with a deletion mutation from Ser316 to Ser606(Stat1-LSΔ) was constructed using SacI digestion. The linker domain (residues Thr489–Gly576) and the αA-βB (Lys584–Phe603) motif of the SH2 domain were deleted in this Stat1-LSΔ construct. The expression construct of full-length human EGFR in pCDNA3 was supplied by G. Gill. EGFR C-tail tyrosine point mutations (Tyr → Phe) were constructed by the QuikChange PCR amplification method using appropriately designed oligonucleotide primers (Stratagene). The C-tail-truncated EGFRs were constructed using the method of Caoet al. (21Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All EGFR mutant constructs were confirmed by sequencing. c-Myc-tagged SOCS factors in pCDNA3 were provided by A. Yoshimura. Both GST-SOCS and His-STAT constructs were prepared as described in our previous publication (22Wang Y., Wu, T.R. Cai S. Welte T. Chin Y.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4505-4512Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All of the peptides were synthesized as amides on a multiple peptide synthesizer according to the standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) machine protocol (Abimed AMS 422, Langenfeld, Germany). Amino acid composition was verified, and molarity was calculated using a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer. All of the products were purified with high performance liquid chromatography to purity >80%. Fractions of cell membrane and cytosolic proteins were prepared from A431 cells for in vitro EGFR kinase assay as described previously (17Iwamoto Y. Chin Y.E. Peng X. Fu X.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18198-18204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Nature. 1993; 362: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent A431 cells were pelted and lysed in 20 mmHepes buffer pH 7.9 containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin. The resulting sample was saved as a cytosolic fraction. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was saved as the membrane fraction. Cell-free activation of STAT reaction (15 μl) contained 1 μl of membrane and 2 μl of cytosolic fractions. The reactions were incubated for 15 min on ice in the absence or presence of 2 μg/ml EGF. Buffer containing ATP was added, and the reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Reactions were stopped by incubation on ice with 1 mm EDTA and brief centrifugation. Aliquots were incubated with peptides at the indicated concentrations before being subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis. For STAT-DNA binding activity analysis, M67SIE was used as a probe, and the procedure for EMSA was described in detail previously (14Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). For affinity precipitation and Western blotting assay, Ni2+ resin was used to conjugate His6-tagged proteins (Novagen). Whole cell extracts were incubated for a period of at least 4 h with either agarose beads, conjugated antibodies, or GST-SOCS proteins or resin-conjugated His-STAT proteins. After incubation, the beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and suspended in 2× loading butter. The affinity precipitates or cell extracts were electrophoresized on a SDS polyacrylamide gel (10%), transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and followed by immunoblotting analysis with appropriate antibodies (15Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). For the luciferase activity assay, 2xM67SIE-luciferase reporter was cotransfected with EGFR into 293 or NIH3T3 cells using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's procedure (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection the cells were treated with or without EGF for an additional 6 h. In 293 cells, Stat1 activation by EGF was detected only when EGFR was transfected (Fig.1, A and B), whereas MAP kinase activation by EGF was detected regardless of EGFR transfection (Fig. 1B). Although Stat3 DNA binding activity (homodimer) was barely detected under the conditions used, both Stat1 and Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylations were detected (Fig. 1, Aand B). These results suggest that EGFR expression is crucial for STAT but not for MAP kinase ligand-induced activation. To find which motif(s) within the C-tail is/are critical for STAT activation, a series of EGFR with progressive carboxyl terminus deletions were constructed. Truncations were designed so that each successive deletion resulted in the loss of one further tyrosine residue as illustrated in Fig.2A. In Fig. 2B, EGF-dependent Stat1 DNA binding activity was clearly detected in 293 cells expressing EGFR-Y1173Δ, a truncation missing the most COOH-terminal 14 residues of EGFR. Deletions resulting in the loss of the next two tyrosine residues, i.e.Tyr1148 (EGFR-Y1148Δ) and Tyr1114(EGFR-Y1114Δ), resulted in a greatly reduced STAT activation response to EGF. However, STAT activation by EGF was restored when EGFR truncation was extended one tyrosine residue farther, i.e.Tyr1101 (EGFR-Y1101Δ). This result strengthened the observation made by other workers in that the EGFR C-tail may contain a negative regulatory domain (18David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9185-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like Tyr1173 and Tyr1148, the tyrosine residues Tyr1086 and Tyr1068 are previously confirmed autophosphorylatable sites. Truncated EGFRs, i.e. EGFR-Y1086Δ, EGFR-Y1068Δ, and EGFR-Y1045Δ, were able to mediate EGF-induced STAT activation. Surprisingly, the C-tail truncations of the next two tyrosine residues (Tyr992, the last confirmed autophosphorylation residue, and Tyr974) led to constitutive activation of STAT in 293 cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, the maximal C-tail region that is essential for STAT activation extends from Tyr954 to Arg973, whereas residues Tyr992 to the carboxyl terminus Ala1186 appear to be inessential for STAT activation but critical for EGF-mediated regulation of STAT activation. Comparable expression levels of truncated EGFRs in 293 cells are shown in Fig. 2C. A similar pattern of Stat1 constitutive activation by EGFR-Y992Δ and EGFR-Y974Δ was also observed in COS-7 cells (Fig. 2D, top panel). The bottom panel in Fig.2D shows the even expression level of these EGFR mutants. In NIH3T3 cells, however, a basal level of constitutive Stat3 DNA binding activity was observed, which was enhanced by transient transfection with wild type EGFR (Fig. 2E). Both EGFR-Y992Δ and EGFR-Y974Δ were apparently more efficient than wild type EGFR in Stat3 formation and subsequent DNA binding activity as detected by EMSA (Fig. 2E). Both EGFR-Y992Δ and -Y974Δ truncations induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in NIH3T3 cells, regardless of EGF treatment (Fig. 2F). Consistently, both EGFR-Y992Δ and EGFR-Y974Δ apparently induced Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation in NIH3T3 cells, regardless of EGF treatment (Fig. 2F). Because comparable protein levels of Stat1 and Stat3 were detected in these cell lines (data not shown), the specificity of STAT activation is unlikely to be determined by the level of EGFR or STAT in these cells but rather by another cellular activity. Activation of Stat1 and Stat3 can have opposite implications for cell survival and growth (14Bromberg J.F. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Devgan G. Zhao Y. Pestell R.G. Albanese C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1999; 98: 295-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar, 15Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell.

Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). As expected, transient transfection with wild type EGFR or EGFR-Y992Δ in 293 cells led to apparent cell death after serum starvation for 36 h (Fig. 2G). In contrast, NIH3T3 cells transiently transfected with either wild type EGFR or EGFR-Y992Δ became resistant to induction apoptosis by serum starvation (Fig. 2G). Together these findings indicate that although the EGFR C-tail is not critical for STAT activation by EGFR it plays an important role in the regulation of STAT, including the prevention of constitutive STAT activation. To further identify the tyrosine module(s) corresponding to STAT docking and activation, we mutated the five previously demonstrated autophosphorylation residues (Tyr992, Tyr1068, Tyr1086, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173) either individually or in tandem. As shown in Fig. 3A, STAT activation by EGF was not impaired by any single or double mutation of these sites, in agreement with a previous observation (18David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9185-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, these results indicated that either these autophosphorylatable tyrosine sites are not relevant to STAT activation as suggested by David et al. (18David M. Wong L. Flavell R. Thompson S.A. Wells A. Larner A.C. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9185-9188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) or redundant tyrosine residues are involved in STAT activation as proposed by Silvennoinenet al. (19Silvennoinen O. Schindler C. Schlessinger J. Levy D.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1736-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). To distinguish these two possibilities peptides of 13 amino acids, each containing one of the tyrosine residues of the EGFR C-tail in non-phosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, were synthesized (Fig.3B). The approach of using synthesized peptides in a competition assay has been successfully used to identify sequences of different cytokine receptors important in STAT activation (25Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 26Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J., Ho, T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). In cell-free assays, fractions of A431 cell membrane and cytosome were incubated with EGF. Different concentrations of synthesized peptides were subsequently added into the reactions before incubating with32P-labeled M67SIE probe. The EMSA results shown in Fig.3C indicate that among all of the phosphopeptides tested, phosphopeptide pY1148, containing a NPDYQQD motif, abolished Stat1 binding to DNA without affecting Stat3-DNA complex formation. This suggests that Stat1 may preferentially interact with Tyr1148 within the EGFR C-tail. Phospho-Tyr1045(LQRYSSD) and pY992 (ADEYLIP) peptides inhibited both Stat1 and Stat3 DNA binding markedly, indicating that residues Tyr1045 and Tyr992 might be involved in the recruitment of both Stat1 and Stat3 to EGFR. To a much lesser extent, pY1173 peptide inhibited Stat1 DNA binding activity. Phospho-Tyr1086 (pY1086) and pY1068 peptides blocked Stat3-DNA complex formation without any effect on Stat1-DNA interaction (Fig. 3C). Thus, Stat3 but not Stat1 preferentially interacts with both Tyr1086 and Tyr1068residues, which are both tyrosine residues found within a YXXQ motif. The experimental concentration of peptides (300 μm) required for competition was relatively high. Decreasing concentrations of these peptides (150 and 75 μm) were tested to determine the relative affinity of each peptide. Tyr1148, Tyr1086, and Tyr1068 showed much weaker effects at a concentration of 150 μm. At high concentrations (300 μm), unphosphorylated peptides showed no competition (data not shown). These data further support the notion that both Stat1 and Stat3 interact with the EGFR C-tail at multiple tyrosine residues and that C-tail docking is important for regulation of EGF-induced STAT activation. The striking effect of pY1045 peptide on STAT-DNA complex formation suggests that Tyr1045 is a potentially phosphorylatable tyrosine residue. The relatively high dose of phosphopeptides used in the above competition assay suggests that EGFR may interact with STAT not only within its SH2 domain but also within other domains. To delineate the regions in Stat1 that interact with EGFR, His6 fusion proteins of different regions of Stat1 were constructed (Fig.4A). Bead-conjugated His6 fusion proteins were incubated with whole extracts of EGF-treated A431 cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, in addition to the full-length Stat1 both the His6-SH2 domain and the His6-DBD pulled down EGFR. His6 fusion proteins were detected in a Western blot with anti-His antibody (Fig.4C). These results indicate that EGFR interacts with STAT via both the SH2 and the DNA binding domains. In 293 cells, EGFR was cotransfected along with wild type Stat1, a Stat1 DBD mutant (Glu428-Glu429 → Ala-Ala (Stat1-EA)) (27Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), the SH2 domain Arg602 → Gln Stat1 mutant (Stat1-RQ), and the linker-SH2 domain Stat1 truncation (Stat1-LSΔ). Stat1-RQ but not Stat1-EA was recovered by anti-EGFR immunoprecipitation, indicating a tighter binding between the DBD and EGFR than that between the SH2 domain and EGFR (Fig. 4D). Consistently, COOH-terminal linker/SH2 domain-truncated Stat1 was also recovered from EGFR immunoprecipitates. As expected, endogenous Stat1 was also pulled down by anti-Stat1 in all samples. These data further support the hypothesis that both the SH2 and DNA binding domains of STAT1 are involved in the interaction with EGFR. We next wanted to answer the question of how the EGFR C-tail terminates or inhibits STAT activation. SOCS is a family of small SH2-containing signaling factors turned on by STAT and engaged in the negative feedback control of JAK (28Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K.

Zhang J.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 1135-1145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar,15Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Both SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins were detected prior to treatment, but their levels were greatly elevated 2 h after the addition of EGF (Fig. 5A). Conversely, STAT activation by EGF in HeLa cells has been barely detectable (16Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M., Su, W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), and SOCS1 and SOCS3 protein levels were not markedly affected by EGF treatment (Fig. 5A). When cotransfected with EGFR, both SOCS1 and SOCS3 were recovered from the immune complex precipitated by anti-EGFR in 293 cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that EGFR can recruit these SOCS factors. This potential interaction between EGFR C-tail and SOCS1 or SOCS3 was confirmed by the ability of GST-SOCS1 and GST-SOCS3 to pull down full-length EGFR but not EGFR-Y992Δ (Fig.5C, top panel). Both GST-SOCS1 and GST-SOCS3 were able to pull down EGFR-Y1114Δ and EGFR-Y1148Δ but not EGFR-1101Δ, suggesting that SOCS proteins may bind within the 13 residues found between Tyr1101 and Tyr1114 of EGFR. This finding is in agreement with the observation of an inhibitory domain of STAT activation within this same region of the C-tail (Fig.2B). Bacterial-prepared GST fusion proteins used in these pull-down experiments are shown in Fig. 5D. Overexpression of SOCS proteins has been reported to cause tyrosine kinase JAK proteolytic degradation (31Kamizono S. Hanada T. Yasukawa H. Minoguchi S. Kato R. Minoguchi M. Hattori K. Hatakeyama S.

Junttila I. Hilton D.J. Silvennoinen O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3316-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the possible effect of SOCS1 and SOCS3 on EGFR degradation. 293 cells were cotransfected with EGFR, ubiquitin, and SOCS1 or SOCS3 and were treated with EGF for 6 h. The level of EGFR was greatly reduced in the cells cotransfected with either SOCS1 or SOCS3 (Fig.6A). In the presence of lactacystin, the proteosome-specific inhibitor, EGFR degradation was reduced, indicating that SOCS-induced EGFR degradation is a proteosome-mediated process (Fig. 6A). EGF-mediated Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly reduced in 293 cells when wild type EGFR was cotransfected with SOCS1 or SOCS3 (Fig. 6B). Stat3 phosphorylation status was affected to a lesser extend by these SOCS factors (Fig. 6B). However, Stat1 constitutive activation induced by C-tail-truncated EGFR (EGFR-Y992Δ) was not affected by the cotransfection with either SOCS1 or SOCS3 (Fig.6C). These data suggest that the interaction between these SOCS proteins and the EGFR C-tail is crucial for the SOCS factors to inhibit STAT activation by EGFR. To test the effect of SOCS1 and SOCS3 on STAT-mediated gene activation, we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Cotransfection of EGFR with either SOCS1 or SOCS3 resulted in a 4–5-fold inhibition of STAT-mediated induction of luciferase expression in response to EGF stimulation (Fig. 6D). Together these results indicate that SOCS1 and SOCS3 may attenuate STAT-mediated gene regulation presumably via a reduction in the cellular level of EGFR, which in turn reduces or shuts down STAT activation. For non-receptor tyrosine kinases such as Src and JAK, the amino-terminal SH2 domains are responsible for interacting with pTyr substrates and regulating the activity of the COOH-terminal kinase domain. Similarly, transmembrane receptor kinases such as EGFR may use the pTyr-rich C-tail to recruit SH2-containing substrates and regulate the intrinsic tyrosine kinase. In this work, through progressive truncation analysis we have demonstrated that a 20-amino acid sequence from Tyr954 to Arg973 of the EGFR C-tail is critical for the activity of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase of EGFR in STAT activation. The next immediate 17 amino acids from Tyr974 to Glu991 seem neither important for STAT activation nor related to STAT regulation because both EGFR-Y954Δ and EGFR-Y992Δ induced constitutive STAT activation. Although multiple tyrosine residues from Tyr992 to Ala1186 of the EGFR C-tail may serve as the binding sites for STAT proteins, the entire length of the C-tail is not necessarily involved in STAT activation. Instead, the C-tail appears to play an important regulatory role in STAT ligand-dependent activation. Five tyrosine residues within EGFR C-tail (Tyr992, Tyr1068, Tyr1086, Tyr1148, and Tyr1173) have been previously considered as autophosphorylation sites. Our phosphopeptide competition data indicate that additional autophosphorylation tyrosine residues may exist in the C-tail. The fact that the phosphopeptide Tyr1145residue removed both Stat1 and Stat3 from STAT-DNA complex suggests that this residue within EGFR may be such a candidate to serve as a STAT-docking site. To various levels, phosphopeptides representing Tyr1148, Tyr1045, and Tyr992 all removed Stat1 from STAT-DNA complexes in EMSA. Phosphopeptides representing Tyr1086 and Tyr1068 residues removed Stat3 from the STAT-DNA complexes. Both Tyr1068 and Tyr1086 contain the YXXQ sequence, which agrees with the notion that YXXQ is a Stat3-preferential binding sequence in gp130 (8Stahl N. Farruggella T.J. Boulton T.G. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). However, YXXQ may not be the unique module for Stat3 docking; for instance, Src lacks a YXXQ module but still recruits Stat3 for activation (21Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Our peptide competition assay suggests that Tyr992, Tyr1045, and Tyr1173 are also potential docking sites for Stat3, although YXXQ is not presented. These results are consistent with the findings that transmembrane receptors often contain redundant tyrosine residues with which an SH2 domain protein interacts (33Gerhartz C. Heesel B. Sasse J. Hemmann U. Landgraf C. Schneider-Mergener J. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12991-12998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Greenlund et al. (25Greenlund A.C. Farrar M.A. Viviano B.L. Schreiber R.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1591-1600Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) showed that a phosphopeptide mimicking a Stat1 interaction site present in the IFN-γ receptor could completely inhibit Stat1 activation at concentrations as low as 83 μm. The concentration of our peptides derived from the EGFR was required to be 3–4-fold higher in order to disrupt STAT-DNA complex formation as observed by EMSA. The STAT SH2 domain may therefore have a lower affinity for the tyrosine residues of the EGFR C-tail than those of IFN-γ receptor, or indeed STAT proteins may adopt different binding modes at different receptors. Importantly, STAT1 carrying a mutation critical to the SH2 domain, Arg602Gln, can still bind to EGFR. This is consistent with a recent report that inactivation of the Stat5a SH2 domain did not disrupt association with EGFR (34Olayioye M.A. Beuvink I. Horsch K. Daly J.M. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17209-17218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The unexpected finding that Stat1 carrying a DNA binding domain mutation loses the ability to interact with EGFR supports the notion that this domain may be important not only for the STAT-DNA interaction but also for the STAT-EGFR interaction. Therefore, STAT and EGFR interaction occurs within multiple domains. The negative domain (Tyr1101–Glu1172) within the C-tail for STAT activation contains two tyrosine residues, Tyr114 and Tyr1148. Previously it was reported that c-Cbl associated with EGFR prior to recruitment into clathrin-coated pits and remained associated throughout the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway (35de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, our data show here that by binding to the negative domain within the C-tail, SOCS proteins might stimulate the proteasomal degradation of the EGFR complex by recruiting the ubiquitin ligase machinery through its SOCS box. Because Stat1 activation by EGF was extremely sensitive to the EGFR expression level in the cell, reduced EGFR protein level may consequently affect STAT activation without influencing MAP kinase pathways. STAT has been shown previously to be ubiquitinated prior to degradation (36Kim T.K. Maniatis T. Science. 1996; 273: 1717-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and although our work demonstrates EGFR degradation as a result of SOCS1/3 overexpression, we do not exclude the possibility that SOCS may directly influence the STAT ubiquitination process. Hence, it is also possible that by binding to the putative inhibitory domain identified between Tyr1101 and Tyr1114 within the C-tail, SOCS proteins may either induce degradation of EGFR-associated STAT or block EGFR from further recruitment and activation of STAT proteins. Stat1 activation often leads to cell growth arrest and/or apoptosis (15Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Fu X.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5328-5337Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 16Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M., Su, W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). It may be important for EGFR to recruit Stat1 in order to balance or restrict Stat3 and/or other proliferative or survival signaling pathways by the same receptor that may potentially lead to transformation (16Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M., Su, W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 37Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T.

Clarke A.R. Watson C.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2604-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). STAT activation by EGF was undetectable in many cancer cell lines even with EGFR overexpression. SOCS1 and SOCS3 may therefore function as such factors in cellular inhibition of growth factor receptors that carry intrinsic tyrosine kinases in distinct cancer cell lineage (15Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M.

They differ from conventional B (B-2) cells with respect to their phenotype and mitogenic responses and are often secretors of the natural polyreactive antibodies in the serum. The origin of B-1 cells remains controversial, and the relationship between B-1 cells and autoreactive B cells is unclear. Here, we compare the signaling pathways that are activated by the engagement of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) in B-1 and B-2 cells. Stimulation of the BCR leads to the induced activation of the three major classes of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, as well as the Akt kinase and the transcription factors nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) and NF-κB in B-2 cells. In contrast, B-1 cells have constitutive activation of ERK and NF-AT but exhibit delayed JNK and lack p38 MAPK and NF-κB induction upon BCR cross-linking. The lack of NF-κB activation in B-1 cells may be due to a lack of Akt activation in these cells. Furthermore, our study using specific inhibitors reveals that the extended survival of B-1 cells in culture is not due to the constitutive activation of ERK; nor is it due to Akt signaling or Bcl-xL up-regulation, since these are not induced in B-1 cells. The current findings of altered MAPK and NF-AT activation and lack of NF-κB induction in B-1 cells indicate that these cells have signaling properties similar to tolerant B cells that are chronically exposed to self-antigens. Indeed, BCR stimulation of B-1 cells does not lead to their full activation as indicated by their lack of maximal up-regulation of specific markers such as CD25, CD69, and CD86.

Adv. Immunol. 1989; 47: 117-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). For example, B-1 cells are found in the pleural and peritoneal cavities and express a high level of IgM and low levels of IgD and the pan B-cell marker B220 on their cell surfaces. In addition, they express an intermediate level of the T-cell marker CD5. On the other hand, B-2 cells predominate in the spleen and lymph nodes and express intermediate levels of IgM and IgD and a high level of B220, and they lack CD5 expression on their cell surfaces. The origin of B-1 cells is controversial, and it remains to be determined whether they are derived from a separate B cell lineage (2Herzenberg L.A. Kantor A.B. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14 (88–90): 79-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or represent a state of differentiation or activation of normal B lymphocytes (3Haughton G. Arnold L.W. Whitmore A.C. Clarke S.H. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 84-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, B-1 cells are known to secrete natural polyreactive antibodies found in the serum and often have specificities directed toward self-antigens such as phosphatidylcholine (4Mercolino T.J. Arnold L.W. Hawkins L.A. Haughton G. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), single-stranded DNA (5Casali P. Burastero S.E. Nakamura M. Inghirami G. Notkins A.L.

Science. 1999; 285: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In addition, B-1 cells frequently give rise to B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL).1 B-1 cells also differ from B-2 cells in their functional responses to external stimuli. For example, engagement of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) leads to the proliferation of B-2 cells, but such entry into the cell cycle is blocked in B-1 cells (8Rothstein T.L. Kolber D.L. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 4089-4093PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rothstein T.L. Kolber D.L. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 2880-2885PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in physiological response suggests that B-1 cells may have signaling properties that are different from B-2 cells.The BCRs on both B-1 and B-2 cells are composed similarly of the Ig heavy and light chains in complex with the signaling subunits Igα and Igβ (10Reth M. Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). BCR signaling is known to activate numerous signal transduction pathways, and the induction of a particular pathway may depend on the state of differentiation of the B lymphocyte and may lead to distinct cellular outcomes (11Goodnow C.C. Cyster J.G. Hartley S.B. Bell S.E. Cooke M.P. Healy J.I. Akkaraju S. Rathmell J.C. Pogue S.L. Shokat K.P. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 59: 279-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling differences in response to BCR engagement have been documented between immature and mature B cells, and these differences may lead to cell death in the former but activation in the latter (12Monroe J.G. Kass M.J. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 1674-1682PubMed Google Scholar, 13Norvell A. Mandik L. Monroe J.G. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4404-4413PubMed Google Scholar). Naïve B cells that have yet to encounter antigens and tolerant B cells that are chronically exposed to self-antigens also differ in their BCR signaling events, in particular the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the transcription factors NF-κB and NF-AT (14Healy J.I. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmerman L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).The MAPKs are serine/threonine protein kinases, and they couple receptor signaling to cellular responses such as proliferation, differentiation, and cell death (15Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The three major classes of MAPKs are the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), and the p38 MAPK (16Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). ERK has been implicated in cell growth and proliferation (17Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar), whereas JNK and p38 MAPK appear to be involved in stress response and apoptosis (18Graves J.D. Draves K.E. Craxton A. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13814-13818Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar,19Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of the BCR activates all three classes of MAPKs in naïve B cells, but only ERK is activated in tolerant B cells (14Healy J.I. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmerman L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), whereas the activation of p38 MAPK is not known. The transcription factor NF-κB regulates genes involved in survival and proliferation (20Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 80: 529-532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), whereas NF-AT seems to regulate genes involved in cellular homeostasis and differentiation (21Peng S.L. Gerth A.J. Ranger A.M. Glimcher L.H. Immunity. 2001; 14: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). BCR signaling induces the activation of both NF-κB and NF-AT in naïve B cells, whereas the activation of NF-AT is constitutive but that of NF-κB is blocked in tolerant B cells (14Healy J.I. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmerman L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).Since differences in BCR signaling have been documented between immature and mature B cells and between naïve and tolerant B cells, it is assumed that B-1 and B-2 cells may also differ in their induction of the various signaling pathways. Indeed, it is known that the activation of the transcription factor STAT-3 is constitutive in B-1 cells but only induced in B-2 cells (22Karras J.G. Wang Z. Huo L. Howard R.G. Frank D.A. Rothstein T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, in this report, we systematically examine whether the various common signaling pathways that are induced by BCR engagement in B-2 cells, namely those of phospholipase C (PLC)-γ2, MAPKs, Akt, NF-κB, and NF-AT, are also differentially activated in B-1 cells. The study of the signaling pathways activated by BCR engagement on B-1 cells may shed light to the origins of this subset of B lymphocytes.RESULTSVH12-expressing B-1 Cells Are Found in Normal Mice—B-1 cells represent a minor B cell subset and typically constitute 1–3% of the B cells found in the spleen, although they are enriched in the peritoneum of mice (26Kantor A.B. Herzenberg L.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 501-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1A, comparison of the B cells found in the spleen and peritoneal cavity of normal mice revealed that peritoneal B-1 cells differ from the splenic conventional B (or B-2) cells with respect to their phenotypes. B-1 cells express a high level of IgM and low levels of B220 and IgD compared with B-2 cells. In addition, they are CD5+ and CD23−. Thus, B-1 and B-2 cells are distinct B cell subsets. Because of the paucity of B-1 cells in normal mice, there is a need to obtain an enriched source of these cells in order to study BCR signaling in B-1 cells.We have previously generated a strain of immunoglobulin knock-in mice, designated VH12f (23Lam K.P. Rajewsky K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), that carry a VH12 Ig heavy chain transgene. The VH12 heavy chain is derived from an antibody that recognizes phosphatidylcholine (27Mercolino T.J. Locke A.L. Afshari A. Sasser D. Travis W.W. Arnold L.W. Haughton G. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1869-1877Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), an antigenic specificity that is enriched in B-1 cells. Not surprisingly, as shown in Fig. 1A, VH12f mice develop predominantly B-1 cells that are IgMhighB220lowCD5+IgD−(23Lam K.P. Rajewsky K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In addition, as shown in Fig. 1B, close to 90% of the B cells in the peritoneal cavity of VH12f mice express the knock-in VH12 heavy chain as identified by FACS staining with the idiotypic anti-VH12 Ab. As such, these mice would provide an ideal source of B-1 cells for biochemical analyses. To ensure the relevance of using the transgenic VH12-expressing B-1 cells, we show that VH12-expressing B cells are naturally occurring and formed a sizable fraction (close to 2%) of the normal B-1 cell repertoire in the peritoneal cavity of wild-type mice.Next, we showed that VH12-expressing B-1 cells can be isolated with great purity from the peritoneal cavity of VH12f mice (Fig. 1C) using a procedure that does not lead to the stimulation of the BCR. Similarly, conventional B-2 cells can also be purified from the spleens of wild-type mice for comparative study. Thus, the use of transgenic VH12-expressing B-1 cells from the peritoneal cavity of VH12f mice (23Lam K.P. Rajewsky K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) would greatly facilitate the study of the biochemical properties of B-1 cells.Transgenic VH12-expressing B-1 Cells Do Not Proliferate in Response to BCR Engagement but Exhibit Extended Survival in VitroTo further ensure that the transgenic VH12-expressing B-1 cells behave like normal B-1 cells found in wild-type mice, we examined their response to BCR stimulation. In all experiments described in this paper, BCR signaling is induced using anti-IgM F(ab′)2 antibodies. It is known that B-1 cells, unlike B-2 cells, do not proliferate when their BCRs are cross-linked (28Bikah G. Carey J. Ciallella J.R. Tarakhovsky A. Bondada S. Science. 1996; 274: 1906-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Indeed, transgenic VH12-expressing B-1 cells did not respond to anti-IgM stimulation regardless of the dosage given (Fig. 2A). This was in contrast to the dose-dependent proliferation of B-2 cells. However, as control, we showed that VH12-expressing B-1 cells were not completely refractory to stimulation, since they did proliferate in response to LPS treatment, albeit to a much lesser extent compared with B-2 cells (Fig. 2B).FIG. 2B-1 cells do not proliferate in response to anti-IgM stimulation but exhibit extended survival in culture. Purified B-1 and B-2 cells were stimulated for 48 h with increasing concentrations of goat anti-mouse IgM F(ab′)2 fragment (A) or LPS (B). Cell proliferation was quantified by H3 incorporation.C, purified B-1 and B-2 cells were cultured for various numbers of days, and the number of remaining live cells was quantified by trypan blue exclusion. Results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Another property of B-1 cells is their extended survival in culture compared with B-2 cells (29Hayakawa K. Hardy R.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 197-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In contrast to B-2 cells that undergo apoptosis rapidly within a day in culture, VH12-expressing B-1 cells can survive for extended period of time in vitrowithout dying, as shown in Fig. 2C. Taken together, the data suggest that the transgenic VH12-expressing B-1 cells behave like normal B-1 cells and further support the notion that they would serve as a suitable model system to study the properties of this unique subset of B cells. Henceforth, VH12-expressing B-1 cells will be designated simply as B-1 cells.Lack of BCR-induced NF-κB Activation in B-1 CellsGiven the physiological differences seen in B-1 and B-2 cells, in particular in their different proliferative response to BCR cross-linking, we proceeded to examine if BCR stimulation would induce different signaling events in these two B cell subsets.BCR signaling is known to activate the transcription factor NF-κB that regulates genes involved in cell proliferation and survival (30Liu J.L. Chiles T.C. Sen R.J. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1685-1691PubMed Google Scholar). The predominant form of NF-κB in B cells is the p50-c-Rel heterodimer (31Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar), and in particular, c-Rel is shown to be essential for B cell proliferation after BCR engagement (31Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5544) Google Scholar, 32Gerondakis S. Grumont R. Rourke I. Grossmann M. Curr. Opin.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 4948-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).As expected, treatment of B-2 cells with anti-IgM or a combination of PMA and ionomycin led to the activation of NF-κB in these cells, as evidenced by the increased binding of nuclear NF-κB proteins to an oligoprobe that contained the NF-κB consensus binding site (Fig.3A, right). In contrast, there was no significant induction of NF-κB above the background level in BCR-stimulated B-1 cells, and as control, the treatment of B-1 cells with PMA and ionomycin did result in the activation of this transcription factor (Fig. 3A, left).FIG. 3Lack of NF-κB activation in B-1 cells due to the absence of induced degradation of IκB proteins. A, nuclear extracts from nontreated (U), anti-IgM (Ig), or PMA/ionomycin (P/I)-stimulated B-1 and B-2 cells were examined for NF-κB binding activity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. B, Western blot analysis of Bcl-xLexpression in B-1 and B-2 cells that were nontreated (U) or stimulated with anti-IgM (Ig) or LPS for 48 h. The anti-tubulin blot serves as a control for the loading of whole cell lysates. C, Western blot analysis of IκBα degradation in nontreated (U) or PMA/ionomycin (P/I)- or anti-IgM (Ig)-stimulated B-1 and B-2 cells. The anti-c-Rel blot was used as a control for the loading of whole cell lysates.D, Western blot analysis of c-Rel translocation into the nuclei of B-1 and B-2 cells that were either nontreated (U) or stimulated with anti-IgM (Ig) or PMA/ionomycin (P/I). The blot was first probed with anti-c-Rel Ab and subsequently reprobed with anti-TFIID Ab to control for the amount and integrity of the nuclear extracts used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To confirm that NF-κB was indeed not activated in BCR-stimulated B-1 cells, we examined the induction of one of its target genes, bcl-x (34Lee H.H. Dadgostar H. Cheng Q. Shu J. Cheng G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9136-9141Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 35Glasgow J.N. Wood T. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1377-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, the expression of Bcl-xL was up-regulated in B-2 cells in response to either anti-IgM or LPS treatment. However, treatment of B-1 cells with anti-IgM antibodies did not lead to the expression of Bcl-xL, consistent with a lack of NF-κB activation in these cells. As control, B-1 cells did express Bcl-xL after LPS treatment. Taken together, the data indicate that NF-κB is not activated in B-1 cells after BCR stimulation.To determine the reason for the lack of NF-κB activation in B-1 cells, we next examined the molecular events leading to its activation. In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB/Rel factors are sequestered in the cytoplasm by the inhibitory (I)-κB family of proteins (36Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Upon specific stimulation, the IκB kinases are activated, and this leads to the serine/threonine phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB proteins and the release of NF-κB/Rel proteins for translocation into the nucleus to effect gene transcription (37Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar,38Sha W.C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, treatment of B-2 cells with anti-IgM antibodies or a combination of PMA and ionomycin led to the degradation of the IκB proteins as indicated by the loss of IκBα subunit in Western blot analyses of whole cell lysates. Concomitantly, there was an increase in c-Rel translocation into the nucleus of anti-IgM- or PMA/ionomycin-stimulated B-2 cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast, IκBα proteins were not degraded in IgM-stimulated B-1 cells (Fig. 3C), and there was a lack of c-Rel translocation into the nucleus of these cells (Fig. 3D). Again, as control, IκBα could be degraded, and nuclear translocation of c-Rel was effected in PMA/ionomycin treated B-1 cells. Thus, in B-1 cells, IκB proteins specifically do not degrade in response to BCR signaling, and this results in a lack of NF-κB activation in these cells.Intact Btk but Reduced PLC-γ2 and Lack of Protein Kinase B/Akt Activation in IgM-stimulated B-1 CellsTwo signaling pathways have been linked to NF-κB activation (39Jones R.G. Parsons M. Bonnard M. Chan V.S. Yeh W.C. Woodgett J.R. Ohashi P.S. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1721-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 40Petro J.B. Rahman S.M. Ballard D.W. Khan W.N. J.

Med. 2000; 191: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In B cells, the Btk-PLC-γ2 pathway has been shown to be essential for NF-κB activation in B cells (42Petro J.B. Khan W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1715-1719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that the expression or activation of these signaling molecules may be altered in B-1 compared with B-2 cells. Thus, we first examined the activation of Btk in nontreated and anti-IgM-stimulated B-1 and B-2 cells. Western blot analysis of tyrosine-phosphorylated Btk indicated that Btk was activated with the same kinetics in both anti-IgM-stimulated B-1 and B-2 cells (Fig. 4A). Next, we examined the activation of the downstream PLC-γ2 in nontreated and anti-IgM-stimulated B-1 and B-2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, PLC-γ2 was expressed equivalently in both B-1 and B-2 cells and could be activated by anti-IgM treatment. However, in B-1 cells, the PLC-γ2 activation appeared to tail off faster at the 30 s time point. Since the intact phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 in B-1 cells seems inconsistent with the lack of NF-κB activation, we directly examined the enzymatic activity of PLC-γ2. PLC-γ2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) into diacylglycerol and IP3. Hence, its activity can be assayed by measuring the production of IP3. As shown in Fig. 4C, the generation of IP3 was observed to be reduced in anti-IgM-stimulated B-1 cells as compared with that of B-2 cells. Hence, the reduced activity of PLC-γ2 in B-1 cells may impact upon NF-κB activation after BCR stimulation.FIG. 4Intact Btk , reduced PLC -γ2, and lack of Akt activation in anti-IgM-stimulated B-1 cells. A, normal activation of Btk in B-1 and B-2 cells. Whole cell lysates from B-1 and B-2 cells that were treated with 20 μg/ml anti-IgM Abs for various times were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20)-agarose and probed with anti-Btk Ab. The numbers below the blot indicate the -fold difference in phosphorylation with respect to the unstimulated sample. B, reduced phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 in B-1 cells. Cell lysates from B-1 and B-2 cells treated as inA were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLC-γ2, probed with anti-PY20, and later reprobed with the immunoprecipitating Ab for loading control. Numbers below the blot indicate the -fold difference in phosphorylation with respect to the unstimulated sample. C, kinetics of IP3generation from nontreated and anti-IgM stimulated B-1 and B-2 cells. Results shown are representative of two separate experiments.D, absence of Akt activation in B-1 cells. Whole cell lysates from B-1 and B-2 cells treated as in A were immunoprecipitated with anti-Akt and probed with anti-pAktS473 (upper panel) or anti-pAktT308 (lower panel) Abs. The blots were reprobed with the immunoprecipitating Ab to check for equal loading of cell lysates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Another signaling pathway that is activated by the cross-linking of the BCR on B-2 cells is that of the serine/threonine kinase, Akt, or protein kinase B (43Gold M.R.

Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Akt is an important signaling molecule that has also been implicated in the activation of NF-κB (39Jones R.G. Parsons M.

J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar, 49Pogue S.L. Kurosaki T. Bolen J. Herbst R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1300-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) in many different biological systems. We therefore also examined the activation status of Akt in B-1 cells.The activity of Akt is dependent on phosphorylation, and Akt can be phosphorylated on two potential sites: Thr308 and Ser473. Western blot analyses using specific antibodies that recognized either of the phosphorylated residues of Akt indicated that both sites were phosphorylated in BCR-stimulated B-2 cells (Fig.4D). In contrast, neither Thr308 nor Ser473 was phosphorylated in B-1 cells, regardless of the duration of BCR stimulation. Thus, Akt is not activated in IgM-stimulated B-1 cells. This, together with the reduced PLCγ2 activity, could explain the lack of NF-κB activation in B-1 cells upon BCR engagement.Differential Induction of Mitogen-activated Protein Kinases in B-1 and B-2 CellsBCR engagement is also known to activate the MAPK signaling pathways that have been shown to regulate cell growth, differentiation, and death in various biological systems (15Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The three major classes of MAPKs are the ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. B cells at different stages of differentiation may activate different MAPKs when triggered via their BCRs (50Sutherland C.L. Heath A.W. Pelech S.L. Young P.R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3381-3390PubMed Google Scholar); for example, tolerant B cells have constitutive ERK but failed to induce JNK activation (14Healy J.I. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmerman L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).To determine the pattern of MAPK activation in B-1 cells, we stimulated these cells with anti-IgM antibodies for various times, and the activation of the different classes of MAPKs was examined using phosphorylation state-specific antibodies. Anti-IgM-treated B-2 cells were used as controls, since all classes of MAPKs could be activated in these cells following stimulation.As shown in Fig. 5A, Western blot analysis using anti-phospho-ERK antibody indicated that ex vivo B-1 cells had a basal level of constitutive ERK activation compared with B-2 cells. This basal level of ERK activation in B-1 cells could be further up-regulated as indicated by the increased amount of phosphorylated ERK that was detected after anti-IgM stimulation (Fig. 5B). An in vitro kinase assay using myelin basic protein as a substrate indicates that this basal level of phospho-ERK in B-1 cells was indeed active (Fig.5C). In contrast, although ERK was activated in B-2 cells within 3 min and sustained for at least 30 min after anti-IgM stimulation, there was clearly a lack of basal ERK activity in these cells as shown by a lack of anti-phospho-ERK antibody staining or ERK activity in phosphorylating the myelin basic protein substrate (Fig. 5, A and C). Furthermore, BCR stimulation seemed to induce a greater level of phosphorylation and hence activation of ERK in B-1 cells compared with B-2 cells (Fig. 5B).FIG. 5Differential activation of ERK , JNK , and p38 MAPK in B-1 a"
https://openalex.org/W2169301071,"Glycan chains on glycoconjugates traversing the Golgi apparatus are often terminated by sialic acid residues, which can also be 9-O-acetylated. This process involves competition between multiple Golgi enzymes. Expression levels of Golgi enzyme mRNAs do not always correlate with enzyme activity, which in turn cannot accurately predict glycan sequences found on cell surfaces. Here we examine the cell type-specific expression of terminal glycans in tissues of normal mice in comparison with animals deficient in ST6Gal-I (transfers alpha2-6-linked sialic acid to Galbeta1-4GlcNAc) or ST3Gal-I (transfers alpha2-3-linked sialic acid to Galbeta1-3GalNAc). Tissues of ST6Gal-I null mice showed minimal binding of an alpha2-6-sialic acid-specific lectin, indicating that no other enzyme generates Siaalpha2-6Galbeta1-4GlcNAc and that Siaalpha2-6GalNAc (sialyl-Tn) is rare in mice. However, exposed Galbeta1-4GlcNAc termini were only moderately increased, indicating that these can be partially capped by other enzymes. Indeed, Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc and Fucalpha1-2Galbeta1-4GlcNAc termini were enhanced in some tissues. Many tissues of ST3Gal-I null animals showed increases in Galbeta1-3GalNAc termini, and some increases in poly-N-acetyllactosamines. However, overall expression of alpha2-3-linked sialic acid was selectively reduced only in a few instances, indicating that other ST3Gal enzymes can generate this linkage in most tissues. Highly selective losses of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid residues were also observed, with ST6Gal-I deficiency causing loss on endothelium and ST3Gal-I deficiency giving a marked decrease on CD4(+) lymphocytes. These data demonstrate selective regulation of sialylation and 9-O-acetylation, point to cell types with potential physiological defects in null animals, and show in vivo evidence for competition between Golgi enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W2078207948,"Progression through the early G1 phase of the cell cycle requires mitogenic stimulation, which ultimately leads to the activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (Cdk4/6). Cdk4/6 activity is promoted by D-type cyclins and opposed by Cdk inhibitor proteins. Loss of c-myc proto-oncogene function results in a defect in the activation of Cdk4/6. c-myc−/− cells express elevated levels of the Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1 and reduced levels of Cdk7, the catalytic subunit of Cdk-activating kinase. We show here that in normal (c-myc+/+) cells, the majority of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes are assembled with p27 and remain inactive during cell cycle progression; their function is presumably to sequester p27 from Cdk2 complexes. A small fraction of Cdk4/6 protein was found in lower molecular mass catalytically active complexes. Conditional overexpression of p27 in c-myc+/+ cells caused inhibition of Cdk4/6 activity and elicited defects in G0-to-S phase progression very similar to those seen in c-myc−/− cells. Overexpression of cyclin D1 in c-myc−/− cells rescued the defect in Cdk4/6 activity, indicating that the limiting factor is the number of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes. Cdk-activating kinase did not rescue Cdk4/6 activity. We propose that the defect in Cdk4/6 activity in c-myc−/− cells is caused by the elevated levels of p27, which convert the low abundance activable cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes into unactivable complexes containing higher stoichiometries of p27. These observations establish p27 as a physiologically relevant regulator of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 activity as well as mechanistically a target of c-Myc action and provide a model by which c-Myc influences the early-to-mid G1 phase transition.

Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1504-1512Crossref Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). Cyclin D-Cdk4/6 1 complexes are believed to mediate a key signaling connection between the extracellular environment and the intrinsic cell cycle clock. Inappropriate activation of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes and the consequent hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) are common events in a variety of human tumors (2Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4326) Google Scholar, 3Hall M. Peters G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 67-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes has been implicated as the major function of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes (4Geng Y. Whoriskey W. Park M.Y. Bronson R.T. Medema R.H., Li, T. Weinberg R.A. Sicinski P. Cell. 1999; 97: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The activation process of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes by cyclin D-Cdk4/6 has been shown to involve both catalytic and stoichiometric mechanisms, viz. the phosphorylation of Rb and the sequestration of the Cdk inhibitors p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, respectively (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1504-1512Crossref Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). In normal cells, however, both cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes appear to be required in sequential fashion to elicit the hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of Rb (5Lundberg A.S. Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). The expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene is closely correlated with proliferation, and removal of growth factors at any point in the cell cycle results in its prompt down-regulation (6Henriksson M. Luscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Dang C.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar). c-myc is not expressed in quiescent cells, but is rapidly induced by growth factors (8Kelly K. Cochran B.H. Stiles C.D. Leder P. Cell. 1983; 35: 603-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar, 9Waters C.M. Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Moore J.P. Evan G.I. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 797-805PubMed Google Scholar); and ectopic expression in quiescent cells can elicit entry into S phase (10Kaczmarek L. Hyland J.K. Watt R. Rosenberg M. Baserga R. Science. 1985; 228: 1313-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 11Eilers M. Schirm S. Bishop J.M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Overexpression of c-Myc in growing cells leads to reduced growth factor requirements and a shortened G1 phase (12Karn J. Watson J.V. Lowe A.D. Green S.M. Vedeckis W. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 773-787PubMed Google Scholar), whereas reduced expression causes lengthening of the cell cycle (13Shichiri M. Hanson K.D. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 93-104PubMed Google Scholar). c-Myc has been likened to a cell-autonomous rheostat, with engineered changes in its expression resulting in incremental changes in proliferation largely independent of the outside environment (14Hanson K.D. Shichiri M. Follansbee M.R. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A striking parallel between the cyclin D and c-Myc pathways is that both act as growth factor sensors by channeling environmental cues to drive the cell cycle engine. However, the manner in which they may be mechanistically connected is not understood. We used gene targeting to eliminate c-myc expression in an immortalized rat fibroblast cell line (15Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). The c-myc−/− cells are viable, but display a significant lengthening of both G1 and G2, resulting in a 3-fold reduced proliferation rate. Analysis of key cell cycle regulatory components showed that the absence of c-Myc coordinately reduced the activity of all cyclin-Cdk complexes (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The expression of the p27 protein was elevated 2–3-fold, and the expression of Cdk7 was reduced by a similar factor. During entry of quiescent cells into the cell cycle, the earliest and largest defect was a >10-fold reduction of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 activity, which resulted in a significant delay in the phosphorylation of Rb. Although the expression of Cdk4 is reduced in c-myc−/− cells (17Hermeking H. Rago C. Schuhmacher M., Li, Q. Barrett J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connell B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W. Kohlhuber F. Dang C.V.

A. 2000; 97: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), the defect in Cdk4/6 activity during the G0-to-S phase transition is significantly greater (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In this study, we report an analysis of the role of p27 and Cdk7 in the regulation of Cdk4/6 activity in the presence and absence of c-Myc. TGR-1 is a subclone of the Rat-1 cell line, and HO15.19 is a c-myc-null derivative constructed by sequential gene targeting (15Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). HO15.19 derivatives expressing ectopic cyclin D1 were constructed by retrovirus vector transduction of full-length murine or human cyclin D1 cDNA (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Rat1p27 cells express p27 under the control of the tTA (18Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar) and were obtained from Bruno Amati (19Alevizopoulos K. Catarin B. Vlach J. Amati B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5987-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Rat1p27 cells were grown in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline to block the expression of p27. Great care was taken that cultures were cycling asynchronously and were in a rapid and exponential phase of growth. Briefly, cells were always split at subconfluent densities (<50%) and at relatively low dilution (1:10 for c-myc+/+ and 1:4 for c-myc−/− cells). Cultures can thus be maintained continuously at densities of 10–50% confluence (to avoid any contact inhibition), and the relatively frequent passaging (every 3–4 days) and media changes maintain a rapid growth rate. This regimen was followed for a minimum of two passages before cells were harvested for biochemical experiments. In G0 synchronization experiments, Rat1p27 cells were trypsinized and replated in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline (p27-OFF condition) or 0 μg/ml tetracycline (p27-ON condition) 12–16 h prior to serum starvation (0.25% calf serum), which was initiated in 95% confluent cultures and maintained for 48 h. To induce cell cycle re-entry, cells were trypsinized and replated at 50% confluence in the presence of 10% calf serum. Tetracycline concentrations were kept constant throughout the starvation and restimulation periods. Flow cytometry was performed as indicated (15Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of cells with CFSE was performed as described (20Nikiforov M.A. Kotenko I. Petrenko O. Beavis A. Valenick L. Lemischka I.

Cells were labeled in suspension for brief periods of time (5 min) and then replated under standard exponential phase culture conditions. Cells were cultured for a minimum of one cell cycle (24 h for c-myc+/+ and 48 h for c-myc−/− cells) to allow the clearing of unincorporated dye before the dye dilution experiments were commenced. Samples for immunoblotting were prepared by direct rapid lysis in Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed as described (14Hanson K.D. Shichiri M. Follansbee M.R. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5748-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22Lu K.K. Bazarov A.V. Yoon L.S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 367-380PubMed Google Scholar). The sources of antibodies were as follows: Pharmingen, Rb (14001A); and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cyclin D1 (sc-450), cyclin A (sc-596), cyclin B1 (sc-245), Cdk4 (sc-260), Cdk2 (sc-163), Cdk6 (sc-177), and p27 (sc-528 and sc-1641). Kinase assays were performed as described (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 23Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures at the indicated time points were harvested with trypsin; washed with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline; and lysed for 2 h at 4 °C in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Tween 20, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Cyclin D1 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of extract with 1 μg of anti-cyclin D1 antibody and 20 μl of Gammabind G-Sepharose beads (AmershamBiosciences). Cdk2 was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of extract with 1 μg of anti-Cdk2 antibody and 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma). 1 μg of glutathione S-transferase-Rb (24Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and 2 μg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used as substrates to assay Cdk4 and Cdk2 activities, respectively. Kinase reactions were displayed by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with a PhosphorImager. CAK activation assays of Cdk4 and Cdk2 complexes were performed as described (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). TGR-1 or HO15.19 cultures in exponential growth were lysed as described for kinase assays. 1 mg of total protein (300 μl of extract) was chromatographed on a Superdex 200 column (24-ml bed volume) using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The column was run in lysis buffer and calibrated with gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). 500-μl fractions were collected; 80 μl of each fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting, and the remainder was immunoprecipitated and assayed for Cdk kinase activity as described above. The composition and activity of cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes were examined in growing c-myc+/+ and c-myc−/− cells by size exclusion chromatography. Both cultures were cycling asynchronously in a rapid and exponential phase of growth (see “Materials and Methods”). Column fractions were immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin D1 antibody; assayed for Cdk4 kinase activity; and then immunoblotted with antibody to cyclin D1, Cdk4, or p27 (Fig. 1). In both c-myc+/+ and c-myc−/− cells, the Cdk4 and cyclin D1 proteins coeluted as a broad peak between 50 and 200 kDa. The p27 protein eluted as a sharper peak between 100 and 200 kDa. Cdk4 activity peaked in two fractions between 70 and 100 kDa and was reduced ∼3-fold in c-myc−/− cells. The elution profile of Cdk6 was the same as that of Cdk4 (data not shown). The Rat-1 cells under study here express very low levels of cyclins D2 and D3 (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), which precluded their analysis. Densitometric analysis of the immunoblots revealed that in c-myc+/+ cells, ∼80% of the Cdk4 protein was found in 125–200-kDa complexes that were catalytically inactive and comigrated with the peak of the p27 protein. p27 thus appears to be capable of both binding and inhibiting the activity of cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes. Only a relatively small fraction of the Cdk4 protein (20%) was found in lower molecular mass (70–100 kDa) catalytically active complexes that migrated adjacent to the major peak of the Cdk4, cyclin D1, and p27 proteins. Although the resolution of the columns did not allow us to determine whether the lower molecular mass catalytically active complexes were free of p27 or contained low stoichiometries of p27, several reports in the literature indicate that both p27 and p21 promote the assembly of cyclin D-Cdk4/6 complexes at low stoichiometries without inhibiting the Rb kinase activity, but inhibit the activity at higher stoichiometries (25Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 26Blain S.W. Montalvo E. Massagué J. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). The c-myc−/− elution profile contained clearly elevated levels of p27, and the peak was broader. The levels of both the cyclin D1 and Cdk4 proteins were also slightly elevated in c-myc−/− cells despite the fact that the mRNAs are down-regulated (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 17Hermeking H. Rago C. Schuhmacher M., Li, Q. Barrett J.F. Obaya A.J. O'Connell B.C. Mateyak M.K. Tam W. Kohlhuber F. Dang C.V.

A. 2000; 97: 2229-2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), suggesting that p27 stabilizes cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes. This observation is consistent with previous reports that the half-life of the cyclin D1 protein is increased in both p27 and p21 complexes (27LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M.

A recent report indicates that c-Myc may affect the frequency of productive cell cycles (30Holzel M. Kohlhuber F. Schlosser I. Holzel D. Luscher B. Eick D. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that the cultures under examination here may be mixtures of cycling and non-cycling cells and that the observed changes in Cdk4 activity may be caused by variable fractions of cycling cells. To address this issue, we performed a careful analysis of proliferation rates (Fig.1B); the resultant growth curves show that both cultures were kinetically in exponential phase. Only if a constant fraction of cells were leaving the cycle at each division would the bulk culture still give the appearance of exponential kinetics. To further examine whether the cultures were composed of discrete cohorts of cycling and non-cycling cells, we monitored the dilution of the vital dye CFSE for several days under our standard exponential phase growth conditions. CFSE is a fluorescent dye that penetrates cell membranes and is metabolized and trapped within cells. The dye is evenly distributed to daughter cells, so fluorescence intensity decreases by half with each cell division. This method has been widely used in immunology (31Lyons A.B. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and neurobiology (32Groszer M. Erickson R. Scripture-Adams D.D. Lesche R. Trumpp A. Zack J.A. Kornblum H.I. Liu X. Wu H. Science. 2001; 294: 2186-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar) to track cells both in vitro and in vivo for up to 10 generations. Dye dilution was found to be completely uniform in both c-myc+/+ and c-myc−/− cell lines (Fig. 1C). In this experiment, cohorts of non-cycling (or slowly cycling) cells would be visualized as discrete peaks (or shoulders) at higher fluorescence intensity values. However, the peaks were found to be symmetrical and of the same width in both cultures at all time points. Furthermore, the rate of dye dilution (decrease in fluorescence intensity as a function of time) was completely consistent with the doubling times measured by standard growth curves. We therefore conclude that under our conditions, both c-myc+/+ and c-myc−/− cultures are uniformly composed of continuously cycling cells. Because the majority of assembled cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes in normal (c-myc+/+) cells appeared to be catalytically inactive, we examined the assembly and activation process during entry into S phase. Quiescent cells were induced to enter the cell cycle; and samples were collected at 2-h intervals, immunoprecipitated with anti-cyclin D1 antibody, assayed for Rb kinase activity, and then immunoblotted with antibodies to the known components of the complexes (Fig. 2). The cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p27 proteins appeared abruptly and concomitantly in the immunoprecipitates at the 6-h time point. This time coincides with the induction of cyclin D1 mRNA expression (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Cdk6 proteins appeared in the cyclin D1 immunoprecipitates with kinetics that followed closely those of Cdk4 and p27 (data not shown). In contrast, the appearance of Rb kinase activity was significantly delayed and was not fully induced until the 12-h time point in c-myc+/+ cells (Fig. 2A, left panel). Examination of c-myc−/−cells revealed a very similar profile, except that the abundance of all the components was somewhat increased and that the Rb kinase activity was greatly reduced (Fig. 2B, left panel). A densitometric quantification of the immunoblots of cyclin D1, Cdk4, and p27 revealed that all proteins were present in the immunoprecipitates at low basal levels in quiescent cells and remained relatively constant at the 2- and 4-h time points (Fig. 2, Aand B, right panels). The maximum induction ratios were as follows: cyclin D1, 7-fold in c-myc+/+ cells and 11-fold in c-myc−/− cells; Cdk4, 6-fold in c-myc+/+ cells and 9-fold in c-myc−/− cells; and p27, 19-fold in c-myc+/+ cells and 48-fold in c-myc−/− cells. Gel filtration chromatography of extracts collected at the time of peak activity (12–14 h) revealed profiles very similar to those shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). c-myc+/+ and c-myc−/−cells express equivalent amounts of the Cdk inhibitors p15INK4b and p16INK4a (19Alevizopoulos K. Catarin B. Vlach J. Amati B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5987-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and neither express detectable levels of p18INK4c and p19INK4d(data not shown). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the majority of the newly synthesized cyclin D1 protein is rapidly assembled with Cdk4/6 and multiple molecules of p27. Of particular interest is the observation that complexes are apparently fully assembled at early times, but not activated until much later. The fact that the complexes are eventually activated without significant changes in overall stoichiometry further corroborates the interpretation that only a small fraction of total complexes become catalytically active. The observation that the majority of cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 complexes appear to be bound by multiple molecules of p27 and are not activated even in c-myc+/+ cells predicts that increasing the p27 pool will inhibit the remaining active complexes. Transient overexpression of p27 has been shown to cause G1 arrest (33Vlach J. Hennecke S. Alevizopoulos K. Conti D. Amati B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). A stable Rat-1-derived cell line, Rat1p27 (19Alevizopoulos K. Catarin B. Vlach J. Amati B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5987-5997Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in which p27 expression is controlled by the tTA tetracycline-controlled transactivator (18Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar), proliferates normally in the presence of 2 μg/ml tetracycline. Withdrawal of tetracycline, which induces p27 expression, reduced proliferation ∼2-fold (data not shown). To analyze the consequences of elevated p27 expression during progression from G0 to S phase, it was necessary to prepare quiescent cells with increased levels of p27. This was accomplished by removing tetracycline from the medium 12–16 h prior to as well as during a standard 48-h serum deprivation period. Cells thus treated were quiescent and displayed maximum p27 induction. Cell cycle re-entry was elicited by serum stimulation in the continued absence of tetracycline. Control cultures were treated identically, but were supplemented with 2 μg/ml tetracycline throughout the regimen to keep the p27 transgene inactive. Analysis of cell cycle progression by flow cytometry (Fig.3, A and B) showed normal S phase entry in the presence of tetracycline (p27-OFF) at 12 h after serum stimulation, the same as in parental Rat-1 cells. In the absence of tetracycline (p27-ON), the S phase peaks were significantly diminished as well as delayed to 16–18 h. This profile was similar to that seen in c-myc−/−cells, which began to enter S phase at 20–22 h. As previously reported (15Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 1039-1048PubMed Google Scholar), bromodeoxyuridine labeling analyses showed that the entire cell population was delayed in S phase entry and that entry was spread over a longer time period, rather than a portion of the culture failing to enter the cell cycle. Immunoblot analysis of Rat1p27 cells showed clearly elevated levels of the p27 protein in quiescent cells in the absence of tetracycline (p27-ON), but not in its presence (p27-OFF) (Fig. 3C). The elevated levels of p27 under the p27-ON condition persisted for >24 h after serum stimulation, but were reduced at later times, which may account for the leakiness of the block and continued proliferation in the absence of tetracycline, albeit at reduced rates. In agreement with the previous results, the levels of cyclin D1 were also noticeably increased in the presence of elevated p27. Given that increased p27 expression impeded S phase entry, we investigated the extent to which the molecular landmarks of this transition resembled those seen in c-myc−/−cells. The absence of c-Myc during the G0-to-S phase transition results in significantly reduced (>10-fold) Cdk4/6 activity, delayed phosphorylation of Rb, delayed and dampened activation of Cdk2, and delayed induction of cyclin A (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under the p27-OFF condition, the onset of Rb phosphorylation was first evident at 4 h, whereas under the p27-ON condition, significant Rb phosphorylation was minimum even at the 12-h time point (Fig.3C). 24 h after serum stimulation, Rb phosphorylation was still appreciably defective. In comparison, Rb phosphorylation is first detectable at 8 h in c-myc−/− cells and at 6 h in parental c-myc+/+ cells (16Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4672-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Rb phosphorylation thus appears to be even more defective in the presence of excess p27 than in the absence of c-Myc. The composition and activity of Cdk4 complexes were examined during the G0-to-S phase transition under the p27-OFF and p27-ON conditions and compared with the total expression of the constituent proteins. Immunoblot analysis (Fig.4A) showed that total cyclin D1 levels were highest early in the transition (6 h) and declined at later times (18 and 30 h) under the p27-OFF condition; in the p27-ON cells, cyclin D1 levels were elevated throughout and peaked at much later times (18 h). Cdk4 and Cdk2 levels were constant throughout the time course under both conditions. Cdk2 showed a shift to higher mobility indicative of CAK phosphorylation at 18 h in p27-OFF cells, but not until 30 h in p27-ON cells. This result is consistent with observations that p27 can antagonize the phosphorylation of Cdk complexes by CAK (34Koff A. Ohtsuki M. Polyak K. Roberts J.M. Massagué J. Science. 1993; 260: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 35Kato J. Matsuoka K. Polyak K. Massagué J. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 487-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation with anti-cyclin D1 antibody (Fig. 4B) from extracts of p27-OFF cells showed the expected induction of cyclin D1 early in the transition (6 h), and both the Cdk4 and p27 proteins were efficiently co-immunoprecipitated at this time. Cdk4 activity was strongly induced at later times. Under the p27-ON condition, cyclin D1-Cdk4 complexes were more abundant, were present at high levels at much later times, and at all times contained high levels of the p27 protein. The activity of the complexes was low throughout, although a weak induction was evident at 18 h. The defect in Cdk4 activation in the p27-ON cells was ∼15-fold in this experiment. A comparison of Cdk4 and Cdk2 activities and the induction of cyclins A and B1 were monitored in a separate experiment (Fig. 4C). In p27-OFF cells, strong induction of both Cdk4 and Cdk6 activities was detected at 16 h, whereas neither activity was apparent in p27-ON cells until 24 h. The defect in activation in p27-ON cells was 5–7-fold for both Cdk4 and Cdk2; however, Cdk4 activity was barely elevated above the background level in p27-ON cells, whereas Cdk2 activity was substantially induced. Thus, the defect in activation is more pronounced for Cdk4 than for Cdk2. Both cyclin"

Because PCAF (p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor) also acetylates and activates p53 after DNA damage, in this study we have examined the effect of MDM2 on PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation. We have found that MDM2 inhibited p53 acetylation by PCAF in vitro. In addition, when overexpressed, MDM2 inhibited PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation in cells. MDM2 interacted with PCAF both in vitro and in cells, as assessed using GST fusion protein interaction and immunoprecipitation assays, respectively. Consistent with the above results, MDM2 significantly repressed the activation of p53 transcriptional activity by PCAF without apparently affecting the level of p53. In addition, MDM2 co-resided with p53 at the p53-responsivemdm2 and p21waf1/cip1 promoters, inhibiting expression of the endogenous p21waf1/cip1.

Although less studied, thep300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) has also been shown to specifically acetylate the lysine 320 of p53, leading to the enhancement of the sequence-specific DNA binding activity of p53 in vitro (13Liu L.

The acetylation at lysine 320 is responsive to DNA damage as well (12Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E.

Consistent with this, deacetylation of p53 by HDAC1 and Sir2α deacetylases has been recently shown to inactivate p53 function (21Luo J., Su, F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W.

Additionally, adenovirus E1A and E1B 55-kDa oncoproteins inhibit p53 acetylation catalyzed by PCAF (25Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M.

Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, p53 is also negatively regulated by post-translational ubiquitination. This modification is mediated by the p53 suppressor, MDM2, which possesses a Ring finger E3-like ubiquitin ligase activity (27Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 28Fuchs S.Y. Adler V. Buschmann T., Wu, X. Ronai Z.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8945-8951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). It is believed that under physiological or normal conditions, the turnover rate of p53 is controlled by MDM2 through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome system (30Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 31Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar, 32Mendrysa S.M. Perry M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Upon cellular insults, p53 is phosphorylated and/or acetylated (3Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1167) Google Scholar). These modifications prevent p53 from attack by MDM2. Thus, p53 becomes stabilized and activated, transcriptionally activating the expression of its target genes. Because mdm2 is a p53 target (33Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar, 34Juven T. Barak Y. Zauberman A. George D.L. Oren M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3411-3416PubMed Google Scholar), more MDM2 proteins are produced after DNA damage to repress p53 function. Hence, under pathological or abnormal conditions, MDM2 must antagonize multiple enzymes, including kinases and acetylases, in order to monitor p53 function. How these proteins interplay to finely tune p53 activity becomes an important question. In an attempt to address this issue, we (16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and others (14Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) have recently shown that MDM2 inhibits p53 acetylation by p300 both in vitro and in vivo. Functionally, MDM2 blocked the ability of p300 to stimulate the sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activities of p53 (16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because interaction between p53 and MDM2 or MDM2 and p300 is required for inhibiting p300-mediated p53 acetylation by MDM2, MDM2 inhibits p53 acetylation by forming a ternary complex with p53 and p300 (16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to determine whether MDM2 is able to inhibit PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation and activation. In the study described here, we found that MDM2 inhibited p53 acetylation by PCAF in vitro. Furthermore, when overexpressed in cells, MDM2 inhibited PCAF-mediated p53 acetylationin vivo. MDM2 interacted with PCAF both in vitroand in cells, as assessed using GST fusion protein interaction and immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, MDM2 significantly repressed the activation of p53 transcriptional activity by PCAF. These results demonstrate that MDM2 can also inhibit PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation and activation. These studies support the idea that after DNA damage, MDM2, once induced by p53, needs to prevent p53 acetylation in order to efficiently ubiquitinate and degrade this protein.

Gene. 1991; 105: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pRSV-1–529 was constructed similarly by creatingNcoI and KpnI sites at the translation initiation codon and after the codon for residue 529, respectively. A stop codon was also inserted between codon 529 and the KpnI site. The resulting 1.6-kb NcoI/KpnI fragment was subsequently cloned between the NcoI and KpnI sites of pExpress-O (41Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Gene. 1991; 105: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). pRSV-Δ66–466 was constructed by digesting pRSV-PCAF with PstI, followed by subsequent religation. These vectors were used for in vitro translation of PCAF and PCAF deletion mutants with the TNT translation kit (Invitrogen). PCAF and p300 were purified from baculovirus-infected SF9 insect cells using immunoaffinity columns as described (37Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M.

Human embryonic kidney epithelial 293 cells were transfected with pCDNA3-HA-MDM2 or pCDNA3 vector. Transfected cells expressing HA-MDM2 were selected in the presence of neomycin (0.5 mg/ml) and screened by immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies followed by Western blot with the monoclonal anti-MDM2 antibody 2A10. p53 acetylation assays were carried out according to the published method (16Kobet E.

MDM2 was preincubated with p300 or PCAF in ice for 30 min prior to being added into the reaction mixture containing acetyl-CoA. The mixture was then incubated at 30 °C for 60 min and analyzed on SDS-PAGE afterward. Acetylated p53 was detected by Western blot using the polyclonal anti-acetylated lysine antibody. Monoclonal anti-p53 antibody 421, polyclonal anti-MDM2 antibody, and polyclonal anti-p300 or polyclonal anti-PCAF antibody from Upstate Biotechnology were used to detect corresponding proteins. Transfected cells were harvested for preparation of nuclear extracts.

Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). H1299 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-p53 or pCMV-MDM2 vector, alone or together. ChIP analysis was performed as described (42Shang Y., Hu, X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 43Szak S.T. Mays D. Pietenpol J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were cross-linked with a 1% formaldehyde solution in phosphate-buffered saline 36 h after transfection. The cross-linking was stopped by incubating the cells on 0.125m glycine for 5 min. The cells were then harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA) containing the protease inhibitors pepstatin A (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), dithiothreitol (1 mm), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μg/ml). Cell lysates were sonicated 4 times for 15 s each at maximal setting to yield chromatin fragments of ∼600 bp as assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis, followed by centrifugation for 10 min to remove the cell debris. Cell lysates were precleared with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose/2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA slurry for 30 min at 4 °C. A total of 2 μg of anti-Myc or anti-FLAG antibodies was incubated with the precleared extracts overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with protein A/G agarose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, 4 times with IP wash buffer (100 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 50 mm LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid), and twice more with lysis buffer. The precipitates were then extracted twice, each with 150 μl of IP elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS). The eluates were pooled, mixed with 2 μl of 5 mg/ml RNase A and 12 μl of 5 m NaCl (to 0.2 m), and incubated at 65 °C for at least 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde cross-linking. DNA fragments were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and dissolved in 100 μl of sterile H2O. DNA samples were then analyzed with 25 or 28 cycles of PCR to amplifymdm2 and p21waf1 promoter sequences containing the p53RE sequence. Each cycle consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s and annealing at 60 °C (mdm2promoter) or 65 °C (p21waf1 promoter) for 30 s, followed by extension at 72 °C for 2 min. A total of 0.5 μCi of [32P]dCTP was added in each 50 μl of PCR mixture. The primers for amplifying the mdm2 promoter sequence (33Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar) are 5′-GGTTGACTCAGCTTTTCCTCTTG-3′ and 5′-GGAAAATGCATGGTTT-AAATAGCC-3′ (inverse); the primers for amplifying the p21 promoter sequence (44el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar) are 5′-TGAATCTACTCTTGGTGGTCC-3′ and 5′-AAGGAAATTTGGGCTTTCGAC-3′ (inverse). PCR products were resolved onto 6% polyacrylamide gel, dried, and exposed on film. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 12B column. Protein-protein association assays were conducted as reported (37Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) using fusion protein-containing beads. Approximately 250 ng of FLAG-PCAF or in vitro translated and35S-labeled PCAF (4 μl), PCAF/1–529 (4 μl), or PCAF/Δ66–466 (8 μl) proteins were incubated with the GSH-Sepharose 4B beads (50% slurry) containing ∼100 ng of GST-MDM2, GST-MDM2/1–150, GST-MDM2/295–491, GST-MDM2/384–491, GST-MDM2/425–491, or GST, respectively. One hour after incubation at room temperature, the mixtures were washed once in BC100 containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, twice in SNNTE, and once in RIPA. Bound proteins were analyzed on a 10% SDS gel and detected by WB using the anti-FLAG or anti-PCAF monoclonal antibody to detect PCAF-GST-MDM2 interactions. It has been shown that MDM2 inhibits p300/CBP-mediated p53 acetylation (14Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar,16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation can also be inhibited by the adenovirus-encoding E1B 55-kDa oncoprotein (26Liu Y. Colosimo A.L. Yang X.J. Liao D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5540-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which like MDM2 represses p53 activity by binding to its N terminus (45Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and leads to p53 degradation (46Querido E. Blanchette P. Yan Q. Kamura T. Morrison M. Boivin D. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Branton P.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3104-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). To determine whether MDM2 is also able to affect PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation, we performed an in vitroacetylation assay using purified proteins. As shown in Fig.1A, as in the case of p300 (lane 3) (16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), MDM2 also repressed PCAF-catalyzed p53 acetylation in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro(lanes 5 and 6). With 2-fold more MDM2 than PCAF in molar ratio, less than 10% of p53 molecules were acetylated based upon densitometry (lane 6). This result was reproducible. By contrast, the p53-binding defective mutant MDM2 in the same molar ratio was unable to inhibit p53 acetylation by PCAF (Fig. 1B). PCAF did not appear to acetylate MDM2 in vitro (Fig.1C). Therefore, these results suggest that MDM2 can also inhibit p53 acetylation by PCAF, which specifically targets lysine 320 (12Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 13Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). This inhibition requires the interaction between p53 and MDM2. To further determine whether MDM2 inhibits PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation in cells, human p53-deficient small cell carcinoma H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p53 and/or FLAG-PCAF alone or together. Cells were harvested to assess the levels of these proteins and the acetylation status of p53 lysine 320 using antibodies specifically against acetylated lysine 320. As expected (12Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 13Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), FLAG-PCAF, when overexpressed, acetylated p53 at lysine 320 without significantly affecting the level of p53 (Fig.2A, compare lanes 2and 4). The same transfection was carried out in the presence or absence of the MDM2-encoding plasmid. In this experiment, the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, was added to medium 12 h prior to harvesting cells to prevent p53 degradation mediated by MDM2. As shown in Fig. 2B, PCAF again acetylated the lysine 320 of p53 (lanes 3 and 4). However, overexpression of MDM2 significantly reduced the level of this acetylation (lane 5 with lane 6). This reduction was not due to the low level of p53, because the level of p53 did not change in the presence or absence of MDM2. Furthermore, this inhibition was not due to the nonspecific effect of the plasmid, because it was not observed when the MDM2 deletion lacking the amino acid 130–250 region was used (Fig. 2C). This deletion mutant was unable to affect PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation largely because it lacks the nuclear localization sequence and is excluded from the nucleus (data not shown) (47Son K. Hong S.J. Green A. Chen J.J. Tzeng E. Hierholzer C. Billiar T.R. Chen L. Mol. Med. 1998; 4: 179-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results thus indicate that MDM2 inhibits PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation in cells. The finding that MDM2 inhibits PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation suggests a possible interaction between MDM2 and PCAF. To test this and also to define their potential binding domains, we performed a series of in vitro GST fusion protein-protein association assays. In the first experiment, purified FLAG-PCAF proteins were incubated with GST-MDM2 or GST-MDM2 deletion mutants as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After rigorous washing, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS electrophoresis and Western blot, using anti-FLAG antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3A, PCAF bound to the full-length as well as the N-terminal region from amino acid 1 to 295. These bindings appeared to be specific because PCAF rarely bound to GST alone or GST fusion proteins containing the C terminus (amino acids 384–491) of MDM2. Because PCAF also interacted with the N terminus-deleted MDM2 (data not shown), which lacks amino acids 1–50, these results suggest that PCAF can bind to the amino acid 50–384 region of MDM2. To map the MDM2-binding domain of PCAF, we carried out a similar GST-MDM2 pull-down experiment using in vitro translated and35S-labeled PCAF and deletion mutants. As shown in Fig.3B, PCAF as well as the N terminus (amino acids 1–529), but not the N terminus-deleted, fragment of PCAF bound to the GST-MDM2 protein (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lane 3). This binding was specific because none of these PCAF proteins interacted with the GST-MDM2 C-terminal domain (lanes 4–6). Taken together, these results demonstrate that MDM2 directly interacts with the N terminus of PCAF in vitro, whereas PCAF appears to bind to the same region of MDM2 to which p300/CBP binds (48Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). To determine the interaction between MDM2 and PCAF in cells, human embryonic kidney 293 cells, which contain endogenous MDM2, were transfected with pCX-FLAG-PCAF or pCX alone. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection for immunoprecipitation using antibodies against FLAG, MDM2, and Jnk1, followed by Western blot with antibodies against MDM2 and FLAG. As shown in Fig.4A, endogenous MDM2 proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-PCAF by the anti-FLAG antibody in FLAG-PCAF expression cells but not in mock-transfected cells (lanes 1 and 2). Consistently, FLAG-PCAF was also co-immunoprecipitated with the endogenous MDM2 by the monoclonal MDM2 antibody in the FLAG-PCAF expression cells but not in mock-transfected cells (lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that exogenous FLAG-PCAF associates with MDM2 in cells. This association was specific because none of these proteins was pulled down by the antibody against Jnk1 (lanes 5 and 6). To make sure that endogenous PCAF interacts with MDM2, we conducted an additional immunoprecipitation-Western blot experiment using 293 cells and an MDM2-expressing 293 stable cell line. The MDM2 cell line was used because the level of endogenous MDM2 in 293 cells is low (Fig.4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, both endogenous (lane 2) and exogenous (lane 1) MDM2 proteins were co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-PCAF antibody but not by the anti-Jnk1 antibody (lanes 3 and 4). Thus, this result confirms that MDM2 and PCAF interact with each other in cells. To determine the functional consequence of the inhibition of PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation by MDM2, we carried out transient transfection/luciferase assays. As shown in Fig.5A, expression of the exogenous PCAF enhanced p53-dependent transcription as measured by the luciferase activity that was driven by the p21waf1/cip1 promoter containing the p53RE motif. However, further expression of the exogenous MDM2 reversed the p53 activation by PCAF and brought p53-dependent luciferase activity down almost to the basal level. This decrease was not due to the loss of p53 proteins, because the level of p53 did not change dramatically in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132. This result, which was reproducible, demonstrates that MDM2 can also inhibit PCAF-enhanced p53 transcriptional activity without apparently affecting its level. Together with our previous report (16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), this suggests that MDM2 negatively regulates p53 activity at least in part by inhibiting its acetylation, which is catalyzed by p300/CBP and by PCAF. Because MDM2 can interact with p53RE-bound p53in vitro (49Liu Y. Asch H. Kulesz-Martin M.F. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5402-5406PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that MDM2 may repress p53 activity by directly associating with the promoter-bound p53 in cells. To test this idea, we performed a set of chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays, following transient transfection. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” H1299 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding p53 or MDM2 alone or together. Immunoprecipitations were conducted with polyclonal anti-p53 and monoclonal anti-MDM2 antibodies. PCR reactions were carried out using primers that encompass the p53RE-containing sequence of either the mdm2 or the p21waf1/cip1 promoter. The results are shown in Fig. 5B. As expected, p53 resided at both themdm2 and p21 promoters. Interestingly, MDM2 also localized at these promoters. This must be due to the association of MDM2 with p53, because MDM2 does not bind to DNA. In fact, without p53, overexpression of MDM2 (Fig. 5C) alone did not display detectable PCR products from the promoters (Fig. 5B, lane 5). Furthermore, when nonspecific primers upstream from the mdm2 promoter were used, no PCR product was detected from the immunoprecipitates with either anti-p53 or anti-HA-MDM2 antibodies. Consistently, MDM2 significantly repressed p53-mediated expression of the endogenous p21waf1/cip1 (Fig. 5C). Hence, these results demonstrate that MDM2 indeed associates with the promoter-bound p53, and this association might also play a role in negatively modulating p53 transcriptional activity. We previously showed (16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that MDM2 inhibited p300-catalyzed p53 acetylation by directly associating with these two proteins. Here, we have extended this work by demonstrating that MDM2 is also able to negate PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation at lysine 320. MDM2 inhibited PCAF-mediated p53 acetylation both in vitro and in cells (Figs. 1 and 2). As in the case of p300 (16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the N-terminal domain of MDM2 is required for this inhibition, suggesting that interaction with p53 is essential for the inhibitory effect of MDM2 on p53 acetylation by the acetylases that have been tested. Interestingly, MDM2 also directly interacted with PCAF in vitro and in cells (Figs. 3and 4). Similar to p300 (14Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 48Grossman S.R. Perez M. Kung A.L. Joseph M. Mansur C. Xiao Z.X. Kumar S. Howley P.M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 405-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), PCAF bound to the MDM2 region from amino acids 50 to 350 (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Functionally, MDM2 also repressed PCAF-enhanced p53 transcriptional activity. Because MDM2 co-resided with p53 on the endogenous p53-responsive promoters and repressed p53-dependent expression of the endogenous p21waf1/cip1 (Fig. 5, Band C), MDM2 might block p53 function by interfering with the communication between p53 and the transcriptional machinery (50Lu H. Lin J. Chen J. Levine A.J. Harvey Lect. 1994; 90: 81-93PubMed Google Scholar,51Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Yet it needs to be tested whether MDM2 inhibits p53 acetylation while it sits with p53 on the promoters. This study consistent with previous reports (14Ito A. Lai C.H. Zhao X. Saito S. Hamilton M.H. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 16Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) suggests a general model for MDM2 repression of p53 function after DNA damage (Fig.5D). In response to DNA damage, p53 is activated to induce expression of its target genes, including mdm2. Overexpression of MDM2, on the one hand, binds to p53 and its acetylases, such as p300/CBP or PCAF, to prevent p53 modifications by these proteins. In addition, deacetylases, such as HDCA1 and Sir2α, are activated by unknown mechanisms to deacetylate p53 (21Luo J., Su, F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 22Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S. Chen D., Su, F. Shiloh A. Guarente L. Gu W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20436-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Whether MDM2 promotes this deacetylation is not yet clear. Inhibition of p53 acetylation or deacetylation at the C-terminal lysines residues would allow MDM2 to efficiently ubiquitinate the same lysine residues of p53 (52Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9391-9398Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), thus leading to p53 degradation through the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome machinery (27Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 30Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 31Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar), although evidence linking p53 ubiquitination to its degradation has not yet been obtained. One study (53Lai Z. Ferry K.V. Diamond M.A. Wee K.E. Kim Y.B., Ma, J. Yang T. Benfield P.A. Copeland R.A. Auger K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31357-31367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) suggests that MDM2 might target multiple C-terminal lysines for mono-ubiquitination. If this is true, it is likely that MDM2 might target lysine 320 for ubiquitination as well. On the other hand, MDM2 also blocks p53 transcriptional activity by directly associating with this activator on the promoters and by inhibiting its acetylation at the C-terminal lysines. Through these multiple mechanisms, MDM2, as a feedback regulator (33Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1614) Google Scholar), effectively controls or balances p53 activity after DNA damage.

Here we report that various NSAIDs, such as the cyclooxygenase inhibitors, nimesulide, ibuprofen and indomethacin, as well as thalidomide (Thal) and its non-teratogenic analogue, supidimide, significantly stimulated the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic α-secretase form of the soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPPα) into the conditioned media of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and PC12 cells.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Aβ, a 39–43 amino acid peptide, is derived from a larger transmembrane glycoprotein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (4Cai X.D. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G.

APP can be processed proteolytically via alternative pathways; cleavages at the N and C termini of Aβ domain by β- and γ-secretases, respectively, lead to the formation of the Aβ peptide. In addition, in the α-secretase pathway, the cleavage occurs within the sequence of Aβ peptide and generates a large, secreted form of soluble APP (sAPP), thus precluding the formation of the amyloidogenic Aβ (for recent reviews of APP processing, see Refs. 6De Strooper B. Annaert W. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1857-1870Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand 7Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Because the proportion of APP processed by β-secretaseversus α-secretase may affect the amount of Aβ produced, the regulation of these two pathways may be critically important to the pathogenesis of AD. Previous studies have demonstrated that sAPP secretion could be enhanced by activation of various cell surface receptors, coupled to increased activation of second messenger cascades, including phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, tyrosine phosphorylation, protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), protein phosphatase 1 and 2B, and calcium (8Mills J. Reiner P.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In the search for the pathogenic mechanism of AD, much interest has been focused recently on the involvement of inflammatory reactions in AD. A chronic inflammatory response has been described in the brain of AD patients (9Rogers J. Webster S. Lue L.F. Brachova L. Civin W.H. Emmerling M. Shivers B. Walker D. McGeer P. Neurobiol. Aging. 1996; 17: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), characterized by the presence of activated astrocytes surrounding the senile plaque and activated microglia surrounding and extending processes into the plaque core (10Duffy P.E.

In addition, it was shown that Aβ produced neurotoxins, such as nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and glutamate, in microglial cells and astrocytes (26Ii M. Sunamoto M. Ohnishi K. Ichimori Y. Brain Res. 1996; 720: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 27El Khoury J. Hickman S.E. Thomas C.A. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. Loike J.D.

Based on these studies, it was suggested that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) might be effective in the prevention and treatment of AD. In support of this, several epidemiological and clinical studies have reported that the use of NSAIDs reduced the incidence and progression of AD (30McGeer P.L. Harada N. Kimura H. McGeer E.G. Schuler M. Dementia. 1992; 3Google Scholar, 31Breitner J.C. Welsh K.A. Helms M.J. Gaskell P.C. Gau B.A. Roses A.D. Pericak-Vance M.A. Saunders A.M.

Neurology. 1995; 45: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was reported that the NSAID, ibuprofen (Ibu), which has been associated with reduced AD risk in human epidemiological studies, significantly suppressed amyloid plaque pathology and inflammation in a transgenic mouse model of AD (33Lim G.P. Yang F. Chu T. Chen P. Beech W. Teter B. Tran T. Ubeda O. Ashe K.H. Frautschy S.A. Cole G.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5709-5714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Weggen et al. (34Weggen S. Eriksen J.L. Das P. Sagi S.A. Wang R. Pietrzik C.U. Findlay K.A. Smith T.E. Murphy M.P. Bulter T. Kang D.E. Marquez-Sterling N. Golde T.E. Koo E.H. Nature. 2001; 414: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1333) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a subset of NSAIDs preferentially decreased the highly amyloidogenic Aβ42 peptide produced from a variety of cultured cells, independently of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. Although the mechanism by which NSAIDs reduce the risk of AD is not entirely clear, they competitively inhibit COX catalytic activity, thereby reducing the production of inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs) from membrane-derived arachidonate. COX thus represents a possible target of NSAIDs action in the neurodegenerative mechanism. Furthermore, studies showing that COX-2 expression was elevated in the AD brain and correlated with the total Aβ content (35Pasinetti G.M. Aisen P.S.

Takahashi Y. Higashida H. Tanabe T. Yoshimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), strongly implicate Aβ in COX-2 activities. In addition, PGs produced by brain injury or inflammation have been shown to stimulate the synthesis of APP mRNA and APP holoprotein, whereas the immunosuppressants cyclosporin A and FK-506 inhibited PGE2-induced APP synthesis in primary culture of cortical astrocytes (41Lee R.K. Knapp S. Wurtman R.J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 940-947Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further elucidate the complex action of anti-inflammatory drugs in the neurodegenerative processes of AD, we investigated the effects of these drugs on the regulation of APP processing and the signaling pathways that are involved by using cultured human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and rat PC12 cells. In the present study, we examined the effect of the following anti-inflammatory COX inhibitors: Ibu and indomethacin (Indo), which are non-selective COX inhibitors, and nimesulide (Nim), which is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor. In addition, we studied the effects of thalidomide (Thal) and its non-teratogenic analogue, supidimide (Sup), which have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities that inhibit TNF-α and may represent candidates for the treatment of inflammatory conditions in which TNF-α-induced toxicities are involved. Nim, Ibu, and Indo were obtained from Sigma. Thal and Sup were a kind gift of Grunenthal GmbH (Aachen, Germany). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), GF109203X, calphostin C, PD98059, and U0126 were obtained from Calbiochem, dissolved (1 × 100) in dimethyl sulfoxide, and stored at −20 °C.

Anti-phospho-MAPK and anti-MAPK antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). PC12 cells, originated from rat pheochromocytoma, were grown to confluence in T75 flasks containing DMEM (1000 mg/liter glucose) and supplemented with 5% FCS, 10% horse serum, and 1% of a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin/nystatin. SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells were plated in 100-mm culture dishes and cultured in DMEM (4500 mg/liter glucose) containing 10% FCS and 1% of a mixture of penicillin/streptomycin/nystatin. Cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in a humid 5% CO2, 95% air environment. At 18–24 h before the experiments, the medium was replaced with DMEM with 0.5% FCS. After incubation with the drugs for the indicated periods, conditioned media were collected, and cells were lysed for subsequent analyses. Collected media were centrifuged at 3500 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C to remove the cellular debris, and the cleared supernatants were concentrated 10-fold by lyophilization. Cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails) for 10 min on ice. The cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the supernatants were saved at −20 °C until use. The protein amount in each sample was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Normalization of protein loading on each blot was obtained by loading a sample of concentrated conditioned medium, standardized to the protein concentration in the cell lysate. sAPP in the medium was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% gradient Tris-glycine-polyacrylamide gels (NOVEX Corporation, San Diego, CA) followed by immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes using either the monoclonal antibody 22C11 or the monoclonal antibody 6E10 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% bovine serum albumin. Cell lysates (30 μg of total protein/lane) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot with antibody 22C11 for the identification of the levels of cellular APP. Immunoreactivity was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and an enhanced chemiluminescence method (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were developed for different times to be within a linear range of response, and the relative intensity of immunoreactive bands on the exposed films was quantified by a computer-assisted densitometry program (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). Statistical analysis was done by one-way analysis of variance followed by two-tailed Student's t test; a value ofp < 0.05 was considered significant. Each experiment was repeated three to five times, and results from a representative experiment are shown. The kinase activity of the Erks was measured using the MAPK assay kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, for kinase activity assays, PC12 or SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were grown in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well). Before each experiment, the cells were exposed to DMEM with 0.5% FCS for 24 h, and then experimental treatments were performed in 0.5% FCS/DMEM with the vehicle or test drugs at 37 °C, as described in the figure legends. After treatment, reactions were stopped by placing cells on ice and aspirating the medium. Cells were harvested in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. Each cell lysate, containing 30 μg of protein, was separated on 4–12% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, immunoblotted, and identified using phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) antibody or p44/42 MAPK antibody. Data are representative of three to six independent experiments. To determine the action of NSAIDs on the secretion of sAPPα, we treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells with Nim, Ibu, Indo, Thal, or Sup and observed their dose dependence on sAPPα release into the medium. Fig.1 shows that treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells for 20 h with increasing concentrations of these drugs resulted in a significant, dose-dependent increase in sAPPα released into the medium as compared with the level in control, untreated cells. The maximal effect was obtained at concentrations of 0.1 and 1 μm, which resulted in an ∼2.5-fold increase in sAPPα secretion over the basal levels. However, the levels of sAPPα decreased upon treatment with high doses of the drugs (100 μm). The stimulation of sAPPα secretion by drugs showed the same pattern, whether immunoblotting was performed with the monoclonal antibody 22C11, which recognizes the N terminus of APP, or with the monoclonal antibody 6E10, which recognizes an epitope within residues 1–17 of the Aβ domain of APP, a site that constitutes the C terminus of sAPP, cleaved at the α site. Therefore, the identified bands can be assumed to be the α-secretase-cleaved form of sAPP. Fig.2 shows representative immunoblots, obtained for Nim and Thal, probed with the monoclonal antibody 6E10, and Table I summarizes the results of densitometric analysis, expressed as percentage of stimulated sAPPα, released into the culture medium. To exclude the possibility that this effect is specific to a particular cell type, we examined sAPPα secretion in response to NSAIDs in PC12 cells. Treatment of PC12 cells with increasing doses of Nim, Ibu, Indo, Thal, or Sup also resulted in a similar concentration-dependent increase in sAPPα release (data not shown). Fig. 3demonstrates the maximal effect of these drugs, obtained at concentrations of 1 and 10 μm. Thus, this effect was observed in cell lines of human and rat and is not dependent on cell type.Table IStimulation of sAPPα release by Nim and ThalDrugConcentration% of controlμmNim0.1261.4 ± 9.1**1213.6 ± 15.0*Thal0.1248.1 ± 24.9*1398.7 ± 18.3** Open table in a new tab FIG. 3Effect of NSAIDs on sAPP α release in PC12 cells.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 2464-2470Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the hydroxamic acid-based metalloprotease inhibitor, Ro31-9790, on Nim-, Thal-, or Sup-mediated sAPPα release from SH-SY5Y cells. As shown in Fig. 4, pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with 100 μm Ro31-9790 blocked Nim-, Thal-, or Sup-enhanced cleavage of sAPPα at both 1 and 10 μm concentrations of drugs. Thus, these findings demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory drugs affect APP processing by activating Ro31-9790-sensitive metalloprotease(s), further suggesting that their effect was mediated via α-secretase activity. The effects of NSAIDs on the levels of cellular APP were also determined. As can be seen in Fig. 5, Nim, Ibu, Indo, Thal, and Sup (1 or 10 μm) significantly reduced the levels of cellular APP holoprotein in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, relative to those in untreated cells (∼30% of control). No toxicity was detected by MTT (3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay in SH-SY5Y cells treated with these NSAIDs up to 100 μm(data not shown). sAPPα secretion was shown to be regulated in either a PKC-dependent or -independent fashion that involves activation of tyrosine kinases (8Mills J. Reiner P.B. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Moreover, the MAPK signaling pathway has recently been implicated in both PKC and tyrosine kinase receptor regulation of APP processing (45Mills J. Laurent Charest D. Lam F. Beyreuther K. Ida N. Pelech S.L. Reiner P.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 9415-9422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Desdouits-Magnen J. Desdouits F. Takeda S. Syu L.J. Saltiel A.R. Buxbaum J.D. Czernik A.J. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We therefore assessed which, if any, of these kinases is involved in mediating the action of NSAIDs on sAPPα release using specific signaling inhibitors (Fig.6). Initially, we tested the role of PKC in Nim- or Thal-induced sAPPα secretion by using the PKC inhibitors, GF109203X, and calphostin C. GF109203X (2.5 μm) and calphostin (1 μm) partially inhibited sAPPα secretion induced by 1 μm Nim (Fig. 6A), whereas they abolished almost completely Thal-induced sAPPα secretion (Fig. 6B). As shown previously, 1 μm Nim or Thal significantly increased sAPPα release of sAPPα. To examine the possibility that the MAPK-dependent pathway may also be involved in Nim- and Thal-induced sAPPα secretion, we tested the effect of U0126, an inhibitor of MEK, which activates Erk kinase signaling. As shown in Fig. 6, inhibition of MEK by U0126 (5 μm) inhibited Nim-stimulated sAPPα secretion (35%) and significantly blocked (67%) the release of sAPPα, induced by Thal. These findings indicate that PKC- and MAPK-dependent pathways are involved in both Nim and Thal stimulation of sAPPα secretion. To investigate further the observation that NSAID-induced release of sAPPα was mediated by the MAPK pathway, we examined whether the NSAIDs stimulate the MAPK cascade. In results complementary to the inhibitor studies, we found that all of the NSAIDs examined in this study activated the Erk MAPK signaling cascade. Dual phosphorylation of Erk/MAPK on the threonine and tyrosine residues necessary for activation was evaluated using the anti-active MAPK antibody, which has been developed to correlate Erk1/2 MAPK activation with its phosphorylation state (47White M.A. Vale T. Camonis J.H. Schaefer E. Wigler M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16439-16442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Based on immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-p44/p42, Nim dose dependently (1–100 μm) induced Erk phosphorylation in both PC12 cells (Fig.7A and Table II) and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 7B) but had no effect on total levels of the Erk proteins. As seen in Fig, 7C, Nim activated Erk in a time-dependent manner with peak Erk phosphorylation occurring after 15 min of stimulation (Fig. 7C). After 30 and 60 min, MAPK activation decreased and returned to basal levels (data not shown). To determine the inhibitory potential of noncompetitive inhibitors of MEK phosphorylation and activation, the effect of PD98059 and U0126 (48Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R.

Pretreatment with PD98059 or U0126 blocked the Nim-induced increase of Erk1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 7D). We also examined the role of the PKC signaling pathway in Nim-stimulated Erk activation by using the specific PKC inhibitor, GF109203X. Preincubation with GF109203X abolished the response to PMA and decreased the effect of Nim on Erk activation (Fig. 7E).Table IIActivation of MAPK by Nim and ThalDrugConcentration% of controlμmNim1131.6 ± 10.4* 10238.3 ± 3.8***100380.2 ± 5.1***Thal1155.6 ± 12.6** 10211.7 ± 6.5***100247.5 ± 10.0*** Open table in a new tab A similar time- and concentration-dependent increase in MAPK phosphorylation was observed by Ibu and Indo (Fig.8). Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 9, exposure of PC12 cells to Thal and Sup also resulted in an increase in phosphorylated Erk1/2 with no change in total Erk1/2 level. Following the addition of Thal or Sup, Erk1/2 phosphorylation occurred within 15 min, and the effect was concentration-dependent in the range of 1–100 μm (Table II). Both Thal and Sup activated MAPK rapidly and transiently with peak MAPK phosphorylation occurring with 15 min of stimulation (Fig. 9A, part II, and B, part II). To examine the possibility that the activation of MAPK by Thal is caused by the action of MEK, PD98059 was added to the cell cultures. In the presence of 100 μmThal, MAPK phosphorylation again increased within 15 min of Thal treatment, whereas PD98059 blocked Thal-induced Erk phosphorylation (Fig. 9A, part III). The effect of Thal on MAPK phosphorylation was also decreased by GF109203X (Fig. 9A, part III), suggesting a partial involvement of PKC in Thal-induced MAPK activation.FIG. 9The activation of MAPK by Thal and Sup. PC12 cells were incubated with various concentrations of Thal (A, part I) or Sup (B, part I) for 15 min or stimulated with 100 μm Thal (A, part II) or 10 μm Sup (B, part II) for various time intervals. Cells were preincubated for 15 min with vehicle alone or with 30 μm PD98059 or 2.5 μm GF109203X and then incubated without or with 100 μm Thal for 15 min (A, part III).

Since insights into the regulation of APP processing are thought to be crucial in understanding the pathogenesis of AD, we have investigated the action of anti-inflammatory drugs in APP processing and examined the signaling pathways that may mediate their effect. Our data demonstrate that various anti-inflammatory drugs, such as the COX inhibitors Nim, Ibu, or Indo, as well as Thal and its analogue Sup, can modulate the secretion of the non-amyloidogenic α-secretase form (sAPPα) into the conditioned media of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and PC12 cells. Increased sAPPα release, induced by these drugs, was detected by both the monoclonal antibody 22C11, which binds to the N-terminal region of the APP molecule, and the monoclonal antibody 6E10, which recognizes the N-terminal amino acids 1–16 of the β-amyloid fragment of the APP molecule. Since α-secretase cleavage of APP occurs at amino acid 16 within the β-amyloid sequence, this antibody selectively detects the α-secreted APP molecule, suggesting that the"

Thrombo-occlusive events with significant morbidity and mortality include pulmonary and peripheral thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, sepsis, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (1Libby P.

Thrombin possesses intrinsic procoagulant (fibrinogen clotting and platelet aggregation) and anticoagulant (activation of protein C) activities (3Griffin J.H. Nature. 1995; 378: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Continuous infusion of low dose wild-type human thrombin (WT)1 has previously been shown to be a relatively safe antithrombotic agent in baboons (4Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) capable of binding to thrombomodulin and generating endogenous activated protein C (APC), a naturally circulating anticoagulant enzyme (5Esmon C.T.

However, infusion of WT produces some fibrin formation and platelet activation, effects that would be enhanced at higher doses or in regions where WT might be concentrated locally. To fully exploit thrombin as an anticoagulant, its ability to cleave fibrinogen and to activate platelets must be selectively compromised (6Di Cera E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Toward this end, several thrombin mutants have been engineered to significantly tip the balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant activities in favor of protein C activation (6Di Cera E. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1998; 8: 340-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Gibbs C.S. Coutre S.E. Tsiang M., Li, W.X. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Law V.S. Mao C.T. Matsumura S.Y. Mejza S.J.

Nature. 1995; 378: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), no information regarding their antithrombotic potential has been available. Accordingly we tested in a baboon model the effectiveness and safety of the most potent anticoagulant thrombin produced to date, the mutant WE, which was rationally engineered to be practically devoid of activity toward fibrinogen and the platelet receptor PAR1 but to retain the ability of thrombin to activate protein C in the presence of thrombomodulin (9Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). WT and WE were expressed, purified, and characterized in detail as described previously (9Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). WT and WE were stored in frozen aliquots until use in thrombosis or coagulation experiments. To confirm that injection of WE would be at least as safe as injection of WT in baboons, we compared the procoagulant activities of the two thrombins in baboon plasma prepared by pooling citrated plasma samples from five animals. All primate experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Emory University. Since plasma-derived and recombinant human APC have previously been shown to be comparably anticoagulant in human and baboon plasma and both were antithrombotic in baboons (10Gruber A. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Hanson S.R. Blood. 1989; 73: 639-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Taylor F.B. Chang A. Esmon C.T. D'Angelo A. Vigano-D'Angelo S. Blick K.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 79: 918-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), in this study we used an injectable formulation of lyophilized human plasma-derived APC (a gift from the American Red Cross) as positive control for WE. The anticoagulant activity of APC was tested prior to administration by measuring its effect on the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of citrated plasma. At least nine consecutive experiments were performed in each study subject on separate days with at least daily intervals between experiments. The antithrombotic effects of both APC and WE were tested at three dose levels in three awake juvenile baboons weighing 9.4–10.8 kg. Intravenous bolus injections of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.45 mg/kg (1.8, 3.6, or 8 nmol/kg) APC or 0.011, 0.022, or 0.055 mg/kg (0.3, 0.6, or 1.5 nmol/kg) WE in 10 ml of sterile solution containing 2.5% dextrose and 0.45% saline were given to each study subject at time 0. The theoretical peak concentrations of the enzymes in circulating blood were in the range of 30–80 nm (1.7–7.5 μg/ml) for APC and 1.95–40 nm (0.18–3.67 μg/ml) for WE. Ten minutes after the WE or APC bolus, a thrombogenic device was inserted into a chronic exteriorized arteriovenous (AV) shunt. Thrombosis was assessed by γ camera imaging of111indium-labeled platelets prepared and monitored for deposition as described previously (4Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as follows. The thrombogenic device was a 120-cm-long, 3-mm-internal-diameter silicon rubber shunt containing a highly thrombogenic 2-cm-long, 4-mm-internal-diameter knitted Dacron vascular graft that served to initiate and localize thrombus formation. The blood flow rate through the shunt was maintained at 40–50 ml/min by clamping the proximal section of the shunt. The radioactivity of a 45-cm-long middle section of the device also containing the short Dacron segment in a central position was measured continuously by γ camera imaging with data acquisition at consecutive intervals between 10 and 70 min. Since no measurable thrombus formed during the first 5 min of blood exposure, the first 5-min image was taken as background. Radioactivity above background in subsequent measurements indicated local deposition of radiolabeled platelets and the presence of platelet-rich thrombi. The number of deposited platelets was calculated from the radioactivities of the device, the radioactivity of a peripheral 3-ml blood sample, and the platelet count (4Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The device was removed 70 min after APC or WE dosing, and the Dacron segment was saved for determination of fibrin deposition by125iodine-fibrinogen/fibrin counting after allowing at least 30 days for 111indium decay as described previously (4Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After each thrombosis study, blood flow was restored by reconnecting the segments of the chronic shunt using 2-cm-long Teflon tubing connectors (3.0-mm inner diameter). Up to three control studies without antithrombotic treatment were also performed in each animal. The antithrombotic effect of APC or WE treatment was assessed as the reduction in deposited platelets and/or fibrinogenversus untreated controls over the blood exposure period. Platelet deposition results were evaluated using regression analysis with a single dependent variable (platelet deposition) and time, animal, therapy, and dosage as independent predictors. The regression analysis was also used to evaluate dose-response relationships. The antihemostatic effects of the antithrombotic enzymes were assessed following injection of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.45 mg/kg (1.8, 3.6, or 8 nmol/kg) APC or 0.011, 0.022, 0.055, 0.11, or 0.22 mg/kg (0.3, 0.6, 1.5, 3, or 6 nmol/kg) WE. Blood was drawn from the AV shunt or by standard venipuncture in animals without shunts (i.e. the high dose WE studies). The total volume of blood drawn for all in vitro measurements was less than 10 ml/day in each study subject. Blood samples (0.45 or 0.9 ml) were drawn into 3.2% trisodium citrate at regular intervals for at least 100 min after dosing for immediate assessment of APTT by using a coagulometer (Bayer, Inc.). Because APC is progressively inhibited in blood (12Heeb M.J. Gruber A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17606-17612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), samples were processed rapidly, and all APTT measurements were performed between 5 and 7 min following blood drawing to allow for comparisons. As an additional measure of hemostasis, template bleeding times on each study subject were also determined using pediatric devices (Simplate) as described previously (4Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) with values taken 10 min before and 40 min after dosing in each animal. The awake animals were carefully monitored for clinical signs of bleeding or disseminated intravascular coagulation. Normalization of the APTT was confirmed after 24 h in all study subjects. Changes in study parameters due to treatment were analyzed using the paired t test (two-tailed) for predosingversus postdosing parameters. The systemic prothrombotic effect of the device and/or test agents were assessed indirectly by measuring the following: 1) clottable plasma fibrinogen levels in citrated plasma samples from all animals with thrombogenic devices using the von Clauss method (thrombin clotting time of diluted plasma, averages of duplicate measurements) and 2) whole blood platelet counts taken from EDTA-anticoagulated blood samples (single measurements) using an automated blood analyzer. Samples were drawn before and 70 min after injection of the enzymes. A decrease in circulating platelet count or fibrinogen level during an experiment indicated consumption of these factors during thrombus formation. Plasma protein C activity was determined using the snake venom protein C activator Protac in samples drawn before and 100 min after WE or APC administration as described previously (4Hanson S.R.

All citrated baboon plasma samples for protein C testing were incubated at room temperature for 48 h prior to performing the protein C test to allow for normalization of APTT values. In each case, normalization of APTT to within 10 s of the APTT value in the corresponding base-line sample was confirmed prior to protein C testing. Pooled normal baboon plasma, also incubated for 48 h, was diluted 1:1 in protein C-depleted human plasma (George King Bio-Medical, Overland Park, KS) and then in serial dilutions to generate a protein C activity standard curve. The baboon samples were diluted 1:3 with protein C-depleted human plasma. Lyophilized Protac C vials were reconstituted into a 3-ml volume as recommended (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT), and 40 μl of the activator was incubated with 20 μl of the 1:3 diluted baboon sample at 37 °C for 1 min before adding a 30-μl aliquot of the mixture to the APTT card. The protein C activity of the sample was expressed as a percentage of the normal value using the standard curve generated using pooled baboon plasma. Prior to thrombin administration in vivo, APC was shown to anticoagulate baboon and human plasma, producing comparable prolongation of the APTT in both cases (data not shown). WE was at least 6000-fold less procoagulant than WT in baboon plasma (data not shown). It was thus determined that either agent could be safely administered to baboons. The antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects of escalating doses of WE and exogenous APC were determined in baboons. Thrombosis was assessed by γ camera imaging of111indium-labeled platelet deposition following placement of a thrombogenic Dacron graft segment into a femoral AV shunt. In the three control experiments, total thrombus platelet deposition averaged 17.9 ± 5.7 × 109 platelets after 60 min of blood exposure. Both WE and high dose APC inhibited thrombosis as shown by the decrease in platelet deposition versus the results obtained in the corresponding untreated control animals (Fig.1). At 70 min, the highest dose of WE, 0.055 mg/kg, reduced platelet deposition by 82%, and this reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The lower doses of WE, 0.022 and 0.011 mg/kg, reduced platelet thrombus formation by 77% (p < 0.001) and 80% (p < 0.01), respectively. Similarly, as shown in Fig. 1, the highest dose of APC, 0.45 mg/kg, reduced thrombus formation by 71% (p< 0.001), while the lower doses of APC, 2.0 and 1.0 mg/kg, were less effective and reduced platelet deposition by 32% (p = 0.078) and 49% (p < 0.01), respectively. The differences between the lower doses of either WE or APC were not statistically significant for dose response. Concordant with these findings, platelet count and fibrinogen levels decreased moderately due to thrombus formation in untreated controls but not in WE-treated or APC-treated animals (TableI).Table IChanges in platelet count, fibrinogen level, protein C level, and bleeding time following no treatment (control) or treatment with three different doses of APC and five different doses of WE in baboonsAgent (dose in mg/kg)WE (0.22)WE (0.11)WE (0.055)WE (0.022)WE (0.011)APC (0.45)APC (0.2)APC (0.1)Control (0)Thrombus (+, yes; −, no)−− + ++++++Change in platelet count (0 vs. 70 min) (%)1-aGiven as the average percent changes in three study subjects; duplicate original measurements where applicable.ND1-bNot determined because these samples were not collected.ND1-bNot determined because these samples were not collected.−1.6 ± 3.61.2 ± 4.23.1 ± 3.5−3.3 ± 1.81.6 ± 2.6−6.5 ± 4.8−13.3 ± 1.3 p 1-cProbability of difference (p value) between measured values “pre” and “post” treatment was determined using the t test (paired, two-tailed). 0.634 0.9020.4680.2510.4810.296<0.001Change in fibrinogen level (0 vs. 70 min) (%)1-aGiven as the average percent changes in three study subjects; duplicate original measurements where applicable.ND1-bNot determined because these samples were not collected.ND1-bNot determined because these samples were not collected.3.2 ± 2.9−0.5 ± 2.7−1.8 ± 1.62.7 ± 0.2−2.2 ± 2.7−5.9 ± 1.9−10.5 ± 1.3 p 1-cProbability of difference (p value) between measured values “pre” and “post” treatment was determined using the t test (paired, two-tailed). 0.382 0.9380.3160.0570.5070.1630.012Change of protein C level (0 vs. 100 min) (%; mean ± S.E.)1-aGiven as the average percent changes in three study subjects; duplicate original measurements where applicable.−63.1 ± 3.9−43.7 ± 4.5−23.6 ± 2.8−16.2 ± 1.7−8.1 ± 0.72.4 ± 0.82.8 ± 0.21.5 ± 3.6−0.5 ± 1.8 p 1-cProbability of difference (p value) between measured values “pre” and “post” treatment was determined using the t test (paired, two-tailed).0.0140.020 0.029 0.0250.0020.072NA1-dNot applicable.0.7610.789Change in bleeding time (0 vs. 40 min) (%)1-aGiven as the average percent changes in three study subjects; duplicate original measurements where applicable.114.7 ± 26.638.3 ± 5.16.6 ± 7.86.5 ± 6.819.8 ± 20.155.7 ± 22.614.9 ± 13.67.7 ± 12.2−0.2 ± 7.2 p 1-cProbability of difference (p value) between measured values “pre” and “post” treatment was determined using the t test (paired, two-tailed).0.0680.099 0.350 0.6660.3970.0470.3460.7070.8071-a Given as the average percent changes in three study subjects; duplicate original measurements where applicable.1-b Not determined because these samples were not collected.1-c Probability of difference (p value) between measured values “pre” and “post” treatment was determined using the t test (paired, two-tailed).1-d Not applicable. Open table in a new tab At the end of the thrombosis experiments, fibrin deposition averaged 1.9 ± 0.07 mg in the control studies (Fig.2). This value was not significantly reduced by infusion of APC at doses of 0.45 mg/kg (1.8 ± 0.3 mg,p > 0.5), 0.2 mg/kg (1.7 ± 0.2 mg,p > 0.5), or 0.1 mg/kg (2.0 ± 0.3 mg,p > 0.5). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2, WE reduced fibrin accumulation at doses of 0.055 mg/kg (0.9 ± 0.1 mg,p < 0.05), 0.022 mg/kg (1.3 ± 0.2 mg,p < 0.05), or 0.011 mg/kg (1.2 ± 0.1 mg,p < 0.05). Pretreatment template bleeding time averaged 4.6 ± 0.3 min. The highest dose of APC modestly increased the template bleeding time, but all bleeding times remained below 10 min in each group (TableI). Both WE and APC treatments compromised coagulation-dependent hemostasis at all doses administered as reflected by significant systemic anticoagulation within 10 min after dosing (Fig. 3). After the observation period of 100 min, APTT values had returned to pretreatment base-line levels in animals treated with APC (p > 0.8 for each dose group) but remained prolonged in animals treated with WE at doses of 0.022 mg/kg and greater (p < 0.03 for each dose group). The prolongation of APTT at 10 and 40 min after injection of WE was positively correlated with the dose administered (r 2 = 0.89 at the 10-min time point, andr 2 = 0.93 at the 40-min time point). The APTT prolongation after bolus APC was also dose-dependent. During incubation of citrated blood samples, the anticoagulant effects of the treatments diminished over time due to progressive inhibition of APC by plasma inhibitors (12Heeb M.J. Gruber A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17606-17612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and APTT values approached those of the predosing samples. Clotting times normalized at comparable rates in samples taken from either APC- or WE-treated animals (Fig.4). Although injection of either WE or APC resulted in prolongation of the APTT up to 10-foldversus the base-line value, no clinically obvious signs of bleeding or procoagulant activity were detected in any of the animals. Plasma protein C activity was reduced following injection of all doses of WE (Table I). There was a positive correlation between loss of protein C activity and the dose of WE (r 2 = 0.97). Plasma samples that were taken from WE-treated animals and incubated for 48 h at room temperature contained no clots. All 10- and 40-min plasma samples from experiments with animals given WE at doses of 0.11 or 0.22 mg/kg, but not from animals dosed with WE at 0.055 mg/kg or with APC, contained loose plasma clots after incubation for 1 week, consistent with predictions from in vitrostudies (9Cantwell A.M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39827-39830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Most agents that exhibit antithrombotic effects, including APC, compromise blood coagulation and platelet-dependent hemostasis to some degree. This was confirmed in the present study since both APC and WE prolonged the APTT. Since the prolonged APTT of samples taken from WE-treated and APC-treated animals was found to progressively and comparably decrease during incubation, the observed anticoagulant effects can be attributed to the presence of circulating APC. The systemic anticoagulant response to all doses of WE persisted longer than the response to exogenous APC in the present study, or the response to WT in a previous baboon study (4Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting more persistent maintenance of circulating APC levels by WE. The laboratory diagnosis of ongoing thrombosis or disseminated intravascular coagulation is suggested by an acute decrease in circulating fibrinogen and/or platelets. Interestingly all doses of WE prevented circulating fibrinogen and platelet consumption, notwithstanding the procoagulant stimulus provided by placement of thrombogenic devices within an ex vivo circuit. Thus, unlike higher doses of WT (4Hanson S.R. Griffin J.H. Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Esmon C.T. Gruber A. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 92: 2003-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), WE activates the endogenous protein C pathway without producing clinically relevant procoagulant (fibrinogen consumption) or prothrombotic (platelet consumption) effects. This finding confirms that the WE mutant exhibits minimal procoagulant activity in vivo. The dynamics and time course of arterial-type thrombus formation in this standardized baboon model are similar to events following the rupture of a coronary plaque (14Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Hanson S.R. Circulation. 1991; 83: 41-55Google Scholar). A significant percentage of untreated graft devices occlude within 1–2 h, and the pharmacological inhibition of graft thrombus formation and occlusion, comparable to that produced in the present study with WE, usually requires relatively large doses of antithrombotic agents like antithrombins (14Harker L.A. Kelly A.B. Hanson S.R. Circulation. 1991; 83: 41-55Google Scholar) and inhibitors of the platelet fibrinogen receptor (15Hanson S.R. Pareti F.I. Ruggeri Z.M. Marzec U.M. Kunicki T.J. Montgomery R.R. Zimmerman T.S. Harker L.A. J. Clin. Investig. 1988; 81: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), which may produce increased bleeding. It was therefore remarkable that administration of the lowest dose of WE resulted in a profound and persistent antithrombotic effect that was accompanied by only modest impairment of coagulation and hemostasis. WE produced a near maximum effect at all doses tested, and no apparent dose-response relationship was found over doses ranging from 0.011 to 0.055 mg/kg, suggesting that the minimum efficacious dose of WE could be much lower than the 0.011 mg/kg dose evaluated in the present thrombosis model. Importantly the lowest dose of WE (0.011 mg/kg) appeared to be equi-efficacious with the highest dose of APC (0.45 mg/kg) since at these doses both agents potently and comparably inhibited platelet deposition. Inhibition of fibrin deposition by APC could not be confirmed probably because anticoagulation by exogenous APC was less persistent than that of WE throughout the 60-min interval of fibrin formation. Whereas administration of APC had no effect on plasma protein C activity, a significant fraction of circulating protein C was consumed following injection of high dose WE resulting in partial protein C depletion. Based on the observed dramatic anticoagulant effects of endogenous APC produced following high dose WE, we suggest that activation of the endogenous protein C pool has the capacity for sustained antithrombotic as well as anticoagulant activity. Indeed it is possible that a significant proportion of the circulating protein C pool could be chronically activated by pharmacological doses of WE provided there is a sufficient endogenous or exogenous supply of protein C and thrombomodulin. Thus, a stable protein C activator such as WE could eventually achieve sustained pharmacological activation of the protein C pool for the treatment of thrombotic disorders that respond to APC."

All four NDST 5′-UTR sequences are unusually long, have a high degree of predicted secondary structure, and contain multiple upstream AUG codons, which together impose a major barrier to conventional, cap-dependent ribosomal scanning. At least two alternatively spliced forms of NDST2 differing in their 5′-UTRs exist, and two forms of NDST4 arise from alternative transcriptional start sites. The 5′-UTRs do not show any significant sequence similarity between isozymes, but possess highly conserved regions between mouse and human orthologs, pointing toward evolutionarily conserved functions. Expression of bicistronic vector constructs showed that the 5′-UTRs of NDST1–4 are capable of regulating translation differentially in vivo dependent on cell type and culture conditions. In vitro translation of a reporter gene located downstream of the UTRs demonstrated the presence of internal ribosome entry sites, providing an additional, cap-independent step in fine-tuning NDST expression. Comparative studies of NDST1–3 mRNAs and protein expression in brain and embryonic extracts revealed striking differences in translational efficiency. Other genes necessary for glycosaminoglycan synthesis in addition to the NDST isozymes have long, structured 5′-UTRs. Because several growth factors and morphogens that bind heparan sulfate also contain structured 5′-UTRs, translational regulation may coordinate the action of these factors and their heparan sulfate co-receptors.

Four isozymes exist in vertebrates, whereas only one is expressed inDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The importance of NDST1 in normal physiology in mice has been established by targeted disruption of the gene, which results in embryonic and neonatal lethality due to multiple organ defects (8Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. Van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellén L. Forsberg E. J. Biol.

In contrast, disruption of NDST2 affects only connective tissue-type mast cells, resulting in a storage deficiency for proteases and histamine due to lack of heparin (10Forsberg E. Pejler G.

The function of NDST3 and NDST4 are not yet established. As NDST1 and NDST2 show ubiquitous mRNA expression (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the strikingly different phenotypes of the mutants point toward other modes of enzyme regulation, possibly at the post-transcriptional or post-translational level.The leader sequences of most mRNAs are usually short (50–70 nucleotides), contain 5′-m7G cap structures, and lack highly organized secondary structures (12Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 13Cazzola M. Skoda R.C.

These features are compatible with efficient translation by the ribosomal scanning mechanism, which is considered valid for the majority of cellular and viral mRNAs (15Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 16Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Translational control of these transcripts is most commonly exerted at the rate-limiting initiation phase. The 5′-cap structure (m7GpppN) attracts the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex, composed of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA-dependent ATPase (helicase) eIF4A, and the modular factor eIF4G. The small (40 S) ribosomal subunit binds to the 5′-end of the RNA·eIF4F complex along with eIF3 and the ternary complex of eIF2, GTP, and Met-tRNAi. The resulting 48 S complex then advances through the initiation cycle, resulting in lateral movement of the 43 S unit along the mRNA (scanning), usually to the first AUG triplet, which serves as the initiation codon. Upon dissociation of initiation factors, the large (60 S) subunit joins to form the 80 S ribosome. The eIF4E-eIF4G interaction with RNA is a limited controlled process, reduced by hypophosphorylation of eIF4E or the competitive inhibitors (eIF4E-binding proteins) or by phosphorylation of eIF2 (17Sonenberg N. Newgard C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Rapid amplification of the 5′-ends of murine and human NDST cDNAs (5′-RACE) revealed long, structured, and AUG-rich 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs). These types of UTRs are incompatible with the described scanning mode for translation initiation due to secondary structure constraints and abortive initiation at upstream AUG codons (uAUGs) located 5′ to the actual initiation site for translation. Complex 5′-UTRs are found in ∼10% of mRNAs, often in those encoding regulatory proteins such as proto-oncogenes (18Willis A.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), growth factors (insulin-like growth factor II, platelet-derived growth factor 2, transforming growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor) and their receptors, and homeodomain proteins (14van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In some of these cases, initiation is driven from internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) that allow for cap-independent translation, thus affording another level of control over protein expression. Specific sulfated sugar sequences in cell-surface heparan sulfate can bind to many of these growth factors and facilitate signaling (19Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, cap-independent translational regulation of NDST expression and the growth factors may be coordinated to fine-tune growth responses in target cells. Here, we report the comparison of the 5′-UTRs of the NDSTs, their regulatory properties with respect to translation, and the presence of complex UTRs in other enzymes involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Our findings suggest the possibility of coordinated translational control over several components of growth factor signaling pathways.DISCUSSIONNDST1–4 are important enzymes in the formation of heparan sulfate because all other modifications of the chains (O-sulfation and epimerization of uronic acids) depend on the conversion of GlcNAc to GlcNSO3 residues (27Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 28Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The four isozymes have different biochemical properties that manifest as variation in substrate preference and relative activity (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The four isozymes are also differentially expressed in tissues, based on PCR analysis or Northern blots of mRNA (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the expression pattern of the NDST isozymes may also reflect differential translation in tissues dependent on their 5′-UTRs. The evidence is based on (i) the length and complexity of the 5′-UTRs from mice and human homologs, (ii) differential expression of reporter constructs in which the 5′-UTRs were ligated to EGFP, (iii) mutational analysis, (iv) the effects of serum and rapamycin on translation, and (v) differences in NDST protein expression relative to mRNA in brain and embryonic extracts. These findings demonstrate an important caveat in interpreting levels of enzyme expression from NDST mRNA levels. The data suggest that the level of enzyme activity contributed by the various isoforms will depend on both transcription and translation.The presence of regulatory elements in the 5′-UTRs of the NDSTs may explain some of the surprising results obtained in genetic studies of mice in which individual NDSTs have been inactivated (29Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). NDST1 and NDST2 mRNAs are abundantly expressed in nearly all tissues (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and both enzymes can participate in heparan sulfate formation (6Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Ishihara M. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Guo Y. Swiedler S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Inactivation of NDST1 has a profound effect on development (8Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. Van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellén L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 9Fan G. Xiao L. Cheng L. Wang X. Sun B. Hu G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting a prominent role for this enzyme in many tissues. The restricted phenotype of NDST2 is surprising, however, given the widespread expression of its mRNA. The data presented here suggest that NDST2 enzyme expression may not occur even though abundant message is present. The lack of phenotype in those tissues containing both enzymes suggests that the two activities may be redundant in certain contexts.Having 5′-UTR sequences with embedded IRES motifs allows cells to regulate the level of translation, which is especially relevant for regulatory factors. One of the best studied systems involves cellular iron homeostasis, which is regulated by translational control of the transferrin receptor and ferritin expression (31Muckenthaler M. Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins that bind iron (iron regulatory proteins) interact with specific stem-loop structures (iron response elements) in the 5′-UTRs of the corresponding mRNAs, thus regulating expression of the genes according to the iron status of the cytosol. Whether similar stem-loop structures and regulatory proteins exist for the UTRs of the NDSTs awaits further analysis.Interestingly, the cell type-specific translational regulation of NDST isozymes strongly resembles the pattern of regulation of growth factors, some of which bind heparan sulfate in a sulfation-dependent manner. For example, tissue-specific regulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 translation appears to be dependent on its 5′-UTR (32Creancier L. Morello D. Mercier P. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly, vascular endothelial growth factor regulation by hypoxia (33Stein I. Itin A. Einat P. Skaliter R. Grossman Z.

The 5′-UTRs of these and other growth factors are often long, have high folding energies, contain uAUGs, and are often equipped with an IRES, which together can contribute to precise expression levels during growth and differentiation (14van der Velden A.W.

The fact that many of these growth factors also bind heparan sulfate suggests the possibility of coordinate regulation of the growth factors and their heparan sulfate co-receptors.A survey of other enzymes involved in heparan sulfate formation indicates that 5′-UTR-dependent regulation may extend to other biosynthetic steps (Table III). Although clones containing the coding sequence for nearly all of the genes are now available (28Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), only a few have published sequences that extend significantly into the 5′-UTRs. Notably, the available sequence for EXT1 and EXT2, which make up the copolymerase responsible for the formation of the polysaccharide backbone (35Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), contains an extended 5′-UTR sequence with high folding energy and numerous uAUGs. These genes are thought to be tumor suppressors based on the loss of heterozygosity in chondrosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (36Hecht J.T. Hogue D. Strong L.C. Hansen M.F. Blanton S.H.

Four isozymes exist in vertebrates, whereas only one is expressed inDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. The importance of NDST1 in normal physiology in mice has been established by targeted disruption of the gene, which results in embryonic and neonatal lethality due to multiple organ defects (8Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. Van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellén L. Forsberg E. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of NDST2 affects only connective tissue-type mast cells, resulting in a storage deficiency for proteases and histamine due to lack of heparin (10Forsberg E. Pejler G. Ringvall M. Lunderius C. Tomasini-Johansson B. Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Ledin J. Hellman L. Kjellén L. Nature. 1999; 400: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 11Humphries D.E.

The function of NDST3 and NDST4 are not yet established. As NDST1 and NDST2 show ubiquitous mRNA expression (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), the strikingly different phenotypes of the mutants point toward other modes of enzyme regulation, possibly at the post-transcriptional or post-translational level. The leader sequences of most mRNAs are usually short (50–70 nucleotides), contain 5′-m7G cap structures, and lack highly organized secondary structures (12Gray N.K. Wickens M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 399-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 13Cazzola M. Skoda R.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3280-3288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). These features are compatible with efficient translation by the ribosomal scanning mechanism, which is considered valid for the majority of cellular and viral mRNAs (15Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar, 16Pestova T.V. Kolupaeva V.G. Lomakin I.B. Pilipenko E.V. Shatsky I.N. Agol V.I. Hellen C.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7029-7036Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Translational control of these transcripts is most commonly exerted at the rate-limiting initiation phase. The 5′-cap structure (m7GpppN) attracts the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex, composed of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the RNA-dependent ATPase (helicase) eIF4A, and the modular factor eIF4G. The small (40 S) ribosomal subunit binds to the 5′-end of the RNA·eIF4F complex along with eIF3 and the ternary complex of eIF2, GTP, and Met-tRNAi. The resulting 48 S complex then advances through the initiation cycle, resulting in lateral movement of the 43 S unit along the mRNA (scanning), usually to the first AUG triplet, which serves as the initiation codon. Upon dissociation of initiation factors, the large (60 S) subunit joins to form the 80 S ribosome. The eIF4E-eIF4G interaction with RNA is a limited controlled process, reduced by hypophosphorylation of eIF4E or the competitive inhibitors (eIF4E-binding proteins) or by phosphorylation of eIF2 (17Sonenberg N. Newgard C.B. Science. 2001; 293: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Rapid amplification of the 5′-ends of murine and human NDST cDNAs (5′-RACE) revealed long, structured, and AUG-rich 5′-untranslated regions (5′-UTRs). These types of UTRs are incompatible with the described scanning mode for translation initiation due to secondary structure constraints and abortive initiation at upstream AUG codons (uAUGs) located 5′ to the actual initiation site for translation. Complex 5′-UTRs are found in ∼10% of mRNAs, often in those encoding regulatory proteins such as proto-oncogenes (18Willis A.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), growth factors (insulin-like growth factor II, platelet-derived growth factor 2, transforming growth factor-β, fibroblast growth factor 2, and vascular endothelial growth factor) and their receptors, and homeodomain proteins (14van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In some of these cases, initiation is driven from internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) that allow for cap-independent translation, thus affording another level of control over protein expression. Specific sulfated sugar sequences in cell-surface heparan sulfate can bind to many of these growth factors and facilitate signaling (19Park P.W. Reizes O. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29923-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Thus, cap-independent translational regulation of NDST expression and the growth factors may be coordinated to fine-tune growth responses in target cells. Here, we report the comparison of the 5′-UTRs of the NDSTs, their regulatory properties with respect to translation, and the presence of complex UTRs in other enzymes involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Our findings suggest the possibility of coordinated translational control over several components of growth factor signaling pathways. DISCUSSIONNDST1–4 are important enzymes in the formation of heparan sulfate because all other modifications of the chains (O-sulfation and epimerization of uronic acids) depend on the conversion of GlcNAc to GlcNSO3 residues (27Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 28Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The four isozymes have different biochemical properties that manifest as variation in substrate preference and relative activity (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The four isozymes are also differentially expressed in tissues, based on PCR analysis or Northern blots of mRNA (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the expression pattern of the NDST isozymes may also reflect differential translation in tissues dependent on their 5′-UTRs. The evidence is based on (i) the length and complexity of the 5′-UTRs from mice and human homologs, (ii) differential expression of reporter constructs in which the 5′-UTRs were ligated to EGFP, (iii) mutational analysis, (iv) the effects of serum and rapamycin on translation, and (v) differences in NDST protein expression relative to mRNA in brain and embryonic extracts. These findings demonstrate an important caveat in interpreting levels of enzyme expression from NDST mRNA levels. The data suggest that the level of enzyme activity contributed by the various isoforms will depend on both transcription and translation.The presence of regulatory elements in the 5′-UTRs of the NDSTs may explain some of the surprising results obtained in genetic studies of mice in which individual NDSTs have been inactivated (29Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). NDST1 and NDST2 mRNAs are abundantly expressed in nearly all tissues (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and both enzymes can participate in heparan sulfate formation (6Aikawa J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Ishihara M. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Guo Y. Swiedler S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Inactivation of NDST1 has a profound effect on development (8Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. Van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F. Eriksson I. Olofsson A.M. Kjellén L. Forsberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25926-25930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 9Fan G. Xiao L. Cheng L. Wang X. Sun B. Hu G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting a prominent role for this enzyme in many tissues. The restricted phenotype of NDST2 is surprising, however, given the widespread expression of its mRNA. The data presented here suggest that NDST2 enzyme expression may not occur even though abundant message is present. The lack of phenotype in those tissues containing both enzymes suggests that the two activities may be redundant in certain contexts.Having 5′-UTR sequences with embedded IRES motifs allows cells to regulate the level of translation, which is especially relevant for regulatory factors. One of the best studied systems involves cellular iron homeostasis, which is regulated by translational control of the transferrin receptor and ferritin expression (31Muckenthaler M. Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins that bind iron (iron regulatory proteins) interact with specific stem-loop structures (iron response elements) in the 5′-UTRs of the corresponding mRNAs, thus regulating expression of the genes according to the iron status of the cytosol.

Keshet E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor 2/c-sis expression that occurs during differentiation (34Bernstein J. Sella O., Le, S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9356-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) are regulated in this way as well.

Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 28Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The four isozymes have different biochemical properties that manifest as variation in substrate preference and relative activity (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The four isozymes are also differentially expressed in tissues, based on PCR analysis or Northern blots of mRNA (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that the expression pattern of the NDST isozymes may also reflect differential translation in tissues dependent on their 5′-UTRs. The evidence is based on (i) the length and complexity of the 5′-UTRs from mice and human homologs, (ii) differential expression of reporter constructs in which the 5′-UTRs were ligated to EGFP, (iii) mutational analysis, (iv) the effects of serum and rapamycin on translation, and (v) differences in NDST protein expression relative to mRNA in brain and embryonic extracts. These findings demonstrate an important caveat in interpreting levels of enzyme expression from NDST mRNA levels. The data suggest that the level of enzyme activity contributed by the various isoforms will depend on both transcription and translation. The presence of regulatory elements in the 5′-UTRs of the NDSTs may explain some of the surprising results obtained in genetic studies of mice in which individual NDSTs have been inactivated (29Grobe K. Ledin J. Ringvall M. Holborn K. Forsberg E. Esko J.D. Kjellen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). NDST1 and NDST2 mRNAs are abundantly expressed in nearly all tissues (7Aikawa J. Grobe K. Tsujimoto M. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5876-5882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 23Kusche-Gullberg M. Eriksson I. Pikas D.S. Kjellén L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2690-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Ishihara M. Kiefer M.C. Barr P.J. Guo Y. Swiedler S.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Inactivation of NDST1 has a profound effect on development (8Ringvall M. Ledin J. Holmborn K. Van Kuppevelt T. Ellin F.

Hu G. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), suggesting a prominent role for this enzyme in many tissues. The restricted phenotype of NDST2 is surprising, however, given the widespread expression of its mRNA. The data presented here suggest that NDST2 enzyme expression may not occur even though abundant message is present. The lack of phenotype in those tissues containing both enzymes suggests that the two activities may be redundant in certain contexts. Having 5′-UTR sequences with embedded IRES motifs allows cells to regulate the level of translation, which is especially relevant for regulatory factors. One of the best studied systems involves cellular iron homeostasis, which is regulated by translational control of the transferrin receptor and ferritin expression (31Muckenthaler M. Gray N.K. Hentze M.W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 383-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic RNA-binding proteins that bind iron (iron regulatory proteins) interact with specific stem-loop structures (iron response elements) in the 5′-UTRs of the corresponding mRNAs, thus regulating expression of the genes according to the iron status of the cytosol. Whether similar stem-loop structures and regulatory proteins exist for the UTRs of the NDSTs awaits further analysis. Interestingly, the cell type-specific translational regulation of NDST isozymes strongly resembles the pattern of regulation of growth factors, some of which bind heparan sulfate in a sulfation-dependent manner. For example, tissue-specific regulation of fibroblast growth factor 2 translation appears to be dependent on its 5′-UTR (32Creancier L. Morello D. Mercier P. Prats A.C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Similarly, vascular endothelial growth factor regulation by hypoxia (33Stein I. Itin A. Einat P. Skaliter R. Grossman Z. Keshet E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3112-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and platelet-derived growth factor 2/c-sis expression that occurs during differentiation (34Bernstein J. Sella O., Le, S.Y. Elroy-Stein O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9356-9362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) are regulated in this way as well. The 5′-UTRs of these and other growth factors are often long, have high folding energies, contain uAUGs, and are often equipped with an IRES, which together can contribute to precise expression levels during growth and differentiation (14van der Velden A.W. Thomas A.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 18Willis A.E. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The fact that many of these growth factors also bind heparan sulfate suggests the possibility of coordinate regulation of the growth factors and their heparan sulfate co-receptors. A survey of other enzymes involved in heparan sulfate formation indicates that 5′-UTR-dependent regulation may extend to other biosynthetic steps (Table III). Although clones containing the coding sequence for nearly all of the genes are now available (28Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), only a few have published sequences that extend significantly into the 5′-UTRs. Notably, the available sequence for EXT1 and EXT2, which make up the copolymerase responsible for the formation of the polysaccharide backbone (35Zak B.M. Crawford B.E. Esko J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), contains an extended 5′-UTR sequence with high folding energy and numerous uAUGs. These genes are thought to be tumor suppressors based on the loss of heterozygosity in chondrosarcomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (36Hecht J.T. Hogue D. Strong L.C. Hansen M.F. Blanton S.H. Wagner M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1995; 56: 1125-1131PubMed Google Scholar,37Piao Z. Kim H. Jeon B.K. Lee W.J. Park C. Cancer (Phila.). 1997; 80: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the glucosamine 3-O-sulfotransferases 1 and 3A also contain complex 5′-UTRs. These genes play pivotal roles in forming the antithrombin binding sequence and binding sites for herpes simplex virus, respectively (38Shworak N.W. Liu J. Fritze L.M.S. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L.J.

The presence of complex 5′-UTRs in mRNAs of various enzymes involved in heparan sulfate biosynthesis suggests that translational control may be exerted at several steps. Translational regulation coupled with transcriptional controls provides a sophisticated way to control the expression of growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting heparan sulfate chains, consistent with the important roles these polysaccharides play in cell biology (19Park P.W.

https://openalex.org/W2060336682,"Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) acts as a potent survival factor in numerous cell lines, primarily through activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Although some targets of this pathway have known anti-apoptotic functions, its relationship with the improved survival of cells after exposure to environmental stresses, including UVB, remains largely unclear. We report that in growth factor-deprived keratinocytes, IGF-1 significantly and consistently delayed the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis by >7 h. This delay allowed IGF-1-supplemented keratinocytes to repair significantly more cyclobutane thymine dimers than their growth factor-deprived counterparts. This increase in cyclobutane thymine removal resulted in enhanced survival if the amount of DNA damage was not too high. To increase cell survival after UVB irradiation, IGF-1 supplementation was required only during this initial time period in which extra repair was executed. Finally, we show that IGF-1 mediated this delay in the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis through activation of the AKT signaling pathway. We therefore believe that the AKT signaling pathway increases cell survival after a genotoxic insult such as UVB irradiation not by inhibiting the apoptotic stimulus, but only by postponing the induction of apoptosis, giving the DNA repair mechanism more time to work.

The UVB fraction (290–320 nm) of terrestrial sunlight is highly carcinogenic (1Brash D.E. Ziegler A. Jonason A.S. Simon J.A. Kunala S. Leffell D.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. Symp. Proc. 1996; 1: 136-142PubMed Google Scholar). UVB photons damage DNA directly, forming specific photolesions, among which cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and pyrimidine-pyrimidone (6-4) photoproducts are most prevalent (2Brash D.E. Rudolph J.A. Simon J.A. Lin A. McKenna G.J. Baden H.P. Halperin A.J. Ponten J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10124-10128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). These lesions give rise to mutations if not efficiently removed by the nucleotide excision repair complex. The response of primary human keratinocytes to UVB irradiation depends highly on the amount of DNA damage. In healthy epidermis, the keratinocyte undergoes cell cycle arrest and repairs its DNA at low UVB doses, whereas high UVB doses lead to apoptosis, which prevents replication of damaged cells and can be seen as the cell’s last escape mechanism. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated energy-dependent process by which the cell triggers its own death. Among the morphological features associated with apoptosis are membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies (3Pourzand C. Tyrrell R.M. Photochem. Photobiol. 1999; 70: 380-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).The threshold of UVB irradiation required to induce apoptosis in human keratinocytes is lowered by growth factor deprivation, and this can be prevented by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) 1The trivial name and abbreviations used are: IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IGF-BP3, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PDK, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase; T3, triiodo-l-thyronine; BPE, bovine pituitary extract; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. 1The trivial name and abbreviations used are: IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor; IGF-BP3, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PDK, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase; T3, triiodo-l-thyronine; BPE, bovine pituitary extract; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Z-VAD-fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. supplementation of the cell culture medium (4Kuhn C.

Elder J.T. Griffiths C.E. Cooper K.D. Talwar H. Fisher G.J. Keane K.M. Foltin S.K. Voorhees J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 99: 343-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). IGF-1 availability to keratinocytes is limited through synthesis of the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGF-BP3), which has been shown to be dependent on p53 transactivation (7Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N. Nature. 1995; 377: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). In skin, IGF-BP3 mRNA localizes to the basal proliferative layer of the epidermis (8Batch J.A. Mercuri F.A. Edmondson S.R. Werther G.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1444-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), further indicating that IGF-1 signaling in skin is a tightly regulated process. Deregulation of this IGF-1 signaling pathway is often a key to the establishment of a transformed phenotype (9Baserga R. Hongo A. Rubini M. Prisco M. Valentinis B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F105-F126Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Consistently, constitutive IGF-1 expression in basal keratinocytes of transgenic mice leads to spontaneous tumor promotion (10DiGiovanni J. Bol D.K. Wilker E. Beltran L. Carbajal S. Moats S.

The proto-oncogene c-akt, encoding a 57-kDa serine/threonine protein kinase, is the cellular homolog of the viral oncogene v-akt (12Bellacosa A. Testa J.R. Staal S.P. Tsichlis P.N. Science. 1991; 254: 274-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar).

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar).The mechanism by which IGF-1-mediated AKT activation contributes to increased cell survival after exposure to environmental stresses, including UVB, remains largely unclear. In this study, we show that cell survival is enhanced by IGF-1 supplementation only when cells are irradiated with 16–32 mJ/cm2 UVB. However, we show that IGF-1-supplemented cells consistently display a prominent delay in the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis over a broader range of UVB doses compared with their growth factor-deprived counterparts. We demonstrate that, although IGF-1 does not directly inhibit the apoptotic stimulus, this postponement of the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis allows more time for DNA repair, weakening the apoptotic stimulus. This results in increased survival of IGF-1-treated cells when they are exposed to a UVB dose of 16–32 mJ/cm2. Finally, we show that IGF-1 mediates this delay in the onset of apoptosis through activation of the AKT signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism by which IGF-1-mediated AKT activation increases cell survival of keratinocytes after UVB irradiation. It has been shown before that the threshold dose for UVB-induced cell death in human keratinocytes can be increased by IGF-1 supplementation (4Kuhn C. Hurwitz S.A. Kumar M.G. Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We show that IGF-1 supplementation enhances survival of cells only at a small dose range of UVB (16–32 mJ/cm2), whereas it offers no protection against irradiation at higher UVB doses. In this study, we clearly demonstrate that IGF-1 signaling does not directly inhibit the apoptotic process, but, no matter what UVB dose used, consistently postpones the induction of apoptosis for >7 h. We show that the additional cyclobutane thymine dimer removal, executed by the nucleotide excision repair mechanism during this time period, results in the disappearance of the apoptotic stimulus. This results in an increase in cell survival when the DNA damage (and thus the UVB dose) is not too high. This explains why IGF-1-supplemented cells are able to survive somewhat higher UVB doses than growth factor-deprived cells. Finally, we show that this delay in the onset of apoptosis is dependent on the activation of the AKT signaling pathway.IGF-1 was found to enhance survival of keratinocytes after UVB irradiation only at the limited UVB dose range of 16–32 mJ/cm2. IGF-1 did not significantly affect cell survival when cells were irradiated with lower UVB doses, whereas survival after irradiation at higher UVB doses was reduced to zero no matter what culture condition was used. We report that cells grown in complete medium or pretreated with IGF-1 prior to UVB irradiation and irradiated with a lethal dose of 100 mJ/cm2 UVB started to show signs of apoptosis 10 h after UVB irradiation. In contrast to this, growth factor-deprived cells already showed signs of apoptosis 3 h after UVB irradiation. IGF-1 did not protect cells against apoptosis when the cells were irradiated with this lethal UVB dose; nevertheless, a clear postponement of the onset of apoptosis by 7 h was observed in these cells. This difference in time at which apoptosis was induced after UVB irradiation was observed for doses as low as 16 mJ/cm2 UVB, corresponding to the lowest dose at which we observed a significant increase in cell survival for IGF-1-treated cells. This led us to the hypothesis that IGF-1 does not inhibit UVB-induced apoptosis, but merely postpones the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis by >7 h.None of the other growth factors present in the complete medium (EGF, BPE, T3, insulin, and hydrocortisone) were able to delay the onset of apoptosis in a similar way to IGF-1, demonstrating an IGF-1-specific effect. Only the supraphysiological levels of insulin (5 μg/ml), found in keratinocyte complete medium, were also able to delay the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Insulin not only binds to the insulin receptor, but also has some affinity for the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). These high concentrations of insulin activate the IGF-1R (4Kuhn C. Hurwitz S.A. Kumar M.G. Cotton J. Spandau D.F. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As physiological concentrations of insulin (10 ng/ml) did not delay UVB-induced apoptosis, the observed delay by supraphysiological levels of insulin is most likely due to IGF-1R activation.Because the induction of apoptosis after UVB irradiation is highly dependent on the amount of DNA damage induced and the subsequent (in)ability of the cell to repair damaged DNA (31Ljungman M. Zhang F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 823-831PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether IGF-1-mediated postponement of the induction of UVB-induced apoptosis affects nucleotide excision repair of UVB-induced lesions. We studied nucleotide excision repair by the detection of UV-induced photolesions, the cyclobutane thymine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts, using the immuno-dot-blot technique with monoclonal antibodies directed against these bulky DNA adducts. When irradiated with UVB doses that cause early induced apoptosis (16 mJ/cm2), hardly any cyclobutane thymine dimer removal was observed in growth factor-deprived cells, in contrast to cells grown in complete medium or cells supplemented with IGF-1 prior to UVB irradiation. However, these growth factor-deprived cells became as proficient as IGF-1-treated cells in nucleotide excision repair of cyclobutane thymine dimers when the apoptotic process itself was inhibited with a global caspase inhibitor (Fig. 4), indicating that a delay in the onset of apoptosis indeed gives the cell more time to repair DNA damage. The observed increase in removal of cyclobutane thymine dimers in IGF-1-supplemented cells can be attributed only to the postponement of apoptosis by >7 h. These data indicate, in contrast to the study of Heáron-Milhavetet al. (35Heáron-Milhavet L. Karas M. Goldsmith C.M. Baum B.J. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18185-18192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), that the intrinsic nucleotide excision repair capacity of the cell is unaffected by IGF-1 supplementation. However, the observed IGF-1-mediated delay in the onset of apoptosis provides the cell with more time to repair cyclobutane thymine dimers. On the contrary, (6-4) photoproducts are almost completely removed within the first hours after UVB irradiation (36Mitchell D.L. Brash D.E. Nairn R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Due to this fast removal, no significant differences in (6-4) photoproduct repair could be observed for growth factor-deprived cells versus cells grown in complete medium.Lesions are initially removed quickly from the genome, followed by a slower removal of the remaining lesions. This can be attributed to the biphasic nature of nucleotide excision repair (37McCarthy M.J. Rosenblatt J.I. Lloyd R.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1997; 66: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although the global genome has to be screened for the presence of lesions (global genomic repair), actively transcribed genes can be repaired much faster. Lesions present on these genes stall RNA polymerase II (38Donahue B.A. Yin S. Taylor J.S. Reines D. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8502-8506Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), leading to a fast recruitment of the nucleotide excision repair complex (39Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23465-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). This has been called transcription-coupled repair or preferential repair. It is the persistence of lesions on these transcribed strands that leads to a high p53 induction and an increase in cells undergoing apoptosis (31Ljungman M. Zhang F. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 823-831PubMed Google Scholar, 40Yamaizumi M. Sugano T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2775-2784PubMed Google Scholar). Only cyclobutane thymine dimers on transcribed DNA affect survival (41Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 737-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A delay in the onset of apoptosis signaling provides enough time for the cell to repair cyclobutane thymine dimers on transcribed genes when they are irradiated with UVB doses ranging from 16 to 32 mJ/cm2. Although IGF-1 does not contribute to an increased survival at UVB doses higher than 16–32 mJ/cm2, a clear postponement of the onset of apoptosis by >7 h can readily be observed at these higher UVB doses. This is a strong argument for our hypothesis that not IGF-1 signaling itself, but increased repair of cyclobutane thymine dimers leads to a weakening of the apoptotic stimulus because DNA damage induced by these high UVB doses is too high to be removed efficiently in these extra hours provided to the cell and thus, with or without IGF-1 supplementation, inevitably leads to the induction of apoptosis.If IGF-1 enhances survival only by providing more time for nucleotide excision repair of cyclobutane thymine dimers, then IGF-1 should be required only during this time period. A survival experiment in which we varied the time that cells were exposed to IGF-1 after UVB irradiation potentiates this hypothesis. In this experiment, we demonstrated that IGF-1 was required only during the first 10 h after UVB irradiation; a longer incubation with IGF-1 did not contribute to an increased survival of keratinocytes after UVB irradiation.The delay in the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis by IGF-1 was prevented by pretreatment with wortmannin, an irreversible inhibitor of PI3K, implying a role for PI3K. IGF-1 is a potent activator of the AKT pathway through activation of PI3K (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). We subsequently examined the phosphorylation status of AKT after growth factor supplementation. Of all the growth factors tested, only IGF-1 supplementation led to sustained phosphorylation of Thr308 as well as Ser473 and therefore to sustained AKT activation (Fig. 6), further supporting the role of AKT in the delay of the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis. On behalf of the AKT phosphorylation at Ser473 by the hypothetical PDK2 kinase, two different views emerge. One view proposes that by interaction with other enzymes such as protein kinase C-related kinase-2, PDK1 itself could serve as the PDK2 kinase, phosphorylating AKT at Ser473 (20Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 23Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). The second view is supported by p38 MAPK inhibitor studies and suggests that the PDK2 kinase is a member of the p38 MAPK pathway (13Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar, 21Nomura M. Kaji A., Ma, W.-Y. Zhong S. Liu G. Bowden G.T. Miyamoto K.-i. Dong Z. J. Biol.

Both MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAP2) and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase-1 (MSK1), downstream targets of p38 MAPK, are able to phosphorylate AKT at Ser473in vitro (13Alessi D.R.

We used the pyridinylimidazole inhibitor PD169316 to examine a possible involvement of p38 MAPK in the activation of AKT and the delay in the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis. PD169316 not only blocked Ser473 phosphorylation, but prevented AKT phosphorylation at Thr308 as well when used at high concentrations (5–10 μm). Lali et al. (33Lali F.V. Hunt A.E. Turner S.J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7395-7402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) reported that the structurally related p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 is able to inhibit PDK1-induced AKT activation independently of p38 MAPK activation at a commonly used concentration range (5–10 μm), resulting not only in inhibition of Ser473 phosphorylation, but also in inhibition of Thr308 phosphorylation of AKT. Therefore, a dose-response experiment was conducted to examine the specificity of the PD169316 inhibitor. Lower concentrations of PD169316, which still inhibit p38 MAPK efficiently (34Gallagher T.F. Seibel G.L. Kassis S. Laydon J.T. Blumenthal M.J. Lee J.C. Lee D. Boehm J.C. Fier-Thompson S.M. Abt J.W. Soreson M.E. Smietana J.M. Hall R.F. Garigipati R.S. Bender P.E. Erhard K.F. Krog A.J.

Chem. 1997; 5: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), had no effect on the phosphorylation status of AKT, suggesting p38 MAPK-independent inhibition of AKT. Strikingly, these conditions also led to a strong inhibition of the IGF-1-mediated delay in the onset of UVB-induced apoptosis (Fig.7B), supporting the involvement of AKT in the postponement of UVB-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig.7A, PD169316 pretreatment of cells grown in complete medium (which contained supraphysiological levels of insulin) did not lead to early induced apoptosis. We hypothesize that this short preincubation with PD169316 is not enough to cancel the effects of prolonged IGF-1R signaling. As a consequence, it is plausible that the UVB response of keratinocytes grown in cell culture medium containing high concentrations of insulin does not accurately reflect the in vivo situation, as prolonged IGF-1R activation might lead to sustained activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway.The IGF-1R mediates a variety of tumor-promoting effects (10DiGiovanni J.

Cell. 1994; 79: 927-930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), among which delaying the induction of apoptosis probably is the most important. It is evident from our results that when global genomic repair is at stake, sustained activation of the IGF-1/AKT pathway could lead to an increased rate of permanent DNA damage incorporation caused by repeated UVB exposure. In contrast to “in vitro” conditions, where high concentrations of insulin are sometimes used, IGF-1 signaling is restricted in healthy epidermis. The main source of IGF-1 for epidermal keratinocytes (which do not synthesize IGF-1 themselves) is fibroblasts and melanocytes (6Tavakkol A. Elder J.T. Griffiths C.E. Cooper K.D. Talwar H.

This IGF-1 availability is limited through IGF-BP3 and repressed IGF-1R expression. Both up-regulation of IGF-BP3 and repression of IGF-1R expression are dependent on functional wild-type p53 (7Buckbinder L. Talbott R. Velasco-Miguel S. Takenaka I. Faha B. Seizinger B.R. Kley N.

Indeed, >90% of squamous cell carcinomas and >50% of basal cell carcinomas contain p53 mutations. Moreover, p53 mutations are also observed in actinic keratoses, indicating that p53 mutation is not only a frequent event, but also an early event, in skin carcinogenesis. The corresponding p53 mutation hot spots in these premalignant and malignant keratinocytes contain predominantly C-T transitions at dipyrimidine sites, a typical signature indicating that UVB light is the mutagen (1Brash D.E.

Wild-type p53 is also required for efficient global genomic repair (41Tang J.Y. Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Mol.

We have shown previously that activated human PBLs secrete MIP-1β in a complex with MIP-1α (14Guan E. Wang J. Norcross M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12404-12409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To date, however, the biological function of naturally produced MIP-1β has remained unclear.We have now purified MIP-1β from the culture supernatant of stimulated human PBLs by affinity chromatography and used this material to study the biological activity of native MIP-1β. Our results demonstrate that the endogenous form of MIP-1β, which lacks the first two amino acid residues of the encoded protein, is active at CCR1 and CCR2 in addition to CCR5 and retains anti-HIV-1 activity.DISCUSSIONWe have characterized the structure and function of the native form of MIP-1β that is secreted by activated human PBLs in vitro. MIP-1β was dissociated from its complex with MIP-1α under acidic conditions and then purified by affinity chromatography with a MIP-1β-specific monoclonal antibody. Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein revealed it to be a truncated form lacking the two NH2-terminal amino acids. The removal of the Ala-Pro dipeptide from the NH2 terminus of MIP-1β did not impair its biological activities mediated by CCR5; through its interaction with this receptor, the truncated protein thus induced down-modulation of the surface expression of CCR5, increased the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration, and inhibited CCR5-mediated entry of HIV-1. Unexpectedly, however, MIP-1β(3–69), unlike the full-length protein, also triggered a cellular Ca2+ response mediated by CCR1 or CCR2b.MIP-1β is a multifunctional factor secreted by T lymphocytes and monocytes in a complex with MIP-1α. It is a specific ligand for CCR5 and induces the migration of CCR5-positive macrophages and lymphocytes into tissues or lymph nodes. Our demonstration that MIP-1β(3–69) also interacts functionally with CCR1 and CCR2b suggests that secretion of this truncated protein with MIP-1α might also result in the attraction of cells that express CCR1 or CCR2, such as monocytes, immature dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, possibly through heterodimer-induced interactions between multiple receptors on the cell surface. The truncated form of MIP-1β may also act on regulatory T cells (CD4+, CD25+), which are thought to respond primarily to MIP-1β (23Bystry R.S. Aluvihare V. Welch K.A. Kallikourdis M. Betz A.G. Nat.

The differential expression of chemokine receptors by human Th1 and Th2 cells underlies the differential migration of these cells in response to various chemokines. Chemokines are thus important contributors to polarized Th1 cell- or Th2 cell-mediated immune responses. Truncation of the CCR5-specific chemokines RANTES and MIP-1β, possibly mediated by CD26 expressed on activated lymphocytes, does not affect their activities at CCR5, whereas cleavage of IP-10 (17Oravecz T.

Studies of recombinant MIP-1β(1–69) have demonstrated that this full-length protein induces intracellular Ca2+ signaling, exerts its chemotactic activity, and inhibits HIV-1 infection through interaction with the chemokine receptor CCR5. The specificity of chemokines for certain leukocyte subtypes depends on the expression by the latter of ligand-specific G protein-coupled receptors.

Recent studies have suggested that, among normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), perforin-low memory CD8+ T cells are the predominant producers of MIP-1β (13Kamin-Lewis R. Abdelwahab S.F.

We have shown previously that activated human PBLs secrete MIP-1β in a complex with MIP-1α (14Guan E. Wang J. Norcross M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12404-12409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To date, however, the biological function of naturally produced MIP-1β has remained unclear. We have now purified MIP-1β from the culture supernatant of stimulated human PBLs by affinity chromatography and used this material to study the biological activity of native MIP-1β. Our results demonstrate that the endogenous form of MIP-1β, which lacks the first two amino acid residues of the encoded protein, is active at CCR1 and CCR2 in addition to CCR5 and retains anti-HIV-1 activity. DISCUSSIONWe have characterized the structure and function of the native form of MIP-1β that is secreted by activated human PBLs in vitro. MIP-1β was dissociated from its complex with MIP-1α under acidic conditions and then purified by affinity chromatography with a MIP-1β-specific monoclonal antibody. Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein revealed it to be a truncated form lacking the two NH2-terminal amino acids. The removal of the Ala-Pro dipeptide from the NH2 terminus of MIP-1β did not impair its biological activities mediated by CCR5; through its interaction with this receptor, the truncated protein thus induced down-modulation of the surface expression of CCR5, increased the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration, and inhibited CCR5-mediated entry of HIV-1. Unexpectedly, however, MIP-1β(3–69), unlike the full-length protein, also triggered a cellular Ca2+ response mediated by CCR1 or CCR2b.MIP-1β is a multifunctional factor secreted by T lymphocytes and monocytes in a complex with MIP-1α. It is a specific ligand for CCR5 and induces the migration of CCR5-positive macrophages and lymphocytes into tissues or lymph nodes. Our demonstration that MIP-1β(3–69) also interacts functionally with CCR1 and CCR2b suggests that secretion of this truncated protein with MIP-1α might also result in the attraction of cells that express CCR1 or CCR2, such as monocytes, immature dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, possibly through heterodimer-induced interactions between multiple receptors on the cell surface. The truncated form of MIP-1β may also act on regulatory T cells (CD4+, CD25+), which are thought to respond primarily to MIP-1β (23Bystry R.S. Aluvihare V. Welch K.A. Kallikourdis M. Betz A.G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 2: 1126-1132Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar).

The differential expression of chemokine receptors by human Th1 and Th2 cells underlies the differential migration of these cells in response to various chemokines. Chemokines are thus important contributors to polarized Th1 cell- or Th2 cell-mediated immune responses. Truncation of the CCR5-specific chemokines RANTES and MIP-1β, possibly mediated by CD26 expressed on activated lymphocytes, does not affect their activities at CCR5, whereas cleavage of IP-10 (17Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G. Gorrell M.D. Ditto M. Nguyen N.Y. Boykins R. Unsworth E. Norcross M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), a ligand for CXCR3, results in loss of its activity at this latter receptor. In contrast, chemokines (such as eotaxin and MDC) that are ligands for receptors on Th2 cells (CCR4 and CCR3) are inactivated by CD26 (24Proost P. Struyf S. Schols D. Durinx C. Wuyts A.

Under these conditions, the interaction of truncated MIP-1β and RANTES with CCR5 may constitute the predominant pathway for Th1 cell recruitment. Further studies are required to determine both the mechanism of MIP-1β truncation and the impact of the expanded chemokine receptor reactivity of MIP-1β(3–69) with regard to lymphocyte, monocyte, and dendritic cell migration and differentiation. We have characterized the structure and function of the native form of MIP-1β that is secreted by activated human PBLs in vitro. MIP-1β was dissociated from its complex with MIP-1α under acidic conditions and then purified by affinity chromatography with a MIP-1β-specific monoclonal antibody. Mass spectrometric analysis of the purified protein revealed it to be a truncated form lacking the two NH2-terminal amino acids. The removal of the Ala-Pro dipeptide from the NH2 terminus of MIP-1β did not impair its biological activities mediated by CCR5; through its interaction with this receptor, the truncated protein thus induced down-modulation of the surface expression of CCR5, increased the cytosolic-free Ca2+ concentration, and inhibited CCR5-mediated entry of HIV-1. Unexpectedly, however, MIP-1β(3–69), unlike the full-length protein, also triggered a cellular Ca2+ response mediated by CCR1 or CCR2b. MIP-1β is a multifunctional factor secreted by T lymphocytes and monocytes in a complex with MIP-1α. It is a specific ligand for CCR5 and induces the migration of CCR5-positive macrophages and lymphocytes into tissues or lymph nodes. Our demonstration that MIP-1β(3–69) also interacts functionally with CCR1 and CCR2b suggests that secretion of this truncated protein with MIP-1α might also result in the attraction of cells that express CCR1 or CCR2, such as monocytes, immature dendritic cells, and lymphocytes, possibly through heterodimer-induced interactions between multiple receptors on the cell surface. The truncated form of MIP-1β may also act on regulatory T cells (CD4+, CD25+), which are thought to respond primarily to MIP-1β (23Bystry R.S. Aluvihare V. Welch K.A. Kallikourdis M. Betz A.G. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 2: 1126-1132Crossref Scopus (405) Google Scholar). MIP-1β(3–69) appears to be produced only by activated T cells; it has not been detected in culture supernatants of monocytes or macrophages (14Guan E. Wang J. Norcross M.A. J. Biol.

Relatively small changes in the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence thus markedly affect the biological activity of chemokines. Members of both the CC and CXC subfamilies of chemokines occur naturally as post-translationally modified proteins. We and others have shown that the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) (CD26) plays an important role in the processing of chemokines that contain a penultimate alanine or proline residue at the NH2 termini and that such processing influences the functional properties of chemokines including RANTES, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)/CXCL12, eotaxin/CCL11, IP-10/CXCL10 (interferon-γ-inducible protein 10), granulocyte chemotactic protein/CXCL6, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)/CCL22, and MIP-1α(P)/LD78β (17Oravecz T.

The removal of the NH2-terminal dipeptide from RANTES, SDF-1α, or MDC results in reduced receptor binding and signaling and consequent impairment of chemotactic responses. Such truncation of RANTES also results in a loss of the ability to signal through CCR1, in contrast to the situation with MIP-1β, which gains activity at CCR1. RANTES(3–68), like MIP-1β(3–69), retains activity at CCR5 (17Oravecz T. Pall M. Roderiquez G. Gorrell M.D. Ditto M. Nguyen N.Y. Boykins R. Unsworth E. Norcross M.A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal modification of other chemokines has been shown to result in gain of function. The NH2-terminal truncation of IL-8, ENA-78 (epithelial cell-derived neutrophil-activating protein), and MIP-1α results in enhanced proinflammatory activity, and that of MIP-1α/LD78β/CCL3 increases anti-HIV-1 activity (35Nufer O.

Although the presence of a proline in the second NH2-terminal position of MIP-1β suggests that DPPIV (CD26) is a candidate enzyme for this cleavage reaction, it has proved difficult to demonstrate processing of recombinant MIP-1β by DPPIV (24Proost P.

Chemokine receptors and other molecules are differentially expressed by human T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells.

The expression of CD26 correlates with the production of interferon-γ in Th1 cell-associated granulomatous disorders and in inflamed synovia in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (37Muller A.

We investigated the mechanism of TAS-103-induced apoptosis in human cell lines. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis revealed that in the leukemia cell line HL-60 and the H2O2-resistant subclone, HP100, TAS-103 induced DNA cleavage to form 1–2-Mb fragments at 1 h to a similar extent, indicating that the DNA cleavage was induced independently of H2O2. TAS-103-induced DNA ladder formation in HP100 cells was delayed compared with that seen at 4 h in HL-60 cells, suggesting the involvement of H2O2-mediated pathways in apoptosis. Flow cytometry revealed that H2O2 formation preceded increases in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and caspase-3 activation. Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) prevented both TAS-103-induced H2O2 generation and DNA ladder formation. The levels of NAD+, a PARP substrate, were significantly decreased in HL-60 cells after a 3-h incubation with TAS-103. The decreases in NAD+ levels preceded both increases in ΔΨm and DNA ladder formation. Inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase prevented TAS-103-induced apoptosis, suggesting that NAD(P)H oxidase is the primary enzyme mediating H2O2formation. Expression of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, in BJAB cells drastically inhibited TAS-103-induced apoptosis, confirming that H2O2 generation occurs upstream of mitochondrial permeability transition. Therefore, these findings indicate that DNA cleavage by TAS-103 induces PARP hyperactivation and subsequent NAD+ depletion, followed by the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase.

However, the mechanism of ROS formation by anticancer drugs remains to be clarified.TAS-103 (Fig. 1), a new quinoline derivative, induces DNA cleavage through the inhibition of DNA topoisomerases I and II (18Utsugi T.

Yamada Y. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15573-15579Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alteration in the topology of DNA by intercalation of TAS-103 results in inhibition of topoisomerase I-catalyzed DNA relaxation (21Fortune J.M. Velea L. Graves D.E. Utsugi T. Yamada Y. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15580-15586Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The anticancer activity of TAS-103 has a broad spectrum. The cytotoxicity of TAS-103 (IC50: 0.0030–0.23 μm) is much greater against various tumor cell lines than etoposide and comparable with SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan (CPT-11) (22Aoyagi Y. Kobunai T. Utsugi T. Oh-hara T. Yamada Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Due to this potent cytotoxicity at low concentrations, TAS-103 must have specific inhibitory effects on topoisomerases. TAS-103 is therefore expected to be a novel and promising anticancer drug, currently under clinical evaluation in the United States (23Ewesuedo R.B. Iyer L. Das S. Koenig A. Mani S. Vogelzang N.J.

We investigated apoptosis induction by TAS-103 in HL-60 cells and HP100 cells, H2O2-resistant cells derived from HL-60. Apoptosis was analyzed by examining DNA cleavage, DNA ladder formation, NAD+ depletion, H2O2 generation, mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) change, and caspase-3 activation. The mechanism of TAS-103-induced H2O2 generation was examined by using inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and NAD(P)H oxidase. Moreover, to clarify whether H2O2 generation via NAD(P)H oxidase occurs upstream or downstream of the MPT, we examined the effect of the expression of Bcl-2 on TAS-103-induced apoptosis in the human B cell line, BJAB cells.DISCUSSIONTAS-103 induced DNA cleavage in HL-60 cells after a 1-h treatment; the formation of DNA ladders was observed at 4 h. Therefore, DNA cleavage initiates the apoptotic process, subsequently resulting in DNA ladder formation. This study has clarified the mechanism of TAS-103-induced apoptosis from the early events of DNA cleavage to eventual DNA ladder formation (Fig.11). DNA cleavage is initiated by TAS-103-mediated inhibition of topoisomerases (1Sellers W.R. Fisher D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Kaufmann S.H.

PARP inhibitors, ANI and PHEN, prevented DNA ladder formation following TAS-103 treatment of HL-60 cells, indicating that TAS-103-induced apoptosis requires PARP hyperactivation. PARP hyperactivation accelerates the consumption of NAD+, a PARP substrate (36Scovassi A.I. Poirier G.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 199: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,37Martin D.S. Bertino J.R. Koutcher J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6776-6783PubMed Google Scholar, 42Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol.

The decrease in NADP+ at 2–3 h appears to be delayed compared with that in NAD+ by ∼30 min, suggesting that NADP+ may be converted to NAD+ by phosphatase for the supplementation of NAD+. Relevantly, the interconversion of pyridine nucleotides in such circumstances has previously been reported (43Stubberfield C.R. Cohen G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2631-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, PARP hyperactivation results in the depletion of both NAD+ and NADP+.FIG. 11Suggested mechanism of TAS-103-induced apoptosis mediated by hydrogen peroxide generation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)TAS-103 induced apoptosis in both HL-60 and the H2O2-resistant clone, HP100. DNA cleavage was induced in these cells at 1 h to a similar extent by TAS-103, suggesting that the cleavage is caused by the inhibition of topoisomerases without H2O2 generation. DNA ladder formation in HP100 cells, however, was delayed to 6 h from 4 h in HL-60 parental cells. This delay can be explained by the involvement of H2O2 generation in the apoptotic pathway. In HP100 cells, H2O2 generation, increases in ΔΨm and caspase-3 activation were suppressed relative to the levels observed in HL-60 cells. H2O2formation precedes increases in ΔΨm and caspase-3 activation in TAS-103-induced apoptosis; in HL-60 cells, H2O2generation occurred at 3 h, followed by increases in ΔΨm and caspase-3 activation at 4 h (Fig. 11), whereas in HP100 cells, H2O2 generation occurred at 3–4 h, with increases in ΔΨm at 5 h and caspase-3 activation at 5–6 h. Therefore, intracellular H2O2 generation is critical in these TAS-103-induced apoptotic events. PARP inhibitors inhibited both H2O2 generation at 3 h and changes in ΔΨm at 4–5 h in HL-60 cells, indicating that TAS-103-induced PARP hyperactivation is important for H2O2 generation.Here, the question has been raised how TAS-103 induces generation of H2O2. On the basis of our data, we propose the possible mechanism by which TAS-103 induces the generation of intracellular H2O2 as follows: the PARP-catalyzed depletion of both NAD+ and NADP+in cells treated with TAS-103 may result in the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase to maintain the cellular redox balance by converting NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+ (44Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NAD(P)H oxidase catalyzes the following reaction: NAD(P)H + 2O2 → 2O2− + NAD(P)+ + H+. O2− is then rapidly converted to H2O2 (45Jones R.D. Hancock J.T. Morice A.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported by our observations that inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase inhibited TAS-103-induced DNA ladder formation in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, rotenone, which can inhibit mitochondrial ROS production (46Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), did not inhibit TAS-103-induced DNA ladder formation (data not shown). This result excludes the possibility that ROS are released from mitochondria. The decreases in intracellular GSH may also induce ROS generation (13Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 47Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Significant GSH decreases were not observed until 6 h, suggesting this GSH decrease does not mediate early generation of H2O2. Therefore, NAD(P)H oxidase is the primary enzyme mediating H2O2formation in cells treated with TAS-103. In addition, p53activation by DNA damage induces apoptosis by the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes and the formation of ROS (48Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2226) Google Scholar, 49Johnson T.M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Lowenstein R.A. Finkel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

TAS-103-induced H2O2 generation was not inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor (data not shown), confirming that activation of NAD(P)H oxidase occurs upstream of caspase-3 activation. Our results revealed that H2O2 generation via NAD(P)H oxidase activation precedes the ΔΨm increase in TAS-103-induced apoptosis. Bcl-2 binds to the voltage-dependent anion channel to regulate the mitochondrial membrane potential, and controls the release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors, cytochromec and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a mitochondrial flavoprotein (54Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 55Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Our experiment using BJAB/Bcl-2 cells confirmed that Bcl-2 prevented TAS-103-induced apoptosis by inhibiting MPT mediated by H2O2 generation. AIF has an NADH oxidase activity, but DPI, an NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, does not affect the apoptogenic activity of AIF (56Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G.

Our data that DPI prevented TAS-103-induced apoptosis exclude the possibility that the NAD(P)H oxidase activity of AIF is involved in apoptosis. It has been reported that the activity of NAD(P)H oxidase in microsomes is linked to cytosolic NAD(H) redox and appears to be a key source of O2− production (57Mohazzab K.M. Kaminsky P.M. Wollin M.S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together, the activation of microsomal NAD(P)H oxidase may participate in TAS-103-induced H2O2 generation. In conclusion, H2O2 generation precedes MPT, leading to subsequent apoptotic events, including cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in TAS-103-induced apoptosis. A number of anticancer drugs exert their effects by inducing apoptosis (1Sellers W.R. Fisher D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 42-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). The major apoptotic pathways act either through the induction of death receptors or the loss of mitochondrial membrane integrity (1Sellers W.R. Fisher D.E. J. Clin.

TAS-103 (Fig. 1), a new quinoline derivative, induces DNA cleavage through the inhibition of DNA topoisomerases I and II (18Utsugi T. Aoyagi K. Asao T. Okazaki S. Aoyagi Y. Sano M. Wierzba K.

Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently, TAS-103 is classified as a topoisomerase II-targeted drug (19Byl J.A. Fortune J.M. Burden D.A. Nitiss J.L. Utsugi T. Yamada Y. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15573-15579Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Alteration in the topology of DNA by intercalation of TAS-103 results in inhibition of topoisomerase I-catalyzed DNA relaxation (21Fortune J.M. Velea L. Graves D.E. Utsugi T. Yamada Y. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15580-15586Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The anticancer activity of TAS-103 has a broad spectrum. The cytotoxicity of TAS-103 (IC50: 0.0030–0.23 μm) is much greater against various tumor cell lines than etoposide and comparable with SN-38, an active metabolite of irinotecan (CPT-11) (22Aoyagi Y. Kobunai T. Utsugi T. Oh-hara T. Yamada Y. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1999; 90: 578-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Due to this potent cytotoxicity at low concentrations, TAS-103 must have specific inhibitory effects on topoisomerases. TAS-103 is therefore expected to be a novel and promising anticancer drug, currently under clinical evaluation in the United States (23Ewesuedo R.B. Iyer L. Das S. Koenig A. Mani S. Vogelzang N.J. Schilsky R.L. Brenckman W. Ratain M.J. J. Clin. Oncol. 2001; 19: 2084-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although good evidence exists that TAS-103 induces apoptosis (24Ohyama T., Li, Y. Utsugi T. Irie S. Yamada Y. Sato T. Jpn. J.

Here, we sought to analyze the mechanism of apoptosis induction by anticancer drugs through the generation of ROS.

Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 55Tsujimoto Y. Shimizu S. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Our experiment using BJAB/Bcl-2 cells confirmed that Bcl-2 prevented TAS-103-induced apoptosis by inhibiting MPT mediated by H2O2 generation. AIF has an NADH oxidase activity, but DPI, an NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, does not affect the apoptogenic activity of AIF (56Miramar M.D. Costantini P. Ravagnan L. Saraiva L.M. Haouzi D. Brothers G.

Our data that DPI prevented TAS-103-induced apoptosis exclude the possibility that the NAD(P)H oxidase activity of AIF is involved in apoptosis. It has been reported that the activity of NAD(P)H oxidase in microsomes is linked to cytosolic NAD(H) redox and appears to be a key source of O2− production (57Mohazzab K.M. Kaminsky P.M. Wollin M.S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together, the activation of microsomal NAD(P)H oxidase may participate in TAS-103-induced H2O2 generation. In conclusion, H2O2 generation precedes MPT, leading to subsequent apoptotic events, including cytochrome c release and caspase-3 activation in TAS-103-induced apoptosis. TAS-103 induced DNA cleavage in HL-60 cells after a 1-h treatment; the formation of DNA ladders was observed at 4 h. Therefore, DNA cleavage initiates the apoptotic process, subsequently resulting in DNA ladder formation. This study has clarified the mechanism of TAS-103-induced apoptosis from the early events of DNA cleavage to eventual DNA ladder formation (Fig.11). DNA cleavage is initiated by TAS-103-mediated inhibition of topoisomerases (1Sellers W.R. Fisher D.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1655-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Kaufmann S.H.

Excessive DNA damage causes PARP hyperactivation to repair DNA (35Bertrand R. Solary E. Jenkins J. Pommier Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 207: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36Scovassi A.I. Poirier G.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 199: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 37Martin D.S.

Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). PARP inhibitors, ANI and PHEN, prevented DNA ladder formation following TAS-103 treatment of HL-60 cells, indicating that TAS-103-induced apoptosis requires PARP hyperactivation. PARP hyperactivation accelerates the consumption of NAD+, a PARP substrate (36Scovassi A.I. Poirier G.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 199: 125-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,37Martin D.S. Bertino J.R. Koutcher J.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6776-6783PubMed Google Scholar, 42Chiarugi A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 122-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). NAD+ and NADP+ levels decreased in HL-60 cells treated with TAS-103 in less than 3 h. The decrease in NADP+ at 2–3 h appears to be delayed compared with that in NAD+ by ∼30 min, suggesting that NADP+ may be converted to NAD+ by phosphatase for the supplementation of NAD+. Relevantly, the interconversion of pyridine nucleotides in such circumstances has previously been reported (43Stubberfield C.R. Cohen G.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2631-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, PARP hyperactivation results in the depletion of both NAD+ and NADP+. TAS-103 induced apoptosis in both HL-60 and the H2O2-resistant clone, HP100. DNA cleavage was induced in these cells at 1 h to a similar extent by TAS-103, suggesting that the cleavage is caused by the inhibition of topoisomerases without H2O2 generation. DNA ladder formation in HP100 cells, however, was delayed to 6 h from 4 h in HL-60 parental cells. This delay can be explained by the involvement of H2O2 generation in the apoptotic pathway. In HP100 cells, H2O2 generation, increases in ΔΨm and caspase-3 activation were suppressed relative to the levels observed in HL-60 cells. H2O2formation precedes increases in ΔΨm and caspase-3 activation in TAS-103-induced apoptosis; in HL-60 cells, H2O2generation occurred at 3 h, followed by increases in ΔΨm and caspase-3 activation at 4 h (Fig. 11), whereas in HP100 cells, H2O2 generation occurred at 3–4 h, with increases in ΔΨm at 5 h and caspase-3 activation at 5–6 h. Therefore, intracellular H2O2 generation is critical in these TAS-103-induced apoptotic events. PARP inhibitors inhibited both H2O2 generation at 3 h and changes in ΔΨm at 4–5 h in HL-60 cells, indicating that TAS-103-induced PARP hyperactivation is important for H2O2 generation. Here, the question has been raised how TAS-103 induces generation of H2O2. On the basis of our data, we propose the possible mechanism by which TAS-103 induces the generation of intracellular H2O2 as follows: the PARP-catalyzed depletion of both NAD+ and NADP+in cells treated with TAS-103 may result in the activation of NAD(P)H oxidase to maintain the cellular redox balance by converting NAD(P)H to NAD(P)+ (44Toomey D. Mayhew S.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). NAD(P)H oxidase catalyzes the following reaction: NAD(P)H + 2O2 → 2O2− + NAD(P)+ + H+. O2− is then rapidly converted to H2O2 (45Jones R.D. Hancock J.T. Morice A.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This possibility is supported by our observations that inhibitors of NAD(P)H oxidase inhibited TAS-103-induced DNA ladder formation in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, rotenone, which can inhibit mitochondrial ROS production (46Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), did not inhibit TAS-103-induced DNA ladder formation (data not shown). This result excludes the possibility that ROS are released from mitochondria. The decreases in intracellular GSH may also induce ROS generation (13Chandra J. Samali A. Orrenius S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar, 47Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Significant GSH decreases were not observed until 6 h, suggesting this GSH decrease does not mediate early generation of H2O2. Therefore, NAD(P)H oxidase is the primary enzyme mediating H2O2formation in cells treated with TAS-103. In addition, p53activation by DNA damage induces apoptosis by the transcriptional induction of redox-related genes and the formation of ROS (48Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

TAS-103-induced H2O2 generation was not inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor (data not shown), confirming that activation of NAD(P)H oxidase occurs upstream of caspase-3 activation.

https://openalex.org/W2018788397,"Pancreatic β-cell metabolism was followed during glucose and pyruvate stimulation of pancreatic islets using quantitative two-photon NAD(P)H imaging. The observed redox changes, spatially separated between the cytoplasm and mitochondria, were compared with whole islet insulin secretion. As expected, both NAD(P)H and insulin secretion showed sustained increases in response to glucose stimulation. In contrast, pyruvate caused a much lower NAD(P)H response and did not generate insulin secretion. Low pyruvate concentrations decreased cytoplasmic NAD(P)H without affecting mitochondrial NAD(P)H, whereas higher concentrations increased cytoplasmic and mitochondrial levels. However, the pyruvate-stimulated mitochondrial increase was transient and equilibrated to nearbase-line levels. Inhibitors of the mitochondrial pyruvate-transporter and malate-aspartate shuttle were utilized to resolve the glucose- and pyruvate-stimulated NAD(P)H response mechanisms. These data showed that glucose-stimulated mitochondrial NAD(P)H and insulin secretion are independent of pyruvate transport but dependent on NAD(P)H shuttling. In contrast, the pyruvate-stimulated cytoplasmic NAD(P)H response was enhanced by both inhibitors. Surprisingly the malate-aspartate shuttle inhibitor enabled pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion. These data support a model in which glycolysis plays a dominant role in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Based on these data, we propose a mechanism for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion that includes allosteric inhibition of tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes and pH dependence of mitochondrial pyruvate transport.

Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 351-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and [ATP]/[ADP] ratio (4Ashcroft S.J. Weerasinghe L.C. Randle P.J. Biochem. J. 1973; 132: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The current model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS)1 by pancreatic islets predicts that a change in β-cell redox state increases the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio, which leads to closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and depolarization of the plasma membrane. Membrane depolarization results in Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated channels and subsequent insulin release (5Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Thus, any metabolite causing an increase in [ATP]/[ADP] should result in insulin secretion. However, this model fails to describe why the glycolytic intermediates glycerol 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (6Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and the mitochondrial substrates leucine (7Malaisse W.J. Hutton J.C. Carpinelli A.R. Herchuelz A. Sener A. Diabetes. 1980; 29: 431-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and methyl pyruvate (8Zawalich W.S. Zawalich K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3527-3531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), fail to mimic the insulin secretion effects of glucose. Furthermore, this model does not explain why other mitochondrial metabolites (e.g. pyruvate and succinate) fail to stimulate insulin secretion. Despite its inability to induce insulin secretion, pyruvate can potentiate GSIS (5Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), a phenomenon known as the “pyruvate dilemma.” The potentiation of GSIS indicates that pyruvate is metabolized in pancreatic islets, but the extent and mechanism of this metabolism remains unclear. Because pyruvate is a mitochondrial fuel, the pyruvate dilemma has led to the suggestion that glycolysis and mitochondrial NADH shuttles play the primary role in GSIS (9Dukes I.D. McIntyre M.S. Mertz R.J. Philipson L.H. Roe M.W. Spencer B. Worley III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10979-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that glucose-induced Ca2+ influx is independent of mitochondrial pyruvate transport but depends on the electron transport chain (9Dukes I.D. McIntyre M.S. Mertz R.J. Philipson L.H. Roe M.W. Spencer B. Worley III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10979-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, pancreatic islets from mice containing a deletion of the mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, which is critical for the glycerophosphate shuttle, demonstrate normal GSIS until this response is abolished by treatment with a malate-aspartate shuttle inhibitor (10Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that GSIS is more dependent on the malate-aspartate shuttle for ATP production. In pancreatic islets, ∼90% of glucose-derived pyruvate enters the mitochondria for oxidation (11Schuit F., De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), although it has been proposed that the tricarboxylic acid cycle of β-cells does not actively metabolize pyruvate until Ca2+-dependent dehydrogenases are “primed” by Ca2+ influx (10Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In this model, glycolytic NADH induces a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane and consequently stimulates mitochondrial Ca2+influx. However, this model is inconsistent with previous NAD(P)H measurements that showed an increase in mitochondrial metabolism well before Ca2+ influx (1Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). It has also been proposed that pyruvate is not sufficiently transported across the β-cell plasma membrane due to low expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) and that this effect inhibits β-cell pyruvate metabolism enough to abrogate secretion (12Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To address these models, we examined the fate of exogenous pyruvate as well as glucose-derived pyruvate in the β-cells of pancreatic islets. In the present study, we have used two-photon microscopy of NAD(P)H autofluorescence to monitor metabolism of living β-cells within intact pancreatic islets. The metabolic measurements were performed in parallel with insulin secretion measurements by an islet perfusion system. Two-photon NAD(P)H microscopy has proven successful for monitoring β-cell redox state in pancreatic islets (1Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 2Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Trends Endocrinol.

This technique provides adequate spatial and temporal resolution to follow both cytoplasmic and mitochondrial NAD(P)H responses from individual β-cells within intact islets during stimulated insulin secretion (1Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Glucose-induced increases in mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels can be caused by malate-aspartate shuttling of glycolytically produced NAD(P)H and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism of the glycolytically produced pyruvate. Because the glycerophosphate shuttle utilizes flavoproteins to transfer cytoplasmic NADH electrons to the electron transport chain, it is not expected to directly increase mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels. To delineate mitochondrial NAD(P)H changes due to either glycolysis or tricarboxylic acid cycling, we utilized two inhibitors: α-hydroxy-4-cinnamic acid (αCHC), an inhibitor of mitochondrial pyruvate transport (9Dukes I.D. McIntyre M.S. Mertz R.J. Philipson L.H. Roe M.W. Spencer B. Worley III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10979-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1976; 156: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and aminooxyacetate (AOA), an inhibitor of the malate-aspartate shuttle (10Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 15MacDonald M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 213: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Importantly, glycolysis is unaffected by αCHC (16Best L. Tomlinson S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2019-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) or AOA (10Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), and glucose oxidation is unaffected by AOA (10Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Therefore, with αCHC treatment, observed changes in mitochondrial NAD(P)H would be mainly due to malate-aspartate shuttling, whereas observed changes in the presence of AOA would be related to pyruvate metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The NAD(P)H response could then be compared quantitatively with insulin secretion by islets in the presence and absence of these inhibitors. Islets were extracted from 6- to 12-week-old C57BL/6 male mice by collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) digestion (17Stefan Y. Meda P. Neufeld M. Orci L. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Scharp D.W. Kemp C.B. Knight M.J. Ballinger W.F. Lacy P.E. Transplantation. 1973; 16: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Prior to perfusion studies, islets were cultured in untreated culture dishes for 24 h in RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen) with 11 mm glucose at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For NAD(P)H imaging, isolated pancreatic islets were placed on Cell-Tak (BD PharMingen) coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek Corp.) as previously described for microscopy analysis (3Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 351-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Islets were also routinely cultured on cell matrix (BD PharMingen). After ∼14 days the cell matrix promotes spreading, and the islets flatten in appearance. These islets have been shown to function normally, and in particular, they exhibit normal NAD(P)H and insulin secretion responses to glucose (1Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Arkhammar P.O.G. Terry B.R. Kofod H. Thastrup O. Methods Cell Sci. 1998; 18: 1-14Google Scholar). Prior to experiments, these islets were equilibrated in BMHH buffer (125 mm NaCl, 5.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4), and metabolites were added as indicated. The two-photon microscope instrument, described previously (3Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 351-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), uses 150-fs pulses at 710 nm light from a Coherent Mira laser and fills the back aperture of a 40× Plan Neofluar 1.3 NA objective lens (Zeiss). The laser illumination used provides ∼3 milliwatts at sample, which does not cause observable damage to islets (21Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L. Ying G. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3647-3651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) even after 60 min of continuous imaging (3Piston D.W. Knobel S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 307: 351-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The NAD(P)H fluorescence was collected with a custom 380- to 550-nm filter. Images were analyzed using Scion Image release version beta 3B (Scion Corp.). Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic intensity extraction images were collected at the edge of flattened islets using a 0.1-μm/pixel resolution. With flattened pancreatic islets, each image contained ∼10–50 cells. Image stacks were filtered using a 7 × 7 mean filter, and intensity thresholds were set that highlighted the bright areas known to be mitochondria (1Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). With this threshold, the “Analyze Particles” function was used to obtain the maximum intensity of each of these bright areas. The brightest 15–50 areas were used to calculate mitochondrial intensity. These areas represent the best in focus mitochondria. For cytoplasmic intensity, a threshold was set on these filtered images to levels that highlighted moderately bright areas. The threshold values were assigned by first determining the bottom (nuclear) and top (mitochondrial) levels in each image. Once this range was set the average intensity of the thresholded image was measured. This process was carried out three times to obtain the most precise measure of the cytoplasmic intensity. This threshold method for intensity extraction is faster and more robust than the manual sampling method used previously (1Patterson G.H. Knobel S.M. Arkhammar P. Thastrup O. Piston D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5203-5207Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), but both methods produce similar values when used on identical images. Mitochondrial and cytoplasmic NAD(P)H concentrations were determined from an NADH-yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) (Sigma) standard curve. A solution composed of 2 mg/ml ADH, 6 mm semicarbazide, 10 mmethanol, 100 mm isobutyramide, and 10 mm HEPES pH 8.0 was titrated with a freshly made 10 mm NADH solution. Images were collected at 0, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400 μm NADH. Insulin secretion was assessed by altering the extracellular glucose and pyruvate in a cell perfusion system (23Wang T. Lacik I. Brissova M. Anilkumar A.V. Prokop A. Hunkeler D. Green R. Shahrokhi K. Powers A.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In these studies, 50–60 mouse pancreatic islets were placed in each column. Islets were equilibrated in 2.8 mm glucose, 125 mm NaCl, 5.7 mmKCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmMgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma). Raising the extracellular glucose concentration from 2.8 to 20 mm and monitoring insulin secretion was used to assess islet function and integrity. A flow rate of 1 ml/min was used with each fraction containing 3 ml of effluent. Radioimmunoassays were done in duplicate on each fraction using insulin antibody-coated tubes (INC Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA). Lactate production from pancreatic islets was measured as described (18Brandt R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) except NADH production was measured fluorescently, using a L-format fluorescence spectrometer (Photon Technology International). Islet incubations were done using ∼40 islets in a total volume of 350 μl at 37 °C for 4 h. The NAD(P)H response of pancreatic islets was followed during glucose and pyruvate metabolism (Fig. 1). In these studies, a single pancreatic islet was equilibrated on the microscope stage at 37 °C. The images shown were collected at 0, 180, and 590 s after the addition of 20 mm pyruvate (Fig. 1, A, B, and C). This same islet was treated with 20 mm glucose at 600 s, and the final image collected was at 880 s (Fig. 1D). Addition of pyruvate caused an increase in NAD(P)H across the pancreatic islet (Fig. 1, A versus B), although this increase was transient (Fig. 1, A versus C). Addition of glucose to this same islet increased the NAD(P)H intensity (Fig. 1, C versus D). Fig. 1Esummarizes the NAD(P)H responses of five separate islets treated similarly to Fig. 1, A–D. These data were collected from the islet center (<75% of the pancreatic islet) because the perimeter of the islet also contains α- and δ-cells (21Bennett B.D. Jetton T.L. Ying G. Magnuson M.A. Piston D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3647-3651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The addition of 20 mm pyruvate caused an initial decrease in intensity, which then increased to a maximum of 1.5-fold base line at ∼180 s. This increase was transient because the intensity decreased to 1.2-fold base line at ∼600 s. Addition of glucose at 600 s increased NAD(P)H intensity to a maximum 1.8-fold within 150 s. In contrast to pyruvate, glucose caused a sustained NAD(P)H response. To explore the initial decrease in pyruvate-stimulated NAD(P)H responses, we acquired pyruvate dose-response data (Fig.1F). At 2, 4, and 8 mm pyruvate, the decrease was transient with the intensity recovering to an equilibrium just below 1.0-fold NAD(P)H intensity by 250 s. At higher pyruvate concentrations (16 and 20 mm), the 0.6- and 0.7-fold intensity decreases at 40–50 s were followed by large transient increases in NAD(P)H intensity. The NAD(P)H intensity rose to a maximum of 1.3- and 1.4-fold intensity for 16 and 20 mm pyruvate, respectively, at 180 s before falling to intensities of 1.2- and 1.3-fold at 270 s. Therefore, pyruvate caused observable NAD(P)H changes at all concentrations studied, and all of the observed responses were transient. Dose responses of NAD(P)H levels were determined in flattened islets to measure mitochondrial and cytoplasmic regions (Fig.2). Islets were treated with glucose (Fig. 2, A and C) or pyruvate (Fig. 2, B and D), and images were collected at 0, 80, and 270 s. Glucose above 4 mm induced a significant cytoplasmic NAD(P)H response (Fig. 2A). The cytoplasmic glucose-induced NAD(P)H response reached near-maximal intensities within 80 s and was sustained throughout the experiment. The mitochondrial glucose-induced NAD(P)H response also increased dramatically above 4 mm glucose (Fig. 2C). At all concentrations studied above 4 mm glucose (8–20 mm), the mitochondrial response was saturated inducing final NAD(P)H levels in a range of ∼400 μm. Pyruvate caused a decrease in cytoplasmic NAD(P)H at concentrations from 2 to 8 mm (Fig. 2B). Above 8 mm, pyruvate caused dramatic increases in cytoplasmic NAD(P)H within 80 s, and these increases remained stable at 270 s. Mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels were not changed significantly by 2–8 mm pyruvate although a slight increase was observed with 8 mm pyruvate at 270 s. Above 8 mmpyruvate, we observed significant increases in mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels within 80 s, but the responses were transient and thus greatly diminished at 270 s. Therefore, pyruvate, above a threshold concentration of approximately ∼8 mm, induced large cytoplasmic and mitochondrial NAD(P)H increases with a transient response in the mitochondria. To further clarify the fate of pyruvate, we measured lactic acid production from pancreatic islets. When exposed to 2 mmpyruvate islets produced 0.46 ± 0.09 nmol/islet/h of lactic acid, which was slightly larger than when exposed to 2 mm glucose (0.25 ± 0.13 nmol/islet/h). In contrast, 20 mmpyruvate caused a significant increase in the amount of lactic acid produced (2.44 ± 0.19 nmol/islet/h). In these studies, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic NAD(P)H responses to 20 mm glucose or 20 mm pyruvate were followed over time (Fig. 3). Islets were divided into 4 groups, no pretreatment or pretreated with αCHC (a mitochondrial pyruvate transport inhibitor), AOA (a malate-aspartate shuttle inhibitor), or both of these inhibitors. Previous studies in pancreatic islets have shown that αCHC inhibits the oxidation of glucose and pyruvate in pancreatic islets without affecting glycolysis (16Best L. Tomlinson S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1988; 37: 2019-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and that AOA does not inhibit glycolysis or glucose oxidation (10Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The time-resolved cytoplasmic (Fig. 3, A and B) and mitochondrial responses (Fig. 3, C and D) are shown for both glucose (Fig. 3, A and C) and pyruvate (Fig. 3, B and D) stimulation. The glucose-induced cytoplasmic NAD(P)H response in αCHC- and AOA-treated islets (Fig.3A, 35–95 μm within 30 s) was similar to the response in non-treated islets but was slightly decreased when these inhibitors were used in combination. The glucose-induced mitochondrial response (Fig. 3C) showed a rapid increase in NAD(P)H (<50 s) from 260 to 430 μm. This concentration increased further to 530 μm by 250 s. Treating the islets with αCHC slowed the overall rate of mitochondrial increase but only slightly lowered the final concentration (520 μm). The mitochondrial NAD(P)H response of AOA-treated islets was also slowed in comparison to non-treated islets, but AOA treatment also lowered the maximal mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels (400 μm at 250 s). Therefore, αCHC and AOA both slowed the rate of mitochondrial NAD(P)H increase, which indicates that early in the metabolism of glucose both the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glycolysis contribute to this rise. In contrast, the equilibrium concentration decreased with AOA only, indicating that glycolysis determines the later mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels. The pyruvate-induced cytoplasmic response reached a maximum of 80 μm within 40 s, and this response was stable beyond 250 s (Fig.3B). αCHC treatment increased the cytoplasmic response dramatically (105 μm within 100 s), but this increase was transient and equilibrated to 85 μm. AOA treatment also increased the pyruvate-induced response dramatically (120 μm within 100 s), but this increase was stable beyond 250 s. Islets treated with both αCHC and AOA showed cytoplasmic responses similar to those from non-treated islets. The pyruvate-induced mitochondrial response showed a rapid increase in NAD(P)H (<20 s) to 475 μm (Fig. 3D). This concentration dropped after 150 s. Treating the islets with αCHC slowed the NAD(P)H response (>100 s) without changing the equilibrium levels, effectively removing the transient nature of pyruvate metabolism. AOA treatment also slowed the mitochondrial NAD(P)H response from 20 to 70s, but unlike non-treated islets, this large increase was stable beyond 250 s. The mitochondrial response was completely abolished during combined inhibitor treatment. Therefore, both mitochondrial pyruvate transport and the malate-aspartate shuttle contribute to the initial rate of NAD(P)H increase. The equilibrium NAD(P)H concentration in αCHC-treated islets was similar to non-treated islets, whereas NAD(P)H was decreased in AOA-treated islets. In all cases, pyruvate stimulation caused lower maximal mitochondrial concentrations than glucose (475 versus 530 μm), and this increase was transient in all but the AOA-treated islets. Glucose- and pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretions were examined in the presence or absence of inhibitors (Fig.4). Initial glucose stimulation was given to ensure the health of the islets in each study as assessed by insulin secretion levels (data not shown). The islets were equilibrated at low glucose with each inhibitor for 15 min prior to stimulation, and no increase in base-line insulin secretion was observed in any of the experiments. GSIS was significantly larger with αCHC-treated pancreatic islets than with non-treated islets (20 mmglucose + αCHC versus 20 mm glucose, p < 0.05, Student's t test). In contrast, GSIS was decreased with AOA-treated pancreatic islets (20 mm glucose + AOA versus 20 mmglucose, p < 0.05) and abolished with both inhibitors (20 mm glucose + both inhibitors). As expected, pyruvate did not stimulate insulin secretion from these islets (20 mm glucose versus 20 mm pyruvate). Pyruvate stimulation of αCHC-treated islets also caused no significant insulin secretion response. Interestingly, pyruvate stimulated a significant insulin secretion from AOA-treated islets (20 mm pyruvate + AOA versus 2.8 mmglucose, p < 0.01). This response was smaller than observed with GSIS (20 mm glucose versus 20 mm pyruvate + AOA) but comparable with levels observed with glucose-stimulated AOA-treated islets. Pyruvate stimulation with the combined inhibitor-treated islets sometimes caused insulin secretion (2 of 3 experiments). When this response was observed however, itdid not decrease upon removal of pyruvate. In addition, the insulin release was not peaked as seen for the other traces but was more of a slow rise in secretion. This increased base line is suggestive of inhibitor toxicity rather than pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion. The failure of pyruvate to stimulate insulin secretion, despite its ability to potentiate GSIS, has not been adequately explained (5Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar,6Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we measured cellular metabolic fluxes and both glucose- and pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion. Two-photon excitation microscopy of NAD(P)H allowed us to examine glucose- and pyruvate-stimulated metabolic fluxes in both the cytoplasm and mitochondria of β-cells within intact mouse islets. These data allow for new insights about β-cell metabolism and the inability of pyruvate to induce insulin secretion. Our data combined with that from previous studies (5Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 9Dukes I.D. McIntyre M.S. Mertz R.J. Philipson L.H. Roe M.W. Spencer B. Worley III, J.F. J. Biol.

Glycolysis produces ATP, NAD(P)H, and pyruvate. However, β-cells lacking mitochondrial DNA do not exhibit GSIS (24Soejima A. Inoue K. Takai D. Kaneko M. Ishihara H. Oka Y. Hayashi J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and electron transport chain inhibition reduces glucose-stimulated Ca2+ influx (9Dukes I.D. McIntyre M.S. Mertz R.J. Philipson L.H. Roe M.W. Spencer B. Worley III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10979-10982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, glycolytically derived ATP is insufficient for K+ channel closure and insulin secretion. The necessary ATP for K+ channel closure must therefore be derived through either glycolytic NAD(P)H or metabolism of pyruvate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Cytoplasmic NAD(P)H can be shuttled into the mitochondria through the glycerophosphate or the malate-aspartate shuttles (Fig. 5A). Because pancreatic islets from mice lacking the glycerophosphate shuttle demonstrate normal GSIS until treated with AOA (10Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Terauchi Y. Sugiyama T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Yamauchi N. Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), we do not expect the glycerophosphate shuttle to play a major role in these events. Glucose-derived pyruvate can also be transported into mitochondria for tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism. Our data (Fig.3A) show that the initial glucose-stimulated mitochondrial NAD(P)H rise depends on both the malate-aspartate shuttle and mitochondrial pyruvate transport. This suggests that both shuttling of NAD(P)H into the mitochondria and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism of glycolytically produced pyruvate begin immediately (Fig.5A). The transient mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism (Fig.2D and 3C) and the malate-apartate shuttle dependence of glucose-stimulated mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels (Fig.3A) indicate that pyruvate metabolism by the tricarboxylic acid cycle slows with time. In contrast, cytoplasmic NAD(P)H remains elevated during glucose stimulation suggesting that glycolysis continues to metabolize glucose. GSIS depends on the malate-aspartate shuttle but is stimulated by blocking mitochondrial pyruvate transport (Fig. 4). Therefore, it is likely that glycolytic NAD(P)H continues to supply electrons to the electron transport chain through the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerophosphate shuttle during glucose stimulation. This continuing supply of electrons sustains the elevated [ATP]/[ADP] ratio, which in turn continues stimulating Ca2+ influx and insulin secretion. Contrary to previously proposed models of pyruvate not entering β-cells (12Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S. MacDonald M.J. Wollheim C.B.

Kubota N. Murayama S. Aizawa T. Akanuma Y. Aizawa S. Kasai H. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. Science. 1999; 283: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), our data clearly demonstrate that pyruvate enters β-cells and is rapidly metabolized in the mitochondria. However, pyruvate-stimulated changes in metabolic flux are transient, which indicates that pyruvate alone is insufficient to sustain tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism. Low pyruvate concentrations caused a decrease in cytoplasmic NAD(P)H levels (Figs. 1 and 2C). There are many possible explanations of this effect, which we cannot rule out at this time. Despite the very low lactate dehydrogenase activity (11Schuit F., De Vos A. Farfari S. Moens K. Pipeleers D. Brun T. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18572-18579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 12Sekine N. Cirulli V. Regazzi R. Brown L.J. Gine E. Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Girotti M. Marie S.

Invest. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in β-cells, the presence of pyruvate-induced lactic acid shows that pyruvate may be converted to lactate, thus lowering NAD(P)H levels. Another possible explanation is that the stability of NAD(P)H is decreased at lower pH. Addition of pyruvate, a weak acid that lowers cellular pH, could decrease NAD(P)H levels by destabilizing the reduced form of the molecule. Regardless of the mechanism of the NAD(P)H decrease, the observed redox change shows that pyruvate enters the cells even at low concentrations. Cytoplasmic NAD(P)H was increased in response to pyruvate only at concentrations that caused a mitochondrial increase (Fig. 2, B and D), and the temporal cytoplasmic response reaches maximal levels only after maximal levels are obtained in the mitochondria (Fig. 3, B versus D). Our results also suggest that cytoplasmic response to pyruvate is dependent on mitochondrial metabolism. This mitochondrial metabolism is likely to include pyruvate/malate cycling (22Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2708-2713Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 25MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20051-20058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reversal of the malate-aspartate shuttle (Fig. 5B), although neither of these occurs to a large extent because the pyruvate-induced cytoplasmic NAD(P)H level was significantly smaller than glucose-induced levels (Fig. 3, A versus B, 80 versus 95 μm). Therefore, with the transient pyruvate-induced NAD(P)H response and malate-aspartate shuttle reversal, few electrons are available to the electron transport chain at later time points for ATP production. Because pyruvate enters β-cells, the transient nature of the mitochondrial response to pyruvate must result from the inhibition of either mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism or transport. Increased NADH and ATP can allosterically inhibit various tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, including NADH inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and ATP inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (26Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1993Google Scholar). This negative feedback mechanism describes the glucose-stimulated NAD(P)H and insulin secretion data but does not clearly explain why expression of hamster MCT1 in rat pancreatic islets (13Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and treatment of islets with AOA would cause pyruvate to become a secretagogue. Alternatively, pyruvate is symported into the mitochondria with a proton, and this transport depends on the pH gradient across the mitochondrial membrane (27Denton R.M. Halestrap A.P. Essays Biochem. 1979; 15: 37-77PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose metabolism increases cytoplasmic pH due to tricarboxylic acid metabolism (28Shepherd R.M. Gilon P. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 29Juntti-Berggren L. Civelek V.N. Berggren P.O. Schultz V. Corkey B.E. Tornheim K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14391-14395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which could inhibit mitochondrial pyruvate transport. During pyruvate metabolism, non-facilitated diffusion into the cell temporarily decreases cytoplasmic pH until equilibrium is achieved. The combination of pyruvate equilibration across the membrane and its metabolism in the tricarboxylic acid cycle would increase cytoplasmic pH and could therefore inhibit mitochondrial pyruvate transport. This mechanism can also explain the pyruvate-stimulated insulin secretion in MCT1-expressing islets (13Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and AOA-treated pancreatic islets. MCT1 also co-transports a proton resulting in a prolonged pyruvate-induced pH decrease in MCT1-expressing pancreatic islets (13Ishihara H. Wang H. Drewes L.R. Wollheim C.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1621-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in MCT1-expressing pancreatic islets decreases in cytoplasmic pH are likely to stimulate further membrane pyruvate transport and proton influx. Inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle by AOA (Fig.5C) could lead to a buildup of cytoplasmic malate and promote completion of the pyruvate/malate cycle. Completion of this cycle increases cytoplasmic NAD(P)H and protons, providing the necessary precursors for mitochondrial pyruvate transport. Our evidence supports this model because AOA treatment allowed pyruvate stimulation to cause both a stable mitochondrial NAD(P)H increase (Fig.3D) and insulin secretion (Fig. 4). It should be noted that both the mitochondrial and insulin responses were lower than the normal glucose-stimulated responses. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider that both the negative feedback and pH mechanisms are involved in the slowed tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolism because they are not mutually exclusive."
https://openalex.org/W2062178312,"Proteins are vulnerable to spontaneous, covalent modifications that may result in alterations to structure and function. Asparagines are particularly labile, able to undergo deamidation through the formation of a succinimide intermediate to produce either aspartate or isoaspartate residues. Although aspartates cannot undergo deamidation they can form a succinimide and result in the same products. Isoaspartyls are the principal product of succinimide hydrolysis, accounting for 65–85% of the emerging residues. The variability in the ratio of products emerging from succinimide hydrolysis suggests the ability of protein structure to influence succinimide outcome. In the H15D histidine-containing protein (HPr), phosphorylation of the active site aspartate catalyzes the formation of a cyclic intermediate. Resolution of this species is exclusively to aspartate residues, suggestive of either a succinimide with restrained hydrolysis, or an isoimide, from which aspartyl residues are the only possible product. Deletion of the C-terminal residue of this protein does not influence the ability for phosphorylation or ring formation, but it does allow for isoaspartyl formation, verifying a succinimide as the cyclic intermediate in H15D HPr. Isoaspartyl formation in H15D Δ85 is rationalized to occur as a consequence of elimination of steric restrictions imposed by the C terminus on the main-chain carbonyl of the succinimide, the required point of nucleophilic attack of a water molecule for isoaspartyl formation. This is the first reported demonstration of the influence of protein structure on the products emerging from succinimide hydrolysis."

We investigated the significance of carbohydrate 6-sulfation and tyrosine sulfation in selectin-mediated cell adhesion.

Previously we proposed that the L-selectin ligand on human high endothelial venules (HEV)1 to be sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X by both precisely comparing the fine specificity of anti-carbohydrate antibodies reactive to human HEVs (16Mitsuoka C.

This enabled the reconstitution of functional L-selectin ligands on cultured cell lines such as ECV304 by co-transfecting cDNAs for 6-Sul-T and α1→3 fucosyltransferase VII (Fuc-T VII) (20Kimura N.

In such reconstitution experiments, co-transfection of Fuc-T VII and 6-Sul-T cDNAs conferred significant binding of L-selectin, while E-selectin was noted to require only Fuc-T VII for expression of its ligands. In contrast, the introduction of Fuc-T VII and 6-Sul-T cDNAs did not seem to be sufficient for synthesis of functional ligands for P-selectin (20Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N.

P-selectin is known to specifically require sulfation of tyrosine residues located at the NH2-terminal region of PSGl-1 (22Sako D. Chang X.-J. Barone K.M. Vachino G. White H.M. Shaw G. Veldman G.M.

Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), but the influence of carbohydrate 6-sulfation of the ligand molecule on P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion has not been studied. This prompted us to carefully compare the effect of tyrosine sulfation and carbohydrate 6-sulfation on P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. In addition to leukocyte-endothelial interactions, L-selectin is proposed to contribute to leukocyte-leukocyte interactions (31Bargatze R.F. Kurk S. Butcher E.C. Jutila M.A. J. Exp.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In this context, recent reports have suggested that the ligand specificity of L-selectin is similar to that of P-selectin and that PSGL-1 also serves as a L-selectin ligand by utilizing both the carbohydrate determinants and the three tyrosine sulfate residues at the extreme NH2-terminal region of PSGL-1 (33Spertini O.

Transfection of cells with cDNA for PSGL-1 together with that for fucosyltransferases is reported to confer binding activity for L-selectin, even without any exogenous introduction of 6-Sul-T cDNA (37Snapp K.R.

This implies that tyrosine sulfation may substitute for carbohydrate 6-sulfation in L-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. Another possibility is that the cells used in the cell adhesion assays expressed endogenous 6-Sul-T. The relative importance of tyrosine sulfation versus carbohydrate 6-sulfation of PSGL-1 in L-selectin-mediated cell adhesion thus remains to be fully determined. For instance, treatment of cells with chlorate, which was sometimes employed in earlier experiments to inhibit tyrosine sulfation of PSGL-1, also abolishes carbohydrate 6-sulfation. In this study, we evaluated the relative contribution of carbohydrate 6-sulfation and the tyrosine sulfation of PSGL-1 on cell adhesion mediated by selectins using monolayer cell adhesion assays and rolling assays under shear flow. We employed two different approaches. One was to use cells expressing a mutated form of PSGL-1, indicated as the FFFE mutant of PSGL-1. In this mutant, the three tyrosine residues essential for the recognition by P-selectin were replaced by phenylalanine residues at the NH2-terminal region of PSGL-1 (24Pouyani T. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 83: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 37Snapp K.R. Ding H. Atkins K. Warnke R. Luscinskas F.W. Kansas G.S. Blood. 1998; 91: 154-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This is known to nearly completely abrogate P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. We then generated stable transfectant cells expressing either intact PSGL-1 or its FFFE-mutant, with various combinations of co-transfection with Fuc-T VII and/or 6-Sul-T cDNAs. The other approach was mocarhagin treatment of the cells. Mocarhagin is a metalloproteinase known to specifically remove the NH2-terminal 10 amino acids of the mature form of PSGL-1, which includes the three potential sulfated tyrosine residues, thus specifically inhibiting P-selectin-mediated cell adhesion (42Levesque J.P.

The mAbs used in these studies were as follows: G72, recognizing anti-6-sulfo LacNAc, and G152, directed to sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X (both murine IgM), were prepared as described previously (20Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4530-4535Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CSLEX-1, a classical anti-sialyl Lewis X antibody (murine IgM), was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The anti-PSGL-1 antibodies, PL1, PL2 (both murine IgG1 from Immunotech), and KPL1 (murine IgG1, BD PharMingen, Mountain View, CA), and an anti-CD34 antibody, clone QBEnd 10 (murine IgG1, Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo), were commercially obtained. Flow cytometric analysis was performed using FACScan (BD PharMingen). The cells were harvested at a semiconfluent stage and stained with the respective, purified monoclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml or culture supernatant at a dilution of 1:10 at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and stained with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (Silenus Laboratories) at 4 °C for 30 min.

The parent COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. To obtain stable transfectants, 5 × 106 cells were transfected with 10 μg of the expression vectors containing each cDNA using LipofectAMINE PLUSTM reagent and selected in medium containing selection marker, G418 (400 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for pRC/CMV, hygromycin (700 μg/ml, Wako) for pIRES1hyg, and Zeocin (400 μg/ml, Invitrogen) for pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+). Clones strongly expressing cDNA-related products on the cell surface were obtained by using a magnetic cell sorting system (VarioMACS, Miltenyi Biotec), followed by limiting dilution. The stable transfectant cells expressing Fuc-T VII or 6-Sul-T only, and the cells expressing both Fuc-T VII and 6-Sul-T, are indicated as 7/COS-7, 6/COS-7, and 7,6/COS-7, respectively. The stable transfectant cells of PSGL-1, FFFE-PSGL-1 mutant, and CD34 derived from 7/COS-7 or 7,6/COS-7 cells are designated as PSGL-1/7, PSGL-1/7,6, FFFE/7, FFFE/7,6, CD34/7, and CD34/7,6 cells, respectively. In vitro non-static monolayer cell adhesion assays were performed as described previously (20Kimura N. Mitsuoka C. Kanamori A. Hiraiwa N. Uchimura K. Muramatsu T. Tamatani T. Kansas G.S. Kannagi R.

After the addition of BCECF-AM-labeled selectin transfectant of cultured murine B lymphoma cells (300.19/L, 300.19/P, or 300.19/E, 8 × 105 cells/0.5 ml/well) (46Kansas G.S. Ley K. Munro J.M.

Non-adherent cells were washed out three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing Ca2+ and Mg2+, the cells were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the attached cells were counted by measuring fluorescence using an Arvo 1420 multilabel counter (Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD). Rolling assays for COS-7 transfectant cells were performed using the flow chamber of Lawrenceet al. (47Lawrence M.B. McIntire L.V. Eskin S.G.

The transfectant cells grown on a microscope slide served as the rolling substrate. The flow chamber was mounted on the stage of an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Olympus Products, Tokyo, model IX70). The 300.19 cells expressing each selectin were introduced into the flow chamber at a concentration of 5 × 105/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. The shear stress in the flow chamber was controlled using a syringe pump (model 944, Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA). The number of attached cells and mean rolling velocity were determined from digital images recorded with a Model CS-220 video camera system (Olympus). The flow chambers were maintained at 37 °C with an air-curtain incubator (Olympus Products, model IX-IBM) throughout the experiments. The wall shear stress (T) was calculated from the equation, T = 3μQ/2a2b, where μ = coefficient of viscosity (1.0 cP), Q = volumetric flow rate (0.022 cm3/s), 2a = channel height (1.6 × 10−2 cm), and b = channel width (1.3 cm).

COS-7 cells and derived transfectants were analyzed for the expression of sialyl Lewis X-related carbohydrate determinants by flow cytometric analysis (Fig.1). The G152 antibody, which is specific to sialyl 6-sulfo Lewis X, the product of the concerted enzymatic action of Fuc-T VII and 6-Sul-T (17Mitsuoka C. Sawada-Kasugai M. Ando-Furui K. Izawa M.

The sialyl Lewis X determinant defined by the CSLEX-1 antibody was found on both Fuc-T VII single transfectants (7/COS-7) and double transfectants (7,6/COS-7). Its expression tended to be weaker in the double transfectant cells than in the Fuc-T VII single transfectant cells as indicated in Fig. 1. The 300.19/L cells adhered only to the 7,6/COS-7 cells and did not adhere to the 7/COS-7, 6/COS-7, and parental COS-7 cells in monolayer cell adhesion assays (Fig.2A). The same specificity was noted in the rolling of 300.19/L cells on the transfectant cells under shear flow (Fig. 2B). Significant rolling of 300.19/L cells was observed only on 7,6/COS-7, but not on 7/COS-7 cells (Fig.2B).

https://openalex.org/W2112336352,"Haemophilus influenzae NadR protein (hiNadR) has been shown to be a bifunctional enzyme possessing both NMN adenylytransferase (NMNAT; EC 2.7.7.1) and ribosylnicotinamide kinase (RNK; EC 2.7.1.22) activities. Its function is essential for the growth and survival of H. influenzae and thus may present a new highly specific anti-infectious drug target. We have solved the crystal structure ofhiNadR complexed with NAD using the selenomethionine MAD phasing method. The structure reveals the presence of two distinct domains. The N-terminal domain that hosts the NMNAT activity is closely related to archaeal NMNAT, whereas the C-terminal domain, which has been experimentally demonstrated to possess ribosylnicotinamide kinase activity, is structurally similar to yeast thymidylate kinase and several other P-loop-containing kinases. There appears to be no cross-talk between the two active sites. The bound NAD at the active site of the NMNAT domain reveals several critical interactions between NAD and the protein. There is also a second non-active-site NAD molecule associated with the C-terminal RNK domain that adopts a highly folded conformation with the nicotinamide ring stacking over the adenine base.

Two enzymatic steps are required to convert ribosylnicotinamide to NAD in the cytoplasm: a ribosylnicotinamide kinase (RNK; EC 2.7.1.22) to catalyze the phosphorylation of nicotinamide riboside to produce NMN and a NMN adenylyltransferase (NMNAT; EC 2.7.7.1) to link NMN and the AMP moiety of ATP to generate NAD. Whereas the gene encoding RNK has not been identified in any organism until very recently, 2O. V. Kurnasov, B. M. Polanuyer, S. Ananta, R. Sloutsky, A. Tam, S. Y. Gerdes, A. L.

We will use pyridine nucleotide adenylyltransferase (PNAT) as a generic name for both NMNAT and NaMNAT as well as for enzymes with dual specificities, such as in the case of human NMN/NaMNAT. The three-dimensional structures of PNATs and their complexes with substrate/product have been solved from several sources, includingMethanococcus jannaschii (7D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V.

Since PNATs catalyze the indispensable central step in NAD biosynthesis and recycling, genes encoding these activities have been found in almost all organisms with completely sequenced genomes. In H. influenzae, the ortholog of bacterial NaMNAT (NadD gene product) is lacking, and the alternative housekeeping PNAT function is encoded in the N-terminal domain of the bifunctional NadR protein,2 which shares 54% identity to the E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium NadR proteins. The multifunctional NadR proteins contain the signature nucleotidyltransferase (H/T)IGH motif, and its NMNAT activity has been confirmed experimentally in the E. coli enzyme (14Raffaelli N. Lorenzi T. Mariani P.L. Emanuelli M. Amici A. Ruggieri S. Magni G. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5509-5511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, more recently, in H. influenzae and S. typhimurium as well.2 In addition to the NMNAT activity, NadR in S. typhimurium and E. colicontain a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix motif N-terminal to the NMNAT domain. The S. typhimurium NadR has long been demonstrated to be a NAD-dependent repressor for the transcription of genes involved in both de novo biosynthesis (nadBand nadA) and niacin salvage (pncB) (15Foster J.W. Holley-Guthrie E.A. Warren F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Penfound T. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 648-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also suggested that NadR may interact with an integral membrane transporter PnuC protein and directly participate in the uptake of exogenous NAD precursors (17Zhu N. Olivera B.M. Roth J.R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 1311-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H. influenzae NadR lacks the helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain, which correlates with the absence of any genes of de novo NAD biosynthesis or niacin salvage in this organism. Recently, we have predicted and experimentally verified that previously uncharacterized RNK activity resides within the C-terminal domain of NadR. The essentiality of NadR for the growth and survival of H. influenzae has also been established.2 Here we report the crystal structure of H. influenzae NadR protein (hiNadR) complexed with NAD. This structure reveals that whereas the NMNAT domain is mostly similar to the archaeal NMNAT, the C-terminal RNK domain is structurally similar to the yeast thymidylate kinase and several other P-loop-containing nucleotide and nucleoside kinases. The cloning, expression, and purification of hiNadR protein is described elsewhere.2 Briefly, the gene encoding residues 52–421 of sequence NADR_HAEIN (gi‖1171638) was PCR-amplified from H. influenzae genomic DNA and was cloned into a pET-derived vector containing a T7 promoter, His6 tag, and TEV protease cleavage site (gift from Dr. Meg Philips, UT Southwestern Medical Center). The resulting plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen) for expression. The overexpressed hiNadR protein was first purified with a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) column, followed by a Superdex 200 gel filtration column (AmershamBiosciences). The selenomethionine hiNadR was expressed in the met− auxotrophic strain B834(DE3) (Novagen), grown in minimal medium supplemented with selenomethionine and other nutrients (18Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), and purified using the same procedure as the native protein. The hiNadR crystals were grown at 20 °C using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. 10 mg/ml hiNadR in 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 0.3 m NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was first incubated with 3 mm of NAD and 3 mm of ATP and then mixed with an equal volume of the reservoir solution (0.1m MES, pH 6.0, 1.0 m ammonia sulfate) and equilibrated against the reservoir. Large diamond-shaped crystals appeared after 2–7 days. These hiNadR co-crystals belong to a hexagonal crystal system with cell dimensions a =b = 106.9 Å, c = 174.9 Å.α = β = 90°, andγ = 120°. The exact space group of these crystals was later determined to be P6422. There is onehiNadR molecule in the asymmetric unit. These crystals diffract to 3.0-Å resolution on a rotating anode x-ray generator and about 2.7 Å at synchrotron. The selenomethionine hiNadR crystals were grown at similar conditions and are of same quality as the native crystals. For data collection at 100 K, crystals were transferred stepwise to a cryoprotection solution containing all components of the reservoir and additional 30% ethylene glycol. A 3.3-Å resolution multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data set and a 2.9-Å resolution native data set were collected at beamline X12B (National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory). All diffraction data were processed and scaled with the HKL2000 package (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

The initial phases of thehiNadR crystal structure were solved by the multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing method using SOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Six selenium sites out of a total of eight were located, and the resulting phases have a figure of merit of 0.64. Density modification was performed with RESOLVE (21Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar), which resulted in a clearly interpretable electron density map. The hiNadR polypeptide chain was manually built into this map using O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). The refinement of hiNadR structure was carried out using CNS (23Bru¨nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) with simulated annealing protocol. The first round of refinement resulted in an Rwork of 32.5% andRfree of 38.2%. Several rounds of manual rebuilding and refinements improved the R factors to a value of 27.3% for the Rwork and 33.9% for theRfree. At this point, densities for two NAD molecules became evident: one at the active site of the NMNAT domain and the other associated with the C-terminal RNK domain but not in its active site. The starting coordinates for the NAD at the active site of the NMNAT domain were derived from the coordinates of NAD in theM. thermoautotrophicum NMNAT·NAD complex structure (8Saridakis V. Christendat D. Kimber M.S. Dharamsi A. Edwards A.M. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7225-7232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The second NAD molecule adopts a highly compact conformation with the nicotinamide ring stacking over the adenine base. The model for this NAD molecule was built manually to fit the density, and its conformation was optimized with CNS (23Bru¨nger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. Cryst. Chem. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Several putative sulfate molecules were also included in the subsequent rounds of refinement. Further rounds of refinement with these ligands included in the model resulted in a decrease in Rwork to 23.6% andRfree to 29.8%. The current refinement statistics are listed in Table I. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge and using both scanning absorption and Rayleigh interference optics. Wavelengths used were 295 nm in the absorbance mode and 675 nm for Rayleigh interference. We used an An-60Ti rotor with double sector cells of 1.2-cm path length at 4 °C for all experiments. The sedimentation equilibrium was carried out at 9,000 r.p.m. and 13,000 r.p.m. Two different concentrations of the protein (1.2 and 0.4 mg/ml) dissolved in 100 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA were used in the study. All centrifugation data were analyzed with the OptimaTM data analysis software. The overexpressed recombinant hiNadR protein contains residues 52–421 of the NADR_HAEIN sequence (total of 370 amino acids), which includes the NMNAT and RNK domains. We chose to carry out crystallographic study of this segment, since the multiple alignment of all NadR homologs has shown that the reliable sequence similarity between hiNadR and other NadR homologs starts only from the NMNAT domain. Overexpression of the extended version of hiNadR containing an N-terminal His6 tag fused at position Met15results in two protein products, suggesting an alternative translation initiation at Met52.2 This possibility is further strengthened by the fact that it is more consistent with the predicted starts of NadR homologs in several other species, such asMycobacterium tuberculosis (gi‖92220269), Nostoc punctiforme (gi‖91112614), and Lactococcus lactis(gi‖15673969). The N-terminally truncated version ofhiNadR (residues 52–421) possesses full NMNAT and RNK activities and is functionally indistinguishable from the full-length protein.2 The current crystal structure model of hiNadR contains residues 57–345 and 357–411 (among the expressed segment 52–421). The first 5 residues along with the N-terminal His6 tag region, a loop containing residues 346–356, and the last 10 residues at the C terminus are disordered in the crystal structure. Additionally, there are two NAD and five sulfate molecules that are included in the model. Although 3 mm ATP was present in the crystallization solution, no ATP molecule could be located in the density map; therefore, the current structure must be discussed as ahiNadR·NAD complex. The structure of the hiNadR monomer revealed the presence of two distinct domains connected by a loop (Fig.1). The N-terminal NMNAT domain (residues 52–224) adopts a Rossmann-like three-layered α/β/α fold with the central five-stranded parallel β-sheet having the strand order 32145. The structure of this domain closely resembles archaeal NMNATs (7D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Struct. Fold.

The C-terminal RNK domain (residues 225–421) also adopts a three-layered α/β/α fold with a five-stranded central parallel β-sheet of strand order 23145. Note that the strand order in the central β-sheet of the C-terminal RNK domain differs from that in the NMNAT domain. Search of the protein structure data base (PDB) using DALI (24Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) revealed that the RNK domain is structurally similar to several typical P-loop kinases, such as yeast thymidylate kinase (Protein Data Bank code 3tmk, Z score of 14.8, r.m.s. deviation of 3.1 Å over 164 C-α atoms), Bacillus stearothermophilus adenylate kinase (Protein Data Bank code 1zin,Z score of 10.3, r.m.s. deviation of 3.2 Å over 136 C-α atoms), and herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (Protein Data Bank code 1qhi, Z score of 8.3, r.m.s. deviation of 3.3 Å over 146 C-α atoms). Superpositions of hiNadR with archaeal NMNAT and yeast thymidylate kinase are shown in Fig.2.Figure 2Comparison of hiNadR with archaeal NMNAT and TMK. a, superposition of the C-α trace of hiNadR NMNAT domain (dark blue) with mthNMNAT (1EJ2) (dark red). b, superposition of the C-α trace ofhiNadR RNK domain (blue) with yeast TMK (3TMK) (red). c, structure-based alignment ofhiNadR with mthNMNAT and yeast TMK.

To investigate the oligomeric status of the protein in solution, we performed analytical ultracentrifugation studies at two different hiNadR concentrations (1.2 mg/ml and 0.4 mg/ml) and two different speeds (9,000 and 13,000 r.p.m.). The apparent molecular masses obtained are 170 kDa (1.2 mg/ml) and 150 kDa (0.4 mg/ml), which are somewhat lower than the calculated molecular mass of hiNadR tetramer (180 kDa), indicating the presence of lower molecular weight species. The data collected at the two different protein concentrations and two different speeds allow us to fit either a dimer/tetramer or a monomer/tetramer model for hiNadR, both of which yielded dissociation constants in the low micromolar range (KD of 1–10 μm for the dimer-tetramer model, data not shown). This indicates that tetramer is the major oligomerization species of hiNadR in solution at higher than micromolar concentrations. The hiNadR tetramer in crystal displays a 222 symmetry. Two distinct types of interfaces between individual monomers are observed in the tetramer. Monomers A and B (or C and D) form a “handshake-like” association that buries 1384 Å2 of surface area per monomer at the interface. The C-terminal RNK domain from one monomer sits snugly in a hinge grove between the two domains of the second monomer, making extensive contacts with both domains of the second monomer (Fig. 3a). The other type of dimer interface is between monomers A and D (or B and C) and is less extensive, burying a surface area of only 894 Å2 per monomer. The resulting tetramer has the appearance of a closed barrel with the hinge between the two domains of each monomer located at the middle of the barrel. This creates a cavity at the center of the barrel with a diameter of ∼18 Å. A narrow channel extends from this central cavity and runs through the whole length of the tetramer, exiting between the less densely packed dimer (Fig. 3b). The electrostatic potential mapped on the surface of the tetramer revealed a strikingly positively charged cluster in the middle and along the central channel of the barrel (Fig. 3c). Amino acids Lys215, Lys219, Arg222, His296, His298, and Lys299 from each of the four monomers contribute to this positively charged patch, which is located at the interface between monomers in the tetramer. It was thus not surprising that several sulfate molecules were found in this region. The active sites of both NMNAT and RNK domains are located on the outside of the barrel, facing away from the central cavity (Fig.3). Four non-active-site-bound NAD molecules associated with the C-terminal RNK domains of the four hiNadR monomers were found aggregated inside the central cavity of the tetramer (Fig. 3). Each of these NAD molecules adopts a highly folded conformation with the nicotinamide ring stacked over the adenine base in a nearly parallel fashion (Fig.4a). The distance between the adenine C-6 and nicotinamide C-2 atoms, which has been used in the literature as a general measure of compactness of the bound NAD(P) (25Bell C.E. Yeates T.O. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2084-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is 4.2 Å for this NAD molecule. Whereas most of the enzyme-bound NAD molecules adopt extended conformation such as the one bound in the active site of NMNAT domain of hiNadR, there is only one other example of enzyme-bound NAD that adopts a similarly highly folded conformation. In the crystal structure of flavin reductase P complexed with its inhibitor NAD, the NAD molecule adopts a compact conformation with a distance between adenine C-6 and nicotinamide C-2 atoms of 3.9 Å (26Tanner J.J., Tu, S.C. Barbour L.J. Barnes C.L. Krause K.L. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, the conformation of the flavin reductase P-bound NAD differs drastically from the second NAD in the hiNadR·NAD complex structure (Fig. 4b), reflecting the remarkable flexibility of NAD molecule. Notably, nuclear magnetic resonance studies and molecular dynamics simulation have indicated that, in contrast to the protein-bound forms, NAD in aqueous and some organic solutions adopts compact folded conformations in which the distance between the nicotinamide and adenine rings is 4–5 Å (27Sarma R.H. Ross V. Kaplan N.O. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3052-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 28Smith P.E. Tanner J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 8637-8644Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There are several specific interactions between the non-active-site NAD molecule andhiNadR tetramer. The adenine and nicotinamide rings are sandwiched between the side chains of Tyr292 and Trp256 (Fig. 4a). The pyrophosphate moiety of the NAD points outward and is in contact with the Lys126side chain of an adjacent monomer in the tetramer. Additionally, the oxygen of the nicotinamide carboxyamide group is within the hydrogen bonding range of the main chain amide of Trp256, and the N-6 of the adenine appears to be in contact with main chain carbonyl of Tyr289. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that binding of the non-active-site NAD molecule is a crystallization artifact, the specific interactions between this NAD molecule andhiNadR tetramer indicate that it may have biological implications. In E. coli and S. typhimurium, the NadR protein represses three genes involved in NAD biosynthesis in a NAD-dependent manner (15Foster J.W. Holley-Guthrie E.A. Warren F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 279-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 16Penfound T. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 648-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the NAD molecule as an effector may bind to a site different from the active site of NMNAT domain. Binding of the NAD effector at this regulatory site presumably induces a conformational change and leads to the binding of NadR to operator DNA. It is thus tempting to speculate that the second nonactive NAD binding site in hiNadR may represent the NAD effector binding site in E. coli andS. typhimurium NadR. Although hiNadR do not possess repressor function, the sequence identities between the NMNAT and RNK domains of hiNadR and that of E. coliNadR and S. typhimurium NadR are high (∼54%). Therefore,hiNadR must have retained many structural and functional features of E. coli NadR and S. typhimurium NadR. More biochemical and structural studies are needed to investigate this hypothesis. The NAD molecule that was found in the active site of the N-terminal NMNAT domain of hiNadR adopts an extended conformation similar to that bound to the mthNMNAT (8Saridakis V. Christendat D. Kimber M.S. Dharamsi A. Edwards A.M. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7225-7232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig.5). The adenine nucleotide binding site includes the (H/T)IGH motif, the preceding loop between the (H/T)IGH motif, and the end of the first β-stand, which is also highly conserved, the N terminus of α-helix E that contains the ISSTXXR motif, and a loop connecting β-strande and helix E that interacts with the adenine base. A sulfate molecule found in this active site is superimposable with that in the mthNMNAT·NAD complex (8Saridakis V. Christendat D. Kimber M.S. Dharamsi A. Edwards A.M. Pai E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7225-7232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and appears to occupy the site that would normally be occupied by the β and γ phosphates of ATP, as was shown in the structure of the M. janaschii NMNAT·ATP complex (7D'Angelo I. Raffaelli N. Dabusti V. Lorenzi T. Magni G. Rizzi M. Struct. Fold. Des. 2000; 8: 993-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Similar to the archaeal NMNATs, in hiNadR the loop connecting strand c to helix C (residues 138–149) plays a central role in the binding of the nicotinamide portion of the substrate. We therefore term this loop the “nicotinamide recognition loop.” The exocyclic carboxyamide group of the nicotinamide interacts with several main chain groups from this nicotinamide recognition loop (Fig. 5); the carboxyl group lies in close proximity to the main chain amide of Trp149, whereas the amide group is close to the main chain carbonyls of Pro143 and Ser144. Trp152, which is aligned with Trp84 in MthNMNAT, appears to play the same role in forming a stacking interaction with"

J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4743-4746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it loses the ability to cleave fibrinogen or the platelet receptors and “paradoxically” switches into an anticoagulant enzyme with increased (>1,000-fold) specificity toward protein C (2Griffin J.H. Nature. 1995; 378: 337-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Human thrombomodulin contains 557 residues and consists of five distinct domains: a 226-residue N-terminal domain with partial similarity to lectin-like molecules, a 236-residue domain containing six epidermal growth factor-like (EGF1-like) domains, a glycosylated Ser/Thr-rich domain of 34 amino acids, a transmembrane domain of 23 amino acids, and a C-terminal cytosolic tail of 38 residues (3Wen D.

The EGF-like domains 5 and 6 are essential for thrombomodulin binding to thrombin via exosite I (5Ye J. Liu L.W. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11023-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Hayashi T. Zushi M. Yamamoto S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20156-20159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some thrombomodulin molecules contain a chondroitin sulfate moiety linked to the Ser/Thr-rich domain that precedes the transmembrane domain (7Bourin M.C. Boffa M.C. Björk I. Lindahl U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5924-5928Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This moiety makes contact with thrombin at exosite II (8Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), located on the opposite pole of the molecule relative to exosite I (9Di Cera E. Cantwell A.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 936: 133-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Previous investigations of the thrombin-thrombomodulin interaction have documented a surprisingly small change in heat capacity upon formation of the complex (10Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction is a simple rigid-body association that elicits no significant conformational changes in either thrombin or thrombomodulin. Unequivocal support to this conclusion has come from the recent structural work on thrombin bound with a fragment of thrombomodulin containing EGF-like domains 4–6 (11Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Paglia R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The structure reveals extensive contacts made by thrombomodulin with exosite I of thrombin, in agreement with previous x-ray and NMR studies (12Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Tulinsky A. Sadler J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13547-13552Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 13Srinivasan J., Hu, S. Hrabal R. Zhu Y. Komives E.A. Ni F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3553-3560Google Scholar), but shows no significant structural changes in the enzyme. The structural epitope documented recently needs to be validated energetically by Ala scanning mutagenesis of the residues involved in thrombomodulin recognition. Several biological systems studied previously have shown significant differences between structural and functional epitopes (14Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Specifically, structural epitopes tend to be larger in size than functional epitopes, because the binding free energy for an interaction often resides at localized hot spots (15Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). The correct identification of the boundaries of an epitope must therefore rely on Ala scanning mutagenesis and not structural analysis alone (16Greenspan N.P. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 936-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), because it is the functional epitope that eventually defines the target for drug development and molecular mimicry (15Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). Here we report the functional epitope of thrombin recognizing thrombomodulin, as revealed by Ala scanning mutagenesis of over 50 residues of thrombin. The results reveal aspects on the energetics of thrombomodulin recognition that have a bearing on protein-protein interactions in general. Site-directed mutagenesis of human α-thrombin was carried out in a HPC4-pNUT expression vector, using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Expression of mutant and wild-type thrombin was carried out in baby hamster kidney cells as described previously (17Ayala Y.M. Rose T. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The enzyme was activated with the prothrombinase complex for 30 min at 37 °C. Some mutants required further activation with the immobilized snake venom enzyme ecarin. Activated thrombin was purified to homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography using Resource Q and S columns with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.5 m choline chloride, 5 mm MES, pH 6 at room temperature. Mutants were checked for incomplete activation and/or autolytic digestion by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Mass spectrometry yielded molecular weights consistent with the mutations introduced and indicated identical glycosylation between wild-type and mutant constructs. The active site concentration was determined by titration with hirudin and was found to be >95% in all cases. Human fibrinogen and rabbit thrombomodulin containing chondroitin sulfate were purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Rabbit thrombomodulin is functionally equivalent to the human protein containing chondroitin sulfate (10Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out under experimental conditions of 5 mm Tris, 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 145 mmNaCl, pH 7.4 at 37 °C. The interaction of thrombin with thrombomodulin was studied directly from the inhibition of fibrinopeptide A (FpA) release upon fibrinogen cleavage (10Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). First, the progress curve of FpA release was measured in the absence of competitive inhibitor to determine the value of the specificity constant kcat/Km (18Vindigni A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The point along the progress curve most sensitive to competitive inhibition is at time tc =Km/eTkcat. Then, the amount of FpA released at time tc was determined as a function of the concentration of thrombomodulin to derive the value for the Kd of binding using the equation, [FpA]=[FpA]∞1−exp−kcateTtc/Km1+[L]Kd(Eq. 1) where L stands for thrombomodulin, eT is the active thrombin concentration, kcat/Km is the specificity constant for FpA release. Equation 1 implies that thrombomodulin competitively inhibits fibrinogen binding. As in previous studies (10Vindigni A. White C.E. Komives E.A. Di Cera E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6674-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we observed no evidence of the contrary and the boundaries of the epitope for thrombomodulin binding in exosite I identified in the present study overlap completely with those of fibrinogen recognition (see “Results”). Previous site-directed mutagenesis studies on thrombin-thrombomodulin interaction have identified thrombin residues involved in thrombomodulin binding by comparing the effect of mutations on protein C activation in the presence and absence of thrombomodulin (19Tsiang M. Jain A.K. Dunn K.E. Rojas M.E. Leung L.L.K. Gibbs C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16854-16863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 20Hall S.W. Nagashima M. Zhao L. Morser J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). When the effects of a thrombin mutation that influences thrombomodulin binding are assessed from the reduction of the thrombomodulin-dependent protein C activation relative to wild-type thrombin, the results depend entirely on the thrombomodulin concentration used. A more obvious limitation of this approach is that it does not provide an energetic quantification of the effect of a thrombin mutation on thrombomodulin binding. In this study, we have chosen a direct method of determination of Kd for thrombomodulin binding to wild-type and 54 mutant thrombins, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. Of the thrombin residues mutated, only a few produce significant (>3RT) changes in the binding free energy ΔG = RTlnKd of the mutant relative to wild-type. These residues are Arg67, Lys70, Tyr76, Glu77, Glu80, and Ile82 and cluster in a hot spot of exosite I (Fig. 2). Arg67, Lys70, Glu77, and Glu80 form a buried ion quartet under the surface of the 70-loop, on top of which sit Tyr76 and Ile82. Interestingly, most of the quartet and Tyr76 are excised from exosite I upon autocatalytic cleavage at Arg77a and Arg67 that produces the derivatives β- and γ-thrombins severely compromised in fibrinogen clotting and thrombomodulin binding (21Hofsteenge J. Braun P.J. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2144-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among the regions that seem to be involved significantly in thrombomodulin binding, the domain bridging the active site and exosite I around the 30-loop contains residues of particular importance. Phe34 and Lys36 are noteworthy, as their mutation drops the affinity for thrombomodulin more than 10-fold. Neighbor residues Pro37 and Gln38 also make significant contribution to binding, unlike other residues in the region like Arg35, Ser36a, and Glu39. Residues defining the entrance to the thrombin active site, like Trp96 and Leu99, or the autolysis loop and the 186-loop show little involvement in thrombomodulin binding. In the 220-loop, containing residues involved in Na+ binding, mutation of Tyr225affects thrombomodulin binding 10-fold presumably by altering the conformation of thrombin from the fast to the slow form. In exosite II, there are a few residues that participate in thrombomodulin binding by facilitating the docking of the negatively charged moiety of the chondroitin sulfate. Exosite II contains no hydrophobic patches on its surface, unlike exosite I, and features two ion clusters of partially buried residues organized in the quartet Glu97a-Asp100-Arg101-Arg175and the triplet Arg165-Asp178-Arg233. In the first cluster, mutation of Arg101 affects thrombomodulin binding 10-fold, and Arg175 makes only a small contribution to binding. The importance of the cluster and Arg101 is demonstrated by the fact that mutation of the negatively charged residues Asp100 and Glu97a actually results in improved thrombomodulin binding. These residues partially neutralize Arg101 and reduce the electrostatic coupling of this residue with the chondroitin sulfate moiety of thrombomodulin. This effect is even more evident in the second cluster, where mutation of Asp178 increases thrombomodulin binding almost 10-fold. This residue neutralizes Arg165 and Arg233, which could otherwise interact very favorably with thrombomodulin. The neutralization effect is significant because mutation of either Arg165 or Arg233 impairs thrombomodulin binding only slightly. The results reported here compare well with and extend those reported in previous studies. The extensive Ala-scanning mutagenesis study of the Leung's group uncovered residues Lys36, Gln38, Arg67, Lys60, Arg73, Thr74, Tyr76, Arg77a, Lys81, and Lys109 as part of the epitope for thrombomodulin binding (20Hall S.W. Nagashima M. Zhao L. Morser J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our study confirms the important role of Arg67, Lys70, and Tyr76, but assigns a lesser role to Lys36, Gln38, and Arg77a, and practically no role to Arg73, Thr74, Lys81, and Lys109. Our study also rules out the importance of residue Arg75 to thrombomodulin binding suggested previously from charge reversal substitution (22Wu Q. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), but confirms the important role of the hydrophobic residues Phe34, Tyr76, and Ile82 supported by recent hydrogen/deuterium exchange experiments (23Mandell J.G. Baerga-Ortiz A. Akashi S. Takio K. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Finally, Ala mutants of Arg93, Arg97, and Arg101 have shown that Arg93 is important for heparin binding, whereas Arg97 and Arg101 play a dominant role in thrombomodulin binding (8Ye J. Rezaie A.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17965-17970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24He X., Ye, J. Esmon C.T. Rezaie A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8969-8976Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We confirm the important role of Arg101 in view of its coupling with Asp100 and Glu97a, but find no contribution of Arg97 to thrombomodulin recognition. Our study enables a direct comparison of the functional epitope for thrombomodulin binding to thrombin (red and yellow residues in Fig. 2, bottom left) with the structural epitope (red and yellow residues in Fig. 2, bottom right) recently determined by x-ray crystallography of thrombin bound to the thrombomodulin fragment containing the EGF-like domains 4–6 (11Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Paglia R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We find that the functional epitope is less extended than the structural epitope (Fig. 2), with most of the energy for thrombomodulin binding being concentrated in a hot spot defined by the residues of the buried ion-paired quartet Arg67-Lys70-Glu77-Glu80, topped by the hydrophobic residues Tyr76 and Ile82. The crystal structure shows that the thrombin-thrombomodulin interface in exosite I is dominated by hydrophobic contacts between Phe34, Ile82, and Tyr76 of thrombin, and Ile414, Leu415, Ile424, Phe432, and Thr422 of thrombomodulin (Fig.3), with a single, solvent exposed ion pair between Lys110 of thrombin and Asp461 of thrombomodulin (11Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Paglia R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The side chains of residues Ser36a, Gln38, Thr74, and Arg77a make polar contacts with thrombomodulin, and so do the backbones of residues Arg75, Tyr76, and Ile82. The important structural role of Phe34, Ile82, and Tyr76 is confirmed by our Ala-scanning mutagenesis study. However, at least for Ile82 and Tyr76, the origin of this importance stems from the integrity of the buried quartet Arg67-Lys70-Glu77-Glu80whose members do not make contact with thrombomodulin (Fig. 3). The quartet is a crucial structural component of exosite I, holding the 70-loop in a correct conformation for ligand recognition. Lys70 replaces the bound Ca2+ in the same region found in cognate proteases like trypsin or activated protein C and the other residues define a network of short range H-bonds that stabilize the 70-loop in its entirety. Interestingly, this quartet defines most of the binding epitopes of fibrinogen, fibrin, and PAR1 in exosite I (17Ayala Y.M. Rose T. Cantwell A.M. Bush L.A. Arosio D. Di Cera E. Proteins. 2001; 45: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and therefore represents the most important structural determinant for exosite I binding in thrombin. Of the polar contacts documented in the crystal structure, the ion pair involving Lys110 and the H-bonds contributed by the side chains of Ser36a and Thr74 are energetically dispensable. The only polar contacts of energetic significance are those from Gln38 and Arg77a. The results reported in this study define the regions of thrombin interacting with the receptor thrombomodulin. We find that thrombomodulin binding is controlled by a hot spot buried under the surface of the 70-loop in exosite I and supporting Tyr76 and Ile82. Other notable findings are the contribution of Phe34 located in close proximity to this hot spot and the unanticipated role of Asp100 and Asp178 in exosite II in enhancing thrombomodulin binding when mutated to Ala. No other region of thrombin appears to be significantly involved in thrombomodulin binding. This allows the active site, the 186-loop, and the autolysis loop to remain available for binding protein C in the ternary complex formed with thrombomodulin and thrombin. The results reported in this study address important points on protein-protein interactions and their value extend beyond the realm of thrombin. The observation that binding epitopes identified by Ala scanning mutagenesis are often small subsets of structural epitopes is not new and was elegantly documented in the case of the human growth hormone binding to its receptor (14Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 15Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar) and the barnase-barstar interaction (25Schreiber G. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). The incomplete overlap between structural and functional epitopes makes Ala scans absolutely necessary to correctly define residues energetically involved in protein-ligand interactions (16Greenspan N.P. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 936-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that such regions can be uncovered by studying hydrogen/deuterium exchange properties of specific residues, because residues that become buried upon formation of a complex are likely to contribute most of the binding free energy (23Mandell J.G. Baerga-Ortiz A. Akashi S. Takio K. Komives E.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows the change in binding free energy due to the Ala substitution versus the change in accessible surface area for residues defining the structural epitope of thrombomodulin in exosite I. The correlation in the plot isr = −0.01. As the identification of molecular contacts in a crystal structure cannot reveal the energetics of the interaction, the change in water accessibility of a residue upon formation of the complex cannot reveal the extent to which that residue participates energetically to binding. Another issue of interest in protein-protein interactions is whether residues of an epitope participate in ligand binding in an independent or cooperative manner (16Greenspan N.P. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 936-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It has been pointed out that epitopes are often defined by strongly interacting residues and that the binding free energy predicted from the balance of Ala scanning mutagenesis experiments over the epitope differs largely from the value obtained for the wild type (26Di Cera E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 59-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombin-thrombomodulin interaction is no exception to this rule. The predicted free energy calculated from summing the individual perturbations (see Fig. 1a) caused by Ala replacement of 24 residues in exosite I is −32.3 kcal/mol, whereas the binding free energy for wild-type thrombin interacting with thrombomodulin is −12.7 kcal/mol. The excess free energy of 19.6 kcal/mol calculated from summing the individual perturbations from the Ala scans underscores the cooperative nature of the binding epitope (16Greenspan N.P. Di Cera E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 936-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 26Di Cera E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 59-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The excess of 19.6 kcal/mol documented for the thrombin-thrombomodulin interaction compares well with the values of 13.6 kcal/mol (26Di Cera E. Adv. Protein Chem. 1998; 51: 59-119Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 12.1 kcal/mol (28Di Cera E. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1563-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) measured, respectively, for the interaction of the human growth hormone (15Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar) or of insulin (27Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) with their receptors. Interestingly, a good portion of the excess binding free energy due to residue-residue coupling in the thrombomodulin epitope can be assigned structurally to the buried quartet in exosite I. Residues Arg67, Lys70, Glu77, and Glu80 define a highly coupled ion quartet where mutation of any residue produces the same loss in thrombomodulin binding free energy of ∼3.5 kcal/mol (see Fig.1a). The structural origin of this energetic perturbation is disruption of the architecture of the 70-loop with loss of optimal orientation of Tyr76 and Ile82 and is achieved by replacing any one of the four members of the quartet. In fact, the Ala replacement of either Tyr76 or Ile82 produces a binding defect practically identical to that caused by the Ala replacement of any member of the quartet. The structural coupling among Arg67, Lys70, Glu77, and Glu80 produces an excess in the predicted binding free energy for thrombomodulin of ∼3.5 × 4 = 14 kcal/mol when the energetic perturbations of the single Ala mutations are added up, which accounts for 70% of the total excess (19.6 kcal/mol) found experimentally. The thrombin-thrombomodulin interaction can therefore be used as an instructive model system for illustrating the role of hot spots in protein-protein interactions and to dissect the structural origin of residue-residue coupling in epitopes involved in protein recognition."

To understand how this deletion interferes with protein folding, we made the equivalent deletion (ΔY490) in P-glycoprotein (P-gp). A Cys-less P-gp with cysteines in transmembrane (TM) 4 or TM5 can be cross-linked with a cysteine in TM12. Deleting Tyr490 in P-gp resulted in an inactive and defectively processed mutant in which no cross-linking between TM4 or TM5 and TM12 was detected. Expression of the ΔY490 mutant in the presence of a chemical chaperone corrected the processing defect and yielded active P-gp mutants that could be cross-linked between TM4 or TM5 and TM12.

The processing defect was corrected with a chemical chaperone and yielded active P-gp/CFTR mutant proteins that could be cross-linked.

The most common CF-associated mutation (found on at least one chromosome of 90% of affected individuals) is deletion of phenylalanine 508 (ΔF508) (3Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem B. Alon N.

P-gp and CFTR have similar structures, and both are members of the ATP-bindingcassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters (8Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar). P-gp is an ATP-dependent drug pump in the plasma membrane and transports a wide variety of structurally diverse compounds out of the cell (for review, see Ref. 9Ambudkar S.V. Dey S. Hrycyna C.A.

The 1280 amino acids of P-gp are organized in two repeating units of 610 amino acids that are joined by a linker region of about 60 amino acids (10Chen C.J. Clark D. Ueda K. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M.

Mutations in P-gp at positions equivalent to those found in CFTRs of CF patients (such as deletion of Tyr490 or Phe508 in CFTR) also cause the mutant P-gps to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (13Hoof T.

In this study, we used disulfide cross-linking analysis to determine whether the “ΔF508-CFTR-like” mutations affect TM packing. Histidine-tagged wild-type, ΔY490 P-gp, and Cys-less P-gp cDNAs were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pMT21 as described previously (11Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

The oligonucleotide 5′-GCCACCACGATAAAAGAAAATCATCTTTGGCCGTGAAAATGTC-3′ was used to replace residues 483TIAENIRYG491 in P-gp with residues 501TIKENIIFG509 of CFTR (P-gp/CFTR chimera) (18Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). Phe508 in the P-gp/CFTR chimera was deleted with oligonucleotide 5′-ATAAAAGAAAATATCATCGGCCGTGAAAATGTCACC-3′. The integrity of the mutated cDNA was confirmed by sequencing the entire cDNA (19Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar). Expression of the cDNAs in HEK 293 cells and purification of histidine-tagged P-gp mutants were described previously (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Therefore, the ΔY490 P-gp (P-gp(ΔY490)) mutant was constructed. The crystal structures of ABC transporters HisP, MalK, TAP1, MJ1267, MJ0796, BtuCD, and Rad50 show that the residues that can be aligned with Tyr490 in P-gp or Phe508 in CFTR are within the third α-helix of the NBD (21Hung L.W.

Accordingly, we also constructed a P-gp/CFTR chimera in which the segment forming the α-helical structure in P-gp (483TIAENIRYG491) in NBD1 of P-gp was replaced with the corresponding α-helical region (501TIKENIIFG509) in CFTR (28Ko Y.H.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5727-5730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Phe508 in this chimera was then deleted to generate a P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508) chimera. The mutants were transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence or absence of the drug substrate cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A acts a potent chemical chaperone and induces maturation of any processing mutants. Fig.1 shows that the 170-kDa mature protein is present in cells expressing wild-type P-gp or the P-gp/CFTR chimera when expressed in the presence or absence of cyclosporin A. In the P-gp mutant with the ΔY490 mutation (P-gp(ΔY490)) or with the ΔF508 mutation (P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508)), however, the major product in the absence of cyclosporin A is the immature 150-kDa protein. The 170-kDa mature protein appears when expressed in the presence of cyclosporin A. To determine whether wild-type and mutant P-gps were active, the histidine-tagged proteins were isolated and assayed for drug (verapamil or vinblastine)-stimulated ATPase activity. Verapamil was chosen because it gives a very high stimulation of ATPase activity (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35388-35392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). There is also good correlation between vinblastine-stimulated ATPase activity and vinblastine transport (30Ambudkar S.V. Cardarelli C.O. Pashinsky I. Stein W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21160-21166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab No drug-stimulated activity was detected in mutants P-gp(ΔY490) or in P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508) when they were expressed in the absence of cyclosporin A. These mutants, however, were active when expressed in the presence of cyclosporin A (Table I). These results show that the deletion mutation inhibits the transporter from folding into an active conformation, but the protein can be made to fold into an active conformation if synthesized in the presence of a drug substrate. Since the drug-binding domain is located in the TMDs (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Loo T.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14972-14979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), it is possible that the presence of the deletion mutations affects the proper packing of the TM segments. To test this possibility, we examined TM packing by cross-linking analysis. We had previously shown that four pairs of cysteine residues in TM4, TM5, and TM12, A233C/(TM4)/S993C(TM12), I235C(TM4)/S993C(TM12), L236C(TM4)/S993C(TM12), and I299C(TM5)/S993C(TM12), were cross-linked at 4 °C with copper phenanthroline (17Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). These four pairs of cysteines could then serve as markers for detecting the proper folding of the TM segments in the deletion mutants. Accordingly, the P-gp(ΔY490) and the P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508) mutations were introduced into the cDNAs of these cysteine marker mutants. The mutants were expressed in the presence or absence of 10 μm cyclosporin A, and the membranes prepared from the transfected cells were treated with 0.2 mm copper phenanthroline at 4 °C for 0–16 min. The cross-linked membranes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis to detect the presence of cross-linked product. The cross-linked product migrates with lower mobility on SDS-PAGE (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M.E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that when these mutants were expressed in the absence of substrate, the major product was the immature 150-kDa protein in which no cross-linking was detected (Fig.2, No Cyclo A). By contrast, when these mutants were expressed in the presence of cyclosporin A, the major product was the mature 170-kDa protein, which could be cross-linked in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, +Cyclo A). Similar results were obtained with the P-gp(ΔY490) cysteine mutants (data not shown). It is interesting to note that cross-linked product was detected with all four markers, indicating that cyclosporin A was able to induce folding of the TM segments into a native conformation. How the deletion mutations in the NBD affect packing of the TM segments is not clear. It is possible that Tyr490 in P-gp (or Phe508 in CFTR) is within or close to a region in the NBD that can interact with the intracellular loops connecting the TM segments. One possibility is that NBD1 interacts with TMD1 since it was shown that these two domains interact when they are expressed as separate polypeptides (35Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The first intracellular loop connecting TM2 and TM3 is a potential site of interaction since it is a relatively large loop (49 amino acids, residues 140–188), and mutations within this loop are known to affect activity of P-gp (36Choi K.H. Chen C.J. Kriegler M. Roninson I.B. Cell. 1988; 53: 519-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7243-7248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we made 49 double cysteine mutants containing a cysteine at position 490 and another at each of the 49 positions predicted to be the first intracellular loop. The mutants were then expressed in HEK 293 cells in the presence of cyclosporin A, and the membranes were treated with oxidant before or after treatment with ATP or ATP plus vanadate. Cross-linking in the absence of vanadate was done at 37 °C rather than 4 °C because molecular motion might make it easier to form cross-links. Vanadate trapping of nucleotide locks the protein in the transition state (38Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and can alter the conformational state of P-gp (39Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For most of the mutants (e.g. N183C/Y490C), no cross-linked product was detected when cross-linking was done at 37 °C (Fig. 3). Cross-linked product was observed, however, in mutant E184C/Y490C (Fig. 3). Cross-linking was enhanced with vanadate trapping of nucleotide. No cross-linked product was detected with either Y409C or E184C (data not shown). These results indicate that Tyr490 is in a region that is close or comes close to the first intracellular loop during the catalytic cycle. The P-gp(ΔY490) and P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508) mutants are expressed only as the immature proteins and do not exhibit any detectable activity. Expression in the presence of drug substrate cyclosporin A (chemical chaperone), however, induced maturation of the P-gp(ΔY490) and P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508) mutants. The mature mutant proteins had activity characteristics similar to the parent protein. The characteristics of mutants P-gp(ΔY490) and P-gp/CFTR(ΔF508) are quite similar to those seen in CFTR with deletion of Phe508(CFTR(ΔF508)). Immature CFTR also exhibits no activity because of its altered structure (4Chen E.Y. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3797-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Inducing maturation of CFTR(ΔF508) by growth at lower temperatures (40Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) or in the presence of glycerol (41Sato S. Ward C.L. Krouse M.E. Wine J.J. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 635-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), however, correctly targets the protein to the membrane and restores chloride channel activity. Studies on short peptides containing Phe508 show this region has a propensity to form an α-helix (42Bianchet M.A., Ko, Y.H. Amzel L.M. Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 503-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 43Massiah M.A., Ko, Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7453-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Recent crystal structure studies on bacterial ABC transporters HisP and BtuCD have aligned regions corresponding to Phe508 in CFTR or Tyr490 in P-gp and predicted them to be within a short α-helix. Similarly, the “nnpredict” program developed by Knelleret al. (Ref. 44Kneller D.G. Cohen F.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, and available at www.cmpharm.ucsf.edu/∼nomi/nnpredict-instrucs.html) predicts Tyr490 in P-gp to be at the end of a short helical (7–9 residues) region. Deletion of a residue in a short α-helix or truncations may cause destabilization of the helix (45Fry D.C. Byler D.M. Susi H. Brown E.M. Kuby S.A. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3588-3598Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Also, helical regions containing phenylalanine or tyrosine may be stabilized by side-chain interactions (46Chakrabartty A. Kortemme T. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 843-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Indeed, solution structure studies on peptides based on the Phe508 region of CFTR show that deletion of this residue destabilizes the helix (43Massiah M.A., Ko, Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7453-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). While the deletions in the NBDs can cause local disruption of structures, the results in this study show that these localized perturbations can have distal effects such as disruption of packing of the TM domains. It is likely that domain-domain interactions in ABC transporters are critical during folding of the native molecule. Two observations support this idea. First, we show in this study with P-gp that deletion of a residue in NBD1 disrupted TM packing. No cross-linked product was observed between TM4 or TM5 and TM12 when the mutants were expressed in the absence of drug substrate. Interactions between TM4 and TM5 with TM12 appear to be especially important since these three TM segments form part of the drug-binding site (31Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39272-39278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Second, a P-gp deletion mutant missing the NBDs also does not fold properly (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In both cases, however, the correct TM packing was restored when the mutants were expressed in the presence of a drug substrate (this study and Ref. 15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The presence of drug substrate during folding of a processing mutant allows the mutant protein to overcome a folding barrier (“hurdle”) that is not present during folding of the native enzyme. The hurdle in the processing mutants appears to be the interaction between TM segments in TMD1 and TMD2. When the TM segments in TMD1 and TMD2 are allowed to interact, the mutant protein proceeds to fold normally (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These interactions are outlined in a model in Fig.4. In the folding of native enzyme (Fig.4 A), there are interactions between the NBDs, between the TMDs, and between the NBDs and TMDs. The presence of a deletion mutation in NBD1 disrupts its structure and causes the TMDs to be far apart and also prevents NBD1 from interacting with TMD1 (Fig.4 B). NBD1 may interact with TMD1 through the first intracellular loop. This is supported by some evidence from the crystal structure of the bacterial ABC transporter BtuCD in which the region predicted to correspond to Phe508 in CFTR or Tyr490 in P-gp may interact with the first intracellular loop (27Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). In our study we show that the first intracellular loop must be close to NBD1 especially after vanadate trapping (Fig. 3). Vanadate trapping must lock the molecule in a more rigid conformation thereby allowing residues Tyr490/Glu184 to be in contact for a longer period. In Fig. 4 C, the presence of drug substrate (chemical chaperone) allows the TMDs to pack properly and likely forces the NBD1 to fold properly. It is also possible that correct packing of the TMDs may restrict the perturbation caused by deletion of Tyr490 in P-gp (or Phe508 in CFTR) to be localized within NBD1. The fact that proper packing of the TM segments can correct the folding defect due to a mutation in NBD1 shows that there is “cross-talk” between the TMDs and the NBDs. In wild-type P-gp, the NBDs must be essential for proper folding of the TM segments since a P-gp deletion mutant (lacking the NBDs) is not folded properly and is not trafficked to the cell surface (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The requirement for the NBDs for proper folding, however, is bypassed when the deletion mutant is expressed in the presence of drug substrate (15Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24759-24765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In summary, there is significant cross-talk between the cytoplasmic (NBD) and transmembrane domains during folding of ABC transporters. Deletion of residue 490 disrupts packing of the TM segments. A similar mechanism for disrupting packing of the TM segments may occur when Phe508 is deleted in CFTR."

We tested four regions of E1A that alter growth and transcription in mammalian cells for their effects in yeast when expressed as fusions to the Gal4p DNA binding domain. Expression of the N-terminal/conserved region (CR) 1 or CR3, but not of the CR2 or the C-terminal portion of E1A, inhibited yeast growth. Growth inhibition was relieved by deletion of the genes encoding the yGcn5p, Ngg1p, or Spt7p components of the SAGA transcriptional regulatory complex, but not the Ahc1p component of the related ADA complex, indicating that the N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 regions of E1A target the SAGA complex independently. Expression of the pCAF acetyltransferase, a mammalian homologue of yGcn5p, also suppressed growth inhibition by either portion of E1A. Furthermore, the N-terminal 29 residues and the CR3 portion of E1A interacted independently with yGcn5p and pCAF in vitro. Thus, two separate regions of E1A target the yGcn5p component of the SAGA transcriptional activation complex. A subregion of the N-terminal/CR1 fragment spanning residues 30–69 within CR1 also inhibited yeast growth in a SAGA-dependent fashion. However, this region did not interact with yGcn5p or pCAF, suggesting that it makes a third contact with another SAGA component.

There are two major E1A proteins of 289 and 243 amino acids that differ only by the presence of an internal sequence of 46 amino acids in the larger protein. Comparison of the E1A sequence of multiple adenovirus serotypes has identified four distinct regions of sequence conservation (3Avvakumov N. Wheeler R. D'Halluin J.C. Mymryk J.S. J.

CR3 coincides almost exactly with the region unique to the 289-amino acid protein. E1A functions to reprogram cell growth and transcription by interacting with a variety of cellular proteins. The N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A interacts with several transcriptional coactivators including the acetyltransferases pCAF (4Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Not surprisingly, CR3 of E1A is required for activation of gene transcription during adenovirus infection (1Bayley S.T. Mymryk J.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shenk T.

Genetic studies in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated that one or more targets of E1A are conserved in this simple eukaryote. When introduced into many haploid strains of S. cerevisiae, E1A inhibits growth, leading to an accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle (19Miller M.E. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar, 20Handa H. Toda T. Tajima M. Wada T. Iida H. Fukasawa T. Gene. 1987; 58: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 21Wada T. Nogi Y. Handa H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Mutations within the N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 portions of E1A impair growth inhibition (19Miller M.E. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 domains are both important for the transcriptional activities of E1A in mammalian cells (1Bayley S.T. Mymryk J.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that E1A may interact with conserved regulatory pathways in both types of organisms to alter transcription. Several additional lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, yeast with impaired cyclic AMP signaling are insensitive to growth inhibition by E1A (19Miller M.E. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, E1A is known to act in synergy with cyclic AMP to activate gene expression (22Engel D.A. Hardy S. Shenk T. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1517-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23Engel D.A. Muller U. Gedrich R.W. Eubanks J.S. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting a remarkable conservation of function between higher and lower eukaryotes. Second, SNF/SWI-dependent transcriptional activation is required for growth inhibition by the N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A, suggesting that transcriptional activation by this fragment of E1A mediates toxicity (24Miller M.E. Cairns B.R. Levinson R.S. Yamamoto K.R. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5737-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that residues 1–29, 30–69, or the CR3 portion of E1A were each sufficient to inhibit yeast growth when expressed as fusions to the Gal4p DNA binding domain (DBD). Growth inhibition by any portion of E1A required an intact yeast SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) complex but was not related directly to transcriptional activation by E1A. We further show a physical interaction of yGcn5p and the homologous mammalian protein pCAF with residues 1–29 and the CR3 portion of E1A. Strains used in this study are shown in Table I. Yeast culture media were prepared using standard techniques (25Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. 1997 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1998Google Scholar). The yeast expression vector pAS1U (URA3 marker) was constructed from pAS1 (TRP1 marker) (26Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar) by subcloning theXbaI-NaeI fragment of pAS1 into the same sites of pRS426 (27Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). Similarly, pAS1L (LEU2 marker) was constructed by subcloning a PvuII fragment of pAS1 into the same site of pRS425 (27Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The N-terminal/CR1 domain of adenovirus type 5 E1A (amino acids 1–82) was expressed as a fusion with the Gal4p DBD (amino acids 1–147) by subcloning an EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pMA424.82T (19Miller M.E. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar) into pAS1U and pAS1L. The C-terminal domain of E1A (residues 187–289) was expressed as a fusion with the Gal4p DBD by subcloning an EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pMA-Ex2 (28Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E.

The sequences encoding residues 93–138 (CR2), 139–204 (CR3), 1–29, 30–69, or 70–82 of adenovirus type 5 E1A were PCR-amplified and subcloned asEcoRI-BamHI, EcoRI-SalI, orEcoRI-XhoI fragments into pAS1U and pAS1L.

M. Smith (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). Fragments of pCAF encoding residues 1–352 and 310–832 were generated by PCR with specific oligonucleotide primers and cloned into the vectors pJG4–5 (OriGene Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD) or pMAL-c2X (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). A vector expressing residues 310–832 of pCAF was also constructed using a double point mutant of pCAF that lacks histone acetyltransferase activity as a template (30Korzus E. Torchia J.

For growth inhibition experiments, in combination with pCAF, the coding region for the N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 portions of E1A were subcloned into the yeast vector pRS426-GAL, which contains the GAL1 rather than the ADH1 regulatory region controlling expression of amino acids 1–147 of Gal4p. The yeast expression vector pGuN and the variant pGuN-55, which expresses the adenovirus type 2 E1B 55-kDa protein (31Liang S. Hitomi M. Tartakoff A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells were plated onto appropriate synthetic complete omission plates and incubated at 30 °C. For assays of growth inhibition by E1A or E1B, plates were photographed 48 or 72 h post-transformation using a Foto/Eclipse Fotodyne gel doc system (Fotodyne Inc., Hartland, WI). Colonies of the yeast strain Y190 transformed with plasmids expressing various portions of E1A fused to the Gal4p DBD were picked and used to inoculate 5 ml of glucose-supplemented synthetic complete medium lacking uracil and leucine. Cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C with agitation. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 5 min and washed twice with 5 ml of double distilled H2O. β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described previously (25Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. 1997 Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1998Google Scholar). Enzymatic activity was calculated as (A420)/(A600 × culture volume (ml) × reaction time (min)). GST-E1A fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 bacteria and purified as per the protocol provided by the affinity resin manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro-translated [35S]methionine-labeled full-length yGcn5p (obtained from Dr. S. Berger, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA) or the carboxyl portion of pCAF spanning amino acids 310–832 were prepared using the TnT T7 coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the supplied protocol. To immobilize GST-E1A fusion proteins, 10 μg of the appropriate GST-E1A fusion protein was incubated with 25 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads in PC buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100) in a total volume of 200 μl for 20 min at 4 °C. For GST pull-down assays, immobilized GST-E1A fusion proteins were incubated with 100,000 cpm of in vitro-translated [35S]methionine-labeled yGcn5p or pCAF in pull-down buffer (50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/μl bovine serum albumin) containing Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) in a total volume of 200 μl for 1 h at 4 °C with constant rotation. After extensive washes with pull-down buffer, interacting proteins were eluted by boiling for 2 min in 10 μl of SDS sample buffer, resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by autoradiography. GST, GST-E1A fusions, maltose-binding protein (MBP), and MBP-pCAF fusion proteins were expressed in and purified from the BL21 strain of E. coli as per protocols provided by the affinity resin manufacturers (Amersham Biosciences and New England Biolabs) and dialyzed against MBP column buffer. 5 μg of recombinant MBP-pCAF was mixed with 100 μg of the appropriate GST-E1A fusion proteins and incubated for 15 min on ice. Reaction mixtures were then mixed with 10 μl of HAT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), 1.0 μl of acetyl-[3H] CoA (ICN Biomedical Research Products, Costa Mesa, CA), and 15 μg of histone II-A (Sigma) or 15 μg of bovine serum albumin as a negative control. After 45 min at 30 °C, supernatant for each reaction was spotted onto circles of p81 filter paper (Whatman Nuclepore Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). The air-dried filters were soaked in sodium carbonate/bicarbonate solution (50 mm NaHCO3, 50 mmNa2CO3) for 30 min at 37 °C, washed once in 30 ml of a 1:1:1 mixture of methanol:chloroform:acetone for 10 min, and washed twice more for 5 min. The filters were air-dried, and the amount of bound [3H]acetyl was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Expression of the adenovirus type 5 E1A protein suppresses growth when expressed in haploid strains of S. cerevisiae (19Miller M.E. Engel D.A. Smith M.M.

To determine whether other portions of E1A could inhibit growth independently of the N-terminal/CR1 region, we expressed the CR2, CR3, and C-terminal regions of E1A as fusions with the Gal4p DBD and tested them for their effect on yeast growth (Fig. 1). Like the N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A, expression of the Gal4p DBD-CR3 chimera inhibited growth. In contrast, the Gal4p DBD or the Gal4p DBD fused to the CR2 or C-terminal regions of E1A did not affect growth (Fig.1B). These results demonstrate that CR3, like the N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A, is sufficient to deregulate yeast growth independently. Studies in the simple eukaryote S. cerevisiaehave shown that fusion of a strong transcriptional activation domain to the Gal4p DBD can inhibit yeast growth (29Berger S.L. Pina B. Silverman N.

We reasoned that growth inhibition by the N- terminal/CR1 and CR3 domains E1A could be produced by a similar effect, as both of these regions of E1A function as transcriptional activation domains when fused to a DNA binding domain in mammalian cells (34Martin K.J. Lillie J.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1990; 346: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 35Bondesson M. Mannervik M. Akusjarvi G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of the N-terminal/CR1, CR2, CR3, and C-terminal regions to function as activation domains in yeast when fused to the Gal4p DBD (Fig.2). We transformed yeast strain Y190, which contains an integrated Gal4p-dependent β-galactosidase reporter gene, with expression vectors for the Gal4p DBD or the four Gal4p DBD-E1A fusions. The N-terminal/CR1 fragment of E1A strongly activated transcription in this system, and a lesser degree of transcriptional activation was observed for CR3. In contrast, neither the CR2 nor C-terminal regions activated β-galactosidase expression. Thus, the regions of E1A that inhibit growth in yeast (Fig.1B) also function to activate transcription, raising the possibility that these two activities are related. Growth inhibition mediated by fusion of the herpes simplex virus VP16 transcriptional activation domain to the Gal4p DBD has been proposed to result from sequestration of limiting components of the transcription apparatus at genomic sites (29Berger S.L. Pina B. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Agapite J. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L. Cell. 1992; 70: 251-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that a Gal4p DBD-VP16 chimera does not inhibit growth in yeast strains disrupted for components of the SAGA yeast transcriptional activation complex (29Berger S.L. Pina B. Silverman N. Marcus G.A. Agapite J. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Guarente L. Cell. 1992; 70: 251-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 36Marcus G.A. Silverman N.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5981-5989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We tested the ability of the Gal4p DBD N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 chimeras to inhibit growth in yeast strains with disruptions of NGG1, GCN5, and SPT7 (ngg1Δ, gcn5Δ, and spt7Δ, respectively), which encode components of the SAGA complex (Fig. 3). As reported previously (36Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Berger S.L. Horiuchi J. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 37Pina B. Berger S. Marcus G.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Gal4p DBD-VP16 inhibited growth in wild-type yeast strains but not in strains disrupted forNGG1 or GCN5. Interestingly, although Gal4p DBD fused to the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 domains was toxic in matched wild-type strains, neither chimera inhibited growth inngg1Δ, gcn5Δ, or spt7Δ strains. However, growth inhibition by the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 regions was not affected by deletion of AHC1 (Fig.4), which encodes a component specific to the yeast ADA transcriptional activation complex (39Eberharter A. Sterner D.E. Schieltz D. Hassan A. Yates III, J.R. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6621-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that growth inhibition mediated by either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 domains of E1A depends on the presence of an intact SAGA complex but not the related ADA complex. Mutation of SAGA components relieved growth suppression by E1A and VP16 specifically, as disruption of NGG1 had no effect on growth inhibition by the adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein (data not shown).FIG. 4The Ahc1p component of the ADA complex is not required for growth inhibition by E1A. Wild-type yeast, or an isogenic strain in which the gene encoding the Ahc1p component of the ADA transcriptional activation complex was disrupted, were transformed with vectors expressing the Gal4p DBD or the Gal4p DBD fused to the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 domains of E1A or to herpes simplex virus VP16. Transformed cells were allowed to grow ∼48 h at 30 °C and photographed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our observation that growth inhibition by either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 domains of E1A requires an intact SAGA complex suggests that both these portions of E1A interact with components of the complex. The N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A is known to interact with pCAF, a mammalian homologue of yGcn5p (4Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), and E1A has been shown to coprecipitate an HAT activity when expressed in yeast (40Sang N. Severino A. Russo P. Baldi A. Giordano A. Mileo A.M. Paggi M.G. De Luca A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27026-27033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), suggesting that this region of E1A may also target yGcn5p. We expressed the N-terminal/CR1, CR2, CR3, and C-terminal portions of E1A as fusions to GST and tested their ability to interact within vitro-transcribed and -translated yGCN5p (Fig.5A). An interaction was observed between yGcn5p and the N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 but not the CR2 or C-terminal portions of E1A. Otherwise identical experiments performed using in vitro-transcribed and -translated pCAF yielded similar results (Fig. 5B). These experiments show that the N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A can interact not only with pCAF but with the homologous yGcn5p, as well. Importantly, this observation also suggests that CR3 can target these two related proteins independently of the N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A. Based on the results presented above, growth inhibition by either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A likely results from an interaction with yGcn5p. We next tested whether expression of pCAF, a mammalian homologue of yGcn5p, would restore growth to yeast expressing these regions of E1A. We cotransformed yeast with vectors expressing either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A and vectors expressing either the amino portion of pCAF (pCAF1–352) or the carboxyl portion shown previously to interact with E1A (pCAF310–832) (4Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Yeast expressing E1A and pCAF1–352 continued to grow slowly, whereas expression of pCAF310–832 restored rapid growth to yeast expressing either fragment of E1A (Fig. 6). The observation that pCAF expression suppresses growth inhibition mediated by either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A supports our observation that pCAF interacts independently with each of these regions (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 5). Interestingly, expression of the carboxyl portion of pCAF containing two point mutations that abolish HAT activity was still able to restore rapid growth to yeast expressing E1A. As suppression of E1A induced growth inhibition was independent of the enzymatic activity of pCAF, it likely does not result from a complementation of yGcn5p activity by mammalian pCAF. Instead, the expression of pCAF may compete with endogenous yGcn5p for interaction with E1A, effectively preventing binding to yGcn5p. Full-length E1A has been shown to inhibit the acetyltransferase activity of pCAF in vitro (41Hamamori Y. Sartorelli V. Ogryzko V. Puri P.L., Wu, H.Y. Wang J.Y. Nakatani Y. Kedes L. Cell. 1999; 96: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We next examined the consequences of the interaction with either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A on the acetyltransferase activity of pCAF. Recombinant pCAF fused to the MBP was purified from E. coli and used in an in vitro HAT assay alone or in combination with portions of E1A fused to GST (Fig.7). As observed previously for full-length E1A, either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A, which we show interact with pCAF (Fig. 5), reduced the ability of pCAF to acetylate free histones (Fig. 7). This reduction in acetylation was greater than that observed with the CR2 or C-terminal portions of E1A, which do not interact with pCAF. We next determined the subregion of the N-terminal/CR1 fragment of E1A required for interaction with pCAF. Portions of E1A corresponding to amino acid residues 1–29, 30–69, and 70–82 of E1A were expressed as fusions to glutathione S-transferase and tested for interaction within vitro-transcribed and-translated yGcn5p or pCAF. Residues 1–29 were sufficient for interaction with either yGcn5p or pCAF (Fig.8, B and C). These same portions of E1A were expressed in yeast as fusions to the Gal4p DBD and examined for their ability to inhibit growth (Fig.9B) and activate transcription (Fig. 9C). The fragment corresponding to residues 70–82 had no effect on growth. Residues 1–29 reduced yeast growth, confirming further that targeting of yGcn5p by E1A is sufficient to deregulate growth in yeast. Interestingly, the fragment of E1A spanning residues 30–69 was also able to inhibit growth independently. Growth inhibition by either residues 1–29 or 30–69 of E1A was lost in a strain disrupted for GCN5 but not in a strain disrupted forAHC1 (Fig 9B). This result indicates that residues 1–29 and 30–69 of E1A both target the SAGA but not the ADA complex. As the fragment spanning residues 30–69 does not bind yGcn5pin vitro (Fig. 8B), its seems likely that it targets a separate component of the SAGA complex. Surprisingly, unlike the entire N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A, none of the small fragments, which collectively span that same region, were able to activate transcription (Fig. 9C). These results indicate that interaction with yGcn5p is not sufficient for transcriptional activation and that the ability of E1A to inhibit yeast growth is unrelated to its ability to activate transcription.FIG. 9Growth inhibition and transcriptional activation by fragments of the N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A. A, the regions of E1A expressed as Gal4p DBD fusions inS. cerevisiae are depicted as bars, and the indicated amino acid numbers are inclusive. B, the indicated yeast strains were transformed with vectors expressing the fusions described in A. Transformed cells were allowed to grow ∼48 h at 30 °C and photographed. C, yeast strain Y190 was transformed with vectors expressing the Gal4p DBD fusions described in A. The ability of each portion of E1A to stimulate transcription from a Gal4p-dependent β-galactosidase reporter gene was assayed in triplicate as described under “Materials and Methods” and is reported as percent activity of the N-terminal/CR1 fragment. Error bars indicate the standard errors.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We report here that either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 domains of E1A are sufficient to inhibit yeast growth when expressed as fusions with the Gal4p DBD. In contrast, neither the CR2 nor C-terminal domains of E1A affected yeast growth when fused to the Gal4p DBD (Fig.1B). These results agree with previous reports demonstrating that the N-terminal/CR1 domain can inhibit yeast growth (19Miller M.E. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar) and with the observation that deletions within either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 domains impair growth inhibition (19Miller M.E. Engel D.A. Smith M.M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1623-1630PubMed Google Scholar, 21Wada T. Nogi Y. Handa H. Fukasawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the CR3 domain, like the N-terminal/CR1 domain, is targeting a cellular function(s) conserved in yeast and raises the possibility that genetic analysis of CR3 function in yeast will provide useful insight into the mechanisms by which this region of E1A functions in higher eukaryotic cells. In mammalian cells, both the N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 domains are equally potent activators of gene expression when fused to the Gal4p DBD (35Bondesson M. Mannervik M. Akusjarvi G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3053-3060Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,42Mymryk J.S. Bayley S.T. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2131-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When tested in yeast, these two regions also functioned to activate transcription when fused to the Gal4p DBD (Fig. 2). This raised the possibility that their ability to inhibit growth results from activation of transcription at inappropriate genomic sites. However, this is not entirely consistent with our observation that although the N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 domains were similarly proficient at inhibiting growth (Fig 1B), transcriptional activation by the CR3 domain was much weaker than that observed for the N-terminal/CR1 domain (Fig. 2). In addition, although residues 1–29 or 30–69 of E1A are sufficient for growth inhibition (Fig.9B), neither is capable of activating transcription (Fig.9C). Thus, growth inhibition is clearly not related to the ability of E1A to activate transcription and likely results from trapping of limiting cellular factors. Previous studies in yeast using the strong herpes simplex virus transcriptional activator VP16 showed that a Gal4p DBD-VP16 chimera does not inhibit growth in yeast strains disrupted for components of the SAGA yeast transcriptional activation complex (36Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Berger S.L. Horiuchi J. Guarente L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4807-4815Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 37Pina B. Berger S. Marcus G.A. Silverman N. Agapite J. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5981-5989Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 38Marcus G.A. Horiuchi J. Silverman N. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3197-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As observed for VP16, neither the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A inhibited growth in yeast strains in which the genes encoding the Gcn5p, Ngg1p, or Spt7p components of the SAGA transcriptional activation complex were disrupted. However, both portions of E1A inhibited growth in matched wild-type strains (Fig. 3) or in yeast in which the gene encoding the Ahc1p component of the ADA transcriptional regulatory complex was disrupted (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that growth inhibition mediated by the N-terminal/CR1 and CR3 portions of E1A requires a functional SAGA complex and that growth inhibition is independent of the related ADA complex, which shares the yGcn5p, Ada2p, and Ngg1p proteins in common with SAGA (39Eberharter A. Sterner D.E. Schieltz D. Hassan A. Yates III, J.R. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6621-6631Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The requirement for the SAGA complex appears specific for growth inhibition by E1A, as growth inhibition by the unrelated adenovirus E1B 55-kDa protein was not affected by disruption of the SAGA complex (data not shown). The N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A has been shown to interact directly with a C-terminal portion of pCAF (43Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This suggested that E1A might target yGcn5p, the yeast homologue of pCAF. We confirmed that the N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A bound pCAF using an in vitroGST pull-down approach (Fig. 5) and showed that it also binds to the related yGcn5p protein. Importantly, we observed that CR3 also bound both Gcn5p and pCAF in vitro (Fig. 5), a novel finding. We also found that expression of the E1A binding portion of pCAF restored growth to yeast expressing either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A. Importantly, the ability of this portion of pCAF to restore growth to yeast expressing E1A was independent of its intrinsic HAT activity (Fig. 6). This observation suggests that the ability of pCAF to suppress growth inhibition results from its ability to interact directly with either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A. Thus, expression of pCAF may compete with yGcn5p for interaction with E1A, effectively sequestering it from endogenous yGcn5p. Taken together, these results clearly show that two independent portions of E1A bind to yGcn5p and pCAF. As a consequence of this interaction, either the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A inhibited the acetyltransferase activity of pCAF (Fig. 7). Although we did not detect any interaction of the CR2 portion of E1A with pCAF, this region also reduced the HAT activity of pCAF in vitro. This reduction was reproducible but not as pronounced as that observed with the N-terminal/CR1 or CR3 portions of E1A. A similar CR2-dependent reduction in thein vitro HAT activity of p300 has been reported (44Chakravarti D. Ogryzko V. Kao H.Y. Nash A. Chen H. Nakatani Y. Evans R.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), despite the fact that this region is not involved in p300 interaction, suggesting that it may have some general effect on this assay. Using small portions of E1A, we determined that the N-terminal 29 residues of E1A were sufficient for interaction with Gcn5p and pCAF (Fig. 8B). A previous report indicated that a deletion spanning residues 55–60 reduces, but does not ablate, the association of E1A with pCAF (43Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Reduced binding may indicate that the deleted region stabilizes the interaction with pCAF, which is supported by the observation that deletion of residues 38–67 reduces the association of E1A with HAT activity in yeast (40Sang N. Severino A. Russo P. Baldi A. Giordano A. Mileo A.M. Paggi M.G. De Luca A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27026-27033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Importantly, residues 1–29 were sufficient for growth inhibition (Fig. 9B), showing that a direct interaction between this portion of E1A and yGcn5p is sufficient to inhibit growth. However, residues 1–29 were not able to activate transcription, suggesting that whereas binding to yGcn5p may be necessary for transcriptional activation, it is not sufficient on its own. Thus, the recruitment of the yGcn5p or pCAF acetyltransferases must function in cooperation with additional E1A interacting factors to activate transcription. Intriguingly, residues 30–69 of E1A were also sufficient for growth inhibition, although they were not able to bind yGcn5p or pCAF (Fig.8B) or activate transcription (Fig. 9C). Given that disruption of multiple components of the SAGA complex relieves growth inhibition by the entire N-terminal/CR1 portion of E1A, it seems likely that residues 30–69 of E1A are targeting a second distinct component of the SAGA complex. This is further supported by our observation that disruption of GCN5 blocks growth inhibition by either residues 1–29 or 30–69 of E1A (Fig. 9B). Interestingly, an N-terminal portion of E1A spanning residues 12–54 interacts with TRRAP (45Deleu L. Shellard S. Alevizopoulos K. Amati B. Land H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8270-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the mammalian homologue of the Tra1p component of the SAGA complex, and the 243-amino acid E1A protein coprecipitates with fragments of Tra1p expressed as GST fusion from yeast extracts (33Kulesza C.A. Van Buskirk H.A. Cole M.D. Reese J.C. Smith M.M. Engel D.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These results suggest that residues 30–69 of E1A may inhibit growth by targeting Tra1p. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that two separate domains of E1A that function as transcriptional activators in mammalian cells retain this function in S. cerevisiae, underscoring the conservation of basic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation between yeast and higher eukaryotes. We have also shown that three independent domains of E1A have evolved to target the SAGA complex in vivo, highlighting the important role of this complex in gene regulation. This provides a new genetic system to further elucidate mechanisms by which E1A and the SAGA complex regulate transcription and growth. We thank Jay Loftus and Peter Chueng for technical assistance.

Implication of this protein in carcinogenesis is linked to its mitogenic, angiogenic, and transforming activities. Recently, we have demonstrated that the C-terminal residues 111–136 of HARP are required for its mitogenic and transforming activities (Bernard-Pierrot, I., Delbe, J., Caruelle, D., Barritault, D., Courty, J., and Milhiet, P.

Similarly, the synthetic corresponding peptide P111–136 displayed in vitro inhibition of wild type HARP activities, but in this case, the inhibition was mainly explained by the competition of the peptide with HARP for the binding to the extracellular domain of the high affinity ALK receptor.

As depicted in several studies, gene expression of these growth factors is deregulated in solid tumors, and these polypeptides contribute to autocrine and paracrine stimuli leading to the development of the tumor tissues. Among these growth factors, angiogenic polypeptides appear to be very interesting therapeutic targets because angiogenesis plays a key role in cancer development, and negative regulators of angiogenesis are under clinical evaluation (reviewed in Ref. 1Cherrington J.M.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2933-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), is an 18-kDa-secreted polypeptide that constitutes with Midkine (MK), a two-member family among the heparin-binding growth factors. The pattern of expression of HARP suggests that this molecule has functions in neuronal migration and in epithelium-mesenchyme interactions during the embryonic development (5Vanderwinden J.M. Mailleux P. Schiffmann S.N. Vanderhaeghen J.J. Anat. Embryol. 1992; 186: 387-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, although HARP is mainly down-regulated after birth, it seems to play a key role in cell growth and differentiation during adulthood. It seems particularly involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis (6Choudhuri R. Zhang H.T. Donnini S. Ziche M. Bicknell R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1814-1819PubMed Google Scholar). HARP mRNA and/or protein are highly expressed in neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and gastrointestinal, prostate, and primary breast cancers (7Fang W. Hartmann N. Chow D.T. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J.

HARP displays several in vitro biological activities. It induces neurite-outgrowth in embryonic neural cells through its binding to the heparan sulfate proteoglycanN-syndecan or to the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan RPTPβ (12Maeda N. Noda M. J.

HARP also displays transforming activity because transfection of NIH-3T3 or normal rat kidney (NRK) fibroblastic cells with the HARP cDNA led to morphological transformations, anchorage independent growth, and tumor formation in nude mice (15Chauhan A.K., Li, Y.S. Deuel T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In agreement with its role in angiogenesis, HARP induces migration of aortic endothelial cells in collagen (16Laaroubi K. Delbe J. Vacherot F. Desgranges P. Tardieu M. Jaye M. Barritault D. Courty J. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and enhances plasminogen activator activity in the same cells (17Kojima S. Inui T. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Muramatsu H. Amanuma H. Maruta H. Muramatsu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, the mitogenic and transforming activities of HARP have been linked to its binding to the tyrosine kinase receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inducing its phosphorylation and recruitment of downstream effector molecules such as IRS-1, Shc, phospholipase C-γ, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (18Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D.J. Wen D. Karavanov A. Riegel A.T. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16772-16779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). NMR experiments have clearly demonstrated that the HARP molecule is organized into two β-sheet domains linked by a flexible linker, and this structure is maintained through five intrachain disulfide bonds (19Kilpelainen I.

Each β-sheet domain contains a heparin-binding site, which plays a role in the modulation of HARP mitogenic activity (20Vacherot F. Delbe J. Heroult M. Barritault D. Fernig D.G. Courty J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7741-7747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that at least one heparin-binding domain is involved in the dimerization of HARP (21Bernard-Pierrot I. Heroult M. Lemaitre G. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Two clusters of basic residues are located at the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, and we have recently shown that the lysine-rich C-terminal tail of HARP is required for its mitogenic and tumor-formation activities but not for the neurite outgrowth-promoting activity (22Bernard-Pierrot I.

Indeed the deletion mutant HΔ111–136, deleted of its last 25 amino acids, was shown to display no mitogenic activity on BEL cells or NIH-3T3 cells and shown to be unable to induce tumor formation in nude mice but to stimulate the neurite outgrowth of rat embryonic neurons. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that HΔ111–136 and the corresponding synthetic polypeptide P111–136, lacking mitogenic, angiogenic, and tumor formation activities, could act as potent inhibitors of these HARP biological activities. Culture medium, fetal calf serum (FCS), and G418 were supplied by Invitrogen. Superblocker® solution was purchased from Pierce, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat, goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins G was purchased from Jackson, and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride substrate and disuccinimidyl suberate were purchased from Interchim (Montluçon, France). Goat anti-human HARP antibodies were from R&D (Oxon, United Kingdom). Heparin-Sepharose gel and Mono-S column were from Amersham Biosciences, Immobilon-P was from Millipore Corp. (Saint-Quentin en Yvelynes, France), BM chemiluminescence®and FuGENE6® were from Roche Mannheim (Meylan, France), and mouse anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAP kinase was from New England BioLabs (Saint-Quentin en Yvelynes, France). [Methyl-3H]thymidine was provided by ICN (Orsay, France) and Matrigel was from BD PharMingen. Peptides P111–136 (KLTKPKPQAESKKKKKEGKKQEKMLD) and P1–21 (AEAGKKEKPEKKVKKSDCGEW) were synthesized by the Synt:em laboratory (Nı̂mes, France). Recombinant fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), MK, and mutated and wild type (WT) HARP were purified in the laboratory by sequential heparin-Sepharose and Mono-S chromatographies from bacteria and conditioned media of eukaryotic cells, respectively (22Bernard-Pierrot I.

Bovine angiogenin was a generous gift from Dr. G. Spik (UMR8576 CNRS, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France). The incorporation of [methyl-3H]thymidine by serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells was performed as previously described (22Bernard-Pierrot I. Delbe J. Caruelle D. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12228-12234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 2.5 × 105 NIH-3T3 cells were seeded in 35-mm culture dishes for 24 h, serum-starved for 24 h, and stimulated 5 min at 37 °C with samples. Cells were lysed with electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol), and the presence of p42/p44 or phospho-p42/p44 MAP kinase was detected by Western blot (22Bernard-Pierrot I.

Three-dimensional collagen gels were prepared following the procedure of Montesano with minor modifications (16Laaroubi K. Delbe J. Vacherot F. Desgranges P. Tardieu M. Jaye M. Barritault D. Courty J. Growth Factors. 1994; 10: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23Montesano R. Vassali J.D. Baird A. Guillemin R. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.9 × 105 aortic endothelial cells (ABAE) per well of a 4-well culture plate were seeded on a three-dimensional collagen gel in complete medium. 24 h after plating, proteins were added every day. Three days later, tubular network structures were quantified using phase contrast microscopy. The experiment was repeated three times and carried out in duplicate. Data are the means of 10 randomly chosen fields/well with indicated standard errors and representative results shown. Four Swiss mice per sample (Janvier, Le Genest St Isle, France) were subcutaneously injected with 0.2 ml of Matrigel alone or containing proteins according to the previously described procedure (24Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar). The injected Matrigel rapidly formed a single solid gel plug. Mice were sacrificed after 6 days, and the Matrigel plugs were excised and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sample sections of 10 μm thick were made using a cryostat (Leica) and extemporaneously stained with Gomori-Trichrome for microscopic observation. Endothelial cell invasion and vessel ingrowth was quantified by computer image analysis using the NIH Image analyzing software. MDA-MB 231 cells were culture in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 10% FCS at 37 °C with 7% CO2. MDA-MB 231 cells were transfected with 4 μg of pCDNA-3 or pCDNA3-HΔ111–136 plasmids using the liposomal system FuGENE6 according to the manufacturer's protocol and selected 48 h later with G418 at 600 μg/ml. Medium was changed every 2 days until colonies were formed. The amount of HARP proteins secreted by each clone was determined using an immunometric assay (25Soulie P. Heroult M. Bernard I. Kerros M.E. Milhiet P.E. Delbe J. Barritault D. Caruelle D. Courty J. J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2002; 23: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and clones secreting the largest amount of HARP were selected. For these clones, the presence of both HARP and mutant proteins in the culture medium was further investigated by Western blotting after heparin-Sepharose purification. 2 × 104 cells of the clonally selected MDA-MB 231 cell line were seeded in triplicate into 6-well plates containing agar and DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. After 14 days, colonies with diameters greater than 50 μm were scored as positive using a phase contrast microscope equipped with a measuring grid. Tumor formation in 5-week-old male athymic nude mice (Nu/Nu; IFFA CREDO Laboratories) was tested by subcutaneous injection of 4 × 106 transfected MDA-MB 231 cells suspended in 100 μl of DMEM in each flank. Tumor size was measured twice a week, starting from the second week following injection. Mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after injection. Purified recombinant HARP or HΔ111–136 (15 pmol) were pre-incubated for 60 min at 25 °C in the presence of 10 μg/ml heparin and treated with 0.5 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate according to the manufacturer's protocol, and products were analyzed using a 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE and anti-HARP Western blotting experiment. A construct coding for the entire extracellular domain of human ALK (that we named RECA) linked to a His8 tag was generated using PCR experiments from the pCDNA3-ALK (26Souttou B. Carvalho N.B. Raulais D. Vigny M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9526-9531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The resulting RECA-His cDNA was further subcloned into the pCEP4 vector (Invitrogen) to generate pCEP4-RECA-His. The human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cell line transfected with the EBNA-1 gene (Invitrogen) was cultured in DMEM containing 10% FCS and 0.4 mg/ml geneticin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. HEK-293 cells plated at 5 × 103 cells/cm2 for 2 days were transfected by electroporation with pCEP4-RECA-His. Thirty-six hours after transfection, medium was changed and hygromycin (Sigma) was added to the medium at 0.5 mg/ml. After 10 days of selection, the medium was changed to the serum-free AIM-V synthetic medium (Invitrogen). The AIM-V production media were collected every 2–3 days. The secreted RECA-His protein was purified from the AIM-V production media over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid superflow column (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) following the manufacturer's protocol. Rabbits were immunized with the purified RECA-His protein. IgG fractions of the immune sera were immunopurified using DEAE chromatography. Purified recombinant HARP, HΔ111–136, FGF-2, MK, angiogenin, peptides P111–136 and P1–21 were coated 1 h at 37 °C in 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, (100 μl) on a 96-well EIA plate (costar). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked 1 h at 37 °C with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 (v/v) (PBS-T) containing 3% BSA (w/v). Wells were then incubated with RECA diluted in PBS-T containing 1% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C and exposed for 1 h at 37 °C to rabbit anti-RECA antibodies diluted at 1 μg/ml in PBS-T containing 1% BSA. Bound antibodies were visualized using a peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit antibodies at a 1:5000 dilution in PBS-T containing 1% BSA, and the peroxidase activity was detected with 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine dihydrochloride substrate according to the supplier. The mitogenic activity of HARP in the presence of different concentrations of the HΔ111–136 mutant was investigated on serum-starved NIH-3T3 cells. A 2-fold increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation was observed for 2 nm HARP and inhibited in a dose-dependant manner by addition of HΔ111–136 (Fig.1A). A maximum 70% inhibitory effect was observed for 7.5 nm HΔ111–136 corresponding to a molecular ratio of 3:1 between mutant and HARP protein. As expected from previous results (22Bernard-Pierrot I. Delbe J. Caruelle D. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12228-12234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), no mitogenic activity of HΔ111–136 alone was observed. In a control experiment, stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by 0.2 nm FGF-2 was not affected by HΔ111–136 (Fig.1A). The specificity of the HΔ111–136 inhibitory effect was also tested with the structurally related molecule MK, which displayed no effects upon 2 nm HARP stimulation (data not shown). Because the HARP mitogenic signal, at least in BEL and NIH-3T3 cells, is transduced through the MAP kinase signaling pathway leading to the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (22Bernard-Pierrot I.

As expected from cell proliferation experiments ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation induced by HARP was inhibited in a dose-dependant manner by the addition of HΔ111–136. As the HΔ111–136 mutant protein specifically inhibited the HARP-induced cell proliferation, its effect on the angiogenic activity of HARP was investigated in vitro and in vivo using aortic bovine endothelial cells cultured on a three-dimensional collagen gel (23Montesano R. Vassali J.D. Baird A. Guillemin R. Orci L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar) and a mouse Matrigel plug assay (24Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. In vitro, 20 nm HARP induced a tubular network structure formation within 72 h (Fig.2B). As compared with the HARP-treated cells (Fig. 2A), 60 nm HΔ111–136 inhibited the HARP-induced angiogenic effect by more than 66% (Fig.2E), whereas no significant effect was observed either in cells treated with 60 nm HΔ111–136 alone (Fig.2C) or in control cells (Fig. 2A). A tubular network comparable with that formed using HARP was also obtained with 3 nm FGF-2, and no significant effect was observed with HΔ111–136 (data not shown). In the in vivo angiogenesis assay, a 3-fold increase in the infiltration of endothelial cells was observed when 3 nm HARP was added to Matrigel as compared with control (Matrigel alone) (Fig. 3, A, C, and G). Addition of 10 nm HΔ111–136 with 3 nm HARP in Matrigel, corresponding to a 3:1 ratio, resulted in a 50% inhibition of the angiogenic activity of HARP, whereas no Matrigel infiltration was observed with HΔ111–136 alone (Fig. 3, B, D, and G). As a control, 10 nm FGF-2 was tested and a more pronounced increase, as compared with HARP, of the infiltration of Matrigel by endothelial cells was obtained. As expected from thein vitro assay, no significant inhibition of FGF-2 by HΔ111–136 was observed (Fig. 3, E, F, and G).FIG. 3HΔ111–136 inhibition of HARP-induced in vivo angiogenic activity. Liquid Matrigel was injected subcutaneously into mice alone or in the presence of proteins. Mice were sacrificed after 6 days, and Matrigel plugs were sectioned and stained using the Gomori-Trichrome method for microscopic observation (magnification ×100). The number of infiltrated endothelial cells was determined by averaging six fields from one section of Matrigel plugs per mouse (G). The results are expressed as the mean of four mice per condition, and standard errors are indicated (**, 0.001 <p < 0.01). Micrographs A–F represent Gomori-Trichrome staining of a sectioned Matrigel plug alone (A) or in the presence of 10 nm HΔ111–136 (B), 3 nm HARP (C), a 3 nm HARP/10 nm HΔ111–136 mixture (D), 10 nm FGF-2 (E), or a 10 nm FGF-2/10 nm HΔ111–136 mixture (F).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB 231 has been previously demonstrated to produce endogenous HARP, which acts in an autocrine manner. These cells were therefore used to test the inhibitory effect of the HΔ111–136 mutant protein on HARP-transforming activity. MDA-MB 231 cells were transfected with pCDNA3 alone (control) or pCDNA3-HΔ111–136, and clones were selected for their ability to secrete HARP. The presence of both HARP and HΔ111–136 proteins in the culture media was checked by Western blotting experiments, and proteins were similarly secreted (data not shown). Two representative clones (control and HΔ111–136-expressing cells) were further studied for their ability to grow in soft agar. Under our experimental conditions, HΔ111–136-expressing clones formed 2-fold fewer colonies than control cells (Table I). These results suggested that HΔ111–136 had inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB 231 cells. To further investigate the inhibitory effect of HΔ111–136 protein on HARP-transforming activity, one HΔ111–136 clone and one control clone were tested for their ability to form tumors in nude mice. Six weeks after the injection, ten of twelve mice injected with MDA-MB 231 control cells had developed tumors, whereas only one mouse injected with MDA-MB 231 cells expressing HΔ111–136 had developed a tiny tumor (Table I). A difference of weight between the two pools of mice could also be noticed. To ensure that tumors derived from G418-resistant-injected cells, tumor fractions were dispersed and cultured in medium containing 600 μg/ml of the antibiotic. Under these conditions, most cells from the tumors appeared to be G418-resistant (data not shown). These results indicate that the ability of MDA-MB 231 cells to form tumors in nude mice was strongly inhibited by a dominant negative effect of HΔ111–136 mutant protein and that the transforming activity of these cells is really dependent on their HARP expression.Table IHΔ111–136 reverses colony formation in soft agar of MDA-MB 231 cells and prevents tumor formation in the nude miceStably transfected MDA-MB 231 cellsNumber of colonies/cm2 in soft agar assayNumber of mice with tumorTumor sizeWeightmm3gControl-1190 ± 1010/1251 ± 1223 ± 2Control-2160 ± 8HΔ111–136 clone178 ± 71/12231 ± 1HΔ111–136 clone287 ± 10 Open table in a new tab Two hypothesis could be raised to explain the dominant negative effect: i) because HARP had been demonstrated to homodimerize (21Bernard-Pierrot I. Heroult M. Lemaitre G. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), HΔ111–136 could form a non-functional heterodimer with HARP and ii) the mutant protein could compete against HARP for binding to the high affinity receptor ALK and consequently block signal transduction. To determine whether HΔ111–136 was capable of heterodimerizing with HARP, we performed chemical cross-linking and Western blotting experiments. As expected, HARP could form homodimers in the presence of heparin (Fig. 4, lane 2) (21Bernard-Pierrot I. Heroult M. Lemaitre G. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and similarly, HΔ111–136 could also homodimerize (Fig. 4, lane 1). However, in the presence of WT and mutant proteins, both homo- and heterodimers were observed (Fig. 4, lane 3). The ability of HΔ111–136 to bind to the high affinity ALK receptor was investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the recombinant extracellular domain of the ALK receptor (RECA) produced in high eukaryotic cells. Recombinant purified HARP (500 ng/well) was coated and incubated with increasing concentrations of RECA ranging from 0 to 600 ng/well (Fig.5A). Anti-RECA immunodetection revealed that RECA binds HARP in a dose-dependant manner reaching a plateau at a RECA concentration of 300 ng/well. Then, various quantities of either HARP, HΔ111–136, or control basic proteins including MK, FGF-2, and angiogenin were coated and incubated with 300 ng of RECA per well (Fig. 5B). RECA displayed a specific and saturable binding to the precoated HARP and MK proteins, whereas only background signals were detected with the HΔ111–136 mutant protein, FGF-2, or angiogenin. These results strongly suggest the absence of HΔ111–136 binding to its high affinity receptor and could explain the absence of signal transduction using this mutant (Fig.1B, lane 4) (22Bernard-Pierrot I. Delbe J. Caruelle D. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12228-12234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results and our previous report seem to implicate the lysine rich C-terminal domain of HARP in the binding to its high affinity receptor ALK. To confirm this hypothesis, the ability of the peptide P111–136, corresponding to the last 25 amino acids of HARP, to interact with RECA was tested using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described above. The P1–21 peptide was used as a control because it also contained a lot of lysines and has a similar backbone size. Various amounts of P111–136 and of the P1–21 N-terminal peptide of HARP (28Papadimitriou E. Heroult M. Courty J. Polykratis A. Stergiou C. Katsoris P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) were coated and incubated with 300 ng of RECA per well (Fig. 5C). A specific and saturable signal was observed when P111–136 was immobilized, whereas only a background signal was detected using P1–21. Our results strongly strengthened the fact that HARP binds to the ALK receptor via its C-terminal domain and suggested that P111–136 could act as a dominant negative effector to inhibit WT HARP biological activities. This assumption was validated because P111–136 inhibited, in a dose-dependant manner, the [3H]thymidine incorporation induced by HARP (Fig. 6A). About 75% inhibition was observed on serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells with 10 μm P111–136, although P1–21 was unable to inhibit HARP stimulation. Inhibition of the in vitro transforming activity of HARP by P111–136 was also evaluated in soft agar assays using MDA-MB 231 cells. Cells were seeded in soft agar and various amounts of P1–21 and P111–136 were added in culture medium. As shown in Fig. 6B, the transforming activity of WT HARP was prevented in a dose-dependant manner by addition of P111–136, and no inhibition was observed with P1–21. The number of colonies was 50% decreased by 10 μm P111–136 peptide. HARP is expressed in many human tumors and tumoral cell lines including neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, melanoma, pancreatic, and breast cancers (6Choudhuri R. Zhang H.T. Donnini S. Ziche M. Bicknell R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21358-21363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated the involvement of the C-terminal 111–136 amino acid of HARP in the mitogenic and in the transforming activities of this growth factor. These results prompted us to investigate the potential dominant negative effect of the C-terminal-truncated protein for the different characterized biological activities of HARP. Inhibition of HARP mitogenic, transforming, and angiogenic activities was observed in the presence of HΔ111–136 suggesting that similar structural determinants of the HARP molecule were implicated in these three activities. The dominant negative effect of HΔ111–136 on HARP-transforming activity was investigated using MDA-MB 231 cells. These cells were previously shown to express HARP and its high affinity receptor ALK, which is essential for the malignant phenotype (31Powers C. Aigner A. Stoica G.E. McDonnell K. Wellstein A. J.

Similar partial inhibition had already been observed with other tumoral cell lines such as colorectal Colo 357 cells and melanoma WI 852 or 1205 Lu cells using HARP ribozyme targeting or HARP antisense strategies (9Weber D. Klomp H.J. Czubayko F. Wellstein A. Juhl H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5284-5288PubMed Google Scholar, 30Czubayko F. Schulte A.M. Berchem G.J. Wellstein A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in vivo, tumor formation into nude mice, usually obtained with MDA-MB 231 cells, was completely abolished when HΔ111–136-expressing MDA-MB 231 cells were injected suggesting that both the growth advantage and the angiogenic activity were inhibited. The dominant negative effect of HΔ111–136 on angiogenic activity was also supported by its ability to in vitro inhibit the formation of capillary network in a three-dimensional collagen gel and to strongly decrease in vivo the HARP-induced infiltration of Matrigel plugs by endothelial cells. The dimerization of growth factors such as FGF-1 and FGF-2 is responsible for receptor dimerization, cellular activation, and cell proliferation (34Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3502) Google Scholar), and such a mechanism has been proposed for HARP (21Bernard-Pierrot I. Heroult M. Lemaitre G. Barritault D. Courty J. Milhiet P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In regards to the results presented here, it seems that heterodimerization of the C-terminal mutant with HARP mainly explains its dominant negative effect. This heterodimerization is favored for a 3:1 molecular ratio between HΔ111–136 and HARP suggesting that under these conditions an excess of the mutant protein can dissociate HARP homodimers, inducing the formation of non-functional heterodimers. A similar mechanism had been proposed for HARP-transforming activities (35Zhang N. Zhong R. Wang Z.Y. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16733-16736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These results strengthen the role of HARP dimers as the active forms of HARP for its mitogenic, angiogenic, and transforming activities. During this study, we also investigated the binding of HΔ111–136 and HARP to the extracellular domain (RECA) of the tyrosine kinase receptor ALK, recently identified as a part of the HARP signaling pathway involved in mitogenic and transforming activities. The involvement of ALK in the HARP biological activities that we evaluated was first attested by the ability of RECA to bind HARP using the mitogenic activity assay with NIH-3T3 cells. RECA therefore induced a dose-dependant inhibition of the [3H]thymidine incorporation due to HARP and transfection of non-responsive Chinese hamster ovary cells with the ALK cDNA-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation and cellular proliferation of the selected clones by HARP (data not shown). The absence of interaction between HΔ111–136 and RECA that we have observed strongly suggests that HARP binds to ALK via its C-terminal domain. This assumption was reinforced by the binding of RECA to the synthetic peptide corresponding to the truncated mutant HΔ111–136 and the dominant negative effects of this peptide for HARP in vitro biological activities. The specificity of the interaction between the C-terminal part of HARP and RECA was mainly validated by the fact that P1–21, the HARP N-terminal peptide with basic properties close to P111–136 (pI of 9.37 versus 10.08), was not able to interact with RECA. Correlatively, a mutant deleted of the basic N-terminal cluster of lysines (HΔ1–12) kept mitogenic, angiogenic, and transforming activities and a binding capacity to RECA (data not shown). During these experiments, specific binding of MK to RECA was also observed, suggesting that ALK could be a common receptor for MK and HARP as observed with PTPζ (36Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Kimura T. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. Noda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12474-12479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is currently under study. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the dominant negative effects on HARP biological activities of the truncated mutant HΔ111–136 and of the corresponding synthetic peptide P111–136. We have also underlined the binding of HARP to the high affinity receptor ALK through its C-terminal part. It is noteworthy that proteolysis of the C-terminal tail of HARP could be achieved in vitro by plasmin, 2I. Bernard-Pierrot, J. Delbé, V. Rouet, M. Vigny, M.-E. Kerros, D. Caruelle, D. Raulais, D. Barritault, J. Courty, and P. E. Milhiet, unpublished data. suggesting that such a mechanism could exist in vivo and participate in the regulation of HARP biological activities. Considering the importance of HARP as a rate-limiting autocrine growth factor in pancreatic and breast cancer cells (9Weber D. Klomp H.J. Czubayko F. Wellstein A. Juhl H.

Synthetic HARP-related peptides or controlled expression of dominant negative mutant proteins into target cells could be used to block HARP growth tumor-promoting activity and now have to be evaluated."
https://openalex.org/W2122039365,"Abstract In Dictyostelium discoideum counting factor (CF), a secreted ∼450-kDa complex of polypeptides, inhibits group and fruiting body size. When the gene encoding countin (a component of CF) was disrupted, cells formed large groups. We find that recombinant countin causes developing cells to form small groups, with an EC50 of ∼3 ng/ml, and affects cAMP signal transduction in the same manner as semipurified CF. Recombinant countin increases cell motility, decreases cell-cell adhesion, and regulates gene expression in a manner similar to the effect of CF. However, countin does not decrease adhesion or group size to the extent that semipurified CF does. A 1-min exposure of developing cells to countin causes an increase in F-actin polymerization and myosin phosphorylation and a decrease in myosin polymerization, suggesting that countin activates a rapid signal transduction pathway. 125I-Labeled countin has countin bioactivity, and binding experiments suggest that vegetative and developing cells have ∼53 cell-surface sites that bind countin with a K D of ∼1.5 ng/ml or 60 pm. We hypothesize that countin regulates cell development through the same pathway as CF and that other proteins within the complex may modify the activity of countin and/or have independent size-regulating activities."
https://openalex.org/W2003783113,"CD9, a member of the tetraspanin family of proteins, is characterized by four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops. Surface expression of CD9 on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells dramatically enhances spreading and motility on fibronectin. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of CD9-fibronectin interaction, binding to fibronectin was investigated using purified and recombinant forms of CD9. The affinity of fibronectin for CD9 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 81 ± 25 nm. The binding of fibronectin to immobilized CD9 was enhanced by Ca2+ ions. Protein binding and peptide competition studies demonstrated that peptide 6 derived from CD9 extracellular loop 2 (amino acids 168–192) contained part of the fibronectin-binding domain. Additionally, enhanced adhesion of CD9-CHO-B2 cells to fibronectin was significantly reduced by peptide 6. CD9-CHO cells had a 5-fold increase in motility to fibronectin as compared with mock-transfected controls, an effect that correlated with CD9 cell surface density. Truncation of CD9 extracellular loop 2 and peptide 6 caused inhibition of CD9-CHO cell motility to fibronectin. Deletion of CD9 extracellular loop 1 had no significant effect on CHO cell motility. These findings demonstrate a critical role for CD9 extracellular loop 2 in cell motility to fibronectin and clarify the mechanism by which CD9-fibronectin interaction modulates cell adhesion and motility.

Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Based on cDNA sequence analysis, the TM4SF members are predicted to be single polypeptide chains with four highly hydrophobic putative transmembrane (TM) regions and two extracellular (EC) loops with both the NH2 and COOH termini localized intracellularly. The putative transmembrane domains and certain residues in the EC loops are highly conserved, suggesting that these proteins perform closely related functions (1Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The cellular function of the TM4SF proteins is not yet clear, but indirect data suggest that most TM4SF members mediate cellular functions such as adhesion, motility, and differentiation (1Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). The role of CD9 in many cell types has been investigated via anti-CD9 mAb perturbation studies. Anti-CD9 mAbs have been shown to mediate the proliferation, adhesion, and motility of neural cells (2Anton E.S. Hadjiargyrou M. Patterson P.H. Matthew W.D. J. Neuorosci. 1995; 15: 584-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kaprielian Z. Cho K.-O. Hadjiargyou M. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 562-573Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hadjiargyrou M. Patterson P.H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 574-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An anti-CD9 mAb enhanced the migration of Schwann cells on living neurites and sciatic nerve sections (2Anton E.S. Hadjiargyrou M. Patterson P.H. Matthew W.D. J. Neuorosci. 1995; 15: 584-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody-mediated enhancement of Schwann cell migration correlated with increases in cytosolic calcium and phosphoproteins. Ectopic expression of CD9 on nonmotile Raji cells gave rise to β1 integrin-dependent motility on FN (5Shaw A.R.E. Domanska A. Mak A. Gilchrist A. Dobler K. Visser L. Poppema S. Fliegel L. LeTarte M. Willett B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24092-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). CD9 was also found to participate in endothelial cell migration during wound repair (6Klein-Soyer C. Azorsa D.O. Cazenave J.-P Lanza F. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 360-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that CD9 deficiency in mice does not significantly affect smooth muscle cell migration or neointima formation after vascular injury (7Lijnen H.R. Lupu F. Collen D., Le Naour F. Boucheix C. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 83: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of CD9, one or more of the other TM4SF members may compensate for lack of CD9 function. Conversely, studies using CD9-null mice have demonstrated an essential role for CD9 in egg/sperm fusion (8Le Naour F. Rubinstein E. Jasmin C. Prenant M Boucheix C. Science. 2000; 287: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar, 9Miyado K. Yamada G. Yamada S. Hasuwa H. Nakamura Y. Ryu F. Suzuki K. Kosai K. Inoue K. Okabe M. Mekada E. Science. 2000; 287: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that high affinity binding between fertilin beta (ADAM2) and α6β1 integrin requires cooperation between α6β1 and CD9 (10Chen M.S. Tung K.S. Coorod S.A. Takahashi Y Bigler D. Chang A. Yamashita Y. Kincade P.W. Herr J.C. White J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11830-118835Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies on a number of cell types have shown that CD9 and other TM4SF members associate with integrins (1Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). CD9 was specifically coimmunoprecipitated from S-16 Schwann cell extracts using mAbs against integrins α4, α6, and β1 and double-immunofluorescence labeling studies suggested that CD9 colocalizes with these integrins on the cell membrane (11Hadjiargyrou M. Kaprielian Z. Kato N. Patterson P.H. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2505-2513Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that prototype complexes of CD9, CD81, and α3β1 and complexes of CD63 and phosphoinositide 3′-OH kinase may localize within lipid raft-like domains on the cell surface (12Claas C. Stipp C.S. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7974-7984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These data suggest that CD9 either interacts directly with ECM proteins or influences the activity of adhesion molecules indirectly via physical association or the modulation of intracellular signaling pathways. We have previously demonstrated that surface expression of CD9 in CHO cells induced unique growth patterns and a dramatic enhancement of CHO cell spreading on the extracellular matrix protein, FN (13Cook G.A. Wilkinson D.A. Crossno J.T., Jr. Raghow R. Jennings L.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 356-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that binding of purified FN to platelet-derived or recombinant CD9 was dose-dependent, enhanced by Ca2+ ions, and that the affinity of this interaction was 80 nm. Part of the FN-binding domain was located within CD9 EC2 (residues 168–192). A peptide spanning this EC2 region competitively inhibited the interaction of the CD9 with FN in a purified ELISA system and inhibited the adhesion of CD9-CHO-B2 cells to FN. We also showed that CHO cells with high CD9 surface density had significantly greater FN-directed cell motility as compared with mock-CHO cells. These effects were seen with two independent CHO cell clones and with two heterogenous populations of CD9-expressing CHO cells. Using CD9-CHO cells expressing a lower surface density of human CD9, we were able to demonstrate that CD9 surface density had a direct relationship with CHO cell motility to FN. Mutant CD9-CHO cells lacking regions of CD9 EC2 had significantly decreased haptotactic motility to FN. Additionally, CD9-mediated CHO cell motility was specifically blocked by peptide 6 corresponding to the FN binding site of CD9 EC2. Deletion of CD9 EC1 did not significantly affect CD9-mediated motility. These findings suggest that CD9-FN interaction markedly influences FN-directed CHO cell movement and that direct interaction between CD9 and FN is required for this effect. The wild type CHO cell line (CHO-K1 ATCC #CCl-61) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD.

Peptide 5 (YKDTYNKLKTKDEPQRETLKAI), peptide 6 (PKKDVLETFTVKSCPDAIKEVFDNK), and peptide 6S (KEFDFKAPSVCKVEDIDTKTLPKVN) were either prepared and purified by Dr. Jerome Seyer and Dr. Bob Cassell, Veteran’s Medical Center, Memphis, TN, or synthesized by Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). Cell culture medium RPMI 1640, trypsin, Geneticin, and human plasma FN were from Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD. Fetal bovine serum was from HyClone, Logan, UT. Immunochemical reagents included MIgG, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) polyclonal rabbit anti-FN (Invitrogen), and alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). The antibodies RAP2 and mAb7 have been described previously (15Jennings L.K. Fox C.F. Kouns W.C. McKay C.P. Ballou L.R. Schulz H.E. J. Biol.

Mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV was from Invitrogen. Cloning vector pBluescript II SK+ was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). LipofectAMINE transfection reagent, Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium, molecular biology reagents (including restriction endonucleases), modifying enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Taq DNA polymerase were all purchased from Invitrogen. PCR oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by Sigma Genosys. All other chemicals were from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO. Media A was 90% (v/v) RPMI, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Media B consisted of RPMI containing 1% (w/v) BSA. Media C was 85% (v/v) RPMI, 15% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Standard ELISA buffers comprised of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, 3.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.0), blocking buffer 1 (buffer A plus 5% BSA plus 0.05% Tween 20), buffer B (buffer A plus 1% BSA plus 0.05% Tween-20), and buffer C (buffer B minus CaCl2). ELISA buffers for metal cation studies were as follows; buffer D (50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.0), buffer E (buffer D plus 1% BSA plus 0.05% Tween 20), Blocking buffer 2 (buffer D plus 5% BSA plus 0.05% Tween 20 plus 0–4.5 mm metal salt), buffer F (buffer A plus 1% BSA plus 0.05% Tween 20 plus 0–4.5 mm metal salt), and buffer G (buffer F minus metal salt). 1 mg/ml p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 10% (v/v) diethanolamine, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.8, was used for the ELISA substrate. All incubation periods for the CD9-FN-binding ELISA lasted 2 h at room temperature unless indicated. Immulon I (VWR International, Bristol, CT) microtiter plate wells were coated with CD9 (2 μg/ml), His6-rCD9 (2 μg/ml), BSA (10 μg/ml), or peptide (10 μm) in buffer A. After one wash with buffer B, plates were blocked with blocking buffer 1. 1% BSA was included in steps from ligand overlay to addition of mAb conjugate to minimize nonspecific binding. Titrations of human plasma FN in buffer B were added to plates either alone or, in the case of competition ELISAs, with 0–160 μm synthetic peptide. Plates were washed three times with ELISA buffer B, followed by incubation with a 1/1000 dilution of rabbit anti-FN antibody. After two washes with buffer B and one wash with buffer C, plates were incubated with 1/500 anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase in buffer C for 1 h at room temperature. After four washes with buffer C, 1 mg/mlp-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate was added and the absorbance at 405 nm was recorded. The standard ELISA assay format was modified to evaluate the effects of divalent and monovalent metal salts on the FN-CD9 interaction. The ELISA buffers contained 0.5 mm EGTA, and metal salt was excluded from antigen plating and the primary wash step. Antigen was plated in buffer D. The plates were washed once with buffer E and then blocked with blocking buffer 2. Subsequent steps up to and including the second wash after the FN overlay were done in buffer F, which contained 0–4.5 mm metal salt. After the FN overlay, plates were washed once with buffer F (with or without metal salt), then twice with buffer G. The subsequent incubations and washes were performed with buffer G. CD9 cDNA (bp 153–839) was PCR-amplified from the lF-5 clone (17Lanza F. Wolf D. Fox C.F. Kieffer N. Seyer J.M. Fried V.A. Coughlin S.R. Phillips D.R Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10638-10645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the PCR product (rCD9) was sequenced using the dideoxy-chain termination method. The purified rCD9 cDNA was ligated into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen) and transfected into Escherichia coli (SG13009). His6-rCD9 was expressed, and recombinant CD9 protein was purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The isolation and cloning of CD9 cDNA into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (pRc/CMVCD9) has been described previously (17Lanza F. Wolf D. Fox C.F. Kieffer N. Seyer J.M. Fried V.A. Coughlin S.R. Phillips D.R Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10638-10645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A CHO cell clone transfected with pRc/CMVCD9 was designated CD9-CHO-N3 (17Lanza F. Wolf D. Fox C.F. Kieffer N. Seyer J.M. Fried V.A. Coughlin S.R. Phillips D.R Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10638-10645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second CD9 CHO cell clone, CD9-CHO-A6, was generated for this study using the pRc/CMVCD9 plasmid as described previously (17Lanza F. Wolf D. Fox C.F. Kieffer N. Seyer J.M. Fried V.A. Coughlin S.R. Phillips D.R Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10638-10645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The strategy for the deletion of the CD9 EC2 and TM4 regions (Δ113–228) has been described elsewhere (13Cook G.A. Wilkinson D.A. Crossno J.T., Jr. Raghow R. Jennings L.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 356-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide primers used to construct the CD9 EC2 truncation cDNAs were designed according to the reported CD9 nucleotide sequence (17Lanza F. Wolf D. Fox C.F. Kieffer N. Seyer J.M. Fried V.A. Coughlin S.R. Phillips D.R Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10638-10645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These oligonucleotide primers were used in PCR amplifications using full-length CD9 cDNA as a template to generate mutant CD9 cDNAs. Three PCR amplifications were used to construct CD9 EC2 deletions. The first PCR was done using full-length CD9 cDNA as a template with a CD9 SphI 5′ primer (5′-CAGTGCATGCTGGGACTGTTCTTCGGCTTC-3′) containing theSphI site at position +416 in the CD9 open reading frame with either 3′ Δ133–192 (5′-TGCGCCGATGATGTGGAACAGCTTGTTGTAGGT-3′), 3′ Δ152–192 (5′-GCCGATGATGTGGAAGTTCAACGCATAGTG-3′) or 3′ Δ173–192 (5′-GCCGATGATGTGGAATACGTCCTTCTTGGG-3′) primers generating 154-, 208-, and 271-bp fragments, respectively. The second PCR was done using full-length CD9 cDNA as a template with a 3′ ApaI primer (homologous to the pRc/CMV vector backbone sequence) with either 5′ Δ133–192 (5′-ACCTACAACAAGCTGTTCCACATCATCGGCGCA-3′), 5′ Δ152–192 (5′-CACTATGCGTTGAACTTCCACATCATCGGC-3′), or 5′ Δ173–192 (5′-CCCAAGAAGGACGTATTCCACATCATCGGC-3′) primers, respectively, generating a 611-bp fragment in each case. For the third PCR amplification, corresponding overlapping PCR products were utilized as templates and extended for 15 cycles, after which CD9SphI and ApaI primers were used for an additional 30 cycles to generate CD9 EC2 internal deletion products of 765 bp for Δ133–192, 819 bp for Δ152–192, and 882 bp for Δ173–192. These PCR products were cleaved withSphI and ApaI and subcloned into the pBSSKCD9 vector backbone from which the SphI/ApaI portion of the CD9 cDNA/vector sequence had been removed generating complete CD9 cDNAs with the targeted regions in CD9 EC2 missing. The CD9 EC2 truncation cDNAs were subcloned into the original pRc/CMVCD9 construct from which the full-length CD9 cDNA had been removed. The fmole DNA sequencing system (Promega, Madison, WI) was used to obtain and confirm CD9 EC2 truncation cDNA sequences. In summary, Δ133–192, Δ152–192, and Δ173–192 CD9 cDNAs had truncations of 180 bp (60 aa), 123 bp (41 aa), and 60 bp (20 aa) in CD9 EC2, respectively. To construct Δ23 CD9 cDNA with an internal deletion of 72 nucleotides (24 aa) spanning CD9 EC1, a 686-bpBamHI/PstI fragment of CD9 encoding CD9 cDNA was amplified using pRc/CMVCD9 as a template using DAWfor (5′-GGATCCATGCCGGTCAAAGG-3′) and DAWrev (5′-CTGCAGCTAGACCATCTCGC-3′) primers. This fragment was digested with BamHI andPstI and cloned into complementary sites in the vector pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) yielding the pGDAW construct. To delete CD9 EC1, pGDAW was amplified using DAWfor and Δ23rev (5′-GACTCCTGTCCATAGTCCAAT-3′) primers. The Δ23rev primer contained a T323-C254 nucleotide junction in the CD9 sequence. 5 μl of the first PCR product was mixed with 1 ng of pGDAW plasmid and subjected to one PCR cycle of 5 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 37 °C, and 10 min at 70 °C. The product of the second PCR was then amplified for 30 cycles using DAWfor and DAWrev primers generating the 617-bp BamHI/PstI CD9 EC1 deletion fragment. The CD9 EC1 deletion product was digested withBamHI and PstI and cloned into the complementary sites of the plasmid pGEM-T thus generating pGAW/D35. The pGAW/D35 plasmid was grown and purified from E. coli. A 617-bpBamHI/PstI fragment from pGAW/D35 was isolated and subcloned into the BamHI/PstI site of pcDNA3.1Zeo to generate pcDNA/Δ23. The REP4CD9 expression vector was made by amplification of CD9 cDNA by PCR using pRc/CMVCD9 as a template and primers CD9for (5′-GATCAAGCTTATGCCGGTCAAAGG-3′) and CD9rev (5′-GATCGGATCCCTAGACCATCTCGC-3′) containingHindIII and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The resulting DNA amplified by PCR was digested withHindIII and BamHI and cloned homologous sites of the pREP4 vector. Wild type CHO cells were grown to 50–70% confluency in six-well tissue culture plates (Corning Glass, Corning, NY) containing 3 × 105 cells/well. Cells were rinsed once with serum-free RPMI 1640 and transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer’s protocol. At 72 h post-transfection, cells were passed 1:10 in selective growth media supplemented with 750 μg/ml Geneticin G418 or 1 mg/ml Zeocin, and stable transfectants were selected. Two mock control transfections were done, “Mock” for pRc/CMV and “Mock-Zeo” for PcDNA3.1Zeo. The heterogenous populations of CD9-expressing CHO cells CD9-CHO-H1, CD9-CHO-H2, and REP4-CD9-CHO were made by electroporation with either pRc/CMVCD9 or pREP4CD9 for REP4-CD9-CHO cells. Briefly, washed CHO cells were resuspended at 5 × 107 in PBS, mixed with 20 μg of the appropriate plasmid DNA, and pulsed at 500 V, 900 microfarads, and 125 ohms using a ECM 630 electro-cell manipulator (BTX, San Diego, CA). Stable CD9-expressing CHO cells were selected by growth in the presence of either 750 μg/ml Geneticin for pRc/CMVCD9 or 400 μg/ml hygromycin for pREP4CD9-transfected CHO cells. Cell cycle-synchronized cultures were used for all assays. CD9- or Mock-CHO cells were enriched at the GO/G1 stage by the seeding of confluent cells at 2 × 106 cells/75-cm2 flask and harvesting at 50–70% confluency. All Mock-transfected or CD9-transfected CHO K1 cells were maintained in media A supplemented with either 750 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) or 1 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) depending on expression vector selection marker. The heterogenous CHO cell line transfected with pREP4CD9 was grown in media A supplemented with 400 μg/ml hygromycin. The motility assays were performed using two methodologies. The first method was modified from Bauer et al. (18Bauer J.S. Schreiner C.L. Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cell cycle-synchronized CHO cells were seeded into tissue culture plates, grown to ∼50% confluency, and harvested. The cells were washed twice with media A, adjusted to 4 × 105/ml, allowed to rest at 37 °C for 30 min in media B, then transferred into modified Boyden chambers. The upper and lower chambers were separated by a polycarbonate filter with 8-μm pores, pre-coated on the underside only with 10 μg/ml FN. After 3 or 6 h, cells on the FN-coated side of the filters were fixed, stained with hematoxylin, and mounted onto slides. The total numbers of adherent cells from five high powered fields (HPF) per filter were counted per time point per assay. The second method for assessing the motility of CD9-transfected CHO cells utilized 10-mm polycarbonate tissue culture inserts with 8-μm pores (Nunc, Rochester, NY). Tissue culture inserts were coated on the underside with FN as described above for Boyden chambers. For peptide inhibition studies FN-coated tissue culture inserts were coated with either peptide 6 or scrambled peptide control (referred to as 6S) at 0.5 μm in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C and allowed to dry at 4 °C overnight. 300 μl of media B was added to each well of a 24-well culture plate (Nunc, Rochester, NY), and a coated tissue culture insert was placed in each well. CHO cells were cell synchronized, harvested, and prepared as described for Boyden chamber motility experiments. 400 μl (3 × 105 cells/ml) of CHO cell suspension was added per coated tissue culture insert. CHO cells were allowed to migrate for 3 or 6 h at 37 °C. CHO cells, adhered to the FN-coated underside of tissue culture inserts, were stained with Wright Giemsa, and the number of adherent cells in five random high power fields were counted per time point per assay. Comparison studies confirmed that there were no significant differences in the extent of CHO cell motility between the two methods described (data not shown). CHO cell adhesion assays were done as described by Cook et al. (13Cook G.A. Wilkinson D.A. Crossno J.T., Jr. Raghow R. Jennings L.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 356-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, 24-well cell culture plates (Corning, Acton, MA) were coated with FN (10 μg/ml) and blocked with PBS, 3% BSA. CHO cells were cell synchronized, harvested, and resuspended at 1 × 105 cell/ml in adhesion media (RPMI, 1% BSA). For peptide inhibition studies, peptides were added to CHO cell suspension to give a final concentration of 0.5 μm, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 1-ml CHO cell suspension was added to each well, and CHO cells were allowed to adhere for either 3 or 6 h when adherent cells were stained with Wright Giemsa and counted. As previous studies had suggested a role for CD9 in cell adhesion and spreading on FN (13Cook G.A. Wilkinson D.A. Crossno J.T., Jr. Raghow R. Jennings L.K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 356-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), we assayed purified CD9 for FN binding activity. The interaction between CD9 and FN was stimulated by CaCl2 (Fig.1A). Although other cations, including Na+ and K+, had no effect on CD9-FN interaction, Mg2+ showed some enhancement of CD9-FN binding (data not shown). Half-maximal binding was seen at ∼1 mmCaCl2. The counterion did not appear to influence the effect of Ca2+ on CD9-FN binding (data not shown). In the presence of 2.5 mm CaCl2, half-maximal binding of soluble FN to immobilized CD9 was seen at 35.6 ± 11 μg/ml (8.1 ± 2.5 × 10−8m) FN. Representative CD9-FN interactions in the presence of 2.5 mm CaCl2 are shown in Fig. 1B. In the absence of Ca2+ ions, the binding is lower, and saturation is not reached at 200 μg/ml FN (data not shown). The binding of FN to purified platelet CD9 was compared with bacterially expressed histidine tagged CD9 (His6-rCD9) and BSA (Fig.1B). The absolute values from ELISA showed that the binding of His6-rCD9 to FN was 40% lower than for purified CD9; however, half-maximal binding between His6-rCD9 and FN was 120 nm FN, close to the value obtained for purified CD9 (81 ± 25 nm). To address the specificity of the CD9-FN interaction, peptides corresponding to different regions of CD9 EC2 were assayed for FN binding activity (Fig. 2A). Peptide 5 (YKDTYNKLKTKDEPQRETLKAI) and Peptide 6 (PKKDVLETFTVKSCPDAIKEVFDNK) correspond to CD9 EC2 amino acids 125–146 and 168–192, respectively. When compared with intact platelet-purified CD9, soluble FN had significant binding to peptide 6 (65%) compared with 19% for peptide 5. Competition ELISAs were used to examine the effects of the CD9 peptides on the binding of FN to CD9 (Fig. 2B). Peptide 6 significantly inhibited the binding of FN to CD9 where maximal inhibition was seen at 60 μm peptide (Fig.2C). To demonstrate that CD9 was able to bind to FN in a whole cell system, CHO-B2 cells lacking integrin α5β1 expression were transfected with CD9, and their ability to adhere to FN was compared with CHO-B2 Mock transfectants. CD9 expression induced a significant increase in CHO-B2 adhesion to FN (Fig. 2D). In support of our observations in a purified ELISA system, peptide 6, unlike scrambled control peptide 6S, was able to block the enhanced CD9-CHO-B2 cell adhesion to FN demonstrating that CD9 was responsible for this effect. These data demonstrate that CD9 can act as an FN receptor in a cellular context. The CD9-CHO-N3 clonal cell line was isolated from CHO cells transfected with pRc/CMVCD9 (17Lanza F. Wolf D. Fox C.F. Kieffer N. Seyer J.M. Fried V.A. Coughlin S.R. Phillips D.R Jennings L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10638-10645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Polycarbonate filters coated with either fibrinogen or BSA had no adhered CD9-CHO-N3 cells in motility assays after 6 h (data not shown). The CD9-CHO-A6 clone described in this study was derived from CHO cells transfected with pRc/CMVCD9. Both CD9-CHO-N3 and CD9-CHO-A6 cell clones had high surface expression of CD9 as demonstrated by flow cytometry. For example, over 93% of CD9-CHO-A6 cells expressed CD9 with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 760 on labeling with mAb7 compared with Mock-CHO cells with an MFI of 6.7. To demonstrate that CD9 effects on CHO cell motility were not due to aberrant clones, two clonally heterogenous populations of CD9-expressing CHO cells were generated. Both CD9-CHO-H1 and CD9-CHO-H2 had equivalent CD9 cell surface density seen with clones CD9-CHO-A6 and CD9-CHO-N3 (data not shown). Additionally, a heterogenous CD9-expressing CHO cell population was produced using the pREP4CD9 expression vector. CD9-CHO-REP4 expressed CD9 with an MFI of 46, demonstrating that CD9-CHO-REP4 cells expressed significantly less CD9 than the clonal or heterogenous CD9-expressing CHO cells transfected with the pRc/CMVCD9 expression construct. To assess the influence of CD9 on cell motility, we compared the haptotactic motility of Mock and CD9-CHO cells to FN in modified Boyden chambers. CD9-CHO cells had a 5-fold increase in their motility when compared with Mock-CHO cells (Fig. 3). CD9-CHO-H1 and CD9-CHO H2 had the same enhancement of CHO cell motility to FN as seen with CD9-CHO-A6 (Fig. 3), demonstrating that aberrant CHO cell clones were not responsible for the changes in CHO cell motility. Additionally, CD9-CHO-REP4 had a 45% reduction in haptotactic motility to FN as compared with the other CD9-expressing CHO cell lines (Fig.3). These data point to a direct relationship between CD9 cell surface density and the enhancement of CHO cell motility to FN. Overall, we conclude that CD9 expression on CHO cells is associated with increased haptotac"
https://openalex.org/W2057513484,"The abilities of the M3muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) and Rac1 to regulate similar cellular responses, including cadherin-mediated adhesion, prompted us to investigate Rac1 regulation by M3 mAChR. We characterized changes in Rac1 induced by stimulating transfected M3 mAChR in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type or mutant Rac1. mAChR activation converts endogenous Rac1 to the GTP-bound form in cells expressing HA-Rac1 but not in cells expressing dominant negative HA-Rac1Asn-17 or constitutively active HA-Rac1Val-12. The competitive binding of endogenous IQGAP1 by HA-Rac1Val-12 may diminish the mAChR-mediated activation of endogenous Rac1. HA-Rac1 and HA-Rac1Val-12, but not HA-Rac1Asn-17, accumulate with IQGAP1 at cell junctions during mAChR-induced cell-cell compaction. Co-localization studies suggest that Rac1 can accumulate at junctions without IQGAP1, but IQGAP1 cannot accumulate at junctions without Rac1. mAChR activation also induces GTP-independent changes in Rac1 because mAChR activation redistributes HA-Rac1Asn-17, which does not bind GTP. Actin associates with complexes containing HA-Rac1 or HA-Rac1Val-12 after prolonged mAChR activation. We also demonstrate that Rac1 participates in mAChR-induced cell-cell compaction and c-Jun phosphorylation.

The participation of Rac1 in the cadherin-mediated adhesion of epithelial and endothelial cells indicates that Rac1 signaling cascades may also regulate wound healing and vascular permeability (reviewed in Refs. 7Evers E.

In many instances, activation of heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) initiates these Rac1-dependent cellular responses (1Schmitz U. Thommes K. Beier I. Wagner W. Sachinidis A. Dusing R.

Activation of GPCR stimulates the conversion of Rac from the GDP-bound form to the GTP-bound form (1Schmitz U. Thommes K. Beier I. Wagner W. Sachinidis A. Dusing R. Vetter H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22003-22010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 10Benard V. Bohl B. Bokoch G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). In addition to this event, GPCR activation undoubtedly induces additional uncharacterized changes in Rac1, such as altered interactions with protein partners or translocation to unique intracellular sites that promote the participation of Rac1 in these different signaling pathways. However, little is known regarding the concurrent changes in GTP binding activity, protein interactions, and subcellular localization of Rac1, which are induced by GPCR activation. The M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is a likely candidate to regulate Rac1 activity in a variety of cell types. The M3 mAChR and the closely related M1 mAChR are GPCR that are expressed in a wide variety of cells including smooth muscle cells, neurons, and epithelial and endothelial cells (reviewed in Ref. 11Shafer S. Puhl H. Phelps S. Williams C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Activation of M3 mAChR induces several cellular responses that may involve Rac1 including JNK activation (12Wylie P. Challiss R. Blank J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), reactive oxygen species generation (13Naarala J. Tervo P. Loikkanen J. Svolainen K. Life Sci. 1997; 60: 1905-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), smooth muscle contraction (reviewed in Ref. 14Strassheim D. May L. Varker K. Puhl H. Phelps S. Porter R. Aronstam R. Noti J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Many of these responses have important physiological effects. For example, smooth muscle contraction induced by M3 mAChR activation significantly alters pulmonary and cardiovascular function (reviewed in Refs. 16Van Zwieten P. Doods H. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 1995; 9: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar and 17White M. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1995; 95: 1065-1068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The induction of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion by M3 mAChR activation in lung carcinoma cells may diminish metastatic potential (reviewed in Refs. 11Shafer S. Puhl H. Phelps S. Williams C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar and 15Williams C.L. Hayes V. Hummel A. Tarara J. Halsey T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The M3mAChR-mediated activation of JNK (12Wylie P. Challiss R. Blank J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) may play an important role in AP-1-mediated transcription in a variety of cell types (reviewed in Ref. 18Herdegen T. Waetzig V. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2424-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The probability that these M3mAChR-dependent functions involve Rac1 provides a strong rationale for investigating how M3 mAChR activation alters Rac1. Potential participants in the M3 mAChR-mediated activation of Rac1 include IQGAP1 and the Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor RhoGDI. IQGAP1, which derives its name from the presence of several IQ domains and some sequence similarity to GTPase-activating proteins, binds multiple proteins in addition to Rac1, including Cdc42, calmodulin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, and actin (reviewed in Ref. 19Swart-Mataraza J., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24753-24763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 may promote Rac1 activation by diminishing Rac1 GTPase activity and by preventing active Rac1 from interacting with negative regulators (reviewed in Ref. 20Machesky L.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R202-R205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, RhoGDI may impede Rac1 activation by diminishing the ability of Rac1-GDP to convert to Rac1-GTP (reviewed in Ref. 21Olofsson B. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Thus, M3 mAChR-mediated changes in the interactions of Rac1 with IQGAP1 or RhoGDI may contribute to Rac1 activation. We are using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with M3 mAChR (CHO-m3 cells) to help define how M3mAChR may activate Rac1. M3 mAChR-mediated responses in these cells resemble those induced by activating endogenous M3 mAChR in other cell types. For example, M3mAChR activation affects actin/myosin interactions in CHO-m3 cells as it does in smooth muscle cells (reviewed in Ref. 14Strassheim D. May L. Varker K. Puhl H. Phelps S. Porter R. Aronstam R. Noti J. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18675-18685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cadherin-mediated adhesion induced by M3 mAChR activation in CHO-m3 cells (11Shafer S. Puhl H. Phelps S. Williams C.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 148-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) mimics almost exactly cadherin-mediated adhesion induced by activating endogenous M3 mAChR in lung carcinoma cells (15Williams C.L. Hayes V. Hummel A. Tarara J. Halsey T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These similarities indicate that CHO-m3 cells are a reasonable model system to investigate how M3 mAChR activation affects Rac1. The M3 mAChR preferentially couples to heterotrimeric G proteins in the Gq/11 family (reviewed in Ref. 12Wylie P. Challiss R. Blank J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of Rac1 by other GPCR that preferentially couple to Gq/11 proteins, such as receptors for angiotensin-II (1Schmitz U. Thommes K. Beier I. Wagner W. Sachinidis A. Dusing R.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1343-1355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may involve changes in Rac1 similar to those that are induced by M3 mAChR activation. We found that M3 mAChR activation profoundly affects both endogenous Rac1 and hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged wild-type and mutant Rac1 proteins that were stably transfected in these CHO-m3 cells. The M3 mAChR-dependent activation of Rac1 involves the conversion of Rac1 to the GTP-bound form, altered interactions between Rac1, IQGAP1, and actin, and translocation of Rac1 and IQGAP1 to cell junctions. These changes in Rac1 affect specific M3mAChR-dependent signaling pathways because expression of dominant negative HA-Rac1Asn-17 inhibits the M3mAChR-dependent compaction of the cells and activation of JNK but not the activation of extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-1 and ERK-2. These results help define the changes in Rac1 that allow it to participate in M3 mAChR-dependent signaling. Antibodies to Rac1, IQGAP1, RhoGDI (Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), HA (Covance, Berkeley, CA), calmodulin (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and actin (amino acids 20–33) (Sigma) were used in the assays. The sc-94 antibody (recognizing ERK-1 and ERK-2) and the sc-7383 antibody (recognizing phosphorylated ERK-1 and ERK-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The pEF-BOS-HA-Rac1 and pEF-BOS-HA-Rac1Val-12 plasmids coding for HA-tagged wild-type Rac1 or constitutively active Rac1Val-12, respectively, were a gift from Dr. Shinya Kuroda (Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Nara, Japan). The pEF-BOS-HA-Rac1Asn-17 plasmid coding for HA-tagged dominant negative Rac1Asn-17 was generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (14Strassheim D. May L. Varker K. Puhl H.

CHO-m3 cells were co-transfected with one of these plasmids and the pZeoSV2 plasmid coding for zeocin resistance (Invitrogen) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen).

These sublines also test negative for Mycoplasma contamination, as indicated by the inability to amplify Mycoplasma mRNA from the cells using the polymerase chain reaction. All cells were maintained in complete medium consisting of Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (5%), glutamine (0.3 μg/ml), penicillin (20 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (20 μg/ml). Cells were cultured for 16 h in either complete medium or labeling medium consisting of methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco’s modified essential medium, [35S]methionine (10 μCi/ml), and 2% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and then incubated in the absence or presence of 10 μm carbachol. In the experiments shown in Fig. 1, cells were collected from the culture plates before they were lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μmleupeptin, pH 7.4) containing phosphatase inhibitors (22Strassheim D.

In the experiments shown in Fig. 8, the cells were scraped from the culture plates in the presence of this lysis buffer. The lysates were centrifuged (13,000 × g, 10 min, 4° C), and the resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated as described previously (22Strassheim D. Porter R. Phelps S. Williams C.L. J. Biol.

Peptide sequencing of immunoprecipitated IQGAP1 was performed using previously described techniques (22Strassheim D. Porter R. Phelps S. Williams C.L. J. Biol.

The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. A representative autoradiograph from three independent experiments is shown. An enlargement of lanes 1–4 from this autoradiograph (B) shows proteins that co-precipitated with HA-Rac1 (lanes 1–3) and IQGAP1 (lane 4) with relative molecular masses of ∼200 kDa. C, constitutively active HA-Rac1Val-12 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of35S-labeled m3CARac cells that were incubated with 10 μm carbachol for the indicated times. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The smear of proteins with apparent relative molecular masses of ∼116 kDa in all lanes is a nonspecific effect and does not reflect the actual co-precipitation of these proteins. Aside from this nonspecific effect, the autoradiograph is representative of three independent experiments.D, the indicated HA-tagged Rac1 or Rac1Val-12proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of m3WTRac cells treated with carbachol (10 μm, 90 min) (lanes 1–4) or from m3CARac cells treated with carbachol (10 μm, 30 min) (lanes 5–8). The immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with antibody to HA (lanes 1and5), RhoGDI (lanes 2and 6), or actin at antibody dilutions of 1:25 (lanes 3and7) and 1:50 (lanes 4and 8).

(22Strassheim D. Porter R. Phelps S. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6699-6702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The particulate fractions of the cells were incubated (10 min, 30° C) with buffer containing 150 nm [35S]GTPγS (1 mCi/mmol), solubilized with detergent, and centrifuged (13,000 ×g, 10 min, 4° C). The resulting supernatants were immunoprecipitated with antibody to HA, and the amounts of [35S]GTPγS bound to the immunoprecipitated HA-tagged Rac1 proteins were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Assays were performed as described by Ren et al. (23Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) using a bacterial expression vector coding for GST-PBD (10Benard V. Bohl B. Bokoch G. J. Biol.

The cells were subjected to a −70° C freeze/thaw cycle, incubated with the indicated drugs (3 min, 37° C), and lysed in lysis buffer (23Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). The lysates were incubated with bacterially expressed GST-PBD followed by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, as described previously (20Machesky L.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R202-R205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The precipitates were subjected to ECL-Western blotting using antibodies to Rac1 or HA. Densitometry of the samples in the ECL-Western blots was performed to quantify the relative amounts of endogenous Rac1 and HA-tagged Rac1 proteins that co-precipitated with GST-PBD. Optical density values higher than 2.4 may not accurately indicate the relative amounts of proteins in the samples because these values are above the maximum densitometry detection limit. Immunofluorescence assays were conducted as described previously (22Strassheim D. Porter R. Phelps S. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6699-6702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips and incubated with 10 μm carbachol, fixed in formaldehyde (3%, 15 min, 4° C), and permeabilized in Triton X-100 (0.2%, 10 min, 25° C). The cells were incubated with mouse or rabbit antibody to HA or mouse antibody to IQGAP1. After washing, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. The cells were washed, mounted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 90% glycerol and 0.1% p-phenylenediamine, and examined using a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope. Phosphorylation of c-Jun was assayed as described by Wylie et al. (12Wylie P. Challiss R. Blank J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using a bacterial expression vector for GST-tagged c-Jun (amino acids 5–89) (24Adler V. Polotskaya A. Wagner F. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17001-17005Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was provided by Dr. Andrew Kraft (University of Colorado). Cells were incubated with 10 μm carbachol and lysed (12Wylie P. Challiss R. Blank J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed GST-c-Jun was incubated (1 h, 4° C) with the cleared lysates in the presence of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, precipitated, and incubated (20 min, 30° C) with kinase buffer (12Wylie P. Challiss R. Blank J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) containing 100 μCi/ml [32P]ATP (4.5 mCi/mmol). The samples were boiled in sample buffer for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Densitometry of the samples in the autoradiographs was performed to quantify the levels of c-Jun phosphorylation. Cells were incubated with 10 μm carbachol and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors as described above. The cleared supernatants were subjected to ECL-Western blotting using antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of ERK-1 and ERK-2. Densitometry of the samples in the ECL-Western blots was performed to quantify the levels of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated ERK-1 and ERK-2. To examine the regulation of Rac1 by M3 mAChR, CHO-m3 sublines stably expressing HA-tagged wild-type or mutant Rac1 proteins were established. The m3WTRac cell line expresses wild-type HA-Rac1, the m3CARac cell line expresses constitutively active HA-Rac1Val-12, and the m3DNRac cell line expresses dominant negative HA-Rac1Asn-17. To test the expectation that these wild-type and mutant HA-tagged Rac1 proteins have different rates of GTP binding and hydrolysis, we measured the binding of [35S]GTPγS by the HA-tagged GTPases expressed in the cells. Although significant levels of [35S]GTPγS are bound by both HA-Rac1 and HA-Rac1Val-12, less [35S]GTPγS is bound by HA-Rac1Val-12 than by HA-Rac1 (Fig.1A). This finding is consistent with constitutively active HA-Rac1Val-12 having a slower rate of GTP hydrolysis, which would result in a slower rate of [35S]GTPγS binding. As expected, dominant negative HA-Rac1Asn-17 binds minimal levels of [35S]GTPγS (Fig. 1A). To examine the protein interactions of the HA-tagged wild-type and mutant Rac1 proteins, the HA-tagged GTPases were immunoprecipitated from 35S-labeled cells and examined for co-precipitating proteins (Fig. 1B). For comparison HA-tagged wild-type RhoA, constitutively active RhoAVal-14, and dominant negative RhoAAsn-19 were also immunoprecipitated from35S-labeled stably transfected CHO-m3 sublines that we established previously (14Strassheim D. May L. Varker K. Puhl H. Phelps S. Porter R. Aronstam R. Noti J. Williams C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18675-18685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 was identified as the 195-kDa protein that co-precipitates with HA-Rac1Val-12 and to a lesser extent with HA-Rac1 (Fig. 1B). Enzymatic digestion and peptide sequencing of this 195-kDa protein yielded a peptide with the sequence LPYDVTPEQA, which corresponds to residues 1112–1121 of murine IQGAP1 (Swiss-Prot accession number Q9JKF1). The identification of this protein as IQGAP1 was further indicated by its reaction with IQGAP1 antibodies in ECL-Western blots of immunoprecipitated HA-Rac1Val-12 (Fig. 1C). The inability of IQGAP1 to co-precipitate with HA-Rac1Asn-17 or the HA-tagged RhoA proteins (Fig. 1B) is consistent with the report that IQGAP1 preferentially associates with the GTP-bound form of Rac1 and does not associate with RhoA (25Hart M.J. Callow M. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Two proteins that co-precipitate with HA-Rac1Val-12 and to a much lesser extent with HA-Rac1 have approximate relative molecular masses of 19 and 16 kDa (Fig. 1B). Several lines of evidence indicate that these two proteins are calmodulin. Calmodulin reportedly migrates on SDS gels with relative molecular masses of 21 and 15 kDa when the protein is Ca2+-free and -bound, respectively (reviewed in Ref. 26Rogers M. Strehler E.E. Celio M. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Calmodulin: Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, New York1996: 34-40Google Scholar). Calmodulin also physically associates with IQGAP1, which has three binding sites for Ca2+-free calmodulin and one binding site for Ca2+-bound calmodulin (reviewed in Ref. 27Ho Y. Joyal J., Li, Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 464-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The ratio of IQGAP1/19-kDa protein/16-kDa protein is 1:0.57 ± 0.09:0.23 ± 0.05 in HA-Rac1Val-12 immunoprecipitates (n = 5 independent experiments). These proteins are present in a similar ratio of 1:0.47 ± 0.08:0.24 ± 0.05 in HA-Rac1 immunoprecipitates, even though much less IQGAP1 co-precipitates with HA-Rac1 than with HA-Rac1Val-12 (n = 5 independent experiments). These similar ratios support the possibility that the 19- and 16-kDa proteins are Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound calmodulin, respectively, associated with IQGAP1. This possibility is further supported by the demonstration that calmodulin antibodies recognize the 19-kDa protein in immunoprecipitates of HA-Rac1Val-12 (Fig. 1D, top panel). The lack of detectable reactivity of these antibodies with the 16-kDa protein may be because of an inability of the calmodulin antibodies to recognize Ca2+-bound calmodulin. RhoGDI was identified by ECL-Western blotting (Fig. 1C) as the 28-kDa protein that co-precipitates with HA-Rac1 and to a lesser extent with HA-Rac1Val-12 (Fig. 1B). The ratio of HA-Rac1/RhoGDI is 1:1.14 ± 0.07 in HA-Rac1 immunoprecipitates from m3WTRac cells, whereas the ratio of HA-Rac1Val-12/RhoGDI is 1:0.44 ± 0.06 in HA-Rac1Val-12 immunoprecipitates from m3CARac cells (n = 5 independent experiments). Undetectable amounts of RhoGDI co-precipitate with HA-Rac1Asn-17 or HA-RhoAAsn-19 (Fig. 1B). We hypothesized that Rac1 associates with IQGAP1 and RhoGDI in two mutually exclusive complexes. This hypothesis was tested by comparing immunoprecipitates of IQGAP1, RhoGDI, and HA-Rac1Val-12from m3CARac cells. Immunoprecipitates of RhoGDI contain neither calmodulin nor proteins that co-migrate with IQGAP1 (Fig.1E). Conversely, immunop"

We have reported that the rhythmic expression of Gts1p is important for the maintenance of ultradian rhythms. Structurally, Gts1p contains sequence motifs similar to N-degron and the ubiquitin association domain, raising the possibility that the Gts1p level is regulated by degradation via ubiquitination. When the lysine residue at the putative ubiquitination site of the N-degron was substituted with arginine, both the protein level and half-life of mutant Gts1p increased. During continuous culture, the protein level of the mutant Gts1p was elevated and did not fluctuate, leading to the disappearance of metabolic oscillation within a day. Furthermore, using three Gts1ps containing mutations in the ubiquitin association domain, we showed that the lower the binding activity of the mutant Gts1ps for polyubiquitin in vitro, the higher the protein level in vivo. Expression of the mutant Gts1ps in the continuous culture resulted in an increase in Gts1p and early loss of the oscillation. Therefore, Gts1p is degraded through conjugation with ubiquitin, and the UBA domain promoted the degradation of ubiquitinated Gts1p, causing a fluctuation in protein level, which is required for the maintenance of metabolic oscillations.

The energy metabolism pathway has been proven to be an autogenous oscillator under extreme nonequilibrium energy conditions according to the theory of “dissipative structures” established by Prigogine and others (5Prigogine I. Lefever R. Goldbeter A. Herschkowitz-Kaufman M. Nature. 1969; 223: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 6Goldbeter A. Biochemical Oscillations and Cellular Rhythms.

John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1977: 334-354Google Scholar). In brief, the metabolic pathway oscillates autonomously under the primary control of phosphofructokinase, transferring energy from glucose to NADH, which acts as the feed-forward activator, and then from NADH to ATP, which acts as the feedback inhibitor. After ATP as an inhibitor is consumed as fuel for various ATPases, glucose again begins to enter the glycolytic pathway. The oscillations are detectable as a periodic change in the factors involved in energy metabolism such as dissolved oxygen (DO)1 levels, CO2production, glucose and ethanol concentrations, and amounts of storage carbohydrates. DO oscillation is due to the periodic change between respiratory and respiro-fermentative phases in which oxygen demands are relatively high and low, respectively. DO oscillations arise spontaneously in concert with cell division and are dependent on a high cell density (∼5 × 108 cells/ml), regulating the cell density throughout the oscillation (8Wang J. Liu W. Uno T. Tonozuka H. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 9-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have reported that cellular responses to various stress conditions, such as heat, oxidative agents, and cytotoxic compounds, are regulated in concert with metabolic oscillation (8Wang J. Liu W. Uno T. Tonozuka H. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 189: 9-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the coupling 2In this report, the term “coupling” is used to refer to a state in which multiple oscillators fluctuate with the same periodicity irrespective of phase. was disrupted by inactivation of the GTS1 gene (9Wang J. Liu W. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we suggested that the rhythmic expression of Gts1p is more important than protein level for the maintenance of ultradian rhythms, since the constitutive expression of GTS1 under the control of the TPIpromoter resulted in the disappearance of ultradian rhythms (9Wang J. Liu W. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recently, we reported that, when GTS1 was expressed under the control of a short (183-bp) promoter in theGTS1-disrupted mutant, the amplitude of Gts1p fluctuations was restricted, leading to the attenuation of the metabolic oscillation and to the uncoupling of stress-resistance oscillations (10Tonozuka H. Wang J. Mitsui K. Saito T. Hamada Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, we suggested that, in order for stress resistance oscillations to occur, a full fluctuation in the level of Gts1p is required. Furthermore, we found that the mRNA level of GTS1 fluctuated with a broad peak at the respiro-fermentative phase, which is the opposite of the Gts1p fluctuation (10Tonozuka H. Wang J. Mitsui K. Saito T. Hamada Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that GTS1 expression was regulated in an oscillatory manner at the transcriptional level. However, it is likely that the oscillatory expression ofGTS1 is not sufficient to cause a fluctuation in the protein level, since the protein needs to be degraded for any subsequent increase to occur and/or for regulation of the protein level. In this paper, we examined whether the fluctuation in the level of Gts1p is controlled by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, since we found that Gts1p contains a putative N-degron (11Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and ubiquitin association (UBA) domain (12Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis at the sequence motifs, we examined the effects of mutations on the fluctuation in Gts1p expression and the oscillations in energy metabolism during continuous culture. The results suggested that the fluctuation in the level of Gts1p is regulated by the ubiquitination system in order to maintain the oscillations of energy metabolism, in combination with the oscillatory GTS1 expression at the transcriptional level. The haploid strain S288C (MATα mal gal2 SUC2) ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae was used. FL599 (ise1−) (13Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

In the batch cultures, cells were incubated at 30 °C in a synthetic medium consisting of a yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) containing 2% glucose with the required amino acids and bases. The cells were cultured at 30 °C, pH 5.5, in a synthetic medium containing 1% glucose as defined elsewhere (2Porro D. Martegani E. Ranzi B.M. Alberghina L. Biotechnol.

Similarly, constructs GTS1[MAQ] and GTS1[MGQ] were obtained using oligonucleotides MAQ and MGQ as 5′-primers (Table I), respectively, and inserted into pXY222 to give the recombinant plasmids pRSA-GTS1[MAQ] and pRSA-GTS1[MGQ]. After confirmation of the mutations in the mutant GTS1 genes in the recombinant plasmids, the transformation of gts1Δ cells proceeded. FL599 (ise1−) was cultured until the A600 value reached 1.0 and mixed with MG132 at a final concentration of 50 μm. After incubation for a specific period, cells were harvested, and the protein levels of Gts1p and actin in the cell lysates were determined by Western blotting as described previously (9Wang J. Liu W. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The relative protein level of Gts1p to actin was determined with a lumino-image analyzer (LAS1000; Fuji Film, Tokyo). Northern blotting of GTS1 andGTS1[K17R] mRNAs was performed using as probes digoxygenin-labeled PCR products amplified with the DIG labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using GTS-5′RI and GTS-3′Kpn (TableI) as 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. Actin mRNA was detected using the digoxygenin-labeled PCR product as probe, which was amplified using Actin-N and Actin-C (Table I) for 5′- and 3′-primers, respectively. The relative mRNA level of GTS1 to actin was determined with the lumino-image analyzer TheEcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the open reading frame of GTS1 without the stop codon was amplified on genomic DNA using GTS-5′RI and GTS-3′Hind as 5′- and 3′-primer, respectively, and inserted into the cognate sites of pYX222 containing the sequence of hemagglutinin (HA) epitope in a multicloning site (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). pYXHA-GTS1 carrying a fusion gene construct encoding Gts1p tagged with HA epitope at the C terminus was incorporated into gts1Δ. The transformed cells were harvested when the A600 of the culture reached 1.0 and cell lysate was prepared by shaking with glass beads in radioimmune precipitation buffer (9Wang J. Liu W. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The cell lysate was mixed with Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Berkeley, CA), and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody (Biogenesis, Poole, UK). The two-hybrid analysis was performed using a Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) as described previously (14Kawabata K. Mitsui K. Uno T. Tamura K. Tsurugi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The open reading frame of UBI4 encoding five ubiquitin proteins in a head-to-tail arrangement (15Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) was amplified on genomic DNA using UBI-5′RI and UBI-3′Sal (Table I) as 5′- and 3′-primer, respectively, and the EcoRI-SalI fragment from the PCR product was inserted into the cognate sites of pGAD424 in-frame with the gene encoding the activation domain of GAL4. On the other hand, the open reading frames of wild type and mutantGTS1 genes were amplified in the recombinant plasmid pRSA103 using GTS-5′RI and GTS-3′Sal (Table I) as 5′- and 3′-primer, respectively. The EcoRI-SalI fragments obtained from the PCR products were inserted into the cognate sites of pGTB9 in-frame with the gene encoding the DNA-binding domain ofGAL4. The interactions between the prey and bait hybrid proteins were determined for the activation of the lacZreporter gene by measuring the β-galactosidase activity of the cells using the liquid culture assay (14Kawabata K. Mitsui K. Uno T. Tamura K. Tsurugi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Gts1p contains two sequences homologous to ubiquitin-related motifs, N-degron and the UBA domain (Fig. 1). If the first methionine residue is removed from Gts1p in vivo, arginine, one of the destabilizing residues, is located at the N terminus and the ubiquitin-binding residue lysine occupies position 17. In addition, basic residues are present at positions 3 and 10, which have been reported to increase the efficiency of N-degron (16Suzuki T. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6017-6026Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the N-terminal sequence of Gts1p almost completely fits the consensus sequence of N-degron if the first methionine residue is removed. On the other hand, the UBA domain consists of about 40 amino acid residues comprising three α-helices linked by two loops (12Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Suyama M. Doerks T. Braun I.C. Sattler M. Izaurralde E. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The putative UBA domain in Gts1p has 80% homology to the consensus sequence including three well conserved amino acid residues (Gly-206, Leu-217, and Ala-227) (Fig. 1B). The presence of these sequences would suggest that Gts1p is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To test this possibility, the effect of the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG132 on the degradation of Gts1p was examined using FL599 (ise1−) cells having enhanced permeability to the drug (13Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis after the treatment with MG132in vivo showed that the Gts1p level had increased by more than 4-fold 4 h after the treatment with the drug (Fig.2), suggesting the involvement of proteasomes in the degradation of Gts1p. To investigate whether Gts1p binds ubiquitin in vivo, we first tried to detect ubiquitin-Gts1p conjugates in the wild type cells but could not detect any signals by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody in the immunoprecipitate with anti-Gts1p antibody (data not shown). Then we constructed a mutant overexpressing HA-tagged Gts1p (HA-Gts1p), named TMpHA-GTS1, since we thought that Gts1p-ubiquitin conjugates might be minor components. Western blot analysis of the cell lysate from TMpHA-GTS1 using anti-Gts1p showed that there are several signals in addition to the one corresponding to HA-Gts1p at 45 kDa (Fig.3A). Although the additional signals could not be found in the Western blot of cell lysate from the wild type cell, we thought that they are possibly some modified forms of Gts1p, since none of them was found in the cell lysate fromgts1Δ (Fig. 3A). To detect Gts1p-ubiquitin conjugates in TMpHA-GTS1, the cell lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and Gts1p-ubiquitin conjugates were detected in the immunoprecipitate by Western blotting using anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 3B). A major signal suggestive of Gts1p-ubiquitin conjugates had a molecular mass of 55 kDa, which corresponds approximately to that of HA-tagged Gts1p (45.6 kDa) conjugated with one molecule of ubiquitin (8.5 kDa) (Fig.3B, right lane). Since there is no band at the position corresponding to the 55-kDa signal in the Western blot of the original lysate obtained using anti-Gts1p antibody (Fig.3B, left lane), the 55-kDa conjugate is thought to be a minor component in the Gts1p population. In addition, none of the signals found in the Western blot of the lysate (Fig. 3, left lane) turned out to be a ubiquitin conjugate. At present, we do not know the nature of these signals. It should be pointed out that there are some minor bands stained like a smear in the high molecular weight region above the major band. Thus, the results suggested that Gts1p is conjugated with ubiquitin in a predominantly monoubiquitinated form. To examine whether the N-degron of Gts1p is involved in its degradation, a mutant Gts1p(K17R) containing arginine at position 17 instead of lysine was expressed in the GTS1-disrupted mutant, gts1Δ, and the level of Gts1p(K17R) was determined (Fig.4). The level was 2.4-fold that of the wild type protein, whereas the mRNA level was slightly decreased (0.8-fold), suggesting that the mutant Gts1p accumulated due to some deficiency at the step after transcription (Fig. 4). The half-lives of Gts1p and Gts1p(K17R) were then compared after the inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (Fig.5). The results showed that the half-life of Gts1p(K17R) was about 12 h, which is ∼4 times longer than that of the wild type Gts1p (3.5 h), suggesting that Gts1p(K17R) was accumulated due to a defect in degradation. Thus, the N-degron of Gts1p is probably involved in the degradation of Gts1p.Figure 5Effect of mutation at the putative ubiquitin-ligation site of N-degron of Gts1p on its own degradation rate. Time courses of the protein levels of Gts1p (A) and Gts1p(K17R) (B) relative to actin were determined by Western blotting after the treatment with cycloheximide. Cells were treated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide and incubated for specified periods. Half-lives of Gts1p and Gts1p(K17R) were estimated to be 3.5 and about 12 h, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the effect of the K17R mutation in Gts1p on the maintenance of the energy-metabolism oscillation monitored by measuring the concentration of DO in continuous culture (Fig.6). As we previously reported (9Wang J. Liu W. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the wild type Gts1p, expressed with the centromeric recombinant plasmid carrying GTS1[N-C] with its upstream region of about 1.0 kilobase pair rescued the metabolic oscillations lost ingts1Δ (Fig. 6A). The energy metabolism oscillation continued for about 4 days, although the amplitude of DO oscillation was about 30% lower than it was in the wild type cell (Table II). The Gts1p level oscillated at a level nearly identical to that of the wild type cell (data not shown) as reported previously (9). In contrast, the oscillation in gts1Δ cells expressing Gts1p(K17R) ceased within a day (Fig. 6B). The Gts1p(K17R) level was twice the peak value of Gts1p in the wild type cells during the transient DO oscillation (Fig. 6B). The fluctuation in the level of Gts1p(K17R) was severely restricted (Fig. 6C) compared with that of the wild type Gts1p expressed in either the wild type or gts1Δ cells transformed with GTS1 (9Wang J. Liu W. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) (Table II). In addition, the amplitude of the cell cycle oscillation also decreased. These results suggest that the N-degron of Gts1p is involved in the degradation of protein necessary for the fluctuation at the protein level and support the notion that periodic change in the Gts1p level is necessary for the persistent DO oscillation during the continuous culture.Table IIThe fluctuation in Gts1p level and oscillation in DO concentration in the wild type and gts1Δ transformed with the wild type and mutant Gts1psStrainsGts1p level (Peak/trough = amplitude)2-aRelative level of Gts1p to actin at the peak and trough of the fluctuations.

Open table in a new tab The UBA domain has been identified in various classes of proteins including those in the ubiquitin-proteasome system (12Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The function of the domain has not been elucidated, although it was reported that the UBA domains of Rad23p and Ddi1p, DNA-damage-inducible proteins, bind to ubiquitin noncovalently in the yeast two-hybrid system (18Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the UBA domain of Gts1p can associate with ubiquitin using the yeast two-hybrid system. When the monoubiquitin gene, which was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from UBI4 encoding five ubiquitin genes in tandem (15Finley D. Ozkaynak E. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1987; 48: 1035-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), was used as a bait in the system, Gts1p as prey did not bind to the protein (data not shown). However, when the whole UBI4 gene was used as bait, Gts1p did bind to the polyubiquitin protein, although the binding activity as determined using β-galactosidase was about half that of Gts1p proteins (14Kawabata K. Mitsui K. Uno T. Tamura K. Tsurugi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 259: 112-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) (TableIII). To further determine the binding activity of Gts1p to ubiquitin via the UBA domain, we introduced site-directed mutations in the amino acid triplet MGF between positions 205 and 207, since G-206 is the one of the most conserved residues among UBA sequences (12Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biol. Sci. 1996; 21: 172-173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). We constructed four mutant Gts1ps containing TGF, MAF, MGQ, and MAQ in place of MGF, named Gts1p(TGF), and so on. However, since gts1Δ expressing Gts1p(MAF) grew very slowly, it could not be used in further experiments. We do not know the reason why gts1Δ expressing Gts1p(MAQ), which contains another mutation at F-207, grew fairly well, but it should be pointed out that MAF is more hydrophobic than the wild type MGF, whereas MAQ retains some hydrophilicity similar to that of MGF. Of the three mutant Gts1ps tested, Gts1p(MAQ) was reduced most in terms of the activity to bind ubiquitin followed by that of Gts1p(TGF) (Table III). Since the binding activity of Gts1p(MGQ) to ubiquitin did not change as much as that of the wild type, Gly-206 is the most important residue for binding in the three mutant Gts1ps, which is consistent with the fact that Gly-206 is well conserved among UBA sequences. Thus, it is likely that the UBA domain of Gts1p can associate with ubiquitin, as shown in a previous report (18Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar).Table IIIInteraction between Gts1p and ubiquitin determined by the yeast two-hybrid assayPlasmidsβ-GalactosidaseBaitPreyActivity (n = 3)3-aThese are representative data of three independent experiments assayed in triplicate.Percentage of controlA420%pGAD4243-bVector alone.pGBT-GTS10.70 ± 0.086pGAD-GTS1pGBT-GTS111.4 ± 1.66100pGAD-UBI4pGBT-GTS15.14 ± 0.3545pGAD-UBI4pGBT-GTS1[TGF]3.72 ± 0.2333pGAD-UBI4pGBT-GTS1[MAQ]2.20 ± 0.1819pGAD-UBI4pGBT-GTS1[MGQ]4.78 ± 0.25423-a These are representative data of three independent experiments assayed in triplicate.3-b Vector alone. Open table in a new tab To examine whether the UBA domain is involved in the degradation of Gts1p itself, the protein levels of the mutant Gts1ps were measured (Fig. 7). Among the three mutant Gts1ps, the protein level of Gts1p(MAQ) was increased the most, followed by that of Gts1p(TGF) (Fig. 7). This was the reverse of the case for the binding activity for polyubiquitin (Table III), showing that the lower the binding activity for polyubiquitin, the lower the degradation capacity of the protein itself. When Gts1p(MAQ), whose activity to bind ubiquitin was most affected among the three, was expressed in gts1Δ in continuous culture, no oscillation in the concentration of DO was seen (Fig. 8). The Gts1p level was about twice the peak value in the wild type cells and seemed to gradually increase (Fig. 8 and Table II). On the other hand, gts1Δ cells expressing Gts1p(TGF) whose activity to bind ubiquitin is intermediate among the three showed a transient DO oscillation, which disappeared within a day (Fig. 9A and Table II). The Gts1p(TGF) level during this transient oscillation did not fluctuate and remained equivalent to the peak value of Gts1p (Fig.9B). In contrast, gts1Δ cells expressing Gts1p(TGQ) exhibited a metabolic oscillation with a high amplitude similar to that of the wild type cell (Table II). However, the oscillation did not last as long (∼3 days) (data not shown), probably because the amplitude of the Gts1p(TGF) level was significantly restricted, although the protein level was similar to that of the wild type cell (Table II). These results suggested that the UBA domain of Gts1p is involved in the degradation of the protein to regulate the fluctuation in the protein level, which is in turn required to maintain the oscillation of energy metabolism.Figure 9Effect of mutation in the UBA domain of Gts1p (Gts1p(TGF)) on the metabolic oscillation.A, the DO oscillation in gts1Δ cells expressing Gts1p(TGF) in continuous culture.

These are representative patterns of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report, we suggested that Gts1p was degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system through ubiquitination at K-17, although it is not clear whether the first methionine, one of the stabilizing residues according to the N-end rule (11Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12142-12149Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), is removed. In fact, we previously sequenced the N-terminal portion of Gts1p isolated from yeast overexpressing the protein under the control of theTPI promoter in a multicopy vector and found that this protein, if not all proteins, contained the first methionine. 3S. Yaguchi and K. Tsurugi, unpublished data. However, the result does not eliminate the possibility that the overexpressed Gts1p partly evades excision of the first methionine. The results of the present study showing that Gts1p had a half-life of 3.5 h in the wild type cells after cycloheximide treatment suggested that Gts1p has a destabilizing residue at the N terminus, taking into consideration that inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide generally promotes the stabilization of proteins and mRNAs. Furthermore, the K17R mutation resulted in an increase in the level of Gts1p and a longer half-life, suggesting ubiquitination at Lys-17. In addition, we detected a Gts1p-ubiquitin conjugate in cell lysate, although it was of a monoubiquitinated form. This result is in contrast to other reports (19Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar), where overexpressed Myc and x-ray-induced p53 formed multiubiquitin conjugates in a ladder-like fashion. Monoubiquitination has been reported to target membrane-bound proteins for endocytosis, leading to eventual degradation in vacuoles (21Terrell J. Shin S. Dunn R. Hicke L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 193-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 22Lucero P. Penalver E. Vela L. Lagunas R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that Gts1p is degraded in vacuoles, since the protein is located in the supernatant of the cell lysate and the degradation is inhibited by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. It is possible that the Gts1p associated with multiubiquitin chains undergoes rapid degradation. We showed that the UBA domain of Gts1p is involved in the interaction with ubiquitin using the two-hybrid assay and that the domain promoted the degradation of Gts1p itself. The result of the assay is consistent with the report by Bertolaet et al. (18Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) in which the UBA domains of Rad23p and Ddi1p bind ubiquitin noncovalently. The result showing that Gts1p did not bind to the ubiquitin monomer in the two-hybrid system is in close agreement with a recent report (23Wilkinson C.R.M. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M. Semple C. Gordon C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) that indicates that UBA domain-containing proteins like Rad23 and Mud1 bind more than 300 times more tightly to polyubiquitin than to monoubiquitin. The binding of the polyubiquitin of the three mutant Gts1ps at the UBA domain in vitro decreased in parallel with the capacity for degradation of Gts1p in vivo. Gts1p(MAQ) containing a Gly to Ala substitution at position 206, which most affected the association with polyubiquitin, was most deficient in the degradation of Gts1p. The Gly residue is one of the most conserved in the UBA domain and is located in the loop linking α-helices 1 and 2 and is known to comprise a part of the hydrophobic surface to which the ubiquitin molecule is thought to bind (18Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 417-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 24Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.F. Chen I.S.Y. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The result suggested that the UBA domain is involved in the degradation of multiubiquitinated Gts1p in an autoregulated (autocatalytic) manner, since the expression of Gts1p(MAQ) which contains an intact N-degron resulted in the complete loss of the fluctuation of Gts1p level in the continuous culture. This may be a reason why multiubiquitinated Gts1p was not detected in cell lysate by Western blotting. However, since this domain is contained in many proteins without N-degron and reportedly interacts with proteins other than ubiquitin (24Dieckmann T. Withers-Ward E.S. Jarosinski M.A. Liu C.F. Chen I.S.Y. Feigon J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1042-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the possibility remains that it has as yet unknown functions in addition to the degradation of Gts1p itself. In this report, we presented evidence that the degradation of Gts1p by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is necessary for a rhythmic expression of the protein. It now remains to be elucidated when and how the ubiquitination system is activated during metabolic oscillation in a continuous culture. Since the ubiquitin-proteasome system requires a large amount of ATP, it is assumed that the system is activated in the respiratory phase when much more ATP is produced in mitochondria than in the respiro-fermentative phase when glycolysis is predominant. Consistently, the decrease of Gts1p begins in the middle of the respiratory phase (9Wang J. Liu W. Mitsui K. Tsurugi K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Tonozuka H. Wang J. Mitsui K. Saito T. Hamada Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, since the expression ofGTS1 is regulated in an oscillatory manner at the transcription level (10Tonozuka H. Wang J. Mitsui K. Saito T. Hamada Y. Tsurugi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the regulation at the rhythmic expression of Gts1p may be much more complicated than anticipated here. It would be interesting to note that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the regulation of biological rhythm in higher organisms. The three clock-related PAS proteins from Arabidopsiscontain the F-box characteristic of proteins that direct ubiquitin-mediated degradation (25Somers D.E. Schultz T.F. Milnamow M. Kay S.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 26Nelson D.C. Lasswell J. Rogg L.E. Cohen M.A. Bartel B. Cell. 2000; 101: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), and in Drosophila a clock-related protein called timeless (TIM) is known to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in response to light (27Naidoo N. Song W. Hunter-Ensor M. Sehgal A. Science. 1999; 285: 1737-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). These and our results suggested the involvement of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the regulation of biological rhythms. In this report, we showed, for the first time, that the ubiquitin-proteasome system is involved in the regulation of the ultradian oscillation of the energy metabolism by means of degrading Gts1p in yeast. These results are very important and suggest for further study on the molecular mechanism of how ultradian rhythms in yeast are regulated. Furthermore, since the energy metabolism pathway has been proven to be an autogenous oscillator in dissipative structures including all living organisms, these data will contribute to studies on the biological rhythms in other organisms."
