One to two days following engagement of T-cell receptors to trigger both PKC- and Ca2+-dependent events, IKCa1expression increased from an average of 8 to 300–800 channels/cell. Selective stimulation of the PKC pathway resulted in equivalent up-regulation, whereas a calcium ionophore was relatively ineffective. Enhancement in IKCa1 mRNA levels paralleled the increased channel number. The genomic organization ofIKCa1, SKCa2, and SKCa3 were defined, and IKCa and SKCa genes were found to have a remarkably similar intron-exon structure. Mitogens enhancedIKCa1 promoter activity proportional to the increase inIKCa1 mRNA, suggesting that transcriptional mechanisms underlie channel up-regulation. Mutation of motifs for AP1 and Ikaros-2 in the promoter abolished this induction. Selective Kv1.3inhibitors ShK-Dap22, margatoxin, and correolide suppressed mitogenesis of resting T-cells but not preactivated T-cells with up-regulated IKCa1 channel expression. Selectively blockingIKCa1 channels with clotrimazole or TRAM-34 suppressed mitogenesis of preactivated lymphocytes, whereas resting T-cells were less sensitive. Thus, Kv1.3 channels are essential for activation of quiescent cells, but signaling through the PKC pathway enhances expression of IKCa1 channels that are required for continued proliferation.

Stimulation of either of these pathways is capable of triggering different gene transcription events, and both are required for complete lymphocyte activation. A recent gene-chip survey of T-cells stimulated with a variety of mitogens, detected the induction of hundreds of genes (1Alizadeh A.A. Staudt L.M. Curr. Opin.

The rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) activates calcineurin, a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the cytoplasmic transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells), enabling it to translocate to the nucleus and bind to NFAT-response elements of several genes, including the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) (2Clipstone N.A.

The immunosuppressive drug, cyclosporin A (CsA), blocks this pathway by interacting with calcineurin and thereby suppresses activation (3Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P.

In a separate pathway, activation of PKC leads to phosphorylation of numerous substrates and results in assembly of Fos/Jun heterodimers that bind to activation protein-1 (AP1) elements on an overlapping set of genes via activation of the Ras and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) pathways. The functional significance of PKCτ, in particular, has been recently demonstrated (5Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A.

For example, the JNK pathway is co-activated by increases in cytoplasmic calcium (7Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y.

Sustained [Ca2+]isignaling, mediated by calcium entry through calcium release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels, and PKC activation are both essential for complete activation.Two potassium channels, the voltage-gated K+ channelKv1.3 and the calcium-activated K+ channelIKCa1 (also known as KCNN4, IK1,hKCa4, and hSK4) (8Ishii T.M.

Freshly isolated resting human T-cells functionally express on average ∼300 Kv1.3channels (11Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin.

Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). During activation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), expression ofIKCa1 channels is strongly enhanced, while levels ofKv1.3 exhibit a modest enhancement (13Deutsch C. Krause D. Lee S.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1986; 372: 405-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Changes in expression levels of K+ channels during activation have also been noted in murine T-cells (15DeCoursey T.E. Chandy K.G. Gupta S. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 89: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and in human and murine B cells (16Partiseti M. Choquet D. Diu A. Korn H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3361-3368PubMed Google Scholar, 17Partiseti M. Korn H. Choquet D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2462-2470PubMed Google Scholar). A recent gene chip survey (1Alizadeh A.A. Staudt L.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) revealed a reduction inKv1.3 mRNA levels in activated compared to resting T-cells, suggesting that post-transcriptional mechanisms contribute to the up-regulation of this channel.In this study, we define the pathway leading to IKCa1up-regulation using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to trigger PKC selectively or ionomycin to stimulate the calcium-dependent cascade, and other mitogens (anti-CD3 Ab or PHA) that stimulate both pathways. By combining electrophysiological and molecular methods we show that stimulation of the PKC pathway alone is sufficient to enhanceIKCa1 channel expression via transcriptional activation of the IKCa1 promoter. A reporter gene assay combined with mutational analysis defined the minimally active promoter region of theIKCa1 gene, demonstrating the importance of AP1, the PKC-dependent site of binding by Fos/Jun heterodimers. Using selective Kv1.3 and IKCa1 inhibitors we demonstrate an important functional role of Kv1.3 channels in resting T-cells and IKCa1 channels in activated T-cells.DISCUSSIONTo investigate the molecular mechanism of IKCa1 channel up-regulation in T lymphocytes, we determined the genomic organizations of IKCa1, SKCa2, and SKCa3, and functionally mapped the promoter of IKCa1. The striking similarity in intron-exon boundaries suggests a common evolutionary origin of IKCa1 and SKCa1–3 genes.IKCa1 functional expression is enhanced by treatment with PHA, anti-CD3 Ab, PMA, or PMA + ionomycin (Fig. 3). This increase is in direct proportion to the increase in IKCa1 transcripts (Fig.5) and to the enhanced activity of the IKCa1 promoter. The PMA-triggered IKCa1 up-regulation is an early event in the T-cell activation cascade. Enhanced IKCa1 promoter activity is detected as early as 3 h after activation (Fig. 10), and augmented channel expression is observed prior to increase in cell size, onset of DNA synthesis, or cytokine production (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, transcriptional mechanisms are likely to underlie the increasedIKCa1 expression in activated lymphocytes, although post-transcriptional mechanisms (including increased channel trafficking) may also contribute. Within the promoter region of theIKCa1 gene, several potential transcription factor-binding sites were identified and functionally probed by deletion and mutational analysis. Mutagenesis and gel-shift studies suggest that the AP1 and Ik-2 transcription factors, but not NFAT, are required for basal transcription of the IKCa1 gene and mediate the transcriptional augmentation of IKCa1 expression during the T-cell activation response. These results may be relevant to B lymphocytes (16Partiseti M. Choquet D. Diu A. Korn H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3361-3368PubMed Google Scholar) and T-cell subsets (43Fanger C.M. Neben A.L. Cahalan M.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in which levels ofIKCa1 channels are up-regulated during mitogenesis. Recent studies have reported Ras-induced up-regulation ofIKCa1 in fibroblasts (44Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Pena T.L. Rane S.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which may be mediated via the AP1-dependent pathway described below in human T lymphocytes (Fig. 13).Fig. 13 summarizes the signaling pathways that likely contribute toIKCa1 up-regulation in T lymphocytes. Anti-CD3 Ab or PMA augment IKCa1 transcription in an AP1-dependent manner via stimulation of the PKC and downstream Ras and JNK pathways. The resulting AP1 (c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer) complex binds to the IKCa1 promoter (as shown in Fig. 11) and initiates transcription of the IKCa1 message in conjunction with the transcription factor, Ik-2. Ik-2 is a nuclear factor that sets a threshold for T-cell mitogenesis; in activated T-cells, Ik-2 co-localizes with the DNA replication machinery and modulates cell entry into the S-phase (46Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Increased IKCa1 mRNA levels lead to enhanced expression of functional IKCa1 channels on the cell membrane tightly complexed to calmodulin, which serves as the calcium sensor for these channels (22Fanger C.M. Ghanshani S. Logsdon N.J. Rauer H. Kalman K. Zhou J. Beckingham K. Chandy K.G. Cahalan M.D. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5746-5754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calmodulin expression is also augmented during human T-cell activation, especially the CAM-III mRNA and protein (47Colomer J. Agell N. Engel P. Alberola-Ila J. Bachs O. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CsA partially suppresses the mitogen-stimulated increase in IKCa1 expression (Fig. 3), but this is not due to inhibition of the IKCa1 promoter, and may instead result from blockade of a post-transcriptional step. Ionomycin by itself fails to increase IKCa1 expression significantly, most likely due to its inability to stimulate AP1 production, whereas its enhancement of PMA-induced up-regulation ofIKCa1 (Figs. 2, 3, and 12) may be due to co-activation of the JNK pathway via an increase in cytoplasmic calcium (Fig. 13). The up-regulation of IKCa1 channels during human T-cell activation parallels the recently described ∼10-fold increase in numbers of the CRAC channels induced by PHA and PMA, but not ionomycin (48Fomina A.F. Fauger C.M. Kozak J.A. Cahalan M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these two channels involved in calcium signaling could be coordinately regulated.Calcium-entry through CRAC channels is promoted by membrane hyperpolarization due to the opening of IKCa1 andKv1.3 channels (11Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since quiescent human T lymphocytes contain on average roughly ∼300–400 Kv1.3 channels/cell and only ∼8 IKCa1 channels, the membrane potential of quiescent cells is thought to be mainly dependent on the voltage-gated channel with the IKCa1 channels playing a minimal role (11Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In keeping with this idea, blockade of Kv1.3 by specific and potent inhibitors attenuates the calcium signaling response and suppresses the activation response of resting human T-cells bothin vitro and in vivo (25Kalman K.

In contrast, clotrimazole and TRAM-34, both potentIKCa1 inhibitors, suppress the activation of resting human T-cells (Fig. 12, B and C) (18Wulff H. Miller M.J. Hänsel W. Grissmer S.

T-cells stimulated for 48–72 h with mitogens have 300–800 IKCa1 channels along with 400–500Kv1.3 channels (Figs. 2 and 3) (13Deutsch C. Krause D. Lee S.C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1986; 372: 405-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 601-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Khanna and colleagues (26Khanna R. Chang M.C. Joiner W.J. Kaczmarek L.K. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14838-14849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), reported that PHA-induced proliferation of PHA preactivated T-cells was potently suppressed by clotrimazole tested at a single dose of 250 nm. We have extended these studies by using a complete range of concentrations of clotrimazole and TRAM-34 and showing that these inhibitors potently suppress reactivation of anti-CD3 Ab- or PMA preactivated lymphocytes at submicromolar concentrations consistent with their channel-blocking dose (Fig. 12,B and D (18)). Our results taken together with earlier studies (10Logsdon N.J. Kang J. Togo J.A. Christian E.P. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32723-32726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen.

The parallel enhancement of IKCa1 and CRAC channels might allow the activated T-cell to fine-tune its regulation of membrane potential in response to subtle changes in cytoplasmic calcium, which in turn would modulate calcium entry. Consistent with this notion, previous studies on activated T-cells have shown coupling between IKCa channels and membrane potential (49Verheugen J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Oortgiesen M. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 765-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 50Verheugen J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More recently, we have found that the IKCa1 peptide inhibitor, ChTX-Glu32 (23Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1201-1208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), suppresses thapsigargin-induced calcium entry into activated human T-cells (51Rauer H. Fanger C. Neben A. Pennigton P.W. Chandy K.G. Cahalan M.D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 73AGoogle Scholar). Thus, the concerted action of the two potassium channels regulates the entry of calcium through CRAC channels in quiescent and activated T-cells and thereby modulates the immune response. Lymphocyte activation involves two key intracellular signaling pathways, the calcium-signaling cascade and protein kinase C (PKC)1-dependent events. Stimulation of either of these pathways is capable of triggering different gene transcription events, and both are required for complete lymphocyte activation. A recent gene-chip survey of T-cells stimulated with a variety of mitogens, detected the induction of hundreds of genes (1Alizadeh A.A. Staudt L.M. Curr. Opin.

In this study, we define the pathway leading to IKCa1up-regulation using phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to trigger PKC selectively or ionomycin to stimulate the calcium-dependent cascade, and other mitogens (anti-CD3 Ab or PHA) that stimulate both pathways. By combining electrophysiological and molecular methods we show that stimulation of the PKC pathway alone is sufficient to enhanceIKCa1 channel expression via transcriptional activation of the IKCa1 promoter. A reporter gene assay combined with mutational analysis defined the minimally active promoter region of theIKCa1 gene, demonstrating the importance of AP1, the PKC-dependent site of binding by Fos/Jun heterodimers. Using selective Kv1.3 and IKCa1 inhibitors we demonstrate an important functional role of Kv1.3 channels in resting T-cells and IKCa1 channels in activated T-cells. DISCUSSIONTo investigate the molecular mechanism of IKCa1 channel up-regulation in T lymphocytes, we determined the genomic organizations of IKCa1, SKCa2, and SKCa3, and functionally mapped the promoter of IKCa1. The striking similarity in intron-exon boundaries suggests a common evolutionary origin of IKCa1 and SKCa1–3 genes.IKCa1 functional expression is enhanced by treatment with PHA, anti-CD3 Ab, PMA, or PMA + ionomycin (Fig. 3). This increase is in direct proportion to the increase in IKCa1 transcripts (Fig.5) and to the enhanced activity of the IKCa1 promoter. The PMA-triggered IKCa1 up-regulation is an early event in the T-cell activation cascade. Enhanced IKCa1 promoter activity is detected as early as 3 h after activation (Fig. 10), and augmented channel expression is observed prior to increase in cell size, onset of DNA synthesis, or cytokine production (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, transcriptional mechanisms are likely to underlie the increasedIKCa1 expression in activated lymphocytes, although post-transcriptional mechanisms (including increased channel trafficking) may also contribute. Within the promoter region of theIKCa1 gene, several potential transcription factor-binding sites were identified and functionally probed by deletion and mutational analysis. Mutagenesis and gel-shift studies suggest that the AP1 and Ik-2 transcription factors, but not NFAT, are required for basal transcription of the IKCa1 gene and mediate the transcriptional augmentation of IKCa1 expression during the T-cell activation response. These results may be relevant to B lymphocytes (16Partiseti M. Choquet D. Diu A. Korn H. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3361-3368PubMed Google Scholar) and T-cell subsets (43Fanger C.M. Neben A.L. Cahalan M.D. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1153-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in which levels ofIKCa1 channels are up-regulated during mitogenesis. Recent studies have reported Ras-induced up-regulation ofIKCa1 in fibroblasts (44Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Pena T.L. Rane S.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which may be mediated via the AP1-dependent pathway described below in human T lymphocytes (Fig. 13).Fig. 13 summarizes the signaling pathways that likely contribute toIKCa1 up-regulation in T lymphocytes. Anti-CD3 Ab or PMA augment IKCa1 transcription in an AP1-dependent manner via stimulation of the PKC and downstream Ras and JNK pathways. The resulting AP1 (c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer) complex binds to the IKCa1 promoter (as shown in Fig. 11) and initiates transcription of the IKCa1 message in conjunction with the transcription factor, Ik-2. Ik-2 is a nuclear factor that sets a threshold for T-cell mitogenesis; in activated T-cells, Ik-2 co-localizes with the DNA replication machinery and modulates cell entry into the S-phase (46Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Increased IKCa1 mRNA levels lead to enhanced expression of functional IKCa1 channels on the cell membrane tightly complexed to calmodulin, which serves as the calcium sensor for these channels (22Fanger C.M. Ghanshani S. Logsdon N.J. Rauer H. Kalman K. Zhou J. Beckingham K. Chandy K.G. Cahalan M.D. Aiyar J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5746-5754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Interestingly, calmodulin expression is also augmented during human T-cell activation, especially the CAM-III mRNA and protein (47Colomer J. Agell N. Engel P. Alberola-Ila J. Bachs O. Cell Calcium. 1993; 14: 609-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CsA partially suppresses the mitogen-stimulated increase in IKCa1 expression (Fig. 3), but this is not due to inhibition of the IKCa1 promoter, and may instead result from blockade of a post-transcriptional step. Ionomycin by itself fails to increase IKCa1 expression significantly, most likely due to its inability to stimulate AP1 production, whereas its enhancement of PMA-induced up-regulation ofIKCa1 (Figs. 2, 3, and 12) may be due to co-activation of the JNK pathway via an increase in cytoplasmic calcium (Fig. 13). The up-regulation of IKCa1 channels during human T-cell activation parallels the recently described ∼10-fold increase in numbers of the CRAC channels induced by PHA and PMA, but not ionomycin (48Fomina A.F. Fauger C.M. Kozak J.A. Cahalan M.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that these two channels involved in calcium signaling could be coordinately regulated.Calcium-entry through CRAC channels is promoted by membrane hyperpolarization due to the opening of IKCa1 andKv1.3 channels (11Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Since quiescent human T lymphocytes contain on average roughly ∼300–400 Kv1.3 channels/cell and only ∼8 IKCa1 channels, the membrane potential of quiescent cells is thought to be mainly dependent on the voltage-gated channel with the IKCa1 channels playing a minimal role (11Cahalan M.D. Chandy K.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In keeping with this idea, blockade of Kv1.3 by specific and potent inhibitors attenuates the calcium signaling response and suppresses the activation response of resting human T-cells bothin vitro and in vivo (25Kalman K.

We have extended these studies by using a complete range of concentrations of clotrimazole and TRAM-34 and showing that these inhibitors potently suppress reactivation of anti-CD3 Ab- or PMA preactivated lymphocytes at submicromolar concentrations consistent with their channel-blocking dose (Fig. 12,B and D (18)). Our results taken together with earlier studies (10Logsdon N.J. Kang J. Togo J.A. Christian E.P. Aiyar J. J. Biol.

The parallel enhancement of IKCa1 and CRAC channels might allow the activated T-cell to fine-tune its regulation of membrane potential in response to subtle changes in cytoplasmic calcium, which in turn would modulate calcium entry. Consistent with this notion, previous studies on activated T-cells have shown coupling between IKCa channels and membrane potential (49Verheugen J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Oortgiesen M. Cahalan M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 765-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 50Verheugen J.A. Vijverberg H.P. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). More recently, we have found that the IKCa1 peptide inhibitor, ChTX-Glu32 (23Rauer H. Lanigan M.D. Pennington M.W. Aiyar J. Ghanshani S. Cahalan M.D. Norton R.S. Chandy K.G. J. Biol.

Neben A. Pennigton P.W. Chandy K.G. Cahalan M.D. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 73AGoogle Scholar). Thus, the concerted action of the two potassium channels regulates the entry of calcium through CRAC channels in quiescent and activated T-cells and thereby modulates the immune response. To investigate the molecular mechanism of IKCa1 channel up-regulation in T lymphocytes, we determined the genomic organizations of IKCa1, SKCa2, and SKCa3, and functionally mapped the promoter of IKCa1.

Recent studies have reported Ras-induced up-regulation ofIKCa1 in fibroblasts (44Huang Y. Rane S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Pena T.L.

CsA partially suppresses the mitogen-stimulated increase in IKCa1 expression (Fig. 3), but this is not due to inhibition of the IKCa1 promoter, and may instead result from blockade of a post-transcriptional step. Ionomycin by itself fails to increase IKCa1 expression significantly, most likely due to its inability to stimulate AP1 production, whereas its enhancement of PMA-induced up-regulation ofIKCa1 (Figs. 2, 3, and 12) may be due to co-activation of the JNK pathway via an increase in cytoplasmic calcium (Fig. 13).

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Alternate outcomes for ubiquitinated proteins are activation or transport via an intracellular membrane vesicular system (2Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It has now become apparent that several other “ubiquitin-like” tagging molecules exist that are conjugated using enzymatic systems similar but nonidentical to those used by ubiquitin (3Hochstrasser M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 901-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Saitoh H. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Two groups initially determined the nature of a modification of the Ran GTPase-activating protein (RanGAP1) involved in the interaction of this protein with RanBP2/Nup358 at the nuclear pore complex (5Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 6Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). They called the modifying molecule GMP1 (GAP-modifying protein1) or SUMO-1 (small ubiquitin-likemodifier 1). SUMO-1 has since been identified several times as an interacting partner in the yeast two-hybrid system and given different names: with the promyelocytic leukemia gene product (PML) (PIC-1) (7Brody M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar), with the death domain of the FAS antigen or TNF-receptor (sentrin, DAP-1) (8Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar, 9Liou M.-L. Liou H.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10145-10153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and with the RAD51 and RAD52 proteins involved in DNA recombination and repair (UBL-1) (10Shen Z. Pardington-Purtymun P.E. Comeaux J.C. Moyzis R.K. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1996; 37: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A budding yeast homologue of SUMO-1 (Smt3p) was identified by Meluh and Koshland (11Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3401-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) as a suppressor of mutations in Mif2 (mitotic instability factor2), a protein thought to be the yeast equivalent of the CENP-C mammalian centromere protein. One putative role for SUMO-1/Smt3p is thus in assembly or maintenance of the centromere/kinetochore structure involved in chromosome segregation. Similarly, the fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) equivalent of Smt3p, Pmt3p, has recently been shown to be involved in chromosomal segregation and the control of telomere length (12Tanaka K. Nishide J. Okazaki K. Kato H. Niwa O. Nakagawa T. Matsuda H. Kawamukai M. Murakami Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8660-8672Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Enzymes involved in Smt3p/SUMO-1 conjugation have been identified in yeast and mammalian cells (13Desterro J.M. P Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 14Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The SUMO-1-activating enzyme (E1) consists of a heterodimer of the Aos1p/SAE1 and Uba2p/SAE2 proteins that together reconstitute the equivalent of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme Uba1 (13Desterro J.M. P Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme (E2) in yeast, mammalian cells, and Xenopus is Ubc9 (14Johnson E.S. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). So far no E3 enzymes have been identified. Ubc9, originally thought to be a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, was shown to be essential gene in yeast (16Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) because temperature-sensitive mutants of Ubc9 arrested in mitosis, as did mutants of a SUMO-1-cleaving protease Ulp1 (17Li S.-J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). In yeast and mammalian cells, there is very little free Smt3p/SUMO-1. Most (>90%) of the SUMO-1 detected on Western analysis of extracts from mammalian cells is conjugated to the RanGAP1 nuclear pore protein (18Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Other proteins subject to modification by SUMO-1 are the PML and Sp100 proteins, which form part of the nuclear structures known as PODs (PML oncogenic domains) or nd10s (19Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 362-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For PML, it has been shown that SUMO-1 modification is essential for its localization in PODs, with free PML being found in the nucleoplasm. Another substrate for SUMO-1 is Iκβα (20Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of NFκβ, which is modified by SUMO-1 on the lysine residue also modified by ubiquitin. SUMO-1 modification prevents ubiquitination and thus results in stabilization of Iκβα and consequently in inhibition of NF-κβ (20Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). In the present communication, we describe SUMO-1 modification of the p53-related p73α protein. p53 is the most widely studied tumor suppressor and is mutated in over 50% of human tumors (21May P. May E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7621-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). It plays a key role in both the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints and the initiation of apoptotic cell death in response to DNA damage. The activity of p53 has been shown to be finely tuned by a variety of post-translational modifications (phosphorylation, acetylation, and glycosylation) and to be highly sensitive to conformational changes (22Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The p53 molecule contains a number of well defined domains including an N-terminal transcriptional activation domain and a central core, corresponding to the DNA-binding domain, which is highly conserved in evolution and which contains the majority of the mutation hot spots in cancer cells. The rest of the molecule contains a linker region including the major nuclearization signal, an oligomerization domain, and a regulatory C-terminal region containing multiple phosphorylation and acetylation sites (21May P. May E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7621-7636Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 22Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Recently, this region has been shown to contain a lysine residue (386) that can be covalently modified by SUMO-1 (23Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M.P. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 24Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwartz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). We previously reported the existence of a p53-related gene, p73, mapping to a chromosomal locus (1p36.3) often deleted in neuroectodermal human cancers such as neuroblastomas (24Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwartz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Subsequent work from several laboratories has described the existence of another p53 family member, more closely related to p73 than to p53, variously described as p63, KET, and p51 (25Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). p73 shows structural similarities with p53, including the presence of transcription-activating, DNA-binding, and oligomerization domains. It exists as multiple isoforms, resulting from differential splicing of C-terminal exons, of which the two major forms are the α and β isoforms containing 636 and 499 amino acids (25Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar, 26Kaelin W.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7701-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). p73 differs from p53 in that its levels of expression are not elevated in response to environmental stresses such as UV irradiation and actinomycin D treatment (25Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). However, in interaction with the protein kinase c-Abl it mediates an apoptotic response to ionizing radiation and to genotoxic agents such as cisplatin (27White E. Prives C. Nature. 1999; 399: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast to p53, no functionally significant p73 mutations have so far been reported in cancer cells, but a monoallelic pattern of expression is sometimes observed (26Kaelin W.G. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7701-7705Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Analysis of p73 knock-out mice does not show an increased susceptibility to spontaneous tumorigenesis (28Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J . Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). However, these studies reveal that p73 plays key roles in a number of developmental processes that are nonoverlapping with the roles played by other p53 family members (28Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J . Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). The activities of p73 may be exerted at multiple levels. Firstly, p73 is a transcriptional activator eliciting a response different from that obtained with p53 (29Yu J. Zhang L. Hwang P.M. Rago C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14517-14522Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Secondly, the major form of p73 is often an N-terminally truncated form that would be incapable of transcriptional activation (28Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J . Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D. Nature. 2000; 404: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of other nontranscriptional roles for p73. During yeast two-hybrid screens using p73 as a bait, we isolated the cDNA for SUMO-1. Here we show that p73 can be covalently modified by SUMO-1, with the major modification occurring on the terminal lysine residue. A number of other SUMO-1-interacting proteins were isolated in the p73 two-hybrid screening, and we have been able to deduce and confirm a novel SUMO-1 interaction motif. The nature of the proteins identified here suggests that one role for SUMO-1 may be in transcriptional regulation, perhaps co-ordinating this with other key cellular processes such as cell cycle checkpoints, chromosome segregation, DNA recombination and repair, and the induction of apoptosis. The SK-N-AS neuroblastoma cell line (30Sugimoto T. Tatsumi E. Kemshead T. Helson L. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1984; 73: 51-57PubMed Google Scholar) and the 293 embryonic kidney cell line (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1573) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 10% fetal calf serum. The U937 monocytic cell line (American Type Culture Collection CRL 1593) was grown in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Total cellular RNA was extracted from SK-N-AS and U937 cells by the guaninidium thiocyanate/acid phenol method (31Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Poly(A)+RNAs were isolated using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (Dynal). 1 μg of each poly(A)+ RNA was transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase (Superscript, Life Technologies, Inc.) and the primer GATCCGGGCCCATTTTCTAC[ACGT][ACGT][ACGT][ACGT][ACGT][ACGT]. cDNAs were fractionated on Sephacryl S400 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and fractions containing cDNA of approximately 500–1500 nucleotides were selected for cloning in the pJGC cloning vector, derived from the pJG4-5 activation domain vector (32Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) by insertion of a polylinker containing ApaI and BamHI cloning sites between the EcoRI and HindIII sites. cDNA libraries were constructed by the primer adapter method (33Caput D. Beutler B. Hartog K. Thayer R. Brown-Shimer S. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1670-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar). Sequences corresponding to p73α (amino acids 85–636), p73β (amino acids 85–499), and p53 (amino acids 73–393) were inserted in the pEG202 vector between either the EcoRI or BamHI sites and the XhoI site (32Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar) creating fusion proteins with the LexA DNA-binding domain. The pEG202.p73α bait was introduced using lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol transformation with sheared single-stranded DNA carrier (34Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar) into the EGY48 strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (containing the LEU2 gene under the control of six LexA operators) along with a reporter plasmid pSH18-34 containing the LacZ gene under the control of eight LexA operators. cDNA libraries were then similarly introduced, and yeast colonies were selected on Yeast Nitrogen Base (Difco) medium containing 2% glucose and leucine (but lacking tryptophan, histidine, and uracil). Approximately 106transformed yeast were obtained with the U937 library and 2 × 106 transformed yeast with the SK-N-AS library. After 3–4 days, colonies were replicated to nitrocelulose filters (Protran BA85; Schleicher & Schull), replated on dishes containing 2% galactose, 1% raffinose, 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) (Life Technologies, Inc.) lacking leucine, and grown for 4–5 days. 20 yeast colonies from each cDNA library transformation showing a blue coloration were selected for further study. Plasmid DNA was extracted using a glass bead disruption method (35Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2057) Google Scholar), and cDNA inserts in the pJGC plasmid were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides flanking the cDNA insert and sequenced. The pJGC plasmid was isolated by selection in the KC8 bacterium in minimal A medium containing vitamin B1 and supplemented with uracil, histidine, and leucine but lacking tryptophan. It was then tested for interaction with the p73α, p73β, and p53 pEG202 bait plasmids by measurements of the β-galactosidase levels in transformed EGY48 24 h after galactose induction of the GAL1 promoter in pJGC, as described by Kippert (36Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions were performed by limited polymerase chain reaction amplification of plasmid DNA using Pfu DNA polymerase and oligonucleotides containing the mutated codons, followed by digestion of remaining input plasmid DNA using the methylation sensitive enzyme Dpn1 (QuikChange; Stratagene). The p73α, p73β, p53, and SUMO-1 cDNAs were introduced into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) or an epitope-tagged vector derived from pcDNA3 by insertion of an optimalized ATG codon (CCACCATGGCG) and a c-Myc 9E10 epitope (EQKLISEEDL) between the HindIII andEcoRI sites. Plasmid DNA preparations were performed using the QIAfilter Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen). Approximately 106cells were transfected in six-well dishes using 1–2 μg of plasmid DNA and LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were scraped from the dish 20–30 h after transfection, resuspended in denaturing SDS gel buffer (Bio-Rad) with 0.7 m β−mercaptoethanol and analyzed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C-extra; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). These were analyzed with the following primary antibodies: anti-c-Myc (9E10) (Santa Cruz or Invitrogen), anti-GMP1 (anti-SUMO-1) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-p73α (a rabbit polyclonal antibody: (25Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

The anti-p73 antibody was generated against a C-terminal p73α () glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (25Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.-C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.-M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1539) Google Scholar). p73 forms were quantified by scanning of different film exposures and analysis using BioImage (Kodak) software. SK-N-AS cells were transfected in six-well dishes as described above using the RGC firefly luciferase reporter gene (200 ng) and a pRL-CMV Renilla luciferase control (100 ng) (Promega). 20 h after transfection, cells were scraped in 250 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) and subjected to two cycles of freeze-thawing. 20 μl of cell extract were analyzed with the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system, using a Lumistar luminometer. Luciferase activities of the RGC-luciferase vector were normalized based on the luciferase activities of the co-transfected pRL-CMV, to correct for variations in cell number and/or transfection efficiency between wells. While performing two-hybrid screens using a p73α protein sequence fused to the LexA DNA binding domain (32Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), we isolated cDNAs encoding SUMO-1, Ubc9 (the SUMO-1-conjugating enzyme), and a SUMO-1-activating enzyme SAE2 (15Desterro J.M.P. Thomson J. Hay R.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Both SUMO-1 and Ubc-9 were found to interact with p73α and p53 but not with p73β (Fig. 1 A). Surprisingly, most of the other proteins isolated in the p73α two-hybrid screen also showed interaction with p73α and p53 but not with p73β (Fig. 1 B). These proteins include PIASx (37Liu B. Liao J. Rao X. Kushner S.A. Chung C.D. Chang D.D. Shuai K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10626-10631Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), PKY (38Begley D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Sampson K.E.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12767-12774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This suggested that these proteins may have been isolated via interaction with p73 modified by the yeast SUMO-1 equivalent (Smt3p), because higher molecular mass forms of p73 are detected in these yeast (not shown). Indeed, when tested directly with a SUMO-1 bait, all of these proteins gave a positive result (Fig. 1 B). When the cDNA sequences of the SUMO-1-interacting proteins were examined for the presence of common sequences, an 11-amino acid motif was detected in a subset of the proteins. This contained a central serine doublet separated by one amino acid (SXS), within which one serine was replaced by threonine in the human PKY cDNA (Fig.2 A). This SXS triplet is flanked on the N-terminal side by predominantly hydrophobic amino acids and on the C-terminal side by acidic amino acids (D/E) (Fig. 2 A). This motif is evolutionarily conserved in the PKY and PIAS gene families (Fig. 2 A). In view of the subsequent mutagenesis experiments (see below), it is unclear whether the motif in SAE2 that served to derive this consensus would in fact be sufficient on its own to interact with SUMO-1.Figure 1Interaction of p73α, p73β, p53, and SUMO-1 with proteins encoded by cDNAs isolated in the p73α two-hybrid screen. A, Ubc9 (U45328; amino acids 1–143), SUMO-1 (U61937; amino acids 4–101), and p73β (amino acids 85–499) in the pJGC vector were transformed in the yeast EGY48 along with pSH18-34 and different pEG202 bait proteins (p53, p73α, p73β, and SUMO-1). Interactions were measured by β-galactosidase levels (36Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol.

The enzyme was initially isolated from human breast cancer cells and has been implicated in breast cancer invasion and metastasis. In the current study, using active matriptase isolated from human milk, we demonstrate that matriptase is able to cleave various synthetic substrates with arginine or lysine as their P1 sites and prefers small side chain amino acids, such as Ala and Gly, at P2 sites.

A search for epithelial-derived proteases, which may interact both with stromal-derived ECM-degrading protease systems and with motility factors, could provide a missing link in our understanding of tissue remodeling and cancer invasion and metastasis. To investigate the epithelial role in tissue remodeling and in many aspects of tumor behavior, including growth and metastasis, we have carried out our studies on an epithelial-derived, integral membrane, trypsin-like, serine protease (matriptase) and its cognate, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor (hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1, HAI-1) (4Shi Y.E.

Matriptase is a type 2, integral membrane, trypsin-like serine protease with two putative regulatory modules: two tandem repeats of a CUB (C1r/s, Uegf, andBone morphogenetic protein-1) domain and four tandem repeats of a low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor domain (also see updated sequence in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank with accession numberAF118224). Matriptase was independently cloned by others, and termed membrane-type serine protease 1 (MT-SP1) (8Takeuchi T. Shuman M.A. Craik C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11054-11061Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The mouse homologue of matriptase was also cloned and termed epithin (9Kim M.G. Chen C. Lyu M.S. Cho E.G. Park D. Kozak C. Schwartz R.H. Immunogenetics. 1999; 49: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The cognate inhibitor of matriptase is a type 1 integral membrane protein, containing two Kunitz domains, separated by an LDL receptor domain (7Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. J. Biol.

The inhibitor was independently characterized by others as an inhibitor (HAI-1) of hepatocyte growth factor activator, an enzyme identified in serum (10Shimomura T. Denda K. Kitamura A. Kawaguchi T.

Considering that matriptase exhibits trypsin-like activity and presents on the surfaces of epithelial cells, and that activation of the uPA system and HGF/SF requires cleavage at Arg or Lys, we hypothesize that matriptase could act as an upstream, epithelial membrane activator of the downstream, stromal-derived effectors of tissue remodeling. In the current study, we set out to investigate the potential collaboration between epithelial and stromal cells by examining if matriptase is able to activate HGF/SF and the protease components of the uPA system. Using the 70-kDa active matriptase, purified from human milk, we are able to demonstrate that matriptase can activate pro-uPA and pro-HGF, but not plasminogen. These results reveal that a novel mechanism involving both an upstream epithelial membrane activator as well as downstream stromal effectors may play an important role in tissue remodeling. Polyclonal antibodies to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) α-chain (C-20) and β-chain (N-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Calne, Wilshire, UK). Monoclonal anti-human Met antibodies (clones dl-21 and dl-24) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The recombinant anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (RC20: HRPO) was from Transduction Laboratory (Lexington, KY). Human lung carcinoma cell line A549 was from the ATCC. Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK II) epithelial cell lines and the single-chain form HGF protein were the generous gifts from Dr. George Vande Woude (Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI). The single-chain form of human urokinase plasminogen activator (pro-uPA) was purchased from American Diagnostics Inc. (Greenwich, CT). Plasminogen, plasmin, and fluorescent substrate peptides N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (N-t-Boc)-Gln-Ala-Arg-7-Amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC), N-t-Boc-Gln-Gly-Arg-AMC,N-t-Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC,N-t-Boc-γ-benzyl (Bz)-Glu-Gly-Arg-AMC,N-t-Boc-γ-Bz-Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC,N-succinyl (Suc)-Ala-Phe-Lys-AMC,N-Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC, and Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-AMC were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). The 70-kDa active matriptase and its endogenous inhibitor HAI-1 were purified from human milk by immunoaffinity chromatography and maintained in their uncomplexed status in glycine buffer, pH 2.4, as described previously (7Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18237-18242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Matriptase and HAI-1 were further separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the gel was stained using a zinc stain kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). The 70-kDa active matriptase was sliced out and then eluted from the gel using Electro-Eluter (Bio-Rad) under non-denatured conditions (Tris-glysine buffer, pH 8.3). Alternatively, the active matriptase was purified by a high pressure liquid chromatography C18 column (Vydac VHPB5). The mobile phase was A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water; B = 95% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 1 ml/min. The gradient was set from 0 to 60% B over 8 min and at 60% B for next 7 min. The 70-kDa active matriptase was composed of two major and one minor cleaved products of the membrane-bound matriptase. The cleavage sites of the two major bands were identified to be Lys189-Ser190 and Lys204-Thr205 (the numbering of amino acid residues are based on the updated cDNA sequence of matriptase). The 70-kDa, active matriptase contains two CUB domains, four LDL receptor domains, and the serine protease domain but lacks the transmembrane domain. The enzyme activity of matriptase was measured at room temperature in a reaction buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, using a fluorescent peptide as substrate. In brief, 10 μl of enzyme solution and 10 μl of peptide substrate were added to a cuvette containing 180 μl of the reaction buffer. The mixture was mixed well, placed back into a fluorescent spectrophotometer (Hitachi F4500), and the release of fluorescence resulting from hydrolysis of the peptide substrate was recorded with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 480 nm. Substrate concentrationversus initial reaction velocity were analyzed by the Michaelis-Menten equation and plotted using SigmaPlot software. Double reciprocal (Lineweaver-Burk) plots thus derived were used to determineV max and K m values. Single chain HGF protein, plasminogen, or pro-uPA was incubated with various amounts of matriptase in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) overnight at room temperature. Incubation was stopped by boiling the mixture in SDS sample buffer. The cleaved products were then separated on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot hybridization or by silver stain. The MDCK II cell line was maintained at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The scatter assay was carried out in the 96-well culture plate (11Stoker, M., and Perryman, M. (85 A. D.) J. Cell Sci. 77, 209–223.Google Scholar). To each well was added 150 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% FCS and leupeptin at 100 μg/ml; HGF or matriptase-cleaved HGF was added into one well and serial 2-fold dilutions were made with sequential 150-μl aliquots of medium transferred from well to well. About 3000 MDCK II cells in 150 μl of medium were added to each well, and the plate was placed in a 37 °C incubator for 20–24 h. Media were removed, and cells were fixed and stained for 15 min with 5% crystal violet in 50% methanol. Cell scattering (spreading and dispersion of epithelial colonies) was examined under light microscopy. A549 cells were grown confluent in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS. After 3-hour serum starvation, cells were incubated 5 min at 37 °C with 450 ng/ml HGF or matriptase-cleaved HGF in RPMI medium supplemented with 5% FCS. As appropriate, leupeptin was included in the medium at 100 μg/ml. Media were removed, and cells were rinsed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected by centrifugation following trypsinization. After washing one more time with 1× PBS, cell pellets were frozen in dry ice. The frozen cell pellets were either stored at −80 °C for later extraction or immediately extracted as described below. Cells were thawed on ice, extracted by suspension in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × gin a microcentrifuge, and the protein concentration was determined by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin as standard. About 2 mg of protein of extracts was immunoprecipitated using anti-c-Met antibody and Pansorbin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). The protein-antibody-Pansorbin immunocomplex was collected by centrifugation, washed twice with extraction buffer then with 1× PBS, and then dissociated by boiling in SDS-sample buffer. Pansorbin was removed by centrifugation, the supernatant fractions were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were detected by Western immunoblot using anti-phosphotyrosin antibody. The same immunoblots were then stripped in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethonal, 2% SDS, and 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) for 30 min at 50 °C and reprobed with anti-c-Met antibody. In our previous study, the trypsin-like activity of matriptase was suggested by the observations that 1) an Asp residue positioned at the bottom of a substrate binding pocket of the serine protease domain of matriptase and 2) matriptase is able to cleave various synthetic substrates containing Arg or Lys as P1 sites (6Lin C.Y. Anders J. Johnson M. Sang Q.A. Dickson R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18231-18236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In the current study, to investigate in detail the substrate specificity of matriptase, we measured the K m andV max of matriptase for a variety of protease substrate peptides. Table I shows that the most reactive peptide substrates for matriptase areN-t-Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC, with aK m of 4.89 μm, and N-t-Boc-Bz-Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC, with a K m of 3.81 μm. N-t-Boc-Gln-Ala-Arg-AMC and N-t-Boc-Bz-Glu-Ala-Arg-AMC were reported to be good substrates for bovine trypsin and human factor XIa, respectively (12Kawabata S. Miura T. Morita T. Kato H. Fujikawa K. Iwanaga S. Takada K. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 172: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). No released fluorescence was detected from the substrates for chymotrypsin or elastase (Table I, peptide substrates 7, 8, and 9). Matriptase appears to prefer to bind to peptides containing small side-chain amino acids, such as Ala and Gly, at P2 site (Table I, peptide substrates 1–5). Peptides containing P2 Ala are better substrates for matriptase than peptides containing P2 Gly (compare peptides 1 and 2 with peptides 3–5). The binding affinity of matriptase to the former is about 30-fold higher than that to the latter. Interestingly, a change from Gln to Glu at the P3 site significant reduces theV max (compare peptide 1 with 2) without causing a significant change to the K m.Table IKinetic parameters of matriptase for various peptide substratesPeptide substrateP4-P3-P2-P1-AMCK mV maxμmnm AMC/min1Gln-Ala-Arg 1-aGln-Ala-Arg is a standard substrate for trypsin, Glu-Ala-Arg is a substrate for factor XIa, Leu-Gly-Arg is a substrate for uPA, Gln-Gly-Arg is a substrate for XIIa, Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr and Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe are substrates for chymotrypsin, and Ala-Ala-Ala is the substrate for elastase.4.896542Glu-Ala-Arg 1-aGln-Ala-Arg is a standard substrate for trypsin, Glu-Ala-Arg is a substrate for factor XIa, Leu-Gly-Arg is a substrate for uPA, Gln-Gly-Arg is a substrate for XIIa, Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr and Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe are substrates for chymotrypsin, and Ala-Ala-Ala is the substrate for elastase.3.8176.33Leu-Gly-Arg 1-aGln-Ala-Arg is a standard substrate for trypsin, Glu-Ala-Arg is a substrate for factor XIa, Leu-Gly-Arg is a substrate for uPA, Gln-Gly-Arg is a substrate for XIIa, Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr and Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe are substrates for chymotrypsin, and Ala-Ala-Ala is the substrate for elastase.13.63094Gln-Gly-Arg 1-aGln-Ala-Arg is a standard substrate for trypsin, Glu-Ala-Arg is a substrate for factor XIa, Leu-Gly-Arg is a substrate for uPA, Gln-Gly-Arg is a substrate for XIIa, Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr and Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe are substrates for chymotrypsin, and Ala-Ala-Ala is the substrate for elastase.33.55285Glu-Gly-Arg47.51706Ala-Phe-Lys69.95247Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr 1-aGln-Ala-Arg is a standard substrate for trypsin, Glu-Ala-Arg is a substrate for factor XIa, Leu-Gly-Arg is a substrate for uPA, Gln-Gly-Arg is a substrate for XIIa, Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr and Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe are substrates for chymotrypsin, and Ala-Ala-Ala is the substrate for elastase.- 1-bNo cleavage activity was detected with these substrates at a concentration of 200 μm.- 1-bNo cleavage activity was detected with these substrates at a concentration of 200 μm.8Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe 1-aGln-Ala-Arg is a standard substrate for trypsin, Glu-Ala-Arg is a substrate for factor XIa, Leu-Gly-Arg is a substrate for uPA, Gln-Gly-Arg is a substrate for XIIa, Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr and Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe are substrates for chymotrypsin, and Ala-Ala-Ala is the substrate for elastase.- 1-bNo cleavage activity was detected with these substrates at a concentration of 200 μm.- 1-bNo cleavage activity was detected with these substrates at a concentration of 200 μm.9Ala-Ala-Ala 1-aGln-Ala-Arg is a standard substrate for trypsin, Glu-Ala-Arg is a substrate for factor XIa, Leu-Gly-Arg is a substrate for uPA, Gln-Gly-Arg is a substrate for XIIa, Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr and Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe are substrates for chymotrypsin, and Ala-Ala-Ala is the substrate for elastase.- 1-bNo cleavage activity was detected with these substrates at a concentration of 200 μm.- 1-bNo cleavage activity was detected with these substrates at a concentration of 200 μm.10 μl of matripase solution and 10 μl of peptide substrate were added to a cuvette containing 180 μl of reaction buffer, and the release of fluorescence resulting from hydrolysis of the peptide was recorded in a fluorescence spectrophotometer at room temperature with excitation at 360 nm and emission at 480 nm.

Considering its trypsin-like activity and its presentation on the surfaces of epithelial cells and cancer cells, matriptase could serve as a cell surface activator for other secreted proteases and growth factors. Particularly relevant substrates could include those factors that are produced by stromal cells, that function on epithelial cells, and that require proteolytic cleavage at Arg or Lys for their activation. We, therefore, set out to examine whether matriptase can activate three such substrates, HGF/SF, plasminogen, and pro-uPA, in addition to characterizing the synthetic substrates for matriptase. HGF/SF is secreted as an inactive, single chain precursor by stromal cells, and it is activated by proteolytic conversion to the two-chain form factor by cleavage at Arg495 (13Naka D. Ishii T. Yoshiyama Y. Miyazawa K. Hara H. Hishida T. Kidamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20114-20119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the extracellular environment. This cleavage is required for HGF/SF to activate its cell surface receptor c-Met. To determine if HGF/SF can be cleaved by matriptase, inactive HGF/SF, purified from the condition medium of fibroblast cells cultured in the absence of serum (a generous gift from Dr. Vande Woude, Van Andel Research Institute) was utilized in the following experiments. Fig. 1 A shows that this HGF/SF preparation is primarily composed of the single-chain form protein, with an apparent size of about 97 kDa on SDS-PAGE (left lane). Because it was reported previously that there was a limited contamination of cleaved form HGF in preparations of latent form HGF (14Weidner K.M. Behrens J. Vandekerckhove J. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2097-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 15Rong S. Oskarsson M. Faletto D. Tsarfaty I. Resau J.H. Nakamura T. Rosen E. Hopkins 3rd, R.F. Vande Woude G.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 563-569PubMed Google Scholar), we wished to establish whether there was contamination in our preparation of latent HGF. As expected, we also observed minor species of 64- and 33-kDa apparent molecular mass, corresponding to the expected sizes of activation cleaved α- and β-chains of HGF/SF, respectively. After incubation with the active form matriptase, the amount of 64- and 33-kDa molecules increased at the expense of a 97-kDa molecule. The lowest amount of matriptase allowing observable HGF cleavage was at a molar ratio of approximately 500:1 for HGF:matriptase. Western immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies to α- and β-chain HGF showed that the 64-kDa species contains αHGF and the 33-kDa species contains βHGF (Fig. 1 B). The contaminating 64- and 33-kDa species in the latent HGF sample in the absence of incubation with matriptase were also detected with the respective antibodies (Fig. 1 B). The anti-αHGF antibody apparently does not recognize the single-chain form HGF/SF (Fig. 1 B). Thus, matriptase can convert the single chain HGF/SF into fragments containing α- and β-HGF. We scanned the silver-stained protein gel and the x-ray film of this Western immunoblot by densitometry and estimated the relative amounts of the full-length, α-, and β-HGF (data not shown) using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). On average, we found that areas under the α- and β-chains were 25% and 30%, respectively, of the total stained HGF. The α- and β-chains in the original HGF preparation were 25–30% of their respective values in the matriptase-cleaved sample, as determined by both silver-staining and Western immunoblotting. Therefore, we estimated that approximately 25% of the HGF in our preparation of latent HGF is in the cleaved (activated) form. To further investigate if the cleavage of HGF/SF by matriptase corresponds to a process of activation, we performed a well-characterized assay specific to HGF activity, the MDCK cell scatter assays (2Stoker M. Gherardi E. Perryman M. Gray J. Nature. 1987; 327: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 11Stoker, M., and Perryman, M. (85 A. D.) J. Cell Sci. 77, 209–223.Google Scholar). The single-chain HGF/SF was first incubated with matriptase to allow its complete cleavage; the cleaved products were than diluted in the medium and incubated with MDCK II cells for 20–24 h at 37 °C. To eliminate the possibility of activation of HGF/SF by other activators in the serum, leupeptin was included in every scattering assay (16Naldini L. Tamagnone L. Vigna E. Sachs M. Hartmann G.

It was previously observed that leupeptin can also inhibit matriptase enzyme activity (4Shi Y.E. Torri J. Yieh L. Wellstein A. Lippman M.E. Dickson R.B. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1409-1415PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 shows the images of plates of MDCK II cells after incubation with various dilutions of untreated (HGF) or matriptase-treated (HGF/MTP) HGF/SF. In the control sample (CRL), cells aggregated into tight clusters after 20–24 h culture. In the presence of 1:4096 dilution of HGF/MTP, cell islands were more scattered, and there was a high proportion of single cells. In contrast, at the same dilution of HGF, cells were not significantly different from the control cells. The scatter morphology was more profound with progressively lower dilutions of HGF/MTP. At 1:512 dilution of HGF/MTP, cells completely separated from each other and many of them exhibited elongated, fibroblast-like shapes. On the other hand, scattering morphology induced by the untreated HGF appeared at much lower dilution (Fig. 2, HGF, 1:512). For the cells incubated with untreated HGF, we consistently observed the first sign of scatter at 1:1024 dilution, compared with 1:4096 dilution for the matriptase-cleaved HGF. This difference in the scattering activity comparing matriptase-cleaved and uncleaved HGF is very close to the difference observed in the protein level demonstrated in Fig. 1. Thus the baseline scattering activity in samples treated with uncleaved HGF apparently was derived from the contaminating active HGF in the HGF/SF preparation (Fig. 1). Cells grown in the presence of matriptase alone retained the same morphology as those in the control (data not shown). Cells incubated with untreated HGF/SF in the absence of leupeptin were examined as a positive control for HGF activation by serum; the scattering activity of HGF/SF in these samples was as expected (data not shown). These observations showed that the scattering induced by HGF/MTP is indeed enhanced by the matriptase activation of HGF. HGF functions through binding to its cell surface receptor, c-Met. Upon binding to HGF, c-Met is activated following phosphorylation at tyrosine residues. In Fig. 3, c-Met activation was examined in the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line. Like the experiments for Fig. 2, leupeptin was also included in these treatments. Tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Met was observed in cells incubated with matriptase-cleaved HGF (HGF/MTP) and with untreated HGF (HGF), but not in cells incubated in the absence of HGF (No HGF). The tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Met in the cells treated with uncleaved HGF is about one-fifth of that in the cells treated with matriptase-cleaved HGF. Again, consistent with a limited degree of contamination of cleaved HGF in our latent HGF preparation. Phosphotyrosine detected in c-Met of cells incubated with untreated HGF appears to be caused by the residual active HGF contamination in the preparation. Leupeptin did not affect the total c-Met expression, the c-Met phosphorylation, nor the total pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). Plasminogen shares high homology with HGF, and its activation also requires a cleavage at Arg. Therefore, it seemed likely that plasminogen would be a substrate of matriptase as well. However, matriptase failed to cleave plasminogen. As shown in Fig.4, plasminogen remained as a 94-kDa single-chain form, even in the presence of matriptase at a concentration 8-fold higher than that required for cleavage of HGF. Plasmin has long been regarded as the enzyme that converts pro-uPA to active uPA. However, the level of active uPA is not reduced in the urine of mice bearing a targeted disruption of the plasminogen gene (17Bugge T.H. Flick M.J. Daugherty C.C. Degen J.L.

Cancer. 1995; 63: 863-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have also been reported to activate pro-uPA. However, the relevance of these studies of pro-uPA activationin vitro is uncertain for understanding roles of these enzymes in vivo. During the preparation of this manuscript, activation of pro-uPA was reported by the recombinant serine protease domain of matriptase/MT-SP1 (26Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with our studies using the purified, 70-kDa active matriptase containing both CUB and LDL domains. Fig.5 A showed that, after incubation with matriptase, the 55-kDa single-chain pro-uPA was converted into smaller fragments. One of these cleavage products clearly appeared on the protein gel as the 33-kDa molecule, which resembles the size of the active uPA protease (Fig. 5 A). The cleaved product exhibited enzymatic activity toward the fluorescent peptide substrate, N-t-Boc-Leu-Gly-Arg-AMC, for uPA (Fig. 5 B, compare the closed circles withclosed triangles). This activity was not derived from matriptase, because matriptase alone only exhibited negligible background activity (Fig. 5 B, closed squares). The same amounts of pro-uPA produced a similar activity after cleavage by plasmin (Fig. 5 B, opened circles). These results suggest that matriptase itself is able to activate pro-uPA and that the CUB domains and LDL receptor domains of matriptase do not interfere with its activation activity. By using the 70-kDa, active matriptase isolated from human milk, we report in this study that matriptase cleaves and converts HGF into a biologically functional factor that can induce c-Met activation and stimulate epithelial cell scattering. In addition, we also noted that matriptase can activate pro-uPA but not plasminogen. These results further support our working hypothesis that matriptase is an upstream regulator of cellular migration and extracellular matrix degradation. Most significantly, these results reveal a novel mechanism in the control of tissue remodeling that involves an upstream epithelial membrane activator and downstream stromal effectors. Tissue remodeling is a process observed both in physiological and pathologic processes. Two essential changes occur during these processes: 1) an epithelial-mesenchymal transition transforms relatively rigid epithelial cells to the more mobile migratory mesenchymal cells; 2) extracellular matrix degradation opens pathways for the migrating cells. HGF/SF is a potent inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (27Stewart F. Rev. Reprod. 1996; 1: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar); engagement of HGF to its epithelial receptor c-Met triggers various intracellular signaling pathways. HGF is secreted as an inactive precursor by stromal cells, and it is proteolytically activated in the extracellular environment (13Naka D. Ishii T. Yoshiyama Y. Miyazawa K. Hara H. Hishida T. Kidamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20114-20119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of HGF/SF needs to occur in the close vicinity of the epithelial cells. uPA and the zinc-dependent metalloproteinases have been proposed to be responsible for the majority of proteolysis of pericellular proteins (28Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 161-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1180) Google Scholar). However, both systems are largely synthesized by the stromal cells and require indirect mechanisms for their recruitment and activation on the surfaces of epithelial cells. Thus, an epithelial-derived protease, like matriptase, could provide a missing link in this process. Matriptase appears to have selectivity for its macromolecular substrates. In our experiments, matriptase did not cleave plasminogen, despite the high sequence homology between plasminogen and HGF. This selectivity was also reported by others utilizing the serine protease domain of matriptase (26Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In the same report, it was also shown that matriptase/MT-SP1 has selectivity for a basic residue at the P3 or P4 site. The sequence at the activation cleavage site of HGF and plasminogen is P4-(Lys)-P3-(Gln)-P2-(Gly)-P1-(Arg) and P4-(Cys)-P3-(Pro)-P2-(Leu)-P1-(Arg), respectively. Thus, the lack of a P3 or P4 basic residue in plasminogen might contribute to its lack of cleavage by matriptase. Alternatively, there might be conformational differences between HGF and plasminogen. The kringle domains of plasminogen contain a Lys-binding site that serves to mediate its localization to fibrin and to cellular surfaces. Plasminogen circulates in the blood in a globular and closed conformation; upon binding to the surface, it shifts to an extended and opened conformation. This conformation change promotes its recognition by its activator and its rapid conversion to plasmin. The kringle domains on HGF/SF also contribute to its binding to its receptor c-Met. However, cleavage activation of HGF/SF does not depend on its binding to c-Met. It is possible that the single chain form HGF/SF exhibits a more open conformation than does plasminogen and that matriptase can distinguish this subtle structural difference.

We also thank Marianne Oskarsson (National Cancer Institute, NIH, Frederick, MD) for valuable suggestions on our scattering assays.

Recent studies indicate that protein kinase B and Forkhead proteins contribute to insulin-regulated gene expression in the liver. Here, we examined the role of protein kinase B and Forkhead proteins in mediating effects of insulin on glucose-6-phosphatasepromoter activity. Transient transfection studies with reporter gene constructs demonstrate that insulin suppresses both basal and dexamethasone/cAMP-induced activity of the glucose-6-phosphatasepromoter in H4IIE hepatoma cells. Both effects are partially mimicked by coexpression of protein kinase Bα. Coexpression of the Forkhead transcription factor FKHR stimulates the glucose-6-phosphatase promoter activity via interaction with an insulin response unit (IRU), and this activation is suppressed by protein kinase B. Coexpression of a mutated form of FKHR that cannot be phosphorylated by protein kinase B abolishes the regulation of theglucose-6-phosphatase promoter by protein kinase B and disrupts the ability of insulin to regulate theglucose-6-phosphatase promoter via the IRU. Mutation of the insulin response unit of the glucose-6-phosphatase promoter also prevents the regulation of promoter activity by FKHR and protein kinase B but only partially impairs the ability of insulin to suppress both basal and dexamethasone/cAMP-stimulated promoter function. Taken together, these results indicate that signaling by protein kinase B to Forkhead proteins can account for the ability of insulin to regulateglucose-6-phosphatase promoter activity via the IRU and that other mechanisms that are independent of the IRU, protein kinase B, and Forkhead proteins also are important in mediating effects of in insulin on glucose-6-phosphatase gene expression.

Identification of the signaling events that connect the insulin receptor to the Glc-6-Pasepromoter, leading to the subsequent repression of gene transcription, is of particular interest because Glc-6-Pase plays a key role in the regulation of hepatic glucose production and blood glucose homeostasis. In H4IIE hepatoma cells, activation of class 1a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), but not of the Ras/Raf/MAP kinase pathway, is necessary for the suppression of Glc-6-Pase promoter activity by insulin (6Dickens M.

The formation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3catalyzed by PI 3-kinase has been shown to increase the activity of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) and to result in a conformational change in PKB which renders it susceptible to phosphorylation and activation by PDK1. PDK1 phosphorylates also activate other members of the AGC family of protein kinases, in addition to protein kinase B (PKB) (see Refs. 7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans indicate that signaling of PKB via Forkhead transcription factors plays an important role in mediating effects of insulin signaling, where PKB homologues (AKT1 and AKT2) are thought to suppress dauer formation via the phosphorylation of DAF-16, a member of the Forkhead/winged helix family of transcription factors.

Recently, it has been shown that recombinant FKHR is able to bind to a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing this sequence (27Ayala J.E. Streeper R.S. Desgrosellier J.S. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Barr F.G. Powell D.R. O'Brien R.M. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1885-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In the present paper, we report that FKHR is able to stimulate and that PKB is able to decrease basal and dexamethasone/cAMP-stimulated Glc-6-Pasepromoter activity. These effects are mediated by the IRU and are blocked by a PKB-insensitive FKHR mutant. Restriction endonucleases, modifying enzymes, and luciferase assay reagent were purchased from Promega. Plasmid purification systems were from Qiagen. N 6,2′-O-dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. LY294002 was from Calbiochem. All other reagents were purchased in analytical grade from either Sigma or Merck. TheGlc-6-Pase reporter gene construct Glc-6-Pase(−1227/+57) was created by cloning the human Glc-6-Pase promoter fragment −1227 to +57 into the promoterless luciferase reporter gene vector pGL3 basic (Promega) (4Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To generate the construct Glc-6-Pase(−1227/+57/IRUmut) the IRU within the vector Glc-6-Pase(−1227/+57) was mutated from −196 5′-CGATCAGGCTGTTTTTGTGTGCCTGTTTTTCTATTTTACG-3′ −156 to 5′-CGATCAGGCTCGAGTTGTGTGCCTCTTTTTCTCTTTTACG-3′ (mutated nucleotides are underlined). These mutations replace residues that are critical for mediating effects of insulin via related insulin response sequences (T(G/A)TTT) (11Liao J. Barthel A. Nakatani K. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

The construct pGL(PDH) was created by cloning nt −929 to +79 of the E1α-subunit of the humanpyruvate dehydrogenase (E1α-PDH) gene into theHindIII/XhoI sites of pGL3. The construct pGL(PDH-IRU) was created by cloning a double-stranded oligonucleotide with the sequence between nt −196 and nt −156 of the Glc-6-Pase promoter with flanking ApaI sites into the respective restriction site at nt −217 of the E1α-PDH promoter fragment in construct pGL(PDH). The expression vectors for hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged wild type PKBα (HA-PKBα), the constitutively active HA-T308D/S473D-PKBα (HA-CA-PKBα), and the “kinase-dead” mutant HA-K179A-PKBα (HA-KD-PKBα) have been described elsewhere (28Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). The expression vectors for FKHR and the TSS-Ala FKHR mutant, in which the phosphorylation sites Thr-24, Ser-256, and Ser-319 are mutated to Ala, were described previously (16Rena G. Guo S. Cichy S.C.

The construct Helix3mut FKHR was generated by site-directed mutagenesis as previously reported (17Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) using a single-stranded oligonucleotide containing the following sequence: 5′-TAGGGACAGATTAAGACGAATTGAATTGAATTCTTCCCGCCCGCCGAGCTGTT-3′. This results in the mutation of Trp-209 to Gly and His-215 to Pro. Both sites are highly conserved in Forkhead proteins. His-215 is thought to make direct contact with DNA-binding sites (29Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burkley S.K. Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar), and the mutation of His-215 alone has been shown to disrupt binding of FKHR to the IGFBP-1 insulin response element (19Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). 2 × 105 H4IIE cells were cotransfected with 8.5 μg/dish of reporter gene construct, 0.5 μg/dish of pRL-TK (Promega), and the expression vectors for PKB (2 μg/dish) or FKHR (2.4 μg/dish) as indicated using the calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitation method (4Schmoll D. Wasner C. Hinds C.J. Allan B.B. Walther R. Burchell A. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In some experiments the expression vectors were replaced by pCI-Neo (Promega) as a vector control. After the glycerol shock (15%, 2 min), the transfected cells were incubated for 1 h without serum and then in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (1 μm), Bt2cAMP (500 μm), and insulin for 18–20 h. In some experiments transfected cells were preincubated for 10 min with LY294002 (100 μm) before the other hormones were added. Cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activities were determined using the Dual-luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed at least three times each in triplicate with at least two different DNA preparations. Statistical analysis was performed using the InStat program. In order to overexpress FKHR in mammalian cells, 2 × 106 HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with 15 μg of the expression vector for FKHR or pCI-Neo using the calcium phosphate/DNA coprecipitation method. After 16 h the medium was aspirated and replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated for 12 h and then serum-starved for 12 h. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described below. 7 × 106 H4IIE or HepG2 cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then incubated with wortmannin (50 nm) for 15 min to reduce phosphorylation of Forkhead proteins that might interfere with binding. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al. (30Schreiber E. Matthias P. Müller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar), and protein content was measured by the Bio-Rad dye binding assay. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild type IRU 5′-CAGGCTGTTTTTGTGTGCCTGTTTTTCTATTTTACGTAA-3′ (IRU) or mutated IRU sequence 5′-CAGGCTCGAGTTGTGTGCCTCTTTTTCTCTTTTACGTAA-3′ (IRUmut) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. For EMSA, nuclear extracts (10 μg of protein) were incubated in a total of 20 μl with a 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (25,000 cpm) in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 12.5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 ng/μl of poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC), 500 ng/μl bovine serum albumin, 500 μm dithiothreitol) for 20 min at room temperature. Where indicated nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min with either 2 μg of an anti-FKHR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the indicated molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide competitors. Bound and free probe were resolved on 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels prior to autoradiography. 20 μg of nuclear proteins from H4IIE cells or HepG2 cells were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schüll). The filters were blocked using Blocking Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated with 0.2 μg/ml anti-FKHR antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody was alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse Ig from goat (Dianova), diluted 1:40,000 and incubated with the blot for 2 h. Detection was performed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate stock solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Serum-starved H4IIE cells were incubated in the presence or absence of dexamethasone (1 μm), Bt2cAMP (500 μm), insulin (500 nm), and the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (100 μm). At the indicated time points, cell extracts were prepared, and PKB isoenzymes were immunoprecipitated using isoform-specific antibodies (31Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were assayed for PKB activity using Crosstide as substrate, essentially as described previously (31Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). One unit of protein kinase activity was that amount that catalyzed the phosphorylation of 1 nmol of substrate in 1 min. 5 × 106 H4IIE cells were transfected in 14.5-cm dishes with 34 μg of the indicated expression vector for HA-tagged PKBα as described above. After the glycerol shock, the cells were serum-starved for 18 h and then incubated in the presence or absence of 500 nm insulin for 10 min. The cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (m/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 μm microcystin-LR. The immunoprecipitation was carried out using 1.2 mg of protein of the cell lysates and 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose coupled to 2 μg of HA monoclonal antibody for 2 h as described (28Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitate was assayed for PKB activity using Crosstide as substrate (28Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from rat H4IIE cells using the RNeasy mini-Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and quantified by absorption at 260 nm. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT)15 primers and a reverse transcription kit (Promega). FKHR cDNA were amplified by 35 cycles of PCR using Taq polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The primers for the PCR were designed based on sequences that are conserved in mouse and human FKHR using H4IIE RNA, and sequences for primers were 5′-TCATCACCAAGGCCATCGAG-3′(sense) and 5′-GTTATGAGATGCCTGGCTGC-3′(antisense). The RT-PCR product (1 kilobase pair) was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced (ALF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For RNase protection assay, a 302-bpNcoI/AccI fragment encoding nucleotides 245–547 of the RT-PCR product of rat FKHR was subcloned into pGEM5, and a cRNA complementary to FKHR RNA was synthesized in the presence of [α-32P]CTP using the Sp6 promoter. This probe (500,000 cpm) was hybridized for 18 h at 45 °C with 50 or 100 μg of total RNA from H4IIE cells and then digested with RNase T1 and RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protected fragments were separated by 8m urea, 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The probe and protected fragment were sized by comparison to φX174 DNA standards (Promega) end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Several reports have shown that insulin leads to the activation of PKB (7Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 8Alessi D.R.

J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Three isoenzymes of PKB have been described, named α, β, and γ. In order to study a potential role of PKB in the regulation of Glc-6-Pase gene expression, we first studied the activation of PKB isoenzymes in H4IIE hepatoma cells. In this study, insulin led to a strong activation of the PKBα isoform (TableI). The PKBβ isoform was also activated but to a lesser degree. No PKBγ activity was detectable (data not shown). 10 min after insulin administration half-maximal activation of the PKBα isoform was observed. The application of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 completely blocked activation of PKB by insulin. The addition of Bt2cAMP and dexamethasone reduced PKB activity after 900 min but did not disrupt the ability of insulin to stimulate PKBα activity at 120 and 900 min. These data indicate that PKBα is the predominant form activated by insulin in H4IIE hepatoma cells, which corresponds to the situation in isolated hepatocytes (31Walker K.S. Deak M. Paterson A. Hudson K. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of PI 3-kinase, which is essential for the regulation of Glc-6-Pase gene expression by insulin (6Dickens M. Svitek C.A. Culbert A.A. O'Brien R.M. Tavere J.M. J. Biol.

Using the insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) transgenic mouse in which the IGF-I transgene is expressed during skeletal muscle development and maturation prior to isolation and during culture of satellite cells (the myogenic stem cells of mature skeletal muscle fibers) as a model system, we elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms of IGF-I-mediated enhancement of proliferative potential of these cells. Satellite cells from IGF-I transgenic muscles achieved at least five additional population doublings above the maximum that was attained by wild type satellite cells. This IGF-I-induced increase in proliferative potential was mediated via activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt pathway, independent of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity, facilitating G1/S cell cycle progression via a down-regulation of p27 Kip1 . Adenovirally mediated ectopic overexpression of p27 Kip1 in exponentially growing IGF-I transgenic satellite cells reversed the increase in cyclin E-cdk2 kinase activity, pRb phosphorylation, and cyclin A protein abundance, thereby implicating an important role for p27 Kip1 in promoting satellite cell senescence. These observations provide a more complete dissection of molecular events by which increased local expression of a growth factor in mature skeletal muscle fibers extends replicative life span of primary stem cells than previously known.

Holtzer H. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 24: 508-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Satellite cells are a population of mononuclear myogenic precursor cells wedged between the basal lamina and muscle fiber sarcolemma (2Bischoff R. Engle A.G. Franzini-Armstrong C. 2nd Ed. Myology. 1. McGraw-Hill, New York1994: 97-118Google Scholar). Satellite cells differ from immortalized myogenic cell lines in that, like other normal diploid cells, they have a limited capacity to divide, and after a finite number of cell divisions enter a state of irreversible growth arrest, termed replicative senescence (3Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5489) Google Scholar). Indeed, proliferative potential of these cells has been shown to decrease in muscular dystrophies that are characterized by multiple rounds of regeneration (4Wright W.E. Exp. Cell. Res. 1985; 157: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), ultimately resulting in their cellular senescence. Therefore, when satellite cells exhaust their finite proliferative reserves, the effectiveness of regeneration, hypertrophy, and myoblast-mediated gene therapy for the reconstruction of muscle is constrained. Given the previously documented effects of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I)1 to stimulate myoblast proliferation, myogenic differentiation, and myotube hypertrophy in cultured immortalized myogenic cell lines (5Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar), and its ability to induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy in both young and old rodents (6Coleman M.E. DeMayo F. Yin K.C.

Physiol. 2000; 89: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), we asked if IGF-I might enhance the proliferative potential of the resident satellite cells within animal skeletal muscles. Such understanding, which is presently lacking in non-immortalized primary satellite cells, could be used to counteract many intractable muscle-wasting conditions. A mouse lacking the igf-1 gene in a liver-specific manner demonstrated that IGF-Is action on growth and development is largely autocrine/paracrine (10Liu J-L. Yakar S. LeRoith D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 2000; 223: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Therefore, a transgenic mouse expressing an IGF-I transgene driven by a skeletal α-actin promoter was selected (6Coleman M.E. DeMayo F. Yin K.C. Lee H.M. Geske R. Montgomery C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12109-12116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) to allow the local overexpression of IGF-I in skeletal muscles in order to mimic its autocrine effect in the resident satellite cells. We hypothesized that satellite cells from the IGF-I transgenic (IGF-I Tg) skeletal muscles exposed to continuous high levels of IGF-I might possess a prolonged ability to proliferate in culture, reflecting an increased proliferative potential, relative to those cells isolated from their FVB wild type (WT) littermates. We next asked how the IGF-I Tg satellite cells were able to have an enhanced replicative life span, when the corresponding WT satellite cells were growth-arrested? Based upon studies in other cell types (11Rittling S.R. Brooks K.M. Cristofalo V.J. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3316-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar,12Dulic V. Drullinger L.F. Lees E. Reed S.I. Stein G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), it seemed likely that this growth arrest in WT satellite cells might be at the G1/S boundary of the cell cycle, a nodal point suggested as one of the biochemical hallmark of replicative senescence. While senescent cells are refractory to mitogens and are terminally non-dividing even under the most optimal growth conditions, quiescent cells can be induced to initiate DNA synthesis by mitogenic stimulation or subcultivation (13Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Recent findings have demonstrated an accumulation of cdk-inhibitors such as p16 Ink4, p21 Cip1/Waf1, and p27 Kip1 (14Wong H. Riabowol K. Exp. Gerontol. 1996; 31: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Watanabe Y. Lee S.W. Detmar M. Ajioke I. Dvorak H.F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2025-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) in various senescent cell types, further implicating a defect in G1/S transition in cellular senescence. Since IGFs act as progression factors stimulating progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle in other cell types (5Florini J.R. Ewton D.Z. Coolican S.A. Endocr. Rev. 1996; 17: 481-517PubMed Google Scholar), we reasoned that IGF-I might extend thein vitro replicative life span of satellite cells by modulating cell cycle regulatory molecules at the G1/S boundary. IGF-I exerts its pleiotropic effects by binding to the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR) (16Cohick W.S. Clemmons D.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1993; 55: 131-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar), which leads to the activation of both PI 3′-kinase and MAPK pathways (for review, see Ref. 17Butler A.A. Yakar S. Gewolb I.H.

Therefore, we hypothesized that the IGF-I induced enhancement of cell cycle progression via modulation of G1/S regulatory molecules in the IGF-I Tg satellite cells might be signaled by either one, or both, of these pathways. Here we report that IGF-I Tg satellite cells have an enhanced in vitro replicative life span, and continued to maintain cell cycle progression via activation of the PI 3′-kinase/Akt pathway, which in turn mediated the down-regulation of p27 Kip1 even in late-passage (the point at which WT cells were senesced). Adenovirally mediated ectopic overexpression of p27 Kip1 in growing late-passage IGF-I Tg satellite cells induced a G1 arrest, and mimicked the biochemical events seen in senesced late-passage WT satellite cells, indicating that p27 Kip1 has a critical role in the regulation of satellite cell senescence. The IGF-I analog, long R3-IGF-I (LR3) was purchased from GroPep Ltd., Adelaide, Australia. PI 3′-kinase inhibitor (LY294002), MEK inhibitor (PD098059), bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd), and goat polyclonal anti-IGF-I receptor antibody, were all obtained from Sigma, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody was purchased from Caltag (Burlington, CA), and Hoescht 33342 and propidium iodide were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Rockville, MD). The human p27 Kip1 adenoviral construct was a generous gift from Dr. Perry Nisen, Abbott Laboratories (Chicago, IL). Hybridoma cells secreting anti-desmin (clone D3) and anti-sarcomeric myosin (clone MF20) antibodies were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA. FVB WT mice (aged ∼1 month) and their littermates harboring a single copy of a skeletal α-actin/hIGF-I hybrid transgene (IGF-I Tg), which express IGF-I exclusively in striated muscle have been previously described (6Coleman M.E.

Animals were housed in pathogen-free facilities and fed ad libitum. Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Immediately after the animals were euthanized by cervical dislocation, gastrocnemius muscles from both hindlimbs were removed, trimmed of excess connective tissue and fat, and weighed. Muscles from 5–6 animals from each of the two groups were pooled to provide sufficient tissue for satellite cell isolation; the methods for their isolation have been described in detail previously (9Chakravarthy M.V. Davis B.S. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These cells were cultivated on collagen-coated tissue culture plates using high serum conditions (Ham's F-10 nutrient mixture containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 1.0% chicken embryo extract, with 1% penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic mixture, and 1%l-glutamine) to minimize any loss of proliferative cells due to either apoptosis or terminal differentiation. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humid air atmosphere containing 5% CO2, and were passaged before they reached confluence. Both IGF-I Tg and WT satellite cell cultures at late-passages were monitored for myogenic purity, apoptosis, and terminal differentiation using previously described methods by staining these cells with anti-desmin antibody (9Chakravarthy M.V. Davis B.S. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Kaufman S.J. Foster R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2000; 89: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), respectively. Cumulative number of population doublings attained over the course of the in vitro culture life span of WT and IGF-I Tg satellite cells was determined as described previously (9Chakravarthy M.V. Davis B.S. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Decary S. Mouly V. Hamida C.B. Sautet A. Barbet J.P. Butler-Browne G.S. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 1429-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). At the time of cell isolation from the animal, cell populations from both groups were considered to be at 1 population doubling (PD). The number of PDs at every passage thereafter was calculated as logN/log2, whereN is the number of cells harvested divided by the number of cells inoculated. Cell number was determined in triplicate using a Coulter counter. Cultures were deemed to have reached the end of theirin vitro life span when they failed to reach subconfluence after 3 weeks of refeeding, at which point they were reassessed again with MF20 and Hoescht 33342 to ensure the loss of proliferation was not due to differentiation or apoptosis, respectively. Lack of proliferation was also assessed by BrdUrd labeling (see below). Non-confluent late-passage WT and IGF-I Tg satellite cells were trypsinized and counted using a hemacytometer to calculate cell number. About 100 cells from each group were inoculated into each of several collagen-coated 100-mm tissue culture dishes, and left for ∼7 weeks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere in serum-rich proliferation medium. Fresh growth medium was given to the cells weekly. Our previous protocol was then followed (9Chakravarthy M.V. Davis B.S. Booth F.W. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 89: 1365-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Each of the groups was cloned in triplicate and the colony sizes attained were averaged. A total of three such separate experiments were done for each of the two groups. Parallel set of cultures at the end of the 7-week growth period were stained with anti-sarcomeric myosin and anti-desmin, as described above to ensure that the cells constituting the colonies were undifferentiated and myogenic. Late-passage (day 76 in culture) satellite cells from the IGF-I Tg and WT groups were established overnight in proliferation media at 1 × 105 and 1 × 107 cells per 100-mm tissue culture dish, respectively. The cells were washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then maintained in serum-free media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 1% penicillin-streptomycin) for 48 h to arrest any cycling cells at G0. A set of plates from each group was processed for subsequent analysis immediately at the end of the 48-h period (time 0) or after serum stimulation for an additional 6, 12, or 24 h. During the last 60 min of each incubation period, the cultures were pulsed with 10 μm BrdUrd. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry (see below) to determine the percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells (labeling index). To further document that the lack of proliferation seen in the late-passaged WT cells was due to an irreversible growth arrest, early passage (day 23 in culture) and late-passage (day 76 in culture) IGF-I Tg and WT cells were treated for 48 h with the long R3-IGF-I (LR3) in serum-free media. The response to LR3 was measured by determining the BrdUrd labeling index after cultures were pulsed with 10 μm BrdUrd during the last 24 h of the LR3 incubation. Percent of nuclei labeled with BrdUrd was quantitated as described below. Late-passage WT and IGF-I Tg satellite cells from either synchronized or asynchronous cultures were pulse-labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 60 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cells were then harvested by trypsinization, and prepared for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis as described previously (24Li D. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 25Busse D. Doughty R.S. Ramsey T.T. Russell W.E. Price J.O. Flanagan W.M. Shawver L.K. Arteaga C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6987-6995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). BrdUrd-labeled nuclei were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (1 μg/ml) and counterstained with propidium iodide (20 μg/ml). Stained nuclei were analyzed in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). DNA histograms were modeled using the Modfit-LT software (Verity, Topsham, ME). Replication-defective adenovirus directing expression of human p27 Kip1 (Adp27) under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter have been previously described (26Chen J. Willingham T. Shuford M. Nisen P.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1983-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 27Chen D. Krasinski K. Chen D. Sylvester A. Chen J. Nisen P.D. Andres V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Exponentially growing late-passage cultures of IGF-I Tg cells were cultured in proliferation media to ∼50% confluence, and then incubated with the indicated amounts of adenovirus for 48 h (27Chen D. Krasinski K. Chen D. Sylvester A. Chen J. Nisen P.D. Andres V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2334-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and processed for either FACS analysis for cell cycle distribution as detailed above, or harvested for the preparation of whole cell extracts. For mock infection, cells were infected with control adenovirus with empty vector. Whole cell extracts of late-passage IGF-I Tg and WT satellite cells were prepared by lysing cells with 3 times packed cell volume of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 200 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) on ice for 30 min. Protein yield was quantified by Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of total protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and probed with appropriate antibodies. The antibodies against p27 Kip1 (06-445), cdk2 (06-505), cdk4 (06-139), cyclin E (06-459), cyclin A (06-138), cyclin D1 (5D4), p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase (06-195), phosphotyrosine (4G10), and p21 Cip1/Waf1 (05-345) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY. Antibody kits to detect phosphorylated Erk1/Erk2 (9100) and Ser473-Akt (9270) were obtained from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA. Antibodies against pRb (G3–245) and p57 Kip2 (E-17) were acquired from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA) and Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Bound antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after exposure to x-ray film (Kodak X-Omat AR). For immunoprecipitations, 500–1000 μg of total protein were incubated with antibodies to cyclin E, cyclin A, cyclin D1, cdk2, or p85 subunit of PI 3′-kinase at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by 1 h incubation with protein A-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C. After 3 washes in lysis buffer, the immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose for subsequent immunoblot analysis. Cyclin E- and cyclin-A associated kinase activities on the respective immunoprecipitates were performed using histone H1 as a substrate, as described previously (12Dulic V. Drullinger L.F. Lees E. Reed S.I. Stein G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 24Li D. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were stopped with 2 times Laemmli sample buffer and the phosphorylated histone H1 resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were subsequently dried and exposed to x-ray films. In another set of experiments, the kinase reaction was stopped by spotting 25 μl of the samples onto P81 phosphocellulose squares (Upstate Biotechnology) followed by extensive washing in 1% phosphoric acid. The filters were then dried in acetone, and counted in a β-counter with scintillation fluid. Using previously described procedures (19Milasincic D.J. Calera M.R. Farmer S.R. Pilch P.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), PI 3′-kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-p85 immunoprecipitates of late-passage IGF-I Tg and WT satellite cells was measured using phosphatidylinositol as a substrate. The products of the kinase reaction were spotted onto Silica Gel 60 plates coated with 1% potassium oxalate, and resolved by thin-layer chromatography in chloroform/methanol/water/ammonium hydroxide (60:47:11.3:2). The phosphorylated lipid products were then visualized by autoradiography. MAP kinase activity in whole satellite cell extracts was determined using myelin basic protein as a substrate provided as part of the MAP kinase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology), following the manufacturer's protocol. 25 μl of the reaction mixtures were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose squares, and the radioactivity incorporated in the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The gastrocnemius muscles of 1-month-old IGF-I Tg mice were significantly larger (22% increase, p < 0.05) than their WT littermates. Resident satellite cells from the IGF-I Tg muscles secreted more hIGF-I peptide into the media (114.9 ± 4.5 ng/ml) compared with WT satellite cells (values were below detection limits of the assay). Overexpression of the IGF-I transgene did not affect endogenous mouse IGF-I peptide levels in the satellite cells from either of the two groups, consistent with our previous observations in whole muscle (28Criswell D.S. Booth F.W. DeMayo F. Schwartz R.J. Gordon S.E. Fiorotto M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E373-E379PubMed Google Scholar). IGF-I Tg satellite cells started to proliferate earlier (4 days) in culture and proliferated in greater numbers than those from WT muscles (lag period of ∼10 days before they started to double) (Fig.1 A). Both populations underwent a period of rapid proliferation, after which the growth rates slowed, and finally ceased in WT cells after approximately 76 days in culture. Satellite cells from the IGF-I Tg group had a significantly greater proliferative capacity than the WT group, as reflected by the 119% higher (p < 0.0001) cumulative population doublings attained by the IGF-I Tg satellite cells (11.43 ± 2.1) compared with WT (5.21 ± 1.6) cells, after 76 days in culture. Thus, IGF-I Tg satellite cells achieved at least five additional rounds of divisions above the maximum that was attained by WT satellite cells. The population of satellite cells from both IGF-I Tg and WT groups at this 76-day point are henceforth referred to as the “late-passage” satellite cells, which were then used for all subsequent analyses described below. Analysis of these cultures with anti-desmin antibody routinely revealed >95% desmin-positive cells, hence ensuring that these cultures at late-passages continued to be enriched in muscle-specific cells. Late-passage satellite cells from the IGF-I Tg group showed a greater preponderance to form large-sized colonies after 7 weeks in proliferation media, compared with corresponding cells from the WT group (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). Quantitation of these colony sizes (Fig. 1 B,lower panel) demonstrated a dramatic shift to the right (i.e. colonies with ≥256 cells or ≥8 cell doublings) in IGF-I Tg satellite cells, thereby indicating a greater proliferative potential of individual cells, compared with the WT group. Profiles with ≥8 cell doublings accounted for 20–25% of the total 200–250 colonies in satellite cells from the IGF-I Tg group, in contrast to <2% for the WT group. Long-R3 IGF-I (LR3), a synthetic analog of IGF-I is more biologically potent than unmodified IGF-I as it has low affinity for IGF-I-binding proteins (18Coolican S.A. Samuel D.S. Ewton D.Z. McWade F.J. Florini J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6653-6662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Addition of LR3 at 100 ng/ml resulted in 27 and 29% incorporation of the BrdUrd label in satellite cells from WT and IGF-I Tg muscles, respectively, in early passages (day 23 in culture) (Fig.1 C). The percent of labeled nuclei at all the other doses were also comparable in both WT and IGF-I Tg satellite cells in early-passage. However, by late-passage (day 76 in culture) (Fig.1 C), BrdUrd incorporation dramatically decreased to <5% in WT cells, whereas it was maintained at 26% in the IGF-I Tg cells when stimulated by 100 ng/ml LR3, thereby confirming that WT satellite cells in late-passage had exhausted their proliferative reserves. Even without any added LR3 (Fig. 1 C), the percentage of BrdUrd-labeled nuclei in late-passage IGF-I Tg satellite cells remained at levels similar to that seen inearly-passage WT and IGF-I Tg cells (∼12.5%), validating that satellite cells overexpressing IGF-I possessed a higher proliferative capacity, compared with WT cells. The dramatic increase in proliferation potential seen in IGF-I Tg satellite cells was due to the growth-promoting effects of IGF-I since cell proliferation (measured with BrdUrd incorporation) was reduced by ∼65% when these late-passage IGF-I Tg cells were cultivated in the presence of 1 μg/ml IGF-I-receptor antibody for 48 h, relative to control cultures grown without the blocking antibody (data not shown). Of note, <3% of late-passage IGF-I Tg and WT satellite cells demonstrated sarcomeric myosin and Hoescht 33342 positive cells when cultivated in high serum conditions, indicating that the growth arrest seen in WT cells was likely not due to terminal differentiation or apoptosis, respectively. Furthermore, IGF-I Tg satellite cells from 1-month-old mice were unlikely to be immortalized secondary to continuous IGF-I overexpression, because satellite cells cultured from 18-month-old IGF-I Tg muscles (i.e. these cells were exposed to high levels of IGF-I for 18 continuous months) had lesser proliferation capacity than their WT littermates, and failed to respond to exogenously added LR3-IGF-I. 2M. V. Chakravarthy and F. W. Booth, manuscript in preparation. We asked if the lack of proliferation seen in these late-passage WT satellite cells was due to a G1 cell cycle arrest secondary to replicative senescence, since senesced cells characteristically arrest at the G1/S boundary (12Dulic V. Drullinger L.F. Lees E. Reed S.I. Stein G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11034-11038Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 13Smith J.R. Pereira-Smith O.M. Science. 1996; 273: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). FACS analysis of cell cycle distribution of asynchronous populations of late-passage WT and IGF-I Tg satellite cells in proliferation media revealed that WT cells had a 4–5-fold decrease in S-phase cell population and a concomitant accumulation of G0/G1 cells (∼85%), compared with late-passage IGF-I Tg satellite cells (Fig.2 A). These results prompted us to investigate the biochemical basis for this G1arrest. Analysis of asynchronous populations of late-passage WT satellite cells (Fig. 2 B), revealed the characteristic profiles (29Pardee A.B. Science. 1989; 246: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 30Goodrich D.W. Wang N.P. Qian Y-W. Lee E.Y-H.P. Lee W-H.

https://openalex.org/W1968091649,"We have previously shown that interleukin 1 (IL-1)-receptor-generated ceramide induces growth arrest in smooth muscle pericytes by activating an upstream kinase in the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) cascade. We now report the mechanism by which ceramide activates the SAPK signaling pathway in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293). We demonstrate that ceramide activation of protein kinase C zeta (PKCzeta) mediates SAPK signal complex formation and subsequent growth suppression. Ceramide directly activates both immunoprecipitated and recombinant human PKCzeta in vitro. Additionally, ceramide activates SAPK activity, which is blocked with a dominant-negative mutant of PKCzeta. Co-immunoprecipitation studies reveal that ceramide induces the association of SAPK with PKCzeta, but not with PKCepsilon. In addition, ceramide treatment induces PKCzeta association with phosphorylated SEK and MEKK1, elements of the SAPK signaling complex. The biological role of ceramide to induce cell cycle arrest is mimicked by overexpression of a constitutively active PKCzeta. Together, these studies demonstrate that ceramide induces cell cycle arrest by enhancing the ability of PKCzeta to form a signaling complex with MEKK1, SEK, and SAPK."

It has been reported that von Hippel-Lindau protein binds to HIF-1α and targets it for proteasome degradation (10Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G-W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C.

In hypoxia, degradation is blocked, perhaps because a targeting modification of HIF-1α requires oxygen (10Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G-W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4068) Google Scholar). It was suggested that hypoxia-mimicking agents like cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine induce HIF-1α by disrupting its association with von Hippel-Lindau protein and by impairing HIF-1 degradation by the proteasome (10Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G-W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J.

A role for a putative oxygen sensor molecule has been suggested (11Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Another model proposes that the process of sensing decreased oxygen concentration involves NADPH oxidase activity (12Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A decrease in available oxygen would result in decreased reactive oxygen species formation by NADPH oxidase, and this in turn would activate pathway(s) leading to HIF-1 induction (12Fandrey J. Frede S. Jelkmann W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 507-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Recently, a different model based on the role of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in hypoxia sensing was suggested (13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). Inhibition of complex I and complex III of mitochondrial respiratory chain blocked HIF-1 DNA binding activity and expression of HIF-1 target genes in Hep3B cells under hypoxic conditions (13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 14Semenza G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 59: 47-53Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In addition to hypoxia, several growth factors can activate HIF-1 and its target genes via different signaling pathways (15Feldser D. Agani F. Iyer N.V. Pak B. Ferreira G. Semenza G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3915-3918PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).The potential involvement of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in the physiologic regulation of the hypoxic response could be important because respiratory chain abnormalities underlie a number of human clinical disorders (reviewed in Ref. 17Schapira A.H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Specific respiratory chain defects are associated with encephalopathies, myopathies, and cardiomyopathies. Among the neurodegenerative diseases, the presence of the defect in the complex I activity is clearly established in Parkinson's disease (17Schapira A.H.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Parkinson's disease can be induced in primates and mice by MPTP, which is first converted by monoamine oxidase B in astrocytes to an active toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), followed by selective accumulation in the nigrostriatum (18Beal M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). MPP+ is taken up by dopaminergic neurons via an active transport by dopamine transporters (reviewed in Ref. 19Miller W.G. Gainetdinov R.R. Levey A.I. Caron M.G. Trends. Neurosci. 1999; 10: 424-429Google Scholar). Accumulation of MPP+ in the cell is thought to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation via inhibition of complex I, which results in energy failure and death of nigrostriatal neurons (18Beal M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 211-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 20Olanow C.W. Tatum W.G. Annu. Rev.

We used the mouse model of Parkinson's disease based on administration of MPTP to responsive C57BL/6 mice. To further ascertain the consequences of partial complex I inhibition on HIF-1α expression during hypoxia, we made use of human xenomitochondrial cybrids harboring a partial 40% complex I deficiency (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The cybrid lines were derived from fusion of the human cells depleted of mitochondria (ρo) with mitochondrial DNA from primates (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 23Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The decreased complex I activity in these cell lines is related to a number of differences in mitochondrial DNA-encoded subunits between humans and apes (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,23Kenyon L. Moraes C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9131-9135Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONThe molecular events preceding HIF-1 protein stabilization are of central importance for understanding the mechanisms of cellular oxygen sensing. It was reported that inhibition of complex I and III, but not inhibition of complex IV of mitochondrial respiratory chain, blocked expression of HIF-1 target genes in Hep3B cells during hypoxia (13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar,14Semenza G.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 59: 47-53Crossref Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated in several different ways whether complex I inhibition affects HIF-1 protein stabilization in hypoxic cells and in an animal model. We used human xenomitochondrial cybrids as a cellular model of partial complex I inhibition. Mammalian complex I has at least 43 subunits, seven of which are encoded by mitochondrial DNA. In addition to complex I, respiratory complex III, complex IV, and complex V also contain mitochondrial DNA-coded subunits; however, their activities in cybrid cell lines are not affected (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the four cybrid cell lines complex I activity is decreased by approximately 40%, and the intact cell oxygen consumption is decreased by only 20% compared with the human parental cell line (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, a partial deficit in complex I activity and a mild reduction of oxygen consumption blocked almost completely HIF-1α hypoxic induction. Importantly, in the cybrid cell line the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α could be restored by complex II substrate succinate, which maintains electron flow from complex II to complex III, confirming that electron transport chain activity is necessary for HIF-1α hypoxic induction. Consistent with this, mitochondrial complex I inhibitor MPP+ blocked the HIF-1α induction in hypoxic PC12 and CATH.a cells (Fig. 1). Rotenone (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and MPP+ (21Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Movement Disorders. 1998; 13: 35-38PubMed Google Scholar) have other complex I-independent toxic effects. These confounding factors were avoided by including cybrid cell lines in the present study. These cybrid lines have an additional advantage over ρ0 cells because they harbor an isolated complex I defect, which allowed us to test the importance of maintaining electron flow from complex II to complex III while bypassing complex I. These results further establish the crucial role of mitochondria in the complex process of oxygen sensing in mammalian cells. Our data are in agreement with previous reports that electron flux into complex III is necessary for HIF-1 activity and up-regulation of HIF-1 target genes in hypoxic cells (13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 29Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E.

The mechanisms that underlie involvement of the electron transport chain and complex III in particular, in oxygen sensing remain to be investigated. Reactive oxygen species generated at complex III are proposed as a possible candidate that mediates HIF-1 activation in hypoxia (29Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A. Rodriguez A.M. Schumacker P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25130-25138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar, 13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar).In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, administration of MPTP replicates biochemical (complex I inhibition) and clinical features of the disease. MPP+ is considered to inhibit complex I activity through direct binding to the site in the complex I that is either identical to or adjacent to the rotenone-binding site (28Ramsay R.R. Krueger M.J. Youngster S.K. Gluck M.R. Casida J.E. Singer T.P. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A single, low dose of MPTP was sufficient to cause a partial inhibition of complex I activity in the striatum and complete inhibition of HIF-1α induction after hypoxic challenge (Fig. 4). Many human mitochondrial diseases result from complex I deficiency, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes, several neuromuscular disorders, severe infantile lactic acidosis, Parkinson's disease, etc. (30Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Because of the crucial role of oxidative energy metabolism, respiratory chain deficiency can have severe consequences for cell homeostasis. Organs with high oxidative energy requirements, such as brain or muscle, are particularly vulnerable and rely on glycolysis as a means of energy production. Interestingly, some of these diseases, for example mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes, are associated with episodes of stroke, which could be due to small vessel angiopathy (30Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These small vessel abnormalities could potentially lead to local hypoperfusion and brain hypoxia. Similarly, some neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a respiratory chain deficiency are also associated with reduced cerebral blood flow (31De la Torre J.C. Acta Neuropathol. 1999; 98: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because HIF-1 typically stimulates glucose transport into cells and increases glycolytic capacity through up-regulation of genes encoding glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes during hypoxia, HIF-1 may be an important factor in promoting neuronal metabolic adaptations under these conditions. However, cells with electron transport chain deficiency may not be able to respond by activating HIF-1, which could result in a general perturbation of neuronal metabolic adaptations. Thus, HIF-1 might have neuroprotective roles in these disorders. Another possible way HIF-1 could be protective in neurodegenerative diseases, some of which are associated with electron transport chain deficiency, was recently suggested (32Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K-I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G. Ratan R. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, structurally different pharmacologic agents (cobalt chloride and iron chelator-desferrioxamine) that induce HIF-1 and mRNAs regulated by HIF-1 prevented cell death in neuronal cultures subjected to oxidative stress (32Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K-I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G. Ratan R. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was explained by their ability to stimulate aerobic glycolysis, which results in decreased reactive oxygen species formation because of two cooperative effects, increase in antioxidant pyruvate, and prevention of reactive oxygen species production by reducing the rate of glucose oxidation (32Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K-I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G. Ratan R. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, results of this study establish the importance of a functional electron transport chain in regulating HIF-1α protein stabilization during hypoxia. Importantly, a partial complex I deficiency and a mild reduction of intact cell oxygen consumption effectively blocked HIF-1 activity in xenomitochondrial cybrid cells. In agreement, a partial decrease in complex I activity caused by MPP+ blocked HIF-1α hypoxic induction in cultured cells and in an animal model. Partial complex I deficit of a similar degree is encountered in various human mitochondriopathies, suggesting that HIF-1-mediated hypoxic responses might be impaired in these disorders. Mammalian cells are able to sense decreased oxygen availability and activate adaptational responses including transcriptional activation of several hypoxia-inducible genes: erythropoietin, vascular endothelial growth factor, glycolytic enzymes, and glucose transporters. This allows increased O2 delivery through enhanced erythropoiesis, angiogenesis and metabolic adaptations that facilitate glycolytic ATP production (reviewed in Ref. 1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the erythropoietin gene is controlled via an enhancer element located in the 3′-flanking region of the gene and requires binding of a specific transcription factor termed hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1)1 (2Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). Identification and cloning of HIF-1 revealed a heterodimeric protein consisting of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β (3Wang G.L. Jiang B-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4972) Google Scholar, 4Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). Both subunits belong to a family of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors containing a PER-ARNT-SIM homology domain (3Wang G.L. Jiang B-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4972) Google Scholar, 4Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1693) Google Scholar). HIF-1β, previously identified as ARNT (aryl hydrocarbon receptornuclear translocator), is a common binding partner for other members of the family (5Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F-F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar), whereas HIF-1α is the subunit regulated by cellular O2 tension (3Wang G.L. Jiang B-H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Both subunits are required for DNA binding and transactivation of HIF-1 target genes (3Wang G.L. Jiang B-H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4972) Google Scholar). The consensus DNA binding sequence for HIF-1 is 5′-RCGTG-3′ (7Semenza G.L. Jiang B-H. Leung S.W. Passantino R. Concordet J-P Maire P. Giallongo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32529-32537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions HIF-1α protein undergoes rapid degradation by a proteasome (8Huang L.E.

In addition to complex I, respiratory complex III, complex IV, and complex V also contain mitochondrial DNA-coded subunits; however, their activities in cybrid cell lines are not affected (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In the four cybrid cell lines complex I activity is decreased by approximately 40%, and the intact cell oxygen consumption is decreased by only 20% compared with the human parental cell line (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, a partial deficit in complex I activity and a mild reduction of oxygen consumption blocked almost completely HIF-1α hypoxic induction. Importantly, in the cybrid cell line the hypoxic induction of HIF-1α could be restored by complex II substrate succinate, which maintains electron flow from complex II to complex III, confirming that electron transport chain activity is necessary for HIF-1α hypoxic induction. Consistent with this, mitochondrial complex I inhibitor MPP+ blocked the HIF-1α induction in hypoxic PC12 and CATH.a cells (Fig. 1). Rotenone (22Barrientos A. Kenyoni L. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14210-14217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and MPP+ (21Przedborski S. Jackson-Lewis V. Movement Disorders. 1998; 13: 35-38PubMed Google Scholar) have other complex I-independent toxic effects. These confounding factors were avoided by including cybrid cell lines in the present study. These cybrid lines have an additional advantage over ρ0 cells because they harbor an isolated complex I defect, which allowed us to test the importance of maintaining electron flow from complex II to complex III while bypassing complex I. These results further establish the crucial role of mitochondria in the complex process of oxygen sensing in mammalian cells. Our data are in agreement with previous reports that electron flux into complex III is necessary for HIF-1 activity and up-regulation of HIF-1 target genes in hypoxic cells (13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar, 29Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E.

The mechanisms that underlie involvement of the electron transport chain and complex III in particular, in oxygen sensing remain to be investigated. Reactive oxygen species generated at complex III are proposed as a possible candidate that mediates HIF-1 activation in hypoxia (29Chandel N.S. McClintock D.S. Feliciano C.E. Wood T.M. Melendez J.A.

A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar).In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, administration of MPTP replicates biochemical (complex I inhibition) and clinical features of the disease. MPP+ is considered to inhibit complex I activity through direct binding to the site in the complex I that is either identical to or adjacent to the rotenone-binding site (28Ramsay R.R. Krueger M.J. Youngster S.K. Gluck M.R. Casida J.E. Singer T.P. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A single, low dose of MPTP was sufficient to cause a partial inhibition of complex I activity in the striatum and complete inhibition of HIF-1α induction after hypoxic challenge (Fig. 4). Many human mitochondrial diseases result from complex I deficiency, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes, several neuromuscular disorders, severe infantile lactic acidosis, Parkinson's disease, etc. (30Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Because of the crucial role of oxidative energy metabolism, respiratory chain deficiency can have severe consequences for cell homeostasis. Organs with high oxidative energy requirements, such as brain or muscle, are particularly vulnerable and rely on glycolysis as a means of energy production. Interestingly, some of these diseases, for example mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes, are associated with episodes of stroke, which could be due to small vessel angiopathy (30Schon E.A. Bonilla E. DiMauro S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). These small vessel abnormalities could potentially lead to local hypoperfusion and brain hypoxia. Similarly, some neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a respiratory chain deficiency are also associated with reduced cerebral blood flow (31De la Torre J.C. Acta Neuropathol. 1999; 98: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because HIF-1 typically stimulates glucose transport into cells and increases glycolytic capacity through up-regulation of genes encoding glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes during hypoxia, HIF-1 may be an important factor in promoting neuronal metabolic adaptations under these conditions. However, cells with electron transport chain deficiency may not be able to respond by activating HIF-1, which could result in a general perturbation of neuronal metabolic adaptations. Thus, HIF-1 might have neuroprotective roles in these disorders. Another possible way HIF-1 could be protective in neurodegenerative diseases, some of which are associated with electron transport chain deficiency, was recently suggested (32Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K-I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G. Ratan R. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, structurally different pharmacologic agents (cobalt chloride and iron chelator-desferrioxamine) that induce HIF-1 and mRNAs regulated by HIF-1 prevented cell death in neuronal cultures subjected to oxidative stress (32Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K-I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G. Ratan R. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This was explained by their ability to stimulate aerobic glycolysis, which results in decreased reactive oxygen species formation because of two cooperative effects, increase in antioxidant pyruvate, and prevention of reactive oxygen species production by reducing the rate of glucose oxidation (32Zaman K. Ryu H. Hall D. O'Donovan K. Lin K-I. Miller M.P. Marquis J.C. Baraban J.M. Semenza G. Ratan R. J. Neuroscience. 1999; 19: 9821-9830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In summary, results of this study establish the importance of a functional electron transport chain in regulating HIF-1α protein stabilization during hypoxia. Importantly, a partial complex I deficiency and a mild reduction of intact cell oxygen consumption effectively blocked HIF-1 activity in xenomitochondrial cybrid cells. In agreement, a partial decrease in complex I activity caused by MPP+ blocked HIF-1α hypoxic induction in cultured cells and in an animal model. Partial complex I deficit of a similar degree is encountered in various human mitochondriopathies, suggesting that HIF-1-mediated hypoxic responses might be impaired in these disorders. The molecular events preceding HIF-1 protein stabilization are of central importance for understanding the mechanisms of cellular oxygen sensing. It was reported that inhibition of complex I and III, but not inhibition of complex IV of mitochondrial respiratory chain, blocked expression of HIF-1 target genes in Hep3B cells during hypoxia (13Chandel N.S. Maltepe E. Goldwasser E. Mathieu C.E. Simon M.C. Schumacker P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11715-11720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar,14Semenza G.L. Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W2329391383,"Akt (or PKB) is an oncogene involved in the regulation of cell survival. Akt is regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3′K) signaling and has shown to be hyperactivated through the loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor. In Drosophila, insulin signaling as studied using the Drosophila IRS-4 homolog (Chico) has been shown to be a crucial regulator of cell size. We have studied Drosophila Akt (Dakt1) and have shown that it is also involved in the regulation of cell size. Furthermore we have performed genetic epistasis tests to demonstrate that in Drosophila, PI3′K, PTEN and Akt comprise a signaling cassette that is utilized during multiple stages of development. In addition, we show that this signaling cassette is also involved in the regulation of cell survival during embryogenesis. This study therefore establishes the evolutionary conservation of this signaling pathway in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2045374621,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) has been shown to interact with an immunophilin-like molecule known as AhR-interacting protein (AIP) and to enhance AhR function. We show here that AIP associates with AhR homologues from mouse and fish, which can bind ligands such as dioxin, but nonligand binding homologues fromCaenorhabditis elegans or Drosophila do not bind to AIP. However, a minimal ligand-binding domain of the AhR is incapable of binding AIP. The binding of AIP to AhR in reticulocyte lysate shows several of the characteristics of an hsp90-dependent process, including sensitivity to geldanamycin and temperature and a requirement for ATP or nonhydrolyzable analogues. Purified AIP binds to the C terminus of hsp90, and mutation of a conserved basic residue in the tetratricopeptide repeats of AIP (K266A, analogous to K97A in protein phosphatase 5) abolishes binding to hsp90. Mutation of K266A in AIP reduces binding to AhR by 75–80%; the geldanamycin sensitivity of this complex shows that AhR stabilizes the AIP-hsp90-AhR complex. The α-helical C terminus of AIP, which is outside the tetratricopeptide repeat domain, is absolutely required for binding to AhR as shown by deletions of the C-terminal 5 amino acids or alanine-scanning mutagenesis, but it is not required for binding of AIP to hsp90. The data support a model where 1) AIP binds to both hsp90 and AhR; 2) hsp90 is required for AhR-AIP binding; and 3) the binding of AhR to AIP stabilizes the AIP-hsp90-AhR complex.

Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1982; 22: 517-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (2319) Google Scholar). Activation of the AhR by TCDD leads to a wide variety of responses, including acute toxicity, teratogenicity, and cancer (1Poland A. Knutson J.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

The AhR is constitutively cytoplasmic, bound to hsp90. Upon binding TCDD, it translocates to the nucleus, where hsp90 is removed and a transcriptionally active AhR-arnt complex is formed. The activated, nuclear AhR is subject to controlled degradation (5Roberts B.J. Whitelaw M.L. J. Biol.

However, it is unclear how AIP enhances AhR function.AIP possesses similarity to the immunophilins, notably FKBP52. Several of the immunophilins, including FKBP52, are known to bind to hsp90 and are co-chaperones that are associated with nuclear hormone receptors (14Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Some of the characteristic features of the hsp90-immunophilin assembly system include dependence on cation (15Hutchison K.A. Czar M.J. Scherrer L.C. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14047-14053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), temperature and ATP (16Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1350-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and sensitivity to the specific inhibitor of hsp90, geldanamycin (17Panaretou B. Prodromou C. Roe S.M. Obrien R. Ladbury J.E.

However, unlike FKBP52, AIP does not bind to FK-506 or rapamycin (11Carver L.A. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11452-11456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and there is conflicting evidence about the ability of AIP to bind to hsp90. AIP has been shown to associate with hsp90 in mammalian cells (8Ma Q. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol.

It is difficult to reconcile these observations, because variation in temperature (16Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

We show that, in reticulocyte lysate, AIP-AhR interactions show characteristics of an active process requiring hsp90, we demonstrate a direct interaction between AIP and hsp90, and we show that distinct regions of AIP are required for interaction with hsp90 and AhR, respectively.RESULTSThe AIP construct, pAIP/ET28a, has an N-terminal T7 tag sequence, which was efficiently recognized by an anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody in an immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 1). The use of Sepharose beads lacking protein A or an irrelevant monoclonal antibody failed to yield any specific immunoprecipitation of the T7-tagged AIP protein (data not shown). AIP and the murine AhR b-1 allele were translated separately in a coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system in the presence of [35S]methionine. The AhR and AIP translation reactions were mixed and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h, prior to the addition of antibody. Fig. 1 A shows that the anti-T7 tag antibody failed to immunoprecipitate the AhR protein by itself. When the T7-tagged AIP was mixed with AhR, both proteins were immunoprecipitated, demonstrating the presence of a complex containing both AhR and AIP. Specific interaction between AIP and AhR was confirmed by showing that AhR bound to a glutathioneS-transferase-AIP fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose CL-4B, whereas glutathioneS-transferase showed minimal interaction with AhR (data not shown; see Fig. 6 D). We examined the interaction between AIP and AhR orthologues from Caenorhabditis elegans(22Powell-Coffman J.A. Bradfield C.A. Wood W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2844-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), Drosophila (23Duncan D.M. Burgess E.A. Duncan I.

Chem. 1999; 274: 33814-33824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), which were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation assay with AIP (Fig. 1 A). TheFundulus AhR2 was co-immunoprecipitated with AIP, but theC. elegans and Drosophila orthologues, which do not bind dioxin, failed to show any co-immunoprecipitation with AIP, even when present in excess. These data show a correlation between the dioxin binding functionality of the AhR and association with AIP, suggesting that the ligand-binding domain may have a crucial role in AIP-AhR interaction. This is in agreement with previous reports that deletions of the AhR ligand-binding domain ablate AIP-AhR interactions (12Carver L.A. LaPres J.J. Jain S. Dunham E.E. Bradfield C.A. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8907-8917Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, a minimal fragment of the AhR ligand-binding domain containing amino acids Leu229–Pro416was not co-immunoprecipitated by the T7 tag antibody (Fig.1 B); this minimal AhR ligand-binding domain containing amino acids Leu229–Pro416 retains ligand binding activity (25Coumailleau P.

This provides evidence that the AhR-AIP interactions necessary for co-immunoprecipitation require specific sequence motifs within the AhR and that the ligand-binding domain itself is not sufficient for binding AIP.Figure 1A functional ligand-binding domain of AhR is required but not sufficient for AhR-AIP interaction. A, murine b-1 AhR, C. elegans AhR, Drosophilaspineless, F. heteroclitus AhR2, and murine AIP were translated in a reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the reaction products were incubated together for 1 h at 30 °C.

Essentially similar results were obtained when the amount of immunoprecipitated AhR was normalized to the amount of immunoprecipitated AIP (data not shown). The temperature dependence of this interaction is a characteristic of ATP-dependent, hsp90-mediated processes (16Smith D.F. Stensgard B.A. Welch W.J. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

After translation of AIP and AhR cDNAs, the reticulocyte lysates were extensively dialyzed by centrifugation using a Centricon column with a molecular mass cut-off of 10 kDa (19Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The indicated nucleotide was then added to the mixture, and AhR-AIP interactions were assayed by co-immunoprecipitation with AIP. The process of diafiltration reduced AhR-AIP interactions (Fig.3 A) compared with the nondiafiltered control tracks (compare lanes 1 and9); the residual binding in diafiltered lysates varied between 5 and 15%, depending on the batch of lysate. This shows that AhR-AIP interactions require a small molecular mass molecule or molecules. ADP provided a small increase in AIP-AHR interactions, but 2 mm ATP restored AIP-AHR interactions (Fig. 3). The nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, ATPγS, further enhanced the interaction between AIP and AhR, but the combination of ATP and 10 mmsodium molybdate had no further effect over ATP. Thus ATP is necessary for AIP-AhR interactions and can be substituted by nonhydrolyzable analogues.Figure 3Effect of nucleotides and analogues on AhR-AIP co-immunoprecipitation. A, immunoprecipitations of T7-tagged AIP with an α-T7 tag antibody were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 1 A. The position of AhR is shown by an arrowhead, and AIP is shown by anarrow. Reticulocyte lysates containing translation products were prepared and either stored on ice (Untreated lysate) or diafiltered extensively against a solution of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm DTT (Post-diafiltration). The translation products were incubated in the indicated combinations, or with the addition of 2 mm ADP, ATP, ATP + 10 mm sodium molybdate (ATP+Mo), or 1 mm ATPγS. Solutions containing ATP were supplemented with 10 mm phosphocreatine and 14 units/ml creatine kinase. B, the data in Awere quantified on a PhosphorImager and plotted.

Reticulocyte lysates containing AIP or AhR translation products were mixed and incubated in the presence of geldanamycin in Me2SO, or the vehicle, followed by immunoprecipitation. Geldanamycin was a potent inhibitor (Fig.4 A), showing almost total inhibition of AIP-AhR interactions at 1 μg/ml, in good agreement with previous data for the inhibition of hsp90-p23 interactions (19Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Me2SO had no significant effect on the co-immunoprecipitation of AhR. AhR is rapidly degraded in cells after addition of geldanamycin (26Chen H.S. Singh S.S. Perdew G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but AhR was stable in the presence of geldanamycin in reticulocyte lysates (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that the reduced co-immunoprecipitation of AhR with AIP is not due to degradation of the AhR. The known specificity of geldanamycin as a ligand of the ATP-binding site of hsp90 provides evidence that an ATP-dependent step in AIP-AhR interactions is catalyzed by hsp90 during the process of assembly of an AhR-AIP chaperone complex.Figure 4Geldanamycin inhibits the formation of AIP-AhR complexes. A, immunoprecipitations of T7-tagged AIP with an α-T7 tag antibody, as described for Fig. 1 A, except that the co-incubation of AhR (6 μl) and AIP (2 μl) was made up to 40 μl with unprogrammed lysate, and samples contained either 2.5% Me2SO, or 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) containing geldanamycin (GA) at final concentrations of 5, 1, 0.2, and 0.04 μg/ml, respectively. B, AhR was translated in a reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine, and aliquots of lysate were incubated for 1 h at 4, 30, or 30 °C with the addition of 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) alone or 2.5% dimethyl sulfoxide containing geldanamycin (GA), at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml.

Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 provide evidence for a role of hsp90 in AIP-AhR interactions. To test whether AIP directly binds to hsp90, as opposed to through some intermediary protein in a complex, AIP was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (8Ma Q. Whitlock J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8878-8884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and purified. The C terminus of hsp90 has been shown to bind to several immunophilins containing tetratricopeptide repeats (21Carrello A. Ingley E. Minchin R.F. Tsai S. Ratajczak T. J. Biol.

Ratajczak T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2682-2689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) was expressed and purified. As shown in Fig. 5, the hsp90 C-terminal fragment binds to the GST-AIP fusion protein (compare lanes 5 and9) but does not bind to GST alone (compare lanes 1 and 3), demonstrating that the interaction is between AIP and hsp90β530–724. The interaction was specific: bovine serum albumin failed to bind to the GST-AIP protein (lane 8). The binding between AIP and hsp90β530–724 was equivalent in the presence of NaCl (lane 10) or KCl. Thus AIP binds specifically to the C-terminal region of hsp90β. Neither magnesium ions (2–5 mm) nor 5 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, or ADP had any effect on the binding of AIP to hsp90β530–724 (data not shown) (28Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).To test whether the capacity to bind hsp90 is required for AIP function, we made use of the known structure of the related tetratricopeptide repeat protein, protein phosphatase 5 (29Das A.K. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1192-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), and the identification of amino acids that are putative contact residues for hsp90 (30Russell L.C. Whitt S.R. Chen M.S. Chinkers M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20060-20063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 A, two conserved basic residues in the putative substrate contact groove in protein phosphatase 5 (Lys97 and Arg101), are conserved in FKBP52 and AIP (Lys266 and Lys270, respectively). Lysine 266 in AIP was mutated to alanine and expressed as a GST fusion protein. The purified protein failed to bind the hsp90 C-terminal fragment (Fig. 6, B and C), although wild type AIP bound the hsp90 C-terminal peptide (Fig. 6, Band C, and Fig. 5). The GST-AIP fusion proteins were tested for co-purification with AhR using a glutathione affinity procedure (Fig. 6 D). The GST-AIP fusion bound AhR, but glutathioneS-transferase by itself failed to interact with AhR. This binding was specific, because it required the presence of the glutathione affinity matrix on the Sepharose CL-4B beads, and no binding was seen in the absence of radiolabeled AhR. Mutation of AIP at K266A consistently reduced the ability of AIP to bind to AhR by 75–80% (Fig. 6 D); this binding was hsp90-dependent, because geldanamycin markedly inhibited the binding of AhR to GST-AIP under these conditions (data not shown).We next sought to define specific regions of AIP that are required for AIP-AhR interactions. C-terminally deleted mutants of AIP were designed to remove the last tetratricopeptide repeat or regions of the C terminus after the repeat sequences (Fig.7 A). The mutants were translated in a reticulocyte lysate system and assayed for their ability to bind to AhR. All of the mutants yielded adequate levels of translation product, but none were able to co-immunoprecipitate AhR (Fig. 7 B). An AIP mutant truncated at amino acid 325, lacking only the last 5 amino acids, failed to co-immunoprecipitate AhR, even when present at higher levels than the full-length AIP (Fig.7 C). The last 5 amino acids of AIP appear to be essential for AIP-AhR interactions. To complement the approach of C-terminal deletion, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the last 5 amino acids (325-GIFSH) was undertaken. Replacement of amino acids 327–330 with an alanine resulted in almost complete loss of binding to AhR; however, replacement of Gly326 with alanine yielded a mutant that retained partial immunoprecipitation of AhR (Fig. 7 D). The C terminus of AIP is required for AIP-AhR interactions, and replacement of any of the last four amino acids ablates AIP-AHR interactions.Figure 7Immunoprecipitation of AhR by C-terminal AIP mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2166510809,"Induction of apoptosis by DNA-damaging agents, such as etoposide, is known to involve the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, although the mechanism responsible for this event is unclear. In the present study, using Jurkat T-lymphocytes, a reconstituted cell-free system, or isolated liver mitochondria, we demonstrate the ability of etoposide to induce cytochrome c release via two distinct pathways. Caspase inhibition by either benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk) or benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Asp-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VDVAD-fmk) attenuates cytochrome c release triggered by a low dose of etoposide via an apparent inhibition of nuclear events involving the release of protein factor(s) that is (are) able to interact with mitochondria. In contrast, caspase inhibition has no effect on cytochrome c release induced by a higher dose of etoposide. Moreover, the higher dose of etoposide heightens the sensitivity of Ca(2+)-loaded isolated mitochondria to mitochondrial permeability transition, an effect that is completely abolished by cyclosporin A. Interestingly, cyclosporin A is ineffective at preventing similar mitochondrial damage in Jurkat cells treated with etoposide. We propose that lower doses of etoposide predominantly target the nucleus and stimulate the release of caspase-sensitive protein factor(s) that interact with mitochondria to trigger cytochrome c release, whereas higher doses of the drug impart a more direct effect on mitochondria and thus are not mitigated by caspase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2144645004,"Membrane cofactor protein (MCP; CD46), a widely distributed regulator of complement activation, is a cofactor for the factor I-mediated degradation of C3b and C4b deposited on host cells. MCP possesses four extracellular, contiguous complement control protein modules (CCPs) important for this inhibitory activity. The goal of the present study was to delineate functional sites within these modules. We employed multiple approaches including mutagenesis, epitope mapping, and comparisons to primate MCP to make the following observations. First, functional sites were located to each of the four CCPs. Second, some residues were important for both C3b and C4b interactions while others were specific for one or the other. Third, while a reduction in ligand binding was invariably accompanied by a parallel reduction in cofactor activity (CA), other mutants lost or had reduced CA but retained ligand binding. Fourth, two C4b-regulatory domains overlapped measles virus interactive regions, indicating that the hemagglutinin docks to a site important for complement inhibition. Fifth, several MCP regulatory areas corresponded to functionally critical, homologous positions in other CCP-bearing C3b/C4b-binding proteins. Based on these data and the recently derived crystal structure of repeats one and two, computer modeling was employed to predict MCP structure and examine active sites."
https://openalex.org/W2150008564,"The autosomal recessive disorder primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is caused by a deficiency of the liver-specific pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent enzyme alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT). Numerous mutations and polymorphisms in the gene encoding AGT have been identified, but in only a few cases has the causal relationship between genotype and phenotype actually been demonstrated. In this study, we have determined the effects of the most common naturally occurring amino acid substitutions (both normal polymorphisms and disease-causing mutations) on the properties, especially specific catalytic activity, of purified recombinant AGT. The results presented in this paper show the following: 1) normal human His-tagged AGT can be expressed at high levels in Escherichia coli and purified in a correctly folded, dimerized and catalytically active state; 2) presence of the common P11L polymorphism decreases the specific activity of purified recombinant AGT by a factor of three; 3) AGTs containing four of the most common PH1-specific mutations (G41R, F152I, G170R, and I244T) are all soluble and catalytically active in the absence of the P11L polymorphism, but in its presence all lead to protein destabilization and aggregation into inclusion bodies; 4) naturally occurring and artificial amino acid substitutions that lead to peroxisome-to-mitochondrion AGT mistargeting in mammalian cells also lead to destabilization and aggregation in E. coli; and 5) the PH1-specific G82E mutation abolishes AGT catalytic activity by interfering with cofactor binding, as does the artificial K209R mutation at the putative site of cofactor Shiff base formation. These results are discussed in the light of the high allelic frequency (∼20%) of the P11L polymorphism and its importance in determining the phenotypic manifestations of mutations in PH1."

Cell. 1997; 89: 981-990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). These functional differences correspond to diverse signal transduction properties. VEGFR2 undergoes strong ligand-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas VEGFR1 shows a weak response (6Seetharam L. Gotoh N. Maru Y. Neufeld G. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 135-147PubMed Google Scholar, 13Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, although both receptors activate the serine/threonine kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase, VEGFR1 is not able to mediate the mitogenic effect of VEGF in endothelial cells (14Landgren E. Schiller P. Cao Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This suggests that the tyrosine kinase pathway predominates in the mitogenic actions of VEGF. A new class of SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules has been found recently to be involved in mediating the growth-promoting activity of other growth factors such as PDGF and EGF (epidermal growth factor) (15Park O. Schaefer T. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 16Schindler C. Darnell J.E.J. Annu. Rev.

These signaling molecules belong to a family of latent cytoplasmic transcription factors known as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT). To date, seven mammalian STATs (STAT1, -2, -3, -4, -5A/B, -6) have been identified. Biochemical and molecular analysis have indicated that STAT activity is regulated predominantly by phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues, which causes the STATs to dimerize. STAT dimerization is usually followed by translocation into the nucleus (18Decker T. Kovarik P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, STATs recognize and bind to consensus DNA binding sites that represent enhancer sequences for a variety of genes, including the immediate early growth response genes. STATs are the only known phosphotyrosine-dependent transcription factors. VEGF receptors share functional and structural homologies with other intrinsic tyrosine kinase receptors, such as PDGF receptor, which have been shown to activate STAT proteins (1Ferrara N. Davis-Smyth T. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 4-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (3668) Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto H. Crow M. Cheng L. Lakatta E. Kinsella J. Exp. Cell. Res. 1996; 222: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, activation of VEGF receptors induces transcriptional activation of immediate early growth response genes, such as c-fos, without requiringde novo synthesis of new transcription factors (20van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 21Thakkker G.D. Hajjar D.P. Muller W.A. Rosengart T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10002-10007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Because PDGF receptor activation has been shown to cause STAT activation (16Schindler C. Darnell J.E.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that VEGF signaling also involves the STAT signaling pathway. To test this hypothesis, we treated cultured BAECs with recombinant human VEGF165 (rhVEGF165). Tyrosine-phosphorylated STATs were then detected in cellular and nuclear fraction extracts by immunoprecipitation and Western analysis. Confocal immunocytochemistry was conducted to monitor the intracellular mobilization of STATs following VEGF stimulation. Genistein was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. rhVEGF165 and placenta growth factor (PlGF) were from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Monoclonal antibodies against STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, STAT6, JAK1, Tyk2, and phosphotyrosine (PY20) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-JAK2 antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), protein A/G-agarose beads, anti-phosphotyrosine PY99, and a polyclonal antibody against VEGFR2 (Flk-1/KDR) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6 were from New England Biolabs, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Propidium iodide and Oregon Green-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Endothelial cell primary cultures were prepared as described (22Behzadian M.A. Wang X.L. Jiang B. Caldwell R.B. Glia. 1995; 15: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cells were used between passages 2 and 6. Eighty-five percent confluent BAEC cultures were switched to serum-free medium for 16–18 h and then treated with rhVEGF165 for different times. A dose dependence curve established the effective dose of VEGF for STAT activation as 10 ng/ml. Incubations were terminated by washing the cells twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mmNa3VO4 and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). Cell lysates were obtained using lysis buffer (Tris-HCl 20 mm (pH 7.4), EDTA 2.5 mm, NaF 50 mm, Na4P2O7 10 mm, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm PMSF, and 2 mm Na3VO4). Immunoprecipitation and Western analysis were done as described (23Marrero M. Schieffer B., WG, P. Heerdt L. Berk B. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 24Marrero M.B. Schieffer B. Li B. Sun J. Harp J.B. Ling B.N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25130-25135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of STAT proteins and Flk-1/KDR was carried out. STAT proteins in nuclear fractions were detected by Western blotting analysis. Purified nuclei were prepared using a 350 mm sucrose cushion, and nuclear extracts were obtained as described (27Feng Y. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. Tsai N. Caldwell R.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 256: 192-197Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (25 μg protein/well) were then subjected to SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using anti-STAT antibodies. Intracellular mobilization of STATs in response to VEGF treatment was also analyzed by confocal immunocytochemistry following a procedure described previously (27Feng Y. Venema V.J. Venema R.C. Tsai N. Caldwell R.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 256: 192-197Google Scholar). The expression of STAT proteins differs in different cell types. Western blotting analysis of cell lysates from untreated BAECs showed that these cells express only four STAT family members: STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6. Therefore, we examined the activation pattern of these STATs in response to stimulation with rhVEGF165 by following their tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation into the nuclear compartment. VEGF165 is the predominant molecular species and has been shown to have potent angiogenic activity in BAECs (28Xia P. Aiello L.P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 was detected in VEGF-treated BAEC using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting techniques. Fig. 1 A shows that VEGF stimulation resulted in a rapid and transient STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Maximal tyrosine phosphorylation was detected at 15 and 30 min, returning to basal levels at 60 min. Fig. 1 Bshows that STAT1 was present in nuclear extracts at 30 and 40 min after VEGF stimulation. Confocal microscope immunocytochemistry confirmed these results. Fig. 2 shows that STAT1 immunoreactivity was undetectable in unstimulated BAECs (panel A) but became evident perinuclearly and within the nuclear compartment 30 min after VEGF stimulation (panel B). This rapid onset in STAT1 immunoreactivity with VEGF stimulation probably represents increased protein affinity and/or accessibility to the antibody consequent to STAT1 mobilization and dimerization because significant increases in STAT1 protein levels are unlikely to occur during the 15- and 30-min treatment times. Increases in STAT1 immunoreactivity have also been observed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells following STAT1 activation by urokinase (29Dumler I. Kopmann A. Weis A. Mayboroda O.A. Wagner K. Gulba D.C. Haller H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Figure 1VEGF-induced STAT1 activation. BAECs were treated with rhVEGF165 for the indicated times. A, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) and probed with anti-STAT1. The same results were obtained when immunoprecipitation was done using anti-STAT1 and the blots (WB, Western blot) probed with PY20. B, purified nuclear extracts were immunoblotted with anti-STAT1 antibody to monitor STAT1 translocation in the nuclear fraction of activated BAECs. These results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Our data show that VEGF stimulation of BAECs results in STAT1 activation. STAT1 was first identified as a critical component of interferon (IFN)-stimulated transcription factor activation. Gene targeting studies also suggested a prominent role of STAT1 in modulating IFN-dependent natural immunity (30Levy D.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, growth-promoting agents such as PDGF and angiotensin II also activate STAT1 (17Schindler C. Brutsaert S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1509-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23Marrero M. Schieffer B., WG, P. Heerdt L. Berk B. Delafontaine P. Bernstein K. Nature. 1995; 375: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of STAT members along with expression studies of gain- and loss-of-function alleles have indicated a role for the STATs in cell growth and survival responses (31Mui A.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1547-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). STAT1 constitutive activation has been associated with uncontrolled growth in several malignancies. Moreover, the chemotherapeutic drug fludarabine has been found to exert its anti-tumor activity by inhibiting STAT1 expression (32Frank D. Mahajan S. Ritz J. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 444-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Therefore, STAT1 activation in endothelial cells is likely to play a role in controlling endothelial cell growth and survival. The next experiments determined the tyrosine phosphorylation pattern of STAT6 in response to VEGF stimulation. As is shown in Fig. 3 A, immunoreactivity corresponding to tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT6 was evident 30 and 60 min after VEGF stimulation. STAT6 was localized in the nuclear fraction 60 min after VEGF stimulation (Fig.3 B). Confocal images also revealed STAT6 immunolocalization within the nuclei of BAEC after 60 min of VEGF stimulation (Fig.2 D), whereas the nuclei of unstimulated control cells were negative (Fig. 2 C). STAT6 was first identified as a key player in the interleukin (IL)-4 signaling pathway in lymphoid cells (33Hou J. Schindler U. Henzel W.J. Ho T.C. Brasseur M. McKnight S.L. Science. 1994; 265: 1701-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of theSTAT6 gene showed that this transcription factor plays a role in cell responses to IL-12, IL-4, and IL-13 (30Levy D.E. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1559-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that STAT6 also plays a role in regulating cellular responses stimulated by PDGF (34Patel B.K. Wang L.M. Lee C.C. Taylor W.G. Pierce J.H. LaRochelle W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22175-22182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). STAT6 has been indirectly implicated in regulating angiogenic responses because it binds to enhancer sequences found in the prolactin gene (18Decker T. Kovarik P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Members of the prolactin/growth hormone family have been shown to possess pro-angiogenic activity. Interestingly, the 16-kDa N-terminal fragments of the latter proteins have been shown to possess anti-angiogenic activity (35Struman I. Bentzien F. Lee H. Mainfroid V. D'Angelo G. Goffin V. Weiner R.I. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, STAT6 may play a role in regulating endothelial cell growth responses because of its effects on prolactin family proteins. Further work is needed to test this hypothesis. In our experiments, STAT1 and STAT6 displayed different activation time courses in response to VEGF stimulation, with STAT1 activation occurring before that of STAT6. It will be of interest to evaluate whether this difference corresponds to diverse activation mechanisms and whether VEGF-induced STAT6 activation in aortic endothelial cells depends upon STAT1 activity. The VEGF-induced STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation pattern is represented in Fig. 4. Immunoreactivity specific for phosphotyrosine-STAT3 is detected in immunoblotted cell lysates after only 60 and 90 min of VEGF stimulation. Western blotting of BAEC nuclear extracts showed occasional weak activity, but no significant nuclear translocation was observed. Confocal immunocytochemistry failed to detect immunoreactivity specific for STAT3 in the nuclear compartment of VEGF-stimulated BAEC. After 90 min of VEGF induction, the confocal images showed STAT3 immunoreactivity only in the perinuclear region (Fig. 2 F). Neither longer nor shorter exposures to VEGF resulted in STAT3 nuclear translocation. Therefore, it appears that VEGF does not induce the STAT3 nuclear translocation that is required for its transcriptional activity. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs has been shown to be necessary but not sufficient for their transcriptional ability, which also requires their nuclear translocation. This latter event is an active process for which the specific mechanisms remain unclear. Because STAT proteins lack a nuclear localization signal, it has been suggested that chaperone proteins are required to assist their active translocation into the nuclear compartment (36Johnson H.M. Torres B.A. Green M.M. Szente B.E. Siler K.I. Larkin 3rd, J. Subramaniam P.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 244: 607-614Google Scholar). Thus, differences between STAT protein interactions with chaperone proteins may contribute to differences in their intracellular compartmentalization. Previous work has indicated that STATs can have other functions in addition to their actions as transcription factors within the nucleus. For example, STAT3 has been found to serve as an adaptor protein to couple phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) to the IFNAR1 chain of the type I IFN receptor (37Lawrence M. Pfeffer J.E. Mullersman S.R. Pfeffer A.M. Wei S. Chuan H.Y. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Activation of the PI3 kinase pathway is known to be involved in the survival-promoting function of VEGF. Thus, molecular interactions between STAT3 and PI3 kinase may be important in the regulation of endothelial cell survival. Experiments are underway to test this possibility. Experiments in progress show that STAT3 co-precipitates with PI3 kinase following VEGF stimulation, suggesting a role for STAT3 in coupling PI3 kinase to the VEGF signaling pathway. When we analyzed STAT5 tyrosine phosphorylation, we found that unlike STAT1, -3, and -6, STAT5 was not tyrosine-phosphorylated or nuclear translocated in response to VEGF stimulation. As has been accentuated by extensive experimental evidence, VEGFR1 and -2 possess distinct biological activities. To identify which receptor is involved in STAT activation, we next examined the activation pattern of the different STATs in BAEC treated with 25 ng/ml PlGF. PlGF at this concentration is able to bind exclusively to the VEGF receptor, VEGFR1. Under our experimental conditions, PlGF failed to activate the phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3, or STAT6, suggesting that activation of the STAT pathway is specifically mediated by VEGFR2. The STAT signaling pathway is classically known as the JAK/STAT pathway because STAT activation is often associated with and dependent upon the tyrosine phosphorylation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases belonging to the Janus kinase (JAK) family. JAK1, JAK2, Tyk2, and JAK3 have been shown to phosphorylate STAT proteins (38Yeh T.C. Pellegrini S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1523-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Our results show that BAEC only express JAK1 and Tyk2 proteins and that these kinases are not tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to VEGF. Recent reports have shown that Src kinases and the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of growth factor receptors can also phosphorylate the tyrosine residues of the various STAT proteins (39Liang H. Venema V.J. Wang X. Ju H. Venema R.C. Marrero M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19846-19851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 40Paukku K. Valgeirsdottir S. Saharinen P. Bergman M. Heldin C.-H. Silvennoinen O. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because VEGFRs possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments to see whether STAT1 also interacts with VEGFR2. We focused our attention on STAT1 because its phosphorylation time course corresponded closely with that of VEGFR2. To assay for VEGFR2 mediation of STAT1 activation, we performed co-immunoprecipitation studies using precipitating antibodies directed against VEGFR2 and immunoblotting the precipitated proteins with anti-STAT1 antibodies. As shown in Fig.5 A, after 15 min of VEGF treatment, STAT1 co-precipitated with VEGFR2. These results suggest that, upon interaction with its ligand, VEGFR2 associates with STAT1. Furthermore, pretreatment of BAEC with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein inhibited STAT1 association with VEGFR2 (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that VEGFR2·STAT1 complex formation requires tyrosine phosphorylation. These results, along with our observations that JAK1 and Tyk2 are not activated in response to VEGF stimulation of BAEC, suggest that the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of VEGFR2 might be involved in STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Given the well established role of VEGFR2 in signaling the effects of VEGF in promoting endothelial cell growth and survival, these data support a role for STAT1 activation in these processes. A recent report provides additional evidence that the activity of endothelial cell-specific tyrosine kinase receptors is associated with the STAT pathway (41Korpelainen E.I. Karkakkainen M. Gunji Y. Vikkula M. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The authors found that over-expression of VEGFR1, -2, and -3, as well as Tie-1 and Tie-2 in 293T cells, results in the activation of co-expressed STAT5 and STAT3 but not STAT1. STAT1 activation was seen only for a mutant form of the Tie-2 receptor (MTie-2), which has been associated with venous malformation. Similar results were obtained analyzing STAT transcriptional activity in VEGF-stimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In contrast, our results indicate that STAT1 and STAT6 are activated in response to VEGF in primary cultures of aortic endothelial cells. It is likely that the different experimental approaches and different cell types involve different regulatory mechanisms associated with the VEGF signaling pathway."

Except for the γ-subunit that specifically associates with the α-subunit, none of these proteins, however, have been shown to associate with other proteins. Here we report the identification of a new member of this family, termed phospholemman-like protein from shark (PLMS) since it has substantial homology to PLM, is about the same molecular mass, and is a substrate for both PKA and PKC. It is also homologous to the γ-subunit and like this, it associates specifically with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit. Our in vitro results indicate that phosphorylation of PLMS by PKC dissociates it from the α-subunit, causing Na,K-ATPase activation. In this study we address the question whether PKC regulation of Na,K-ATPase is mainly mediated not only by direct phosphorylation of the α-subunit itself, but rather via phosphorylation of PLMS in a mechanism resembling the phospholamban (PLB) regulation of the Ca-ATPase. The catalytic subunit of PKA was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). l-α-Phosphatidylserine was obtained from Avanti (Alabaster, AL). Dioleoyl-1,2-sn-glycerol was from Sigma. Purified PKC from rat brain was from CalBiochem (La Jolla, CA). [32P]ATP, protein A-Sepharose, and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All other chemicals were of the highest analytical grade available. Na,K-ATPase from shark rectal glands and pig kidney was purified, solubilized, and reconstituted as described previously (17Cornelius F. Logvinenko N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The specific hydrolytic activities measured at 23 °C were 10.5 and 8 units/mg for membrane-bound shark rectal and pig renal enzyme, respectively. The specific activity of solubilized shark enzyme was 11 units/mg at 23 °C. PKA phosphorylation was performed in a mixture containing; 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 4 μg of protein, and 2 milliunits of PKA. PKC phosphorylation was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing: 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.02 mm phosphatidylserine, 0.01 mm dioleoyl-1,2-sn-glycerol, 0.1 mmATP (Tris salt), 4 μg of protein, and 0.13 μg of PKC. For PKC phosphorylation in mixed micelles, the mixture contained the same ligands plus 8 μg of C12E8. The phosphorylation reaction for both kinases was initiated by the addition of 100 μm ATP containing 2 μCi of [32P]ATP, proceeded for 30 min at 24 °C, and then terminated by the addition of 16 μl of sample buffer (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). The hydrolytic activity of membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase in the presence of nonsolubilizing concentrations of C12E8 and after PKC phosphorylation was measured by preincubating the Na,K-ATPase (4 μg) with C12E8 (values indicated in figure legends) for 5 min on ice in a typical PKC phosphorylation mixture followed by a further incubation for 30 min at 24 °C in the presence or absence of PKC, as described above. The hydrolytic activity was subsequently measured by addition of 20 μl of this mixture to 500 μl of ATPase test medium containing; 30 mm histidine, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.03 μCi [32P]ATP, 0.06% bovine serum albumin, plus Na+, K+, and ATP concentrations as indicated in figure legends. The 32P liberated from [32P]ATP was measured as described previously (19Lindberg O. Ernster L. Methods Biochem. Anal. 1956; 3: 1-12Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP added during PKC phosphorylation was almost completely hydrolyzed during the 30-min incubation; this and the subsequent 25 times dilution in the ATPase test medium ensured that the [ATP] in the test medium was not affected. The phosphorylated proteins were separated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, 3% stacking gel, 9% intermediate gel, and 16% resolving gel). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, destained and dried, then analyzed by autoradiography. The bands corresponding to the α-subunit were excised from the gel and the phosphorylation stoichiometry calculated from the measured radioactivity and the calculated content of Na,K-ATPase α-subunit (17Cornelius F. Logvinenko N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To detect oligomeric structures of membrane proteins, we used the detergent perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFO). The PFO-PAGE was performed essentially as described in Ref. 20Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.-J. Garmai E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar. For immunoblotting, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, washed three times for 20 min with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 20 °C. The membranes were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG for 2 h. After washing, proteins were detected by ECL reagents. Immunoprecipitation was performed by ligation of the α-subunit to protein A through C-terminal specific α- antibody (C1002–1016, kindly provided by J. V. Møller). About 500 μl of protein A-Sepharose was prewashed five times with the immunoprecipitation buffer containing; 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 40 mm methionine, 0.04% Na2-azide, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After prewashing, the protein A-Sepharose beads were suspended in 300 μl of the immunoprecipitation buffer. About 20 μg of32P-labeled, PKA-phosphorylated Na,K-ATPase was added and the mixture incubated for 30 min at 24 °C with head-over-head shaking. The antibody (100 μl) was added and the mixture incubated for further 30 min. The mixture was then washed five times with RIPA buffer (650 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 1% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4) to remove nonspecific binding. Finally, the protein A-Sepharose beads were suspended in 200 μl of sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, then 30 μl was loaded onto 14% Laemmli gel (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). A control was run in parallel in which the anti-α serum was replaced by serum not reacting with proteins from shark preparations (non-immune rabbit serum). In coimmunoprecipitation experiments using pig kidney α-subunit, 40 μg of purified membrane-bound pig kidney enzyme was incubated with about 10 μg of the 15-kDa shark protein purified by electroelution as described below. Both α- and β-antibodies are used for immunoprecipitation of pig α, and a non-immune rabbit serum was used as control. The β antibody (β1, 59–70) was a gift of J. V. Møller. Horizontal first-dimensional focusing was performed according to Görg et al. (21Görg A. Postel W. Günther S. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) using immobilized pH gradients from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Re-hydration of the immobilized pH gradients strips was performed in a solution containing 8 m urea, 2% CHAPS, 2% immobilized pH gradients buffer (pH 3–10NL), 0.3% dithiothreitol. Approximately 80 μg of protein was included in the re-hydration solution and loaded to the immobilized pH gradients strip in a re-swelling tray. Vertical second-dimension gels were run in equipment designed as described by Celis et al. (22Celis J.E. Ratz G. Basse B. Lauridsen J.B. Celis A. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, New York1994: 222-230Google Scholar). Silver staining was carried out as described in Ref. 23Tunón P. Johansson K.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 9: 171-179Google Scholar. Polyvinylidene difluoride strips containing the 15-kDa protein were excised and analyzed by N-terminal Edman degradation. The analysis was performed at the Protein Structure Core Facility, University of Nebraska Medical Center with an Applied Biosystems Procise sequencer. In two separate experiments initial yields were 7.8 and 2.9 pmol. The primary sequence of the N-terminal 30 amino acids was obtained. Membrane fragments were resolved using 15% Laemmli gels and the bands corresponding to the 15-kDa protein excised. The protein in the SDS gel strips was extracted using a Bio-Rad system as described in Ref. 24Celis J.E. Ratz G. Basse B. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 4. Academic Press, New York1998: 404-406Google Scholar. The extracted protein was concentrated using Centricon tubes (3 kDa cut off). Protein determination was as described (25Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The regulation of Na,K-ATPase transport activity by PKC phosphorylation exhibits different characteristics among different cell types as well as in purified preparations (for review, see Ref. 4Middleton J.P. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1996; 22: 293-302PubMed Google Scholar). The latter observations could be accounted for by the presence of ancillary proteins important for mediating the PKC effects in Na,K-ATPase enriched preparations, which are removed to various extents during purification. Therefore, the effects of PKC in different enzyme preparations and in preparations purified to different degrees (membrane-bound enzyme and solubilized enzyme from shark rectal glands) were compared and correlated with their protein patterns using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Fig.1 demonstrates that several low molecular weight proteins co-purifying with Na,K-ATPase-enriched membranes are removed to a significant degree following solubilization of Na,K-ATPase with the non-ionic detergent C12E8. Solubilization resulted in the removal of about 30% (w/w) of insoluble proteins that were separated by centrifugation.Figure 9Effects of C12E8 in the presence or absence of PKC on the Na + and K + activation of shark Na,K-ATPase. Panel A shows the Na+ activation in the absence of K+. The curves are fits of the Hill equation to the data with the following fit parameters: control,n H = 1.7 ± 0.1 andK 0.5 = 2.5 ± 0.2 mm; PKC phosphorylated: n H = 1.7 ± 0.1 andK 0.5 = 2.5 ± 0.2 mm; and C12E8 (20 μm) treated:n H = 1.4 ± 0.1 andK 0.5 = 2.9 ± 0.3 mm.Panel B shows the Na,K-ATPase activity of shark enzyme measured as a function of [K+] in the presence of either 20 μm C12E8 (○) or C12E8 plus PKC-phosphorylation (⋄) compared with control enzyme (■). The reaction medium contained 100 mm Na+ and 10 μm ATP. The intercept at [K+] = 0 mm represents the Na-ATPase activity. The curves are nonlinear regression analysis of the data with a Hill equation (sigmoidal dose-response curves) with the following Hill number, n H andK 0.5 values: 1.7 ± 0.2 and 0.26 ± 0.02 mm for untreated enzyme, 1.8 ± 0.4 and 0.24 ± 0.03 mm for PKC-phosphorylated enzyme, and 1.6 ± 0.1 and 0.23 ± 0.02 mm for C12E8-treated enzyme.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 7Effects of PKC phosphorylation and nonsolubilizing C12E8 on the ATP-substrate curve of shark Na,K-ATPase. Relative Na,K-ATPase activity of membrane-bound shark Na,K-ATPase as a function of increasing ATP concentrations was measured in controls (○) and enzyme treated with 30 μm (■) and 60 μmC12E8 (▿), or after PKC phosphorylation in the absence of detergent (Δ). The reaction medium contained 130 mm NaCl and 20 mm KCl. The curvesare best fits to the data using a two-site binding equation with the following low affinity K 0.5 values: 41 ± 8 μm (control), 54 ± 5 μm (30 μm C12E8), 54 ± 6 μm (60 μm C12E8), and 68 ± 14 μm (PKC). TheK 0.5 values in the presence of detergent or after PKC phosphorylation differed insignificantly from the control. The relative maximal Na,K-ATPase activities were: 1.34 ± 0.04 (30 μm C12E8), 1.67 ± 0.07 (60 μm C12E8), and 1.34 ± 0.09 (PKC) that were all significantly higher than the control (1.00). As indicated by the Eadie plots in the inset, the ATP-substrate curves are biphasic with a major low affinity and a minor high affinity ATP effect. However, less than 10% of total activity was stimulated at high affinity ATP and fitting parameters for this fraction is not included. Reaction conditions were as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Two-dimensional gel analysis of shark Na,K-ATPase preparations. Membrane-bound (A) and solubilized (B) shark Na,K-ATPase preparations were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Several low molecular weight proteins that were co-purified with membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase are removed after selective solubilization of Na,K-ATPase by C12E8 (indicated by arrows inpanel A). Protein determination indicated that about 70% (w/w) of the total protein in membrane fragments was solubilized, whereas 30% was separated by centrifugation. The Na,K-ATPase α- and β-subunits are detected by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. The β-subunits are recognized as multiple spots at about 53 kDa probably representing different modifications (glycosylations) of the protein. Bracketed spots are recognized by the PLM antibody and signify PLMS. As indicated by panel B the amount of PLMS is significantly decreased after solubilization. Molecular weight and pI are indicated on the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig.2 shows autoradiograms of PKC-phosphorylated membrane-bound (lane 1) and solubilized (lane 2) Na,K-ATPase. In both preparations the α-subunit was phosphorylated to low stoichiometries (<0.1 mol of Pi/mol of α), as found previously in other species, except for the rat (3Feschenko M.S. Sweadner K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14072-14077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). PKC phosphorylation of the shark Na,K-ATPase preparations revealed the existence of several low molecular weight phosphoproteins migrating as bands with apparent molecular mass in the range 35–15 kDa, including a heavily phosphorylated 15-kDa band, showing that in addition to the α-subunit several proteins in the preparation are targets for PKC. The bands migrating at molecular mass of about 80 kDa (labeled PKC) and 50 kDa correspond to autophosphorylated PKC holoenzyme and its catalytic subunit, respectively (26Nakadate T. Jeng A.Y. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11507-11513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PKC phosphorylation of the low molecular weight proteins was abolished or significantly reduced after solubilization of the membrane fragments (lane 2). The 15-kDa protein was also observed in autoradigrams after phosphorylation by PKA both in membrane preparations and, with less intensity, after solubilization (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and6, respectively). As seen from Fig. 2, lane 7,this 15-kDa protein is completely absent in pig kidney Na,K-ATPase preparations. The absence of a PKC-phosphorylated 15-kDa protein band in the autoradiograms of solubilized Na,K-ATPase (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3) suggested that solubilization either removed this component from the Na,K-ATPase preparation, or specifically inhibited its PKC phosphorylation, or both. Controls in which PKC phosphorylation of solubilized Na,K-ATPase was performed without separation of insoluble proteins demonstrated that phosphorylation of the 15-kDa band by PKC was specifically abolished by C12E8 (Fig. 2, lane 3). To test if PKC phosphorylation of this protein is dependent on its membrane association, Na,K-ATPase solubilized by C12E8was incorporated into liposomes by complete removal of the detergent (17Cornelius F. Logvinenko N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) followed by phosphorylation by PKC. As seen from Fig. 2,lane 4, the 15-kDa protein is phosphorylated by PKC after detergent removal, indicating that detergent inhibition of PKC phosphorylation of this protein was reversible. Finally, in membrane-bound Na,K-ATPase phosphorylated by PKC in the presence of increasing concentrations of C12E8it was found that PKC phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein was abolished at a detergent/protein ratio of about 1.5, at a C12E8 concentration of ∼200 μm(Fig. 3, upper panel). By measuring the scattered light at 220 nm the solubilization of shark rectal membrane fragments was followed at increasing C12E8 concentrations, performed in identical PKC phosphorylation medium without PKC. As indicated by the decrease in light scattering, membrane solubilization was found to take place at an identical detergent/protein ratio of 1.45 that abolished PKC phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein (Fig. 3, lower panel). Taken together these results demonstrated that phosphorylation of the 15-kDa protein by PKC is dependent on its membrane association in contrast to its phosphorylation by PKA (see above). N-terminal sequencing of the 15-kDa band indicated the presence of only one protein with the partial sequence shown in Fig. 4. Comparison of the partial sequence by BLAST scanning against protein data bases revealed that the protein is novel and has a substantial homology to 13 other sequences. The closest homology (about 33% identity) was to PLM (13Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L., R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) which has a similar mobility on SDS-PAGE of 15 kDa and to the Na,K-ATPase γ-subunit with mobility of 8–11 kDa. PLM has a highly basic C-terminal sequence with phosphorylation motifs for one PKA and three PKC phosphorylation sites (13Palmer C.J. Scott B.T. Jones L., R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11126-11130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This C-terminal sequence is absent in the γ-subunit. Due to the close homology to PLM this protein was termed PLMS. These proteins belong to a family of small hydrophobic proteins with a conserved signature pattern (DNS)XFXYDX(2)(ST)(LIVM)(RQ)X(2)G (27Chen L.-S.K. Lo C.F. Numann R. Cuddy M. Genomics. 1997; 41: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This family of proteins has a single transmembrane domain and has been suggested to form ion channels (9Minor N.T. Sha Q. Nichols C.G. Mercer R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6521-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), or serve as channel regulators (mammary tumor, Mat-8 (16Morrison B.W.

The partial sequence of PLMS includes a region highly homologous to PLM that represents in part a transmembrane domain. An antibody raised against the TYDY motif of phospholemman (kindly provided by L. R. Jones) reacted with PLMS, and recognized two spots at pI of 8–9 in the two-dimensional gels (thebracketed spots in (Fig. 1). That PLMS specifically associated with shark Na,K-ATPase α-subunit was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation using a C-terminal specific antibody to the α-subunit (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3). From reactions with isoform-specific antibodies (kindly provided by T. A. Pressley) the main α-isoform of shark Na,K-ATPase was found to be α3 in accordance with previous findings (30Hansen O. Pflügers Arch. 1999; 437: 517-522PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PLMS electroeluted from SDS gels and incubated with pig kidney Na,K-ATPase preparations, that lack a 15-kDa phospholemman-like protein, also coimmunoprecipitated with pig renal α1-subunit (Fig. 5 lanes 4 and5) indicating that PLMS associated with at least two different α-isoforms. Further indications of the specific association of the two proteins came from protein determination of the amount of α-subunit and PLMS extracted from SDS gels. Here a stoichiometry of 1.1 mol PLMS/mol of α was calculated using a molecular mass of 112 kDa for the α-subunit and assuming a molecular mass of 8.4 kDa for PLMS, the same as found for PLM. This indicated stoichiometric expression of the Na,K-ATPase and PLMS. The fact that PLMS specifically associates with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit and is phosphorylated by protein kinases could indicate that it is a component of the protein kinase regulation of Na,K-ATPase. The ability of C12E8 to dissociate PLMS from the shark Na,K-ATPase membrane preparations was investigated by measuring PLMS recovered in the pellet after incubation of the membranes with increasing concentrations of C12E8 followed by centrifugation. As seen in Fig.6 A, dissociation of PLMS from the Na,K-ATPase membranes is evident at a C12E8concentration of 80 μm, a concentration lower than needed for complete membrane solubilization (∼200 μm, cf. Fig. 3). In order to test if PKC phosphorylation of PLMS affects its binding to the α-subunit of shark Na,K-ATPase, as shown above for nonsolubilizing concentrations of C12E8, the effects of PKC phosphorylation on the binding of PLMS to the α-subunit was investigated. Untreated and PKC-phosphorylated membrane-bound shark Na,K-ATPase were incubated with anti-α antibody linked to Protein A-Sepharose beads. After extensive wash with RIPA buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”) the two preparations were resolved by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted, and probed with the anti-TYDY antibody to detect PLMS. As seen from Fig. 6 B the fraction of PLMS associated with the Na,K-ATPase α-subunit was substantially decreased after PKC phosphorylation. PKC phosphorylation and nonsolubilizing concentrations of C12E8 thus seem to act in parallel both inducing dissociation of the PLMS·α-subunit mem"

Potential ligands for galectin-3 include lysosomal-associated membrane proteins 1 and 2, IgE, laminin, and Mac−2-binding protein (37Inohara H. Raz A. Biochem.

Mucin derived from human colon cancer cells has been recently identified as an important ligand for galectin-3, and may represent a major circulating ligand in colon cancer patients (39Bresalier R.S. Byrd J.C. Wang L. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4354-4357PubMed Google Scholar). Galectin-3 may be phosphorylated at N−terminal Ser6(major) and Ser12 (minor) (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R.

Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that phosphorylation may modulate the intracellular function and translocation of galectin−3, but the functional role of phosphorylation in determining interactions of this endogenous lectin with its ligands remains to be determined (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study employs large-scale separation of galectin-3 and its phosphorylated species to examine the effect of phosphorylation on the binding of galectin-3 to two of its reported ligands, laminin (38Ochieng J. Gerald M. Raz A. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1992; 186: 1674-1680Google Scholar) and purified colon cancer mucin (39Bresalier R.S. Byrd J.C. Wang L. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4354-4357PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reduced saturation binding to each ligand by greater than 85%, and ligand binding could be fully restored by dephosphorylation with protein phosphatase type 1. Metabolic labeling confirmed the presence of phosphorylated galectin-3in vivo in the cytosol of human colon cancer cells from which ligand mucin was purified. Carrier-free [32P]orthophosphoric acid (5 mCi/ml in water, 9000 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (10 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). Rat recombinant casein kinase I (500,000 units/ml), and rabbit recombinant protein phosphatase 1 (1000 units/ml) were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Rat hybridoma M3/38 producing monoclonal antibody (TIB−166, IgG2a) against galectin-3 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Rabbit polyclonal anti-galectin-3 antibodies (R1) were generated as described previously (42Nangia-Makker P. Thompson E. Hogein C. Ochieng J. Raz A. Int J Oncol. 1995; 7: 1012-1079Google Scholar). Both antibodies were purified with an Immunopure (G) kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Horseradish peroxidase−conjugated anti-rat and anti-rabbit antibodies and rat myeloma immunoglobulins were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Biotinylated anti−rat and anti-rabbit F(ab)2 fragments, protein G-agarose, blocking reagent, and protease inhibitor mixture were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). Human recombinant galectin-3 and the Ser6 → Glu (SG-6) mutant were produced as described previously (36Gong H.C. Honjo Y. Nangia-Makker P. Hogan V. Mazurek N. Bresalier R.S. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6239-6245PubMed Google Scholar). Asialomucin from human colon cancer cell line LS LIM6 was prepared as described previously (39Bresalier R.S. Byrd J.C. Wang L. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4354-4357PubMed Google Scholar). Laminin from the basement membrane of the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma laminin, phosphatase inhibitors, and all other reagents, unless specified, were purchased from Sigma. Colon cancer cell lines LS174T, LSLIM6, and HM7 were cultured as described previously (22Bresalier R.S. Mazurek N. Sternberg L.R. Byrd J.C. Yunker C.K. Nangia-Makker P. Raz A. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For32P labeling in vivo, cells were grown in 162-cm2 flasks (Costar, Cambridge, MA) to confluence. Metabolic labeling and cell lysis was performed according to the procedure described by Huflejt et al. (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) 32P-Labeled galectin-3 was immunoprecipitated from labeled cell lysates with TIB166 antibodies as described previously (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As controls, isotype matched normal rat myeloma immunoglobulins were used (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). The immunoprecipitates were boiled for 5 min in reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)1sample buffer and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (22Bresalier R.S.

Proteins were identified by either Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblots with R1 antibodies followed by drying and autoradiography. The casein kinase I−catalyzed incorporation of 32P into human recombinant galectin-3 was carried out as described (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modification. The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm[γ-32P]ATP to a final specific activity of 20 mCi/mmol, 500 units of rat recombinant casein kinase I, and 20–40 μg of affinity purified recombinant galectin−3 in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by addition of reduced SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The sample was boiled for 5 min and separated on a 10% polyacrylamide SDS gel and either visualized by Coomassie Blue staining or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for immunoblotting with TIB166 antibodies followed by autoradiography. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio−Rad Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and the Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For protein separation the mini-protein unit (Bio-Rad) was used under standard conditions. For isoelectric focusing the IEF Ready Gel, pH 3–10, and IEF cathode and anode buffers (Bio-Rad) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions for nondenatured protein samples. Western analysis was performed as described previously (22Bresalier R.S. Mazurek N. Sternberg L.R. Byrd J.C. Yunker C.K. Nangia-Makker P. Raz A. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). After separation, protein was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes in 0.7% acetic acid, blotted with anti-galectin-3 mAb TIB166, and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). Radiolabeled protein was detected by autoradiography. The relative amount of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated galectin-3 was estimated by densitometric scoring using a digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The radioactivity incorporated into the phosphorylated galectin-3 excised protein band was determined by using a β-counter (Packard, Downer Grove, IL). For purification of phosphorylated galectin-3 (galectin-3-P), the casein kinase I phosphorylation reaction was scaled up. Affinity purified galectin-3 (280 μg) was phosphorylated as above, except that 3500 units of casein kinase I and 34 mCi/mmol [32P]ATP were used in a final volume of 350 μl. The reaction was carried out for 20 h at 30 °C, and terminated by addition of β−mercaptoethanol (5 mm final) and glycerol (10% final). The reaction mixture was immediately separated on an IEF gel pH 3–10. The galectin-3-P protein band was visualized by autoradiography. The non-phosphorylated galectin-3 was identified on a control lane by staining with IEF staining solution (Bio-Rad). Both galectin-3-P and nonphosphorylated galectin-3 bands were excised and eluted with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.6, and 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 2 h. The separated proteins were concentrated on a Speed-Vac to 100 μl and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, at 4 °C for 12 h. PP1 is a Mn2+-dependent protein phosphatase with activity toward phosphoserine/threonine residues.(43Zhang A.J. Bai G. Deans-Zirottu S. Browner M.F. Lee E.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Galectin-3-P was digested with 1 unit of PP1 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% Brij 35 for 2 h at 30 °C. The individual wells of a 96-well polystyrene microtiter plate (Costar) were coated with either Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma laminin or asialomucin at 1 μg/100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline/well at 4 °C overnight. The nonspecific protein-binding sites were saturated with 1% blocking buffer made in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Serial dilutions of gel eluted galectin-3, galectin-3-P, SG-6 mutant galectin-3, and dephosphorylated galectin-3 samples in 0.5% blocking buffer were then added to the coated wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Control experiments contained 0.3 m lactose. The wells were next incubated with rabbit anti-human galectin-3 antibodies (R1), diluted 1:3000 in 0.5% blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by incubation with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab)2 fragment (1:4000) for 30 min at 37 °C. In the last incubation step, ABC reagent (Vectastain ABC Kit, Vector, Burlingame, CA) was added for 30 min at 24 °C. The protein-coated wells were developed with the ABTS substrate and developed color monitored at 405 nm using a plate reader (Bio-Rad). Galectin-3 has been previously reported to be anin vitro substrate for casein kinase I (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat recombinant casein kinase I was therefore used to phosphorylate affinity purified human galectin-3. Phosphorylated galectin-3 was characterized by a slight decrease in electrophoretic mobility on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, while retaining immunological recognition by both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to galectin-3 (Fig.1). Upon isoelectric focusing, two major bands with distinct pI values resolved at pI 8.2 and pI 7.6 with32P radioactivity associated with the more acidic band (Fig. 2). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that the two bands were immunoreactive with antibody to galectin-3. This demonstrated the feasibility of separating galectin-3 into its more acidic phosphorylated form and its nonphosphorylated form for further experiments. Phosphogalectin was then purified using a “scaled up” phosphorylated reaction described under “Experimental Procedures.” After separation by isoelectric focusing, bands representing phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated galectin-3 species were excised and eluted by diffusion in ammonium bicarbonate. Products were then analyzed by Western analysis. Galectin-3 and galectin-3-P were purified to homogeneity from the reaction mixture (Fig.3 A) and all radioactivity was found to be associated with galectin-3-P (Fig. 3 B).Figure 2Isoelectric focusing of nondenatured galectin-3 phosphorylation mixture. The phosphorylation reaction mixture was run on an IEF pH 3–10 gel to equilibrium (100 volts/2.5 h).

Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of phosphorylation of galectin-3 on binding to two of its characterized ligands, laminin and colon cancer mucin. Ligand binding was quantitated for native protein, galectin-3-P and after dephosphorylation of galectin-3-P with the serine-threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase type 1 (Fig. 4). Galectin-3 bound both ligands in a dose-dependent manner with half-maximal binding at 1.5 μg/ml (Fig.5). This binding was sugar dependent as it was abrogated by 0.3 m lactose. Galectin-3-P exhibited markedly reduced binding, with saturation reaching only 15% at galectin-3 saturation binding levels for both ligands. Dephosphorylation of galectin-3-P fully restored galectin-3-ligand binding, confirming the role of phosphorylation in diminishing binding of galectin-3 to its ligands.Figure 5Saturation binding of galectin-3 and phosphorylated galectin-3 to immobilized asialomucin (A) and laminin (B). Serial dilutions of galectin-3 (○, ⋄), phosphorylated galectin−3 (●), galectin-3-P dephosphorylated with protein phosphatase type I (▪), and galectin-3 mutated (Ser6 → Glu) at serine 6 (SG-6 mutant, ▵, ▴) in the presence (⋄, ▴) or absence (○, ●, ▪, ▵) of 0.3 m lactose were added to microtiter wells coated with mucin or Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm sarcoma laminin in a solid phase binding assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Bars, S.E. of quadruple analyses.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been previously demonstrated (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that galectin-3 is predominantly phosphorylated on Ser6. Control phosphorylation reactions were performed with purified galectin-3 mutated at this site (Ser6 → Glu) (36Gong H.C. Honjo Y. Nangia-Makker P. Hogan V. Mazurek N. Bresalier R.S. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6239-6245PubMed Google Scholar). Mutated galectin-3 purified from this source bound its ligands to a similar or increased degree compared with native galectin-3 (Fig. 5). These results confirm that the reduced ability of galectin-3-P to bind its ligands is not simply the result of the purification procedure or the phosphorylation reaction per se. Colon cancer mucin is an important ligand for galectin-3, and interactions between the endogenous lectin and this ligand is altered by phosphorylation (Fig. 5). While phosphorylated galectin-3 has been demonstrated in cells such as 3T3 fibroblasts (31Frigeri L.G. Zuberi R.I. Liu F.-T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7644-7649Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 41Cowles E.A. Agrawal N. Anderson R.L. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured polarized canine kidney cells (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it has not been detected in normal or neoplastic human cells including those from colon cancer. Human colon cancer cells were, therefore, metabolically labeled with32P as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cell extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-galectin-3 mAb TIB166. Phosphorylated galectin-3 was detected in all three colon cancer lines studied, and the amount of phosphorylated galectin-3 correlated with metastatic potential (22Bresalier R.S. Mazurek N. Sternberg L.R. Byrd J.C. Yunker C.K. Nangia-Makker P. Raz A. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) (Fig.6 A). Greater than 90% of phosphorylated galectin-3 was associated with the cytosol, and no galectin-3 could be detected in the nuclear fraction (not shown). In order to further document the expression of phosphorylated galectin-3 in these cells, proteins from total cellular homogenates of human colon cancer cells were separated by isoelectric focusing, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and galectin-3 and galectin-3-P visualized by immunoblotting (Fig. 6 B). Results from these experiments mirrored those obtained by metabolic labeling. Galectin-3 and phosphorylated galectin-3 were again detected in cellular homogenates from colon cancer cells, and the amount of galectin-3-P varied between cell lines. Galectin-3-P represented approximately 8% of total galectin-3 in colon cancer cell line LS174T (8.3%, 8.4%,n = 2), but greater than 20% of total galectin-3 in cell lines LSLIM6 (26.3%, 29.8%) and HM7 (22.6%, 29.6%). The β-galactoside-binding protein galectin-3 plays a central role in a variety of biological functions including cellular recognition and adhesion (20Inohara H. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3267-3271PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kuwabara I. Liu F.-T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3939-3944PubMed Google Scholar), regulation of apoptosis (17Akahami S. Nangia-Makker P. Inohara H. Kim H.C. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5272-5276PubMed Google Scholar), and pre-mRNA splicing (18Dagher S.F. Wang J.L. Patterson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). This endogenous lectin is found at elevated levels in a wide variety of neoplastic cell types, and is involved in tumorigenicity and cell metastasis in vivo (18, 19, 22,44–46), at least in part by promoting adhesive interactions (22Bresalier R.S.

Galectin-3 acts as a receptor for ligands containing poly−N−acetyllactosamine (Galβ4GlcNacβ3Galβ4GlcNAc) sequences, but how galectin-3-ligand recognition and interactions are regulated remains to be determined. Binding to at least some ligands is associated with positive cooperativity determined by repetitive sequences within the N−terminal domain (47Morsa S.M. Cooper D.N.W. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation is important in modulating a variety of cell processes including cell growth and differentiation, and plays a major role in signal transduction pathways (48Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 49Hunter T.

It has recently become apparent that the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of certain adhesion molecules may play a role in modulation of cell signaling (47Morsa S.M. Cooper D.N.W. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar,48Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). E-selectin, for example, is constitutively phosphorylated in cytokine-activated human endothelial cells and undergoes enzymatically regulated dephosphorylation following leukocyte adhesion (47Morsa S.M. Cooper D.N.W. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 has been shown to be phosphorylated, predominantly at N-terminal Ser6, and both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms have been found in 3T3 fibroblasts and polarized canine kidney epithelial (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells (26Hamann K.K. Cowles E.A. Wand J.L. Anderson R.L. Exp Cell Res. 1991; 196: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17706-17712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylated galectin-3 has been detected in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of 3T3 fibroblasts, and the ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated galectin-3 varies with the proliferative status of the cells. The precise functions of phosphorylated galectin-3 and the role of phosphorylation in determining the interactions of galectin-3 with its ligands remains unknown. Phosphorylation does not appear to play a role in regulating cellular localization of the lectin (36Gong H.C. Honjo Y. Nangia-Makker P. Hogan V. Mazurek N. Bresalier R.S. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6239-6245PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we confirmed that galectin-3 is a substrate for casein kinase I, and demonstrated that phosphorylation is associated with an alteration in molecular weight and electrophoretic mobility suggesting the possibility of a conformational shift induced by phosphorylation. We took advantage of the ability to separate phosphorylated galectin-3 from nonphosphorylated protein by isoelectric focusing to separate sufficient amounts of each species for comparative functional studies. Phosphorylation reduced saturation binding of galectin-3 to laminin and mucin by greater than 85%. This was not a result of protein denaturation during in vitro phosphorylation since galectin-3 mutated at Ser6 bound in a manner similar to native galectin-3. A growing body of evidence suggests that protein phosphatases may play a role in modulating cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesion (48Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 365-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated the ability of the protein serine-threonine phosphatase protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (51Bollen M. Stalmans W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 27: 227-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) to dephosphorylate galectin-3-P in vitro. Dephosphorylation fully restored binding of galectin-3 to its ligands. It is possible that galectin-3 is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo by casein kinase-I, and that the ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated protein is regulated by phosphatase activity (40Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been proposed for regulation of selectin phosphorylation and leukocyte adhesion to endothelia (50Yoshida M. Szente B.E. Kiely J.M. Rosenzweig A. Aimbsone M.A.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 158: 933-941Google Scholar). Galectin-3 expression correlates with neoplastic transformation and tumor progression in the colon (22Bresalier R.S. Mazurek N. Sternberg L.R. Byrd J.C.

Up−regulation of galectin-3 in colon cancer cells by stable transfection leads to an increase in spontaneous metastasis and liver colonization, while down-regulation by antisense methodology significantly reduces metastasis (22Bresalier R.S.

This may be due in part to alterations in cellular adhesive interactions. Phosphorylated galectin-3 was detected in the cytosol of the colon cancer cells from which ligand mucin was purified, and was most abundant in cells with high metastatic potential. We have recently demonstrated that mucin produced by colon cancer cells is an important ligand for galectin-3 (39Bresalier R.S. Byrd J.C. Wang L. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4354-4357PubMed Google Scholar), and that galectin-3 may actually play a role in regulation of mucin synthesis (53Dudas S.P. Yunker C.K. Sternberg L.R. Bresalier R.S. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: A273Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Our data suggest that phosphorylation of galectin-3 may play a role in regulation of these processes. Phosphorylation of galectin-3 significantly alters the interaction of galectin-3 with its ligands. The process by which phosphorylation acts as an “on-off switch” for protein-carbohydrate interactions is unknown, but has important implications for understanding the biological functions of this protein. Galectin-3 is unique among galectins in that in addition to a typical carbohydrate recognition domain (located at the C-terminal), it has an unrelated non-carbohydrate-binding N-terminal domain including a 12-amino acid leader sequence containing a casein kinase I serine phosphorylation site (36Gong H.C. Honjo Y. Nangia-Makker P. Hogan V. Mazurek N. Bresalier R.S. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 6239-6245PubMed Google Scholar). The x−ray crystal structure of the carbohydrate recognition domain of galectin-3 has been determined (54Seetharaman J. Kanigsberg A. Slaaby R. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13047-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and indicated structural differences between galectin-3 and other galectins which may impact carbohydrate binding specificity. The region corresponding to the dimer interface in galectin-1 and galectin-2 does not, for example, appear to serve a similar role in galectin-3, and oligomerization of galectin-3 may instead depend on interactions between the carbohydrate recognition domain and the N-terminal. While the three-dimensional structure of the N terminus of galectin-3 is not yet known, it appears that it is intact galectin-3, but not the carbohydrate recognition domain alone, which shows avidity for multivalent glycoconjugates (55Hsu D.K.

Phosphorylation of Ser6 at the N terminus of galectin-3 could lead to a conformational change in the protein, altering its ability to participate in multivalent interactions necessary for its biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2326537533,"Breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 has been implicated in the control of gene regulation and such regulated genes are thought to mediate the biological role of BRCA1. Overexpression of BRCA1 induces GADD45, a p53-regulated and stress-inducible gene. However, the molecular mechanism by which BRCA1 induces the expression GADD45 remains unclear. In this report, we have shown that the GADD45 promoter is strongly activated following expression of wild-type BRCA1. In contrast, both the tumor-derived BRCA1 mutants (p1749R and Y1853insA) and truncated BRCA1 mutant protein (Delta500 - 1863 BRCA1), which lack transactivation activity, were unable to activate the GADD45 promoter, indicating that the BRCA1-mediated activation of the GADD45 promoter requires normal transcriptional properties of BRCA1. BRCA1 did not induce the c-Jun and c-fos promoters, which rules out a general effect of BRCA1 on other immediate-responsive genes. Expression of the human papillomavirus E6 and the dominant-negative mutant p53 proteins had no effect on the induction of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1, suggesting that activation of the GADD45 promoter by BRCA1 is independent of cellular p53 function. With the 5'-deletion analysis, the BRCA1-responsive element of the GADD45 promoter was mapped at the region from -121 to -75. Disruption of this region resulted in the abrogation of BRCA1 activation of the GADD45 promoter. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the mechanism by which BRCA1 induces GADD45 is mainly through the transactivation of the GADD45 promoter, further demonstrating the evidence that GADD45 acts as one of the BRCA1-regulated genes.

CmPS-1 was purified to near homogeneity from C. maxima (pumpkin) phloem exudate and, based on microsequence analysis, the cDNA encoding CmPS-1 was cloned. The association rate constant (k a) of phloem-purified and recombinant His6-tagged CmPS-1 for elastase was 3.5 ± 1.6 × 105 and 2.7 ± 0.4 × 105m−1 s−1, respectively. The fraction of complex-forming CmPS-1, Xinh, was estimated at 79%. CmPS-1 displayed no detectable inhibitory properties against chymotrypsin, trypsin, or thrombin.

Plant Growth Regul. 1998; 25: 123-126Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) implicated this long-distance transport pathway in the delivery of signaling molecules. Recent studies provided new insights into the nature of the information molecules being transported from mature leaves, via the phloem, to distant plant organs. Irrefutable evidence has been obtained for the translocation of certain proteins (6Fisher D.B. Wu Y. Ku M.S.B.

In addition, it has also been demonstrated that specific RNA molecules are present in the phloem sap (10Kühn C. Franceschi V.R. Schulz A. Lemoine R. Frommer W.B.

Given the importance of this nutrient/information delivery system to the functioning of the plant, it was axiomatic that plants had to evolve mechanisms to protect the operational integrity of the phloem. Maintenance of structural integrity required the development of systems able to rapidly respond to physical damage, imposed either by environmental forces or herbivory; the sealing of disrupted sieve tubes involves deposition of material at the level of the sieve plate pore (1Zimmermann H.M. Milburn J.A. Pirson A. Zimmermann M.H. Encyclopedia of Plant Physiology, New Series: Transport in Plants I. Phloem Transport. 1. Springer, New York1975Google Scholar). In the enucleate sieve tube system of angiosperms, maintenance of membrane integrity has also been transferred to the neighboring companion cells and likely involves the delivery of essential constituents via plasmodesmata (6Fisher D.B. Wu Y. Ku M.S.B. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 1433-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Balachandran S. Xiang Y. Schobert C. Thompson G.A. Lucas W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To ensure the integrity of the signaling components, the plant needs also to protect against protein and RNA degradation occurring within the phloem sap. This capacity appears to have been achieved through the development of a control system that regulates the plasmodesmal-mediated exchange of macromolecules between companion cells and the sieve tube system (9Xoconostle-Cázares B.

Girousse G. Bonnemain J.-L. Delrot S. Bonnemain J.-L. Delrot S. Dainty J. Lucas W.J. Recent Advances in Phloem Transport and Assimilate Compartmentation. Ouest Editions, Nantes, France1991: 64-73Google Scholar) within the phloem sap is consistent with this model. A range of small molecular weight proteinase inhibitors (PIs1; 3–10 kDa) has also been isolated from the phloem sap of several species (16Murray C. Christeller J.T. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Habu Y. Fukushima H. Sakata Y. Abe H. Funada R. Plant Mol.

Although nothing is known concerning the mechanism(s) by which these PIs enter the sieve tube system and their role remains conjectural, they likely serve to protect the proteins within the phloem sap against the action of endogenous proteinases. An important challenge to the integrity of the phloem system is also posed by piercing-sucking insects, whose primary nutrition is gained through uncontrolled access to the phloem sap. In this regard, it is of interest to note that numerous plant PIs have been shown to modify plant-arthropod interactions, via their role as digestibility reducers, toxins, or modifiers of feeding behavior (19Broadway R.M.

In addition, in vitro assays have established that phloem PIs (3–10 kDa) are able to inhibit a wide range of proteinases (18Christeller J.T. Farley P.C. Ramsay R.J. Sullivan P.A. Laing W.A. Eur. J.

In the present study, we report on the molecular, biochemical, and functional characterization of Cucurbita maxima phloemserpin-1 (CmPS-1), a 42-kDa serine PI present in theC. maxima (pumpkin) phloem translocation stream. Biochemical studies revealed that CmPS-1 represents a novel plant serpin having anti-elastase properties. A close correlation was established between the developmentally regulated increase in CmPS-1 within the phloem sap and the reduced ability of the piercing-sucking aphids, Myzus persicae to survive and reproduce on C. maxima. However, in vitro feeding experiments using highly purified phloem-derived CmPS-1 failed to demonstrate a direct effect on aphid survival. C. maxima Duch. cv. Big Max (pumpkin) plants were grown in an insect-free greenhouse under natural daylight conditions (14-h photoperiod). Light intensities at mid-day ranged from 1200 to 1500 μmol m−2s−1 and day/night temperatures were 26 ± 3/22 ± 2 °C, respectively. Phloem exudate (sap) from cut stems of 4-week-old pumpkin plants was collected, dialyzed, and stored as described previously (13Balachandran S. Xiang Y. Schobert C. Thompson G.A. Lucas W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14150-14155Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Phloem sap proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and those at the 40-kDa range were excised from gels, electroeluted, and concentrated by partial lyophilization. This protein concentrate was digested overnight with lysyl endopeptidase (EC 3.4.21.50; Wako, Richmond, CA) and the resultant products separated by high pressure liquid chromatography on a 25-cm-long C18 column. Peptides were eluted, and a major peak was sequenced (model 477A, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For cloning of CmPS-1, stem poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 4-week-old pumpkin plants was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA by reverse transcription (FastTrack 2.0 kit; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA); this cDNA was then used as template for PCR. The following degenerate primers were employed: forward, 5′-TICCITAYWSICARGGICCNGA-3′ (I = deoxyinosine, n= A + C + T + G, Y = C + T, S = C + G, W = A + T); and reverse, 5′-TCIGTICCYTCYTCRTTNACYTC-3′. The resultant 342-bp DNA fragment was labeled with 32P nucleotides by random priming (high prime DNA labeling kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then used to screen a pumpkin stem cDNA library. This library was constructed in Uni-ZAP XR (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the above described poly(A)+ RNA to synthesize double-stranded cDNA (ZAP synthesis kit, Stratagene). Plaques (105) were screened, and five positive clones were excised into phagemids. Each putative CmPS-1 clone was then sequenced in both directions. Editing, analysis, and sequence alignments were performed using the SeqEd1.03, SeqVu1.0.1, DNASIS-Mac v2.0, DNA Strider1.2 programs and GAP, FASTA, and BLAST search engines from the Genetics Computer Group (Wisconsin sequence analysis package). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C, and chromatography was performed using fast protein liquid chromatography. Purification was followed by Western analysis with polyclonal antibodies (R306, raised against serpin Z-type proteins from barley seed (25Dahl S.W. Rasmussen S.K. Hejgaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25083-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by Dr. Jøern Hejgaard, Dept. of Biochemistry and Nutrition, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby). Phloem exudate collected as described above was dialyzed overnight against buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After clarification by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 30 min), the exudate was applied to HiTrap Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer A. CmPS-1 did not bind to the column and thus was collected from the flow-through fractions. These fractions were dialyzed against buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol), clarified (as described above), and loaded onto HiTrap SP-Sepharose equilibrated with buffer B. CmPS-1 was present in the flow-through fractions. A second cation exchange chromatography fractionation was performed in the presence of a lower pH buffer to fractionate CmPS-1. The flow-through fractions were dialyzed against buffer C (30 mm MES, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA) and subjected to HiTrap SP equilibrated with buffer C. CmPS-1 was eluted at 120 mm NaCl using a linear gradient. The fractions containing CmPS-1 were pooled, supplemented to 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, and subsequently loaded onto a HiTrap phenyl-Sepharose column. CmPS-1 was eluted using a reverse gradient. Fractions of the highest purity, as judged by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl. Dialyzed proteins were concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centricon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. The expression vector used to produce recombinant, His6-tagged CmPS-1 was derived from pET-15b, and the Escherichia colihost was BL21(DE3)pLysS (26Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). To construct the expression vector, pET-15b/CmPS-1, the CmPS-1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using 5′ primer, 5′-GCGGATCCAATGGA-CATCAAAGAAGCAATCAG-3′ and 3′ primer, 5′-GCGGATCCTCAATCCACAAGAGGG-TTTAACACCTG3′.BamHI sites (underlined) were included to facilitate the cloning procedures. A PCR-amplified fragment was digested withBamHI and ligated into pET-15b, previously digested withBamHI, and dephosphorylated. After transformation, the orientation of the insert was verified by restriction enzyme analysis and the integrity of the cloning by sequencing. To express His6-tagged CmPS-1, transformed BL21(DE3)pLysS harboring pET-15b/CmPS-1 was grown overnight at 37 °C in Luria broth from a single colony, which was subsequently used as the primary culture. The secondary culture was initiated with a 1/500 dilution of primary culture in 750 ml of M9TB media (26Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar) at 37 °C and continued until it reached 0.8 A 600. The culture was then cooled in a 16 °C water bath and expression induced, overnight, with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in 50 ml of B-PER solution (Pierce) supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl and 20 μg/ml DNase I. Cell lysis (15 min at room temperature) was followed by centrifugation (27,000 × g for 30 min), and the supernatant was batch-incubated with Ni-agarose (His·Bind resin, Novagen, Madison, WI) charged previously with 50 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.5 mNaCl, and 5 mm imidazole. The resin was washed extensively with equilibration buffer followed by a second wash with 30 mm imidazole in equilibration buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with 400 mm imidazole and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 1 mm EDTA. Proteins were further purified by loading onto HiTrap Q-Sepharose. His6-tagged CmPS-1 was present in the flow-through fractions, which were pooled, dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 100 mm NaCl, and stored at 4 °C. To measure proteinase inhibitory activity, 10 μl (0.5 pmol) of stock solution of each serine proteinase substrate was incubated at 24 °C for 0.25–15 min with 10 μl of an equimolar amount of CmPS-1 in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 20. After incubation, 80 μl of 0.5 mm chromogenic substrate solution was added, and residual proteinase activities were monitored by detecting the time-dependent change in absorbance at 405 nm. Proteinases and substrates (Sigma) used in these assays were as follows: porcine pancreatic elastase andN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-p-nitroanilide; porcine pancreatic trypsin andN-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide; bovine pancreatic α-chymotrypsin andN-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide; human plasma thrombin andN-p-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide. Association rate constants were determined according to the scheme described by Dahl et al.(25Dahl S.W. Rasmussen S.K. Hejgaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25083-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Active site titration was carried out as described by Jiang and Kanost (27Jiang H. Kanost M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1082-1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Trypsin was titrated first by usingp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) (28Chase T. Shaw E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1967; 29: 508-514Google Scholar), and this was then used to titrate α-1-antitrypsin (Calbiochem). This α-1-antitrypsin was subsequently used as a secondary standard to titrate elastase and chymotrypsin. Titrated elastase was then used to titrate CmPS-1 and His6-tagged CmPS-1. Serpin-proteinase complexes were formed by incubating 50 pmol of CmPS-1 with 50 pmol of proteinases at 24 °C for 5 min in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, and 100 mmNaCl. The reactions were stopped by the addition of hot SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the mixture was then subjected to Tricine-SDS-PAGE using a 10–20% gradient gel (Novex, San Diego, CA). After blotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the amino-terminal residues of the cleaved 4-kDa peptide were determined by sequencing analysis. Alternatively, the 4-kDa peptide fragment was first extracted from the gel using a combination of 50% acetonitrile plus 5% formic acid followed by 70% isopropanol plus 5% formic acid. The molecular weight of the pooled extracts was then determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry on a Biflex III (Bruker, Billerica, MA). Theoretical values for the molecular weight of the peptide were calculated using the PeptideMass program. After fractionation by SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with rabbit anti-serpin polyclonal antibodies (R306) (25Dahl S.W. Rasmussen S.K. Hejgaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25083-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). For visualization, either chemiluminescence (Renaissance, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or color development (nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP)) was employed. CmPS-1 levels present in the phloem sap were determined by quantitative Western analysis in which purified recombinant CmPS-1 was used as the standard. The aphid speciesM. persicae was used in feeding studies. As a cucurbit-adapted control, Aphis gossypii was raised onCucurbita pepo L. (squash) and employed in parallel feeding experiments. Aphid isolates were collected locally and maintained in cages within a greenhouse (16 h light:8 h dark at 27 °C); M. persicae was reared on Rhaphanus sativus L. (radish). The in vivo influence of CmPS-1 and plant age on aphid survival were investigated by placing M. persicae andA. gossypii on newly expanded leaves of 10-, 14-, 21-, 27-, 35-, and 42-day-old pumpkin plants. Aphids were confined to the feeding surface (second- through fifth-order veins) using clip cages mounted on the abaxial leaf surface, with 50 individuals in each cage and two cages per plant. After 3 days, aphid survival and fecundity (nymphs produced per adult) were recorded, and then phloem sap was collected from the petiole of the treated leaf. Each experiment was performed on five plants, and experiments were repeated in triplicate. The level of CmPS-1 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis. For in vitro aphid feeding experiments, 10 neonate M. persicae (aphids less than 12 h old) were placed in a sterile 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube, which was then covered with a thin layer of Parafilm®. A 20-μl drop of feeding solution was then placed onto the Parafilm® surface and immediately covered by an additional layer of Parafilm®, forming a feeding sachet. The feeding solution was composed of 20% sucrose supplemented with each protein being tested. Aphid survival was recorded at 24-h intervals for 3 days. The enzymatic activity of each treated protein, maintained under feeding conditions within control sachets, was tested to confirm protein stability under these experimental conditions. Each feeding experiment was repeated at least 10 times. SDS-PAGE analysis performed on phloem exudates collected from different aged C. maxima plants revealed the presence of a developmentally regulated 40-kDa protein; the level of other phloem proteins appeared more or less invariant with plant age (Fig.1 A). For further study, this protein was subjected to internal microsequencing after lysyl endopeptidase digestion. A protein data base search, using the resultant 20-amino acid peptide sequence, VLALPYSQGPDPRRFSMYFF, identified homologous regions within the serpin superfamily of serine PIs (see Ref. 25Dahl S.W. Rasmussen S.K. Hejgaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25083-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar and references therein). Degenerate PCR primers, based on the internal peptide sequence LPYSQGPD and a sequence within plant serpins, EVNEEGTE (29Brandt A. Svendsen I. Hejgaard J. Eur. J.

This PCR product was cloned and sequenced and was confirmed to contain the expected internal peptide sequence, PRRFSMYFF. A pumpkin stem cDNA library was then used to obtain a full-length (1363 bp) clone, CmPS-1, encoding a 389-amino acid polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 42.8 kDa. In the deduced CmPS-1 open reading frame, amino acid residues 221–240 precisely matched the microsequenced peptide fragment (Fig.2, dashed line). During the cDNA library screening, a second gene (1470 bp),CmPS-2, was cloned, and the encoded polypeptide (389 amino acid residues) was found to have 72% identity to CmPS-1. However, the internal microsequence obtained from the 40-kDa phloem sap protein failed to match any region within the predicted CmPS-2 open reading frame. In addition, immunological analyses revealed that CmPS-2 was undetectable in phloem exudate (data not shown). Collectively, these results suggested that CmPS-2 is not a phloem sap protein. Characterization of this protein will be presented elsewhere.Figure 2Sequence alignment of the deduced CmPS-1 polypeptide and homology with other members of the serpin superfamily.

Biol. 1996; 30: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and a putative serpin, AtSLP (52%; Arabidopsis thaliana data base, GenBankTM accession numberAAD23667). Alignments with mammalian and insect members of the serpin superfamily, including human α-1-antichymotrypsin (HsACT), α-1-antitrypsin (HsA1AT), and Manduca sexta alaserpin (MsALA) showed overall amino acid sequence identities in the 25 to 30% range (50% similarity; Fig. 2). CmPS-1 contains the carboxyl-terminal active site loop, which represents the signature for the serpin family of serine PIs. The P1-P1′ bond is located within this consensus loop (Fig. 2, horizontal line). Confirmation of the relatedness between CmPS-1 and the serpins present in barley and wheat seeds was obtained through Western analysis. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a barley serpin (25Dahl S.W. Rasmussen S.K. Hejgaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25083-25088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) cross-reacted with CmPS-1 present in phloem sap collected from C. maximaplants (Fig. 1 B) and confirmed the developmental up-regulation of CmPS-1. An additional, but much weaker, immunoreactive band was also detected at the 70-kDa region; the level of this protein remained constant over the developmental period examined (data not shown). Biochemical studies of native proteins obtained from the phloem sap of plants are rare, largely because of the difficulty in collecting sufficient amounts of sap to permit biochemical purification. In this regard, cucurbits represent an excellent system because they allow the efficient collection of large amounts of exudate. To purify CmPS-1 from phloem sap, dialyzed exudate was subjected to a series of chromatographic steps (Fig.3 A). Anion followed by cation exchange chromatography (at pH 7.0) was used to separate CmPS-1 from phloem protein 1 (PP1; 96 kDa) and phloem protein 2 (PP2; 24 kDa), the two major constituents of the C. maxima phloem sap. As a result of Q-Sepharose chromatography, a number of minor proteins were retained in the anion exchange column (data not shown), whereas most proteins, including CmPS-1, PP1, and PP2, were present in the flow-through fraction (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 1and 2). The SP-Sepharose cation exchange chromatographic step, carried out at pH 7.0, removed PP1, PP2, and a number of additional proteins from the CmPS-1 fraction (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). A second cation exchange fractionation, carried out at pH 5.5, removed the remaining high molecular weight proteins; CmPS-1 was eluted using a salt gradient (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). Finally, phenyl-Sepharose with reverse gradient was used to purify CmPS-1 to near homogeneity (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). Western analysis confirmed the identity of the protein preparation (Fig. 3 C), and the purity of CmPS-1 was confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Special attention was taken to separate CmPS-1 from low molecular weight proteins because the phloem sap contains a number of small (3–10 kDa) PIs (16Murray C. Christeller J.T. Biol. Chem.

Production of IP6 predominately occurs through phosphorylation of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (IP5) by a 2-kinase. Recent cloning of the gene encoding this kinase fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae, designated scIpk1, has identified a cellular role for IP6 production in the regulation of mRNA export from the nucleus. In this report, we characterize the biochemical and functional parameters of recombinant scIpk1. Purified recombinant scIpk1 kinase activity is highly selective for IP5 substrate and exhibits apparent K mvalues of 644 nm and 62.8 μm for IP5 and ATP, respectively. The observed apparent catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) of scIpk1 is 31,610 s−1m−1. A sequence similarity search was used to identify an IP5 2-kinase from the fission yeastSchizosaccharomyces pombe. Recombinant spIpk1 has similar substrate selectivity and catalytic efficiency to its budding yeast counterpart, despite sharing only 24% sequence identity. Cells lackingsc-IPK1 are deficient in IP6 production and exhibit lethality in combination with a gle1 mutant allele. Both of these phenotypes are complemented by expression of thespIPK1 gene in the sc-ipk1 cells. Analysis of several inactive mutants and multiple sequence alignment of scIpk1, spIpk1, and a putative Candida albicans Ipk1 have identified residues involved in catalysis. This includes two conserved motifs: E(i/l/m)KPKWL(t/y) and LXMTLRDV(t/g)(l/c)(f/y)I. Our data suggest that the mechanism for IP6 production is conserved across species.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 225-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 2Berridge M. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). A major route for synthesis of IPs is through activation of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. Phospholipase C cleaves lipids such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, a regulator of calcium efflux from the endoplasmic reticulum. The release of a soluble inositol head group from its anchoring lipid also represents the first step in the pathway for generation of more highly phosphorylated inositols (3Shears S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The most abundant of these is inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (IP6), also known as phytate. IP6 can represent up to 1% of the mass of a plant seed, where it may serve as an antioxidant and a phosphate storage source (4Drobak B. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 697-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Biswas S. Biswas B.B. Subcell. Biochem. 1996; 26: 287-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The role of IP6 is less clear in mammalian cells, although there is evidence suggesting that it may regulate inflammation, neurotransmission, and cell growth (reviewed in Ref. 3Shears S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Recently, a metabolic pathway converting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to IP6 was delineated in budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae cells (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It has been shown that IP6 also serves as a precursor for diphosphorylated inositols, such as diphosphoryl inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (PP-IP5), in both yeast and vertebrate cells (3Shears S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 10Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Combined in vivo and in vitro studies show that three genes (PLC1,IPK1, and IPK2/ARG82) account for the pathway converting phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to IP6. Ipk2 is a dual-specificity inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 6-kinase and inositol-1,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate (IP4) 3-kinase (7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Ipk1 is an IP5 2-kinase (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Physiological roles for soluble IPs in at least two nuclear functions have been established: mRNA export and transcription. Mutant alleles of plc1,ipk1, and ipk2 were all identified in a synthetic lethal genetic screen with a temperature-sensitivegle1-2 mutant defective for an essential mRNA export factor (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 11Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Moreover, the plc1, ipk1, and ipk2 mutants each individually have mRNA export defects at a restrictive growth temperature (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). These mutants do not show defects in nuclear envelope morphology, nuclear protein import, or protein export (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PLC1 in cells suppresses the temperature sensitivity of thegle1-4 mutant in a manner that depends on a functional IP5 2-kinase (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). 2A. R. Odom and J. D. York, unpublished data. Taken together, these results suggest a direct role for this IP pathway, specifically IP6 production, in either stimulating or regulating mRNA export. Interestingly, Ipk2 is identical to Arg82, a regulator of the ArgR·Mcm1 transcription complex (7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12Messenguy F. Dubois E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2586-2592Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Dubois E. Messenguy F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ipk2 may control transcriptional responses by at least two mechanisms. First, the Ipk2 protein itself, but not IP generation, is necessary for assembly of ArgR·Mcm1 complexes on DNA promoter elements (7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Second, the production of IP4/IP5 through both phospholipase C and Ipk2 kinase activities is required for proper execution of ArgR·Mcm1-mediated gene expression (7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). In this way, complexes may be poised on DNA awaiting activation of inositol signaling for direct regulation of gene expression. Subcellular localization of Ipk2 in the nucleus and Ipk1 in the nucleus and at the nuclear envelope further suggests that these enzymes constitute a nuclear signaling pathway (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Besides S. cerevisiae, IP5 2-kinase activities from other organisms have been also been characterized (summarized in Refs. 3Shears S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 49-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar and 14Ongusaha P. Hughes P. Davey J. Mitchell R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, Ipk1 from S. cerevisiae, designated scIpk1, represents the first to be characterized at the molecular level (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The 281-residue polypeptide sequence of scIpk1 does not show detectable similarity to other IP kinases. To further understand the structure and function of IP5 2-kinases, we report the biochemical and functional characterization of scIpk1 and the identification of an IP5 2-kinase from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Our studies have defined key residues important for catalysis and demonstrate that the budding and fission Ipk1 yeast proteins are functionally interchangeable despite sharing minimal sequence similarity. Overall, Ipk1 may represent a prototypic member of a new class of IP kinase. Yeast strains were grown either in 1% yeast extract and 2% peptone or in synthetic minimal medium plus appropriate amino acids supplemented with 2% glucose. Yeast transformations were completed by the lithium acetate method (15Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J.

Russell, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) using 4 ng/μl sense and antisense primers (5′-atgcatgcagaattcgTTATATCGAATCCGCTTTTTAAATCC-3′ and 5′-atgcatgcagtcgaccTTACTTTATGCTGCTCCGGCATG3-′, respectively; uppercase letters denote spIpk1 coding sequence) with Taqpolymerase and manufacturer's buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reactions were cycled 30 times under the following conditions: denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min. The resulting product was digested with EcoRI and SalI, gel-purified, and inserted into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T. The regions generated by PCR were sequenced to confirm the product. The sequences of the oligonucleotides for cloningspIPK1-C were based on a candidate S. pombeIP5 2-kinase (283-residue partial-length gene product; GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number D89240). The candidate was identified by sequence comparison of the primary amino acid sequence of scIpk1 with the GenBankTM/EBI non-redundant data base (November 1998 release) using the gapped BLASTP program (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60228) Google Scholar). The plasmids harboring GST fusion proteins of the fivesc-ipk1 mutant alleles were generated as follows. Thesc-ipk1 mutant strains were isolated from a synthetic lethal screen with a gle1-2 mutant (Table I) (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was prepared from wild-type and mutant cells for use as a PCR template using 4 ng/μl sense and antisense oligonucleotides (5′-GCACATGTAGAATTCCATATGCAAGTCATCGGACGTGGTGGGGCA-3′ and 5′-GCACATGTACGTCGACCTGCCAGTACCAAAGGTGGAAAG-3′, respectively). To generate IPK1 fragments, KlenTaq or Taqpolymerase was used with the respective manufacturer's buffer (Sigma and Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The reactions were conducted using a decremental annealing temperature program for 25 total cycles with denaturing at 96 °C for 1 min, annealing over a range from 59 to 49 °C (decreasing by 0.4 °C/cycle) for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by 10 additional cycles at 48 °C annealing. The resulting product was purified and digested withEcoRI and SalI and inserted into theEcoRI and SalI sites of pGEX-4T. The integrity of this and all other constructs was verified by DNA sequencing using the ABI Prism dGTP BigDye Terminator Ready Reaction kit (PE BioSystems). The GST expression plasmids for each of the sc-ipk1 alleles were as follows: sc-ipk1-1, pSW1283;sc-ipk1-2, pSW1284;sc-ipk1-3, pSW1292;sc-ipk1-4, and pSW1285;sc-ipk1-5, pSW1287. In the course of constructing the pGST-scIpk1 plasmid, a construct with a PCR mutation was isolated and further characterized (pSW1288). The mutation results in a change of the codon AAT for Asn10 to GAT for Asp, designatedsc-ipk1-6. All proteins were expressed in DH5α. For large-scale purifications, 1-liter cultures of bacteria in LB medium were allowed to grow at 37 °C toA 600 = 0.6. Fusion protein expression was induced by addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (final concentration), and growth was continued for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 8 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After incubation on ice for 15 min, the cells were disrupted by sonication. The lysate was clarified by a 10,000 × gspin for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with a 1-ml bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h (with agitation). The beads were washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer and eluted in glutathione buffer (10 mm glutathione, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 50 mm NaCl.). For small-scale purifications, 50-ml cultures of cells were grown in LB medium and induced for 3 h as described above. The cells were collected, resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 15 min, and disrupted by sonication. Lysates were clarified by a 13,000 × g spin for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 3 ml of lysis buffer and eluted in glutathione buffer. The radiolabeled [32P]IP5 substrate was made by incubating 125 pmol of unlabeled pure IP4 (Matreya, Inc., Pleasant Gap, PA) with 3 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP and 9 ng of GST-Ipk2 (7Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) in a total volume of 25 μl of buffer containing 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA for 1 h at 37 °C. The [32P]IP5 product was purified by HPLC (as described below) and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5). Enzymatic activity was measured using [32P]IP5. For kinetic analysis, standard reactions were conducted in a total volume of 10 μl. Purified GST fusion proteins were diluted in buffer containing 50 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mmKCl, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and added in a 2-μl volume to an 8-μl reaction mixture of 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, ATP, and IP5. Individual kinetic parameters for scIpk1 were determined by varying the concentration of ATP (0.02–5 mm) while holding IP5 constant (20 μm). Alternatively, IP5 was varied (0.125–32 μm) while holding ATP constant (5 mm). Parameters for spIpk1-C were determined using a range of IP5 concentrations from 0.5 to 32 μm and a range of ATP concentrations from 0 to 400 μm. The amounts of recombinant protein added to individual assays and the time of incubation at 30 °C were varied to maintain substrate conversion within a linear range (5–50% conversion). The reactions were stopped by addition of 2 μl of TLC running buffer (1.08 m KH2PO4, 0.64m K2HPO4, and 1.84 mHCl). The samples were spotted onto Baker-flex polyethyleneimine cellulose thin-layer chromatography sheets (J. T. Baker Inc.) and allowed to dry. Separation of IP5 and IP6 by TLC was achieved by incubation of the sheet in a tank of TLC running buffer for ∼45 min. Sheets were air-dried, and the radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For theLEU2/CEN plasmid with scIPK1 under the control of the GLE1 promoter (pSW898), sequence encoding scIpk1 residues 2–281 was made by PCR amplification of a library plasmid harboring scIPK1 (pSW832) using 4 ng/μl sense and antisense oligonucleotides (5′-AGATCCCATGGAGTCATCGGACGTGGTGGG-3′ and 5′-ACCAGTCGACGAAAGAAAAGTATACAG-3′, respectively) with KlenTaq polymerase and manufacturer's buffer (Sigma). The reactions were cycled 30 times under the following conditions: denaturing at 96 °C for 30 s, annealing at 48 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1.5 min. The 875-base pair product was digested withNcoI and SalI, gel-purified, and inserted into the NcoI and SalI sites of pSW747 (19Watkins J.L. Murphy R. Emtage J.L.T. Wente S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6779-6784Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This resulted in the sequence encoding full-length scIpk1 fused in frame to the sequence encoding the first 6 amino acid residues of Gle1. ThespIPK1/LEU2/CEN expression construct (pSW1255) was generated by ligating the EcoRI/SalI fragment from the GST-spIpk1 construct into the NcoI andSalI sites of pSW747 with the linker oligonucleotides 5′-CATGGGAGGTGGAG-3′ and 5′-AATTCTCCACCTCC-3′. TheGLE1/LEU2/CEN expression plasmid was described previously (pSW406) (11Murphy R. Wente S.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), as was the LEU2/CEN vector (pRS315) (20Sikorski R.S. Heiter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The IP profile of yeast strains was determined as described previously (6York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 21Stolz L.E. Kuo W.T. Longchamps J. Sekhon M.K. York J.D. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were grown in complete synthetic medium containing 40 μCi/ml [3H]inositol to late logarithmic phase. Approximately 3 × 107 cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 μl of 0.5 n HCl. Soluble IPs were extracted by adding 372 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) and 100 μg of glass beads. The mixture was aggressively agitated for 2 min, followed by addition of 125 μl of chloroform and 125 μl of 2 m potassium chloride and another 2 min of agitation. The lysates were clarified by a 13,000 × gspin for 5 min, and the supernatant was recovered. Samples were analyzed by HPLC, with the IPs resolved by a Partisphere strong-anion exchange column (4.6 × 125 mm) and a linear gradient from 10 mm to 1.7 m ammonium phosphate (pH 3.5) over 25 min, followed by elution for 45 min with 1.7 m ammonium phosphate. To characterize the biosynthesis of IP6 by scIpk1, kinetic experiments were performed with bacterially expressed and purified GST-scIpk1. The ability of the enzyme to synthesize IP6 was assayed by incubation with [32P]IP5 and ATP in a buffered system. The reaction products were analyzed by polyethyleneimine cellulose thin-layer chromatography, which readily resolved IP5 and IP6 isomers (Fig.1 A). No IP6 was formed at time 0 incubation, in the absence of ATP, in the absence of GST-scIpk1, or in the presence of the stopping buffer. Reactions were determined to be dose- and time-dependent (Fig.1 A; data not shown). The optimal pH range, temperature, and MgCl2 concentrations were determined under zero-order conditions to be pH 6.7–7.5, 30 °C (89% maximal activity was observed at 37 °C), and 10 mm, respectively (data not shown). Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters for GST-scIpk1 were determined by monitoring the conversion of IP5 to IP6 under a variety of conditions. Data from three experiments are shown as saturation curves with specific activity (micromoles of IP6 formed per min/mg of protein) plottedversus the IP5 substrate concentration (Fig.1 B). Apparent kinetic parameters were calculated from the best fit line derived from double-reciprocal plots of 1/v versus 1/S (shown in the inset).The average apparent K m and V max for IP5 were found to be 644 nm and 0.020 μmol/min/mg, respectively, using 40 ng of recombinant protein and 5 mm ATP. This corresponds to an apparent catalytic efficiency (K cat/K m) of 31,610 s−1m−1. Similar experiments were performed with constant GST-scIpk1 and IP5 levels (80 ng and 20 μm, respectively) and varying concentrations of ATP (0.020 to 5 mm). Data from the experiments are shown in Fig. 1 C. The apparent K m for ATP was determined to be 62.8 μm. To determine whether homologues of scIpk1 were present in the available sequence data bases, we conducted a series of searches with the gapped BLASTP program (18Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60228) Google Scholar). Computer analysis identified putative proteins from S. pombe (GenBank™/EBI accession number CAB60684.1) and C. albicans (Stanford DNA Sequencing and Technology Center accession number Contig5-2849) with high probability scores (Fig. 2). The C-terminal region of the S. pombe protein (residues 375–640) has 24% identity and 53% similarity to full-length scIpk1. Based on the subsequent characterization described below, this protein has been designated spIpk1. The sequence in the C. albicansdatabase represents a candidate IP5 2-kinase (designated caIpk1). The 361-amino acid residue sequence from C. albicans completely overlaps with the sequences for scIpk1 and the C-terminal region of spIpk1. The three sequences share ∼24% identity in all pairwise comparisons. The pairwise alignments (data not shown) and an overall alignment (Fig. 2 B) of the sequences for the three proteins showed two short regions of high identity, designated Boxes A and B. The Box A regions correspond to amino acids 123–131 of scIpk1, residues 491–498 of spIpk1, and residues 138–145 of putative caIpk1. The Box B regions include residues 224–235 of scIpk1, residues 557–588 of spIpk1, and residues 250–261 of putative caIpk1. The consensus sequence for each motif was deduced as E(i/l/m)KPKWL(t/y) for Box A and as LXMTLRDV(t/g)(l/c)(f/y)I for Box B. Interestingly, the N-terminal region of spIpk1 is not present in scIpk1 or putative caIpk1. The open reading frame for spIpk1 encodes a predicted 640-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of ∼73 kDa. This compares with 281 residues and ∼33 kDa for scIpk1 and 361 residues and ∼43 kDa for putative caIpk1. A search of the S. cerevisiae data base by BLASTP Version 2.0 with the spIpk1 sequence revealed that a span in the N-terminal region of spIpk1 is related to scRvs161 and the N-terminal region of scRvs167 (Fig.2 A). The scRvs161 and scRvs167 proteins may play roles in endocytosis, actin function, and cell signaling (23Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol.

As an initial attempt to define the structural basis of HCN channel gating, we have characterized the functional roles of the charged residues in the S2, S3, and S4 transmembrane domains.

Recently, the genes that encode pacemaker channels were cloned from the mammalian brain (2Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R.

The cloned pacemaker channels are collectively referred to ashyperpolarization-activated, cyclicnucleotide-gated (HCN)1 channels (5Biel M. Ludwig A. Zong X. Hofmann F. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

HCN channel subunits have an overall structure similar to voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel subunits, including six transmembrane domains (S1–S6), a similar selectivity filter sequence containing the GYG motif, multiple basic residues in the S4 domain, and a few conserved acidic residues in the S2 and S3 domains. However, unlike Kv channels, HCN channels only open upon hyperpolarization and are permeable to both K+ and Na+ (2Santoro B. Liu D.T. Yao H. Bartsch D. Kandel E.R. Siegelbaum S.A. Tibbs G.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 3Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M.

The mechanism and structural basis of the gating behavior of HCN channels is unknown but has been the subject of considerable speculation (6Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,7Santoro B. Tibbs G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 741-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). There are two alternative hypotheses to explain the gating of HCN channels. Channel opening in response to membrane hyperpolarization could be due to recovery of channels from an inactivated state. A competing hypothesis is that hyperpolarization-dependent channel opening represents activation from a normal closed state. In this model, the gating scheme for HCN channels is a mirror image of Kv channel gating. However, no experimental data using HCN channels exists to support either hypothesis. Indirect evidence in favor of the first hypothesis comes from the behavior of a mutant Shaker K+channel. Introduction of three point mutations into the S4 domain of Shaker (R365N/L366A/R371I) caused a −179 mV shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation (8Miller A.G. Aldrich R.W. Neuron. 1996; 16: 853-858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because triple mutant Shaker channels were significantly inactivated at −80 mV, further hyperpolarization permitted channels to recover from inactivation into the open state. This effectively converted the outward rectifier Shaker K+ channel into an inward rectifier channel, because the inactivation gate (N-terminal ball domain) acted like an activation gate. Indirect evidence for the second hypothesis comes from the gating behavior of a mutant HERG K+ channel. A single mutation in the S4–S5 linker of HERG (D540K) destabilized the closed state and permitted the channel to reopen upon hyperpolarization to membrane potentials negative to −90 mV (9Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 514(Pt 3): 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Hyperpolarization-dependent activation of D540K is still present in channels where inactivation has been removed by additional mutations (10Mitcheson J.S. Chen J. Sanguinetti M.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Whatever the specific mechanism, it is possible that only small changes in the Kv channel voltage sensor or associated structures would be sufficient to account for the unique gating properties of HCN channels. Extensive structure-function studies have established that the positively charged S4 domain is the voltage sensor of voltage-gated potassium, sodium, and calcium channels (11Sigworth F.J. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 1993; 27: 1-40Crossref Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 12Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The S4 voltage sensor of Kv channel subunits contains 5 to 7 basic residues spaced at every third position. Compared with Kv channels, mammalian HCN channels have a much larger S4 domain, containing 9 basic (and 1 Ser) residues at every third position (Fig. 1). Counting in the N- to C-terminal direction, the Ser of HCN channels is located in what would otherwise be the 6th charged position of the putative S4 domain, and is followed by 4 additional Arg residues. The functional role of the Ser in HCN channels is unknown. The length of a membrane-spanning α-helix is about 20 amino acids. At a fixed transmembrane voltage, the entire putative S4 domain (28 amino acids from Lys-291 to Arg-318 in HCN2) could not simultaneously traverse the membrane. Thus, it is likely that only a subset of the charged residues in the S4 domain of HCN subunits contribute to channel gating. Recent evidence suggests that the S2 and S3 domains of Kv channels are also crucial for channel function (13Papazian D.M. Shao X.M. Sech S.-A. Mock A.F. Huang Y. Wainstock D.H.

These domains contain acidic residues in highly conserved positions, which interact specifically with basic residues in the S4 domain to mediate channel folding and gating (13Papazian D.M. Shao X.M.

Although not yet investigated, mutation of the charged residues in the S2, S3, and S4 domains of HCN channels would be expected to have different functional consequences consistent with their role in channel gating and subunit folding.Figure 1Comparison of sequences for S2, S3, and S4 domains of HCN2, Shaker, and HERG channel subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the structural and functional role of the charged residues in the HCN2 S4 domain, the 9 basic residues and the single Ser (Ser-306) were individually neutralized to Gln.

The effects of each mutation on the amplitude and voltage dependence of HCN2 channel currents expressed in Xenopusoocytes were determined using two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques, and the surface membrane expression of protein was determined by single cell luminometry. The HCN2 channel cDNA was cloned from Marathon-Ready (CLONTECH) mouse brain cDNA into the pSP64T oocyte expression vector. The sequence of the clone was identical with the published HAC1 clone (3Ludwig A. Zong X. Jeglitsch M. Hofmann F. Biel M. Nature. 1998; 393: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), except for a single nucleotide change causing a K283R substitution. To facilitate subcloning, the very GC-rich N terminus portion of the HCN2 channel (encoding amino acids 2–130) was deleted. We refer to the wild-type N terminus truncated clone as ntHCN2. All mutations were introduced into ntHCN2 cDNA as described previously (19Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Before use in expression experiments, each construct was confirmed with restriction mapping and DNA sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified segment. cRNA for injection into oocytes was prepared with SP6 Capscribe (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following linearization withEcoRI. To monitor the surface expression of channels, a modified hemagglutinin (HA) protein epitope was inserted between Gly-284 and Ile-285 located within the S3–S4 extracellular loop of WT or mutant ntHCN2. The amino acid sequence of the HA-tagged region was284GISAYGITYPYDVPDYAI285. Stage IV and VXenopus oocytes were isolated and injected (20Goldin A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 487-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Goldin A.L. Sumikawa K. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 279-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with 30 ng of cRNA encoding ntHCN2 or one of the mutant ntHCN2 channels. The oocytes were cultured in Barth's solution supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamicin and 1 mm pyruvate at 18 °C for 1–3 days before use in voltage clamp experiments. The chemiluminescence assay was performed as described by Zerangueet al. (22Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Briefly, oocytes were blocked with ND96/1% bovine serum albumin, labeled with anti-HA antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody sequentially, then washed with ND96 solution. Oocytes were immersed in 80 μl of SuperSignal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay substrate (Pierce). Relative light units (RLU) were counted for 4 s with an MLX microtiter plate luminometer. For voltage clamp experiments, oocytes were bathed in a modified ND96 solution containing (in mm): 96 NaCl, 4 KCl, 1.8 MgC12, 0.1 CaC12, 5 HEPES; pH 7.6. Currents were recorded at room temperature (23–25 °C) using standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp techniques (23Stuhmer W. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 319-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The voltage dependence of ntHCN2 channel activation was determined from a holding potential of −30 or 0 mV. Pulses of 3-s duration were applied to potentials ranging from 0 to −150 mV to activate current. Tail currents were usually measured at −130 mV. Normalized tail current amplitude was plotted versus test potential to obtain the relative conductance-voltage (G-V) relationship and fitted with a Boltzmann function. Date are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n = number of oocytes). The biophysical properties of full-length HCN2 and ntHCN2 channel currents were relatively similar. Both currents activated slowly upon membrane hyperpolarization from a holding potential of 0 mV and had similar amplitudes when fully activated (Fig. 2, B andC). TheG-V relationship was determined by plotting the relative amplitude of tail currents at −130 mV following 3-s pulses to potentials ranging from −20 to −140 mV (Fig. 2 D). TheV 0.5 and slope factor for full-length HCN2 channel current was −73 ± 0.3 mV and 10 ± 0.2 mV, respectively (n = 7). The V 0.5of ntHCN2 channel current was −85 ± 0.2 mV, a shift of −12 mV compared with full-length HCN2. In addition, the slope of the activation curve was steeper (k = 7.7 ± 0.2 mV). Mutations of any one of the 4 basic residues located in the outermost positions of the putative S4 domain were well tolerated. Channels formed by subunits, where one of these residues (Lys-291, Arg-294, Arg-297, Arg-300) was neutralized to Q, produced currents with relatively normal amplitudes (Fig. 3,A and B). Current amplitudes at −130 mV, where channels were fully activated, were also similar for mutant and ntHCN2 channels (see Fig. 6). The only notable change, caused by all four point mutations, was a negative shift in the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 3 D, TableI). Neutralization of all 4 basic residues, K291Q/R294Q/R2987Q/R300Q (quadruple mutant) induced a current with similar behavior (Fig. 3 C) but also shifted the voltage dependence of activation by at least −49 mV relative to ntHCN2 channel current (Fig. 3 D). This change inV 0.5 was nearly the same as predicted by addition of the individual shifts caused by the 4 single mutations (−44.2 mV). However, the slope of the activation curve (k = 19.2 ± 1.7 mV) for the quadruple mutation was also less than measured for any of the single mutant channels (k = 8.5 to 9.5 mV; Table I). The shift in theV 0.5 for the quadruple mutant channel current may be underestimated, because we could not pulse negatively enough to invoke full activation of these channels.Figure 6Relative current amplitude for mutant and HA-tagged ntHCN2 channels. Currents were measured at −130 mV following a 3-s pulse to −140 mV. For comparative purposes, current amplitude for each mutant channel was normalized to that measured for ntHCN2 channel current. *, significantly different from ntHCN2,p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISummary of half-points and slopes determined from fit of tail current amplitudes with Boltzmann function for WT and mutant HCN2 channelsConstructV 0.5 1-aV 0.5, half-point of activation curve; k, slope of activation curve; n, number of oocytes; Shift, change inV 0.5 relative to ntHCN2 channel current; ND, not determined, because construct was too far shifted (K303Q) or tail currents were too small (S306Q).knShiftmVmVHCN2−73.0 ± 0.310.0 ± 0.27+11.6ntHCN2−84.6 ± 0.27.7 ± 0.25K291Q−92.1 ± 0.38.5 ± 0.210−7.5K291E−103.9 ± 0.79.1 ± 0.37−19.3R294Q−93.3 ± 0.49.0 ± 0.26−8.7R297Q−95.8 ± 0.68.8 ± 0.36−11.2R300Q−101.4 ± 1.29.5 ± 0.56−16.8K303QNDS306Q/TNDR309QNo expressionR312Q−74.6 ± 1.210.7 ± 0.46+10.0R315Q/A/CNo expressionR318Q/A/WNo expressionQuadruple mut−133.7 ± 1.219.2 ± 1.78−49.11-a V 0.5, half-point of activation curve; k, slope of activation curve; n, number of oocytes; Shift, change inV 0.5 relative to ntHCN2 channel current; ND, not determined, because construct was too far shifted (K303Q) or tail currents were too small (S306Q). Open table in a new tab The shift in the voltage dependence of activation could be caused by a loss of surface charge screening normally contributed by the basic residues. This possibility was investigated by determining the shift inV 0.5 caused by addition of Mg2+ to the extracellular solution for ntHCN2 and each mutant HCN2 channel. Elevating [Mg2+]o from 0.1 to 30 mm caused a progressive positive shift in theV 0.5 of activation for all channels. A greater shift was observed for K291Q HCN2 than ntHCN2 or any of the other channels containing a single charge neutralization (Fig.4). Increasing [Mg2+]o to 10 mm eliminated the difference in V 0.5 between K291Q and ntHCN2 channels. This finding suggested that the −7.5-mV shift inV 0.5 caused by the K291Q mutation and part of the shift observed for the quadruple mutant channel (for [Mg2+]o = 1.8 mm) could be due to loss of a positive surface charge normally contributed by the −NH3+ of Lys-291. If this were so, then mutation of Lys-291 to an acidic group (e.g. Glu) would be expected to cause an even greater shift in V 0.5, because the −COO− group would effectively increase the negative surface charge near the voltage sensor. As predicted, K291E did produce an even greater shift in V 0.5(−21.6-mV shift) than that caused by neutralization. However, elevation of [Mg2+]o did not overcome the voltage shift in gating for K291E or R294Q, R297Q, or R300Q or the quadruple mutant as would be expected if due only to a surface charge-screening mechanism. Functional channels were also produced when the outermost basic residues were mutated to amino acids other than Gln (i.e.K291A, R294A, R297C, R300C; data not shown), suggesting that positive charges at these positions are not essential for channel folding or gating. Channels formed by subunits containing a neutralization of the fifth basic residue in the putative S4 domain (K303Q) activated more slowly and at potentials more negative than ntHCN2 channels (Fig.5 A). For example, at −140 mV, the time constants for activation of ntHCN2 channel current was 169 ± 13 ms (n = 6), but 1171 ± 128 ms (n = 9) for K303Q ntHCN2 channel current. Due to the presence of endogenous inward Cl− currents that also activated slowly and at very negative potentials, we could not pulse long enough at very negative potentials to obtain a reliable measure of the V 0.5 for the activation of K303Q ntHCN2 channel current. However, based on the I-V relationship following 3-s pulses to test potentials between 0 and −150 mV (Fig.5 B), the V 0.5 must be shifted by at least −40 mV. These findings indicate that Lys-303 contributes significantly to voltage sensing, and that the K303Q mutation stabilizes a closed state of the channel. Ser-306 is located between the 5th and 6th basic residues of the S4 domain. It has been postulated that this Ser might contribute to the unusual voltage dependence of HCN channel gating (6Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1998; 21: 5-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Santoro B. Tibbs G.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 741-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). S306Q ntHCN2 channel current was almost 9-fold smaller than ntHCN2 current. In addition, S306Q ntHCN2 channel current was largely instantaneous, with only a very small time-dependent component (Fig.5 C). Current activated by negative pulses was nearly all time-dependent for WT channel current, whereas the time-dependent component of S306Q ntHCN2 channel current accounted for only 10% of the total current. Substitution of Ser-306 with a relatively conserved residue (S306T) induced a current with properties similar to S306Q ntHCN2, whereas substitution with either an Arg or Tyr resulted in complete loss of function (not shown). These data indicate that Ser-306 is crucial for normal gating. R312Q ntHCN2 channel current was similar to ntHCN2 channel current, but had an amplitude that was ∼5-fold less. This reduction was not caused by a shift in the voltage dependence of channel activation, because theV 0.5 for activation of R312Q HCN2 channels (−74.6 ± 1.2 mV) was shifted by +10 mV compared with ntHCN2 (Table I). In contrast with the mutations discussed above, mutation of Arg-309, Arg-315, or Arg-318 to Gln caused a complete loss of channel function, defined as lack of measurable current in response to a hyperpolarizing pulse to −140 mV. Other amino acid substitutions for some of these residues (R315A, R315C, R318A, R318W) also caused loss of channel function (not shown). These mutations might disrupt subunit folding, prevent normal gating, or shift the voltage dependence of activation to very negative potentials. Partial or complete loss of function in mutant HCN2 channels could result from altered gating properties (e.g. lack of channel opening, reduction in single channel conductance, or open probability), or defects in folding and/or trafficking that cause reduced surface expression of mature protein. To help distinguish between these possibilities, the surface expression of WT and mutant ntHCN2 channels containing a HA-epitope tag was determined using a single oocyte chemiluminescence technique (22Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Luminometry experiments were performed on oocytes expressing mutant ntHCN2 constructs that either poorly expressed (K303Q, S306Q, R312Q) or exhibited complete loss of function (R309Q, R315Q, R318Q). The HA epitope was inserted into the S3–S4 linker of ntHCN2 channels as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This construct (ntHCN2-HA) functionally expressed in oocytes, but had a shifted voltage dependence of activation. The V 0.5 and slope factor for activation was −114 ± 0.7 mV and 6 ± 0.3 mV, respectively, when determined with 6-s pulses (n = 9). Although V 0.5 was shifted by −29 mV, the amplitude of fully activated current at −130 mV for ntHCN2-HA was not changed compared with untagged ntHCN2 (Fig.6). Thus, addition of the HA epitope altered the gating of ntHCN2 but did not significantly change surface expression of the channel. The chemiluminescence signal (in RLU) of oocytes expressing ntHCN2-HA was more than 1000-fold the signal from oocytes expressing untagged ntHCN2 channels. The surface expression of HA-tagged K303Q or S306Q mutant channels was only partially reduced when compared with ntHCN2-HA (Fig. 7 A). The relative surface expression of protein was reduced 28% for K303Q channels and 14% for S306Q channels. These data suggest that channels containing either mutation are able to fold and traffic to the surface membrane relatively normally but that gating associated with channel opening is dysfunctional. The surface expression of HA-tagged R312Q channels was reduced by ∼4-fold, consistent with the current reduction caused by this mutation. This correlation indicates that the reduction of current amplitude for R312Q was due to the partial loss of surface expression and not an alteration in single channel properties. Mutant channels that exhibited complete loss of functional expression (R309Q, R315Q, and R318Q) all had reduced levels of surface expression (Fig.7 A). The large reduction (94%) in surface expression of R309Q channels sufficiently explains the lack of measurable currents. However, the reduction in surface expression for R315Q (75%) and R318Q (54%) was not enough to explain the absence of currents in oocytes expressing these mutant channels. Current at −130 mV averaged 20 μA in oocytes injected with 75 ng of cRNA encoding ntHCN2 channels. Even a reduction of 75% of this current would be easily measurable. Thus, neutralization of Arg-315 or Arg-318 prevents normal channel opening, in addition to reducing surface expression of protein. It has been proposed that interaction of the S2 and S3 domains with the S4 domain of Kv channels facilitates subunit folding and modulates voltage sensing (13Papazian D.M. Shao X.M. Sech S.-A. Mock A.F. Huang Y. Wainstock D.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1293-1301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 17Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys.

Physiol. 2000; 115: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The S2 and S3 domains of HCN2 channel subunits each contain 2 Asp residues, Asp-225 and Asp-231 in S2, and Asp-267 and Asp-275 in S3. The position of these residues is conserved in HERG and similar to the relative location of Asp and Glu residues in Shaker channels (Fig. 1). The Asp residues of ntHCN2 were mutated to Asn to neutralize, but not significantly alter size, of the amino acid. Neutralization of any Asp residue caused loss of channel function, defined as lack of measurable currents in response to a hyperpolarizing pulse to −140 mV. The surface expression of the S2 and S3 mutant ntHCN2 channels was also determined using the single cell luminometry technique. The D225N mutation reduced surface expression by 98% (Fig. 7 B), fully explaining the inability to record currents in oocytes injected with cRNA encoding this mutant channel. HA-tagged channels containing the other single mutations (D231N, D267N, and D275N) reduced surface expression by 58–75% (Fig. 7 B), not enough to explain the lack of measurable currents. Thus, Asp-231 in the S2 domain, and Asp-267 and Asp-275 in the S3 domain, must have important roles in folding and gating of the channel. Lys-291, Arg-294, Arg-297, and Arg-300 are located in the outermost portion of the putative S4 domain. Substitutions of these basic residues with Gln produced functional channels with whole-cell current amplitude similar to WT ntHCN2. Individual mutation of these 4 basic residues to Gln caused a hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel opening with a trend toward a more pronounced shift for residues further away from Lys-291. More interestingly, combining all four mutations in a single channel had a cumulative effect. The shift in voltage dependence for activation of the quadruple mutant ntHCN2 channel (−49 mV) was similar to the addition of the shifts caused by each single mutation. The relative positions of theG-V relationships along the voltage axis reflects the stability of closed and open states and does not indicate a change in net gating charge. Further studies are required to examine the effect of these mutations on gating valence (z g). Even if neutralization of Lys-291, Arg-294, Arg-297, or Arg-300 does not reduce z g, the observed shift in the G-V relationship indicates that these mutations stabilize one or more closed states, and that mutation of all four charges had a cumulative effect. These charges could move through a region of uniform electric field during voltage-dependent transitions of the S4 domain. Alternatively, these charges may reside outside the transmembrane electric field and alter the G-V relationship via a surface charge effect. Neutralization of these residues may alter the net charge in the vicinity of the outer region of the voltage sensor. Indirect evidence in favor of the surface charge hypothesis was the finding that mutation of Lys-291 to a neutral Gln shifted theG-V relationship by −7.5 mV, whereas mutation to a negatively charged Glu shifted the relationship by −19 mV. However, we found that elevation of [Mg2+]o caused similar shifts in the V 0.5 of WT and mutant HCN2 channel currents. Although screening of excess negative surface charge with Mg2+ did not cause the expected shifts in theG-V relationship, this may be because Mg2+ could not substitute for the positively charged residues of the protein, which may be shielded from the extracellular bulk solution by hydrophobic residues in the S3–S4 linker. Another possibility is that all 4 basic residues are situated outside the membrane field and mutation alters the voltage dependence of gating by an unknown mechanism. Whatever the mechanism for the shift in theG-V curves by mutation of the most N-terminal basic residues of the putative S4 domain, it seems reasonable to conclude that these residues play no role in subunit folding and only limited roles in voltage-dependent gating. By contrast, in Shaker channels, individual neutralization of each of the first 4 residues produced a variable effect on the voltage dependence of activation, with leftward shifts for some and rightward shifts for other residues (24Papazian D.M. Timple L.C. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1991; 349: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 25Liman E.R. Hess P. Weaver F. Koren G. Nature. 1991; 353: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). SPIH is a hyperpolarization-activated cation channel with a much more positive range of activation than HCN channels (4Gauss R. Seifert R. Kaupp U.B. Nature. 1998; 393: 583-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The S4 domain of SPIH channels has an acidic residue (Glu) in a position equivalent to Lys-291 in HCN2 channels. However, this substitution does not account for the much more positive range of activation for SPIH, because K291E HCN2 channels activated at even more negative potentials than WT HCN2. HCN channels are unusual in having a Ser residue (Ser-306 in HCN2) located in a position that is otherwise a basic residue in Kv channels. The surface expression of S306Q ntHCN2 channels was relatively normal compared with WT channels, but the current magnitude was reduced 9-fold. Moreover, current activated by hyperpolarization was nearly instantaneous. These data suggest that Ser-306 is essential for channel gating but not for subunit folding. The surface expression of K303Q ntHCN2 channels was similar to WT ntHCN2 channels, but the voltage-dependent activation was very slow and shifted in the hyperpolarized direction. Because of interference from endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl− currents, we could only accurately record currents for this mutant channel at potentials positive to −150 mV. Thus, Lys-303 may be an important contributor to voltage sensing and may carry a significant amount of gating charge. Comparison of gating currents for WT and K303Q HCN2 channels will be required to confirm this possibility. Mutations of three basic residues (Arg-309, Arg-315, and Arg-318) in the S4 domain caused loss of channel function. The loss of channel activity for Arg-309 results largely from a folding and/or trafficking defect as indicated by the 94% reduction in surface expression. However, loss of channel function by the R315Q and R318Q HCN2 mutations cannot be explained by the same mechanism, because these mutations only reduced surface expression of protein by 74% and 54%, respectively. These findings indicate either that these mutant channels were incapable of opening or that the voltage dependence of their activation was far shifted in the negative direction. State-dependent salt bridge formation between Lys-374 and Arg-377 in S4 and Glu-283 and Glu-293 of S2 or Asp-316 of S3 in Shaker was proposed to be important for channel stabilization. Similar electrostatic interactions between Arg-315 and Arg-318 and 1 or more acidic residues of the S2 and S3 domains of HCN2 may also be important for stabilization of folded subunits and channel gating. Further studies are required to define the mechanisms of channel dysfunction caused by mutation of these basic residues. However, it is clear that Arg-315 and Arg-318 are crucial residues for normal function of HCN2 and that Arg-309 has a critical role in channel folding and may also be important in gating. The substantial decrease in current magnitude caused by neutralization of Arg-312 could be explained by a concomitant reduction in surface expression of protein. The remaining current had relatively normal gating properties, suggesting that this residue may have a key role in stabilization of subunit folding but probably is not critical for gating. KAT1 is a K+ channel cloned from the plantArabidopsis thaliana (26Anderson J.A. Huprikar S.S. Kochian L.V. Lucas W.J. Gaber R.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3736-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). These channels open slowly in response to hyperpolarization and also have overall structural similarity to the HCN channels. However, in contrast with HCN, neutralization of two charged residues in the S4 domain of KAT1 (R176L, R177Q) shifted the voltage dependence of activation by +89 and +54 mV, respectively (27Zei P.C. Aldrich R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 679-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Another difference in the gating of KAT1 and HCN channels is the role of the N terminus. Deletion of half of the N terminus (Δ2–34) of KAT1 eliminated currents, and a smaller deletion (Δ20–34) caused a −65 mV shift in the voltage dependence of activation (28Marten I. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3448-3453Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was proposed that the N terminus contributes to the voltage sensitivity of KAT1 by contributing to the electric field sensed by the voltage sensor (29Marten I. Hoshi T. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2953-2962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). By contrast, we found that deletion of two-thirds of the N terminus (Δ2–130) of HCN2 caused only a −12 mV shift. Thus, the N-terminal domain does not appear to have a crucial role in the gating of HCN2 channels as proposed for KAT1 channels. D225 located in the S2 domain of HCN2 is required for normal channel folding and/or trafficking. Neutralization of this residue to Asn reduced surface expression of the protein by 98%. In contrast, mutations of Asp-231 in S2 and the two Asp residues in S3 (Asp-267, Asp-275) to Asn only partially reduced surface expression of mutant protein, despite a total loss of channel function. The homologous acidic residues in voltage-gated K channels are more tolerant of mutation. In these channels, mutation interferes with protein folding and therefore reduces channel expression, but channels that reach the membrane appear to have relatively normal gating properties. For example, channel function was maintained after neutralization of all 3 of the acidic residues located in the S2 and S3 domains (E283Q, E293Q, and D316N) of Shaker (13Papazian D.M. Shao X.M. Sech S.-A. Mock A.F. Huang Y. Wainstock D.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1293-1301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Neutralization of all the acidic residues in the S2 and S3 domains was well tolerated in drk1 channels (16Li-Smerin Y. Hackos D.H. Swartz K.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as were two of four negative charges (Glu-235 and Glu-272 but not Glu-225 and Asp-258) in Kv1.1 channels (14Planells-Cases R. Ferrer-Montiel A.V. Patten C.D. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9422-9426Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that acidic residues located in the S2 and S3 domains are more important for normal channel gating and/or folding and trafficking to the surface membrane in HCN2 channels than in Kv channels. Further experiments are needed to determine if the loss of channel function caused by these mutations in HCN2 results from disruption of charge pairing between these acidic residues and basic residues in the S4 domain, as previously reported for Shaker channels (13Papazian D.M.

HCN channels have a similar overall structure to the voltage-gated potassium channels, including six transmembrane domains, a similar selectivity filter, and the presence of multiple basic residues in S4. However, HCN channels have a greater number (9Sanguinetti M.C. Xu Q.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 514(Pt 3): 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) of basic residues (plus 1 Ser) located at every third position in the putative S4 domain compared with Kv channels that have only 5 to 7 basic residues. Assuming the S4 of HCN2 is an α-helix, then the entire domain is too long to fit within the plane of the plasma membrane. Based on the discussion above, we propose that the region containing Lys-291 to Arg-300 is located outside of the membrane, while the lower portion of S4 (from Lys-303 to Arg-318) lies within the membrane field when the channel is in the closed state. Channel activation in response to membrane hyperpolarization is likely to involve a twisting and/or translocation of the S4 domain across the electric field of the membrane (30Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R. Bezanilla F. Nature. 1999; 402: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 31Glauner K.S. Mannuzzu L.M. Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Nature. 1999; 402: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This proposed topology for the S4 domain of HCN channels predicts potential electrostatic interactions between the basic residues of the S4 and S2/S3 domains. The relative position of the negatively charged residues in S2 and S3 are conserved among HCN2, HERG, and Shaker B channels (Fig. 1), suggesting these residues may have a conserved role in subunit folding and/or channel gating. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the charged residues of the S2, S3, and S4 domains have distinct functional roles in the structure and gating of HCN2 channels. Lys-291, Arg-294, Arg-297, and Arg-300 play a relatively minor role in gating, and are not important for channel folding or trafficking to the surface membrane. Lys-303 and Ser-306 are essential for normal gating but not for subunit folding or channel trafficking. Arg-312 is important for folding but not gating. The charged residues located at the C-terminal end of the S4 domain (Arg-309, Arg-315, and Arg-318) and the S2 and S3 domains (Asp-225, Asp-231, Asp-267, Asp-275) are crucial for normal protein folding and/or gating. Further studies will determine if some of these basic residues charge-pair with Asp residues located in the S2 and S3 domains. We thank Mike Martinez for technical assistance and Dr. N.

These enzymes play critical roles in regulating cell growth, apoptosis, intracellular calcium oscillations, and post-synaptic vesicular trafficking. The UCLA fold recognition server (threader) predicted that the conserved 300-amino acid catalytic domain, common to all 5-phosphatases, adopts the fold of the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) base excision repair endonucleases. PSI-BLAST searches of GENPEPT, using the amino acid sequence of AP endonuclease exonuclease III, identified all members of the 5-phosphatase family with highly significant scores. A sequence alignment between exonuclease III and all known 5-phosphatases revealed six highly conserved motifs containing residues that corresponded to the catalytic residues in the AP endonucleases. Mutation of each of these residues to alanine in the mammalian 43-kDa, or yeast Inp52p 5-phosphatase, resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. We predict the 5-phosphatase enzymes share a similar mechanism of catalysis to the AP endonucleases, consistent with other common functional similarities such as an absolute requirement for magnesium for activity.

The 5-phosphatases play a significant role in the regulation of many phosphoinositide signaling events and in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Recent characterization of mice or humans lacking functional 5-phosphatase isoforms has identified the role specific 5-phosphatases play in regulating cell growth, post-synaptic vesicular trafficking, and apoptosis. The Src homology 2 domain containing 5-phosphatase SHIP is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells. Gene-targeted deletion of SHIP in mice leads to early death from a syndrome that resembles chronic myeloid leukemia (9Helgason C.D. Damen J.E. Rosten P. Grewal R. Sorensen P. Chappel S.M. Borowski A.

In primary cell lines derived from Philadelphia-positive chronic myeloid leukemia patients, the expression of SHIP is reduced or absent (10Sattler M. Verma S. Byrne C.H. Shrikhande G. Winkler T.

The pre-synaptic 5-phosphatase synaptojanin associates with endocytic-coated intermediates and regulates synaptic vesicle recycling.

Lowe's oculocerebrorenal (OCRL) syndrome is a human disorder characterized by growth and mental retardation, cataracts, and renal failure resulting from loss of function mutations in an X-linked gene (OCRL1), which encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns (4,5)P2) 5-phosphatase (11Attree O.

However, mice with gene targeted deletion of OCRL show no phenotype, while 5-phosphatase II-deficient mice show little phenotype with the only noted abnormality being testicular abnormalities. Mice deficient in both OCRL and 5-phosphatase II die in utero (12Janne P.A. Suchy S.F. Bernard D. MacDonald M. Crawley J. Grinberg A. Wynshaw-Boris A. Westphal H. Nussbaum R.L. J. Clin.

Underexpression of the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase using an antisense strategy results in enhanced intracellular calcium oscillations and cellular transformation (13Speed C.J. Little P.J. Hayman J.A.

Although the 5-phosphatase enzymes are defined by their ability to remove the 5-position phosphate from the inositol ring, the catalytic mechanism and substrate-binding sites of the 5-phosphatases have yet to be defined. The various isoforms show specificity for discrete substrates, which include the water-soluble inositol phosphates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins (1,4,5)P3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins (1,3,4,5)P4), and phosphatidylinositol-derived messenger molecules PtdIns (4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns (3,4,5)P3) and phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns (3,5)P2). For example the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase only hydrolyzes Ins (1,4,5)P3 and Ins (1,3,4,5)P4. The molecular mechanisms governing each enzyme's distinct substrate specificity have not been determined. All 5-phosphatases contain a conserved 300-amino acid central region designated the “5-phosphatase domain,” which demonstrates approximately 30% amino acid identity between family members apart from the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase I), which is more extensively diverged. It has been proposed that two short amino acid motifs, WXCDXBXR and PXWCDRXL, located 60 amino acids apart in the 5-phosphatase domain, define the enzyme family and contain critical residues for both catalysis and substrate binding (15Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Mutation of conserved residues within these two motifs results in loss of enzyme activity (16Communi D. Lecocq R. Erneux C. J. Biol.

In this study, significant amino acid sequence similarities between the 5-phosphatases and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases have been identified. Furthermore, we have shown the active site residues in the AP endonucleases correspond to absolutely conserved residues in all 5-phosphatases. Mutation of these residues in mammalian and yeast 5-phosphatases results in complete loss of enzyme activity. Based upon these data, we have been able to assign functional roles to conserved residues in the 5-phosphatase family and propose a catalytic mechanism. DNA modifying and restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs. [32P]Orthophosphate was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Oligonucleotides were from Bresatec (Adelaide, Australia) and the Department of Microbiology, Monash University (Victoria, Australia). All reagents used were from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. PSI-BLAST searches (19Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) of GENPEPT using members of the 5′-phosphatase superfamily as probes failed to identify significant sequence similarity to any protein family of known structure. The amino acid sequence of the 5′-phosphatase domain from synaptojanin, SHIP1, SHIP2, and Inp52p was submitted to the UCLA fold prediction server (20Fischer D. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). In each case the Gon+predss+MULT method identified the Escherichia coli AP endonuclease, exonuclease III as the top scoring fold with the endonuclease DNase I also returning a significant score. Exonuclease III and DNase I are homologous proteins that share very low (14%) sequence identity (21Mol C.D. Kuo C.F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We performed further PSI-BLAST searches of GenBank™ (current to April 10, 2000) using the sequence of exonuclease III as a probe and an expect value for inclusion in the next iteration (h) of 0.001. The search was performed to convergence and identified all members of the 5′-phosphatase family with highly significant scores (Table I). A search using the sequence of the human homolog of exonuclease III, AP endonuclease I (APE1), as a probe also identified the 5′-phosphatase family with highly significant scores.Table IExpect scores for representative members of the 5-phosphatase family identified in a PSI-BLAST search of GenBank™ using the sequence of exonuclease III as a probe and h = 0.001Name of 5-phosphataseExpect score in 9th iteration (convergence)5-phosphatase II (75 kDa 5-phosphatase)3 × 10−44OCRL (human) Lowe's protein4 × 10−41107-kDa (PIPP)2 × 10−38Synaptojanin (human)7 × 10−38Inp52p (S. cerevisiae)1 × 10−37SHIP (human)4 × 10−31Pharbin (rat)1 × 10−30SHIP-2 (human)7 × 10−3043-kDa 5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase I)6 × 10−17The search converged in the 9th iteration and identified all members of the 5-phosphatase family with highly significant scores. Open table in a new tab The search converged in the 9th iteration and identified all members of the 5-phosphatase family with highly significant scores. Nine members of the 5′-phosphatase family (OCRL, the 5-phosphatase II, Inp52p, 43-kDa 5-phosphatase (also called 5-phosphatase I), SHIP1, SHIP2, synaptojanin, pharbin, and the 107-kDa 5-phosphatase (also called PIPP)) were aligned using ClustalW (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar). The 43-kDa 5-phosphatase is extremely diverged compared with other family members; therefore, pairwise alignments produced by PSI-BLAST were used to align the type I 43-kDa phosphatase to the other sequences. The pairwise alignment between exonuclease III and OCRL produced by PSI-BLAST was used to guide the alignment of exonuclease III to the 5′ phosphatases. The x-ray crystal structure of exonuclease III (Protein Data Bank identifier 1AKO) was obtained from the protein data bank (21Mol C.D. Kuo C.F. Thayer M.M. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A.

Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was used to build a homology model of the human 5-phosphatase OCRL based upon the structure of exonuclease III. We were able to predict the core structure and active site of human OCRL with confidence; however, no attempt was made to predict the structure of the loops surrounding the active site, since these were extensively diverged from the template structure. Site-directed mutagenesis of the murine 43-kDa and yeast Inp52p 5-phosphatases was performed by using sequential polymerase chain reactions. The sequence of all mutants was verified by dideoxy sequencing of both strands. The wild type and mutant 5-phosphatase recombinant proteins were expressed as His tag fusion proteins in the pTrcHis B (murine 43-kDa 5-phosphatase) and pMALc2 (yeast Inp52p) expression systems in E. coli and purified by Talon affinity chromatography as described previously (17Communi D. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Inp52p recombinant proteins contained only the central 5-phosphatase domain and the C-terminal proline rich region (nucleotides 1609–3552), and lacked the N-terminal SacI domain. Recombinant proteins were assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining, and immunoblot analysis using anti-His tag antibodies. The structural integrity of all wild type and mutant recombinant proteins were assessed by far UV CD spectroscopy using a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter. Spectra were collected at 20 °C in a 0.01-cm cell using a bandwidth of 1 nm, a scanning speed of 20 nm/min, and a 1-s time response. For each enzyme preparation, the final spectrum is the result of five accumulated scans. Ins(1,[32P]4,[32P]5)P3was isolated from erythrocyte ghosts as described previously (25Downes C.P. Mussat M.C. Michell R.H. Biochem. J. 1982; 203: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of Ins(1,[32P]4,[32P]5)P3 was measured by extraction of released32PO43− using a substrate concentration of 30 μm and three linear protein concentrations in triplicate (26Connolly T.M. Bross T.E. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7868-7874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdIns (4,5)P25-phosphatase activity was performed as described previously and expressed as nanomoles of PtdIns (4,5)P2 hydrolyzed/min/mg of recombinant wild type or mutant protein (27Matzaris M. Jackson S.P. Laxminarayan K.M. Speed C.J. Mitchell C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3397-3402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSI-BLAST searches of GENPEPT using members of the 5-phosphatase superfamily as probes failed to identify any significant sequence similarity to any protein family of known structure. In order to identify a putative homologue of known structure, the amino acid sequence of the conserved 5-phosphatase domain from synaptojanin, SHIP1, SHIP2, and the yeast 5-phosphatase Inp52p was submitted to the UCLA hybrid fold recognition server. In each case the domain was predicted to adopt an AP base excision repair endonuclease-like fold. In addition, exonuclease III was identified as the top scoring fold when these 5′-phosphatase sequences were submitted to the hybrid fold recognition server (data not shown) (20Fischer D. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The AP enzyme family includes the mammalian APE1 endonucleases and E. coli exonuclease III, both of which play a crucial role in the base excision repair pathway, cleaving the DNA sugar phosphate backbone 5′ to AP sites to prime DNA repair synthesis (28Wilson III, D.M.

The AP endonucleases share a common fold and similar catalytic mechanism to DNase I, despite extremely low amino acid sequence identity (14% for exonuclease IIIversus DNase I) (21Mol C.D. Kuo C.F.

The search converged in the 9th iteration, and all members of the 5-phosphatase family were identified with expect scores between 3 × 10−44 (5-phosphatase II (INPP5B)) and 6 × 10−17 (5-phosphatase I, or 43-kDa 5-phosphatase) (Table I). These are highly significant scores, well below the threshold of 1 × 10−6 as previously defined by Park et al. (32Park J. Karplus K. Barrett C. Hughey R. Haussler D. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1201-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Pairwise sequence alignments (PSI-BLAST) were used to construct a multiple sequence alignment between exonuclease III and members of the 5-phosphatase family (Fig. 1). We identified six highly conserved motifs (termed motifs 1–6, respectively), comprising four novel sequences (TWN, GXQE, NXH, and SDHXPV) and the two previously identified “5-phosphatase motifs” (GDXNXR and PXWXDR), which have been used to define the 5-phosphatase enzyme family (15Jefferson A.B.

Our sequence alignment is in broad agreement with that of Dlakic; however, in this study we focus upon conservation within all the 5′-phosphatase family members with comparison specifically with the AP-endonucleases and investigate via site-directed mutagenesis the role of conserved residues in 5-phosphatase enzyme function (38Dlakic M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 272-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Three high resolution x-ray crystal structures of human APE1 in complex with abasic DNA have been resolved allowing a detailed reaction mechanism for the AP endonucleases to be proposed (33Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) (Table II). The target phosphate is orientated by a His/Asp pair and a conserved Asn. Nucleophilic attack is initiated via a conserved Asp, which activates a water molecule, forming the attacking nucleophile. Cleavage is achievedvia inversion of the phosphate configuration. A conserved Glu coordinates a Mg2+ ion that stabilizes the transition state and leaving group. An alignment of all known 5-phosphatases reveals these catalytic residues critical for endonuclease activity correspond to absolutely conserved residues in all 5′-phosphatases (data not shown). It is noteworthy that both the AP endonucleases and 5-phosphatases share an absolute dependence on magnesium ions for activity and both attack a sugar phosphate substrate. We therefore hypothesized that these conserved 5-phosphatase motifs may perform similar catalytic roles to those described for AP endonucleases. To test this hypothesis, we mutated residues in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase, an Ins (1,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase, and the yeast Inp52p, a PtdIns (4,5)P2 5-phosphatase. Mutations of conserved residues in motif 4 and 5 have already been reported (TableIII) (15Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9370-9377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 16Communi D. Lecocq R. Erneux C. J. Biol.

We also mutated (H184A) in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase, which corresponds to Inp52p (H730A) within motif 3 (NXH). Although this residue is absolutely conserved in all 5-phosphatases, it does not share a functional partner in the AP endonucleases. However, the distantly related endonuclease DNase I contains a conserved histidine in this position, which has been shown to be essential for enzyme activity (30Suck D. Oefner C. Nature. 1986; 321: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 34Jones S.J. Worrall A.F. Connolly B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We expressed and purified the wild type recombinant 43-kDa 5-phosphatase and recombinant yeast Inp52p and each of the mutants shown in Table III using a pTrcHis expression system and affinity purification as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mutant and wild type 43-kDa and Inp52p 5-phosphatases appeared as homogeneous 43-kDa and 115-kDa polypeptides, respectively, on Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Secondary structure analysis of the mutant forms compared with wild type 43-kDa enzyme using far UV CD spectroscopy showed no change in the overall structure of any of the mutants (data not shown). We assayed the wild type 43-kDa and In52p and all mutant 5-phosphatases for their ability to hydrolyze Ins (1,4,5)P3, or PtdIns (4,5)P2, respectively, and expressed enzyme activity as a percentage of that observed in the wild type enzyme. Mutation of residues that correspond to primary catalytic residues in the AP-endonucleases in either the 43-kDa (D232A in motif 4, and H385A in motif 6), or Inp52p (D476A in motif 4) demonstrated complete loss of Ins (1,4,5)P3 or PtdIns (4,5)P2 5-phosphatase activity respectively (Figs. 2 and3). Other conserved residues that we predict play a primary role in enzyme catalysis have been investigated and reported in previous studies (16Communi D. Lecocq R. Erneux C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11676-11683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17Communi D. Erneux C. Biochem.

All enzyme assays were performed using 2.5 mm Mg2+ except where indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A molecular model of the human 5-phosphatase OCRL was built using the crystal structure of exonuclease III as a template (Fig.4). The majority of residues conserved between the two families map to the core of the structure, enabling the active site to be modeled with confidence. However, no attempt was made to model the loops surrounding the active site since sequence similarity is minimal in these regions. We have predicted functional roles for the conserved motifs in the 5-phosphatases as assigned by analogy with the structure function studies recently reported for human APE1 (Fig. 4) (33Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). We propose that in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase His-385 (motif 6) hydrogen bonds to Asp-349 (motif 5) to form a His/Asp pair that together with Asn-234 (motif 4, corresponds to Asn-478 in 5-phosphatase II) orientates the 5′-phosphate group of the inositol ring. Asp-232 (motif 4) corresponds to the catalytic Asp in the AP endonucleases. We predict that this residue in the 5-phosphatase enzymes is responsible for generating an attacking nucleophile. Cleavage may be achieved via inversion of configuration, with the Mg2+ ion stabilizing the transition state and the Ins (1,4)P2 leaving group. In addition to the primary catalytic residues, we have identified residues within the active site that are absolutely conserved in both 5-phosphatases and AP endonucleases. These include residues in motif 6, Pro-387 and Val-388, which in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase are absolutely essential for enzyme activity (Fig. 2). The x-ray crystal structure of APE1 reveals the catalytic Asp is orientated by forming a hydrogen bond to the side chain of a conserved Asn (33Mol C.D. Izumi T. Mitra S. Tainer J.A. Nature. 2000; 403: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The corresponding residue (Asn-18) in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatases is located in motif 1 (Tables Iand II). Mutation of this residue in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase (N18A) results in complete loss of enzyme activity indicating that this residue may play a similar role to that shown for APE1. We noted that, within motif 1, two residues N-terminal to the catalytic Asn is a threonine residue that is conserved in most 5-phosphatases, but not endonucleases. Mutation of this residue in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase (T16A) had minimal effect on enzyme activity, consistent with our contention this does not represent a catalytic residue. Other mutations in residues outside the putative catalytic motifs such as F392A in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase not present in endonucleases do not result in significant (more than 50%) loss of enzyme activity (Fig. 2). The x-ray crystal structures of the AP endonucleases and DNase I have shown that the essential Mg2+ ion is coordinated by a conserved Glu (30Suck D. Oefner C. Nature. 1986; 321: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 31Gorman M.A. Morera S. Rothwell D.G. de La Fortelle E. Mol C.D. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Freemont P.S.

We identified the corresponding residue in the 5-phosphatases. Mutation of the proposed magnesium binding residue (E55A or E55Q in motif 1) in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase, or E631A in the yeast Inp52p resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. Previous studies have shown enzyme activity of DNase I recombinant protein with this magnesium-binding residue mutated can be recovered using high concentrations of magnesium (35Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, we noted that both the 43-kDa (E55A) and Inp52p (E631A) mutant 5-phosphatases, even in the presence of increasing magnesium concentrations up to 100 mm, demonstrated no recovery of enzyme activity (Figs. 2and 3). Both the AP endonucleases and DNase I family contain a conserved Asp, one residue N-terminal to the active site His (motif 6). The role of this residue in endonuclease function has not been firmly assigned; however, it may play a role in coordinating the Mg2+ ion (35Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This position corresponds to Asp-384 in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase (motif 6), which we show in this study is absolutely essential for enzyme activity (Fig. 2). A significant difference between the AP endonucleases and DNase I is the presence of a second His/Glu pair located within the active site of DNase I, which is proposed to act as a general acid stabilizing the leaving group (30Suck D. Oefner C. Nature. 1986; 321: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this second His in DNase I has confirmed that this residue is required for catalytic activity (34Jones S.J. Worrall A.F. Connolly B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the glutamine reduced, but did not abolish, catalytic function. Comparison of AP endonucleases and the 5-phosphatase family with the sequence of DNase I reveals that all 5-phosphatases also contain this second absolutely conserved histidine (His-184 in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase in motif 3). However, analysis of the 5-phosphatase sequence alignment and our molecular model shows that no conserved Glu or Asp is available to pair with His-184. Mutation of H184A in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase and the corresponding residue in Inp52p (H730A) results in complete loss of catalytic activity (Figs. 2and 3). The x-ray crystal structure of DNase I reveals that this histidine residue is in close proximity to the O2P atom of the target phosphate. We predict that, in the 43-kDa 5-phosphatase, His-184 in motif 3 hydrogen bonds to and further polarizes the scissile phosphate (see Fig. 4). In conclusion, we have identified six conserved motifs in the 5-phosphatase family and have shown via site-directed mutagenesis that conserved residues within these motifs are crucial for catalytic activity. Based upon similarity to the AP endonucleases, we have been able to assign functional roles to these conserved motifs and propose a catalytic mechanism for the 5-phosphatase family consistent with our mutagenesis data. In the absence of high resolution crystallographic data, the use of threading in conjunction with motif-based data base searching has allowed a working model of this important family of enzymes to be proposed, upon which further experiments investigating the substrate specificity can be based.

The major COOH-terminal fragment (CTF) in brain was identified as βAPP-CTF-(11–98), which is consistent with the observation that cultured neurons generate primarily Aβ-(11–40). In PS1−/− murine neurons and fibroblasts expressing the loss-of-function PS1D385A mutant, CTFs accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and lysosomes, but not late endosomes. There were some subtle differences in the subcellular distribution of CTFs in PS1−/− neurons as compared with PS1D385A mutant fibroblasts. However, there was no obvious redistribution of full-length βAPP or of markers of other organelles in either mutant. Blockade of endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking indicated that in PS1−/− neurons (as in normal cells) trafficking of βAPP to the Golgi compartment is necessary before α- and β-secretase cleavages occur. Thus, although we cannot exclude a specific role for PS1 in trafficking of CTFs, these data argue against a major role in general protein trafficking. These results are more compatible with a role for PS1 either as the actual γ-secretase catalytic activity or in other functions indirectly related to γ-secretase catalysis (e.g. an activator of γ-secretase, a substrate adaptor for γ-secretase, or delivery of γ-secretase to βAPP-containing compartments).

Thus, PS1 deficiency results in accumulation of the CTFs of βAPP and a dramatic reduction in Aβ production. The mechanism by which absence of PS1 function causes loss of γ-secretase activity is unclear; but the observations that 1) mutation of two transmembrane aspartate residues in PS1 (Asp257 and Asp385) causes loss of γ-secretase cleavage; and 2) transition state aspartyl protease inhibitors, which block γ-secretase activity bind to PS1 and PS2 (16Li Y.M.

However, we have recently observed that aspartyl mutants disrupt the maturation of PS1 into high molecular weight functional complexes (19Yu G. Chen F. Nishimura M. Steiner H. Tandon A. Kawarai T.

Consequently, alternate explanations for the roles of PS1 in the processing of type 1 transmembrane proteins like βAPP and Notch must be formally evaluated (11Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X. Ginty D.D. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S.

Nature. 1999; 398: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). For instance, PS1 might be involved in the trafficking of selected substrate proteins to site(s) where γ-secretase cleavage occurs (11Naruse S. Thinakaran G. Luo J.J. Kusiak J.W. Tomita T. Iwatsubo T. Qian X. Ginty D.D. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Wong P.C. Sisodia S.S. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1213-1221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). It is also possible that PS1 serves as an adaptor for the βAPP/γ-secretase reaction or that it is necessary for the activation or trafficking of γ-secretase itself. To address these questions, we have investigated the intracellular distribution of COOH-terminal βAPP derivatives in homogenates from PS1−/− mouse brain, in cultured PS1−/−mouse neurons, and in murine fibroblasts expressing the PS1D385A loss-of-function mutation, paying particular attention to those intracellular compartments (ER, Golgi, endosome-lysosome endocytic pathway, and caveolae) previously associated with Aβ peptide generation. We have also investigated the early trafficking events that precede the accumulation of βAPP CTFs in these same tissues. Our data indicate that, in the absence of functional PS1, CTFs accumulate in a subset of the putative intracellular sites of Aβ generation (i.e. ER and Golgi, but not late endosomes). These experiments also indicate that trafficking of full-length βAPP (FL-βAPP) at least as far as the Golgi apparatus is required before βAPP-CTFs begin to accumulate. Presenilin deficiency causes no obvious abnormality in the subcellular distribution of FL-βAPP or organelle marker proteins. Mice lacking functional expression of PS1 were generated using homologous recombination to introduce a neomycin cassette flanked by loxP sequences approximately 200 base pairs downstream of exon 5 of the murine PS1 gene. When theloxP flanked neomycin cassette is not removed bycre recombinase, the presence of cryptic splice sites within the neomycin cassette results in the generation of extremely low quantities of unstable transcripts which lack an open reading frame after exon 5. 2R.

These transcripts result in no detectable PS1 protein expression in ES cells or in the brains of animals homozygous for this construct.

Brain tissue was obtained from 2-month-old PS1−/− or PS1+/+ mice and was prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (23Watt C.B. Su Y.Y.T. Lam D.M.K. J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 865-875Crossref Google Scholar). Brain pieces were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde. Vibratome sections (70–100 μm) were cut and processed with the ABC method, using the anti-βAPP COOH-terminal antibody 369. The sections were post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde overnight and in 1% osmium tetroxide for 1 h. The sections were then dehydrated, flat embedded in Epon, and polymerized. Ultrathin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed with a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope. Electron microscopic ultrastructural analysis of the biochemical membrane fractions confirmed their authenticity as described (Fig.1) (24Tjelle T.E. Brech A. Juvet L.K. Griffiths G. Berg T. J.

Brains were homogenized in 2 ml of 0.25 m sucrose in buffer A (5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and 5 μg/ml chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain), and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min. The postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was then layered on a discontinuous sucrose gradient containing four step concentrations of sucrose in buffer A (1 ml/2.0m, 3.4 ml/1.3 m, 3.4 ml/1.0 m, and 2.7 ml/0.6 m), and centrifuged at 280,000 ×g for 2 h at 4 °C (26Bole D.G.

ER and Golgi membranes were also separated in independent experiments using iodixanol gradients (28Majoul I.V. Bastiaens P.I.H. Soling H.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 777-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Brain tissue was homogenized in 1.5 ml of buffer (130 mm KCl, 25 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4), and spun for 10 min at 1,000 × g. Supernatants were removed, spun for 10 min at 3,000 × g; layered on a step gradient consisting of 1 ml each of 30%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 12.5%, 10%, 7.5%, 5%, and 2.5% (v/v) iodixanol (Accurate) in homogenization buffer, and centrifuged at 126,000 × g for 30 min. Ten fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Early and late endosome fractions were separated on a flotation gradient (29Gorvel J.-P. Chavier P. Zerial M. Gruenberg J. Cell. 1991; 64: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). After homogenization in 0.25 m sucrose in buffer A, the PNS was brought to 40.6% sucrose (final volume, 2.0 ml) and loaded at the bottom of a gradient consisting of 4 ml of 16% sucrose in buffer B containing 3 mm imidazole in D2O (pH 7.4), 3 ml of 10% sucrose in buffer B, and 1 ml of homogenization buffer. The gradient was centrifuged at 160,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. The early and late endosomal fractions were collected at the 16%/10% sucrose interface and the uppermost portion of the 10% sucrose cushion, respectively. Lysosomes and mitochondria were fractionated by two sequential density gradients (30Haass C. Koo E.H. Mellon A. Hung A.Y. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Initially, the PNS was loaded on a hybrid Percoll/metrizamide gradient, and centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 15 min. Mitochondria were collected from the 17%/35% metrizamide interface. The 6% Percoll/17% metrizamide interface was removed, adjusted to 35%, and placed at the bottom of the second gradient. After further centrifugation at 50,500 × gfor 15 min, the lysosomes were collected from the 5%/17% metrizamide interface.

For detergent-free purification, the tissues were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and homogenized in 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11.0. The homogenate was adjusted to 45% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 90% sucrose prepared in buffer C (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mmNaCl) and placed at the bottom of a 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient (4 ml of 5% sucrose, 4 ml of 35% sucrose; both in buffer C containing 250 mm sodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 275,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. The pellet from each fraction was diluted 10-fold in buffer C containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer. For detergent purification, the tissues were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and homogenized in 2 ml of buffer C with 1% Triton X-100 and 5 μg/ml chymostatin, pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain. The homogenate was adjusted to 40% sucrose by addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose in buffer C, placed under 8 ml of a linear 5–30% sucrose gradient in buffer C containing protease inhibitors as above, but lacking Triton X-100. The gradients were centrifuged, fractions were collected, and an aliquot of each fraction was used for immunoblotting. Caveolae were also purified by the immuno-isolation method previously described (35Stan R.-V. Roberts W.G. Predescu D. Ihida K. Saucan L. Ghitescu L. Palade G.E. Mol. Biol.

However, βAPP-CTFs were inconsistently present in flotillin fractions when prepared by different methods, thus precluding any reliable conclusions (data not shown). These experiments were therefore not pursued further. The proteins in each fraction were precipitated, dissolved in SDS sample buffer, and separated on 10–20% Tris-Tricine polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex) for βAPP-CTF and FL-βAPP, and on Tris-glycine gels for PS1-NTF, PS1-CTF, and marker proteins. After transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (pore size, 0.1 μm; Millipore), Western blots were probed with antibodies to βAPP-CTF and FL-βAPP (antibody 369), PS1-NTF (antibody 14), and PS1-CTF (polyclonal antibody 1143). Marker proteins for specific organelles were detected by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with the appropriate antibodies for the ER (calnexin, Stressgene), Golgi (Rab6, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; β-COP, Sigma), trans-Golgi network (TGN)-to-plasma membrane transport vesicles (Rab8, Transduction Laboratories), lysosomes (cathepsin D, Biodesign), endosomes (Rab9 and Rab7, gift from Dr. S.

Cells were plated in minimal essential medium (with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5% glucose, and 25 mm KCl) on poly-d-lysine-coated plastic 60-mm2 dishes. 4 μm cytosine arabinoside was added 18 h after plating. Cultures were ∼95% neuronal, as indicated by immunostaining with neuron-specific enolase. After 7–9 days in culture, neurons were pre-incubated for 1 h in methionine-free and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm KCl with or without brefeldin A (BFA; 2 μg/ml, Sigma) or nocodazole (NCZ; 10 or 30 μg/ml, Sigma). 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-labeling reagent (ICN) was added for 2 h, and then the media were replaced with unlabeled conditioned medium for 4 h at 37 °C. In temperature block experiments, cells were pre-incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium at 16 °C for 45 min before the addition of Tran35S-labeling reagent. Metabolic labeling continued at the respective temperature for 2 h, followed by a chase for 4 h in conditioned minimal essential medium at 16 °C or 37 °C. Cells were washed in cold PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) on ice for 30 min. The lysates were spun at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and the FL-βAPP and α- and β-CTFs were immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal antibody 369 and analyzed by 10–20% Tris-Tricine SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Novex). Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak Biomax film, and the intensities of autoradiographic bands were measured by densitometry, corrected for the moles of methionine and cysteine residues per mole of FL-βAPP or βAPP-CTFs, and the data were expressed as a percentage of the initially labeled FL-βAPP at t = 0. For secreted βAPP and Aβ immunoprecipitations, culture media were collected and immunoprecipitated using monoclonal antibodies 5A3/1G7 and polyclonal FCA18 as described (11Naruse S. Thinakaran G.

Brains were removed from young PS1−/−mice or from non-transgenic Swiss Webster mice. Each brain was homogenized in 2% SDS/PBS buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), at 1:10 w/v ratio. The homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at room temperature. The supernatants were diluted 5-fold with 2.5% Triton X-100/PBS (to a final SDS concentration of 0.4%), and precleared by an overnight incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads. After removal of the protein A-Sepharose, ∼5 mg of brain protein was immunoprecipitated using antiserum 369. The immunoprecipitated material was collected on protein A-Sepharose beads. The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed four times with 0.1%Triton X-100/PBS buffer, once in PBS and once in nanopure water. Immunoprecipitated βAPP-CTFs on protein A beads were suspended in a microcentrifuge tube and washed three times with 1 ml of PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 10 min and twice with 1 ml of HPLC-grade water. The sample was then air-dried for 15 min and mixed with 200 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (2 mg/ml) in 50% acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid. A 20-μl aliquot was then spotted onto a hydrophobic H1 protein chip array, and mass identification was performed with a combination of 100 laser shots through each spot with a Ciphergen SELDI Protein Biology System II (PBSII). Sequence assignment of each peak was made by using PAWS software (Rockefeller University) with the default setting at mass accuracy of 1000 parts per million. Analysis of βAPP processing in brain homogenates from the PS1−/− mice showed normal amounts of N′- andO′-glycosylated full-length βAPP (Fig.2). In agreement with previous reports (10De Strooper B.

A similar increase in steady state levels of CTFs was observed in cells overexpressing the PS1D385A mutation (Fig. 2) (18Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.S. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). Aβ peptide levels were undetectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the conditioned media from the PS1−/− and the PS1D385A cells (≤0.02 ng/ml). In contrast, Aβ was easily detectable in the conditioned media of PS1+/+ cells (>0.145 ng/ml). The βAPP processing in heterozygous PS1−/+ mice was not different from that observed in PS1+/+ wild-type mice (data not shown). In order to determine the structure of the βAPP CTFs from the PS1−/− mice, brain homogenates were immunoprecipitated with anti-βAPP COOH-terminal antibodies and mass determined by SELDI-time-of-flight mass spectroscopy using a Ciphergen ProteinChip system. Five major APP CTFs, with mass values of 7604.4, 7639.5, 8902.4, 8977.6, and 9874.4 Da, were detected in the PS−/−brain homogenates (Fig. 3 and TableI). The 9874.4-Da peak represents the major form of βAPP-CTF in the wild type brains (Fig. 3 and Table I) and is identified as βAPP-CTF E[11–98]Q (according to the numbering system of mouse βAPP-C99), which has a calculated mass of 9873.5 Da. This result is consistent with the observation that most Aβ generated by rodent neurons in culture is Aβ-(11–x) (Aβ-(11–40), Aβ-(11–42)) (37Gouras G.K. Xu H. Jovanovic J.N. Buxbaum J.D. Wang R.

https://openalex.org/W2166987408,"Deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates in the brain is a defining characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Fibrillar amyloid, found in the cores of senile plaques, is surrounded by dystrophic neurites. In contrast, the amorphous Aβ (also called preamyloid) in diffuse plaques is not associated with neurodegeneration. Depending on the conditions, Aβ will also form fibrillar or amorphous aggregates in vitro. In this present study, we sought to characterize the properties of the amorphous aggregate and determine whether we could establish an in vitro model for amorphous Aβ. CD data indicated that Aβ40 assembled to form either a β-structured aggregate or an unfolded aggregate with the structured aggregate forming at high peptide concentrations and the unstructured aggregate forming at low Aβ40 levels. The critical concentration separating these two pathways was 10 μm. Fluorescence emission and polarization showed the structured aggregate was tightly packed containing peptides that were not accessible to water. Peptides in the unstructured aggregate were loosely packed, mobile, and accessible to water. When examined by electron microscopy, the structured aggregate appeared as protofibrillar structures and formed classic amyloid fibrils over a period of several weeks. The unstructured aggregate was not visible by electron microscopy and did not generate fibrils. These findings suggest that the unstructured aggregate shares many properties with the amorphous Aβ of AD and that conditions can be established to form amorphous Aβ in vitro.

Although the precise nature of the relationship between this 39–43-residue peptide and neurodegeneration is still under investigation, a growing body of evidence supports the idea that Aβ plays a primary causal role in the progression of the disease (1Pike C.J.

Aβ assembles in a nucleation-dependent process to form intermediate protofibrils and ultimately fibrils 60–90 Å in diameter (7Jarrett J.T. Lansbury P.J.

Staining with Congo red and examination under polarized light produces green birefringence (10Puchtler H. Sweat F. Levine M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1962; 10: 355-364Crossref Google Scholar) indicating that amyloid deposits are composed of peptide polymers with β-sheet structure. This conformational characteristic of Aβ fibrils is confirmed by x-ray diffraction analysis, which shows a cross-β-fiber diffraction pattern with a distance between polypeptide chains of 4.76 Å and a distance between sheets of 10.6 Å (11Kirschner D. Abraham C. Selkoe D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Fibrils are the main component of amyloid deposits known as senile plaques. Senile plaques are lesions 10–200 μm in diameter with a dense core of fibrillar amyloid. These plaques are surrounded by degenerating and swollen nerve terminals (12Müller-Hill B. Beyreuther K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 287-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A second type of Aβ deposit found in AD brains is known as diffuse plaques. Unlike senile plaques, diffuse plaques contain little or no fibrillar Aβ and are instead composed of amorphous Aβ (13Yamaguchi H. Nakazato Y. Hirai S. Shoji M. Harigaya Y. Am. J. Pathol. 1989; 135: 593-597PubMed Google Scholar). Amorphous Aβ is noncongophillic and is only visible by immunocytochemical methods, suggesting that these deposits lack the ordered β-sheet secondary structure responsible for tinctoral and optical properties of fibrillar amyloid. Diffuse plaques are not surrounded by dystrophic neurites and are not associated with neurodegeneration. It has been postulated that diffuse plaques are precursors to senile plaques and hence amorphous Aβ has also been called “preamyloid.” Support for this idea comes from studies with Down's syndrome. Patients with this disorder have three copies of chromosome 21 and exhibit extensive Aβ deposition in their brains (14Wisniewski K.E. Dalton A.J. McLachlan C. Wen G.Y. Wisniewski H.M. Neurology. 1985; 35: 957-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There appears to be an age-dependent progression from the amorphous Aβ deposits found in the brains of young Down's syndrome subjects to the formation of senile plaques by adulthood (15Giaccone G. Tagliavini F. Linoli G. Bouras C. Frigerio L. Frangione B. Bugiani O. Neurosci. Lett. 1989; 97: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar,16Mann D.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 1989; 10: 397-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). If amorphous Aβ is the progenitor of Aβ fibrils, then it would be of particular usefulness to know what factors drive the conversion from the benign amorphous Aβ of diffuse plaques to the toxic fibrillar amyloid of senile plaques. An important early step in gaining this information would be the establishment of in vitroconditions to form amorphous Aβ aggregates. Aβ fibrillogenesis is a nucleation-dependent process that can be significantly affected by the presence of small peptide aggregates acting as “seeds” (17Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y.

Yip C.M. Huang T.H.J. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32970-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We ask the question: could these in vitroaggregates be the amorphous Aβ in diffuse plaques? To answer this question it was important to identify the means by which amorphous Aβ could be recognized. What characteristics distinguish amorphous Aβ from fibrillar amyloid? Although the conformation of Aβ in diffuse plaques is not known, it is likely unstructured. This provides a basis for devising an experimental plan to study amorphous Aβ in vitro. In the present study, we have developed a systematic methodology for identifying diffuse amyloid. Sedimentation was used to determine the aggregation state of Aβ. Subsequently, CD spectroscopy, fluorescence emission, and fluorescence polarization were employed to elucidate the intramolecular and intermolecular structural characteristics of peptides within the aggregates. Finally, the gross morphology of the aggregates was visualized using electron microscopy. Aggregation is a multi-molecular association reaction and is therefore concentration-dependent. In these experiments, concentration was varied to see how peptide concentration influences Aβ self-association. If we are able to establish in vitro conditions for amorphous Aβ formation, then the methods used here will allow for investigation into the aggregational and secondary structural characteristics of the alternate aggregation pathways of Aβ. These findings will provide a better understanding of the fibril formation process and may have implications in understanding the relationship between diffuse amyloid and amyloid fibrils. Peptides were prepared by solid phase synthesis on a PerSeptive Biosystems 9050 Plus peptide synthesizer, as peptide amides using PAL-PEG-PS resin (PerSeptive Biosystems). An active ester coupling procedure, employingO-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate of 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl amino acids was used. The peptides were cleaved from the resin with 81:13:1:5 trifluoroacetic acid:thioanisole:m-cresol: ethanedithiol mixture. After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the resin was removed by filtration, and bromotrimethylsilane was added to a final concentration of 12.5% (v/v). After incubation for 5 h at 0 °C, the peptides were precipitated and washed in cold ether and purified by HPLC. Peptide purity and identity was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Prior to fluorescent labeling, a glycine residue was added to the N terminus of Aβ40 to act as a flexible linker between the fluorophore and peptide. 6-(N-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)hexanoic acid (NBD) (Molecular Probes) was then coupled to this extended Aβ40 sequence during peptide synthesis to create NBD-Aβ40. Peptide purity and identity was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Aβ40 and NBD-Aβ40 preparations were lyophilized then dissolved in 10% hexafluoro-2-propanol. Peptide concentration was determined by tyrosine absorbance at 275 nm (ε = 1390 cm−1m−1) (20Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar) for Aβ40 and by NBD absorbance at 480 nm (ε = 23,000 cm−1m−1) (21Chantler P.D. Szent-Gyorgyi A.G. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5440-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Absorbance measurements were made on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Lambda 3B spectrophotometer. The stock solutions were stored at −20 °C until required. During the course of the experiments, stock peptide solutions were stored for several weeks; no changes in the behavior of these peptides were observed over this time. Negatively stained fibrils were prepared by floating charged pioloform, carbon-coated grids on peptide solutions. These solutions were incubated for 8 weeks. To control pH, the peptide solutions were made using a 25 mm phosphate buffer. After the grids were blotted and air-dried, the samples were stained with 1% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid. Platinum/carbon shadowing was performed using the glycerol spray method (19Huang T.H.J. Yang D.-S Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Solutions containing Aβ40 were brought to 30–50% (v/v) glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica, and freeze-dried. The preparations were shadowed on an Edwards E12E4 coater with platinum/carbon (15–20 Å) at an angle of 5–7° followed by an additional 30–40 Å of carbon-coating applied at an angle of 90°. Film deposition was measured with a Balzers QSE201 quartz crystal monitor. The platinum/carbon replicants were floated off in distilled water and placed onto 300-mesh copper grids. Representative electron microscopy images of the peptide assemblies were acquired on a Hitachi H-7000 TEM operated with an accelerating voltage of 75 kV. Steady-state fluorescence was measured at room temperature using a Photon Technology International QM-1 fluorescence spectrophotometer equipped with excitation intensity correction and a magnetic stirrer. For measurements of NBD fluorescence, emission spectra from 500 to 600 nm were collected (λex = 470 nm, averaging time = 0.1 or 1 s, 1-nm steps, bandpass = 4 nm for excitation and emission). A quartz cuvette with 1-cm path length and 0.5-ml volume was used. Spectra of samples containing only unlabeled Aβ40 were used to correct for light scattering. Samples were prepared with a fixed concentration of 0.1 μm NBD-Aβ40 as a tracer. Stock peptides were mixed then diluted to the desired final concentrations and pH using buffer (25 mm borate, 25 mm citrate, and 25 mmphosphate). After dilution, the pH was again measured and readjusted, if necessary, and then all samples were incubated 18–24 h prior to spectral acquisition. For steady-state polarization experiments, the fluorescence spectrophotometer was configured in the L format, and samples of NBD-Aβ40 and free NBD were excited at 478 nm. The intensities (I) of the vertical (v) and horizontal (h) components of emission at 530 nm were measured. Fluorescence polarization (p) was calculated according to the equation, p = (I vv −GI vh)/(I vv +GI vh) where first and second subscripts refer to the positions of the excitation and emission polarizers, respectively, and G =I hv/I hh. G is the factor used to correct for detection differences between vertically and horizontally polarized light. A concentration series of Aβ40 was prepared (0.75, 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 mm Aβ40 with 0.1 μm NBD-Aβ40, 25 mm phosphate, pH 7.0), and the fluorescence polarization of the samples was measured. CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv Circular Dichroism Spectrometer model 62DS at 25 °C. Spectra were obtained from 200 to 300 nm (0.5-cm path length, 0.5-nm steps, and 1-nm bandwidth) on a sample containing 20 μm Aβ40 in buffer (7.5 mm borate, 7.5 mm citrate, and 7.5 mm phosphate). For the experiments we chose to use the 40-residue form of Aβ (Aβ40). This synthetic peptide was HPLC purified, but no attempt was made to remove aggregates or fibril seeds that may have been present. Aβ40 contains no intrinsic fluorophores; thus, it was necessary to introduce an extrinsic fluorescent molecule. This was accomplished by attaching the environment-sensitive fluorophore, NBD, to the N terminus of Aβ40 via two glycine residues. These glycines act as a flexible linker to prevent any adverse steric effects that may have been exerted by NBD. This labeled molecule, NBD-Aβ40, was then added as a tracer to samples made with Aβ40. This approach has the distinct advantage that most of the peptide would be wild type, whereas only a tiny component would be the engineered molecule. Samples with fixed tracer amounts of labeled peptide (0.1 μm NBD-Aβ40) and increasing concentrations of unlabeled peptide (were prepared at pH 7 and allowed to incubate overnight. Sedimentation by centrifugation was used to test for the formation of Aβ40 aggregates. The absorbance of NBD at 490 nm was measured before centrifugation (Fig. 1). The samples were then centrifuged, and the NBD absorbance was measured again. After centrifugation little if any NBD absorbance remained at all concentrations. Thus, sedimentable aggregates formed at all peptide concentrations. It was possible to pellet the aggregate in a table top centrifuge set at 15,600 × g, a relatively slow speed. This suggested that the aggregates were large. Furthermore, because nearly all absorbance was lost, most of the Aβ40 had aggregated into an insoluble form, and only a small fraction of the peptide remained in solution. The tinctoral properties of amyloid suggest that fibrillar amyloid has ordered structure, whereas amorphous Aβ does not. To see whether there were any differences in secondary structure among the amyloid preparations, CD spectroscopy was used (Fig. 2). The spectrum at lowest peptide concentration (8.7 μm) was representative of an unfolded conformation. Because the sedimentation data showed that most of the Aβ40 is aggregated at this concentration, this suggested that it is the aggregates which were unstructured. At 17.1 μm the spectrum showed characteristics that were representative of β-structure: a positive band around 200 nm and a negative band at 218 nm. By 25.2 μm these bands were quite pronounced. The amount of β-structure content of Aβ40 aggregates reached a maximum by 40.8 μm. Thus, β-structure evolved as the total peptide concentration increased. Light scattering because of the presence of aggregated material can often confound the interpretation of CD spectra. Because most of the peptide in these samples was aggregated, this could have been a significant problem. However, the spectra here closely resembled CD spectra of unfolded and β-sheet conformations. In this case, we are confident light scattering effects have not adversely influenced the results. Thus, Aβ40 formed aggregates at all concentrations tested and there were two distinct types; at low concentration, Aβ40 associated to form unstructured aggregates, whereas at high concentrations, Aβ40 associated to form β-structure aggregates. In diffuse plaques, amyloid appears wispy and noncompacted, whereas senile plaques appear dense and fibrillar. These morphological characteristics suggest that constituent peptides may have different solvent accessibility depending on whether they are present in diffuse amyloid or fibrillar amyloid. To see whether similar situation existed with our in vitro amyloid, we looked at solvent accessibility using NBD as our representative side chain. NBD, having a similar size and shape to Trp, could be accepted into the aggregate/fibril like other aromatic amino acids. Once introduced into Aβ40, any effects of solvent accessibility will act on NBD as with other residues in the sequence with the advantage that any changes would be reported by the fluorescence characteristics of the fluorophore. The fluorescence of NBD is quenched by water. When NBD-Aβ40 is not assembled, NBD is accessible to water. NBD fluorescence would be quenched, and fluorescence emission in the sample would be low. When Aβ40 assembles, water would be excluded and quenching would be reduced so fluorescence increases. If there were a further conformational change that results in a more compact structure and further sequesters NBD from water, then fluorescence would be further enhanced. Again a fixed tracer amount of NBD-Aβ40 was used in conjunction with an increasing amount of unlabeled Aβ40. With more Aβ40 there was increased fluorescence emission, suggesting that solvent accessibility decreased with increasing concentration (Fig.3). This change indicated that the aggregate at low concentration was different from the aggregate that formed at high concentration or, specifically, that Aβ40 aggregates condensed with increasing concentration to form more compact structures that effectively sequestered NBD from quenching by water. If there were no change in structure, then the fluorescence would have remained flat throughout the concentrations. Centrifugation of the samples and measurement of fluorescence produced results identical to those from the absorbance measurements. Nearly all the fluorescence in each sample was lost after centrifugation. This confirmed that large sedimentable aggregates formed at all concentrations. Furthermore, that most fluorescence was lost indicated the majority of peptide aggregated, and only a small fraction of Aβ40 comprised the soluble component. The evidence accumulated thus far supported the idea that we were producing in vitro versions of diffuse and fibrillar amyloid as these aggregates shared properties with in vivo AD amyloid. The increase in fluorescence was consistent with formation of noncompact structures at low peptide concentration and evolution of tightly packed water excluding structures as protofibrils or fibrils formed with increasing peptide amounts. The mobility of side chains would be further information as to how tightly packed the peptides are in one aggregate type versus another. Another property of fluorescence, fluorescence polarization, can be used to investigate this. If a fluorophore is excited by polarized light, then the emitted light will also be polarized. The fluorophore will move during the time delay between excitation and emission, and this movement will result in the depolarization of the emitted light relative to the excitation light. The degree of depolarization is dependent on the rotational relaxation time; the greater the rate of rotation, the lower its polarization. In our system, two motions will affect the polarization of the fluorescence emission: global motions and local motions. Any changes in global motions would give information on the aggregation state of NBD-Aβ40, whereas changes in local motions would provide information on the packing state of our representative side chain NBD The polarization of free NBD was first measured (Fig.4). This value was relatively low, 0.32, because it is a small molecule and has a short rotational relaxation time. However, once attached to Aβ40, a much larger molecule, its movement was more restricted, and the measured polarization was higher. Polarization increased up to 10 μm then stabilized. The 10 μm Aβ40 concentration may mark a transition between two states. We knew that large aggregates formed at all concentrations; it was unlikely then that the change in polarization was due to global motion changes. Rather, it was more likely that the local motions of NBD were the cause. Thus, above 10 μm, NBD was contained within the β-structure aggregate and was tightly packed and not free to move. 10 μm seems to be critical concentration dividing the conversion between two aggregate types. Aβ formed two distinct aggregate types: an unstructured aggregate and the β-structured aggregate. Not only is the unstructured aggregate lacking regular secondary structure, but also its conformation is looser, solvent exposed, and its constituent peptides are not as tightly associated. On the other hand, the peptides in the β-structured aggregate showed β-sheet secondary structure, were tightly packed, and excluded water from their side chain environments. These in vitro aggregates appeared to share many properties with in vivo amyloid forms. As a final step, we attempted to visualize the morphology of the aggregates by employing electron microscopy. Aβ40 preparations were examined by either platinum/carbon shadowing electron microscopy or negative stain electron microscopy. At 0.1 μm NBD-Aβ40 and 5 μm Aβ40 (Fig.5 A), a concentration that exhibited aggregate formation but no ordered secondary structure, only a few small spherical structures were present. Although we know that the unstructured aggregate was forming at this concentration, they were not visible by this technique. As the peptide concentration was raised (0.1 μm NBD-Aβ40 and 50 μm Aβ40; Fig.5 B), these structures became abundant; moreover, the spherical aggregates seemed to assemble into clusters and elongated aggregates similar to protofibrils. Because CD showed that β-structure evolved with concentration, we concluded that these protofibrils were the β-structure aggregate. After 8 weeks of incubation, the high concentration Aβ40 sample (0.1 μmNBD-Aβ40 and 48 μm Aβ40, Fig. 5 C) had taken on the morphology of classic amyloid fibrils. In the search to identify the neurotoxic species of Aβ in AD, amorphous Aβ has been ignored as a subject of investigation because diffuse plaques are not associated with neurodegeneration. However, it is clear that amorphous Aβ is an important component of the total amyloid load in the AD brain, and therefore, its properties should be better understood. Previous studies have emphasized the importance of ensuring that preparations of Aβ are seed-free in generating Aβ fibrils rather than nonspecific aggregates (17Walsh D.M. Hartley D.M. Kusumoto Y. Fezoui Y. Condron M.M. Lomakin A. Benedek G.B. Selkoe D.J. Teplow D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25945-25952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). We reported previously that peptide stocks that have been carefully pretreated to remove seeds generated soluble oligomeric structures that formed prior to fibrillar amyloid (19Huang T.H.J. Yang D.-S Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We also observed that Aβ40 preparations where seeds have not been removed formed amorphous aggregates (18Yang D.-S. Yip C.M. Huang T.H.J. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32970-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have found that these samples may provide a useful in vitro system for studying in vivo amorphous Aβ. Many of the experiments make use of Aβ40 labeled with the fluorescent probe NBD. The behavior of NBD-Aβ40 appears to be comparable with that of Aβ40 itself. We have reported previously that NBD-Aβ40 has similar solubility characteristics (18Yang D.-S. Yip C.M. Huang T.H.J. Chakrabartty A. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32970-32974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Furthermore, under defined conditions, Aβ40 labeled with NBD as well as other fluorescent probes, Trp or 5-acetylethyldiaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid, self-associates to form oligomeric structures like unlabeled Aβ40 (19Huang T.H.J. Yang D.-S Plaskos N.P. Go S. Yip C.M. Fraser P.E. Chakrabartty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). As a final precaution, to reduce the possibility of the fluorophore affecting the behavior of Aβ40, labeled peptide has been used in tracer amounts. There are at least two different aggregation pathways for Aβ40: one leading to a β-structure aggregate and the other to an unstructured aggregate. The β-structured aggregate is composed of tightly packed Aβ40 peptides that have β-sheet secondary structure and may be the protofibril precursor to Aβ fibrils. The unstructured aggregate lacks regular secondary structure, its constituent peptides are not tightly associated, and its conformation is looser with the side chain solvent exposed. The unstructured aggregate shares many properties with the diffuse amyloid in AD. Whether Aβ40 associates to form the unstructured aggregate or fibrils is determined by the total peptide concentration. The critical concentration separating these two pathways is 10 μm. A possible explanation for why the more compact and ordered fibrils form at higher concentration is that the nucleus for fibril formation is stable only at peptide concentrations above 10 μm. It has been suggested that there is a time-dependent relationship between amorphous Aβ and fibrillar amyloid where diffuse amyloid is the precursor to fibril formation. Our results show this relationship may not only be one of time but rather one that is also based on concentration. Some mutations associated with AD increase Aβ concentration. This would have the effect of shifting the aggregation pathway to favor formation of β-structured aggregate and hence Aβ fibrils. If fibrils are toxic it would be critical to prevent this step from taking place. A treatment strategy is to reduce Aβ concentration below the critical concentration for conversion to fibrils and thereby maintain amyloid in the non-neurotoxic amorphous form making it unnecessary to completely eliminate Aβ. It would be useful to examine whether amorphous and fibrillar Aβ directly interconvert, that is, once amorphous Aβ is formed does it convert to fibrillar amyloid? Solid to solid transitions are rare and require extreme conditions such as high pressure in the case of coal-graphite-diamond conversion. It is unlikely that a such a transition is taking place in vivo. A more plausible mechanism is that Aβ monomers are the intermediate between these two aggregates. An understanding of this interconversion would be necessary to evaluate whether reducing peptide concentration to control the aggregation pathway would be sufficient to prevent AD pathogenesis. Alternatively, the aggregation of Aβ into amorphous may generate, by chance, nucleation sites from which structured fibrils can grow with the addition of monomeric Aβ. The present study indicates that concentration is an important factor influencing amyloid morphology; however, the precise mechanisms driving conversion will have to be determined in future experiments. The methodology used in this study can be deployed to test drugs. Fluorescence techniques can be utilized as a preliminary screen for potential drugs that prevent formation of β-structured aggregates. Subsequently, CD spectroscopy can be applied for confirmation.

Soc. 1999; 121: 1756-1757Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) as deduced previously for the uncatalyzed rearrangement (3Addadi L. Jaffe E.K. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 4494-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 4Gajewski J.J. Jurayj J. Kimbrough D.R. Gande M.E. Ganem B. Carpenter B.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1987; 109: 1170-1186Crossref Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the magnitude of the observed isotope effect suggests that the transition state of the enzyme-catalyzed process is more highly polarized than that of the uncatalyzed reaction (22Gustin D.J. Mattei P. Kast P. Wiest O. Lee L. Cleland W.W. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1756-1757Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Electrostatic interactions may therefore be essential for efficient catalysis (8Chook Y.M. Gray J.V. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 476-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar,23Haynes M.R. Stura E.A. Hilvert D. Wilson I.A. Science. 1994; 263: 646-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Complementarily charged active site residues could conceivably stabilize developing charges in transition state 2 (Fig.1 A). Computational studies have highlighted stabilizing interactions between the positively charged Arg at position 90 of BsCM and the partially negatively charged ether oxygen of chorismate in the transition state (17Wiest O. Houk K.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 11628-11639Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 18Lyne P.D. Mulholland A.J. Richards W.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 11345-11350Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Davidson M.M. Gould I.R. Hillier I.H. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. I. 1996; 2: 525-531Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In previous work, we addressed the hypothesis of electrostatic catalysis by combinatorial mutagenesis experiments (25Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 26Kast P. Hartgerink J.D. Asif-Ullah M. Hilvert D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 3069-3070Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An evolutionary approach was employed consisting of randomizing critical positions in the active site of BsCM combined with direct genetic selection for mutant genes encoding functional catalysts. From the spectrum of active BsCM mutants obtained it was obvious that survival of host cells under selective conditions was only possible for variants with a positively charged group in the region of the ether oxygen of bound chorismate (25Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here, we report detailed kinetic and structural characterization of several relevant mutant enzymes derived from our combinatorial libraries. The results suggest that a single cation provides the dominant catalytic interaction in the active site of chorismate mutases. Chorismic acid was prepared according to published procedures (27Grisostomi C. Kast P. Pulido R. Huynh J. Hilvert D. Bioorg. Chem. 1997; 25: 297-305Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The transition state analog for the chorismate mutase reaction, the oxabicyclic dicarboxylic acid4 of Fig. 1 B, was synthesized as described previously (28Smith W.W. Bartlett P.A. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 7308-7309Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and PfuDNA polymerase, purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), was used for polymerase chain reaction. E. coli strain KA13 (13MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10062-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,29MacBeath G. Kast P. Biotechniques. 1998; 24: 789-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used for the construction of the aroH expression plasmids as well as for BsCM protein production. The in vivocomplementation system KA12/pKIMP-UAUC was described previously (25Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Both KA13 and KA12 have chromosomal deletions of the endogenousE. coli chorismate mutase genes. The cloning vector pET-22b(+) was from Novagen (Madison, WI). Plasmids pKCMT-W, pKCMT-R90A, pKCMT-R90G, pKCMT-C88S/R90K, and pKCMT-C88K/R90S carrytrc promoter-expressed B. subtilis aroH gene variants encoding wild-type (WT), R90A, R90G, C88S/R90K, and C88K/R90S BsCM, respectively. pKCMT-W and the selected mutant pKCMT plasmids from two different combinatorial libraries were characterized previously (25Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). pKET3-W (21Mattei P. Kast P. Hilvert D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is a pET-22b(+) derivative that contains the WTaroH gene under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Individual mutantaroH genes were tested for their ability to complement the chorismate mutase deficiency of strain KA12 after transforming KA12/pKIMP-UAUC with the relevant pKCMT plasmids. The assay procedure involved comparing growth of single colonies on minimal medium (M9c) agar plates in the presence or absence of 20 μg/ml l-Phe and l-Tyr. M9c plates were composed of 1 × M9 salts (6 mg/ml Na2HPO4, 3 mg/ml KH2PO4, 1 mg/ml NH4Cl, 0.5 mg/ml NaCl, pH 7.0 (30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar)) supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) d-(+)-Glc, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 5 μg/ml thiamine-HCl, 5 μg/ml 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 5 μg/ml 4-aminobenzoic acid, 1.6 μg/ml 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, 20 μg/mll-Trp, 100 μg/ml sodium ampicillin, 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 15 g of agar/liter. Media and assay conditions corresponded to those used previously (25Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For high level production of mutant BsCM proteins, the corresponding aroH genes were transferred from the initialtrc promoter expression plasmids (pKCMT types) to pET-22b(+), allowing for T7 promoter-driven gene expression. ThearoH genes for C88S/R90K or C88K/R90S variants were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides T7-aroHW (5′-GGAAACAGCATATGATGATTCGCGGAATT) and TMUTN (5′-ATCAAGCGGCCGCACTAGT) using HincII-digested pKCMT-C88S/R90K or pKCMT-C88K/R90S as templates, respectively. The 414-bp polymerase chain reaction products were digested withNdeI and EagI to yield 394-bp fragments that were then ligated to the 5372-bp NdeI-EagI fragment of pET-22b(+), resulting in plasmids pKET3-C88S/R90K and pKET3-C88K/R90S. pKET3-R90A and pKET3-R90G were obtained by replacing the 343-bpEcoRI-HindIII restriction fragment in pKET3-W with the corresponding fragments from pKCMT-R90A and pKCMT-R90G, respectively. We have observed that a single silent base change in the codon for Ile3 (from ATC to ATT) caused a 3-fold increase in WT protein yield (data not shown), even though codon usage in highly expressed genes in E. coli favors ATC (83%) over ATT (17%) (according to Version 8 of the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package by Genetics Computer Group, Inc, Madison, WI). Consequently, the third codon in aroH on the pKCMT plasmids (ATC) was mutated to ATT in all pKET3 constructs. The entire aroH gene and relevant gene expression signals in the new pKET3 plasmids (5766 bp) were confirmed by sequencing both strands with primers T7PRO2 (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) and T7TER (5′-CAGCAGCCAACTCAGCT) using an ABI 373 DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with dye terminator nucleotides and chain termination chemistry (31Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). All DNA manipulations were carried out according to standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 5 ml of LB medium (30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) containing 150 μg/ml sodium ampicillin was inoculated with a single colony of E. coli strain KA13 transformed with the relevant pKET3 plasmid and incubated overnight at 37 °C. 1 liter of the same medium with 150 μg/ml sodium ampicillin was seeded with the densely grown preculture and shaken at 250 rpm at 37 °C until anA 600 nm of 0.6 was reached. Then, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added (500 μm final concentration) to induce synthesis of the chromosomally encoded T7 RNA polymerase in KA13 for expression of the T7 promoter-controlled aroH genes. The incubation was continued for another 24 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (20 min, 2,500 × g, 4 °C), and the cell pellet was stored overnight at −20 °C. The thawed cells were gently resuspended in 180 ml of osmobuffer (20% (w/v) sucrose, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 0 °C. EDTA and dithiothreitol (DTT) were added to 1 mm final concentration each. This cell suspension was shaken at room temperature for 15 min at 200 rpm followed by centrifugation (10 min, 8,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant containing the soluble protein fraction was transferred to a new centrifuge bottle and spun again to remove remaining traces of cells and debris. The clear supernatant was subsequently concentrated to 20 ml by ultrafiltration at 4 °C (200 ml ultrafiltration unit using a Diaflo YM10 membrane; Amicon, Beverly, MA). The concentrate was dialyzed twice (at 4 °C; Spectra/Por 1, cutoff 6–8 kDa; Spectrum Laboratories, Inc., Laguna Hills, CA) for at least 4 h against 1 liter of degassed buffer B (50 mmglycine-NaOH, pH 8.9, 1 mm DTT, 5% (v/v) 2-propanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol). The sample was then filtered through 0.8/0.2-μm Acrodisc PF syringe filters (Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI) to remove insoluble precipitates. The filtrate was loaded onto a diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) DE-52 cellulose anion exchange column (2.5-ml bed volume; catalog number 4057–050, Whatman Inc., Clifton, NJ) previously equilibrated in degassed buffer B. The gravity flow column was washed extensively with buffer B and then eluted with an NaCl gradient (0–300 mm) in buffer B. Fractions containing pure BsCM were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration at 4 °C using Centriprep-10 devices (Amicon). BsCM concentration was determined by UV absorption using a calculated molar extinction coefficient (per subunit: 8250 m−1cm−1). For storage, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, DTT, and NaN3 were added to give final concentrations of 0.6 mm, 10 mm and 0.02%, respectively. Purification was monitored by analyzing appropriate samples and fractions on 20% SDS polyacrylamide gels (PhastSystem, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were prepared for electrospray ionization mass spectrometry by desalting on a NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated and eluted with 5% aqueous acetic acid. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed by The Scripps Mass Spectrometry Laboratory on an API 100 PerkinElmer Life Sciences SCIEX single quadrupole mass spectrometer. Experimental results (which had an accuracy of 0.01%) were compared with theoretical protein masses calculated with the program PeptideSort (Genetics Computer Group, Inc.). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on an Aviv circular dichroism spectropolarimeter model 61DS equipped with a thermoelectric cuvette holder. BsCM samples were measured at a protein concentration of 6.7 μm (trimer) at 23 °C in phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate, 160 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) in a cuvette with a path length of 0.1 cm. Spectra were obtained by averaging 5 wavelength scans from 260 nm to 200 nm in 0.5-nm steps, with a signal averaging time of 2 s and a bandwidth of 1.5 nm. Protein for crystallization was dialyzed against a solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, and 0.125 mm EDTA. Crystallization experiments were performed at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique. The hanging drop was formed by mixing 3 μl of the protein solution (at 15–20 mg/ml) with 3 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 30% polyethylene glycol 400, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 to pH 7.5, and 50 mmMgCl2. Prism-shaped crystals with a typical size of 0.2 × 0.4 × 0.5 mm appeared after 3–6 days. The space group was determined to be R3, with cell parameters ofa = b = 82.6 Å, and c= 42.8 Å (one molecule per asymmetric unit). X-ray data extending to 1.8-Å resolution were recorded on an Raxis-IIc image plate detector mounted on a Rigaku rotating anode generator (RU200) operating at 50 kV/100 mA. Data were collected at room temperature with the crystal-to-detector distance set to 90 mm and an oscillation angle of 2°. All data were processed and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (33Otwinowski Z. DENZO: An Oscillation Data Processing Suite for Macromolecular Crystallography , Version 1.3.0. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar, 34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The final data sets include 10,748 and 9,357 unique reflections, respectively, for the mutants C88S/R90K and C88K/R90S. This corresponds to a completeness of 97.7 and 100.0% to 1.75- and 1.85-Å resolution (redundancies are 4.9 and 4.2), respectively. The respective symmetry R-factors are 6.0 and 8.5% for the two data sets. The structure of monomer A of the published wild-type protein (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 2CHT (7Chook Y.M. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8600-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8Chook Y.M. Gray J.V. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 476-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)) was used as the search model for molecular replacement. Molecular replacement was performed using X-PLOR (35Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for Crystallography and NMR , Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) and AMoRe (36Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar) in separate runs. Both programs yielded virtually the same solutions, which were verified by inspecting the resulting electron density maps. The structures were subsequently refined with X-PLOR (35Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for Crystallography and NMR , Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar, 37Brünger A.T. Kuriyan J. Karplus M. Science. 1987; 235: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (2126) Google Scholar) using torsion-angle dynamics (38Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. Proteins. 1994; 19: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). For the final rounds of refinement, data were restricted to 1.9 and 2.0 Å for the mutants C88S/R90K and C88K/R90S, respectively, because beyond that resolution, both R and R free increased dramatically, coinciding with a decrease in data quality as judged fromR sym. Model building was carried out on a molecular graphics workstation using O (39Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Superpositions of crystal structure coordinates of WT BsCM and mutant variants were performed with the program O (39Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). In all cases, 2664 peptide backbone atoms of segments encompassing residues Met2 to Ala112 of each subunit in the trimer were superimposed. For the comparisons, we selected the trimer composed of subunits J, K, and L from the asymmetric units of the WT structure complexed with 4 (7Chook Y.M. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8600-8603Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 8Chook Y.M. Gray J.V. Ke H. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 476-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and crystallographic trimers of the BsCM mutants. 2The atomic coordinates for WT BsCM in a complex with inhibitor 4 (PDB code 2CHT) were from the Protein Data Bank. The coordinates for unliganded C88S/R90K and C88K/R90S can be accessed under PDB codes 1FNJ and 1FNK, respectively. Kinetic assays were carried out at 30 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, by monitoring the disappearance of the substrate chorismate at 274 nm (ε274 nm = 2630 m−1cm−1) or 310 nm (ε310 nm = 370m−1 cm−1) by UV spectroscopy. All curve fittings of initial velocity data were done with the program KaleidaGraph (version 3.08; Synergy Software, Reading, PA). For determination of Michaelis-Menten parametersk cat (per active site) andK m, substrate concentrations up to 5.7 mm were used. K i for competitive inhibition of WT BsCM by transition state analog 4 was determined by fitting initial velocities obtained at 36 μm chorismate and nine different concentrations of inhibitor (0 to 100 μm) to the equation v= (k cat[E0][S])/([S] +K m(1 + [I]/K i)) (40Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York, NY1985: 107-109Google Scholar). For inhibition studies with C88K/R90S and C88S/R90K, concentrations up to 1 mm of 4 were used at a single chorismate concentration of 75 μm. The K i value for R90G was estimated from a replot of the slopes of a Dixon plot obtained by varying inhibitor concentrations (0 to 30 μm) at four fixed chorismate concentrations between 48 and 126 μm. Previous in vivo studies of mutant BsCM genes indicated that a positively charged amino acid side chain at position 90 or 88 is a prerequisite for detectable chorismate mutase activity (25Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5043-5048Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To assess and quantify the role of this cation for the enzymatic mechanism, we have examined several BsCM variants in greater detail. The corresponding aroH genes were taken from our collection of mutants generated for the combinatorial mutagenesis and selection experiments (25Kast P. Asif-Ullah M. Jiang N. Hilvert D. Proc. Natl.

The hemocyanin of the tarantula Eurypelma californicum is a 24-mer protein complex with molecular mass of 1,726,459 Da that consists of seven different polypeptides (a–g), each occupying a distinct position within the native molecule. Here we report the complete molecular structure of the E. californicumhemocyanin as deduced from the corresponding cDNAs. This represents the first complex arthropod hemocyanin to be completely sequenced. The different subunits display 52–66% amino acid sequence identity. Within the subunits, the central domain, which bears the active center with the copper-binding sites A and B, displays the highest degree of identity. Using a homology modeling approach, the putative three-dimensional structure of individual subunits was deduced and compared. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that differentiation of the individual subunits occurred 400–550 million years ago. The hemocyanin of the stemline Chelicerata was probably a hexamer built up of six distinct subunit types a, b/c, d,e, f, and g, whereas that of the early Arachnida was originally a 24-mer that emerged after the differentiation of subunits b and c.

They are freely dissolved in the hemolymph of arthropods and molluscs and constitute the predominant group of hemolymph proteins in these taxa. Arthropod and mollusc hemocyanins differ substantially concerning subunit size, composition, quaternary structure, and evolutionary origin (1Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ.

Despite these marked differences, oxygen binding by hemocyanins of both phyla is mediated by a pair of copper atoms that are coordinated by six histidine residues (2van Holde K.E. Miller K.I. Adv.

These proteins are composed of heterogeneous subunits in the 75-kDa range that combine to form either a regular cubic single hexamer (1 × 6) or multiple hexamers (2–8 × 6), depending upon the species or physiological conditions (5Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). Full biological activity requires a specific arrangement of the hexamers within the native complex and that each subunit type occupies a distinct position within the hexamer (6Markl J. Kempter B.

In addition, detailed structural models of hemocyanin subunits from the CrustaceaPanulirus interruptus (12Gaykema W.P.J. Hol W.G.J. Vereifken J.M. Soeter N.M. Bak H.J. Beintema J.J.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 597-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) have been established based on x-ray diffraction studies. Each hemocyanin subunit is folded into three domains with a highly conserved central domain 2 providing the binuclear copper site (CuA, CuB) for binding one oxygen molecule, N-terminal domain 1, and C-terminal domain 3, which are both less stringently conserved among arthropod hemocyanins (9Linzen B.

Moreover, analysis of the exon/intron architecture of one hemocyanin gene supports the proposed protein domain structure (15Voll W. Voit R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5312-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The hemocyanin of the North American tarantula Eurypelma californicum is a native 24-mer protein complex consisting of two identical dodecamers with an estimated total molecular mass of about 1800 kDa (5Markl J.

Formation of the 24-mer complex requires the aggregation of seven different subunit types in a constant stochiometric amount with four copies each of subunits a,d, e, f, and g, and two copies of subunit b and c (5Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar, 19Markl J. Decker H. Stocker W. Savel A. Linzen B. Schutter W.G. van Bruggen E.F. Hoppe-Seyler's Z.

To understand how structural differentiation and adaptive evolution led to individual subunits obtaining distinct roles requires analysis of the whole primary structure. Here we report the cDNA cloning of subunitsb, c, d, f, andg. The availability of the deduced sequence data, together with previously identified a, d, and esubunits, have permitted us to investigate the intra-molecular evolution of the tarantula hemocyanin and to build a three-dimensional model of the 24-mer protein. The tarantula E. californicum was purchased from Carolina Biological Supply. Animals were kept under standard conditions as described (27Loewe R. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1973; 324: 182-188Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Total RNA was prepared from E. californicum hearts following induction of hemopoiesis as described before (26Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19447-19452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligo(dT)-primed cDNA libraries were established in phage λgt10 and probed with two degenerate oligonucleotides designed according to the highly conserved amino acid sequences of CuA (HHWHWH)- and CuB (HNWGHV)-binding sites ofE. californicum hemocyanin subunits a ande (26Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19447-19452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cDNAs of positive clones were cloned into pUC19 or pBluescript, and sequenced. Missing 5′-terminal regions of the cDNAs were obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 1 μg of E. californicumheart total RNA and three nested oligonucleotide primers specific for each subunit. Sequences were obtained either directly from the polymerase chain reaction products or after cloning into the vector pGEMTeasy (Promega). The programs provided by the Software Package 8.0 from the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) were used for sequence analysis. Sequences were aligned using PILEUP and imported into GeneDoc 2.5 for further manipulation. The alignment is available from the authors upon request. The PHYLIP 3.6 software package was used for phylogenetic analyses (29Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar). Distances between pairs of protein sequences were calculated and corrected for multiple changes according to Dayhoff's empirical PAM 001 matrix (30Dayhoff M.O. Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure , Vol. 5, Supplement 3. National Biomedical Research Foundation, Washington, D.C.1979Google Scholar) with the PROTDIST program. Phylogenetic trees were constructed either by the neighbor joining method or the maximum parsimony method implemented in the PROTPARS program. The reliability of the trees was tested by bootstrap analysis (31Felsenstein J. Evolution. 1985; 39: 783-791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 100 replications (SEQBOOT program). To estimate the divergence times, the PAM matrix was imported into the Microsoft EXCEL 97 spreadsheet program (32Burmester T. Massey Jr., H.C. Zakharkin S.O. Beneš H. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 47: 93-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A linearized tree that corresponds to the phylogeny of the chelicerate hemocyanins was calculated on the basis that Merestomata and Arachnida separated about 450 MYA1 (33Dunlop, J. A., and Selden, P. A. (1997) Arthropod Relationships (Fortey, R. A., and Thomas, R. H., eds) pp. 221–236, Systematic Association Special Volume Series 55, Chapman and Hall, London.Google Scholar). The confidence limits were estimated using the observed standard deviation of the protein distances. Homology models of the subunits were built on the basis of the three-dimensional structure of L. polyphemus hemocyanin subunit II (Protein Data Bank entry 1LLA; Ref. 14Hazes B. Magnus K.A.

A tentative model of the four-hexamer hemocyanin was composed using the distances, angles, and other parameters as deduced from electron microscopic studies ofE. californicum hemocyanin (7Decker H. Hartmann H. Sterner R. Schwarz E. Pilz I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The spatial arrangement of the seven subunit types was performed on the basis of immunoelectron microscopy studies and reassembly experiments (6Markl J. Kempter B. Linzen B. Bijlholt M.M. van Bruggen E.F. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 1364-1631Google Scholar, 37Markl J. Decker H. Linzen B. Schutter W.G. von Bruggen E.F. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1982; 363: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the tarantulaE. californicum, hemocyanin is synthesized in hemocytes attached to the inner heart wall, and hemopoiesis is markedly induced after bleeding (38Kempter B. Naturwissenschaften. 1983; 70: 255-256Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To establish cDNA libraries enriched for hemocyanin mRNA, total RNA was prepared from tarantulas that had been bled 5 days before RNA isolation (26Voit R. Feldmaier-Fuchs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19447-19452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From this RNA a cDNA library containing 5.4 × 105 independent clones was constructed in phage λgt10. To identify hemocyanin-specific cDNAs, degenerate oligonucleotide probes were used for screening that were derived from the amino acid sequence of the CuA- and CuB-binding sites. These sites are known to be most highly conserved among several heterogeneous hemocyanin subunits of different arthropods (9Linzen B. Soeter N.M. Riggs A.F. Schneider H.J. Schartau W.

Sequence analysis revealed that these cDNAs contained open reading frames coding for seven different polypeptides each encompassing the CuA- and CuB-binding sites. 11 of 36 cDNAs were found to code for the known hemocyanin subunits a (24Schartau W.

Because all these cDNAs represented N-terminally truncated versions missing between 30 and 500 base pairs at the 5′ end, the corresponding full-length cDNAs were obtained by a polymerase chain reaction-based approach. The sequences of the full-length cDNAs have been deposited in the EMBL/GenBankTM data base (TableI).Table IMolecular properties of the E. californicum hemocyanin subunitsSubunitAccession number 1-aEMBL/GenBank™ DNA data accession number.cDNA 1-bWithout poly(A) tail.Protein 1-cIncluding the initiator methionine.Molecular mass 1-dWithout initiator methinine.pI 1-dWithout initiator methinine.bpamino acidskDaaX16893211063172.195.57bAJ290429214462771.975.76cAJ277489217462972.445.66dAJ290430204262771.995.87eX16894219262471.545.44fAJ277491206062972.025.73gAJ277492208862971.685.711-a EMBL/GenBank™ DNA data accession number.1-b Without poly(A) tail.1-c Including the initiator methionine.1-d Without initiator methinine.

The open reading frames translate into polypeptides of 624 to 631 amino acids with calculated molecular masses ranging from 71.5 to 72.4 kDa (Table I). This corresponds well with the apparent molecular mass of 67–76 kDa (17Markl J. Markl A. Schartau W. Linzen B. J. Comp. Physiol. 1979; 130: 283-292Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In total, the 24-mer hemocyanin acquires a total molecular mass of 1,726,459 Da. The aligned complete amino acid sequences are presented in Fig. 1. Pairwise sequence comparison of single subunits revealed that 52–65% of amino acid positions are identical. 202 amino acids (32%) are strictly conserved throughout all seven subunits (Table II and Fig. 1). Arthropod hemocyanins are clearly divided into three structural domains (9Linzen B. Soeter N.M. Riggs A.F. Schneider H.J. Schartau W. Moore M.D. Behrens P.Q. Nakashima H. Takagi T. Nemoto T.

In contrast, the central domain 2, which contains the copper-binding sites A and B, is strikingly conserved exhibiting 45% sequence identity.Table IIComparison of the E. californicum hemocyanin subunitsabcdefga0.74590.75400.69010.69270.58830.6500b53.4%0.51470.72270.75560.69860.6810c52.8%64.2%0.65950.73200.65300.6857d55.1%54.9%57.7%0.65630.51700.5598e55.5%54.0%55.3%57.9%0.50730.5393f59.6%55.7%57.4%63.9%64.0%0.4893g57.1%56.6%57.2%62.3%62.8%65.3%Pairwise sequence identities are below the diagonal, and the accepted amino acid changes per site according to Dayhoff's PAM 001 matrix are above the diagonal.

Open table in a new tab Pairwise sequence identities are below the diagonal, and the accepted amino acid changes per site according to Dayhoff's PAM 001 matrix are above the diagonal. Gaps were considered as missing data. Although hemocyanins are extracellular proteins, no signal peptides for transmembrane transport have been found in the subunit sequences. The available amino acid sequences from the N-terminal ends of the native polypeptides corroborate this result and show only the removal of the first (initiator) methionine (22Schartau W. Eyerle F. Reisinger P. Geisert H. Storz H. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1983; 364: 1383-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 23Schneider H.J. Drexel R. Feldmaier G. Linzen B.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the observation that in chelicerate hemocyanin is synthesized by free ribosomes and subsequently released by cell rupture (38Kempter B. Naturwissenschaften. 1983; 70: 255-256Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the proteins do not pass through the Golgi apparatus, and despite of the presence of several putative N-glycosylation sites (NX(T/S)) in the primary structure of all seven subunits, no carbohydrate moiety was detected in the native tarantula hemocyanin (1Markl J. Decker H. Adv. Comp. Environ. Physiol. 1992; 13: 325-376Crossref Google Scholar). The hemocyanin subunits of E. californicum display high sequence identity (between 52 and 60%) to hemocyanin subunit II of the horseshoe crab L. polyphemus(LpoHcII). The crystal structure of LpoHcII at 0.22 nm resolution had been elucidated by x-ray studies (14Hazes B. Magnus K.A. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Dauter Z. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 597-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thus, the likely three-dimensional structures of the tarantula hemocyanin subunits can be deduced by protein modeling using LpoHcII as a template (Fig. 2). The modeling process is straightforward. The models show only minor differences, all of which are located within the predicted loop regions. Root mean square values between 0.32 and 0.44 Å were calculated between the seven models. The positions of the amino acids conserved within all subunits were superimposed on the model of subunit a (Fig. 2). As expected, we found strong conservation within and around the copper-binding sites, most notably in the histidine-bearing α-helices 2.1 and 2.2 (CuA) and 2.5 and 2.6 (CuB). These structural similarities are the most likely explanation for the virtually identical oxygen binding properties of the different subunits (20Decker H. Markl J. Loewe R. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1505-1507PubMed Google Scholar, 21Markl J. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The cysteines forming the two disulfide-bridges present in LpoHcII, which stabilize domain 3 by connecting β-sheet 3K and α-helix 3.5, are also conserved in the E. californicum subunits. There is little conservation at the surface of the predicted subunit. This result is not unexpected, because specific subunit-subunit contact regions are required for the self-assembly process (19Markl J. Decker H. Stocker W. Savel A. Linzen B. Schutter W.G. van Bruggen E.F. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol Chem. 1981; 362: 185-188PubMed Google Scholar). Only 14 amino acids are conserved within all phenoloxidases, hemocyanins and hexamerins (Fig. 1). Because these proteins employ very different functions (11Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 42Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 43Burmester T. J. Biol.

Ed. 2000; 39: 1591-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), these residues are most likely maintained because of constrains that are imposed to the structure of the subunit. Indeed, we found among these invariant residues five prolines and two glycines that are involved in the formation of turn structures. Other turns, most notably adjacent to the central α-helices 2.1 and 2.6, are formed by conserved aspartate, threonine, and arginine residues. The central core with the copper-binding sites is stabilized by a salt bridge between Arg255 C-terminal to β-sheet 2C and an Asp259 adjacent to α-helix 2.6 (cf. Fig. 1). The models of the seven subunits were used to construct a tentative model of the native 24-mer E. californicum hemocyanin (Fig. 3). The subunits were arranged as deduced by electron microscopic images (7Decker H. Hartmann H. Sterner R. Schwarz E. Pilz I. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the positions of the subunits are displayed as deduced from immunoelectron microscopy (19Markl J. Decker H. Stocker W. Savel A. Linzen B. Schutter W.G. van Bruggen E.F. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol Chem. 1981; 362: 185-188PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the model displayed in Fig. 3 is indistinguishable from the electron microscopic pictures of the native hemocyanin molecules. The sequences of the seven subunits ofE. californicum hemocyanin were aligned with three additional known hemocyanin sequences of Chelicerata and with those of the Crustacea. Pairwise comparisons show that the hemocyanin subunits of the Chelicerata are less conserved (≤47.2% distance or 0.7540 corrected amino acid changes per site) than those of the Crustacea (≤42.9% or 0.6250 changes per site), which reflects the more ancient divergence of the chelicerate hemocyanins (see below). For phylogenetic inference, the available prophenoloxidase sequences of Crustacea and insects were included into the alignment. Prophenoloxidase-like proteins are the most likely ancestors of arthropod hemocyanins (11Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and thus the contemporary arthropod prophenoloxidase was considered as the outgroup. Phylogenetic trees were constructed assuming maximum parsimony or with the neighbor joining method. In all types of analysis, the hemocyanin subunits of the Chelicerata form a single, well supported clade that is strictly separated from that of the crustacean proteins (Fig. 4 A). This indicates that the subunits individually diversified in the subphyla after the Crustacea and Chelicerata diverged in the Cambrian or in an earlier period (45Conway-Morris S. Nature. 1993; 361: 219-225Crossref Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 46Valentine J.W. Jablonski D. Erwin D.E. Development. 1999; 126: 851-859PubMed Google Scholar). Within the clade of the chelicerate hemocyanins, the association between theE. californicum subunit b and c is strongly supported (100%). Moreover, the close relationship of these two subunits, as well as their early branching from the other chelicerate hemocyanins, is supported by comparative immunological studies (5Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar, 47Kempter B. Markl J. Brenowitz M. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Subunits b and c play an important role in the formation of the four-hexamer complex. They form a stable heterodimer under conditions when the hemocyanin complex is partially dissociated and contribute to inter-hexameric contact regions (37Markl J. Decker H. Linzen B. Schutter W.G. von Bruggen E.F. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1982; 363: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). From this it is likely that the ancestor of the tarantula hemocyanin and, therefore, the ancestral hemocyanin of the Arachnida stemline was a hexamer composed of a,b/c, d, e, f, and g-like subunits, with each subunit occupying a distinct position in the hemocyanin structure. The formation of the four-hexamer protein was then possible after gene duplication and emergence of distinct b and c type subunits. Although the bootstrap support is not very strong (40% to 60% in different analyses), both parsimony and neighbor joining analysis suggest that the branch leading to b and c diverged first; therefore, these proteins are basic to all other tarantula hemocyanin subunits and phylogenetically the closest to the phenoloxidase outgroup (Fig. 4 A). This is noteworthy because b andc are the only two tarantula hemocyanin subunits that exhibit a significant pseudophenoloxidase activity (42Decker H. Rimke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25889-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This phenomenon may be interpreted as a reminiscence of the origin of the hemocyanins from prophenoloxidases (11Burmester T. Scheller K. J. Mol. Evol. 1996; 42: 713-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). There is good statistical evidence (94% bootstrap support) for a close relationship of the tarantula subunit a with subunit II of the horseshoe crab L. polyphemus, and the orthology of these subunits is supported by immunological data (47Kempter B. Markl J. Brenowitz M. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These studies also suggested common epitopes in the e and g subunits on the one hand and in d and f on the other hand (5Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar, 28Lamy J. Lamy J. Weill J. Markl J. Schneider H.J. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, this conclusion could not be confirmed by the sequence data. Although there is moderate support for a common clade of subunits d, e, f, and g(68%), the resolution of the relationships among these and the other chelicerate subunits is very poor, indicating a lack of phylogenetic signal, which may be interpreted as the result of a rapid diversification from a single primordial chelicerate hemocyanin. Phylogenetic analysis using a DNA alignment of the hemocyanin coding sequences did not perform better but showed essentially the same topology of the tree (not shown). Limulus subunit II and tarantula subunita are orthologous proteins that most likely diverged at the time of speciation of the Merestomata and Arachnida. These taxa split between 420 and 480 MYA (33Dunlop, J. A., and Selden, P. A. (1997) Arthropod Relationships (Fortey, R. A., and Thomas, R. H., eds) pp. 221–236, Systematic Association Special Volume Series 55, Chapman and Hall, London.Google Scholar). Under the assumption of an approximate divergence time of about 450 MYA, a mean amino acid substitution rate of 6.4 ± 0.4 × 10−10/site/year was inferred from the distance data set. Then the earliest time of divergence of the chelicerate hemocyanin subunits (i.e. b/c versus others) was estimated to have occurred about 555 ± 37 MYA (Fig. 4 B), probably in the stemline of the Chelicerata. Immunological data suggest that the inter-hexameric contact subunits b and c split within the Arachnida but before the Araneae and the Scorpiones diverged (47Kempter B. Markl J. Brenowitz M. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in the Silurian period (33Dunlop, J. A., and Selden, P. A. (1997) Arthropod Relationships (Fortey, R. A., and Thomas, R. H., eds) pp. 221–236, Systematic Association Special Volume Series 55, Chapman and Hall, London.Google Scholar). We calculate the time of theb-c split about 412 ± 27 MYA. This date is consistent with the available fossil record of chelicerate evolution (33Dunlop, J. A., and Selden, P. A. (1997) Arthropod Relationships (Fortey, R. A., and Thomas, R. H., eds) pp. 221–236, Systematic Association Special Volume Series 55, Chapman and Hall, London.Google Scholar) and indicates that the chelicerate hemocyanin evolved in an at least approximate clock-like manner. The other E. californicum subunit types diversified between about 474 ± 45 MYA. Thus, the mutations that differentiate the subunit types hemocyanin occurred more than 400 MYA, but apparently no distinct subunit emerged in the tarantula stemline after this date. A 24-mer built by seven different subunits appears to be the original quaternary structure of the Arachnida hemocyanins, and other subunit compositions of hemocyanins in several non-orthognathan taxa of the Arachnida should be interpreted as secondary rearrangements (5Markl J. Biol. Bull. (Woods Hole). 1986; 171: 90-115Crossref Google Scholar). In summary, E. californicum hemocyanin is a true molecular fossil with a subunit organization that has been conserved for approximately half a billion years. However, the oxygen binding properties of the different subunits have remained constant (20Decker H. Markl J. Loewe R. Linzen B. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1979; 360: 1505-1507PubMed Google Scholar, 21Markl J. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), reflected by the conservation of the copper-binding sites. Nevertheless, the ancient differentiation suggests particular roles for each of the subunits within the native multi-hexameric hemocyanin, either related to the cooperative function or to the structure of this protein (6Markl J.

Here we investigate the complex eye of scallops. Electron microscopic inspection revealed that the anterior, single layered corneal epithelium overlying the cellular lens contains a regular array of microvilli that we propose might contribute to its optical properties. The sole crystallin of the scallop eye lens was found to be homologous to Ω-crystallin, a minor crystallin in cephalopods related to aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) class 1/2. Scallop Ω-crystallin (officially designated ALDH1A9) is 55–56% identical to its cephalopod homologues, while it is 67 and 64% identical to human ALDH 2 and 1, respectively, and 61% identical to retinaldehyde dehydrogenase/η-crystallin of elephant shrews. Like other enzyme-crystallins, scallop Ω-crystallin appears to be present in low amounts in non-ocular tissues. Within the scallop eye, immunofluorescence tests indicated that Ω-crystallin expression is confined to the lens and cornea. Although it has conserved the critical residues required for activity in other ALDHs and appears by homology modeling to have a structure very similar to human ALDH2, scallop Ω-crystallin was enzymatically inactive with diverse substrates and did not bind NAD or NADP. In contrast to mammalian ALDH1 and -2 and other cephalopod Ω-crystallins, which are tetrameric proteins, scallop Ω-crystallin is a dimeric protein.

Despite their specialized task for vision, the crystallins are a surprisingly diverse group of multifunctional proteins (1Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Annu. Rev.

The taxon-specific crystallins are related or identical to metabolic enzymes. Both the ubiquitous and taxon-specific crystallins are present at lower concentrations outside of the lens, where they have non-refractive roles. In many cases, the non-refractive functions of the lens crystallins protect against physiological stress. The most striking example of this is αB-crystallin, which is a small heat shock protein (10Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar, 11Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyuama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The abundant αA- and αB-crystallins not only influence the optical properties of the vertebrate lens but also act as molecular chaperones to protect against protein aggregation during aging (15Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10449-10453Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar). We have called this dual use of a single protein, gene sharing (7Piatigorsky J. Wistow G. Cell. 1989; 57: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 16Piatigorsky J. O'Brien W.E. Norman B.L. Kalumuck K. Wistow G.J. Borras T. Nickerson J.M. Wawrousek E.F. Proc. Natl.

The evolutionary strategy of gene sharing and the use of enzyme-crystallins extend to invertebrate lenses (17Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 449-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The first described example of an invertebrate enzyme-crystallin is the glutathioneS-transferase-related S-crystallins of cephalopods (17Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 449-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 18Wistow G. Piatigorsky J. Science. 1987; 236: 1554-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 19Tomarev S.I.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8604-8612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)1 is the only known taxon-specific crystallin that occurs in both vertebrates and invertebrates (17Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 449-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Ω-Crystallin is an aldehyde dehydrogenase-derived crystallin in the ocular lens of cephalopods (squid and octopus). In general, it is a minor crystallin of these invertebrate lenses, but is more prevalent in octopus than squid (21Zinovieva R.D. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11449-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The same protein, however, is the sole crystallin in the transparent lens of the light organ of the squid, Euprymna scolopes, where it is called L-crystallin (22Montgomery M.K. McFall-Ngai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20999-21003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ω/L-crystallin is equally related to cytoplasmic ALDH1 and mitochondrial ALDH2 of mammals as judged by amino acid sequence. Tests for enzyme activity using the most common substrates for the mammalian proteins have proved negative (21Zinovieva R.D. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11449-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Montgomery M.K. McFall-Ngai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20999-21003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vertebrates, an ALDH1 orthologue with retinaldehyde dehydrogenase activity has been recruited as a lens crystallin in elephant shrews, where it is called η-crystallin (23Wistow G. Kim H. J. Mol. Evol. 1991; 32: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Graham C. Hodin J. Wistow G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15623-15628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Elephant shrews have another ALDH1 gene called ALDH1-nl (for non-lens), which is expressed in the liver (24Graham C. Hodin J. Wistow G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15623-15628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although ALDH is not especially abundant in other vertebrate lenses, there are unexpectedly high levels of ALDH3 in the transparent corneal epithelial cells of mammals (25Evces S. Lindahl R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 518-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Abedinia M. Pain T. Algar E.M. Holmes R.S. Exp.

This abundant corneal protein was originally called BCP 54 (for bovine corneal protein with a molecular mass of 54 kDa) (30Silverman B. Alexander R.J. Henley W.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 33: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 31Alexander R.J. Silverman B. Henley W.L. Exp. Eye Res. 1981; 32: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ALDH1 is also found at high concentrations in the transparent stromal keratocytes of the rabbit cornea (32Jester J.V. Moller-Pedersen T. Huang J. Sax C.M. Kays Wm T. Cavangh H.D. Petroll W.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 613-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The surprisingly high levels of ALDH, as well as of several other enzymes, has suggested the possibility that these proteins play a structural role in cornea as do the enzyme-crystallins in the lens (33Piatigorsky J. Progr. Retinal Eye Res. 1998; 17: 145-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In the present investigation we have examined the protein composition of the ocular lens of the scallop. Scallops have numerous complex eyes protruding from the mantle lining the outer edge of each shell. The highly developed scallop eyes have a single-layered corneal epithelium covering the cellular lens (34Land M.F. J. Physiol. 1965; 179: 138-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Barber V.C. Evans E.M. Land M.F. Z. Zellforsch. 1967; 76: 295-312Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 36Land M.F. Contemp. Phys. 1988; 29: 435-455Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These eyes have a double retina, and an argenteum, which reflects focussed images on the distal photoreceptor cells. The distal retina reacts to negative light stimuli generated by the images, while the proximal retina reacts to positive light stimuli (37Gorman A.L.F. McReynolds J.S. Science. 1969; 165: 309-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We show here by cDNA cloning that the predominant water-soluble protein of the cellular lens of the scallop belongs to the ALDH1/2 family, as does Ω-crystallin of cephalopods. Our immunofluorescence data also suggest that Ω-crystallin is present in the scallop cornea. The adult sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) and bay scallops (Argopecten irradians) were obtained from the Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, MA. Juvenile bay scallops were obtained from Mook Sea Farms, Inc., Walpole, ME. Cutting the adductor muscle with scissors separated the two shells of fresh scallops. The eyes were removed from the mantle along the edges of the separated shells with surgical scissors, and the lenses were dissected from the eyes under the microscope. Homogenates were made in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 0.1 m NaCl, and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant fractions were taken as the water-soluble protein. These were subjected to electrophoresis in an SDS-12.5% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. The tryptic peptides derived from the major band of protein were microsequenced (Harvard Microchemical Facility, Cambridge, MA). Native lens proteins were examined by Superose HR-12 and HR-6 column chromatography in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Amino acid sequences were analyzed and the evolutionary tree was made by using the Phylip program (38Felsentein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package) Version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar) by means of the values calculated by the Clustral W program (39Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55766) Google Scholar). The SegMod algorithm (40Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 507-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) implemented in the program GeneMine was used to build a homology model of scallop ALDH, based on the crystal structure of human mitochondrial ALDH2 (41Steinmetz C.G. Xie P. Weiner H. Hurley T.D. Structure. 1997; 5: 701-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) and the considerable sequence homology of the two proteins. The program CHARMM (42Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminatihan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13967) Google Scholar) was used to compare the model and template structures and to calculate the fractional accessible surface area (fASA) of all residues in the model. The fASA for each residue was obtained as the ratio of its accessible surface area (43Lee B. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 379-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar) in the modeled protein structure to that in an extended Gly-X-Gly tripeptide. A probe radius of 1.4 Å was used. The ALDH2 antibody was a generous gift of Dr. Henry Weiner (Biochemistry Department, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN). It was a polyclonal antibody, prepared in rabbits against Escherichia coli recombinantly expressed human liver ALDH2. The anti-Ω/L-crystallin polyclonal antibody was a gift of Dr. Margaret J. McFall-Ngai (Pacific Biomedical Research Center, Kewalo Marine Laboratory, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI). It was made in rabbits against purified L-crystallin from the lens of the light organ of the squid, E. scolopes. For Western immunoblots, the proteins were transferred from the gel onto filters; the latter were developed using Pierce immunopure ABC staining kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Alternatively, Western blotting was performed by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL RPN 2106 Kit. For immunofluorescence, segments of the mantle containing 3–5 eyes were cut free from freshly opened scallops. The tissue samples were immersed for 6 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and washed for 24 h in PBS. The eyes were subsequently removed from the mantle, embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. compound (Miles Laboratories, Inc., Elkhart, IN) and 15–20-μm sections were cut on a cryostat. The sections were preincubated with SuperBlock (Pierce) for 30 min and incubated overnight at room temperature with anti-Ω/L-crystallin at a dilution of 1:200 for bay scallop eyes and 1:500 for sea scallop eyes. After 3 washes in PBS, biotinylated secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) were added for 1 h. The slides were washed again, covered with streptavidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h, mounted in Dako fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Carpinteria, CA), and viewed with a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) microscope. Control experiments were performed using either PBS or preimmune serum instead of the primary antibody. Total RNA from adult scallop tissues was extracted with NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The RNA species were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose, 3% formaldehyde gel and were blotted onto nylon filters (Hybond-N). The blot was hybridized with a 677-bp probe that contains a region of cDNA from nucleotides 51 to 728l. This was obtained by digesting pGEM-T-ALD5′ plasmid with ApaI andPstI. The hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 1 h in QuikHyb solution (Stratagene, Jolla, CA). The blot was washed once with 2 × SSC + 1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, once with 1 × SSC + 1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min, and twice with 0.5 × SSC + 1% SDS at 65 °C for 15 min. The hybridized blot was exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) at −80 °C with two intensifying screens overnight for Ω-crystallin and for 6 h for actin. After the removal of the first probe, the filter was hybridized under the same conditions with a probe against P. magellanicus actin (GenBank accession number U55046). The actin probe was obtained by RT-PCR and contained the region from nucleotide 305 to 624. RNA was isolated from adult scallop eyes and from juvenile animals using the guanidinium isothiocyanate method with an RNA isolation kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In order to reduce a brown contaminating pigment that inhibited the reverse transcriptase reaction, the following modification was necessary. After ethanol precipitation, the RNA pellet was resuspended in proteinase K digestion buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 2 mg/ml proteinase K), incubated for 1 h at 42 °C and re-extracted with phenol/chloroform. For RT-PCR analysis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using random oligodeoxynucleotide hexamers as primers and Superscript II (Life Technologies), followed by PCR using degenerate primers encoding conserved regions of ALDH proteins: forward primer AA(AG)CCNGCNGA(AG)CA(AG)ACNCC (corresponding to amino acids KPAEQTP) and reverse primer GGNCC(AG)AA(TGA)AT(CT)TC(CT)TC(TC)TT (corresponding to amino acids KEEIFGP). PCR products were cloned into the T-vector and sequenced. The three scallop ALDH cDNA sequences were identified among the PCR products and the corresponding clones designated pALD-eye (for ALDH-crystallin), pALD1, and pALD3. The scallop eye-specific cDNA library in the λ phage vector was constructed using the SMART technology, which favors the production of full-length clones, essentially as recommended by the manufacturer (CLONTECH, Palo, CA). Briefly, 2 μg of the total eye RNA were used for the reverse transcription using Superscript II enzyme and primer ATTCTAGAGGCCGAGGCGGCCGACATG(T)30(AGC)N. The reverse transcription was carried out in the presence of the SMART oligonucleotide AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTATGGCCGGG. Double stranded cDNA was cut with SfiI and cloned into SfilI cut λ TriplEx2 vector. Approximately 1.5 × 107 primary phage clones were obtained. The library was amplified by plating the primary library on 15, 20 × 20-cm LB agar plates; the phage were harvested by washing with 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 35 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.01% gelatin. Full-length ALDH-crystallin cDNA was obtained by screening approximately 5 × 106 phage clones of the amplified eye library with the 650-bp insert from pALD-eye. Three of the positive phage cDNA inserts were subcloned into the plasmid vector and sequenced on both strands using an automated DNA sequencer ALF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and primer walking strategy. The resulting DNA sequence has been deposited into the GenBank (accession number AF148508). The deduced amino acid sequence was compared with those contained in the GenBank data base by using the TFASTA program from the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) package (44Hickson R.E. Simon C. Perrey S.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 530-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The alignment of the sequences was performed with the Pileup Program of GCG (45Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9381) Google Scholar). The restriction sitesBclI and EcoRI were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of ALDH coding sequence, respectively, using primers GCAGTTGATCACATATGAGTACGCCTATCAAAAAC (5′ BclI) and GGAATTCGTTATGTTTGGTAAGGCACTTGCG (3′ EcoRI). The modified ALDH cDNA was then introduced into E. coli expression vector pETH2α carrying the N-terminal 6 × histidine tag. The restriction sites NdeI and EcoRI were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of ALDH coding sequence, respectively, using primers GCAGTTGATCACATATGAGTACGCCTATCAAAAAC (5′ NdeI) and GGAATTCGACTTTGGTTGGAGTTTTGAT (3′ EcoRI) in order to introduce the cDNA into the E. coli expression vector pETH2αHIS carrying the C-terminal 6 × histidine tag. The recombinant proteins were expressed in the E. coli strain BL21(DE3, pLysS) (46Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) and purified on Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) under denaturation conditions in the presence of 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol. The proteins were renatured by dialysis against a stepwise urea gradient to lower the chance of irreversible precipitation of the recombinant proteins. Final dialysis buffer was either 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, or 50 mm phosphate (pH 8.0), and 100 mm NaCl containing 0.1% Triton X-100 or 0.1% Tween 20. All dialysis buffers contained 1 mm dithiothreitol. Light and electron microscopy were performed on eyes that were removed and fixed by immersion at room temperature for at least 24 h. For light microscopy, the eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 50 mm Na-potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) with 8% sucrose, embedded in glycol methacrylate, sectioned longitudinally along the central axis at a thickness of 1 to 2 μm, and stained with toluidine blue, hematoxylin, and eosin, or by the periodic-acid Schiff reaction. For electron microscopy the eyes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm Na-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) with 6% sucrose and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, micrographs were taken with a JEM-100CX electron microscope (JEOL USA Inc., Peabody, MA) and several low magnification montages were prepared to preserve orientation and compare with micrographs taken by light microscopy while obtaining higher resolution. ALDH activity was assayed by the increase in the absorbance at 340 nm caused by the reduction of NAD+ to NADH, according to the procedure of Bostian and Betts (47Bostian K.A. Betts G.F. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 787-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Baker yeast ALDH was obtained commercially (Sigma). The cornea, comprising a single layer of epithelial cells, cellular lens, and double-layered retina can be seen in the micrographs of transected eyes of juvenile bay (Fig. 1, A and B) and adult sea (Fig. 1 C) scallops. The cornea is contiguous with the pigmented epithelial cells extending along both sides of the eye. The electron micrograph in Fig. 1 B shows lens, corneal, and pigmented cells of the juvenile bay scallop eye from the region demarcated by the bracket in Fig. 1 A. The lens cells of the juvenile eye are nucleated. In contrast to the organelle-rich cytoplasm of the corneal cells, the cytoplasm of the lens cells lacks organelles and appears homogeneous, as is typical of lens cells of other species, from jellyfish (48Piatigorsky J. Horwitz J. Kuwabara T. Cutress C.E. J. Comp. Physiol. A. 1989; 164: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) to humans (49Kuzak J.R. Brown H.G. Albert D.M. Jakobiec F.A. Principles and Practice of Ophthalmology. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1994: 82-96Google Scholar). Regularly arranged microvilli are present along the anterior surface of the corneal epithelial cells (Fig. 1 B). The soluble proteins of the whole eye, excised lens, and other scallop tissues were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2). The Coomassie Blue-stainedleft-hand panel of Fig. 2 shows that there were relatively few water-soluble proteins in the whole eye extracts derived from the bay (lane 3) and sea (lane 4) scallop. Of special interest, only the 50-kDa band was visible in the extract of the excised sea scallop lens (lane 2). A similar result was obtained when 20 times as much water-soluble protein of the excised bay scallop lens was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). By contrast, the water-soluble proteins of the sea scallop gills (lane 5), digestive gland (lane 6), stomach (lane 7), mantle (lane 8) and adductor muscle (data not shown) were very heterogeneous in size. There was relatively little staining at the region in the gel corresponding to a molecular mass of 50 kDa in the lanes used for these non-ocular tissues. Since only the 50-kDa protein was detectable in the isolated lens, we performed Western blots to test whether it was related to the similar sized ALDH/Ω-crystallin of cephalopod (squid and octopus) lenses, inasmuch as both scallops and cephalopods are molluscs. Cephalopod Ω-crystallin is closely related to mammalian ALDH1 and -2 (17Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 449-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21Zinovieva R.D. Tomarev S.I. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11449-11455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The right-hand panel of Fig. 2 shows that the 50-kDa protein of the eyes (lanes 3 and 4) and excised lens (lane 2) reacted strongly by Western immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-ALDH2 antibody made against recombinant human ALDH2 (generously provided by Dr. Henry Weiner, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN). Note that the intensity of the band obtained in the Western blot using only 0.05 μg of protein from the isolated lens (lane 2) was similar to that obtained with 5 μg of the total eye proteins (lanes 3 and 4). Commercially obtained Baker yeast ALDH reacted with this antibody as well (lane 1). The 50-kDa eye protein of the bay scallop also reacted with a polyclonal antibody made against purified Ω/L-crystallin of the octopus (E. scolopes) light organ lens (22Montgomery M.K. McFall-Ngai M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20999-21003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (generously provided by Dr. Margaret McFall Ngai, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI) (data not shown). The Western blots in the right-hand panel of Fig. 2 showed that a 50-kDa protein, as well as varying amounts of more rapidly migrating polypeptides, from the digestive gland (lane 6), stomach (lane 7), and mantle (lane 8) also reacted with the anti-ALDH2 antibody. Although immunoreactive 50-kDa proteins were present in these non-ocular tissues, it should be noted that there was 100–200 times more protein analyzed from the non-ocular tissues than from the eye. In contrast to the other tissues, the gill (lane 5) had neither a 50-kDa polypeptide nor smaller polypeptides that reacted with the human anti-ALDH2 antibody. Without additional data it is uncertain whether the larger reactive proteins in the non-ocular extracts were cross-reacting proteins or ALDH-related proteins that were modified or were not reduced into subunits under the present conditions. We next investigated the native size of the major water-soluble protein of the isolated bay scallop lens by Superose HR-12 column chromatography (Fig. 3). The results gave a single peak of protein with a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the 100-kDa protein after reduction with dithiothreitol gave a single band of protein with a molecular mass of approximately 50-kDa protein as expected (data not shown). The isolated 100-kDa protein re-chromatographed on a Superose HR-6 column as a 100-kDa protein (data not shown). No magnesium was present in the elution buffer since this ion is known to reduce tetrameric horse liver ALDH to dimers (50Takahashi K. Weiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8206-8209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar result was obtained with the sea scallop eye proteins (data not shown). Finally, commercially obtained yeast ALDH and recombinant human ALDH2 (generously provided by Dr. Henry Weiner, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN)) chromatographed as a 200-kDa protein on the Superose HR-6 and HR-12 columns (data not shown). The 50-kDa protein band of the sea scallop eye was isolated from the SDS-polya"
https://openalex.org/W2139169485,"The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) is a chemotactic G protein-coupled receptor found on the surface of phagocytes. We have previously shown that the formyl peptide binding site maps to the membrane-spanning region (Miettinen, H. M., Mills, J. S., Gripentrog, J. M., Dratz, E. A., Granger, B. L., and Jesaitis, A. J. (1997) <i>J. Immunol.</i> 159, 4045–4054). Recent reports have indicated that non-formylated peptides, such as MMWLL can also activate this receptor (Chen, J., Bernstein, H. S., Chen, M., Wang, L., Ishi, M., Turck, C. W., and Coughlin, S. R. (1995) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 270, 23398–23401.) Here we show that the selectivity for the binding of different NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal analogs of MMWLL or MLF can be markedly altered by mutating Asp-106 to asparagine or Arg-201 to alanine. Both D106N and R201A produced a similar change in ligand specificity, including an enhanced ability to bind the HIV-1 peptide DP178. In contrast, the mutation R205A exhibited altered specificity at the COOH terminus of <i>f</i>MLF, with R205A binding <i>f</i>MLF-<i>O</i>-butyl ><i>f</i>MLF-<i>O</i>-methyl > <i>f</i>MLF, whereas wt FPR bound <i>f</i>MLF ><i>f</i>MLF-<i>O</i>-methyl ∼<i>f</i>MLF-<i>O</i>-butyl.

BRCA2 has been found to be overexpressed in many breast tumors, suggesting that altered expression of the BRCA2 gene may contribute to breast tumorigenesis. To determine how BRCA2 is overexpressed in tumors, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the BRCA2 promoter. Deletion mapping of the BRCA2 promoter identified three regions associated with 3-fold activation or repression and one upstream stimulatory factor binding site associated with 20-fold activation. Gel shift and cotransfection studies verified the role of USF in regulation of BRCA2 transcription. Analysis of the −144 to −59 region associated with 3-fold activation identified a putative NFκB binding site. Cotransfection of the p65 and p50 subunits of NFκB up-regulated the BRCA2 promoter 16-fold in a luciferase reporter assay, whereas mutations in the binding site ablated the effect. Gel shift and supershift assays with anti-p65 and -p50 antibodies demonstrated that NFκB binds specifically to the NFκB site. In addition, ectopic expression of NFκB resulted in increased levels of endogeneous BRCA2 expression. Thus, NFκB and USF regulate BRCA2 expression through the BRCA2 promoter.

Moreover, cells expressing mutant BRCA2 are more sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate-induced DNA damage than cells expressing wild type BRCA2 (12Chen P.L. Chen C.F. Chen Y. Xiao J. Sharp Z.D.

BRCA2 is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner with peak expression in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Low levels of expression are detected in G0, G1, and M phase (14Vaughn J.P.

Cell cycle-dependent expression has recently been associated with binding of the upstream stimulatory factor (USF)1protein and Elf-1 transcription factor to the BRCA2 promoter (15Davis P.L. Miron A. Andersen L.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6000-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, BRCA2 expression is elevated indirectly in response to the mitogenic activity of estrogen, which has been associated with progression of the cell cycle (16Spillman M.A. Bowcock A.M.

Furthermore, recent studies of BRCA2−/− mouse embryo fibroblasts identified extensive chromosomal rearrangement, centrosome amplification, and aneuploidy, consistent with abrogation of a mitotic checkpoint (18Lee H.

Also, the BRCA2 promoter is not inactivated by methylation in breast tumors (25Collins N. Wooster R. Stratton M.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1997; 76: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although no sequence alterations have been found in the BRCA2 gene in sporadic tumors, it remains possible that BRCA2 does contribute to sporadic breast cancer development, albeit not by inactivation of the BRCA2 protein through mutagenesis and methylation. One possible mechanism of BRCA2 involvement is through deregulated expression of the BRCA2 gene. Recently, it has been shown that BRCA2 is significantly overexpressed in many sporadic breast cancers (26Bieche I. Nogues C. Lidereau R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5232-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is not known whether this overexpression of BRCA2 is due to induction of the BRCA2 promoter or is a result of an increased number of cells in S phase of the cell cycle. However, when combining this observation with the known relevance of BRCA2 function to regulation of cell proliferation, it seems likely that expression of the BRCA2 gene is tightly regulated and that altered expression of BRCA2 may contribute to breast cancer development.To begin to assess the contribution of altered expression of BRCA2 to breast tumorigenesis, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the BRCA2 promoter. Here we provide evidence for direct induction of the BRCA2 promoter through binding of the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) transcription factor, and we verify the role of USF in regulation of basal activity of the promoter.DISCUSSIONEvidence for involvement of BRCA2 in regulation of cellular response to DNA damage (9Sharan S.K.

A. 1998; 95: 13869-13874Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) has been accumulating. The variety of functions of BRCA2 suggests that regulation of expression levels of this gene may play an important role in regulation of a number of important cellular processes and that alterations in BRCA2 expression may contribute to tumorigenesis. Interestingly, although no somatic mutations have been identified in BRCA2, apparent overexpression of BRCA2 has been detected in a significant proportion of sporadic breast cancers.In this study, we have shown that the NFκB transcription factor binds to the BRCA2 promoter and induces expression of the BRCA2 gene. Deletion mapping of the promoter determined that the −144 and −59 region, which contains an NFκB binding site (GGAATTTCCT), is associated with 3-fold activation of the promoter. A combination of gel shift and supershift assays confirmed that NFκB binds to the NFκBcis-element. In addition, ectopic expression of NFκB subunits p65 or p65 plus p50 resulted in induction of the BRCA2 promoter and increased levels of BRCA2 mRNA and protein within MCF-7 cells, whereas substitution mutations in the NFκB binding site ablated these effects. These data strongly suggest that NFκB can activate the BRCA2 promoter and induce increased expression of the BRCA2 gene.The NFκB transcription factor consists mostly of p50/p65 heterodimers, which are complexed to IκBα in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Upon activation of the NFκB signaling pathway, degradation of IκBα exposes nuclear localization signals on the p50/p65 heterodimer leading to nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation of a number of promoters. In this study, we have shown that overexpression of the p50 DNA-binding domain of NFκB does not result in up-regulation of the BRCA2 promoter. Ectopically expressed p50 most likely forms a heterodimer with endogeneous p65, but because p65 levels are low and the NFκB nuclear localization signals are present in p65, relatively little heterodimer translocates to the nucleus and binds to the BRCA2 promoter. Conversely, expression of the p65 subunit with or without ectopic p50 significantly induced luciferase activity, suggesting that the transactivating p65 subunit is necessary for induction of the BRCA2 promoter. Overexpressed p65 most likely binds to endogeneous p50, saturates IκB, and translocates to the nucleus resulting in up-regulation of the BRCA2 promoter. In this case, endogeneous levels of p50 appear to be sufficient to facilitate increased binding of the p50/p65 heterodimer to the promoter. Although only the p50 and p65 NFκB subunits were analyzed in this study, it is likely that the other subunits such as c-Rel, p52, and RelB are also capable of contributing to induction of the BRCA2 promoter.To verify the role of NFκB in BRCA2 transcriptional regulation we also evaluated the effect of the NFκB signaling pathway on BRCA2 expression. IκB is a component of the NFκB signaling pathway that binds to NFκB and prevents nuclear translocation of NFκB. Thus, overexpression of IκBα or a dominant negative form of IκBα that is resistant to IKK dependent degradation is expected to inhibit NFκB nuclear translocation and NFκB dependent promoter induction. In this study, ectopic expression of both dn-IκBα and IκBα abrogated NFκB-dependent BRCA2 promoter induction and down-regulated BRCA2 mRNA levels, suggesting that expression of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor can be regulated by modulation of the NFκB signaling pathway.NFκB is known to regulate expression of a large number of genes that play critical roles in regulation of apoptosis, tumorigenesis, and inflammation. In breast cancers, alterations in DNA binding activity, gene expression, and/or nuclear translocation of NFκB proteins have been observed. More specifically, increased NFκB DNA binding activity has been correlated with expression of the c-erbB-2 gene (34Raziuddin A. Court D. Sarkar F.H. Liu Y.L. Kung H. Raziuddin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15715-15720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and high levels of NFκB/Rel binding have been observed in carcinogen-induced primary rat mammary tumors (35Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Because NFκB appears to regulate BRCA2 expression, it seems likely that alterations in NFκB expression and DNA binding (34Raziuddin A. Court D. Sarkar F.H. Liu Y.L. Kung H. Raziuddin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15715-15720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 35Sovak M.A. Bellas R.E. Kim D.W. Zanieski G.J. Rogers A.E. Traish A.M. Sonenshein G.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2952-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) contribute to the observed overexpression of BRCA2 in breast tumors (26Bieche I. Nogues C. Lidereau R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5232-5238Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Thus, alteration of expression of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene may be one mechanism by which aberrantly regulated NFκB contributes to tumorigenesis.Interestingly, a 3-fold difference in luciferase activity between the pGL3Prom construct and the Del-14 construct was detected in the presence of ectopically expressed p65. This result suggests that other elements within the BRCA2 promoter are directly or indirectly responsive to NFκB. One other NFκB consensus binding site (GAGAAACCCC) was identified in the promoter at positions −808 to −799. However, using deletion constructs and by overexpressing p65, we have shown that this NFκB site does not play a role in regulation of the BRCA2 promoter (data not shown). Thus, othercis-elements that are indirectly affected by NFκB may contribute to regulation of the BRCA2 promoter.In addition to NFκB responsive elements, we have also identified another activation domain that results in 3-fold reduction in activity when removed and a single repression domain that results in 2.5-fold activation when removed (Fig. 1 B). The transcription factor binding sites from these regions and the associated transcription factors that contribute to regulation of the BRCA2 promoter are not yet known. Recently a repression domain associated with 10-fold down-regulation of the BRCA2 promoter was reported (36Sharan C. Hamilton N.M. Parl A.K. Singh P.K. Chaudhuri G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 265: 285-290Google Scholar). This domain is associated with two Alu repeats and is located in the Del-7 and Del-8 clones and is deleted from the Del-9 clone shown in Fig. 1. However, in the current study the repression domain in the BRCA2 promoter maps to a different location (Del-9; Fig.1). Further studies are needed to explain the differing results from the two studies.The role of the USF transcription factor in regulation of basal transcription from the BRCA2 promoter was also verified in the course of this study. A critical 20-bp regulatory sequence (−34 to −15), which is predominantly controlled by binding of USF and is responsible for the majority of BRCA2 transcription, was identified. The critical 20-bp region contains a tandem repeat sequence (GCGTCACG) (Fig.2 A) and consensus DNA-binding motifs for transcription factors such as c-Myc, ATF, and USF. Gel shift, supershift, and cotransfection studies demonstrated that only USF binds to the second repeat and regulates the BRCA2 promoter. Recently, Davis and colleagues (15Davis P.L. Miron A. Andersen L.M. Iglehart J.D. Marks J.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6000-6012Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported that USF binds to the BRCA2 promoter as a heterodimeric complex of USF-1 and USF-2 and regulates basal transcription in a cell cycle-dependent manner. In this earlier study, overexpression of USF in MCF-7 cells induced only a 2.5-fold increase in promoter activity. However, the addition of IE62, a varicella zoster viral protein that binds to USF proteins (37Meier J.L. Luo X. Sawadogo M. Straus S.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6896-6906Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), resulted in 12-fold induction of promoter activity. Similarly, we have demonstrated that expression of a USF-VP16 fusion protein enhanced induction of the promoter. These results suggest that a co-activating factor is needed for USF activation of the BRCA2 promoter.The USF family of basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper transcription factors were originally named MLTF because of their involvement in transcription from the adenovirus major later promoter (38Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1985; 43: 165-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that many USF target genes such as p53 (39Reisman D. Rotter V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor β2 (40Scholtz B. Kingsley-Kallesen M. Rizzino A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32375-32380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and cyclin B1 (41Cogswell J.P. Godlevski M.M. Bonham M. Bisi J. Babiss L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2782-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) are involved in regulation of proliferation and the cell cycle. Moreover, USF overexpression significantly inhibits c-Myc-dependent cell transformation (42Luo X. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and proliferation of certain transformed cells (29Qyang Y. Luo X. Lu T. Ismail P.M. Krylov D. Vinson C. Sawadogo M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1508-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene promoter by USF is consistent with the anti-proliferative effect of this transcription factor. The observation that USF transcriptional activity is lost in breast cancer cell lines but not in normal breast epithelial cells (28Ismail P.M. Lu T. Sawadogo M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5582-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) further supports a role for USF as a key regulator of breast cancer development. The combination of these studies and our data suggests that regulation of BRCA2 promoter activity by USF may serve an essential role in the prevention of breast cancer development. BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor gene associated with familial predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer (1Wooster R. Bignell G. Lancaster J. Swift S. Seal S. Mangion J. Collins N. Gregory S. Gumbs C.

Mutations in BRCA2 are thought to account for 20–35% of all inherited breast cancers and are associated with a 37–85% lifetime risk of developing cancer (3Thorlacius S. Struewing J.P. Hartge P.

The great majority of disease-associated mutations in BRCA2 result in truncation of the BRCA2 protein, suggesting that loss of function of BRCA2 results in tumor susceptibility. However, the mechanisms by which the BRCA2 protein suppresses tumor cell growth are largely unknown. The BRCA2 gene encodes a 3418-amino acid nuclear protein (2Tavtigian S.V. Simard J. Rommens J.

The identity of the reaction product was confirmed by thin layer chromatography, fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy, chemical analysis, and by UV spectroscopy. One mole of the product was formed from approximately 1 mol of each of the reactants. The enzyme showed maximal activity at pH 8.5 and 55 °C in the presence of Mg2+ and K+ ions. By in vivo pulse labeling of phospholipids with32Pi, CDP-archaeol was found to be an intracellular intermediate. A cell-free homogenate of M. thermoautotrophicus, when incubated with l-serine, converted the product of CDP-archaeol synthase reaction to a product with the same chromatographic mobility as archaetidylserine. It was concluded from these results that both CDP-archaeol and CDP-archaeol synthase were involved in cellular phospholipid biosynthesis. Among various synthetic substrate analogs, both enantiomers of unsaturated archaetidic acid possessing geranylgeranyl chains showed similar levels of activity, while archaetidic acid with saturated or monounsaturated isoprenoid or straight chains was a poor substrate, despite having the same stereostructure as the fully active substrate.

Because all the archaeal phospholipids consist of ether linkages between glycerophosphate (GP)1 and isoprenoid alcohols, they are usually referred to as “ether lipids.” Another remarkable feature of archaeal phospholipids is the stereoconfiguration of the GP backbone. The GP backbone of phospholipid in Archaea issn-glycero-1-phosphate (G-1-P), which is the enantiomer of its bacterial and eucaryal counterparts (1Kates M. Prog. Chem. Fats Other Lipids. 1978; 15: 301-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). So far, no exception to this arrangement in the stereostructure of GP has been found, and remains the most fundamental distinguishing characteristic of the organisms in each of these domains (2Koga Y. Kyuragi T. Nishihara M. Sone N. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In vitro studies of polar lipid biosynthesis in Archaea have been carried out since 1990, and the enzymes catalyzing the first three steps have been identified (Refs. 3Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 117: 933-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Zhang D.-L. Daniels L. Poulter C.D. J. Am. Chem.

The last intermediate (2,3-di-O-geranylgeranyl-G-1-P = 2,3-GG-GP ether = unsaturated archaetidic acid) corresponds to phosphatidic acid (the fatty acyl ester form of the phospholipid intermediate) in phospholipid biosynthesis of Escherichia coli, which is then activated by CTP to become CDP-diacylglycerol by the action of CTP-phosphatidate cytidyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.41) (7Carter Jr., J.R. J. Lipid Res. 1968; 9: 748-754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CDP-diacylglycerol plays a central role in the biosynthesis of a number of phospholipids in bacteria (8Dowhan W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although 2,3-GG-GP ether is the analogous intermediate of polar lipid biosynthesis in Archaea, its hydrocarbon chains are still highly unsaturated unlike the final products in which the chains are completely saturated. Therefore, one may reasonably expect to encounter hydrogenation, nucleotide activation, and polar group attachment in the archaeal polar lipid biosynthetic pathway, but their exact sequence of events is not known. In order to elucidate this pathway of polar lipid biosynthesis in Archaea, we began by looking for an enzyme capable of activating the unsaturated archaetidic acids by CTP. We found such activity in the methanogenic archaeon Methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus (formerly Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Ref. 9Wasserfallen A. Nöling J. Pfister P. Reeve J. Conway de Macario E. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2000; 50: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which catalyzed the formation of CDP-di-O-geranylgeranylglycerol (CDP-unsaturated archaeol) from CTP and 2,3-GG-GP ether (CTP:2,3-GG-GP ether cytidyltransferase,e.g. CDP-di-O-geranylgeranylglycerol synthase or CDP-archaeol synthase) according to Reaction 4, shown in Fig. 1. The enzymes catalyzing steps 1–3 in Fig.1 appear to be specific for G-1-P and derivatives of the same stereoconfiguration. The next question is whether this enzyme is also specific for archaeal lipids with G-1-P stereostructure possessing ether bonds. The present paper reports, for the first time, the characterization of CDP-archaeol synthase in M. thermoautotrophicus and comments upon the biosynthetic significance of the enzyme.

Unsaturated archaetidic acid and its analogs (14, 14′, 15, and16) were synthesized from geranylgeraniol (1, for the systematic name, see Table III), phytol (2, Funakoshi), or oleyl alcohol (3, Kanto Chemical Co.) and either 1-O-benzyl-sn-glycerol (4) or 3-O-benzyl-sn-glycerol (4′) (Funakoshi) as described (5Zhang D.L.

De-methylation conditions with trimethylsilyl bromide of 11, 11′, 12, and 13 were modified to 0 °C for 2 min because these compounds are labile under the original conditions (13Bittman R. Rosenthal A.F. Vargas L.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1984; 34: 201-205Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The final products (14, 14′, 15, and16), were purified by TLC using solvent A. Because of the lability of these allyl ether bond-containing compounds, the overall yield was always 6% or less. The intermediate products (8and 8′), di-O-geranylgeranyl glycerols, were confirmed by FAB-MS of the intact compounds and their fully hydrogenated derivatives. [α]D of 8 and8′ were +9.6° and −9.7°, respectively, which confirmed their stereostructure (10Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 101: 1007-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The identities of two of the final products, 2,3-GG-GP ether (14) and 1,2-di-O-geranylgeranyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (14′, 1,2-GG-GP ether), were confirmed by their molecular ions, m/z 740 (M + Na + H)+ and m/z715 (M − H)− respectively, as revealed by positive and negative FAB-MS. The phosphate group was assigned to thesn-1 position based upon the formation of digeranylgeranylglycerol from 2,3-GG-GP ether by the action of E. coli alkaline phosphatase (Sigma).

Saturated archaetidic acid with phytanyl chains, 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-1-phosphate (19, 2,3-phyta-GP ether) was prepared by phosphorylation of 2,3-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycerol (17, archaeol), with diphenylphosphoryl chloride (Tokyo Kasei, Japan) prepared from total lipid extract of H. salinarum cells (14Nishihara M.

Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 91-95Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), obtained from M. thermoautotrophicus, was co-chromatographed with product19 on one-dimensional TLC plates using solvents A (RF 0.41) and B (RF 0.73), and product 19 was also confirmed by m/z733 (M + H)+ of FAB-MS. Several kinds of phosphatidic acids (diacyl glycerophosphate) were synthesized by acylation of G-1-P prepared as described (14Nishihara M. Koga Y. J. Biochem.

The products (phosphatidic acids) were purified by CM52 carboxymethyl cellulose (Whatman) column chromatography and one-dimensional TLC with solvent A. The purified products were identified by co-chromatography with di-O-oleoyl-rac-GP (rac-ole-GP ester, Funakoshi) using solvent A (RF 0.40) and solvent B (RF 0.66), FAB-MS (m/z 743 (M − H)−) in the case of 2,3-di-O-geranylgeranioyl-G-1-P (2,3-GG-GP ester), 1,2-di-O-geranylgeranioyl-G-3-P (1,2-GG-GP ester),m/z 765 (M + Na − 2H)− in the case of di-O-geranylgeranioyl-rac-GP (rac-GG-GP ester), and m/z 699 (M − H)− for 2,3-di-O-oleoyl-G-1-P (2,3-ole-GP ester) and rac-ole-GP ester, and mild alkaline methanolysis (20Kates M.

Joo C.N. Can. J. Biochem. 1971; 49: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was used with cytidine 5′-monophosphomorpholidate to synthesize CDP-2,3-di-O-geranylgeranyl glycerol (CDP-unsaturated archaeol) and CDP-2,3-di-O-phytanyl glycerol (CDP-saturated archaeol) from 2,3-GG-GP ether and 2,3-phyta-GP ether. They were comigrated with the authentic CDP-dioleoylglycerol (Funakoshi) on TLC plates with solvents A (RF 0.37) and B (RF . 0.40). Positive FAB-MS analysis of the synthesized CDP-unsaturated archaeol revealed m/z 739 (M − CMP + Na + H)+, m/z 1021 (M)+, m/z 1043 (M − H + Na)+and m/z 1065 (M − 2H − 2Na)+. CDP-saturated archaeol prepared as above showed m/z 731 (M − CMP)− and m/z 1036 (M − H)− when analyzed by negative FAB-MS, which confirmed their structures. Frozen M. thermoautotrophicus or E. coli cells (equivalent to about 1.5 g, dry weight) were suspended in 10 ml of 0.2m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 1 mg of DNase (Sigma) and then passed through a French pressure cell operated at 1,400 kg/cm2. This process was repeated twice. In the case of the archaetidylserine synthase assay, 5 mmdithiothreitol was included prior to cell disruption. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by low speed centrifugation. The membrane fraction was obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 2 h. The pelleted membrane fraction was re-suspended in water (M. thermoautotrophicus) or in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (E. coli) and stored at −20 °C until further use. (a) For CDP-archaeol synthase, the complete assay mixture (final volume, 0.2 ml) contained the membrane fraction of M. thermoautotrophicus (200 μg of protein), 0.16 m Bicine buffer (Dojin Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan), pH 8.5, 0.5 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm lipid substrate, and 2 mm[5-3H]CTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 6.25 Ci/mol). After incubation at 55 °C for 2 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m HCl in methanol. Chloroform-extractable 3H material was then counted. (b) CDP-diacylglycerol synthase of E. coli was assayed as described by Sparrow (22Sparrow C.P. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). (c) For archaetidylserine synthase, the complete assay mixture (final volume 0.2 ml) contained 0.125 mmCDP-archaeol, 10 mml-[3-14C]serine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 1.25 Ci/mol), the cell-free homogenate of M. thermoautotrophicus (726 μg of protein), 0.125 mBicine buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mKCl, and 10 mm MnCl2. After incubation at 55 °C for 30 min, reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of 0.1 m HCl in methanol. Chloroform-extractable14C material was then counted. To obtain a fairly large amount of the enzyme reaction product for structural analysis, CDP-archaeol was enzymatically synthesized with 7.5 mg of 2,3-GG-GP ether, 4.8 mg of unlabeled CTP, and M. thermoautotrophicus membrane fraction (4.4 mg of protein). These reactants were incubated in the same buffer as the CDP-archaeol synthase assay (final volume, 5 ml) for 22 h. Since CDP-archaeol is soluble in an alkaline aqueous phase but soluble in the chloroform phase only under neutral or acidic conditions, the product was first extracted using the Bligh and Dyer solvent (23Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar) under an acidic condition followed by extraction into an alkaline aqueous layer. After removal of the lower organic layer, the aqueous solution was acidified slightly with diluted HCl and re-extracted by the Bligh and Dyer method (acidic-alkaline partitioning). Most cellular phospholipids remained in the chloroform fraction while highly acidic lipids, such as CDP-archaeol and archaetidylserine, were extracted into the aqueous phase under alkaline conditions. The product was finally purified by TLC with solvent B. Phosphate (24Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and protein (25Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzaro M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar) were determined as described previously. CDP-archaeol was hydrolyzed with 5% HCl-methanol at 80 °C for 1 h. Equal volumes of chloroform and water were added to the reaction mixture, and the two layers were separated. A portion of the aqueous product was dried under a stream of nitrogen. The resulting residue was dissolved in 0.01 m HCl. UV spectra (220–320 nm) of this solution were recorded by a Shimadzu UV-2200A spectrophotometer at pH 2 and 13. Cytidine was determined by the measurement of A 280 at pH 2 (ε = 12800). FAB-MS was recorded with a mass spectrometer (JEOL JMS DX-303) with a matrix ofm-nitrobenzyl alcohol in a positive and/or a negative mode. In the case of CDP-unsaturated archaeol, the matrix contained a small amount of NaI. Optical rotation was measured at room temperature at 589 nm with an automatic digital polarimeter (PM-201, Photal, Japan). Radioactivity was counted using a liquid scintillation spectrometer (Aloka LSC-3500E, Japan) with Aquasol-2 (Packard) as scintillator. At the midlog phase of growth of M. thermoautotrophicus grown in 50 ml of the low phosphate medium (26Nishihara M. Morii H. Koga Y. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 95-102Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), 1 mCi of [32P]Pi (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 50 Ci/mol) was added and the culture was allowed to continue to grow. After 60 min the cells were harvested, and unlabeled CDP-unsaturated archaeol was added (60 μg/10 mg cells). Total lipid was extracted, and the CDP-archaeol-containing fraction was roughly purified by the acidic-alkaline partitioning method described above. A quarter of the final acidic chloroform fraction was developed on two-dimensional TLC with solvent A twice in the first direction and with solvent B once in the second direction. A radioactive spot that was superimposable with the molybdate-positive spot of carrier CDP-archaeol was detected among a number of radioactive spots on the TLC. A cell-free homogenate ofM. thermoautotrophicus catalyzed the conversion of [3H]CTP to chloroform-extractable material. Under assay conditions, incorporation of radioactivity into a lipid form continued almost linearly for at least 10 h, and then gradually slowed down (Fig. 3). In routine assays, the incubation time was 2 h. The activity was entirely dependent on the lipid substrate (2,3-GG-GP ether) and required the addition of Mg2+ and K+ ions (TableI). Maximal enzyme activity was observed at pH 8.5 and 55 °C (Fig. 4,A and B) when 0.5 m K+and 1–2 mm Mg2+ were added (Fig. 4,C and D). Under these conditions, radioactivity recovered in chloroform fraction after incubation was proportional to the amount of added membrane fraction protein (0–220 μg) (data not shown). Dithiothreitol showed no effect on the activity. Enzyme activity was inhibited 96% by 0.1% Triton X-100. The membrane fraction contained 92% of total activity found in the cell-free homogenate of M. thermoautotrophicus. The membrane fraction was able to be stored for several months at −20 °C without significant loss of activity. Freezing and thawing caused a small loss (5–10%) of activity.Table IIncorporation of [ 3 H]CTP into lipid by the membrane fraction of M. thermoautotrophicusReaction mixture[3H]CTP incorporated into lipidnmolComplete3.6− 2,3-GG-GP ether0.01− Membrane fraction0.08− Membrane fraction + heated membrane fraction 1-aThe membrane fraction was heated in a boiling water bath for 30 min.0.09− MgCl20.00− KCl0.14The complete reaction mixture contained the membrane fraction, 2 mm 2,3-GG-GP ether, and 2 mm[5-3H]CTP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After incubation at 55 °C for 2 h, the reaction was stopped and3H in chloroform-extractable material was counted.1-a The membrane fraction was heated in a boiling water bath for 30 min.

The3H-labeled product in the chloroform extract of the reaction mixture was chromatographed on TLC. Most of the applied radioactivity (90%) was recovered in a single spot, which co-migrated with authentic CDP-1,2-dioleoyl-rac-glycerol with solvents A (RF 0.37) and B (RF 0.39), respectively. The reaction product was also chemically and mass-spectrometrically analyzed. For this purpose 26 times more substrate (2,3-GG-GP ether, 7.5 mg) was used for the prolonged reaction with unlabeled CTP, and 1.2 mg of the purified product was obtained. The FAB-mass spectrum of the product gave signals of m/z 739 (M − CMP + Na + H)+, m/z 1021 (M)+, m/z1043 (M − H + Na)+, and m/z 1065 (M − 2H + 2Na)+ in the positive ion mode. The product was completely hydrolyzed by 5% HCl-methanol at 80 °C for 2 h without forming any phosphate-containing, chloroform-soluble materials. This is probably because the core lipid portion of CDP-archaeol is acid-labile. Water-soluble materials of the hydrolysate were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer solvent. UV spectra (220–320 nm) of the aqueous fraction showed typical spectra of cytidine at pH 2 and 13. The molar ratio of cytidine and total phosphate in the aqueous fraction was 1:2.1 (Table II). When chemically synthesized CDP-unsaturated archaeol (M r = 1021) was treated as above, identical results were obtained. However, when CDP-saturated archaeol was hydrolyzed under the same conditions, a chloroform-soluble phosphate-containing compound, chromatographically identical to archaetidic acid, was formed. In this case, the ratio of cytidine, water-soluble phosphate, and chloroform-soluble phosphate was 1:1.20:1.17 (Table II). These results suggest that enzymatically synthesized CDP-archaeol still contains two acid-labile allyl ether bonds but no acid-stable ether bonds. In other words, it possesses two geranylgeranyl ether bonds.Table IIHydrolysis products of CDP-archaeolsCDP-archaeolCytidinePhosphateWater-solubleChloroform-solubleChemically synthesized saturated11.201.17Chemically synthesized unsaturated11.96ND 2-aNot determined because no phosphate-positive material was detected on TLC.Enzymatically synthesized12.10NDCDP-archaeols were hydrolyzed in 5% HCl-methanol at 80 °C for 1 h.

The products were partitioned between aqueous and chloroform layers using the Bligh and Dyer solvent. 2,3-GG-GP ether (1.14 mg) was incubated with CTP and the membrane fraction of M. thermoautotrophicus at 55 °C for 15 h. Before and after the incubation, 2,3-GG-GP ether and CTP were measured by phosphate determination after separation by TLC of the chloroform-soluble fraction and UV measurement of the aqueous fraction, respectively. CDP-archaeol was determined by phosphate determination after separation by TLC of the chloroform-soluble fraction and UV measurement of the aqueous fraction after hydrolysis of the chloroform-soluble fraction. The decrease in mass of the reactants was 49 nmol (2,3-GG-GP ether) and 46 nmol (CTP). There was a concomitant increase of the product of CDP-archaeol. This was determined to be 38 nmol by spectrophotometric measurement or 43 nmol by phosphate determination. These results establish the stoichiometry of the reaction. Archaeal glycerolipids are fundamentally characterized by the G-1-P stereostructure of their backbone. Substrate stereospecificity of the enzymes involved in polar lipid biosynthesis is therefore of special interest. To examine this issue, we synthesized a variety of substrate analogs with ether or ester bonds between GP and both unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons, and with both stereoisomers of the GP backbone. Table III shows relative activities of the enzyme in the presence of 2 mm of each of the substrate analogs. Both enantiomers of archaetidic acid possessing geranylgeranyl chains (2,3-GG-GP ether and 1,2-GG-GP ether) showed similar activities as a substrate for the enzyme. In contrast to the stereostructure of GP backbone, unsaturation of the hydrocarbon chains of these substrates was critical; archaetidic acid with saturated (2,3-phyta-GP ether) or monounsaturated (2,3-phyto-GP ether) isoprenoid chains of the same carbon number were poor substrates as were analogs with monounsaturated straight chains (2,3-ole-GP ether), even though they had the same stereostructure as the fully active natural substrate (2,3-GG-GP ether). As to the ester analogs of the substrate, the GP esters with geranylgeranioyl chains again showed high activities. In this case, the 1,2-GG analog showed a half-maximal activity. The activi"

HMG-1, like its individual HMG boxes, can recognize structural distortion of DNA, such as four-way DNA junctions (4WJs), that are very likely to have features common to their natural, yet unknown, cellular binding targets. HMG-1 can also bend/loop DNA and introduce negative supercoils in the presence of topoisomerase I in topologically closed DNAs. Results of our gel shift assays demonstrate that mutation of Arg97 within the extended N-terminal strand of the B domain significantly (>50-fold) decreases affinity of the HMG box for 4WJs and alters the mode of binding without changing the structural specificity for 4WJs. Several basic amino acids of the extended N-terminal strand (Lys96/Arg97) and helix I (Arg110/Lys114) of the B domain participate in DNA binding and supercoiling. The putative intercalating hydrophobic Phe103 of helix I is important for DNA supercoiling but dispensable for binding to supercoiled DNA and 4WJs. We conclude that the B domain of HMG-1 can tolerate substitutions of a number of amino acid residues without abolishing the structure-specific recognition of 4WJs, whereas mutations of most of these residues severely impair the topoisomerase I-mediated DNA supercoiling and change the sign of supercoiling from negative to positive.

The tertiary structure of the DNA-binding domains of all of the HMG-1 box proteins investigated so far is remarkably similar and is more evolutionarily conserved than the amino acid sequences of the HMG-1 box domains (3Baxevanis A.D.

Although HMG-1 and -2 proteins (or the individual HMG-1/2 box domains) bind DNA irrespective of sequence, they are able to recognize and bind preferentially to bent or distorted DNA structures such as four-way DNA junctions (4WJs),1supercoiled DNA, and kinked and underwound (cisplatin-modified) DNA (9Pil P.M.

In addition to the ability of HMG-1/2 to bind non-B-DNA structures, the proteins can induce (in the presence of topoisomerase I) negative supercoils in topologically closed domains of DNA, stabilize DNA loops in complex nucleoprotein structures, and facilitate binding of certain sequence-specific proteins to their target DNA (11Sheflin L.G.

In this work, we have introduced mutations into the B domain of HMG-1 to assess the functional importance of a number of highly conserved residues, including the putative intercalating hydrophobic Phe103 of helix I, for the ability of the HMG-1 box domain to introduce supercoils in topologically closed DNA (in the presence of topoisomerase I) and to bind 4WJs. We have shown that the B domain of HMG-1 can tolerate a number of (mainly) nonconservative residue substitutions without loosing the ability to bind four-way DNA junctions in a structure-specific manner. On the other hand, mutations of most of these residues can drastically impair the topoisomerase I-mediated DNA supercoiling by the B domain and change the sign of supercoiling from negative to positive. Our data further indicate that hydrophobic Phe103 is required for DNA supercoiling (or protection of supercoiled DNA from relaxation by topoisomerase I), but it is dispensable for binding of the B domain to negatively supercoiled DNA or 4WJs. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or Promega. Other reagents were of the highest purity either from Sigma or Fluka. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cDNA encoding B domain of HMG-1 (residues 92–180) was amplified by PCR using rat hmg-1 cDNA and specific primers 5′-TCGAGGGATCCATGCCCAATGCCCCCAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAGGTCGACCTACTTCTCAGCCTTGACCAC-3′ (antisense) (the initiation and termination codons are underlined). The PCR primers contained restriction sites for BamHI and SalI, as well as the initiation and termination codons (underlined). The PCR protocol was as described previously (34Štros M. Nishikawa S. Dixon G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with the following modification of the PCR cycles: 94 °C for 4 min (denaturation cycle); 94 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 20 s, 72 °C for 40 s (30 cycles); and 72 °C for 7 min (extension cycle). The amplified HMG box domain was purified on a 1% agarose gel, blunt-ended by T4 DNA polymerase and cloned into the SmaI site of the plasmid pAlter-1 (Promega). The ligated plasmid was transformed by electroporation and propagated in JM 109 cells. Plasmids carrying the HMG box domain were selected on LB plates containing ampicillin and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal)/isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the positive (white) clones were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method using Sequenase kit version 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmids harboring the rat HMG-1 box B or AB didomain (pARHMG1b or pARHMG1b7) were recloned between theBamHI and SalI sites of the pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) expression vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with pARHMG1b plasmid using the protocol of the Altered Sites II Kit (Promega). Briefly, denaturated pARHMG1b (i.e, pAlter-1 plasmid harboring the HMG box B domain of rat HMG-1 and carrying the tetracycline resistance) was annealed with a tetracycline knockout and an ampicillin repair oligonucleotide as well as with one of the 5′-phosphorylated mismatched B domain-specific primers as described previously (21Štros M. Reich J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, K96A and R97A mutants of the B domain were constructed using the following mismatched primers: K96A, CCCAATGCCCCCGCGAGGCCTCCTTCG, or R97A, CCCAATGCCCCCAAGGCGCCTCCTTCGGCC (mutated codons are in bold type). After second-strand synthesis, the ampicillin-resistant clones were dideoxy-sequenced to verify the presence of the introduced mutation. The BamHI/SalI fragments carrying the B domain mutants were then cloned between the BamHI andSalI sites of the pGEX-T41 expression vector and the pGRHMG1boxB(mutant) plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli JM 109 strain. For the expression of the B domain or its mutants in E. coli, the plasmids were propagated in BL21 cells (Novagen). Cultures of BL21 cells (Novagen) harboring the pGRHMG1boxB, pGRHMG1boxB(mutants) or pGRHMG1(AB) plasmids were grown as described previously (15Štros M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10355-10361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Štros M. Reich J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were then briefly sonicated and centrifuged, and the clear supernatant was loaded on glutathione-Sepharose 4B columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The columns were then washed three times with 20 ml of the phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The column-bound expressed fusion proteins of the glutathionine S-transferase with HMG polypeptides were cleaved with 2.5 units of thrombin in 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline buffer at room temperature overnight, and the released HMG polypeptides were purified to near homogeneity by fast protein liquid chromatography chromatography on a MonoS column (17Štros M. Reich J. Kolı́balová A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purity of HMG boxes was routinely checked on SDS/18% polyacrylamide gels (35Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar) that were stained with 0.25% Coomassie Blue R-250. The recombinant HMG box 1 ofxUBF was purified as described previously (36Štros M. Cherny D. Jovin T.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4088-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Synthetic Holliday 4WJs were constructed using the published protocol (10Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Briefly, the following oligonucleotides were synthesized (from 5′ to 3′): strand 1, CCCTATAACCCCTGCATTGAATTCCAGTCTGATAA; strand 2, GTAGTCGTGATAGGTGCAGGGGTTATAGGG; strand 3, AACAGTAGCTCTTATTCGAGCTCGCGCCCTATCACGACTA; and strand 4, TTTATCAGACTGGAATTCAAGCGCGAGCTCGAATAAGAGCTACTGT. The 4WJs were prepared by annealing of the strands 1–4, followed by purification of the junctions on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The identity of the 4WJs was verified by separation of aliquots of gel purified complexes (subsequently labeled at 5′-termini) on denaturing sequencing gels. The DNA binding experiments were carried out typically with ∼1.5 nm32P-labeled four-way DNA junction (see the legends for figures) and different amounts of HMG box polypeptides (∼0.1–10 μm) in the absence or presence of 20- or 1000-fold mass excess of unlabeled linear double-stranded DNA (EcoRI-linearized plasmid pBluescript II KS+) over the junctions in a final volume of 12 μl. The DNA binding buffer (+ Mg2+) was 3.5% Ficoll, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm spermidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. In some cases the DNA binding buffer (− Mg2+) was used (3.5% Ficoll, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mmHepes-KOH, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm spermidine, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The samples were incubated on ice for 20 min, loaded onto vertical (0.7 mm thick) 5.8% polyacrylamide slab gels (29:1, acrylamide to bis-acrylamide mass ratio) in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris base, 45 mm boric acid, 1.25 mm EDTA), and subjected to electrophoresis at 10 V/cm for approximately 5 h at 4 °C. The gels were then vacuum-dried and autoradiographed (Fuji RX x-ray films) with intensifying screens at −70 °C for 15–18 h. The intensities of complexes I and II were quantified by scanning the individual bands using a Molecular Dynamics SI laser scanning densitometer. The obtained data were processed with ImageQuant 4.1 software and presented as approximate values based on two or three independent experiments. Negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA (final concentration, ∼170 μg/ml) was relaxed in high salt relaxation buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 20 37 glycerol, 1 mmdithiothreitol; Promega) with wheat germ topoisomerase I (4 units/μg DNA; Promega) at 37 °C for 90 min. The relaxed DNA was then diluted (either in 1× high salt relaxation buffer or in the same buffer containing only 10 mm NaCl, referred to as low salt relaxation buffer), and a second portion of the enzyme was added. The DNA mixture was then divided into several tubes, each containing 150 or 225 ng of DNA and the HMG peptides (as indicated in the legends to figures) and adjusted to a final volume of 10 μl. The reactions were allowed to proceed for 1 h at 37 °C, after which 2.5 μl of the termination mix (5× TBE, 5% SDS, 15% sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylencyanol, 1 μg/μl proteinase K) were added, and the samples were subjected to further incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA (150 or 220 ng/reaction) was incubated with increasing amounts of the HMG polypeptides in high salt relaxation buffer for 20 min on ice. This was followed by incubation of the mixture at 37 °C for 5 min before addition of topoisomerase I (4 units/μg DNA). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 1 h before termination as indicated for the supercoiling assay. DNA topoisomers were then resolved in the first dimension on 1% agarose gels in 0.5× TBE buffer at ∼3 V/cm for 17 h. To determine the sign of supercoiling, the gels were soaked in chloroquine (2.5 μg/ml) for 1 h, turned horizontally by 90° and resolved in the second dimension in 0.5× TBE containing chloroquine at ∼5 V/cm for 10 h. The gels were stained with 10,000-fold diluted Sybr® Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene), followed by visualization of the DNA topoisomers under UV illumination (254 nm). The HMG boxes (60–100 μm) were extensively dialyzed against a low salt CD buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) for measurements of CD spectra. CD spectra of the B domain and its mutants (with the exception of the K53E mutant, the CD spectra of which could not be measured because of insufficient yields after purification from E. coli) were recorded in low salt CD buffer or high salt CD buffer containing 200 mm NaCl (base-line buffers). In experiments studying the effect of competitor (linear) DNA on the α-helical structure of the Y155S mutant, linearized pBluescript plasmid was added to the HMG box polypeptide in high salt CD buffer (the amount of competitor DNA corresponded to 20-fold mass excess over the 4WJs in Fig. 2). All CD spectra were recorded using Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter with a 1-mm path length cuvette at approximately 20 °C over the range of 195–260 nm (resolution step 0.5 nm), each of the spectra representing the average of seven scans. CD spectrum of protein-free linearized plasmid DNA in high salt CD buffer was regarded as a base-line spectrum. After the base-line subtraction, the CD spectra were calculated using the J700 program provided by the manufacturer and finally subjected to noise reduction. All CD spectra are presented as molar ellipticity values (Θ). The aim of this paper was to carry out mutational analysis of the central domain of the chromosomal protein HMG-1 (the “HMG box B” or “B domain”) to identify amino acid residues involved in structure-specific binding to 4WJs or DNA unwinding (supercoiling) in the presence of topoisomerase I. We have selected amino acid residues of the HMG-1 B domain (Fig.1) as targets for site-directed mutagenesis based on the published three-dimensional structure of the HMG-1 B domain, evolutionary conservation, as well as NMR structures of HMG-DNA complexes and other data (see below). Briefly, residues Lys96 and Arg97 are present within the highly conserved motif PKRP of the N-terminal segment of both the non-sequence-specific HMG box proteins and the sequence-specific HMG box proteins, and the previously published mutagenesis analysis of different HMG boxes, a domain swap as well as the data from NMR structures of HMG-DNA complexes (7Jones D.N.M.

https://openalex.org/W2328945272,"Hepatocyte growth factor triggers a complex biological program leading to invasive cell growth by activating the c-Met receptor tyrosine kinase. Following activation, Met signaling is elicited via its interactions with SH2-containing proteins, or via the phosphorylation of the docking protein Gab1, and the subsequent interaction of Gab1 with additional SH2-containing effector molecules. We have previously shown that the interaction between phosphorylated Gab1 and the adaptor protein Crk mediates activation of the JNK pathway downstream of Met. We report here that c-Cbl, which is a Gab1-like docking protein, also becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to Met activation and serves as a docking molecule for various SH2-containing molecules, including Crk. We further show that Cbl is similarly capable of enhancing Met-induced JNK activation, and several lines of experimentation suggests that it does so by interacting with Crk. We also show that both Cbl and Gab1 enhance Met-induced activation of another MAP kinase cascade, the ERK pathway, in a Crk-independent manner. Taken together, our studies demonstrate a previously unidentified functional role for Cbl in Met signaling and suggest that Met utilizes at least two docking proteins, Gab1 and Cbl, to activate downstream signaling pathways.

A and P site-bound tRNAs, whose 3′ termini reside in the peptidyl transferase center, label primarily nucleotides U2506 and U2585 and protein L27. In contrast, E site-bound tRNA labels nucleotide C2422 and protein L33. The cross-linking patterns confirm the topographical separation of the peptidyl transferase center from the E site domain. The relative amounts of label incorporated into the universally conserved residues U2506 and U2585 depend on the occupancy of the A and P sites by different tRNA ligands and indicates that these nucleotides play a pivotal role in peptide transfer. In particular, the 3′-adenosine of the peptidyl-tRNA analogue, AcPhe-tRNAPhe, remains in close contact with U2506 regardless of whether its anticodon is located in the A site or P site. Our findings, therefore, modify and extend the hybrid state model of tRNA-ribosome interaction. We show that the 3′-end of the deacylated tRNA that is formed after transpeptidation does not immediately progress to the E site but remains temporarily in the peptidyl transferase center. In addition, we demonstrate that the E site, defined by the labeling of nucleotide C2422 and protein L33, represents an intermediate state of binding that precedes the entry of deacylated tRNA into the F (final) site from which it dissociates into the cytoplasm.

N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNAPhe polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis elongation factor Tu guanylyl-imidodiphosphate Knowledge of the molecular events that take place during protein synthesis has been greatly influenced by studies demonstrating that aminoacyl-tRNA, peptidyl-tRNA, and deacylated tRNA are accommodated on the ribosome at the A, P, and E sites, respectively (reviewed in Ref.1Wower J. Zimmermann R.A. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 961-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The three-site model of translation has been modified to include three hybrid binding states, designated A/T, A/P, and P/E, which are adopted by tRNA during its passage through the ribosome (2Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Our earlier photoaffinity labeling studies, which focused primarily on the identification of ribosomal proteins contacted by the 3′ end and anticodon of tRNA as it transits the ribosome, allowed us to propose a model for the arrangement of the A, P, and E-site tRNAs on the Escherichia coli ribosome (3Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Wower J. Scheffer P. Sylvers L.A. Wintermeyer W. Zimmermann R.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 617-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this model, the tRNA molecules are positioned so that their 3′ ends are directed toward the peptidyl transferase center of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, while their anticodons point toward the groove between the head and the body of the 30 S ribosomal subunit where they interact with complementary codons in the mRNA. Relative to the 50 S subunit interface, the A-site tRNA is located on the L7/L12 or “right” side, the E site tRNA is placed near the L1 protuberance on the “left” side, and the P- site tRNA occupies the space between them. A similar model was proposed by Noller et al. (5Noller H.F. Moazed D. Stern S. Powers T. Allen P.N. Robertson J.M. Weiser B. Triman K. Hill W.E. Dahlberg A. Garrett R.A. Moore P.B. Schlessinger D.

An alternative arrangement for E site-bound tRNA, designated as the E2 site, has been proposed on the basis of cryo-electron microscopy (6Agrawal R.K. Penczek P. Grassucci R.A. Li Y. Leith A.

This tRNA binding state most likely corresponds to the E site tRNA visualized by x-ray crystallography (8Cate J.H. Yusupov M.M. Yusupova G.Zh. Earnest T.N. Noller H.F. Science. 1999; 285: 2095-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Many lines of evidence indicate that the 23 S rRNA is involved in essential ribosomal functions (10Noller H.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 122-191Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 11Muth G.W. Ortoleva-Donnelly L. Strobel S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Now that the position of tRNA molecules can be visualized relative to the structure of the ribosome, determining the topography of tRNA-23 S rRNA contacts on the level of individual nucleotides is crucial for interpreting the images provided by cryo-electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography as well as for constructing high resolution models of the different functional states of the ribosome. In the present work, we follow the movement of the 3′ terminus of tRNA as it transits the E. coli ribosome during the elongation cycle of translation using photoreactive tRNA probes and characterize the interactions of tRNA with the 23 S rRNA at the nucleotide level. The sources of tRNAs, enzymes, and radioactively labeled compounds were as described previously (4Wower J. Scheffer P. Sylvers L.A. Wintermeyer W. Zimmermann R.A.

Occupation of the P site by Ac[14C]Phe-[5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhewas verified by its reactivity with puromycin (21Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 57-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Except as noted, tRNA binding and cross-linking experiments were carried out in TNME buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm EDTA). Cross-linking was accomplished by irradiating non-covalent tRNA-ribosome complexes for 2 min at 0 °C in a Rayonet Model RPR-100 photochemical reactor equipped with six RPR-3000-Å lamps (13Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8114-8121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On average, 9–13% of the non-covalently bound (2N3A76)tRNAPhe became covalently cross-linked to the ribosomes under our conditions (3Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sites in the 23 S rRNA labeled by (2N3A76)tRNAPhe were identified by treatment with RNase H in the presence of selected pairs of oligodeoxyribonucleotides (23Brimacombe R. Greuer B. Gulle H.

The oligodeoxyribonucleotides used in these assays were complementary to sequences within the 23 S rRNA encompassing nucleotides 2776–2790 (oligo 1), 2616–2630 (oligo 2), 2582–2597 (oligo 2a), 2563–2577 (oligo 3), 2532–2546 (oligo 3a), 2492–2506 (oligo 3b), 2438–2452 (oligo 4), 2354–2368 (oligo 4a), 2229–2243 (oligo 5), 2110–2124 (oligo 5a), 2084–2098 (oligo 6), 2050–2064 (oligo 6a), 2018–2032 (oligo 7), 1983–1997 (oligo 7a), 1903–1917 (oligo 8), 1806–1820 (oligo 8a), 1703–1717 (oligo 9), 2570–2591 (oligo 10), 2489–2522 (oligo 11), 2497–2512 (oligo 12), 2448–2468 (oligo 13), 2416–2443 (oligo 14), 2402–2434 (oligo 15), 2385–2408 (oligo 16), 2362–2381 (oligo 17), 2058–2080 (oligo 18), 1951–1980 (oligo 19), 1931–1957 (oligo 20), and 1923–1947 (oligo 21). 50 S-subunit proteins cross-linked to (2N3A76)tRNAPhe were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE (13Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8114-8121Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The labeling of proteins L27 and L33 was established earlier by immunological methods (3Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Irradiation of 2-azidoadenosine with near-UV light induces very short cross-links to adjacent molecules and can therefore provide precise information on the molecular environment of the photoreactive base (27Sylvers L.A. Wower J. Bioconjug. Chem. 1993; 4: 411-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Replacement of the 3′-terminal adenosine of yeast tRNAPhe with 2-azidoadenosine yields a photoreactive derivative, (2N3A76)tRNAPhe, which can be aminoacylated by yeast phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase and bound toE. coli ribosomes (14Sylvers L. Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present work, we describe the preparation of 32P-labeled (2N3A76)tRNAPhe derivatives and their incorporation into ribosomal complexes representing different stages in the translation elongation cycle. The photoreactive and non-photoreactive tRNA derivatives usually contained 3H or14C labels in either the aminoacyl moiety or the 3′-terminal nucleotide to verify site occupancy and puromycin reactivity (Table I and “Experimental Procedures”). Identification of the cross-linking sites allowed us to delineate the path followed by the 3′ terminus of the tRNA during its transit through the ribosome.Table ISegments and nucleotides of 23 S rRNA labeled by (2N3A76)tRNA derivatives bound to the A, R, P, and E sites on the E. coli ribosomeA siteP siteE sitePoly(U)Nucleotides labeledRNA segments labeledMajorMinorH segmentsF segmentsT segments(pmol of tRNA/pmol of 70 S)(2N3A)tRNA+U2585U2506H1 > H2F1, F2aT11, T12(0.64)AcPhe-(2N3A)tRNA+U2506G2069,H2 > H1 > H4F1, F2a, F4T11, T12, T18(0.53)U2585AcPhe-(2N3A)tRNA−U2506G2069,H2 > H1 > H4F1, F2a, F2b, F4T11, T12, T13, T18(0.51)C2452, U2585AcPhe-tRNA(2N3A)tRNA+U2585H1F1T11(1.22) 1-aSome tRNA also bound to other sites.(0.59)Phe-(2N3A)tRNAtRNA+U2585U2506H1 > H2F1, F2aT11, T12(0.43)(1.10) 1-aSome tRNA also bound to other sites.Phe-(2N3A)tRNAtRNA+U2585U1926,H1 > H2 > H5F1, F2a, F5T11, T12, T19, T20(0.41) 1-bPhe-tRNA bound to ribosomal A/T or R site as ternary complex with EF-Tu and GMPPNP.(0.89)U2506AcPhe-(2N3A)tRNAtRNA+U2506U2585H2 > H1F1, F2aT11, T12(0.33)(0.53)AcPhe-tRNAAcPhe-tRNA(2N3A)tRNA+C2422H3F3T14, T15(1.41)(0.15)(2N3A)tRNA(2N3A)tRNA(2N3A)tRNA+C2422,U1926,H1–H5F1–F5T11–T20(2.38)U2506, U2585G2069Binding data represent averages calculated from three to five independent cross-linking experiments and are expressed in pmol of tRNA/pmol of 705 ribosomes.

To simulate P-site complexes containing tRNA in the pre- and post-transpeptidation states of binding, Ac[14C]Phe-[5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPheand [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe were individually bound to poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosomes (Fig. 1,a and b). Occupancy of the P site by Ac[14C]Phe-[5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhewas confirmed by its quantitative reaction with puromycin. For EF-Tu·GTP-dependent binding to the A site, [14C]Phe-[5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhewas bound to poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosomes in which the P site was blocked by deacylated E. coli[14C]tRNAPhe. To retain [14C]Phe-[5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhein the R or A/T site (2Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 28Lake J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

During the elongation phase of protein synthesis, the ribosome oscillates between the pre- and post-translocational states. Pre-translocational complexes were formed by the non-enzymatic binding of Ac[14C]Phe-[5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPheto the A site of poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosomes in which the P site was filled with deacylated E. coli[14C]tRNAPhe (see Fig. 1 d) or of Ac[3H]Phe-tRNAPhe to the A site of poly(U)-programmed 70 S ribosomes in which the P site was filled with deacylated [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe (see Fig.1 e). Comparison of the latter state with that depicted in Fig. 1 a was expected to show whether the binding of tRNA to the A site influences the arrangement of tRNA in the P site. E site complexes were formed by binding deacylated [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe to poly(U)-programmed ribosomes under conditions in which both the A and P sites were blocked with Ac[14C]Phe-tRNAPhe(see Fig. 1 f) (29Kirillov S.V. Semenkov Yu. P. FEBS Lett. 1982; 148: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The finding that poly(U)-programmed E. coli ribosomes can bind three molecules of deacylated tRNAPhe in vitro was crucial for the development of the three-site model of the ribosome, which suggests that tRNAs bind successively to the A, P, and E sites during the elongation cycle (30Kirillov S.V. Makarov E.M. Semenkov Yu. P. FEBS Lett. 1983; 157: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31Lill R. Robertson J.M. Wintermeyer W.

Therefore, we examined the pattern of cross-linking in the presence of saturating amounts of deacylated [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe in addition to the complexes described above (Fig. 1 g). Each tRNA-ribosome complex was irradiated with 300-nm lamps to induce cross-linking (3Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Separation of the tRNA-ribosome complexes into 30 S and 50 S subunit fractions by centrifugation at low Mg2+concentration demonstrated that the tRNA derivatives cross-linked exclusively to the 50 S subunit. Subsequent analysis of the covalent tRNA-50 S subunit complexes on a sucrose gradient containing SDS showed that the cross-links are distributed between the 23 S rRNA and the 50 S subunit proteins. As we have previously reported (3Wower J. Hixson S.S. Zimmermann R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5232-5236Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 4Wower J. Scheffer P. Sylvers L.A.

Nucleic Acids Symp. 1999; 41: 187-191Google Scholar), A and P site-bound (2N3A76)tRNAPhe and its aminoacylated derivatives primarily label protein L27, whereas E site-bound (2N3A76)tRNAPhe labels proteins L33 and L1. The sites to which (2N3A76)tRNAPhecross-links on the 23 S rRNA were determined by a combination of three approaches, RNase H cleavage, RNase protection, and primer extension, as outlined in Fig. 2. Covalent [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe-23 S rRNA complexes were digested with RNase H in the presence of pairs of 15-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotides complementary to sequences located approximately 100–250 nucleotides apart in the primary structure of the 23 S rRNA (for a list of oligonucleotides see “Experimental Procedures”). Cleavage of the rRNA at sites that bracket the cross-link releases a fragment, which is tagged by covalently attached [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe or its derivatives and can be readily detected by denaturing PAGE (Fig. 1). Such “scans” of the covalent tRNA-23 S rRNA complexes revealed five labeled segments within domains IV and V of the 23 S rRNA, which encompass nucleotides 2567–2904 (segment H1), 2446–2568 (segment H2), 2237–2445 (segment H3), 2025–2092 (segment H4), and 1910–2024 (segment H5). The specific pattern of cross-linking depended on the conditions under which the photoreactive tRNAs were bound to the ribosome (Fig. 1). To delineate the sites of cross-linking more narrowly, [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe-23 S rRNA complexes were subjected to further RNase H digestions using pairs of oligodeoxynucleotides that differed from those used in the initial scan. Products of these digestions, denoted F fragments, were fractionated by denaturing PAGE (Figs. 2 and3 a). This step was followed by RNase protection analysis in which complementary oligodeoxynucleotides were hybridized to the F regions of the 23 S rRNA and the resulting heteroduplexes were digested with RNase T1. Protected fragments that retained the 32P label derived from cross-linked [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe moieties, designated T fragments, delimited the sites of cross-linking to sequences of the 23 S RNA ranging from 10 to 20 nucleotides in length (Figs. 2 and 3 b). Final identification of the cross-linking sites was carried out using the primer extension method (26Moazed D. Stern S. Noller H.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 399-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For this purpose, fragments of approximately 250 nucleotides spanning each of the five cross-linking sites in the 23 S rRNA were excised from the appropriate [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe-23 S rRNA complexes with RNase H, separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as in Fig. 1 and subjected to primer extension analysis (Fig. 3,c and d). When tRNA-23 S rRNA complexes containing tRNA cross-links to H1 were digested with RNase H in the presence of oligonucleotides 2, 2a, and 3, all of which resulted in the excision of 3′-terminal segments of 23 S rRNA, only the longest was tagged by [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe (Figs. 2and 3 a). The cross-link site must therefore be located within fragment F1, which encompasses nucleotides 2567–2590. RNase T1 protection analysis showed that oligonucleotide 10 protected [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe-tagged subfragment T10, which corresponds to nucleotides 2570–2592 (Figs. 2and 3 b). The only new primer extension stop within this sequence is at U2586 (Figs. 3 c and4), one nucleotide before the cross-link site. Covalent tRNA-23 S rRNA complexes, in which [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhelabeled segment H2, were cleaved with RNase H in the presence of oligonucleotides 3, 3a, 3b, and 4. Inspection of the radioactively labeled sequences released in this assay revealed that the cross-link site is located within fragment F2a, which spans nucleotides 2499–2539 (Fig. 2). RNase T1 protection experiments revealed that subfragment T11, which corresponds to nucleotides 2488–2524, retained the [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe tag (Figs. 2 and 3 b). Primer extension analysis identified the cross-linked nucleotide as U2506 (Fig. 3 d). When a similar analysis was carried out on tRNA-23 S rRNA complexes prepared from ribosomes in the absence of poly(U), two sites of cross-linking were identified within segment H2. One of them was located within fragment F2a and corresponded to U2506, whereas the other was found to be in fragment F2b, which encompasses nucleotides 2446–2498 (Fig. 2). The site of attachment within F2b was determined by primer extension to be C2452. RNase H cleavage of all tRNA-23 S rRNA complexes in which tRNA was cross-linked to H3 in the presence of the oligonucleotide pairs 4/4a and 4a/5 demonstrated that the site of cross-linking is located in fragment F3, which encompasses nucleotides 2360–2445 (Fig. 2). This portion of the complex was further analyzed by RNase T1 protection using oligonucleotides 14, 15, 16, and 17. Because oligonucleotides 14 and 15 protected two overlapping [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe-labeled subfragments, denoted T14 and T15 in Fig. 2, the site of cross-linking must be located between nucleotides 2415 and 2436. The nucleotide covalently attached to the tRNA was determined to be C2422 by primer extension analysis. RNase H digestion of tRNA-23 S rRNA complexes containing tRNA cross-linked to segment H4 in the presence of oligonucleotides pairs 5/6, 5/6a, 5/7, and 6a/7a showed that the cross-link is located in fragment F4, between nucleotides 2024 and 2091 (Fig. 2). RNase T1 protection experiments utilizing oligonucleotide 18 localized the cross-linking site to the sequence encompassing nucleotides 2058–2083 (Fig. 2). Primer extension analysis demonstrated that G2069 was the residue covalently linked to tRNA. When oligonucleotide pairs 7/8 and 7a/8a were used to direct RNase H cleavage of tRNA-23 S rRNA complexes containing tRNA cross-linked to segment H5, the site of tRNA attachment was found to be delimited by nucleotides 1910–1990 within fragment F5 (Fig. 2). Hybridization to oligonucleotides 19, 20, and 21 revealed that only oligonucleotide 21 protects the 23 S rRNA region tagged by [5′-32P](2N3A76)tRNAPhe from RNase T1 digestion; the site of cross-linking must therefore be located between nucleotides 1922 and 1929 (see Fig. 2). Unequivocal identification of the cross-linked nucleotide within this sequence proved impossible owing to stops in all lanes at C1924 and A1927. We suggest that the stop at A1927 obscures the cross-link of tRNA to U1926, a highly conserved nucleotide that is protected from chemical modification by P site tRNA (2Moazed D. Noller H.F. Nature. 1989; 342: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). When three deacylated (2N3A76)tRNAPhe molecules were bound simultaneously to poly(U)-programmed ribosomes and then subjected to UV irradiation, cross-links were observed in segments H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 (Fig. 1 g). Subsequent analysis revealed that the tRNA mainly labeled nucleotides U2506, U2585, and C2422, with smaller amounts cross-linked to nucleotides U1926 and G2069. Because these five nucleotides are exactly the same as those labeled by (2N3A76)tRNAPhe molecules, or their derivatives, placed individually at either the A, P, or E sites, we found no evidence for additional, nonspecific cross-links when tRNA is present in excess.

To elucidate the underlying mechanism of injury caused by hepatitis delta virus, we examined whether two isoforms of the hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg) had any effect on five well defined intracellular signal transduction pathways: serum response factor (SRF)-, serum response element (SRE)-, nuclear factor κB-, activator protein 1-, and cyclic AMP response element-dependent pathways. Reporter assays revealed that large HDAg (LHDAg) activated the SRF- and SRE-dependent pathways. In contrast, small HDAg (SHDAg) did not activate any of five pathways. LHDAg enhanced the transcriptional ability of SRF without changing its DNA binding affinity in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In addition, LHDAg activated a rat SM22α promoter containing SRF binding site and a human c-fos promoter containing SRE. In conclusion, LHDAg, but not SHDAg, enhances SRF-associated transcriptions. Despite structural similarities between the two HDAgs, there are significant differences in their effects on intracellular signal transduction pathways. These results may provide clues that will aid in the clarification of functional differences between LHDAg and SHDAg and the pathogenesis of delta hepatitis.

Canese M.G. Arico S. Crivelli O. Trepo C. Bonino F. Verme G. Gut. 1977; 18: 997-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). HDAg is the only known protein encoded by the hepatitis delta virus (HDV), which is a defective human pathogen whose transmission requires the helper function of HBV (2Rizzetto M. Hepatology. 1983; 3: 906-912PubMed Google Scholar). The two isoforms of HDAg, large and small forms (3Wang K.-S. Choo Q.-L. Weiner A.-J. Ou J.-H. Najarian R.C. Thayer R.M. Mullenbach G.T.

Nature. 1987; 329: 343-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), are identical except for additional 19 residues located at the C terminus of the large form. The small form of HDAg (SHDAg) consists of 195 amino acids (aa) (molecular masses, 24 kDa), and the large form consists of HDAg (LHDAg) consists of 214 aa (27 kDa) (5Bergmann K.F. Gerin J.L. J. Infect. Dis. 1986; 154: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 6Imazeki F. Omata M. Ohto M. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5594-5599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both forms of HDAgs have common functional domains: an N-terminal coiled-coil domain responsible for oligomerization (7Wang J.-G. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 446-454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a central domain responsible for a nuclear localization signal (8Xia Y.-P. Yeh C.-T. Ou J.-H. Lai M.M.C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 914-921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Chang M.-F. Chang S.C. Chang C.-I. Wu K. Kang H.-Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6019-6027Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a central helix-turn-helix domain responsible for binding to the RNA genome (10Chang M.F. Baker S.C. Soe L.H. Kamahora T. Keck J.G.

Virol. 1990; 64: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these structural similarities, the two HDAgs play complementary roles in HDV replication; SHDAg is required for genome replication (12Kuo M.Y.P. Chao M. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but LHDAg acts as an inhibitor of replication (13Taylor J. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1993; 382: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). LHDAg is also required for HDV assembly (14Chao M. Hsieh S.-Y. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5066-5069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chang F.-L. Chen P.-J. Tu S.-J. Wang C.-J. Chen D.-S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8490-8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar); the formation of HDV viral particles requires isoprenylation at the C terminus of the LHDAg (16Glenn J.S. Watson J.A. Havel C.M. White J.M. Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), although the mechanism of LHDAg on this packaging remains unclarified. It has been shown that SHDAg suppresses the gene expression of HBV (17Wu J.-C. Chen P.-J. Kuo M.-Y. Lee S.-D. Chen D.-S. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, HDV infection often causes severe chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis as a superinfection of chronic HBV carriers and fulminant hepatitis as a coinfection with HBV (18Hoofnagle J.H. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1989; 261: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It was also reported that SHDAg possessed a cytotoxic effect on infected hepatocytes, whereas LHDAg was thought to reduce this effect (19MacNaughton T.B. Gowans E.J. Jilbert A.R. Burrell C.J. Virology. 1990; 177: 692-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The reason why HDV coinfection or superinfection with HBV causes hepatic injury, however, remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated whether the two isoforms of HDAg had any effect on five well defined intracellular signaling pathways: serum response factor (SRF)-, serum response element (SRE)-, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-, activator protein 1 (AP-1)-, and cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-dependent pathways. The HDV sequence used in this study was derived from pSVLD3 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Taylor, Fox Chase Cancer Center, PA), containing a trimer of unit-length HDV cDNA (12Kuo M.Y.P. Chao M. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1945-1950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Bichko V. Barik S. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 512-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both LHDAg and SHDAg regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers having a ScaI restriction site (underlined) (nucleotide positions according to the HPDGEN sequence (21Kuo M.Y.P. Goldberg J. Coates L. Mason W.S. Gerin J. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1988; 63: 1855-1861Crossref Google Scholar) are shown in parentheses): sense primer 5′-AAA AGT ACT ACC ATG AGC CGG TCC GAG TCG AGG A-3′ (1598–1577) and antisense primer 5′-AAA AGT ACT TCA CTG GGG TCG ACA ACT CTG GGG A-3′ () for the LHDAg region and 5′-AAA AGT ACT CTA TGG AAA TCC CTG GTT TCC CCT GA-3′ (1011–1036) for the SHDAg region. Each amplified fragment was digested with ScaI and then cloned into pCXN2 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Miyazaki, University of Osaka, Japan), a mammalian expression plasmid having a β-actin-based CAG promoter (22Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4524) Google Scholar), to generate pCXN2-DLm- and pCXN2-DS-expressing SHDAg. Because pCXN2-DLm contained the nucleotide A at position 1012 according to the sequence of HPDGEN (21Kuo M.Y.P. Goldberg J. Coates L. Mason W.S. Gerin J. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1988; 63: 1855-1861Crossref Google Scholar), we substituted G for A to make a construction of LHDAg-expressing plasmid pCXN2-DL using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), pCXN2-FLAGDL, which expresses FLAG-tagged LHDAg, was constructed by adding the FLAG sequence into the 5′ terminus of the LHDAg region. For evaluation of the transcriptional activation of LHDAg, pM-GAL4DL, which expresses LHDAg protein fused to the yeast GAL4 DNA binding domain (DNA-BD), was constructed by subcloning the LHDAg region into the pM vector, a mammalian expression plasmid encoding the GAL4 DNA-BD gene (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). All cloned plasmids were purified using the Endofree plasmid kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced using an autosequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by the dye termination method, as described previously (23Togo G. Toda N. Kanai F. Kato N. Shiratori Y. Kishi K. Imazeki F. Makuuchi M. Omata M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5620-5623PubMed Google Scholar), to confirm the integration of HDAg genes. Using the T7Elk 1–428 (kindly provided by Dr. R. Treisman, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, UK) (24Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) as a template, the full-length Elk1 region (1–428 aa) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with Elk1 region-specific primers having an XhoI restriction site. Amplified products were digested with XhoI and then cloned into the XhoI site of pCXN2 to generate pCXN2-Elk1. pFA-GALElk (Stratagene) expresses the activation domain of Elk1 (307–427 aa) fused to the GAL4 DNA-BD. A plasmid expressing SRF (10–508 aa) fused to the GAL4 DNA-BD, pSG5-GALSRF (), was a gift from Dr. M. Fujii (Kanazawa University, Japan) (25Fujii M. Chuhjo T. Minamino T. Nomura M. Miyamoto K. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar). Five reporter plasmids containing the Photinus pyralis (firefly) luciferase reporter gene driven by a basic promoter element (TATA box) plus a defined inducible cis-enhancer element were utilized (PathDetect cis-reporting systems, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Each firefly luciferase gene in the reporter plasmid was controlled by the following synthetic enhancer sequences (the binding site for the transcription factor is capitalized): five repeats of the binding sites for SRF (gtCCATATTAGGac, pSRF-Luc), five repeats of SRE (AGGATgtCCATATTAGGacatct, pSRE-Luc), five repeats of the binding sites for NF-κB (tGGGGACTTTCCgc, pNF-κB-Luc), seven repeats of the binding sites for AP-1 (TGACTAA, pAP1-Luc), and four repeats of CRE (agccTGACGTCAgag, pCRE-Luc). A control plasmid expressing Renilla reniformis (sea pansy)-luciferase driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, pRL-TK, was used to correct the efficiency of transfection (Promega, Madison, WI). As a positive control for the activation of SRF-associated pathways, pFC-PKA (Stratagene), which expresses the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A (PKA)) driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, was utilized. In addition to these reporter plasmids that contain synthetic promoters, SM22α-Luc, a luciferase reporter plasmid with a rat smooth muscle-specific gene SM22α promoter (−1507 to +32) containing the binding sites for SRF, generally called the CArG box (kindly provided by Dr. M. E. Lee, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) (26Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S.J. Jain M.K. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and HF456, a luciferase reporter plasmid with a human c-fospromoter (−456 to +47) containing SRE (kindly provided by Dr. T. Ishikawa, University of Tokyo, Japan) (27Ishikawa T. Igarashi T. Hata K. Fujita T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 566-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), were utilized. Specific mutations were introduced into the SM22α-Luc and HF456 plasmids using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The specific base changes were chosen based on their ability to disrupt SRF binding. As for the SM22α-Luc, the CArG box 1 at base pair −162 to −153 was converted from CCAAATATGG to AAAAATATGG (SM22α m1-Luc); the CArG box 2 at base pair −283 to −266 was converted from CCATAAAAGGTTTTTCCC to CCATAAAAAATTTTTCCC (SM22α m2-Luc). Combinations of mutations were generated by performing mutagenesis reactions on a template already containing a mutation (SM22α m1m2-Luc). As for the HF456, the CArG box at base pair -314 to −305 was converted from CCATATTAGG to CCATATTATT(HF456 m1). The sequences and nucleotide positions are according to the previous reports (28Kemp P.R. Osbourn J.K. Grainger D.J. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Altered nucleotides are indicated in bold type. All mutations were verified by sequencing. pFR-Luc (Stratagene) has a firefly-luciferase gene controlled by five yeast GAL4 upstream activation sequences that was utilized as a reporter to examine transcriptional activation of GAL4 DNA-BD-fused Elk1 or SRF by HDAg. HeLa cells (human cervical carcinoma cell line), HuH-7 cells (human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line), and HepG2 cells (hepatoblastoma cell line) were obtained from the Riken cell bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Approximately 4 × 105 HeLa, HuH7, or HepG2 cells were plated into a 6-well tissue culture plate (Iwaki Glass, Chiba, Japan) 24 h before transfection. Using the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), cells were transiently cotransfected with 0.2 μg of reporter plasmids and 0.2 μg of pCXN2, pCXN2-DL, or pCXN2-DS. For evaluation of the transcriptional ability of Elk1 or SRF, cells were transiently cotransfected with 0.15 μg of reporter plasmids, 0.05 μg of pFA-GALElk or pSG5-GALSRF, and 0.2 μg of pCXN2, pCXN2-DL, or pCXN2-DS. For evaluation of the transcriptional ability of LHDAg, 0.2 μg of reporter plasmids and 0.2 μg of pM vector or pM-GAL4DL were used. For the assay using HF456 containing the c-fos promoter, HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS to give low background. Forty-eight hours after transfection, whole cell lysates were examined for luciferase activity (PicaGene dual sea pansy system, Toyo ink, Tokyo, Japan) with a luminometer (Lumat LB9507, EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency based on sea pansy luciferase activity. The luciferase activity of the cells that were transfected with the reporter plasmid plus pCXN2 was set arbitrarily at 1.0, and then the relative luciferase activity was compared with this established value. Assays were performed at least in triplicate. As only a small percentage of the cells were transfected by a transient transfection method, we utilized the MACSelect system (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) to concentrate transiently plasmid-transfected cells. The concentration of the plasmid-transfected cells was achieved by magnetically isolating the transfected cells via a surface marker, a truncated mouse H-2Kk molecule, which was expressed from the cotransfected plasmid, pMacsKk. HeLa cells were cotransfected with pCXN2, pCXN2-FLAGDL, or pFC-PKA together with pMacsKk. After 36 h, cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin and dispersed by being transferred by pipet into single-cell suspensions after the addition of 100 μl of FBS. The cells were resuspended with 600 μl of PBE buffer (phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 2 mm EDTA) containing 80 μl of micromagnetic beads conjugated with a monoclonal antibody against mouse H-2Kk and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then magnetically labeled cells were recovered by the magnetic separation column and used for an EMSA. Annealed oligonucleotides for the CArG box (5′-GGATGTCCATATTAGGACATC-3′) were end-labeled with [α-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extracts were obtained from HeLa cells transfected with pCXN2, pCXN2-DL, or pFC-PKA as described previously (30Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3903) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of nuclear extracts was measured by a micro-BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) and was then adjusted to give equal concentration. Four micrograms of the nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.035 pmol of the CArG box radiolabeled probe. Anti-SRF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used for the supershift assay. The CArG box-unlabeled competitor was added at a 100-fold molar excess to confirm site-specific binding. The binding reaction was performed at room temperature for 30 min in a 10-μl mixture consisting of 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·(dI-dC). DNA-protein complexes were then loaded onto a chilled 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. Gel electrophoresis was executed in 0.25 × Tris borate-EDTA at 4 °C. The gel was dried, and autoradiography was performed using a Fujix bio-imaging analyzer BAS 2000 (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan). LHDAg and SHDAg expression was confirmed by Western blotting (ECL-plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the soluble protein extracts of HeLa cells that were transfected with pCXN2, pCXN2-DL, or pCXN2-DS (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.1-18.88Google Scholar). HDAg expression was examined using serum obtained from a patient with chronic HDV infection. Using the soluble protein extracts of HeLa cells transfected with pCXN2-Elk1 and pCXN2-DL cultured in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS, the phosphorylation of Elk1 was examined by anti-Elk1 antibody and anti-phospho-specific Elk1 (Ser-383) antibody (PhosphoPlus Elk1 (Ser-383) antibody kit, New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistical analysis was performed using the t test. Ap value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Each of the five reporter plasmids (pSRF-Luc, pSRE-Luc, pNF-κB-Luc, pAP1-Luc, or pCRE-Luc) was transiently cotransfected into HeLa cells with pCXN2, pCXN2-DL, or pCXN2-DS. LHDAg activated the SRF- and SRE-dependent signal transduction pathway at a value 4.0 ± 1.2 (mean ± S.D.)-fold and 2.5 ± 1.0-fold higher than the control, respectively (Fig. 1 A). There was no significantly increased activation in the remaining three pathways by LHDAg. In addition, SHDAg did not activate any of the five pathways (Fig. 1 A). Expression of LHDAg and SHDAg were confirmed by Western blotting at the expected size: LHDAg at a molecular mass of 27 kDa and SHDAg at a molecular mass of 24 kDa (5Bergmann K.F. Gerin J.L. J. Infect. Dis. 1986; 154: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). We investigated whether LHDAg activated the SRF-dependent pathway in other cell lines. Results similar to those in HeLa cells were obtained in HuH-7 cells (4.3 ± 2.4-fold higher than control) and HepG2 cells (3.3 ± 1.0-fold) (Fig. 1 B). In addition, LHDAg activated the SRF-dependent signal in a dose-dependent manner in HeLa cells (Fig.1 C). Since LHDAg and SHDAg play complementary roles in genome viral replication, we examined whether SHDAg had influence on SRF-dependent transcription by LHDAg. Although HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pSRF-Luc and pCXN2-DL in combination with various amounts of pCXN2-DS, the presence of SHDAg had no influence on activation of the SRF-dependent pathway by LHDAg (Fig.2). Because LHDAg is a nuclear protein, we examined whether LHDAg itself possessed transactivation activity. pM-GAL4DL, a GAL4 DNA-BD-LHDAg fusion protein-expression plasmid, was cotransfected into HeLa cells with pFR-Luc. The GAL4 DNA-BD-LHDAg fusion protein, however, did not activate transcription from pFR-Luc (1.0 ± 0.1-fold higher than control), suggesting that LHDAg itself had no transcriptional ability in mammalian cells. To elucidate how LHDAg activates the SRF-dependent signal transduction pathway, we examined the influence of LHDAg on 1) transcriptional ability of SRF by a reporter assay, 2) SRF binding to SRF binding site, the CArG box (CC(A/T)6GG), by EMSA, and 3) a rat SM22α promoter containing two CArG boxes. We initially examined whether LHDAg enhanced the transcriptional activation of SRF. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pFR-Luc, pSG5-GALSRF (), and pCXN2-DL. The cells were then assayed for the luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the transcriptional ability of SRF increased by approximately 2.5-fold with LHDAg. Next we examined whether LHDAg modified SRF binding to the CArG box by EMSA using nuclear extracts of HeLa cells transfected with pCXN2, pCXN2-FLAGDL, or pFC-PKA and concentrated by MACSelect system. After concentration by the MACSelect system, we could confirm that more than 70% of collected cells were transfection-positive by immunostaining with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) (data not shown). LHDAg did not influence SRF binding to the CArG box; however, binding increased by the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig.3 B). Moreover, LHDAg was not contained in the DNA-protein complex because mobility of DNA-SRF complex did not change in the presence of FLAG-tagged LHDAg, and no supershifted band was observed by adding anti-FLAG M2 antibody (data not shown). We examined whether LHDAg activated a rat promoter containing the CArG box. By use of SM22α-Luc, the reporter plasmid with a SM22α promoter containing two CArG boxes, luciferase activity increased by a value 3.3 ± 0.5-fold higher than the control with LHDAg (Fig.4 B), whereas there was no increase with SHDAg (data not shown). To determine whether this activation by LHDAg was mediated by the CArG box, we mutated two CArG boxes, either alone or combinations, and then measured luciferase activity with LHDAg or without LHDAg. Mutations of each CArG box, which abolish SRF binding, were introduced into the indicated elements in the context of the wild type reporter construct (Fig. 4 A), and their influence was examined in transient transfection assays. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the effect of LHDAg on the SM22α promoter were decreased when the CArG boxes were mutated, indicating that activation of the SM22α promoter by LHDAg is dependent on enhancement of the transcriptional ability of SRF. LHDAg activated not only the SRF-dependent pathway but also the SRE-dependent pathway. SRE is composed of the CArG box bound SRF and nearby Ets motif bound ternary complex factors such as Elk1. Elk1, regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (32Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 33Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 34Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), is phosphorylated by mitogen-activated protein kinase at a cluster of serine/threonine motifs located at its C terminus. Phosphorylation at these sites, particularly Ser-383, is critical for transcriptional activation (24Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 35Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the influence of LHDAg on 1) transcriptional activation of Elk1 protein by a reporter assay, 2) phosphorylation of Elk1 protein by Western blotting, and 3) the human c-fos promoter containing SRE. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with pFR-Luc, pFA-GALElk, and pCXN2-DL. Cells were then assayed for luciferase activity. The transcriptional ability of ELK1 was not increased by LHDAg (Fig. 3 C). Western blotting analysis of Elk1 also indicated that LHDAg did not enhance the phosphorylation of Elk1 (Fig.3 C), thereby suggesting that LHDAg has no effect on the transcriptional ability of Elk1. By use of HF456, a reporter plasmid with a c-fos promoter containing SRE, the luciferase activity increased by a value 1.8 ± 0.3-fold higher than the control with LHDAg (Fig. 4 C), although it did not increase with SHDAg (data not shown). To determine whether this activation by LHDAg was mediated by the CArG box, we mutated the CArG box and then measured luciferase activity with LHDAg or without LHDAg. Mutation of the CArG box was introduced into the indicated element in the context of the wild type reporter construct (Fig. 4 A), and the influence was examined. As shown in Fig. 4 C, the effect of LHDAg on the c-fos promoter was decreased when the CArG box was mutated. Since LHDAg had no effect on Elk1, this activation of the c-fos promoter occurred through the transcriptional activation of SRF by LHDAg. These results suggest that activation of the SRE-dependent signal by LHDAg is dependent on enhancement of the transcriptional ability of SRF, not Elk1. In this study, LHDAg clearly activated SRF-associated pathways by enhancing the transcriptional ability of SRF without changing its DNA binding affinity. We confirmed this LHDAg-induced activation not only by using plasmids with synthetic enhancers but also by using plasmids with the rat SM22α promoter and the human c-fos promoter as well as a plasmid with the yeast GAL4 upstream activation sequence. SRF was identified as a critical factor involved in mediating serum and growth factor-induced transcription from the c-fosproto-oncogene (36Treisman R. Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The SRF binding site in the promoters of immediate-early genes c-fos and pip92 (37Latinkic B.V. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23163-23170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is called SRE, which is composed of two elements, the CArG box (CCATATTAGG) and the nearby Ets motif (AGGAT). SRF binds to the CArG box as a dimer, whereas Elk1 cannot do so by itself, but it binds to the Ets motif by making a ternary complex with SRF (34Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 36Treisman R. Ammerer G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Although the activation of c-fos SRE through the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade is mainly dependent on Elk1 (32Hill C.S. Marais R. John S. Wynne J. Dalton S. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 33Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E.

Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), SRF can solely activate c-fos SRE in response to serum growth factors and intracellular activation of heterotrimeric G protein (29Hill C.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Several viral-transforming proteins such as human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) activator protein Tax, the polyomavirus middle-T antigen, and HBV X protein (HBx) target c-Fos induction (25Fujii M. Chuhjo T. Minamino T. Nomura M. Miyamoto K. Seiki M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 7-14PubMed Google Scholar, 38Fujii M. Tsuchiya H. Chuhjo T. Akizawa T. Seiki M.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1567-1574PubMed Google Scholar). Tax and the polyomavirus middle-T antigen enhance c-Fos induction through SRF (38Fujii M. Tsuchiya H. Chuhjo T. Akizawa T. Seiki M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 39Urich M. Senften M. Shaw P.E. Ballmer-Hofer K. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Tax directly binds to SRF to activate transcription. On the other hand, middle-T antigen activates transcription via Rac activation in the cytoplasm, but the pathway from Rac to SRF is unknown. Although LHDAg is a nuclear protein, we could not observe an interaction between LHDAg and SRF by immunoprecipitation (data not shown). It has been shown that stimulation by growth hormone, angiotensin II, and HMG-I induce the transcriptional activation of SRF by enhancing binding activity of SRF to the CArG box (26Chin M.T. Pellacani A. Wang H. Lin S.S.J. Jain M.K. Perrella M.A. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9755-9760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 41Liao J. Hodge C. Meyer D.

Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 600-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). LHDAg, however, did not increase SRF binding to the CArG box, whereas PKA enhanced the binding (Fig. 3 B). Although the mechanism underlying activation of the SRF-dependent signaling pathway has not been completely elucidated, there is mention that PKA is required for SRF nuclear import (43Gauthier-Rouviere C. Vandromme M. Lautredou N. Cai Q.Q. Girard F. Fernandez A. Lamb N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PKA has also been shown to activate the CRE-dependent pathway. Therefore, this evidence together with a lack of activation of the CRE-dependent pathway by LHDAg (Fig. 1 A) leads to the conclusion that SRF activation by LHDAg seems to be PKA-independent. These results suggest that LHDAg activates SRF-associated transcription through a novel mechanism. In the case of HBx, results similar to those of LHDAg have been noted (44Lin Y. Tang H. Nomura T. Dorjsuren D. Hayashi N. Wei W. Ohta T. Roeder R. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27097-27103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although HBx cannot bind double strand DNA directly and does not act as a transcriptional activator (45Yen B.T.S. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 3: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), it can transactivate many cellular genes. HBx activates transcription through its interaction with a variety of transactivators (46Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 47Lin Y. Nomura T. Yamashita T. Dorjsuren D. Tang H. Murakami S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5137-5142PubMed Google Scholar) and transcription factors such as TFIIB, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase subunit 5 (48Haviv I. Vaizel D. Shaul Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3413-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 49Cheong J.H. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Therefore, a possible mechanism underlying the enhancement of transcriptional activation of SRF by LHDAg could be that LHDAg functions as a co-transactivator. Since HDAgs have no RNA polymerase activity, HDV requires host cellular proteins such as RNA polymerase II for replication of its genome (50MacNaughton T.B. Gowans E.J. McNamara S.P. Burrell C.J. Virology. 1991; 184: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 51Fu T.-B. Taylor J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6965-6972Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since both HDAgs are known to participate in HDV replication, it is not difficult to speculate that HDAgs may recruit a transcription factor or RNA polymerase II-related proteins for its viral replication. In fact, HDAg interacts with nuclear proteins such as delta interacting protein A, nucleolin, and karyopherin α2 (52Brazas R. Ganem D. Science. 1996; 274: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 53Lee C.-H. Chang S.C. Chen C.-J. Chang M.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7650-7656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 54Chou H.C. Hsieh T.Y. Sheu G.T. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 3684-3689Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overexpression of nucleolin (nucleolin-expressing plasmid pCGN-Nu was kindly provided by Dr. S. C. Lee, National Taiwan University, Taiwan (55Yang T., H. Tsai W., H. Lee Y., M. Lei H., Y. Lai M., Y. Chen D., S. Yeh N., H. Lee S., C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6068-6074Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)) activated the SRF-dependent pathway at a value two times higher than that with LHDAg alone (data not shown). Although there is no evidence that delta interacting protein A or karyopherin α2 mediates transcription, nucleolin has been implicated in rDNA transcription, rRNA maturation, ribosome assembly, and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport (56Ginisty H. Sicard H. Roger B. Bouvet P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 761-772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that nucleolin plays an important role in the enhancement of transcriptional activation of SRF by LHDAg. Recently Wei and Ganem (57Wei Y. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that LHDAg, but not SHDAg, could activate transcription from several promoters, including the AP-1 binding site. Their findings are consistent with our results that only LHDAg can activate transcription, although Wei and Ganem did not investigate the mechanism of how LHDAg activates the pathway. Although transfection of 0.2 μg of pCXN2-DL did not activate the AP-1-dependent pathway, transfection of 0.4 μg of pCXN2-DL activated the pathway by approximately 2.5-fold higher than control (data not shown). Thus, LHDAg may be a potent activator of the AP-1-dependent pathway when expressed in a relatively large amount. On the other hand, Lo et al. (58Lo K. Sheu G.-T. Lai M.M.C. Virology. 1998; 247: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both LHDAg and SHDAg inhibited SP1-activated and basal RNA polymerase II transcription. Although we did not examine the effect of HDAgs on SP-1-associated or basal RNA polymerase II transcription, it may be possible that LHDAg inhibits this transcription by withholding the key transcriptional factors necessary for the activation of SRF-dependent pathways. LHDAg activated a rat SM22α promoter having a CArG box. The CArG box has been identified as a constituent in the promoters of a number of muscle-specific genes, including SM22α (28Kemp P.R. Osbourn J.K. Grainger D.J. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1037-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (59Min B.H. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16667-16675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cardiac and skeletal muscle actin (60Muscat G.E. Gustafson T.A. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4120-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 61Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2191-2201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). LHDAg may enhance the transcription of these muscle-specific genes containing a CArG box. For example, α-SMA is expressed by activated hepatic stellate cells, a kind of hepatic sinusoidal cell that causes hepatic fibrosis (62Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Therefore, there may be a possibility that LHDAg up-regulates transcription of α-SMA through SRF, causes activation of hepatic stellate cells, and induces hepatic fibrosis. LHDAg also activated the c-fos promoter through SRF. A number of experiments have suggested that c-Fos plays a critical role in the response to growth factors and that aberrant production of c-Fos protein can lead to oncogenesis. Interestingly, hepatitis delta patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma were younger than patients infected by HBV alone (63Oliveri F. Brunetto M.R. Baldi M. Piantino P. Ponzetto A. Forzani B. Smedile A. Verme G. Bonino F. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1991; 364: 217-222PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that LHDAg may promote cell proliferation through the induction of c-Fos protein. In summary, LHDAg, but not SHDAg, activates SRF-associated pathways. This observation may provide clues to help clarify the functional differences between LHDAg and SHDAg and the pathogenesis of delta hepatitis. We thank Drs. J. Taylor, J. Miyazaki, R. Treisman, M. E.

It has been shown that the ectopic expression of EPOR confers EPO-dependent proliferation on an interleukin 3 (IL3)-dependent cell line, Ba/F3, whereas the IL2-dependent T cell line, CTLL-2 expressing the EPOR (T-ER), fails to proliferate in response to EPO. However, the molecular basis of the EPO unresponsiveness in CTLL-2 has not been clarified. We found that the expression level of JAK2 in T-ER cells was much lower than that in Ba/F3 cells. Therefore, we examined the effects of forced expression of JAK2 in T-ER cells. In T-ER transformants expressing JAK2 (T-JER), EPO induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EPOR, JAK2, and STAT5, and consequently STAT5-responsive genes including bcl-X and cis1were normally induced. Furthermore, T-JER cells were resistant to apoptosis until at least 72 h after switching from IL2 to EPO. Although T-JER cells could not continuously proliferate in the presence of EPO, additional expression of JAK2 in T-JER (T-JJER) to a level similar to that in Ba/F3 cells supported long term proliferation in response to EPO. JAK2 was equally co-immunoprecipitated with the EPOR among T-JER, T-JJER, and Ba/F3 cells expressing the EPOR (BF-ER). However, EPO-dependent mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation was observed in T-JJER and BF-ER cells but not in T-JER cells. EPO-dependent long term proliferation of T-JER cells was conferred by expression of the constitutively activated form of MEK1. Our results suggest that MAP kinase activation is, at least in part, an important component for mitotic signal from the EPOR, and CTLL-2 cells probably lack signaling molecule(s) in JAK2 and the Ras-MAP kinase pathway.

The IL3-dependent cell line Ba/F3 has been widely used to investigate proliferation signals from the cytokine receptors, including EPOR (16Yoshimura A. D'Andrea A.D. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In contrast, IL2-dependent T cell lines CTLL-2 provided controversial results concerning proliferation in response to EPO (25Showers M.O. Moreau J.F. Linnekin D. Druker B. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 3070-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Barber D.L. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6506-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Yamamura Y. Kageyama Y.

A. 1994; 91: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). One report indicated that EPOR expression conferred EPO-dependent growth on a CTLL-2 line, whereas others did not. A previous study indicated that EPO did not induce phosphorylation of the EPOR, although infection with Kirsten murine sarcoma virus (v-Ki-Ras) conferred EPO responsiveness on a CTLL-2 subline (28Yamamura Y. Noda M. Ikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The same group also reported that the expression of v-Ki-Ras resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of tyrosine phosphorylated 160-kDa and 130-kDa proteins with the EPOR, although JAK2 was not present in this immune complex. In another study, interaction between JAK2 and EPOR was not detected in EPO-unresponsive CTLL-2 cells expressing the EPOR (5Wakao H. Harada N. Kitamura T. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Recently, Gaffen et al. (29Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Longmore G.D. Liu K.D. Goldsmith M.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 74-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also found that another IL2-dependent T cell line, HT-2, failed to respond to EPO when the EPOR was expressed. In this case, EPO induced phosphorylation of JAK2 and the EPOR but not STAT5. Complementation experiments using a fusion between HT-2 and Ba/F3 cells indicted that factor(s) essential for signaling from the EPOR are missing in HT-2 cells. In the present study, we obtained two CTLL-2 cell lines, one that was able to proliferate in response to EPO after ectopic expression of the EPOR, whereas the other was not, and analyzed signaling pathways from the EPOR. We concluded that the low level of JAK2 as well as the lack of a link between JAK2 and MAP kinase pathway are the primary reasons for the EPO unresponsiveness of CTLL-2 cells. We obtained two mouse IL2-dependent cytotoxic T cell lines derived from CTLL-2; one was provided by Dr. Sugamura (Tohoku University) and abbreviated as T-CTLL-2, whereas the other, abbreviated D-CTLL-2, was from Dr. Mui, DNAX Research Institute. Both cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10% conditioned medium from P3UI (BCMGS-mIL2) cells as a source of IL2. 10% conditioned medium corresponded to approximately 100 units/ml IL2. Expression of the EPOR conferred EPO-dependent long term proliferation on D-CTLL-2 cells, whereas T-CTLL-2 expressing the EPOR did not proliferate in response to EPO. Mouse IL3-dependent Ba/F3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum, and 10% WEHI conditioned medium as a source of IL3. Recombinant human EPO was kindly provided by Kirin Brewery Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Anti-JAK2 antibodies were purchased from UBI (062-255) or raised by immunizing a rabbit with purified recombinant JH1 domain of JAK2 fused to glutathioneS-transferase. Anti-STAT5 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-17), and anti-phosphorylated STAT5-specific antibody was from UBI (06-798). Anti-ERK2 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (C-14), and anti-active ERK1/2 antibody was from Promega (803A). Anti-EPOR antibody was described previously (17Yoshimura A. Zimmers T. Neumann D. Longmore G. Yoshimura Y. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11619-11625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse EPOR in pEF-neo and mouse JAK2 in pEF-BOS were transfected into cells by electroporation as described (30Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Tanimura S. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Ohtsubo M. Ohtsuka A. Fujita T. Ohta T. Furukawa Y. Iwase S. Yamada H. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1998; 92: 1668-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). JAK2 cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pME-hygro (JAK2/pmE-hygro) containing the hygromycin resistance marker. Ba/F3, D-CTLL-2, and T-CTLL-2 transfectants expressing EPOR were designated as BF-ER, D-ER, and T-ER, respectively. T-CTLL-2 transformant expressing both EPOR and JAK2 was designated as T-JER. T-JER further transformed with JAK2/pmE-hygro was designated as T-JJER. Cell proliferation was measured by a colorimetric assay using 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-dissulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (WST-1; Dojindo, Japan). Exponentially growing cells (2 × 104) were plated on microtiter plates in 100 μl of culture medium in the presence of various concentrations of EPO. After incubation at 37 °C for 4 days, 10 μl of 3.2 mg/ml WST-1 was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 1 h. Optical densities were measured using a microplate reader with a test wavelength of 405 nm and a reference wavelength of 620 nm. After stimulation with 10 units/ml EPO or 10 ng/ml IL2, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 μm sodium vanadate, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min. To detect binding between JAK2 and the EPOR, digitonin was used instead of Triton X-100 as a detergent (4Miura O. Nakamura N. Quelle F.W. Witthuhn B.A. Ihle J.N. Aoki N. Blood. 1994; 84: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supernatants were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the EPOR or JAK2 and then incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μm vanadate. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking in TBST (20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% dry fat skim milk, the membrane was probed with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The membrane was washed with TBST three times and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h. After washing with TBST three times, blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Total RNA was separated on 1.0% agarose gels containing 2.4% formaldehyde and then transferred onto positively charged nylon membranes (Hybond N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After fixation under calibrated UV irradiation, the membranes were hybridized with digitonin-labeled riboprobes prepared using a digitonin-RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The blots were stained using alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digitonin antibody and chemiluminescent substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. To make digitonin-riboprobe for JAK2, the JAK2 cDNA was digested with EcoRI, and then the EcoRI fragment () was subcloned into BKS(−). Probes forbcl-X, cis1, and c-myc were described previously (31Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Aliquots of exponentially growing cells (1 × 106) were cultured in the presence or absence of EPO or IL2 for the indicated periods. Then the cell cycle was analyzed with a fluorescence activating cell sorter (FACS) after staining with propidium iodine (PI) as described previously (32Vindelov L.L. Christensen Y.J. Nissen N.Y. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar). There have been conflicting reports concerning EPO responsiveness of CTLL-2 cells expressing the EPOR. One report indicated that EPOR expression conferred EPO-dependent growth on CTLL-2 cells, whereas others did not (25Showers M.O. Moreau J.F. Linnekin D. Druker B. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 3070-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Barber D.L. D'Andrea A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6506-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 27Yamamura Y. Kageyama Y.

A. 1994; 91: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To clarify the reason for this discrepancy and the molecular mechanism of the EPO unresponsiveness in CTLL-2 cells, we obtained two CTLL-2 sublines (T-CTLL-2 and D-CTLL-2) from different institutes and introduced EPOR cDNA into both cell lines. D-CTLL-2 cells expressing EPOR (D-ER) were able to proliferate in EPO as fast as IL3-dependent Ba/F3 cells expressing the EPOR (BF-ER). However, T-CTLL-2 cell line expressing EPOR (T-ER) did not proliferate in response to EPO. EPO did not inhibit apoptosis of T-ER cells after switching from IL2 (Fig. 2 A, T-ER). First we compared JAK2 expression levels among these cell lines. Northern as well as Western blotting experiments indicated that both JAK2 mRNA and protein levels in D-CTLL-2 and D-ER cells were close to those in Ba/F3 and BF-ER cells, whereas T-CTLL-2 and T-ER cells expressed much lower levels of JAK2 (Fig. 1). These results suggested that one simple explanation for the EPO unresponsiveness in T-ER cells is the low level of expression of JAK2.Figure 1The expression of endogenous JAK2 in parental and EPOR-expressed cells. A, Northern blot of endogenous JAK2 mRNA. Total RNA from the indicated cells (5 μg/lane) was hybridized with JAK2 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes. B, Western blot of endogenous JAK2. Total cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-JAK2-JH1 antibody. Membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-STAT5 antibody as internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the possibility that low JAK2 level caused EPO unresponsiveness in T-ER cells, we introduced JAK2 and the EPOR simultaneously into T-CTLL-2 cells. The resulting cells (T-JER) were resistant to apoptosis up to at least 72 h after switching from IL2 to EPO, whereas EPO failed to prevent cell death in both T-ER cells and in T-CTLL2 cells (Fig. 2 A). However T-JER cells did not continuously proliferate in EPO (see Fig.3 A). To compare signals between the EPO and IL2-receptors, we examined gene expression. As shown in Fig. 2 B, EPO as well as IL2 induced c-myc, bcl-X, and cis1 in T-JER cells, although EPO-induced c-myc and bcl-X levels were slightly lower than those induced by IL2. Induction of bcl-Xmay explain the anti-apoptotic activity of EPO in T-JER cells (Fig.2 B). Because cis1 and bcl-X have been shown to be induced by STAT5, these observations suggested that STAT5 was normally activated by EPO in T-JER cells. Indeed, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 was normally induced in response to EPO in T-JER cells (see Fig. 4 A). We also compared gene expression between T-JER and BF-ER cells (Fig.2 C). Although cis1 was induced in T-JER cells at a level similar to that in BF-ER cells, the levels of c-mycand bcl-X in T-JER cells were lower than those in BF-ER cells, suggesting that full induction of these genes may be necessary for long term proliferation.Figure 4EPO-induced STAT5 and ERK activation in CTLL-2 or Ba/F3 transformants. T-JER, T-JJER, and BF-ER cells were treated with EPO (10 units/ml) or IL2 (100 units/ml) or 1% WEHI conditioned medium (IL3) for the indicated periods (min). The cell lysates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblotted with anti-tyrosine phosphorylated STAT5 (A, α-PY-STAT5) or anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 (B, α-P-ERK1/2) antibodies. Subsequently, the membranes were reprobed with anti-STAT5 (A, α-STAT5) or anti-ERK2 (B, α-ERK2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We found that the JAK2 expression level in T-JER cells was still slightly lower than that in BF-ER cells (Fig. 3 A). Thus, we additionally introduced JAK2 into T-JER cells using the hygromycin resistance marker for selection. Two clones (T-JJER) were obtained, and they expressed similar levels of JAK2 to BF-ER cells (Fig. 3 A). These cells were able to proliferate in response to EPO in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). Thus, we further compared EPOR signal transduction pathways between T-JER, T-JJER, and Ba/F3 cells. First, we compared the kinetics of tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 among T-JER, T-JJER, and BF-ER cells. As shown in Fig. 3 C, EPO-induced JAK2 phosphorylation was detected in all three cell lines, although it was much weaker in T-JER cells compared with T-JJER and BF-ER cells. Previously Wakao et al. (5Wakao H. Harada N. Kitamura T. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) reported that CTLL-2 expressing EPOR did not proliferate in response to EPO because JAK2 did not associate with the EPOR. To examine this possibility, the EPOR was immunoprecipitated and the immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-JAK2 (Fig. 3 D). The amount of JAK2 associated with the EPOR was similar among the three cell lines. The mechanism of lower level activation of JAK2 in T-JER cells is not clear at present. However, these data suggest that EPO induced activation of JAK2 in T-JER cells, but this level of JAK2 activation was not sufficient for long term proliferation. To understand the missing pathway in T-JER cells, we analyzed STAT5 and MAP kinase (Erk) activation. STAT5 and the Ras-MAP kinase pathway have been shown to be commonly activated by EPO, IL2, and IL3. As shown in Fig.4 A, STAT5 was similarly phosphorylated in T-JER, T-JJER, and BF-ER cells in response to IL2, IL3, or EPO, although EPO-induced STAT5 phosphorylation was substantially weaker in T-JER cells compared with T-JJER and BF-ER cells. However, EPO induced cis1, a direct target of STAT5 in T-JER at a level comparable to that in BF-ER cells (see Fig. 3 B). Thus, STAT5 was sufficiently activated to induce target genes in T-JER cells in response to EPO. Next, we compared the activation of MAP kinase using anti-active MAPK (ERK1/2) specific antibody (Fig. 4 B). No differences in ERK1/2 activation between T-JER and T-JJER in response to IL2 were detected, whereas a robust ERK1/2 activation was detected when T-JJER were induced with EPO. To determine the role of MAP kinase activation in proliferation of CTLL-2 cells, we established T-JER transformants (T-JERMEK) expressing active MEK1 cDNA. T-JERMEK cells exhibited constitutive ERK1/2 activation as expected (data not shown). By expressing active MEK1, T-JER cells acquired the ability to proliferate continuously in response to EPO (Fig. 5). Moreover, we found that some T-JERMEK clones could survive without cytokines for 4 days. These observations indicated that MAPK activation was one of the essential growth signals induced by the EPOR, and efficient activation of this pathway may not occur in T-CTLL and T-JER cells. Although growth of hematopoietic cells is controlled by a variety of cytokines, the precise mechanisms of signal transduction from cytokine receptors for growth and anti-apoptotic effects have not been elucidated. Ectopic expression of EPOR has been shown to confer EPO-dependent proliferation on Ba/F3 cells but not on certain CTLL-2 sublines. This system could provide important insights into the signaling pathways from the EPOR that are essential for proliferation. In vertebrates, four members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinase have been identified, and each member has been shown to play a central role in the function of the cytokine receptors. Fetal liver cells from JAK2-deficient mice failed to respond to EPO but were rescued by infection with a retrovirus carrying JAK2 cDNA (33Neubauer H. Cumano A. Muller M. Wu H. Huffstadt U. Pfeffer K. Cell. 1998; 93: 397-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 34Parganas E. Wang D. Stravopodis D. Topham D.J. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Vanin E.F. Bodner S. Colamonici O.R. van Deursen J.M. Grosveld G. Ihle J.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 385-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (912) Google Scholar). These results demonstrated that JAK2 is essential for EPOR function. Previous studies concluded that there were no differences in the expression level of JAK2 protein between two CTLL-2 cell lines (5Wakao H. Harada N. Kitamura T. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, their CTLL-2 cells (D-CTLL) frequently responded to EPO after transfection of the EPOR. In contrast, we never obtained EPO-responsive clones from the CTLL-2 subline T-CTLL obtained from Tohoku University. T-CTLL cells expressed much lower levels of JAK2 than D-CTLL cells. We obtained T-CTLL transformants with different levels of JAK2 (T-JER and T-JJER). Since elevated expression of JAK2 in T-CTLL cells expressing the EPOR (T-JJER) conferred EPO-dependent long term proliferation, we conclude that one of the primary reasons for the EPO unresponsiveness of T-CTLL cells was a low level of JAK2 expression. Wakao et al. (5Wakao H. Harada N. Kitamura T. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins was not induced in an EPO-unresponsive CTLL-2 subline expressing the EPOR, and they found that JAK2 was not associated with the EPOR in ERT cells (5Wakao H. Harada N. Kitamura T. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Similarly, Yamamura et al. (28Yamamura Y. Noda M. Ikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that JAK2 was not present in the EPOR complex from a CTLL-2 subline (C/ERas4), which expressed both v-Ki-Ras and EPOR (28Yamamura Y. Noda M. Ikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Our results shown in Fig. 3 were not consistent with theirs. We demonstrated that EPO unresponsiveness in CTLL-2 expressing the EPOR cannot be explained by uncoupling between JAK2 and the EPOR. This discrepancy might have been due to differences in conditions used for solubilization of the EPOR complex or due to differences in the CTLL-2 cell lines. We demonstrated that the amount of JAK2 in T-JER cells was not sufficient for long term proliferation following EPO stimulation. JAK2 level in T-JER cells may not reach a critical threshold concentration that is sufficient to produce long term proliferation signals because T-JJER cells that express higher levels of JAK2 grew continuously in EPO. Recently, it has been demonstrated that cytokines exert both anti-apoptotic and cell cycle-driving signals. Gaffen et al.(29Gaffen S.L. Lai S.Y. Longmore G.D. Liu K.D. Goldsmith M.A. Blood. 1999; 94: 74-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the EPOR transmitted anti-apoptotic signals but not proliferation signals in IL2-dependent HT cells. They could not detect the activation of STAT5 despite phosphorylation of the EPOR and JAK2, and they suggested that the anti-apoptotic signal of the EPOR in HT-2 cells is different from Bcl-2, Bcl-X, and MAP kinase activation. We also observed that EPO could exert anti-apoptotic effects in T-JER cells, probably through the activation of STAT5. Consistent with this hypothesis, bcl-X mRNA was induced in T-JER stimulated with EPO (Fig. 3 B). It is generally accepted that Bcl-X2 is a critical factor for survival of erythroid progenitor cells as well as many cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cell lines (35Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Satoshi F. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). It has been shown that STAT5, at least in part, plays an important role in Bcl-X2 induction (6Socolovsky M. Fallon A.E. Wang S. Brugnara C. Lodish H.F.

Our results supported this hypothesis, although the anti-apoptotic effect in T-JER cells might depend on a pathway distinct from that in HT-2 cells. Further studies are necessary to clarify the differences between T-JER and HT cells. EPO activated MAP kinase in T-JJER but not in T-JER cells, suggesting that MAP kinase activation is an important component of the proliferation signal from the EPOR. Although it has been controversial whether MAP kinase cascades are necessary for proliferation by IL3 and EPO (8, 9 38–40), Kinoshita et al. (41Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) reported that Ras is necessary for the anti-apoptotic effect in Ba/F3 cells (41Kinoshita T. Shirouzu M. Kamiya A. Hashimoto K. Yokoyama S. Miyajima A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The Ras-MAP kinase pathway has been shown to be necessary for cell cycle progression through the IL6/gp130 system (42Fukada T. Hibi M. Yamanaka Y. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Fujitani Y. Yamaguchi T. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Immunity. 1996; 5: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We also observed that T-JERMEK cells, T-JER transformants expressing active-MEK1, conferred MAP kinase phosphorylation and proliferation in response to EPO. Moreover, MAP kinase phosphorylation was observed in all CTLL-2 transformants in response to IL2. Thus, MAP kinase can be activated efficiently through the IL2 receptor/JAK1, JAK3 system but not through the EPOR/JAK2 system in T-CTLL cells. These observations raise the question of what are the factors lacking between JAK2 and Ras-MAP kinase in T-CTLL-2. Such factors presumably exist in Ba/F3 cells. Yamamura et al. (28Yamamura Y. Noda M. Ikawa Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8866-8870Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that infection of CTLL-2 cells with v-Ki-Ras resulted in proliferation in response to EPO. Several molecules are known to be involved in Ras-MAP kinase activation from cytokine receptors. For example, Shc, Grb2, SHP-2, Gab1, and Gab2 have been shown to be critical signal adaptors between tyrosine kinases and the Ras-MAPK pathway (43Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K.

Gisselbrecht S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among these, we found that Gab2 was present in Ba/F3 cells but not in CTLL-2 cells (data not shown). Gab2 has been shown to be engaged in EPO signaling and participate in the mitotic responses through the MAP kinase cascade (46Lecoq-Lafon C. Verdier F. Fichelson S. Chretien S. Gisselbrecht S. Lacombe C. Mayeux P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2578-2585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, ectopic expression of Gab2 in T-JER did not allow long term proliferation in response to EPO (data not shown). It has also been shown that Lyn tyrosine kinase associates with the EPOR and has been implicated in signaling from the EPOR (47Chin H. Arai A. Wakao H. Kamiyama R. Miyasaka N. Miura O. Blood. 1998; 91: 3734-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Tilbrook P.A. Ingley E. Williams J.H. Hibbs M.L. Klinken S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Lyn is abundant in Ba/F3 cells but is not present in CTLL-2 cells (data not shown). However, forced expression of Lyn could not confer EPO-dependent growth on T-JER cells. Therefore, CTLL-2 may lack multiple factors that transduce signals efficiently from EPOR/JAK2 to the MAP cascade. As shown in Fig. 4 B, the kinetics of MAP kinase activation in T-JJER cells by IL2 and EPO were different, suggesting that IL2 receptors may utilize different adaptor systems to the MAP cascade from the EPOR. We thank H. Ohgusu and M. Sasaki for their excellent technical assistance and Dr. Hirano and Dr. Hibi for Gab1 and Gab2 cDNAs."

In addition, C-terminal deletion mutants of Sam68 exhibit a transdominant negative phenotype in HIV replication. We now report that Sam68 also enhances the activities of Rev-like proteins of other complex retroviruses (e.g. HTLV-1 and EIAV) on their respective RNA targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Sam68 can function alone as well as synergize with Rev-MS2 and/or Rex-MS2 chimeric proteins on expression mediated by the corresponding RRE-MS2 fusion RNA element. Additionally, dominant negative mutants of Sam68 also repressed the synergistic activation of Sam68 with Rex, E-Rev, and/or Rev-MS2/Rex-MS2 on their corresponding RNA targets. Thus, Sam68 may play an important role in the post-transcriptional regulation of all complex retroviruses."

Here we describe a novel form of regulation of StAR gene expression in steroidogenic cells. Treatment of Y-1 BS1 adrenocortical cells with either low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) increases expression of endogenous StAR mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of StAR mRNA by lipoprotein requires basal cAMP-dependent protein kinase, since the inhibitor, R p-8-Br-cAMP, inhibited induction of StAR protein by LDL. Likewise, basal StAR expression or LDL induction of StAR protein was not detectable in Y-1 kin-8 cells which are deficient in cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole were used to determine if side chain cleavage of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol is required for induction of StAR mRNA. Treatment with either drug alone induced StAR mRNA expression 1.5–3-fold, while induction of StAR in cells treated with either drug plus LDL, was equal to, or greater than, induction seen with either agent alone, suggesting that lipoprotein does not regulate StAR via generation of an oxysterol intermediate. Both LDL and HDL increased expression of a mouse −966 StAR promoter-reporter construct 1.5–2.5-fold, indicating that regulation occurs at the level of transcription. In contrast, neither lipoprotein was able to induce transcription from a −966 StAR promoter in which the steroidogenic factor-1 site at −135 was abolished, indicating that regulation of StAR transcription by lipoproteins requires steroidogenic factor-1.

In adrenocortical cells, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)1 stimulates hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters in lipid droplets, and transport of free cholesterol to mitochondria for use in steroid synthesis (1Orme-Johnson N.

How free cholesterol in the outer mitochondrial membrane is transferred to the P450-cholesterol side chain cleavage (P450-SCC) complex on the inner mitochondrial membrane is unclear, and the existence of a hormonally regulated, labile protein which facilitates this transfer had been predicted for many years (1Orme-Johnson N.

The recently discovered steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is a 30-kDa mitochondrial protein which has many of the characteristics of this regulator (3Pon L. Hartigan J. Orme-Johnson N. J.

StAR has been demonstrated to promote movement of cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane where P450-SCC catalyzes the first, and rate-limiting, enzymatic step in steroid synthesis (5Stocco D.

In addition, expression of StAR promotes steroidogenesis, and directly facilitates the transfer of cholesterol and other sterols in reconstituted mitochondria (7Wang X. Liu Z. Eimerl S. Timberg R.

In this autosomal recessive disorder, gonadal and adrenal steroid production are blocked at the level of cholesterol side chain cleavage, resulting in a massive accumulation of cholesterol in the adrenal glands (10Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss J.I. Clark B. Stocco D. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Likewise, mice in which the StAR gene is disrupted have a severe reduction in corticosterone synthesis and accumulate massive lipid deposits in their adrenal cortex (12Caron K. Soo S.-C. Wetsel W.

Other reports demonstrate that StAR transcription can be regulated by oxysterols (20Christenson L. McAllister J. Martin K. Javitt N. Osborne T. Strauss J.F. J. Biol.

Since the net result of ACTH stimulation is an increase in free cholesterol at the outer mitochondrial membrane, the current studies were undertaken to ask if the expression of StAR is regulated directly by lipoproteins, the major source of cholesterol for steroid synthesis in adrenocortical cells. Our studies demonstrate that lipoproteins regulate StAR expression by a mechanism that is dependent on cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the transcription factor SF-1. The regulation of StAR expression by cholesterol may represent a positive feedback circuit designed to maintain maximal output of steroid hormone.

Increased expression of StAR, together with increased cholesterol substrate availability, enables adrenocortical cells to rapidly increase steroid hormone synthesis (1Orme-Johnson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 213-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The present studies were undertaken to ask if lipoproteins, the major source of cholesterol in steroid producing cells, can regulate StAR expression. For these studies we used the Y-1 BS1 subclone (22Schimmer B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This subclone differs from parental Y-1 cells, in that in addition to LDL, it is also able to use HDL for steroidogenesis (22Schimmer B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, Y-1 BS1 cells were cholesterol-starved for 24 h prior to the addition of LDL (50 μg/ml) purified from human plasma. Fig.1 A shows a Northern blot of StAR mRNA expression in Y-1 BS1 cells harvested at various times following the addition of LDL. Two major StAR transcripts of about 3.4 and 1.6 kilobases, and a third minor transcript of about 2.7 kilobases, are seen in Y-1 BS1 cells. The data in Fig. 1 A is quantified in Fig. 1 B, which shows the sum of all three StAR transcripts normalized to GAPDH mRNA expression. As seen here, the addition of LDL results in an approximately 2–3-fold increase in the expression of all three StAR mRNA transcripts. Induction of StAR mRNA occurs between 4 and 8 h following the addition of LDL, and is sustained for at least 30 h. In contrast to the delayed regulation of StAR by lipoprotein, ACTH induces StAR mRNA by 2 h, StAR expression is maximal by 4 h, and returns to basal levels after 24–48 h (Fig.2, A and B). This data suggests that the early, but somewhat transient, increase in StAR expression induced by ACTH is followed by a more sustained lipoprotein induced increase in StAR.Figure 1Time course of induction of StAR by LDL.A, Y-1 BS1 cells were cholesterol starved in Ham's F-10 containing 0.5% BSA for 24 h.

The graph shows the average of duplicate measurements in a single representative experiment plus one-half of the range between samples. This experiment has been repeated twice with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although induction of StAR by LDL does not require pretreatment with ACTH, in many experiments we have observed that ACTH can modestly increase the induction of StAR mRNA by lipoproteins without altering the time course or dose response (data not shown). Fig.3 shows a dose response of induction of StAR mRNA by HDL and LDL in Y-1 BS1 cells pretreated with ACTH. As seen here, the addition of either HDL or LDL increases expression of StAR mRNA 2–3-fold. Although they are equally as potent at the lower concentrations (25–50 μg/ml), the maximal increase in StAR expression following the addition of LDL is typically greater than that seen with HDL. Fig. 3 B shows quantification of the dose-response experiment shown in Fig. 3 A. A concentration of LDL as low as 10 μg/ml increases expression of StAR, with maximal induction at 50–100 μg/ml. In contrast, the HDL effect on StAR expression is more modest and appears to decrease at concentrations of HDL above 50 μg/ml. In the experiment shown in Fig. 4, StAR protein abundance in the mitochondria of Y-1 BS1 cells was analyzed by immunoblot in ACTH-pretreated cells incubated with increasing amounts of HDL or LDL. As little as 10 μg/ml of either lipoprotein results in a modest increase in StAR protein, while incubation of cells with 25 μg/ml HDL or LDL further increases StAR protein. At higher concentrations of HDL, StAR protein expression decreases, an effect similar to that observed for StAR mRNA expression (Fig. 4). Similar results are seen when total cellular protein is assayed, indicating that increased protein abundance at the mitochondria reflects an increase in StAR protein expression (data not shown). The relatively late induction of StAR mRNA by lipoprotein compared with ACTH, and the fact that pretreatment with ACTH is not required for induction of StAR by lipoprotein, suggests that distinct regulatory mechanisms may control StAR induction by these two pathways. However, our observation that pretreatment with ACTH can enhance lipoprotein regulation of StAR suggests that these pathways may share a common intermediate. The actions of ACTH are mediated through stimulation of cAMP production and the subsequent activation of PKA (1Orme-Johnson N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 213-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To determine if regulation of StAR by lipoprotein requires PKA, we have usedR p-8-Br-cAMP, a competitive inhibitor of cAMP, which blocks the activation of PKA. Previous work from our laboratory indicates that R p-8-Br-cAMP blocks basal and cAMP-induced steroidogenesis in Y-1 cells (26Reyland M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, A and B, Y-1 BS1 cells were pretreated with R p-8-Br-cAMP followed by the addition of human LDL. As seen here, inhibition of PKA activation with R p-8-Br-cAMP nearly totally blocks the induction of StAR protein by LDL (Fig. 5 A, lane 3 versus lane 4), indicating that PKA is required for this pathway. As a second approach to verify that PKA is required for the induction of StAR by LDL, we utilized the Y-1 mutant cell line, Y-1 kin-8 which is defective in the activation of PKA due to a mutation in the type I regulatory subunit (23Rae P.A. Gutman N.S. Tsao J. Schimmer B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1896-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5 C, both LDL and ACTH induce StAR protein expression in Y-1 BS1 cells. However, basal expression of StAR is absent from Y-1 Kin-8 cells, and StAR expression is not inducible by either LDL or ACTH in these cells. This supports our findings with R p-8-Br-cAMP that a functional PKA pathway is required for regulation of StAR by LDL. Oxysterols regulate many key events in cholesterol metabolism (27Dawson P.

Side chain cleavage of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol is one mechanism by which regulatory oxysterols may be generated in steroidogenic cells. We have used two chemical inhibitors to determine if P450-SCC activity is required for regulation of StAR gene expression by lipoproteins. Aminoglutethimide is primarily an inhibitor of P450-SCC activity, although inhibition of other P450-steroid hydroxylases has also been reported (31Vanden Bossche H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1003-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ketoconazole has multiple effects on steroidogenic cells including inhibition of P450-SCC and other steroid hydroylases, inhibition of de novo cholesterol biosynthesis, and up-regulation of LDL receptor expression (31Vanden Bossche H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1003-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Y-1 BS1 cells were cholesterol starved for 24 h, followed by the addition of LDL, with or without aminoglutethimide (Fig.6) or ketoconazole (Fig.7), for an additional 24 h. Commercial preparations of human LDL from two different suppliers were used for these experiments. StAR mRNA expression was analyzed by Northern blotting (Figs. 6 A and 7 A); quantification of the data is shown in Figs. 6 B and7 B. As seen in Fig. 6, treatment of Y-1 BS1 cells with aminoglutethimide alone results in a 1.5–2-fold increase in expression of StAR mRNA, whereas StAR is induced 1.5–2.5-fold in cells treated with LDL alone. When cells were pretreated with aminoglutethimide followed by the addition of LDL, the fold induction of StAR mRNA is greater than the additive effect of both agents alone. Nearly identical results were seen when ketoconazole was used to block P450-SCC activity. Fig. 7 shows that the induction of StAR mRNA by LDL was not blocked by ketoconazole, since StAR mRNA expression in the presence of ketoconazole and LDL was greater than the additive effect of either agent alone. P450-SCC activity, as determined by the ability of Y-1 BS1 cells to convert [3H]cholesterol to [3H]pregnenolone, was inhibited by >98% in aminoglutethimide and >95% in ketoconazole-treated cells (data not shown). These results indicate that side chain cleavage of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol is not required for the regulation of StAR mRNA by lipoproteins, suggesting that generation of an oxysterol intermediate is not required for this pathway. Treatment with either aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole alone results in a substantial increase in the expression of StAR mRNA. The experiment in Fig. 8 shows a dose response for induction of StAR mRNA in Y-1 BS1 cells treated for 7 h with aminoglutethimide or ketoconazole. As seen here, treatment with either P450-SCC inhibitor induces StAR mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum induction of StAR is seen at 500 μm aminoglutethimide or 25 μmketoconazole. Similarly, in other experiments both aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole are able to increase expression of StAR protein (data not shown). Both inhibitors have been shown to increase cellular cholesterol (32Privalle C. Crivello J. Jefcoate C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 33Takagi K. Alvarez J. Favata M. Trzaskos J. Strauss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12352-12357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the case of aminoglutethimide, cholesterol has been shown to accumulate at the inner mitochondrial membrane (32Privalle C. Crivello J. Jefcoate C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Thus these results are consistent with the hypothesis that an increase in, or transit through, a specific regulatory pool of cholesterol signals the increased expression of StAR mRNA and protein. To determine the molecular level at which StAR expression is regulated, we have used a transient transfection approach to ask if LDL and/or HDL can regulate transcription of the StAR promoter. Fig.9 A shows an experiment in which transcription from a mouse StAR promoter-reporter construct, −966StAR/luc, was assayed in Y-1 BS1 cells treated with increasing doses of LDL or HDL for 7 h. As seen here, the addition of LDL to cells transiently transfected with −966StAR/luc results in a 2.5-fold increase in StAR promoter transcription. Maximum induction of StAR transcription is seen at 50 μg/ml LDL, a dose similar to that required for maximal induction of StAR mRNA and protein (see Figs.3 and 4). The addition of HDL to cells transiently transfected with −966StAR/luc results in a more modest increase in StAR transcription of about 1.5–2-fold, with maximal induction of transcription at 25–50 μg/ml HDL. Typically the transcriptional response to both LDL and HDL is diminished at 100 mg/ml lipoprotein, although this is seen most dramatically in the case of LDL (Fig. 9 A). Transcriptional regulation of the StAR promoter does not require pretreatment with ACTH, and is maximal 6 h following the addition of LDL or HDL to transfected cells (data not shown). These studies indicate that the regulation of StAR transcription, as well as StAR mRNA and protein by lipoproteins, are similar in terms of the kinetics and magnitude of induction, indicating that lipoproteins primarily regulate StAR gene expression at the point of transcription. Analysis of the mouse StAR promoter has identified a functional SF-1 DNA-binding site at −135. Mutagenesis of this site results in loss of basal, but not ACTH, induced transcription in Y-1 cells (16Caron K. Ikeda Y. Soo S.-C. Stocco D. Parker K. Clark B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To determine if lipoproteins regulate StAR transcription via a SF-1-dependent mechanism, we have analyzed transcription from a p-966StAR/lucSF1–135 promoter-reporter construct in which the SF-1 site at −135 is mutated. As seen in Fig. 9 B, mutation of this site results in a 3-fold decrease in basal promoter activity as previously reported (16Caron K. Ikeda Y. Soo S.-C. Stocco D. Parker K. Clark B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Mutation of the SF-1 site also nearly totally abolishes induction of the wild type −966 StAR promoter by LDL and HDL. To verify that the SF-1 site at −135 is the predominant determinant of lipoprotein-induced StAR transcription, we used a series of 5′ deletion mutants to further analyze the −966 StAR promoter (Fig.9 C). As expected, induction of StAR transcription by LDL or HDL is nearly abolished in the p-113StAR promoter, in which the SF-1 site at −135 is missing. In contrast, both HDL and LDL are able to induce transcription from the p-254 and p-426StAR promoter constructs. These studies demonstrate that a region between −113 and −254 in the mouse StAR promoter is required for lipoprotein induction of StAR, and support our studies using site-directed mutagenesis that the SF-1 site at −135 is essential for StAR regulation by lipoprotein. In this report we demonstrate that lipoprotein particles regulate StAR gene expression in adrenocortical cells via a mechanism which requires PKA. Regulation of StAR by lipoprotein occurs at the level of transcription and is dependent on the transcription factor SF-1. Inhibitors of P450-SCC do not block the induction of StAR by lipoproteins, indicating that this regulation is not mediated by an oxysterol intermediate. However, aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole alone are able to increase StAR expression. Since these agents, as well as lipoproteins, are known to increase cellular cholesterol levels, our studies implicate cholesterol, or a cholesterol derivative, as a positive regulator of StAR in adrenocortical cells. While HDL is the chief source of cholesterol for steroidogenesis in rodent cells (34Gwynne J. Mahaffee D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8141-8150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both LDL and HDL are able to supply cholesterol for steroidogenesis in the Y-1 BS1 cells (22Schimmer B. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Our studies show that treatment of cholesterol-starved Y-1 BS1 cells with LDL or HDL results in a 1.5–3-fold increase in StAR mRNA and protein synthesis, as well as transcription from the mouse StAR promoter. LDL is a better inducer of StAR than HDL, possibly due to the fact that more cholesterol is being delivered to the cell per mg of lipoprotein, since the cholesterol to protein ratio of LDL is typically twice that of HDL. Interestingly, induction of StAR is saturated at 25–50 μg/ml of either lipoprotein, and in some experiments StAR expression appears to decrease at higher concentrations of LDL or HDL. This may be due to a limitation in a key regulatory molecule, or it may reflect lipoprotein uptake and/or receptor density. We have observed that pretreatment of Y-1 BS1 cells with ACTH can enhance the induction of StAR by lipoproteins (data not shown). This may be due, in part, to the up-regulation of lipoprotein receptors. PKA is known to regulate the expression of the LDL receptor (35Kovanen P. Goldstein J. Chappell D. Brown M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5591-5598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as a recently described HDL receptor, scavenger receptor-B1 (36Rigotti A. Edelman E. Seifert P. Iqbal S. DeMattos R. Temel R. Krieger M. Williams D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33545-33949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrates that LDL regulation of StAR, as well as basal expression of StAR, requires a functional PKA pathway. This data also indicates that PKA is activated in Y-1 BS1 cells in the absence of exogenous ACTH, and that this basal level of activation is sufficient for lipoprotein induction of StAR. This is in agreement with previous data from our laboratory that shows that Y-1 cells have a high rate of basal steroid production, indicating that PKA is activated in these cells (26Reyland M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1021-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since regulation of StAR by cAMP and LDL appear to diverge at the level of transcription, PKA presumably facilitates lipoprotein regulation of StAR at a point prior to transcription. Given the well established role of PKA (via ACTH) in LDL uptake and metabolism, as well as cholesterol mobilization and transport (31Vanden Bossche H. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 43: 1003-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 37Acton S. Scherer P. Lodish H. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it seems likely that the PKA pathway is required in order for the cell to accumulate lipoprotein-derived cholesterol in the appropriate regulatory pool. Accumulation of cholesterol in this pool then could be the signal for increased StAR transcription. Regulation of StAR transcription and mRNA expression by lipoproteins are nearly identical in terms of the kinetics and magnitude of induction, as well as the dose response, suggesting that transcription is the primary mode of regulation. Regulation of StAR transcription by lipoproteins is absolutely dependent on an intact SF-1 site at −135 SF-1 site in the mouse StAR promoter. This site has been shown to interact specifically with SF-1 in Y-1 cells and appears to be critical for basal, but not ACTH, stimulated transcription of StAR (16Caron K. Ikeda Y. Soo S.-C. Stocco D. Parker K. Clark B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 138-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast, the cAMP and SF-1 responsive elements of the human and rat promoter map to the same site and Sandhoff et al.(14Sandhoff T. Hales D. Hales K. McLean M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 4820-4831Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) shown that SF-1 alone confers cAMP responsiveness to the StAR promoter. While our data indicates that basal and lipoprotein-mediated regulation of StAR share a common transcription element, cAMP regulation and lipoprotein regulation of StAR appear to diverge at the point of transcription. These divergent transcriptional effects may explain the differences in the time course of induction of StAR by lipoprotein and ACTH shown in Figs. 1 and 2. One mechanism by which lipoproteins may regulate StAR expression could be through the generation of oxysterol intermediates from cholesterol. This is an attractive hypothesis since our data indicates that lipoproteins regulate StAR via the transcription factor SF-1, and oxysterols have been reported to be a ligand for both SF-1 as well as another orphan nuclear receptor, LXR (38Lala D. Syka P. Lazarchik S. Mangelsdorf D. Parker K. Heyman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4895-4900Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 39Janowski B. Willy P. Devi T. Falck J. Mangelsdorf D. Nature. 1996; 383: 728-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent report suggests that oxysterols are able to regulate StAR transcription in non-steroid producing cells (20Christenson L. McAllister J. Martin K. Javitt N. Osborne T. Strauss J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30729-30735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). While aminoglutethimide and ketoconazole both blocked P450-SCC activity by >95%, neither inhibitor had any effect on the induction of StAR by lipoprotein. Although these inhibitors may not totally block the generation of all oxysterols, the lack of an effect of either inhibitor on LDL-induced StAR expression strongly suggests that oxysterols are not an intermediate in lipoprotein regulation of StAR expression. Interestingly, both inhibitors induced StAR mRNA expression on their own. In addition, in data not presented here, both inhibitors induced a 2–4-fold increase of StAR protein in Y-1 BS1 cells. The induction of StAR in the presence of either inhibitor plus lipoprotein was typically greater than the sum of induction of StAR in the presence of the inhibitors or lipoprotein alone. This suggests that they may work through the same mechanism, and that this mechanism can be saturated. Aminoglutethimide is known to increase cholesterol at the inner mitochondrial membrane (32Privalle C. Crivello J. Jefcoate C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Likewise, ketoconazole increases cellular cholesterol mass (33Takagi K. Alvarez J. Favata M. Trzaskos J. Strauss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12352-12357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and up-regulates expression of the LDL receptor, which may in turn contribute to the accumulation of cholesterol at the mitochondria (33Takagi K. Alvarez J. Favata M. Trzaskos J. Strauss J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12352-12357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our data suggests a model whereby delivery of cholesterol to the mitochondria triggers the induction of StAR gene expression. We demonstrate that both lipoproteins and inhibitors of P450-SCC are able to positively regulate StAR expression. While treatment with P450-SCC inhibitors may result in a net accumulation of cholesterol at the mitochondria, in the presence of an active P450-SCC complex, lipoprotein-delivered cholesterol is not expected to accumulate. Thus we propose that StAR expression is regulated by either an increase in the cholesterol mass of, or perhaps an increase in the rate of cholesterol transient through, a specific regulatory pool. The regulation of StAR expression by cholesterol may represent a positive feedback circuit that plays a role in cholesterol homeostasis by linking cholesterol availability with steroidogenic output.

In mammals, in particular, it is characterized by the transient appearance of a group of proteins, namely TP1, TP2, and TP4 which replace the somatic and testis-specific histones, before themselves being replaced by protamines (1Meistrich M.L. Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 165-182Google Scholar). The biological significance of the role of transition proteins in chromatin remodeling, in mammals, is a matter of great importance to understand the final stages of sperm development and maturation in the testis. Among the three basic proteins, TP1, TP2, and TP4, TP1 was shown to be a DNA melting protein in vitro and has been speculated to be involved in the destabilization of nucleosome to facilitate displacement of histones (2Singh J. Rao M.R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 734-740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Singh J. Rao M.R.S. Biochem. Int. 1988; 17: 701-710PubMed Google Scholar). More recently Yu et al. (4Yu Y.E. Zhang Y. Unni E. Shirley C.R. Deng J.M. Russel L.D. Weil M.M. Behringer R.R. Meistrich M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4683-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) have shown that TP1-deficient mice have abnormal spermatogenesis with reduced fertility. TP4 has been shown recently to stimulate SV40 DNA relaxing activity of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase I suggesting a probable role in chromatin reorganization (5Akama K. Kondo M. Sato H. Nakano M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 442: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). On the other hand, more information is available regarding DNA binding properties of TP2. TP2, in contrast with TP1, was shown to have DNA condensing properties (6Baskaran R. Rao M.R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21039-21047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rat TP2 is a zinc metalloprotein, containing two atoms of zinc per molecule (7Baskaran R. Rao M.R.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1991; 179: 1491-1499Google Scholar), condenses GC-rich DNA more than other types of DNA sequences (8Kundu T.K. Rao M.R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5143-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and recognizes a human CpG island sequence in a zinc-dependent manner (9Kundu T.K. Rao M.R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15626-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Methylation of cysteine residue in the CpG doublet inhibited the recognition of the CpG island sequence by TP2. Chromomycin A3 interference experiments revealed that probably one of the modes of interaction of TP2 with GC-rich DNA is through its minor groove. These results suggested that CpG islands might serve as specific loci for initiation of chromatin condensation by TP2 through its zinc-binding domain.For a better understanding of the nature of interaction of TP2 with DNA, it is necessary to delineate the zinc-binding domains of TP2. A careful examination of the amino acid sequence of rat TP2 and its alignment with the known zinc fingers did not reveal any similarity. In addition, TP2 has many more number of histidine and cysteine residues than that are necessary for coordinating two atoms of zinc. We, therefore, undertook the challenge to identify the amino acid residues involved in zinc coordination by employing extensive site-directed mutagenesis of cysteine and histidine residues present in TP2. The results presented here reveal novel zinc finger modules in TP2. We have further carried out transient transfection experiments in COS-7 cells with wild type and mutant forms of TP2 and the results show that wild type TP2 preferentially localizes to nucleolus. We have also identified the amino acid stretch that is necessary for nuclear localization (NLS)1 of TP2.RESULTSThe cDNA derived amino acid sequence of rat TP2 is shown in Fig. 1. The protein has 5 cysteine and 11 histidine residues most of which are distributed in the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule. There is a convenient glutamate residue at the 86th position. Cleavage of TP2 with V8 protease generates the N-terminal two-thirds and C-terminal one-third and we have conveniently used this division in all our experimental approach. We developed a single step purification procedure for the purification of recombinant wild type and mutant TP2 (partial synthetic cDNA) expressed in E. coli based on the very basic nature of the C-terminal region of TP2. The SDS-PAGE pattern of the different fractions is shown in Fig. 2 A. The bound TP2 protein that could be eluted from heparin-agarose column with 1 m NaCl showed a single band on the polyacrylamide gel.Identification of Zinc Binding Pockets in TP2The single and multiple mutants of TP2 involving cysteine and histidine residues were generated by the method described recently (12Meetei A.R. Rao M.R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The BL21(DE3) cells harboring the various mutants were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified as described above. Since the N-terminal two-thirds of TP2-(1–86) can still bind zinc with equal efficiency as native TP2 (15Kundu T.K. Rao M.R.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the histidine residue at position 102 was not included in the mutagenesis studies. The wild type and mutant TP2 proteins were checked for their zinc binding capacity by quantitative 65zinc dot blot analysis. The quantitative nature of zinc binding to TP2 was established by monitoring the linearity of 65zinc binding to TP2 as a function of increasing concentration of TP2. A duplicate analysis of such a 65zinc blot is shown in the bottom panelof Fig. 2 B while the linearity curve as analyzed by densitometric scan is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 B. It is clear that the method employed is linear in the range of protein concentration used in these experiments. Radioactive zinc blotting has also been used recently to analyze the zinc binding efficiencies of RNA polymerase II subunits and their mutants (16Donalson I.M. Friesen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13780-13788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) using very similar procedure. In all the subsequent experiments, TP2 (wild type and mutants) were spotted at 5 μg concentration and the purity of the proteins as analyzed by SDS-PAGE is shown in each of the figures. Fig. 3 shows the65zinc binding analysis of wild type TP2 and its various mutants. The middle panel shows the autoradiogram obtained after 65zinc binding. The histogram showing the extent of65zinc binding by the various mutants in comparison to wild type TP2 (taken as 100%) is shown at the top of each figure. Each of the binding experiments was done in triplicate and the percent binding shown in the figure is an average ± S.D of these independent experiments. The observation made in Fig. 3 A can be summarized as follows. The H43Q,H58Q,H64Q,H74Q mutant did not affect zinc binding. On the other hand, H12Q,H16Q,H24Q, and H12Q,H16Q,H24Q,H33Q,H34Q,H43Q, H58Q,H64Q,H74Q mutants had only 56 and 58% zinc binding capacity, respectively, as compared with wild type TP2. Since TP2 binds two atoms of zinc, a reduction of 40–50%65zinc binding can be taken as the loss of one zinc-binding site. Thus, these results suggest that His12, His16, and His24 are involved in binding one atom of zinc while there was no contribution from His43, His58, His64, and His74. The fourth histidine residue involved in the coordination of zinc in this module was identified as His14 by single mutant studies in the background of other zinc pocket mutant (see below), as multiple mutants could not be generated involving His14 due to the overlapping sequence in the mutagenic primers used in this region. Among the cysteine mutants, the C29A,C31A, C35A,C38A mutant had only 56% zinc binding capacity (lane 5) indicating that it has lost one zinc-binding site retaining the site involving histidine residues. The involvement of each of the two zinc binding pockets was further confirmed by the observation that the double pocket mutant, H12Q,H16Q,H24Q/C29A,C31A,C35A, C38A mutant lost 98.5% of the zinc binding capacity (lane 6). The non-involvement of His43, His58, His64, and His74 in zinc coordination is evident from lane 7 wherein mutation at these positions did not further decrease the zinc binding activity to near 0%. As mentioned above, there are 5 cysteine residues in TP2. The results described above indicate that Cys29, Cys31, Cys35, and Cys38 form the second pocket for coordination with zinc. To rule out any contribution of the fifth cysteine (Cys78) residue, mutants were created to include Cys78 and the results obtained with H58Q,H64Q/C78A showed only about 6% reduction in zinc binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 1).In the next series of experiments, single mutants of TP2 were created to substantiate the conclusions drawn above. The histidine mutants at positions 12, 14, and 16 had approximately 62, 63, and 64% zinc binding activity, respectively, compared with wild type TP2 while H33Q,H34Q did not have any effect on zinc binding (Fig. 3 C). The H24Q mutant had approximately 76% zinc binding activity. Theoretically one would have expected a near 50% reduction in zinc binding activity. It is possible that the fourth coordinating molecule in the H24Q mutant might be partially served by a water molecule (17Christianson D.W. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 281-355Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among the cysteine mutants, C29A, C31A, C35A, and C38A resulted in a 43, 48, 48, and 48% reduction in zinc binding activity, respectively, clearly indicating that they are involved in zinc coordination in TP2. These results further indicate that all the four residues in each of the zinc-binding pocket is necessary for zinc coordination. Even a loss of a single coordination site abolishes the zinc binding activity of that pocket.Fig. 4, A and B,show the results of experiments wherein mutations were created at each of the coordinating amino acids of one pocket while the other pocket was a complete mutant. It is clear from Fig. 4 A that H12Q,H16Q,H24Q (lane 2), H12Q,H16Q,H24Q,H33Q (lane 5), and H12Q,H16Q,H24Q, H34Q (lane 6) had lost 40–50% zinc binding activity. With this mutant in background (H12Q,H16Q,H24Q), a single mutation each at Cys29, Cys31, Cys35, and Cys38 resulted in a complete loss of zinc binding activity (lanes 3, 4, 7, and8). The fact that each of the secondary mutants at the cysteine residue resulted in a complete loss of zinc binding activity, it can be concluded that these cysteine residues form one zinc binding pocket. A similar set of experiments was done for single histidine mutants in the background of the C29A,C31A,C35A,C38A/H43Q,H58Q,H64Q,H74Q mutant. It was shown in Fig. 3 B that His43, His58, His64, and His74 are not involved in zinc coordination. The results presented in Fig. 4 B show that mutations at His12, His14, and His16 resulted in a total loss of zinc binding activity. The zinc binding activity of H24Q (lane 6) was 28% although this also should have resulted in a total loss of zinc binding activity. As discussed above, a water molecule may be serving for the fourth coordination ligand for zinc.Figure 465 Zinc blot analysis of different mutants of TP2.

Fig. 4 C shows the SDS-PAGE pattern of E. coli cells harboring the expression plasmid with and without isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. A 30-kDa band was clearly seen in the induced lane corresponding to the GST-TP2 fusion protein which was subsequently purified by affinity chromatography. The bottom panel in Fig. 4 D shows the SDS-PAGE of the wild type fusion protein and the various mutants derived from it. The GST alone did not bind any 65zinc, however, the GST-TP2 fusion protein did bind 65zinc. Both the cysteine and histidine mutant peptides lost about 54 and 48%65zinc binding activity, respectively. The total histidine and cysteine mutant lost all the 65zinc binding activity. A GST fusion protein, which had TP2 sequence (43–86), did not possess any 65zinc binding activity (lane 6).Based on all these results, we propose the zinc finger modules coordinating the two zinc atoms in TP2 as shown in Fig. 5. The TP2 zinc finger modules that we have delineated do not correspond to any of the known zinc finger modules present in steroid and thyroid hormone receptors or RING finger or transcription factors TFIIIA and GATA 1 or binuclear zinc cluster of GAL 4. The major features of the zinc finger modules of TP2 are the following: 1) the first finger is made up of four coordinating histidine residues, 2) there is only one amino acid between the first and the second and the second and the third coordinating histidine residues that happens to be proline. Its mutation to alanine, however, did not affect zinc binding activity (Fig. 4 E). There are seven amino acids between the third and the fourth coordinating histidine residues out of which there is a lone arginine residue at position 20. In many of the known zinc fingers, it has been demonstrated that zinc fingers make contact with nucleic acid bases (mostly guanine) predominantly through an arginine residue (18Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 19Wolfe S.A. Greisman H.A. Ramm E.I. Pabo C.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1917-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). 3) The second zinc finger module is made up of four cysteine residues. 4) There is a single amino acid between the first and the second coordinating cysteine residues. 5) Three amino acids separate the second and the third coordinating cysteine residues. 6) Two amino acids separate the third and the fourth coordinating cysteine residues and one happens to be arginine at position 36. Mutation of either of the arginine residues 20 or 36 to alanine did not affect zinc binding activity (Fig. 4 F). 7) There are no conserved amino acids such as Phe, Leu, Ile, and Val in both the modules as observed in other zinc finger proteins.Figure 5Zinc finger modules of TP2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Transient Expression of Wild Type and Mutant TP2 in COS-7 CellsTo understand the in vivo physiological significance of TP2 and its various DNA-binding domains, we have begun to carry out ectopic expression analysis of TP2 and its mutants in COS-7 cells. Since TP2 is expressed only in the male germ cells during spermiogenesis and the fact that the process of spermatogenesis involves several waves of germ cells differentiating asynchronously, the effect of its ectopic expression in cells in culture should give valuable information on this protein. An ideal situation of studying the effect of expression of TP2 would be with round spermatids. However, culturing of round spermatids isolated from testicular cells,in vitro, has not been demonstrated yet. In the absence of such a culture system, we have used COS-7 cells as the experimental model system. Although TP2 is unique to rat testis and not expressed in a somatic cell, such a study would definitely give some insights into the effect of expression of TP2 on cellular events in general. For this purpose, we subcloned the wild type TP2 (containing the natural codons) and its various mutants into pCMX PL1 whose expression is driven by the constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter. The expression of wild type TP2 and its mutants in COS-7 cells was monitored by immunofluorescence using monospecific rabbit anti-TP2 antibodies. These antibodies reacted with both wild type and mutant TP2s with equal efficiency in a Western blot analysis (data not shown). The immunofluorescence patterns as well as the corresponding 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei are shown in Fig. 6. The most interesting observation that can be made from this figure is that wild type TP2 preferentially localizes to nucleolus (panel d). There are two cells showing the immunofluorescence pattern of TP2 with different levels of expression. When the expression is low, TP2 is predominantly localized to nucleolus. When there is a higher level of expression of TP2, it is also observed in nucleoplasm in addition to the nucleolus. The expression and localization pattern of the zinc finger pocket mutants also reveal some interesting features. There was no appreciable difference in the localization pattern of histidine pocket mutant because the mutant TP2 also preferentially localized in the nucleolus (panel f). However, interestingly, the cysteine pocket mutant did not show such preferential localization to nucleolus and most of the expressed protein was observed in the nucleoplasm (panel h). The double histidine and cysteine pocket mutants behaved like the cysteine pocket mutant (panel j). The localization pattern of the two arginine mutants (R20A and R36A) behaved like wild type TP2 (panels l and n). As mentioned earlier, there is a single glutamate residue at position 86 based on which we have assigned the N-terminal two-thirds as the DNA recognition domain with its two zinc fingers and the C-terminal one-third having stretches of basic amino acid residues as the DNA condensation domain (8Kundu T.K. Rao M.R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5143-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9Kundu T.K. Rao M.R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15626-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). When a TP2 construct in pCMX PL1 vector containing only the N-terminal two-thirds of the molecule-(1–86) was transfected into COS-7 cells, this partial TP2 was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm (panel p) indicating the presence of a potential nuclear localization signal in the C-terminal third of TP2 (Fig. 8). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of TP2 revealed that the amino acid stretch 87GKVSKRKAV95 had strong homology to monopartite NLS (14Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). We therefore, generated TP2 construct in pCMX PL-1 vector containing amino acid residues 1 to 95. When transfected into COS-7 cells, this fragment was now localized to the nucleus (panel r) indicating that this sequence indeed corresponds to NLS in TP2. Interestingly TP2 was found only in the nucleoplasm but not in the nucleolus. To further corroborate this conclusion, we deleted this stretch of amino acids from TP2 and when transfected with this deletion mutant, the TP2 was again found in the cytoplasm (panel t) similar to that observed in the C-terminal deletion mutant (1–86).Figure 6Immunofluorescence of COS-7 cells transfected with wild type TP2 and its mutants. Wild type and mutant rat TP2 cDNAs, in pCMX PL1, were transfected into COS-7 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 12 h after transfection, immunofluorescence was carried out using monospecific rabbit anti-rat TP2 antibody. Panels d, f, h, j, l, n, p, r,and t show the localization pattern of wild type TP2 and its mutants, Wild type TP2 (d), histidine pocket mutant (f), cysteine pocket mutant (h), histidine and cysteine double pocket mutant (j), R20A mutant (l), R36A mutant (n) C-terminal deletion mutant, (p) C-terminal deletion mutant with NLS-(1–86) (r) and TP2 without the NLS (87–95 deletion mutant) (t). Negative control, COS-7 cells transfected with vector alone, is shown in panel b.

For this purpose we have taken the approach of site-directed mutagenesis to create several mutants of TP2 and then evaluating their 65zinc binding capacity in a quantitative zinc blot analysis. Since multiple mutants had to be created in TP2 involving several combinations of cysteine and histidine residues, we recently developed a novel technique for generating several multiple site-specific mutants of TP2 without a need for cloning each of the mutant generated (12Meetei A.R. Rao M.R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 264: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The radioactive zinc binding studies reported here have clearly identified the cysteine and histidine residues involved in zinc coordination and the emerging model for the two zinc finger modules is shown in Fig. 5 which do not fit into the known zinc finger modules. The Cys2-His2 fingers constitute one of the most important and versatile families of eukaryotic DNA-binding domains, which are present in numerous transcription factors that recognize a diverse set of DNA sequences (18Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar, 19Wolfe S.A. Greisman H.A. Ramm E.I. Pabo C.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1917-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These fingers have provided an important model system for studying the principles of protein-DNA recognition and offer a useful framework for the selection and design of novel DNA-binding proteins (20Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the zinc finger domains with their target DNA-binding sites have revealed a generally conserved DNA-locking arrangement with the α-helix (recognition helix) fitting into the major groove (21Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 22Marmorstein R. Carey M. Ptashne M. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1992; 356: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Amino acids at three key positions on the surface of the recognition helix: −1, 3, and 6 (numbering with respect to start of the α helix) play a dominant role in defining sequence specificity making one to one amino acid to base contacts to a base triplet (contacts on the primary strand involve a three base pair subsite).With this information in background, it is important to discuss the contrasting features of the zinc finger modules of TP2 and its secondary structure. TP2 does not have much α-helicity as predicted by various algorithms as well as by circular dichroism spectroscopic experiments (8Kundu T.K. Rao M.R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5143-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Kundu T.K. Rao M.R.S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has a higher propensity to form β-turns due to the presence of large number of prolines. Although the zinc stabilized structure involves predominantly a type I β-turn structure, a small induced α-helical component was not ruled out. Such spectroscopic studies have now revealed similar results with boar TP2 (23Akama K. Sato H. Oguma K. Nakano M. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1997; 42: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sato H. Akama K. Kojima S. Miura K. Sekine A. Nakano M. Protein Exp. Purif. 1999; 16: 454-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, the structural features of TP2 along with its novel zinc finger modules are completely different from those of the other zinc finger proteins. However, we would like to point out here a major difference, between TP2 and other zinc finger proteins. TP2 shows only sequence preference binding to alternate GC-rich DNA. On the other hand, other known classical zinc finger proteins are sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. Hence the molecular recognition and docking of the zinc finger modules of TP2 with the DNA helix may be completely different from those observed with known classical zinc finger proteins. Some of the preliminary data obtained by us earlier do point out some features of TP2 and DNA interaction. For example, chromomycin A3 interference experiments on the TP2 recognition of the CpG island suggests that TP2 might interact with alternating GC-rich containing DNA predominantly through the minor groove (9Kundu T.K. Rao M.R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15626-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, based on the observation that methylation of cytosine residue in the CpG doublet abolished the binding of TP2 to the CpG island sequence, contribution of the major groove also in the recognition process cannot be ruled out since 5-methyl-cytosine projects toward the major groove in the DNA helix. A more detailed study through NMR/crystallography is necessary to understand the recognition mechanism underlying TP2-DNA interaction.We have also now begun to ask questions as to the effects of ectopic expression of TP2 in a cell culture system. For this purpose the original rat TP2 cDNA clone (containing the natural codons) was put under the regulation of cytomegalovirus promoter and the expression was followed in COS-7 cells using monospecific TP2 antibodies. As mentioned earlier, in the absence of a suitable in vitro cell culture and transfection system available for round spermatids, we have made use of an established cell line, COS-7, for these studies. The most interesting observation of these studies is that wild type TP2 preferentially localizes to nucleolus containing ribosomal DNA, which is GC-rich (25Busch H. Smetana K. The Nucleolus. Academic Press, New York1970: 161-201Google Scholar). The fact that the C-terminal deletion mutant is predominantly localized to cytoplasm suggests that a nuclear localization signal is in the C-terminal fragment."

In addition, understanding these reactions is of importance in attempts to create clusters with new reactivities (14Coldren C.D. Hellinga H.W. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6635-6640Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), to the de novo design of [Fe-S]-containing proteins (14Coldren C.D. Hellinga H.W. Caradonna J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This study focuses on the simplest of these reactions, the interconversion of [3Fe-4S]+/0 and [4Fe-4S]2+/+ clusters. As shown in Fig.1, these two cluster types differ only by the presence or absence of a single Fe atom at one corner of the cube. The well characterized seven-iron ferredoxin from Azotobacter vinelandii, which contains one [3Fe-4S]+/0 and one [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster, is proving to be an excellent model system for elucidating the properties of these redox centers. As shown in Fig. 2, the amino acid sequence Cys-X-X-Cys-X-X-Cys, which provides three of the four cysteine ligands to a [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster, is a very common motif. Interestingly, with one exception, all naturally occurring ferredoxins or ferredoxin variants that contain 4Fe clusters, which can be easily interconverted with 3Fe clusters have instead a Cys-X-X-Asp-X-X-Cys motif. The Asp serves as the ligand that is lost during the cluster interconversion process (23Conover R.C. Kowal A.T. Fu W. Park J.-B. Aono S. Adams M.W.W. Johnson M.K. J. Biol.

The mutation was confirmed at the DNA level by DNA sequencing. A 1.9-kilobase pairClaI-XhoI fragment of A. vinelandiicarrying wild-type fdxA gene was inserted into pBluescript SK−. The fragment containing the mutation was subcloned into pKT230 as described elsewhere (43Vázquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and electroporation was used to introduce the plasmid into the A. vinelandii strain LM100, which contains a disruption of the fdxA gene by a kanamycin resistance cartridge. All A. vinelandii cells were grown under N2-fixing conditions in a 200-liter New Brunswick fermentor (42Shen B. Martin L.L. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J. La Mar G.N. Gorst C.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25928-25939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein purification was carried out at room temperature, and fractions were monitored by their absorbance at 405 nm and by cross-reactivity with antibodies raised against purified FdI, FdIII, or FdIV. The purification was carried out aerobically. Cell-free extracts were prepared from 1 kg of cells, and the first DEAE-cellulose column was run as described previously for the purification of other FdI variants (43Vázquez A. Shen B. Negaard K. Iismaa S. Burgess B. Protein Exp. Purif. 1994; 5: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). From the first DEAE-cellulose column, the FdI fraction eluted at 70–80% of the linear 0.1–0.5m NaCl gradient (total volume = 3 liters) as a very shallow, yet well resolved brown peak. The protein fraction was immediately diluted with three volumes of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and loaded onto a 2.5 × 20-cm DEAE-cellulose column that was preequilibrated with the same buffer. Following loading, the column was washed at the elution rate of 3.0 ml/min for 24 h with 0.12 m KCl in the same buffer until the greenish-brown FdIII (34Gao-Sheridan H.S. Pershad H.R. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5514-5519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) eluted. The brownish FdI with the red-colored FdIV (44Jung Y.-S. Gao-Sheridan H.S. Christiansen J. Dean D.R. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32402-32410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), which was visible on the column immediately following FdIII, was then eluted with 0.3 m KCl. Ammonium sulfate was added slowly to 75% saturation with stirring. After a 30-min incubation, the sample was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was then collected and resuspended in 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, before loading onto a 1.5 × 110-cm Superdex G-75 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column preequilibrated with 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1m NaCl. The brown-colored C42D FdI protein and red-colored FdIV eluted as a single broad peak as observed by monitoring at 405 nm; however, the FdIV actually moved slightly faster than C42D FdI. For that reason, the last third of the peak was collected and concentrated using a Centriplus-10 concentrator (Amicon) prior to further purification on a 1-ml Mono-Q FPLC system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min and a linear gradient of 0.3–0.8 m NaCl in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, over 20 ml. Two fractions were well resolved: the red-colored fraction (FdIV), which eluted between 0.46 and 0.48 m NaCl, and a brown-colored fraction (FdI), which eluted between 0.54 and 0.58m NaCl. Each fraction was collected, buffer-exchanged with 0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and concentrated to 0.5 ml. The C42D protein fraction was further purified with triclinic crystallization. The yield for C42D FdI protein is ∼ 0.5–1 mg/kg of cell paste. To determine iron content, samples were digested, and the analysis was carried out as described previously (45Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) using FeCl3·6H2O to generate a standard curve with FdI and FdIII (34Gao-Sheridan H.S. Pershad H.R. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5514-5519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) as controls. EPR1 spectra were obtained using a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer, interfaced with an Oxford liquid helium cryostat. For spin quantitation of [3Fe-4S]+, the spectrum was recorded at 10 K using 100 μm purified C42D FdI at microwave power of 1 mW. Under those conditions, the EPR signal of FdI is linearly proportional to (microwave power)1/2. 100 μm Cu2+-EDTA, which was used as a standard, was recorded at the same EPR setting and temperature, where the signal is also linear with respect to (power)1/2. The spin concentration was determined by double integration of the signal over the entire field sweep (46Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar). For anaerobic EPR measurement, the samples were loaded into the EPR tubes in an O2-free (O2 < 1 ppm) glove box (Vacuum Atmosphere, Hawthorne, CA). The tubes were sealed with a cap, wrapped with parafilm, and then transferred to the liquid nitrogen Dewar flask. Reduction of FdI was carried out by mixing degassed FdI, 5-deazariboflavin and EDTA (final concentration, 0.2, 0.15, and 10 mm, respectively) in 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and then illuminating the mixture for 1 min using white light from a fiber optics illuminator, model 20 (150 W, Edmond Scientific Co., Barringston, NJ) (34Gao-Sheridan H.S. Pershad H.R. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5514-5519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Using this system, the extent of reduction of the [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster of FdI depends upon the light intensity, light illumination time, media anaerobicity, and absence of other electron acceptors. Oxidation with K3Fe(CN)6 was carried out anaerobically in 0.05m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5; FdI was incubated at room temperature with K3Fe(CN)6 at a molar ratio of 1:3 for 2 h prior to freezing (39Morgan T.V.

For NMR, samples were exchanged into a 0.05 m Tris-buffered D2O solution, pH 7.8, by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5 × 15 cm). The FdI fraction was then concentrated to ∼0.6–1.0 mm by microfiltration with a Centriprep-10 (Amicon, Beverly, MA). 1H 500-MHz NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature using 90° pulses of 8 μs with 0.5-s delay times, using a Bruker GN-500 Fourier transform NMR spectrometer at the NMR facility, University of California, Irvine, CA. About 6000 scans were accumulated for each spectrum over a 2.5-h period. UV-visible absorption spectra were each recorded in a 0.5-ml quartz cuvette on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. CD spectra were obtained using a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter, with the sample contained in a small volume cylindrical cell with fused quartz window. Purified water of resistivity ∼ 18 megohm·cm−1 (Millipore, Bedford, MA) was used in all experiments. The buffers MES, HEPES, and TAPS and the co-adsorbates neomycin or polymyxin (sulfate salts) were purchased from Sigma. An AutoLab electrochemical analyzer (Eco Chemie, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was used to record DC cyclic voltammograms. All experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions in a Vacuum Atmospheres glove box with an inert atmosphere of N2 (<1 ppm). The three-electrode configuration featuring all-glass cells has been described previously (47Armstrong F.A. Butt J.N. Sucheta A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 227: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); this featured a jacketed main cell compartment (typically holding 500 μl), which could be maintained at 0 °C to optimize protein film stability. The saturated calomel reference electrode was held in a Luggin side arm. Prior to each experiment, the pyrolytic graphite “edge” electrode (surface area typically 0.18 cm2) was polished with an aqueous alumina slurry (Buehler Micropolish; 1.0 μm) and sonicated extensively to remove traces of Al2O3. Reduction potentials (E 0′) from cyclic voltammetry were determined from the average of the anodic and the cathodic peak potentials,E 0′ = ½(E pa +E pc) and adjusted to the standard hydrogen electrode scale using E SCE −E SHE + 243 mV at 22 °C (where SCE is saturated calomel reference electrode and SHE is standard hydrogen electrode). Bulk electrochemistry solutions contained between 0.05 and 0.1 mm protein in 60 mm mixed buffer (15 mm HEPES, 15 mm MES, 15 mm TAPS, and 15 mm acetate), with 0.1 m NaCl as supporting electrolyte and 4 mm neomycin. Neomycin stabilizes the protein-electrode interactions. For film solution experiments, solution used to coat the electrode contained approximately 0.1 mm protein in 60 mm mixed buffer, 0.1 mm NaCl, and 200 μg/ml polymyxin at pH 7.0. The cell solution in each case was of similar composition but contained no protein and was adjusted to the required pH with either HCl or NaOH. The pH of the cell solution was measured before and immediately after the experiment. For detailed analysis, voltammograms were corrected for non-faradaic background current by subtracting a polynomial base line (48Heering H.A. Weiner J.H. Armstrong F.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11628-11636Google Scholar). Pulsing experiments were carried out as follows. Films were prepared and then scanned over the normal potential range until the film had stabilized (usually three scans). This voltammogram was then recorded. The protein film was then subjected to an oxidative potential pulse of 0.643 V for 1–4 s. A scan was then taken immediately afterward in the normal potential region, in order to observe the changes that had occurred. Crystals of C42DFdI were grown by the standard methods as described previously (49Stout C.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 205: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 50Shen B. Jollie D.R.

However, the protein appeared to denature quickly in drops that contained higher concentrations of ammonium sulfate. Touchseeding and attempts to macroseed did not work. Macroseeds quickly denatured when placed in preequilibrated drops. A few crystals grew spontaneously after several months' incubation at 4 °C and appeared to be small but regular. These crystals grew in only two of all the drops seeded. Attempts to cryoprotect these crystals did not work. The crystals quickly melted when placed in ammonium sulfate saturated drop buffer supplemented with 20% or 25% glycerol. As a result, after several failed attempts to mount a crystal, the crystal used for data collection was scooped directly out of the drop conditions and frozen in the N2 cryo-stream without cryoprotectant. The structure of native FdI was modeled with a glycine at position 42, and refined by rigid body and positional refinement against all of the data to 2.3-Å resolution (Table I) using Xplor version 3.8 (51Brünger A.T. Karplus M. Petsko G.A. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1989; 45: 50-61Crossref Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The unbiased 2‖Fo ‖ − ‖Fc ‖ and ‖Fo ‖ − ‖Fc ‖ electron density maps clearly revealed the position of the Asp42 side chain with very little other perturbation in the structure. The Asp42 side chain was modeled into the density with Xfit/Xtalview (52McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar), and the structure was refined with isotropic B-factors and a bulk solvent correction using Xplor version 3.8. The Asp42 side chain was restrained to form a 2.1-Å bond to Fe of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, as indicated by the density. The refined model was checked and adjusted against a 2.3-Å resolution 2‖Fo ‖ − ‖Fc ‖ map. A ‖Fo ‖ − ‖Fc ‖ map was used to locate well ordered H2O molecules, which were included in the model and refined. Statistics for the final model are summarized in TableI.

Mutagenesis experiments have shown that even subtle alterations in the environment of the [3Fe-4S]+/0 cluster have profound negative effects on the growth rate of the organism (42Shen B. Martin L.L. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Stout C.D. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J. La Mar G.N. Gorst C.M. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25928-25939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, much more drastic alterations in the environment of the [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster have no effect on cell growth (60Shen B. Jollie D.R. Stout C.D. Diller T.C. Armstrong F.A. Gorst C.M. La Mar G.N. Stephens P.J. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8564-8575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with these observations, the A. vinelandii strain expressing C42D FdI and the strain expressing native FdI exhibit identical lag phases and growth rates. Previous studies have also shown that mutations involving FdI [Fe-S] cluster ligands always lead to proteins that accumulate to much lower levels in vivo than does the native protein (41Gao-Sheridan H.S. Ph.D. thesis. University of California, Irvine, CA1998Google Scholar, 61Iismaa S.E. Vázquez A.E. Jensen G.M. Stephens P.J. Butt J.N. Armstrong F.A. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21563-21571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is also true for C42D FdI. Despite the low levels of accumulation of the C42D FdI in vivo, however, once the protein is purified it appears to be as stable as native FdI. What is particularly important for this study is the fact that the protein is completely stable toward oxygen. NativeAvFdI contains one [4Fe-4S]2+/+ cluster and one [3Fe-4S]+/0 cluster (49Stout C.D.

https://openalex.org/W2320784878,"We have previously isolated variant HL-60 cells that are resistant to cGMP-induced differentiation and showed that they are deficient in proteolytic cleavage and/or carboxyl methylation of Rap 1A (J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32155 - 32161, 1994 and Oncogene 17, 2211 - 2233, 1998). We have now developed an enzyme-based method for assessing Rap 1 activation which is quantitative and provides a measurement of the per cent of Rap molecules in the active GTP-bound state. Using this method, we show that cAMP and cGMP analogs activate Rap 1 in parental HL-60 cells but not in the variant cells and that H-89, a cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, has no effect on cAMP-induced Rap 1 activation in parental cells. Thus, cAMP activation of Rap 1 in HL-60 cells is likely through a cAMP-regulated guanine nucleotide exchange factor (cAMP-GEF) and since cAMP does not activate Rap 1 in the variant cells, the data suggest that full post-translational processing of Rap 1 is necessary for cAMP-GEF activation of Rap 1. Activation of Rap 1 by cGMP analogs has not been previously found and suggests possible cross-talk between the NO/cGMP signal transduction pathway and Rap 1 signaling.

GnT VI catalyzes the transfer of GlcNAc to position 4 of the Manα1,6 arm of the core structure of N-glycan, forming the most highly branched pentaantennary glycans with a bisecting GlcNAc.

In this report, we describe the molecular cloning of cDNA encoding chicken GnT VI on the basis of the partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. The similarities in the primary structures of GnT VI and IV are presented. GnT VI was purified from hen oviduct as described previously (23Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Sakamoto Y.

Approximately 2 μg of the purified GnT VI was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The band of 60 kDa was excised and treated with 0.1 μg ofAchromobacter protease I (lysylendopeptidase) (24Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim.

Masaki, Ibaraki University, Ibaraki, Japan) at 37 °C for 12 h in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 0.1% SDS and 1 mm EDTA. The peptides generated were extracted from the gel and separated on columns of DEAE-5PW (1 × 20 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and CAPCELL PAK C18 UG120 (1 × 100 mm; Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan) connected in series with a model 1100 (Hewlett Packard) liquid chromatography system. The peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 35 μl/min using a linear gradient of 0–60% solvent B in 96 min, where solvents A and B were 0.09% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, respectively. Selected peptides were subjected to Edman degradation using a model Procise 494 cLC sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry on a Reflex MALD-TOF (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear mode using 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (25Xu N.

Hen oviduct total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Based on the amino acid sequence of peptides derived from the purified GnT VI (Table I), degenerate oligonucleotides of both sense and antisense strands were synthesized with deoxyinosine substitution as indicated in Table II. These oligonucleotides served as primers for RT-PCR analysis using total RNA from hen oviduct. A reverse transcriptase reaction was performed at 42 °C for 1 h using 50 pmol of random hexamers as primer, 2 μg of total RNA, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II RT, Life Technologies, Inc.) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction mixture of the following PCR contained 2-μl aliquots of the reverse transcriptase reaction solution, 100 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1.25 units Taqpolymerase in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction mixtures were subjected to 50 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 10 s. After polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the PCR products, DNA fragments were excised and subcloned into pT7Blue vector (Novagen, WI).Table IAmino acid sequence data for selected peptides of hen oviduct GnT VIPeptideAmino acid sequenceP25RNYNDPEERVKP53GnLEWRGLEKP89KFLAVGLSSVRRPRGYYLPDTLQ-P91NPAVGSIFSIVFHQPARVTRVRVQTGS-P93FLAVGLSSVRRPRGYYLPDTLQ-The amino acid sequences are shown using the single-letter code. n indicates the one amino acid residue that could not be assigned because of assay difficulties.

Degenerate oligonucleotides were derived from the sequences of peptides P91 and P89. S indicates sense, and A indicates antisense direction. I indicates deoxyinosine. Based on the sequence of the RT-PCR products using primer sets consisting of 91S2 and 91A1 or of 89S2 and 89A1, oligonucleotides of both sense (5′-TCTCCATTGTCTTCCAC-3′, termed 91SP, or 5′-TGTCATCAGTGCGACGA-3′, termed 89SP) and antisense (5′-GTGGAAGACAATGGAGA-3′, termed 91AP, or 5′-TCGTCGCACTGATGACA-3′, termed 89AP) strands were synthesized. RT-PCR products using primer set 89SP and 91AP or primer set 91SP and 89AP were subcloned into pT7Blue vector. Total RNA was extracted from a hen oviduct as described above. Poly(A)+RNA was further purified with oligo(dT)-Latex (Oligotex-dT30(Super), Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Double stranded cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit (ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit, Stratagene). Briefly, the first cDNA strand was synthesized by reverse transcription of the poly(A)+ RNA with the primer including oligo(dT) andXhoI restriction enzyme recognition site. After synthesis of the second strand, the double stranded cDNA was ligated with anEcoRI adapter. The cDNA was then ligated toEcoRI- and XhoI-digested Uni-ZAP XR vector and subsequently packaged in vitro (Gigapack III Gold packaging extract, Stratagene). Approximately 3.9 × 105 recombinant phages were screened by plaque hybridization with a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe that had been synthesized using a digoxigenin PCR probe synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with primer sets of 89SP and 91AP. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight with a nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a hybridization buffer containing 1 ng of digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe/cm2 of membrane, 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine, and 0.02% SDS. The detection procedure was carried out with a digoxigenin luminescent detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A λ phage clone was picked up from positive plaque, and pBS-GnT VI was obtained with in vivoexcision of the pBluescript phagemid from the Uni-ZAP XR Vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. The subcloned DNAs were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method using Taq DNA polymerase (Big Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems model 377). pBS-GnT VI was digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and the inserted DNA was ligated between the EcoRI and XhoI sites of the expression vector pSVK3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (termed pSV-GnT VI). pBS-human GnT IV-homologue (pBS-hGnT IVh) (27Furukawa T. Youssef E.M. Yatsuoka T. Yokoyama T. Makino N. Inoue H. Fukushige S. Hoshi M. Hayashi Y. Sunamura M. Horii A. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was digested with XbaI and XhoI, and the inserted DNA was ligated between the XbaI and XhoI sites of pSVK3 (pSV-hGnT IVhR). Because pSV-hGnT IVhR contained an oppositely directed hGnT IVh against the SV40 promoter, it was digested withSalI and religated to obtain a clone containing an appropriate-directed hGnT IVh (pSV-hGnT IVh). COS-1 cells (1 × 106) precultured for a day in a 100-mm-diameter dish were transfected by lipofection with 2 μg of plasmid DNA, 8 μl of PLUS reagent, and 12 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 72 h, the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline and then harvested with 0.1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline using a silicon scraper. The cells were sonicated in ice and assayed for various GlcNAc transferase activities and protein concentration (BCA protein assay kit, Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. GnT III, IV, V, and VI activities were assayed as described previously (21Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Ihara Y. Sakamoto Y. Nagai K. Taniguchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 26Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochem. Biophys Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Four μg of poly(A)+RNA from hen oviduct was denatured in 50% (v/v) formamide, 17.5% (v/v) formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0) at 65 °C, electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, and then transferred to a nylon membrane (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe was synthesized using a digoxigenin PCR probe synthesis kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with 5′-ATGCGGTGCTCCCCGAA-3′ and 5′-GGTGCCTGCAGTCCAAA-3′ as primers and pBS-GnT VI as template. The membrane was hybridized with the DNA probe at 50 °C. A digoxigenin-labeled RNA molecular weight marker II (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used as a size marker. Other methods were the same as those used for the plaque hybridization. To determine a partial amino acid sequence, purified GnT VI was digested with lysylendopeptidase, and the resultant peptides were isolated on a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography column. Amino acid sequences determined for five peptides are shown in Table I. P93 was the fragment of P89 completely digested with lysylendopeptidase. Based on the amino acid sequences of P89 and P91, we synthesized degenerate oligonucleotides for sense and antisense primers (TableII). In order to reduce the primer combinations, deoxyinosine was substituted in positions where the codon degeneracy exceeded 2, and for each serine, arginine, or leucine residue, we prepared primer combinations of two codon types as shown in Table II. Oligonucleotides 91S1, 91S2, and 91A1–91A4 were synthesized on the basis of the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal sequences of P91. Eight possible pairs of sense and antisense primers were first employed in RT-PCR analysis using total RNA from hen oviduct as the template. The pair of 91S2 and 91A1 primer sets produced a cDNA fragment of 80 bp, corresponding to the length estimated from the amino acid sequence of P91. Similarly, oligonucleotides 89S1, 89S2, and 89A1–89A4 were synthesized on the basis of the peptide sequence of P89. Eight possible pairs of sense and antisense primers were used in RT-PCR analysis, and the pair of 89S2 and 89A1 primer sets produced a cDNA fragment of 71 bp, corresponding to the length estimated from the amino acid sequence of P89. When the fragments were subcloned and sequenced, the deduced amino acid sequences coincided with that of P91 and P89. Then, the sense (91SP and 89SP) and antisense (91AP and 89AP) primers based on nucleotide sequences of subcloned PCR fragments were synthesized. When we performed RT-PCR using 89SP and 91AP as a primer, a product of 850 bp was amplified. Sequencing analysis revealed that the 850-bp fragment included the sequence encoding P25, suggesting that this fragment was a part of the target gene. A λZAP hen oviduct cDNA library was screened using a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe synthesized from the 850-bp cDNA fragment described above. A positive clone was isolated from 3.9 × 105 plaques, and in vivo excision of pBluescript phagemid was carried out to yield a plasmid pBS-GnT VI. The nucleotide sequence of its cDNA insert (2.1 kilobases) was determined (Fig.1). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the cDNA consisted of 2046 nucleotides with a putative initiator codon at 219 and a TGA stop codon at 1611, having an open reading frame encoding 464 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 52,817 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence included all of the peptide residues obtained from the digest of the purified protein. Because there is only one in-frame ATG codon upstream from the sequence of the P93 peptide, which is the most upstream peptide obtained, in the open reading frame, we identified the initiation codona priori. A putative polyadenylation signal was located at nucleotide 2026 followed by poly(A) tracts. The 2065-bp cDNA length is highly consistent with the mRNA size observed in hen oviduct (Fig. 3), indicating that the cDNA is nearly full-length. The deduced amino acid sequence contained two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 1). If the enzyme protein possesses twoN-linked oligosaccharide chains, the molecular mass will agree with that of the purified protein, which is 60 kDa, observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (23Taguchi T.

A hydropathy plot analysis revealed one prominent hydrophobic segment with cationic borders in the amino-terminal region (Fig.1 B), predicting that this protein has type II transmembrane topology, as has been the case for most glycosyltransferases cloned to date. A homology search of the predicted protein revealed a significant homology with human GnT IV-homologue (27Furukawa T. Youssef E.M. Yatsuoka T. Yokoyama T. Makino N. Inoue H. Fukushige S. Hoshi M.

J. 1998; 15: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). The human GnT IV-homologue gene was identified in the region commonly deleted in pancreatic cancer, but its function is unknown (27Furukawa T. Youssef E.M. Yatsuoka T. Yokoyama T. Makino N. Inoue H. Fukushige S. Hoshi M. Hayashi Y. Sunamura M. Horii A. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). GnT VI is more closely related to human GnT IV-homologue (approximately 50% identity) than to bovine GnT IV, human GnT IVa, or human GnT IVb (25% identity) (Fig. 2). This finding prompted us to examine whether GnT IV-homologue is a human counterpart of chicken GnT VI. To confirm that the isolated cDNA clone actually encodes GnT VI and to investigate whether the human GnT IV-homologue has GnT VI activity, the cloned cDNA and human GnT IV-homologue cDNA were inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pSVK3, and overexpressed in COS-1 cells. As shown in TableIII, COS-1 cells transfected with the pSV-GnT VI showed GnT-VI activity, whereas those transfected with pSV-hGnT IVh or pSVK3 alone had no GnT-VI activity. Neither pSV-GnT VI-transfected nor pSV-hGnT-IVh-transfected cells showed GnT III and V activities (data not shown). These results indicate that the cloned cDNA encodes GnT VI, whereas the human GnT IV-homolog does not.Table IIIExpression of GnT VI and human GnT IV-homologue in COS-1 cellsTransfected plasmidGnT VI activityGnT IV activitypmol/h/mg proteinNo plasmidND 3-aND, not detected.NDMock control plasmidNDNDpSV-GnT VI26.8NDpSV-hGnT IVhNDNDGnT VI and IV activities of transfected cell homogenates.

The results are average values of three experiments. Northern blot of poly(A)+ RNA from hen oviduct was hybridized with a digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe made from the GnT VI cDNA. As shown in Fig. 3, a transcript of 2.1 kilobases was observed in hen oviduct. Because we could detect GnT VI transcripts only when we used 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from hen oviduct, the amount of GnT VI mRNA in the tissues seemed to be very small. Therefore, we examined expression of the GnT VI gene in various chicken tissues by RT-PCR analysis. To avoid artifacts during these analyses, we performed PCR toward three parts of GnT VI cDNA and compared the results. All the data consistently showed that GnT VI mRNA was relatively highly expressed in oviduct, spleen, lung, and colon. We have cloned a cDNA that encodes chicken GnT VI. Several lines of evidence indicate that the cloned cDNA corresponds to the GnT-VI previously purified from hen oviduct (23Taguchi T. Ogawa T. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Sakamoto Y. Korekane H. Taniguchi N. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 32598-32602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar): (a) the predicted sequence of the protein contains all five peptides obtained from the purified enzyme protein; (b) when the cDNA was introduced into a eukaryotic expression vector and transfected into COS-1 cells, the enzyme activity was highly expressed; and (c) the characteristics of the predicted protein are consistent with those of the purified protein in terms of molecular mass and membrane localization. Among N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases acting on the branch formation of the N-glycan core structure, GnTs I–V have been already cloned (4Kumar R. Yang J. Larsen R.D. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad.

No homologies have been found in primary structures of those GnTs except that GnT IV has isoenzymes (28Yoshida A. Minowa M.T. Hara T. Takamatsu S. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that GnT VI has a significant sequence similarity to human GnT IV-homologue (hGnT IVh) (27Furukawa T. Youssef E.M. Yatsuoka T. Yokoyama T. Makino N. Inoue H. Fukushige S. Hoshi M. Hayashi Y. Sunamura M. Horii A. J. Hum.

Because it has not been determined whether hGnT IVh is a functional GlcNAc transferase (27Furukawa T. Youssef E.M. Yatsuoka T. Yokoyama T. Makino N. Inoue H. Fukushige S. Hoshi M. Hayashi Y. Sunamura M. Horii A. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 44: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we overexpressed hGnT IVh cDNA in COS-1 cells and measured various GlcNAc transferase activities. Recombinant hGnT IVh showed neither GnT IV nor GnT VI activity. In addition, hGnT IVh had no GnT III and GnT V activity, and its function remains unknown. It appears reasonable that GnT IV and VI have a similarity in primary structure, because both generate a β1,4-linked GlcNAc on a Man residue. Because the recombinant GnT VI had no GnT IV activity (present study) and GnT IV had no GnT VI activity (28Yoshida A. Minowa M.T. Hara T. Takamatsu S. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. Glycoconj. J. 1998; 15: 1115-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the nonhomologous domains could be important for the recognition of acceptor structures. In any event, we have detected a diverged β-4 GlcNAc transferase family. It is interesting to determine whether there are other such members. It is also of interest that only GnT III has a unique evolutionary origin among Man β-4 GlcNAc transferases. The GnT VI gene was relatively highly expressed in hen oviduct, spleen, lung, and colon. GnT VI activity in chicken tissues was, however, reported to be high in hen oviduct, low but significant in liver and colon, and absent in heart and spleen (20Brockhausen I. Hull E. Hindsgaul O. Schachter H. Shah R.N. Michnick S.W. Carver J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11211-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the reason for the discrepancy between the amount of mRNA and enzymatic activity is unknown, translational regulation and posttranslational modification may be responsible. Pentaantennary N-glycans have not as yet been found in mammalian tissues. This is consistent with the lack of GnT VI activity in several mammal species (20Brockhausen I. Hull E. Hindsgaul O. Schachter H. Shah R.N. Michnick S.W. Carver J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11211-11221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether such pentaantennary structures are really absent in mammals, more sensitive and specific assay methods (e.g. immunochemical ones) should be developed. Studies on the presence of a GnT VI gene and its expression in mammals could prove useful. Multiantennary structures generated by GnT IV and GnT V have been associated with phenotypic changes in malignant transformation (29Dennis J.W. Granovsky M. Warren C.E. Biochim. Biophys.

Bulky multiantennaryN-linked glycan chains are also thought to be involved in communication between cells in conditions relating to fertility (31Kitajima K. Inoue S. Inoue Y. Dev.

https://openalex.org/W1982264972,"Using a peptide toxin, kaliotoxin (KTX), we gained new insight into the topology of the pore region of a voltage-gated potassium channel, mKv1.1. In order to find new interactions between mKv1.1 and KTX, we investigated the pH dependence of KTX block which was stronger at pHo 6.2 compared with pHo 7.4. Using site-directed mutagenesis on the channel and the toxin, we found that protonation of His34in KTX caused the pHo dependence of KTX block. Glu350 and Glu353 in mKv1.1, which interact with His34 in KTX, were calculated to be 4 and 7 Å away from His34/KTX, respectively. Docking of KTX into a homology model of mKv1.1 based on theKcsA crystal structure using this and other known interactions as constraints showed structural differences betweenmKv1.1 and KcsA within the turret (amino acids 348–357). To satisfy our data, we would have to modify theKcsA crystal structure for the mKv1.1 channel orienting Glu350 7 Å and Glu353 4 Å more toward the center of the pore compared with KcsA. This would place Glu350 15 Å and Glu353 11 Å away from the center of the pore instead of the distances for the equivalentKcsA residues with 22 Å for Gly53 and 15 Å for Gly56, respectively. Bacterial and mammalian potassium channels may have structural differences regarding the turret of the outer pore vestibule.

Estimations of the topology of the external vestibule of various potassium channels were successful because the structure of the peptide toxins, which was structurally defined by NMR studies, reports the complementary shape of the binding partner (5Stocker M.

Therefore, up to the availability of x-ray data for each potassium channel, further application of peptide toxins as molecular calipers to investigate the architecture of structurally non-defined targets appears to be reasonable.Several toxins display a blocking affinity dependent on the extracellular pH (pHo) but until now only a decreased block at acid pHo was known; both with peptide toxins (9Aiyar J.

Grissmer S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2351-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) at low pHo was caused by protonation of histidine residues within the outer vestibule of the respective channel proteins. Affinity of tityustoxin to the squid Kv1 channel SqKv1A, which contains a histidine at Shaker position 425, is also reduced at acid pHo (14Dudlak C.S. Jerng H.H. Gilly W.F. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 97AGoogle Scholar). In contrast, in mKv1.1 and H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels, we observed a better KTX block at low pHo. In this paper we present evidence that protonation of a histidine in KTX, which interacts with negatively charged amino acids in the outer pore region of mKv1.1 and H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels, is responsible for the higher KTX affinity of these channels. Using electrostatic compliance we found distances of 4 and 7 Å between Glu353 and Glu350 in mKv1.1 and His34 in KTX, respectively. Our data define the position of the turret (amino acids 348–357) in Kv1.1 and also Kv1.3 and imply structural differences between mammalian and bacterial K+ channels in that region. These results help refine our picture of the spatial arrangement of amino acid residues in the outer pore region of Kv1.1 and Kv1.3 that might facilitate therapeutic drug design.RESULTSTo initially characterize the effect of extracellularly applied KTX on current through mKv1.1 channels, we measured whole cell currents in response to depolarizing steps from −80 to +40 mV in the absence and presence of KTX (Fig. 1 A, left). 60 nm KTX (Bachem) added to the external mammalian Ringer solution resulted in a peak current reduction of about 50%. To quantify the KTX affinity of mKv1.1, we measured, in additional experiments, the effect of different KTX concentrations on current through mKv1.1 channels and plotted the normalized peak currents against the applied KTX concentration (Fig. 1 B, open triangles). A Hill equation was fitted to the data with a Hill coefficient of 1, indicating a 1:1 stoichiometry suggesting that one KTX molecule is sufficient to block one mKv1.1 channel. The fit gave a dissociation constantKd at pHo 7.4 of 62 nm (n = 25), which is in agreement with earlier reports (22Grissmer S. Nguyen A.N. Aiyar J. Hanson D.C. Mather R.J. Gutman G.A. Karmilowicz M.J. Auperin D.D. Chandy K.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 1227-1234PubMed Google Scholar). The current reduction by KTX was fully reversible upon washout (data not shown). Application of 60 nm KTX (Bachem) to the bath solution at pHo 6.2 reduced the current much more than 50% (Fig. 1 A, right). The determination of the KTX affinity of mKv1.1 at pHo 6.2 was made as for pHo 7.4 and showed a Kd of 19 nm (n = 28). Fig. 1 B clearly demonstrates that the dose-response curve for KTX at pHo 6.2 (open squares) to block currents through mKv1.1 channels was shifted toward lower concentrations. Therefore, lowering pHofrom 7.4 to 6.2 increased the KTX affinity to mKv1.1 ∼ 3.3 times. The same relationship between KdpHo 7.4 and 6.2 was revealed with the recombinantly made KTX which exhibited an ∼4 times higher affinity tomKv1.1 channels compared with KTX from Bachem (TableI) probably because of higher purity of the recombinant KTX.Table IKd values (in nm) of the tested channels and channel mutants with the analyzed peptide toxins and peptide toxin mutants at pHo 7.4 and 6.2Kd at pHo7.4Kd at pHo6.2Kd at pHo7.4/ Kd at pHo 6.2nmnmKv1.1 KTX 1-aKTX from Bachem.62193.3 KTX 1-bRecombinant KTX.10.6 ± 23.3 ± 0.53.3D361N Kv1.1 KTX 1-aKTX from Bachem.272 ± 6782 ± 123.6E353S Kv1.1 KTX 1-aKTX from Bachem.94 ± 3340 ± 122.4H404T Kv1.3 KTX 1-aKTX from Bachem.0.240.102.4 KTX 1-bRecombinant KTX.0.059 ± 0.0060.025 ± 0.0042.3 CTX0.250.251 NTX 5.4 7.70.7 KTX30.15 ± 0.0150.17 ± 0.0250.9 KTX-H34A0.097 ± 0.0080.096 ± 0.0191.0 KTX-H34K0.017 ± 0.0030.016 ± 0.0061.06 KTX-R31A/H34A0.98 ± 0.11.07 ± 0.10.91 KTX-K32A0.24 ± 0.040.11 ± 0.032.2 KTX-K27Dap5.4 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.043.8 KTX-K27Dab5.6 ± 0.33.2 ± 0.31.8 KTX-K27ThLys0.19 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.012.3 KTX-K27Nle42162.7 KTX-K27A79 ± 433.7 ± 2.52.4D375A/D376A/H404T Kv1.3 KTX 1-bRecombinant KTX.0.111 ± 0.010.102 ± 0.011.1D375A/H404T Kv1.3 KTX 1-bRecombinant KTX.0.059 ± 0.0060.056 ± 0.0051.05D376A/H404T Kv1.3 KTX 1-bRecombinant KTX.0.094 ± 0.0120.040 ± 0.0082.4S378E/H404T Kv1.3 KTX 1-bRecombinant KTX.0.057 ± 0.0030.016 ± 0.0023.5P377A/S378E/H404T Kv1.3 KTX 1-bRecombinant KTX.0.064 ± 0.0060.019 ± 0.0023.4Kd values without S.E. were revealed by fitting (by eye) a Hill equation to data points for different toxin concentrations, whereas each data point represented the mean ± S.E. of at least four experiments.

Open table in a new tab We wanted to know whether this observed higher KTX affinity ofmKv1.1 at low pHo is caused by protonation of an amino acid in the channel protein or by protonation of a residue in KTX. To rule out effects of His355 of themKv1.1 channel (protonation of His355 results in a decrease of the TEA affinity at low pHo (see Ref. 12Bretschneider F. Wrisch A. Lehmann-Horn F. Grissmer S. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2351-2360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)), we tested KTX on mKv1.1 mutant channels with a non-protonatable glycine instead of a histidine at position 355 (H355G/mKv1.1). KTX, however, seemed to bind to this H355G mutant mKv1.1 channel in an irreversible manner since currents could not be recovered after application of KTX even after wash-out for more than 1 h (data not shown). To avoid possible problems with rundown versus block, we tested KTX on H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels. The H404T/mKv1.3 channel also contains no protonatable histidine in the outer pore region (Fig. 2 A). Instead of the histidine, it has a glycine at the corresponding position 380; the histidine residue of the wt mKv1.3 channel at position 404 (equivalent to position 379 of mKv1.1) is changed to a threonine in this mutant of the channel (Fig. 2 A). We did identical experiments with KTX from Bachem for H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels as we did for mKv1.1 channels. KTX displayed an increased affinity to H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels at low pHo despite the absence of protonatable histidines in the outer pore region. The dose-response curve for pHo 6.2 was shifted toward lower concentrations compared with pHo 7.4 (Fig. 1 C) and revealed Kd values of 0.24 nm(n = 28) and 0.10 nm (n = 28) for pHo 7.4 and 6.2, respectively.Figure 2Alignment of channels and toxins.

Crest et al. (23Crest M. Jacquet G. Gola M. Zerrouk H. Benslimane A. Rochat H. Mansuelle P. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1640-1647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Mourre et al. (24Mourre C. Chernova M.N. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Bessone R. Jacquet G. Gola M. Alper S.L. Crest M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the KTX block of calcium-dependent potassium channels with large conductance (MaxiK channels) and of voltage-dependent potassium channels is voltage-independent at physiological pHo, but there were no studies testing a possible voltage dependence of KTX block at acid pHo. To create a conductance-voltage relationship of the KTX block, we converted the currents shown in Fig. 3 (A and C) to conductances by dividing the peak currents through the driving force for [K+] (E − EK). At pHo 7.4 application of 50 pmrecombinant KTX reduced maximum conductance to 68% of the values obtained in the absence of KTX without changing activation of the channels. The suppression of the conductance was identical at membrane potentials more positive than 0 mV up to +100 mV, indicating that the KTX block on H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels was voltage-independent in that potential range at physiological pHo. At pHo 6.2, application of 50 pm recombinant KTX reduced maximum conductance gK(max) significantly higher compared with pHo 7.4 to only 40% of the control value. The KTX block was again voltage-independent; membrane potentials more positive than +20 mV did not modify the blocking strength of KTX (Fig. 3 D). Since the KTX effect seemed to be independent of the applied voltage for depolarizations between 0 and +100 mV at both pHo values, it seemed sufficient for later experiments to evaluate the KTX block at one potential, in our case +40 mV, using the ratios of the peak currents (see also Fig. 1 C). In comparison to the voltage independence of KTX block on current through H404T/mKv1.3 shown here, CTX block of Ca2+-activated K+ channels (25MacKinnon R. Miller C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 335-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and of voltage-dependent Shaker K+ channels (26Goldstein S.A. Miller C. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1613-1619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) was reported to be slightly voltage-dependent. Both Figs. 1 C and 3 demonstrate that KTX block on current through H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels was better at low pHo with a ratio of 237 KdpHo 7.4/KdpHo 6.2 253 of 2.4 but to a lesser extent compared with mKv1.1 channels with a ratio of 3.3 (Table I). This difference might be explained by distinct amino acids in the outer pore region of mKv1.1 and mKv1.3 channels (for details see below). The existence of a pHo-dependent KTX block of H404T/mKv1.3 channels lacking histidine residues in the pore region indicated that protonation of an amino acid in KTX might be responsible for the higher affinity at low pHo. In all tested channels recombinant KTX blocked current more efficiently compared with KTX from Bachem (Table I). However, both batches of peptide toxins exhibited a similar pHodependence of block with an improvement of the KTX affinity to H404T mutant mKv1.3 of ∼2.4 times with changing pHo from 7.4 to 6.2 (Table I).Figure 3Voltage dependence of KTX block on current through H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels at pHo 7.4 and 6.2.

B, corresponding conductances for the currents shown inA are plotted against the applied membrane potential, in the absence (▵) and in the presence (▴) of KTX. The lines through the points were fitted by a Boltzmann equation:gK(E) =gK(max)/{1 + exp[(E1/2− E)/k]} with values forgK(max) of 24 and 16 nS without and with KTX, respectively.

D, corresponding conductance-voltage relations for the currents shown inC, in the absence (■) and in the presence (▪) of KTX.

Values for k (6 mV) andE1/2 (−10 mV) were also confirmed by additional experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To find out further indications for our hypothesis that protonation of an amino acid in KTX is responsible for the higher affinity at pHo 6.2, we investigated the pHo dependence of block by other peptide toxins like CTX and NTX on current through the H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels. CTX blocked the current through H404T/mKv1.3 with equal strength at pHo 7.4 as well as at pHo 6.2, which can be seen by the identicalKd values shown in Table I for pHo 7.4 (0.25 nm; n= 28) and pHo 6.2 (0.25 nm;n = 22. In addition, H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels showed a slight but opposite pHodependence of NTX block with Kd values of 5.4 nm (n = 24) and 7.7 nm(n = 20) at pHo 7.4 and 6.2, respectively (Table I). We therefore concluded that the increase in affinity by lowering pHo is specific for KTX since CTX and NTX did not show this behavior.By comparing the amino acid sequence of the toxins, we found that KTX possesses a unique histidine at position 34 not present in CTX and NTX (Fig. 2 B). In order to find out whether His34might be the protonatable amino acid in KTX, we used KTX3which has an Asp at position 34 whose protonation should not vary between pHo 7.4 and 6.2. KTX3exhibited nearly the same affinity to H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels at pHo 7.4 and 6.2 withKd values of 150 ± 15 pm(n = 6) and 170 ± 25 pm(n = 6) at pHo 7.4 and 6.2, respectively (Table I). The loss of the pHo-dependent KTX effect in KTX3 indicated that His34 of KTX might be responsible for this effect because of the lack of a histidine residue at position 34 in KTX3.Additional experiments with KTX-Lys27 mutants on H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels were made to exclude Lys27 of KTX as the protonatable amino acid of KTX. The KTX mutants K27Dap, K27Dab, and K27ThLys contained non-natural positively charged lysine analogs of varying side chain lengths (Dap, 2.5 Å from Cα; Dab, 3.8 Å; ThLys, 7.7 Å; natural lysine, 6.3 Å), whereas in K27A and K27Nle the neutral alanine and the non-natural neutral norleucine replaced lysine (6Aiyar J. Rizzi J.P. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31013-31016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M. Dethlefs B. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). If Lys27 was somehow involved in the pHo dependence of KTX block, we would expect a pHo-independent block with the non-charged amino acids at position 27 and perhaps an altered pHo dependence with the shorter and longer non-natural lysine analogs Dap, Dab, and ThLys. Table I shows that all KTX-Lys27 mutants bound in a pHo-dependent manner to H404T mutantmKv1.3 channels with a higher affinity at low pHo, revealing that Lys27 is not responsible for pHo dependence of KTX block.To further substantiate that protonation of His34 in KTX is responsible for the pHo dependence of KTX block on current through mKv1.1 and H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels, we made mutants of this peptide toxin by recombinant methods (17Garcia M.L. Hanner M. Knaus H.G. Slaughter R. Kaczorowski G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294 (624–639): 624-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). His34 of KTX seemed to be a good candidate for the protonatable amino acid in KTX, as indicated by the investigations with H404T/mKv1.1 channels and CTX, NTX, and KTX3. Therefore, we investigated the KTX mutants H34A and H34K. In addition, we also replaced Arg31 and Lys32 in KTX with neutral amino acids to examine whether these two positions in KTX were also involved since earlier work indicated that these two positions participate in important interactions (9Aiyar J. Withka J.M. Rizzi J.P. Singleton D.H. Andrews G.C. Lin W. Boyd J. Hanson D.C. Simon M. Dethlefs B. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1169-1181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 27Gairi M. Romi R. Fernandez I. Rochat H. Martin-Eauclaire M.F. Van R.J. Pons M. Giralt E. J. Pept. Sci. 1997; 3: 314-319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested the pHo dependence of block of all four KTX mutants with H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels (Table I). The KTX mutant K32A still had a weaker blocking effect at pHo7.4 compared with pHo 6.2 by a factor of about 2.1 on H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels, suggesting that Lys32 in KTX did not cause the pHodependence of block (Table I). In contrast, KTX-H34A blocked H404T mutant mKv1.3 with the same potency at pHo 7.4 and 6.2 (Fig. 4 A (top) and TableI). Additional replacement of Arg31 with alanine in the H34A/R31A mutant KTX exhibited no further effect (Table I). Replacement of His34 in KTX by lysine led to the same effect as substitution by alanine concerning the pHo-independent block but exhibited a higher affinity to H404T/mKv1.3 than H34A and wt KTX (Fig. 4 A (bottom) and Table I). Therefore H34A, H34K, and R31A/H34A mutants of KTX blocked currents through H404T mutantmKv1.3 channels in a pHo-independent manner, whereas KTX-K32A block is influenced by pHo. These results suggest that only the histidine residue at position 34 of KTX is the protonatable amino acid of KTX that causes pHo dependence of block while Arg31 and Lys32 of KTX do not seem to play a role in this effect.Figure 4pHo dependence of block of recombinant wt KTX and the KTX mutants H34A and H34K on current through H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels. A, pHo-independent block of KTX mutants H34A (top) and H34K (bottom). Currents were elicited as described in the legend to Fig. 1 A. B, MeanKd values and standard deviations of wt KTX (■), KTX-H34A (▴), and KTX-H34K (●) block of current through H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels were plotted against the pHo. Kd values were obtained as described in the legend to Fig. 1 A. The curve through the wt KTX data points represents a fit with the equationKd = Kd(max) + {[Kd(max) −Kd(min)]/[1 + (10pHo /10pKa )h ]} with Kd(max) of 60 pm,Kd(min) of 18 pm, pKa of 6.5, and a Hill coefficient, h, of 1.7. The applied wt KTX was made recombinantly. Straight lines through data points for KTX-H34A and KTX-H34K represent linear regressions with slopes of zero.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If protonation of His34 in KTX is the reason for the better block of mKv1.1 and H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels with lowering pHo, H34A and H34K mutants of KTX should (a) have a pHo-independent block as shown before (Fig. 4 A and Table I) and (b) represent the fully protonated (H34K) and the fully unprotonated (H34A) form of wt KTX responsible for the pHo dependence of block. Fig. 4 Bshows the titration of wt KTX and the mutants H34K and H34A from pHo 5.5 to pHo 7.8 examined on H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels. KTX-H34K exhibited the same Kd of ∼16 pm in the investigated pHo range, and KTX-H34A had identical Kd values of ∼100 pm at 6 different pHo values between pHo 5.5 and 7.4. Linear regressions through the data points of both KTX mutants had slopes of zero, indicating that these KTX mutants cannot be titrated in the pHorange used. This also suggests that histidine at position 34 of KTX is protonatable. The affinity of wt KTX to H404T mutant mKv1.3 channels decreased with increasing pHo. The fit through the data points using the Hill equation gave aKd(min) of 18 pm at pHo 5.5 and a Kd(max) of 60 pm at pHo 7.8 and a pKa of 6.5, which represents the pH of the half-maximum protonation. The Hill coefficient of 1.7 suggests that more than one negatively charged amino acids of the channel protein could sense His34 of KTX. TheKd(min) of 18 pm wt KTX at pHo 5.5 is the expected value with good agreement with the Kd of KTX-H34K, which stands for the fully protonated form of wt KTX. In contrast, KTX-H34A, which represents the unprotonated wt KTX, had a lower affinity to H404T/mKv1.3 channels with 100 pm compared withKd(max) of wt KTX with 60 pm at pHo 7.8. The reason for this difference might be a non-ionic interaction between the unprotonated His34 of wt KTX and an amino acid of the channel that is abolished by the substitution with alanine. A more conservative replacement with glutamine or asparagine might solve this question (28Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7401-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 29Rehwald M. Neuschafer-Rube F. de Vries C. Püschel G.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since the data confirmed our predictions apart from this difference betweenKd(max) of wt KTX and Kd of KTX-H34A, we concluded that indeed protonation of His34 in KTX caused the pHo dependence of block.To determine which amino acid(s) of the channel protein interacted with the protonatable His34 of KTX, we tested some mutants of the mKv1.1 and the H404T/mKv1.3 channels, respectively. Six negatively charged residues in the mKv1.1 pore region could be candidates for the interaction with His34 in KTX: Glu348, Glu350, Glu351, Glu343, Asp361, and Asp377 (Fig. 2 A). The mKv1.3 channel contains all of these negatively charged amino acids except one at position 378, which corresponds to position 353 of mKv1.1 with an uncharged serine instead of the glutamate in mKv1.1. We did not investigate the Asp377 of mKv1.1 (Asp402 in mKv1.3) of the GYGD motif, since we had found that the shorter lysine analogs Dap and Dab at position 27 of KTX that were shown to interact with Asp402 inmKv1.3 (6Aiyar J. Rizzi J.P. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31013-31016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) still blocked in a pHo-dependent manner (Table I). In addition, from the KcsA crystal structure data, we concluded that the negative charges at positions 348–353 of mKv1.1 would be the best candidates for the interacting amino acids. We expected that replacing negatively charged amino acids in the channel that interact with His34 with neutral residues would diminish or abolish pHo-dependent KTX block, depending on whether the negatively charged residue alone or together with others could sense His34 in KTX. As a starting point, we investigated"

The reason for the underestimation has been attributed to the cycling of triose phosphate and glycerol and the lack of complete equilibrium between GAP and DHAP leading to asymmetric isotope incorporation as well as zonation of gluconeogenic enzymes and a [13C]glycerol gradient across the liver during gluconeogenesis. How these different factors may affect the precision and accuracy of the MIDA approach in the estimation of gluconeogenesis has not been demonstrated (1Neese R.A. Schwarz J.M. Faix D. Turner S.

When rat liver was perfused after a 2-day fast with [U-13C]glycerol, M1 and M2 glucose mass isotopomers were found in addition to the M3 and M6 of glucose predicted on the basis of the combination of two m3 triose-P molecules. Since M1 and M2 isotopomers were also seen in triose-P and in phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (4Previs S.F. Fernandez C.A. Yang D. Soloviev M.V. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19806-19815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), the source of M1 and M2 isotopomers of glucose was assumed to come from the loss of carbon via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Since glyceraldehyde phosphate is also an intermediate of the pentose cycle, the cycling of glycerol carbons through the pentose cycle pathways produces asymmetry in glucose carbon labeling pattern and can also lead to the formation of M1 and M2 glucose. We present here a study of the role of the pentose cycle in gluconeogenesis in Fao cells, in which the cycling of [U-13C]glycerol carbon between glycerol and PEP was minimized with the dilution of PEP from unlabeled gluconeogenic precursors, pyruvate and glutamine. Fao hepatoma cells are derived from the Reuber H35 rat hepatoma cell line (6Crettaz M. Kahn C.R. Endocrinology. 1983; 113: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Moore E.E. Weiss M.C.

Physiol. 1982; 111: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and show stable expression of a number of liver-specific functions including the expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes PEP carboxykinase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. Since Fao cells can grow in glucose-free media and have a uniform enzymatic profile, unlike the mixture of periportal and perivenous cells seen in primary hepatocyte culture, Fao cells were used to study gluconeogenesis. In addition, Fao cells have been found to have specific and high affinity binding of insulin at physiologic concentrations. The metabolic regulation of glucose release and gluconeogenesis by insulin was also studied. The Fao hepatoma cell line was obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC). [1,2,3-13C3]Glycerol or [U-13C3]glycerol (>99% enriched) was purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, OH). The Fao cells were serum-starved for 18 h in low glucose (1 g/liter) DMEM, containing an additional 1 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin before the isotope study. The medium was then changed to DMEM with no glucose, which contains sodium pyruvate, 1 mm glutamine (2 mm final), and penicillin/streptomycin as in the low glucose condition. Dexamethasone was then added to a final concentration of 10−6m, and the final concentration of the ETOH carrier for dexamethasone was 0.02%. Two substrate conditions (2 mm xylitol or 12.5 mmglucose) and two hormone conditions (in the presence or absence of insulin) were used giving rise to four incubation conditions. Undiluted [U-13C]glycerol was added to all culture plates to a final [U-13C]glycerol of 1.5 mm to start the experiment. For incubation with insulin, the cells were stimulated with dexamethasone for 2 h before the addition of insulin. The final concentration of insulin was 10−8m. The plates were incubated for a total of 24 h after the time the media were collected. At the end of experiment, cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, spun down, resuspended in a total volume of 50 μl with phosphate-buffered saline, and stored at −80 °C until processed. This pellet was sonicated prior to measurement of glycogen or ribose. Glycogen glucose was isolated from cell pellets after treatment with amyloglucosidase (8Katz J. Lee W-N.P. Wals P. Bergner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12994-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from cell pellet after treatment with ice-cold Trizol 1:2%, v/v (9Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar, 10Chomczynski P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 532-536PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation medium from each culture plate was analyzed for lactate, glucose, and glutamate using previously established methods. Lactate was first extracted from the acidified medium using ethyl acetate. Glucose, glutamine, and glutamate were separated using ion-exchange chromatography. (8Katz J. Lee W-N.P. Wals P. Bergner E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12994-13004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) Glucose and xylitol were co-eluted in the neutral fraction from the medium. Medium or glycogen glucose was derivatized as its penta-acetate or aldonitrile penta-acetate derivative for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (11Szafranek J. Pfaffenberger D.C. Horning E.C. Carbohydr. Res. 1974; 38: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Under either derivatization condition, xylitol was converted to its acetate derivative by the acetic anhydride reaction. GC conditions were as follows: capillary column (HP5); carrier gas, helium at flow rate of 1 ml/min, initial oven temperature 220 °C for 2 min and a temperature gradient of 10 °C per min until final temperature of 250 °C, xylitol penta-acetate and glucose aldonitrile penta-acetate were separated. Chemical ionization (CI) was used to give the molecular ion (C-1—C-6) of the glucose molecule at m/z331 for its penta-acetate and m/z 328 for its aldonitrile penta-acetate. Electron impact ionization (EI) of the aldonitrile derivative was used to characterize glucose positional isotopomers atm/z 187 for C-3—C-6 and m/z 242 for C-1—C-4 fragments. Ribose was converted to its aldonitrile acetate derivative and lactate to its heptafluorobutyrate n-propylamide derivative as described previously (12Tserng K.Y. Gilfillan C.A. Kalhan S.C. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Results of the mass isotopomers in glucose or lactate are reported as molar fractions of m0, m1, m2, etc., according to the number of labeled carbons in the molecule (13Lee W-N.P. Edmond J. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Biol. Mass Spectrom. 1990; 20: 451-458Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The sum of all isotopomers of the molecules, Σm i for I = 1 to n(n = 3, 5, or 6 for lactate, ribose, and glucose, respectively), equal to 1 or 100%. The labeled isotopomer fractions are also reported as m i/Σm i, in percent, which is a distribution not affected by the dilution with unlabeled compounds. The enrichment, Σmn, is the weighted sum of the labeled species (Σmn = m1 × 1 + m2 × 2 + m3 × 3 … ). The relative molar enrichment equals enrichment in the product, Σmn, divided by the enrichment in the infused precursor, (= m1·1 + m2·2 + m3·3 = average 13C/molecule) = 3 for [1,2,3-13C3]glycerol. The relative enrichment is equivalent to relative molar specific activity, the ratio of13C activity in a product to the 13C specific activity of the infused glycerol. Glucose has been considered to be a dimer resulting from the condensation of GAP and DHAP molecules. When the rate of formation of glucose is much slower than the rate of isomerization of these triose-P molecules, the labeling pattern of the top half (C-1—C-3) of the glucose molecule is expected to be the same as that of the bottom half (C-4—C-6). Asymmetry in the glucose labeling pattern can result when the two triose-P molecules are produced or removed at unequal rates as demonstrated by Previs et al. (4Previs S.F. Fernandez C.A. Yang D. Soloviev M.V. David F. Brunengraber H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19806-19815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Asymmetry of labeling of the top and bottom half of the glucose molecule can occur through the loss of [13C]carbon via the pentose cycle. An account of the fate of [1,2,3-13C3]glucose-6-P carbon going through the pentose cycle is provided in Fig.1. [1,2,3-13C3]glucose (M3 top) can be oxidized by the reaction of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) resulting in [1,2-13C2]pentose-5-P (either ribose-5-P or xylulose-5-P). The action of transketolase on xylulose-5-P and ribose-5-P leads to the formation of [1,2,3,4-13C4]-, [1,2-13C2]-, and [3,4-13C2]sedoheptulose-7-P. Subsequently, due to the action of transaldolase, [1,2,3-13C3]-, [1,2-13C2]-, and [3-13C]fructose-6-P, and [1-13C]erythrose-4-P and unlabeled erythrose-4-P are formed. M3 glucose can rapidly become M1 and M2 glucose. The action of the pentose cycle leads to the formation of M2 and M1 glucose at the expense of M3 label in the C-1—C-3 position. As shown in Fig. 1, the bottom three carbons, on the other hand, cycle via the transketolase and transaldolase reactions without being changed. Thus [4,5,6-13C3]glucose (M3 bottom) is expected to remain as M3. As a result, M3 bottom (C-4—C-6) is always greater than M3 top (C-1—C-3), and the opposite is true for M2 and M1. Asymmetry in glucose labeling pattern can be demonstrated by comparing the distribution of isotopomers of the C-1—C-4 fragment (by EI) to that of the C-1—C-6 fragment (by CI) as illustrated in Fig.2. As shown in Fig. 2, if only the sole action of the pentose cycle is considered, a loss in the M3 isotopomers by EI, due to cleaving off carbons 5 and 6 of glucose, results in a gain of M1. However, some randomization of top and bottom of the glucose molecule does occur, secondary to the action of aldolase on fructose-1,6-P, in which case proportionate amount of M3 and M2 should be lost, if the label in M3, M2, and M1 glucose is symmetrically distributed (see “Results”). In order to minimize the effect of the tricarboxylic acid cycle on the final isotopomer distribution in glucose and ribose, unlabeled gluconeogenic precursors, pyruvate and glutamine, were added to the incubation media to a final concentration of 1 mm. This had the effect of diluting any13C label coming from the randomization of the13C label through tricarboxylic acid cycle. Under such conditions, mass isotopomer distribution in lactate is the result of conversion of glycerol to lactate diluted by unlabeled lactate from other sources. Table I shows that lactate produced from glycerol by cultured Fao cells is greatly diluted by lactate produced from pyruvate or glutamate. This observation suggests that very little 13C-labeled glycerol went into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and this was also supported by the fact that 13C isotopomer of glutamate was not detectable in medium glutamate (data not shown). Therefore our experimental conditions allowed us to focus on the interactions of glycolytic/gluconeogenic, glycogen, and pentose phosphate pathways in this Fao model.Table VIIEquilibrium distribution of mass isotopomers in fructose 6-phosphate by the action of transketolase and transaldolaseSedoheptulose-7-P + glyceraldehyde-3PMolar fractionXylulose-5-P + erythrose-4-PMolar fractionm3tm3b (m6)0.125m2tm4b (m6)0.125m2tm3b (m5)0.125m2tm3b (m5)0.125m1tm3b (m1)0.125m0tm4b (m4)0.125m0tm3b (m3)0.125m0tm3b (m3)0.125m3tm0b (m3)0.125m2tm1b (m3)0.125m2tm0b (m2)0.125m2tm0b (m2)0.125m1tm0b (m1)0.125m0tm1b (m1)0.125m0tm0b (m0)0.125m0tm0b (m0)0.125The molar fraction is calculated using results in Table VI. m3b and m0b refer to enrichment of glyceraldehyde-3-P, and m2t and m0t are from xylulose-5-P (Table V).

[13C]Carbon atoms are indicated by *C, and thesubscript numbers indicate the original carbon positions in the glucose molecule. The fate of individual glucose carbon in different pentose cycle intermediates is shown. Glucose oxidation by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase results in the loss of C1 and the formation of pentose phosphate with two [13C]carbons. Subsequent action of the pentose cycle enzymes transketolase and transaldolase results in four isotopomers of sedoheptulose-7-P and four isotopomers of fructose-6-P, which become [1,2,3-13C3]-, [1,2-13C2]-, and [3-13C]glucose (M3, M2, and M1). Reaction of erythrose-4-P with xylulose-5-P (not shown) can similarly result in the same M3, M2, and M1 glucose. By following the subscript numbers, it is clear that unlike [1,2,3-13C3]glucose, [4,5,6-13C3]glucose is recycled as [4,5,6-13C3]glucose, and no M2 and M1 glucose are generated from it. Thus, the action of the PPP on a mixture of equal amount of [1,2,3-13C3]glucose and [4,5,6-13C3]glucose results in a decrease in molar enrichment of [1,2,3-13C3]glucose without changing the enrichment of [4,5,6-13C3]glucose as shown in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Total ion chromatogram of xylitol and glucose in the incubation media.

Diminution of the glucose peak where insulin is present indicates inhibition of gluconeogenesis by insulin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IMass isotopomer distribution in media lactate:m0m1m2m3ΣmnNo insulinAve ±0.9680.0030.0050.0240.085S.D.0.0020.0010.0010.0020.005InsulinAve ±0.9540.0080.0070.0300.112S.D.0.0060.0010.0010.0030.0142 mm xylitol and 1.5 mm[U13C]glycerol with no cold glucose added.

Molar fraction of each isotopomer is given by the respective combinatorial probability. For example, [U-13C7]sedoheptulose is derived from combining 1,2-13C2 moiety from [U-13C7]- and [1,2-13C2] sedoheptulose with [U-13C5]ribose-5-P, which is 0.5 × 0.25 = 0.125 using values from Table V. In this and subsequent tables, x and o represent 13C and12C, respectively. The two m3 mass isotopomers are designated as m3 top (m3t) and m3 bottom (m3b) depending on whether the13C is in C-1–C-3 or C-4–C-6. The t and b are used in combination with m1, m2, and m3 throughout to designate the corresponding carbon position of the label in glucose. Please note, the mass isotopomer distribution is that from 100% GNG. 2 mm xylitol and 1.5 mm[U13C]glycerol with no cold glucose added. Average (Ave.) and S.D. of triplicates are provided. The release of glucose into the medium was quantitated using the medium xylitol as a recovery standard. Xylitol is co-isolated with glucose and is converted to penta-acetate during the derivatization of glucose. The derivative of xylitol shares a common C-3—C-6 fragment (at m/z 187) with the glucose aldonitrile penta-acetate derivative but has a different retention time than that of the glucose derivative (Fig.3). The inhibition of glucose release into the medium by insulin is clearly demonstrated by the reduction of the glucose peak. The inhibition can be quantitated by examining the GC ratio of glucose to that of xylitol using a standard curve. Results are shown in Fig. 4. The release of glucose into the medium was reduced from 15.1 μmol/24 h with no insulin to 4.2 μmol of glucose with insulin (Fig. 4). The mass isotopomer distribution in medium glucose (new glucose) is shown in TableII. The enrichment in glucose was 0.42 and 0.44 in the insulin-treated and untreated cells, being about four times that of lactate. Thus, [U-13C]glycerol contributed to 12–16% of carbon atoms of the new glucose molecules. Regardless of insulin treatment, 8–10% of glucose in the medium is labeled with 3 [13C]carbon atoms, 2.7–3% with 2 [13C]carbon atoms, and 6.6–7.1% with 1 [13C]carbon atom per molecule. This pattern is significantly different from that in lactate suggesting sources of M1 and M2 isotopomers of glucose other than the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The mass isotopomer distribution in the C-1—C-4 fragment of glucose aldonitrile penta-acetate is shown in the lower half of Table II. The number of molecules containing 3 [13C]carbon atoms was substantially reduced when carbon 5 and carbon 6 of glucose were cleaved by EI. Only 1.7–1.8% of the molecules contains 3 [13C]carbon atoms in the C-1—C-4 fragment. By comparing the M3 molar fraction of the whole glucose molecule as determined by CI and that in the C-1—C-4 fragment determined by EI, it can be estimated that the glucose molecule was asymmetrically labeled with 20% of M3 labeling C-1—C-3 and 80% labeling C-4—C-6. The molar fractions of M2 glucose (C-1—C-6) in Table II were comparable to the M2 of the C-1—C-4 glucose fragment (Table II, bottom). The distribution of glucose mass isotopomers deduced from the difference between isotopomers in C-1—C-6 and C-1—C-4 fragment is shown in Fig.5. Some randomization of top and bottom of the glucose molecule does occur, secondary to the action of aldolase on fructose-1,6-P (18Katz J. Rognstad R. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2227-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). If the label in M3, M2, and M1 glucose is symmetrically distributed, M1 can be in any of the C-1—C-6 positions, but M2 can only be in C-1—C-2 or C-5—C-6 and M3 in C-1–C-3 or C-4-C-6 (Fig. 5). Therefore, a proportionate amount of M3 and M2 should be lost, greater than the loss in M1, by cleaving off carbon 5 and 6 of glucose by EI. However, if the loss of M3 is more than the loss of M1 and M2 of the C-1—C-4 fragment, it is an indication of M3 in C-4—C-6 being greater than M3 in C-1—C-3 of glucose, and M2 and M1 in C-4-C-6 being less than that in C-1—C-3 glucose. The degree of loss of [13C]glycerol carbon depends on the magnitude of the non-oxidative and oxidative fluxes, relative to the gluconeogenic flux and input of 5 carbon precursors, such as xylitol carbon. These considerations are illustrated by our findings, showing that the reduction in M3 is associated with a slight decrease in M2, as predicted in Fig. 5. The asymmetry in the labeling pattern can only be the result of loss of [13C]carbon through the pentose cycle during gluconeogenesis.Table IIMass isotopomer distribution in C-1–C-6 fragment of media glucose (glucose formed during experiment)m0m1m2m3m4m5m6ΣmnNo insulin Ave ± S.D.0.8010.0710.0270.0920.0050.0020.0020.4440.0200.0110.0020.0060.0010.00020.00020.037Insulin Ave ± S.D.0.8120.0660.0280.0850.0050.0020.0020.4200.0070.0020.0020.0050.0010.00030.00020.023Mass isotopomer distribution in C-1–C-4 fragment of media glucoseNo insulin Ave. ± S.D.0.84410.11760.02140.016900.21120.01050.00690.00320.00140.01572 mm xylitol and 1.5 mm[U-13C]glycerol present with no cold glucose added.

Table III compares the relative enrichments in glycogen glucose derived from Fao cells incubated in the presence of 12.5 mm glucose ± 10−8m insulin to that derived from Fao cells incubated in 2 mm xylitol ± 10−8m insulin with no cold glucose added. The enrichment in glycogen glucose from Fao cells treated with 12.5 mm glucose was 0.349 which was significantly higher than the enrichment of 0.261 from cells treated with 2 mm xylitol (p < 0.005). Enrichment of M3 glucose was also higher for incubation in 12.5 mmglucose than in 2 mm xylitol (6.7 ± 0.7% compared with 5.3 ± 0.5%). The lower enrichment in glucose of the xylitol-treated case may indicate that some of the 2 mmxylitol was converted into glucose carbons via equilibration with the transaldolase and transketolase reactions of the pentose cycle diluting the [13C]carbon label coming from glycerol. Furthermore, this observation is consistent with the absence of glucokinase in Fao cells as reported previously (14Argaud D. Kirby T.L. Newgard C.B. Lange A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12854-12861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If glucokinase were appreciably expressed and active, the enrichment in glycogen glucose from 12.5 mm glucose-treated cells would be lower than that in glycogen from cells incubated with xylitol and no added glucose. However, the enrichment in the glucose-treated cells was higher than that of the xylitol-treated cells supporting the lack of glucokinase activity.Table IIIMass isotopomers in glycogen glucose determined by CIm0m1m2m3m4m5ΣmnNo insulin, glucose Ave ± S.D.0.8390.0590.0280.0660.0060.0010.349 a/b0.0200.0100.0040.0070.0010.0020.032Insulin, glucose Ave ± S.D.0.8580.0440.0260.0670.0040.0000.317 3-aStatistically not different from each of the two conditions treated with glucose.0.0040.0010.0020.00040.00020.0020.016No Insulin, xylitol Ave ± S.D.0.8920.0300.0170.0530.0020.0010.261 3-bStatistically different (p < 0.015) between glucose- and xylitol-treated samples.0.0110.0060.0020.0050.00020.00030.032Insulin, xylitol Ave ± S.D.0.8920.0340.0200.0530.002−0.0010.238 3-bStatistically different (p < 0.015) between glucose- and xylitol-treated samples.0.0170.0090.0030.0050.0010.0020.032Average (ave) and S.D. of triplicates are provided.3-a Statistically not different from each of the two conditions treated with glucose.3-b Statistically different (p < 0.015) between glucose- and xylitol-treated samples.

This mutant (65TS) was produced by transforming a PEX2-defective mutant, Z65, with a mutant PEX2 gene,PEX2 E55K, derived from a patient with infantile Refsum disease, a milder form of peroxisome biogenesis disorder. In 65TS, catalase was found in the cytosol at a nonpermissive temperature (39 °C), but upon the shift to a permissive temperature (33 °C), catalase gradually localized to the structures containing a 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein, PMP70. In contrast to catalase, other matrix proteins containing typical peroxisome targeting signals, acyl-CoA oxidase and peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, were co-localized with PMP70 in most cells, even at 39 °C. We found that these structures are partially functional peroxisomes and named them “catalase-less peroxisomes.” Catalase-less peroxisomes were also observed in human fibroblasts from patients with milder forms of peroxisome biogenesis disorder, including the one from which the mutantPEX2 gene was derived. We suggest that these structures are the causes of the milder phenotypes of the patients. Temperature-dependent restoration of the peroxisomes in 65TS occurred even in the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Thus, we conclude that in 65TS, catalase-less peroxisomes are the direct precursors of peroxisomes.

Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 489-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes commonly contain catalase and at least one enzyme that generates hydrogen peroxide. The roles of mammalian peroxisomes include oxidative processes involving H2O2, β-oxidation of fatty acids, and biosynthesis of plasmalogens. More than 20 genes named PEX (2Distel B. Erdmann R. Gould S.J. Blobel G. Crane D.I. Cregg J.M. Dodt G. Fujiki Y. Goodman J.M. Just W.W. Kiel J.A. Kunau W.H. Lazarow P.B. Mannaerts G.P. Moser H.W. Osumi T. Rachubinski R.A. Roscher A. Subramani S.

Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) have been shown to be involved in peroxisome assembly processes, based on the functional complementation of genetically peroxisome-deficient mutants of mammalian cells and yeasts (3Tabak H.F. Braakman I. Distel B. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 447-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes have been thought to be formed by the division of preexisting peroxisomes following the import of newly synthesized peroxisomal proteins (4Lazarow P.B. Robbi M. Fujiki Y. Wong L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1982; 386: 285-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), but recent observations suggest that endoplasmic reticulum may be involved in the peroxisomal membrane biogenesis at least in certain yeast species (5, 6; for review, see Ref. 7Kunau W.H. Erdmann R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R299-R302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, questions are again being raised about the intracellular origin of peroxisomes. Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs)1 are caused by abnormalities in the assembly processes of peroxisomes. In manyPEX mutant cells, including the fibroblasts from PBD patients, abnormal membrane structures called peroxisomal ghosts are observed (8Santos M.J. Imanaka T. Shio H. Small G.M. Lazarow P.B. Science. 1988; 239: 1536-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 9Santos M.J. Imanaka T. Shio H. Lazarow P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10502-10509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These structures contain a 70-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70) but lack the peroxisomal matrix proteins. PBDs are genetically classified into at least 12 complementation groups (CGs) (10Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Imamura A. Kondo N. Kinoshita N. Fujiki Y. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Imanaka T. Orii T. Beemer F. Mooijer P. Dekker C. Wanders R.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1898-1903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and each CG contains various clinical phenotypes,e.g. Zellweger syndrome (ZS), neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy (NALD), and infantile Refsum disease (IRD). ZS represents the severest form of PBD, NALD is the next severest, and IRD is the mildest (11Lazarow P.B. Moser H.W. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2287-2324Google Scholar). These diseases differ markedly in clinical features, such as age of death and severity of the neurological abnormalities. In the fibroblasts of PBD patients with milder forms, temperature sensitivity was observed in peroxisome assembly, and heterozygous mutations (E55K/R119Stop) were identified in the PEX2 genes of an IRD fibroblast line of CG-F (12Imamura A. Tsukamoto T. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Imanaka T. Fujiki Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Osumi T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1539-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive (TS) mutations were further identified in PEX1 (13Imamura A. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Tsukamoto T. Orii T. Kondo N. Osumi T. Fujiki Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2089-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as PEX13 (14Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Imamura A. Toyama R. Mukai S. Fujiki Y. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Orii T. Wanders R.J. Kondo N. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The TS mutant cells seem to be useful tools for investigating the mechanisms of peroxisome biogenesis, because the peroxisome recovery process can be turned on simply by shifting the culture temperature. Accordingly, we established a stable Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transformant withPEX2 E55K (65TS) on the background of aPEX2-defective mutant, Z65 (15Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In 65TS, peroxisomes formed temperature-dependently. We now report that in 65TS the peroxisomal ghosts indeed are partially functional “catalase-less peroxisomes.” Similar structures were also observed in the fibroblasts from several patients with milder forms of PBD, including the original IRD fibroblast line of CG-F. We suggest that catalase-less peroxisomes are the cause of the milder phenotypes of these patients. In addition, we present evidence that peroxisomes are formed from the catalase-less peroxisomes in 65TS upon temperature shift-down. The humanPEX2 E55K cDNA subcloned in the expression vector pUcD2SRαMCS (16Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Nakai T. Yokota S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Orii T. Fujiki Y. Sakai F. Bogaki A. Yasumo H. Osumi T. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was transfected to aPEX2-deficient CHO cell mutant, Z65, by the calcium phosphate method. Stable clones were selected by limiting dilution, by culturing the transfectants for 6 days in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418. One of the stable transformants revealed a punctate distribution of catalase after 72 h of incubation at 30 °C but no catalase-positive granules at 37 °C, like Z65. We named this clone 65TS. To visualize the peroxisomes in living 65TS cells, we produced a transformant stably expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SKL. This fusion protein has the carboxyl-terminal 25 residues of rat acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX) containing the Ser-Lys-Leu-COOH tripeptide (a typical peroxisome targeting signal (PTS)-1) motif (17Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Ohno K. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 18Miyazawa S. Hayashi H. Hijikata M. Ishii N. Furuta S. Kagamiyama H. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8131-8137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the carboxyl terminus of GFP(105). GFP(105) is a variant green fluorescent protein having much improved fluorescence at higher temperatures (19Yamasaki M. Hashiguchi N. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Bioimages. 1998; 6: 1-7Google Scholar). An expression vector of GFP-SKL, pGFP-SKL, and pMiwhph, a vector carrying a marker gene conferring hygromycin resistance, were co-transfected to 65TS by the calcium phosphate method. Selection was carried out by limiting dilution, by culturing the transfectants for 9 days in the presence of 400 units/ml hygromycin B, and then by culturing for 5 days with both G418 and hygromycin B. A stable clone with a punctate distribution of GFP at 30 °C was isolated and named 65TS-TSKL. Cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The fibroblasts from PBD patients were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and TS CHO mutant cells were maintained at 39 °C in 5% CO2. For the analysis of temperature-dependent peroxisome restoration, temperature pairs of 37/30 °C and 39/33 °C were used for human fibroblasts and CHO cells, respectively. Higher temperatures were used for the CHO-derived cells, because they grew much faster at 33 °C than 30 °C and exhibited clearer TS phenotypes at 39 °C than at 37 °C. Peroxisomes of CHO cells and human fibroblasts were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence staining, as described (20Osumi T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Yokota S. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Hijikata M. Miyazawa S. Hashimoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The first antibodies used were rabbit antibodies to rat catalase (from Dr. N. Usuda), rat AOX, rat peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (PT), and human catalase (each from Dr. T. Hashimoto), and rat PMP70 or guinea pig antibodies to rat PMP70 and catalase. The anti-PMP70 antibodies were prepared using the carboxyl-terminal 15-residue peptide of the protein as an antigen (21Imanaka T. Shiina Y. Takano T. Hashimoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3706-3713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The antigen-antibody complexes were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-labeled goat antibody to rabbit IgG or Cy3-labeled donkey antibody to guinea pig IgG. Cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 2 days at selected temperatures. The medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing proline but lacking cysteine and methionine and supplemented with dialyzed fetal calf serum at 10%. After incubation for 24 h at each temperature with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with specific rabbit antibodies to rat AOX, catalase, and PMP70. Immunocomplexes were recovered with fixedStaphylococcus aureus cells (Zysorbin, Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography, as described (22Tsukamoto T. Yokota S. Fujiki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For the experiment on the effect of cycloheximide, the drug was added at varying concentrations to the medium 1 h before the addition of radioactive amino acids, and the radioisotope was allowed to be incorporated for 24 h at 33 °C. We previously showed that an IRD patient with CG-F PBD carried heterozygous mutations in the PEX2 gene, E55K and R119Stop (12Imamura A. Tsukamoto T. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Imanaka T.

Genet. 1998; 62: 1539-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A), and the former was responsible for the TS phenotype of the patient's cells in peroxisome assembly. We isolated a temperature-sensitive CHO mutant, 65TS, by introducing the E55K mutant PEX2 gene into thePEX2-defective CHO mutant, Z65 (15Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Z65 itself exhibited a punctate distribution of catalase at neither 33 °C (Fig.1 B, a) nor 39 °C (data not shown), although PMP70 exhibited a punctate staining pattern, representing the ghosts (Fig. 1 B, b). In 65TS, catalase was found in the cytosol at 39 °C (Fig. 1 B, c), whereas PMP70 had a particulate distribution (Fig. 1 B, d). When 65TS was incubated at 33 °C for 48 h, however, catalase was co-localized with PMP70 in almost all the cells (Fig. 1 B,e and f). We pursued the time course of peroxisome recovery in 65TS (Fig. 2). After 3 h of incubation at 33 °C, we observed some cells containing a few punctates of catalase. After 6 h, we could identify in many cells catalase-positive granules that were also positive for PMP70 (data not shown). Most cells contained catalase-positive granules after 24 h of incubation at 33 °C, and virtually all cells had peroxisomes by 48 h. Thus, it took at least 3 to 6 h for the recovery of peroxisomes in 65TS, and the process was completed within 48 h.Figure 2Time course of peroxisome recovery in 65TS. The cells were first cultured at 39 °C and then kept for the period indicated at 33 °C.

Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) With respect to the peroxisome assembly, 65TS shuttled between the phenotypes similar to the wild-type CHO and Z65, depending on the temperatures. Fibroblasts from a TS patient belonging to CG-F (F-05) lack the peroxisomes, like the fibroblasts from ZS patients at 37 °C, but when incubated at 30 °C, the F-05 fibroblasts regain the peroxisomes to the same level as those of the normal fibroblasts (12Imamura A. Tsukamoto T. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Imanaka T. Fujiki Y. Orii T. Kondo N. Osumi T. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 62: 1539-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thus, the phenotypes of 65TS seemed similar to those of the fibroblasts from the TS patient and would be useful for studying the mechanism of peroxisome biogenesis and molecular defects of TS PBDs. Using GFP-SKL carrying a typical PTS-1 at the carboxyl end, we tried to visualize the peroxisomes in living 65TS cells. Interestingly, the stable transformant expressing GFP-SKL, named 65TS-TSKL, revealed a punctate GFP distribution consistent with that of PMP70 at 39 °C (Fig. 3, a and b) as well as at 33 °C (Fig. 3, c and d). This was in contrast to the cytosolic distribution of catalase at 39 °C (Fig. 3, e and f). Catalase exhibited punctate staining superimposable with the GFP-SKL distribution in 65TS-TSKL at 33 °C (Fig. 3, g and h). Even at the permissive temperature, however, the punctate distribution of catalase and expression of GFP-SKL were complementary to each other,i.e. catalase-positive particles were only observed in the cells weakly expressing GFP-SKL (see Fig. 3 legend). On the other hand, we observed that AOX and PT, having a typical PTS-1 and PTS-2, respectively, were colocalized with GFP-SKL to particulate structures at 39 °C (data not shown). Catalase has a variant PTS-1, KANL, at the carboxyl terminus. Thus, we reasoned that the proteins carrying typical PTSs would be translocated to the peroxisome-like structures more easily than catalase. Typical PTS proteins but not catalase would be translocated at 39 °C, and the former would be more efficiently imported to peroxisomes than the latter at 33 °C. We next examined the localization of the peroxisomal matrix proteins in the original 65TS cells instead of 65TS-TSKL (Fig. 4 A). When 65TS cells were stained with anti-AOX or anti-PT antibody, punctate staining overlapping with that of PMP70 was observed, even at 39 °C. In a parallel experiment, we confirmed that catalase was diffusely distributed in the cytosol at this temperature (data not shown). Thus, the proteins having typical PTSs were indeed selectively translocated to peroxisome-like structures at the nonpermissive temperature. Catalase, on the other hand, was hardly imported to these structures under the same conditions. This seems rather surprising, because catalase has been used as a representative marker of peroxisomes. We examined whether these peroxisome-like structures had normal biochemical functions of peroxisomes, based on several criteria. We first inspected whether AOX was correctly processed in these structures by a radiolabeling experiment, as described (22Tsukamoto T. Yokota S. Fujiki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). For 65TS incubated at 33 °C, processing of AOX (proteolytic conversion of the component A to components B and C (18Miyazawa S. Hayashi H. Hijikata M. Ishii N. Furuta S. Kagamiyama H. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8131-8137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although component C was hardly detected under these conditions) was observed to the same extent as in the wild-type CHO (Fig. 4 B). Comparable amounts of the enzyme (the sum of components A and B) were recovered from 65TS and the wild-type CHO; these amounts were significantly larger than that from Z65, reflecting the stabilization of the enzyme by segregation into peroxisomes. It was indeed shown (15Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) that AOX is highly unstable in Z65 and stabilized upon complementation by the normalPEX2 gene. These results indicate that normal peroxisomes were formed in 65TS by shifting the temperature to 33 °C. Even at 39 °C, the total amounts of components A and B were comparable in 65TS and the wild-type CHO and were much larger than in Z65. This suggested that, even at 39 °C, AOX was segregated into peroxisomes or peroxisome-like structures in 65TS to an extent close to that in the wild-type CHO. A less efficient but considerable level of processing was observed in 65TS at 39 °C (Fig. 4 B,lane 3), suggesting a partial functionality of the processing system at this temperature. The poorer processing would not affect the enzymatic function of AOX, because it is known that the unprocessed recombinant AOX expressed in Escherichia coli is fully active (23Setoyama C. Tamaoki H. Nishina Y. Shiga K. Miura R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 482-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the metabolic functions of these peroxisome-like structures, the β-oxidation capacity of very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) and peroxisomal dihydroxyacetone phosphate acyltransferase (DHAP-AT) activity were measured (TableI). 65TS incubated at both 30 and 37 °C exhibited significant VLCFA β-oxidation and peroxisomal DHAP-AT activities, which were comparable with those of the wild-type CHO. Note that these experiments were done at the 30/37 °C temperature pair, because the experimental conditions had been established at these temperatures. Thus, the biochemical activities of the peroxisome-like structures observed in 65TS at higher temperatures were normal with respect to these two parameters. Hence, we concluded that these structures indeed were nearly functional peroxisomes, though their functions seemed partial, because they lacked catalase and had much lower processing activity of AOX. We named the structures catalase-less peroxisomes.Table ICapacity of VLCFA β-oxidation and peroxisomal DHAP-AT activity37 °C30 °CC24/C16CHO5.5311.5Z650.680.7865TS10.911.7DHAP-ATCHO1.061.45Z650.270.2565TS1.240.91Cells were cultured for 8 days at 37 °C or 30 °C and then measured for the enzyme activities at 37 °C. The β-oxidation activities of palmitic (C16) and lignoceric (C24) acids were measured, and the VLCFA β-oxidation capacity was represented by the ratio of the activities against C24 and C16 fatty acids (45Suzuki Y.

Result of a single experiment is shown. Catalase-less peroxisomes were also found in the IRD fibroblast line of CG-F that originally carried thePEX2 E55K mutation (Fig.5). Although catalase exhibited only diffuse cytosolic staining, both AOX and PT did exhibit a punctate distribution in many cells at 37 °C. The punctate pattern was more prominent and found in a higher percentage of cells (more than 70% of the total) with anti-PT antibody than with anti-AOX antibody, indicating an efficient translocation of PT in this IRD cell line. AOX, PT, and catalase were all cytosolic in the ZS cells of CG-F (F-01) (data not shown). It should be noted that the VLCFA β-oxidation and DHAP-AT activities of the same CG-F TS human fibroblasts as used in this study (F-05) were considerably higher than those of the CG-F ZS fibroblasts, even at 37 °C (24Imamura A. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Tsukamoto T. Fujiki Y. Orii T. Osumi T. Kondo N. Brain Dev. 2000; 22: 8-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, the milder phenotypes of this IRD patient are likely to have resulted from these catalase-less peroxisomes, having partial biochemical functions at 37 °C. It should be pointed out, however, that the functions of the catalase-less peroxisomes of human fibroblasts were significantly reduced compared with those of 65TS, with respect to these biochemical parameters. Catalase has usually been used as the definitive marker to discriminate normal peroxisomes from nonfunctional peroxisomal ghosts. The presence of catalase-less peroxisomes in an IRD patient of CG-F (F-05) raised the question whether patients with milder forms of PBD generally have hitherto overlooked similar structures. Accordingly, we examined this possibility with the fibroblasts from an NALD patient of CG-C (C-11) 2A. Imamura, N. Shimozawa, Y. Suzuki, and N. Kondo, unpublished result on the assignment of patient. and an NALD and IRD patient of CG-E (E-13 and E-24, respectively; see Ref. 13Imamura A. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Tsukamoto T.

Interaction between these two peroxins was shown (30Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Fujiki Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 1998; 18: 936-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and hence it would seem reasonable that a defect in either of them would result in similar phenotypes. In addition, a TS mutation (G843D) has been identified in the PEX1 gene of patient E-24 (13Imamura A. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Zhang Z. Tsukamoto T. Orii T. Kondo N. Osumi T. Fujiki Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2089-2094Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When these fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C, catalase was found in the cytosol, without a punctate pattern of distribution (Fig.6). On the other hand, AOX and PT exhibited punctate staining in around 80% of cells (Fig. 6), although the signals were weaker, and the number of particles in each cell was smaller than in normal cells (data not shown). These particles were mostly superimposable with those of PMP70 and hence regarded as peroxisome-related structures, although some particles seemed to be irregular protein aggregates not overlapping with PMP70 signals. Heavy abnormal aggregations of AOX and PT were observed in a considerable number of cells, especially for C-11 and E-13 (data not shown). All cells contained many PMP70-positive particles. A considerable number of these particles were negative or below the detection limit for the staining of AOX or PT. Thus, the import of AOX and PT in these mutant cells seemed less efficient than that in normal cells. We observed no such particulate staining of AOX in ZS cells of the same CGs, although weak particulate signals of PT were found in a small number of cells (data not shown). Hence, we conclude that the cells of milder PBD phenotypes contain catalase-less peroxisomes for at least CGs C, E, and F, albeit at lower levels of matrix protein accumulation in these structures. In 65TS cells, peroxisomes were formed temperature-dependently. To examine whether peroxisomes were restored from the preexisting catalase-less peroxisomes by the import of catalase from the cytosol, we investigated whether the recovery process was inhibited by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. 65TS cells cultured at 39 °C were further cultured for 24 h at 33 °C in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Immunostaining of catalase showed that the enzyme was colocalized with PMP70 even in the presence of the drug (Fig.7 A, c andd), although the PMP70-containing structures seemed to be large in size and irregular in shape as compared with those of the cells cultured without the drug (Fig. 7 A, a andb). By radiolabeling the cells, we confirmed that this concentration of cycloheximide completely inhibited the synthesis of catalase and PMP70 (Fig. 7, B and C). Total protein synthesis also virtually ceased at this concentration of the drug (Fig. 7 D), and the incorporation of radioactivity into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble materials decreased by 97% under these conditions (data not shown). These results suggest that the cytosolically distributed catalase became colocalized with the pre-accumulated PMP70 upon temperature shift, without requiring de novo protein synthesis. This also means that pre-accumulated mutant Pex2p is converted from a less active to an active form upon temperature shift, which in turn supports the translocation of catalase. Hence, we conclude that peroxisomes are derived from the catalase-less peroxisomes in 65TS. These results well conform to the notion that peroxisomes are formed from the ghosts by functional complementation of the peroxisome-deficient mutant cells (33Yamasaki M. Hashiguchi N. Fujiwara C. Imanaka T. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35293-35296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, these results support the hypothesis that peroxisomes can develop by incorporating the newly synthesized peroxisomal proteins from the cytosol. The present results indicate that transfer of thePEX2 E55K gene into the PEX2-defective CHO mutant, Z65, transmitted the TS phenotype observed in the F-05 IRD fibroblasts. In the resulting CHO line, 65TS, catalase was found in the cytosol at 39 °C, but its distribution became peroxisomal upon shift-down to 33 °C. On the other hand, AOX and PT carrying a typical PTS-1 and PTS-2, respectively, exhibited a peroxisomal distribution in many cells, even at 39 °C. Although catalase seems to be translocated by the PTS-1 pathway, its KANL peptide sequence at the carboxyl terminus deviates from the consensus (34Purdue P.E. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Therefore, the complex of catalase and Pex5p, the PTS-1 receptor, is possibly formed with lower efficiency than complexes of typical PTS-1 proteins. This would make the steady state concentration of catalase-Pex5p too low to be captured by the peroxisomal import machinery containing the TS Pex2p, at the nonpermissive temperature. The effect of poorer recognition by the receptor is accentuated when catalase must compete with an excess amount of a typical PTS-1 protein (Fig. 3, gand h). In this situation, catalase is not translocated to peroxisomes to a significant extent even at 33 °C. Proteins carrying typical PTSs, however, form high steady state concentrations of the complexes with the receptors, high enough to be recognized even by the less active import machinery at the nonpermissive temperature. The restoration of catalase import at the permissive temperature clearly depends on the transition of the mutant Pex2p from the less active (or inactive) state to the (more) active state, because the process was not inhibited by cycloheximide. The mutant Pex2p would be integrated into the membrane of the catalase-less peroxisomes normally even at the nonpermissive temperature, thus supporting the import of typical PTS proteins and, upon temperature shift-down, the import of catalase. It is reasonable to suspect that the mutant Pex2p is in an equilibrium between the two states at any temperature. Thus, at 39 °C, the total activity of the import machinery involving the mutant Pex2p would be insufficient to support the translocation of catalase but nearly sufficient to take up typical PTS proteins, whereas the activity would reach a level high enough to allow the catalase import at 33 °C. To verify this notion, we expressed thePEX2 E55K gene at a lower level by putting the gene under the control of the basal promoter of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene. This resulted in incomplete import of AOX and PT at 39 °C and poor catalase import even at 33 °C (data not shown). Thus, the import efficiencies of individual peroxisomal matrix proteins depend on a delicate balance between the intrinsic intensities of the individual import signals and the net activity of the peroxisomal import machinery. The peroxisome-like structures observed in 65TS cells at 39 °C, which contain AOX and PT but not catalase, indeed are nearly functional catalase-less peroxisomes (Table I and Fig. 4 B). AOX was equally stable at 39 °C as in the wild-type CHO cells, probably reflecting the effective segregation into the peroxisomal lumen. The processing of AOX, however, was less efficient, possibly because of poorer assembly of the processing system. Catalase-less peroxisomes were also observed in the fibroblasts of PBD patients with milder phenotypes, belonging to three CGs: C, E, and F. The CG-F patient was the original carrier of the PEX2 E55K mutant gene. In these cells, AOX and PT exhibited punctate patterns of distribution overlapping with that of PMP70 at 37 °C, although the staining intensities were weaker than those in 65TS. In the CG-F cells, the VLCFA oxidation and DHAP-AT activities were higher than those of ZS cells of the same CG, although much lower than the wild-type activities (24Imamura A. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y.

Orii T. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Fujiki Y. Wanders R.J. Besley G. Kondo N. J. Med. Genet. 1999; 36: 779-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, the patient fibroblasts of CG-F and the 65TS model CHO cells had similar TS phenotypes, but the functional defect at the nonpermissive temperature was much more prominent in the former. This was probably due to the weaker expression of the endogenousPEX2 gene in the human fibroblasts than of the ectopicPEX2 gene under the control of the viral expression system, which was carried by 65TS. The present observations suggest that the partially functional catalase-less peroxisomes would support the milder phenotypes of NALD and IRD patients, at least in the cases studied. Evaluation of peroxisomes of PBD patients based on immunofluorescent microscopy should be done not only for catalase but also for typical PTS proteins such as β-oxidation enzymes. Import of catalase to the catalase-less peroxisomes at the permissive temperature was not inhibited by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. The most feasible interpretation of these results would be that the catalase pre-accumulated in the cytosol directly enters the preexisting catalase-less peroxisomes. The involvement of a vesicle fusion process in peroxisome biogenesis was proposed, based on the results of biochemical studies (36Titorenko V.I. Chan H. Rachubinski R.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that catalase import occurs only to immature peroxisomes (or precursor vesicles), not mature peroxisomes. Our results would be compatible with this model if we suppose the involvement of recycling membrane vesicles in the translocation of pre-accumulated catalase to the catalase-less peroxisomes. The present results are consistent with the result for thePEX5 mutant CHO cells (33Yamasaki M. Hashiguchi N. Fujiwara C. Imanaka T. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35293-35296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that the restoration of peroxisomes by the microinjection of Pex5p can occur in the presence of cycloheximide and hence involves the translocation of the cytosolically accumulated PTS proteins into the peroxisomal ghosts. Catalase-less peroxisomes as well as peroxisomal ghosts are the structures that form on the blockade of the normal course of peroxisome biogenesis because of a deficiency of one of the essential PEX gene products. Thus, these structures reflect the processes of peroxisome biogenesis, even if they themselves do not represent the biogenesis intermediates. They are ready to accept the PTS proteins if the correctPEX gene products are supplied. The shapes and biochemical compositions, however, may differ depending on the defective gene as well as the severity of deficiency. The recovery processes also probably differ depending on the defective genes. Moreover, net formation of the peroxisomal membrane from a certain membrane seems essential in the mutants defective in one of the three PEXgenes, PEX3, PEX16, and PEX19, because these mutants lack peroxisomal ghosts but nevertheless are complemented for peroxisome biogenesis by the transfer of respective genes (10Shimozawa N.

Because plasmin degrades fibrin to dissolve blood clots, Pg activators such as streptokinase (SK) are widely used in the medical treatment of heart attacks (2GUSTO Investigators N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (3630) Google Scholar). SK indirectly activates Pg by forming an “activator complex” with Pg through high affinity binding interactions (3Reed G.L.

In this complex, SK non-proteolytically rearranges the latent activation domain of Pg to generate an active site (Pg*) in a manner similar to chymotrypsinogen activation, then SK acts as a cofactor that permits the binding and processing of substrate Pg molecules (5McClintock D.K.

However, because of its fibrin independence, SK activity is not targeted or restricted to fibrin, which appears to make it less effective for dissolving blood clots in humans (2GUSTO Investigators N.

The NH2-terminal peptide of SK, spanning residues 1–59 (particularly 24–59), gives the activator complex the capacity for fibrin-independent Pg activation through unknown mechanisms (11Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When the NH2-terminal peptide is removed, SK requires fibrin as a cofactor for efficient Pg activation (11Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SK1–59 contains the first and second β strands of the A domain (β1 and β2), which interact with a loop of microplasmin that spans residues 713 to 721 (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Glu-39 of SK forms a salt bridge with Arg-719 of microplasmin, which in turn has a van der Waals contact with Val-19 (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Phe-37 appears to stack on the aliphatic side chain of Arg-719 and to interact with Trp-761 of microplasmin. Residues 1–15 and 46–70 of the SK NH2-terminal peptide are disordered, and residues 42–46 contain a fibronectin motif L42TSRPA. Although this fibronectin motif has no contact interactions with microplasmin in the activator complex, fibronectin can bind plasmin and inhibit Pg activation by SK (13Gonzalez G.M. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1180: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), which suggests that residues in this motif could play a key functional role. Finally, in modeling studies that dock the substrate Pg with the activator complex, there is a potential interaction between SK residues 45–50 and kringle 5 of substrate Pg (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Indeed recent studies show that Pg substrate binding is kringle-dependent (14Lin L.-F. Houng A. Reed G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4740-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition to its potential interactions with Pg substrate, the NH2-terminal peptide (or subdomain A1) also interacts with another fragment (subdomain A2) to reconstitute the structure of the SK A domain (residues 1–148) (15Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The A domain has more extensive molecular contacts with microplasmin in a crystal structure of the activator complex than the other two domains of SK (B and C) (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Still, the isolated A domain has been reported not to bind to Pg, although the NH2-terminal peptide of SK (A1) markedly augments the binding affinity of the remaining SK molecule (A2, B, C) for Pg (16Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2190-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal peptide may contribute to this binding because it binds with A2 to restructure the A domain (15Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P. Dobson C.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 693-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or because it contains an extra Pg binding site (16Conejero-Lara F. Parrado J. Azuaga A.I. Dobson C.M. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2190-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 17Nihalani D. Raghava G.P. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1284-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These studies suggest several potential mechanisms through which residues in the NH2-terminal peptide of SK may foster fibrin-independent Pg activation. First, by virtue of their interaction with the plasmin moiety in the activator complex, they may stabilize the catalytic function of the complex. Alternatively, they may directly dock Pg substrate to the activator complex, or indirectly, through intermolecular interactions they may structure the A domain to permit binding between this domain and Pg substrate. To examine these hypotheses, we studied the contribution of key residues in the NH2-terminal peptide through mutagenesis. Mutations of residues that directly interact with the plasmin moiety in the activator complex reduced Pg activation, confirming their functional role in the activator complex. Mutation of a residue (Leu-42) in the fibronectin motif of the NH2-terminal peptide caused a marked defect in fibrin-independent Pg activation. This mutation (L42A) did not alter the binding of the NH2-terminal peptide (A1) to the remaining SK fragment (A2-B-C or residues 60–414). Nor did the L42A mutation affect the ability of the NH2-terminal peptide to simultaneously bind two molecules of Pg, an interaction that may dock Pg substrate with the plasmin or Pg* moiety in the activator complex. Instead, the L42A mutation prevented the A1 fragment from restructuring the native conformation of the A domain, which appears necessary for the fibrin-independent processing of Pg substrate by the activator complex. The SK gene was cloned from Streptococcus equisimilis, expressed in bacteria via the pMALc vector (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and purified as described in detail (3Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami-Seren B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The recombinant (r) deletion mutant lacking the first 59 (rSKΔ59) amino acids has been described (11Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the SK 1–59 sequence was performed by polymerase chain reaction with overlap extension using the following primers: SKT43A sense, atcgatctagcatcacg, and SKT43A antisense, cgtgatgctagatcgat; SKE39Q sense, tttcaaatcgatctaacatc, and SKE39Q antisense, gatgttagatcgatttgaaa; SKF37A sense gtccttaaagcttttgaaatc, and SKF37A antisense, gatttcaaaagctttaagac; SKL42A sense, atgcaagcatcacgacct, and SKL42A antisense, aggtcgtgatgttgcat. The polymerase chain reaction products were sequenced on both strands to confirm the target mutations and ligated into pMalc for expression in bacteria (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor1989Google Scholar). The purity of the rSK proteins was assessed by SDS-polymerase chain reaction as described (3Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami-Seren B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recombinant microPg that spanned residues 530–791 of human Pg was cloned into pET11d (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), expressed in bacteria, and purified as described in detail (11Reed G.L. Houng A.K.

The molar quantity of active sites generated by the various rSK-Pg activator complexes was determined at 25 °C in a Hitachi 2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer by active site titration with the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferylp-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma) as described (3Reed G.L.

The amidase kinetic parameters of the activator complexes were measured with a p-nitroanilide substrate (S2251, H-d-valyl-l-leucyl-l-lysine-p-nitroanilide dihydrochloride, Chromogenix, Sweden) as described (3Reed G.L.

The rSK (20 nm) and Glu-Pg (10 nm; ≥95% Glu-type, Pharmacia Hepar, Franklin, Ohio) were mixed together and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to construct the SK-Pg activator complex. By immunoblotting studies (20Lin L.F. Oeun S. Houng A. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16879-16885Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), this batch of Glu-Pg had less than 1% plasmin or Lys-Pg. The mixture was then transferred to a thermostatically regulated (37 °C) quartz cuvette containing assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and various concentrations of S2251 (100–800 μm) in a total volume of 300 μl. The change in absorbance was monitored at 405 nm for 5 min at 37 °C in a thermostatted Cary 100-Bio spectrophotometer. The data were plotted as velocity/[substrate] and analyzed by hyperbolic curve fitting with the use of the Sigma Plot program. The effects of NH2-terminal mutations on Pg activation by rSKΔ59 were also studied as described (3Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami-Seren B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 7Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 11Reed G.L.

In these studies Glu-Pg and rSKΔ59 were mixed together in stoichiometric ratios for various times (as indicated) to form an activator complex. In some cases native or mutant rSK1–59 was pre-incubated with SKΔ59 overnight at 4 °C before formation of an activator complex. The activator complex was then added (10 nm) to a quartz cuvette containing assay buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), 500 μm S2251, and various concentrations of Glu-Pg (50–750 nm) in a total volume of 300 μl. The change in absorbance at 405 nm was monitored at 37 °C as described. Initial reaction rates were obtained from the first 300 s by plottingA 405/time2, and the apparent Michaelis constants and catalytic rate constants were calculated by fitting the data to a hyperbolic curve as described (3Reed G.L.

The effect of rSK1–59 (native or mutant) on the activation of bovine Pg (300 nm) by the stoichiometric complex of rSKΔ59 and human plasmin was also studied in a similar fashion. Radioiodination was performed using the Iodogen reagent (Pierce) (21Fraker P.C. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1978; 80: 849-857Google Scholar), and the specific activity was determined as described (3Reed G.L. Lin L.F. Parhami-Seren B. Kussie P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10266-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 22Lukacova D. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Reed G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10164-10170Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Wells of microtiter plates were coated with Glu-Pg (5 μg/ml). The wells were washed, and nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Radioiodinated rSK1–59 (200,000 cpm/25 μl) was added to the wells in the presence of various amounts of rSK1–59 proteins (0 to 200 μg/ml) added as competitors. The percent inhibition of binding of native rSK1–59 to Glu-Pg by various concentrations of mutant rSK1–59 was corrected for the nonspecific binding of 125I-rSK1–59 to wells not coated with Pg (which was ∼1% of total). Wells were coated with rSKΔ59 (20 μg/ml) or purified MBP (20 μg/ml) or no antigen. The wells were washed and blocked with 1% BSA. After that rSK1–59 (native or mutant, 50 μl, 0–100 μg/ml) was added. After a 1-h incubation and washing, the anti-SK NH2-terminal monoclonal antibody (mAb) 9D10 (23Reed G.L. Kussie P. Parhami-Seren B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4407-4415PubMed Google Scholar, 24Parhami-Seren B. Keel T. Reed G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was added for 1 h. After washing bound mAb was detected by 125I goat anti-mouse Ab (50,000 cpm) followed by γ-counting. Microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of Glu-Pg (5 μg/ml) or no protein (control). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% BSA. After washing, SK1–59 or rSKΔ59 (50 μl) was added in different concentrations (0–100 μg/ml). After 1 h, wells were washed, and 50 μl of rabbit anti-MBP Ab was added for 1 h. After washing, bound Ab was detected by 50 μl of 125I-protein A followed by γ-counting. Microtiter plates were coated with or without Glu-Pg (5 μg/ml), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA. After that rSK1–59 (native or L42A, 10 μg/ml) or MBP (10 μg/ml) was added for 1 h. After washing,125I-Glu-Pg was added for 1 h before wells were washed and γ-counted. Native or L42A mutant rSK1–59 (5 μg/ml) were mixed together with rSKΔ59 (10 μg/ml) or kept separate for 1 h. Microtiter plates were coated with the mixed or separate proteins for 1 h. After blocking with 1% BSA (1 h) and washing, various conformation-dependent and -independent mAb hybridoma supernatants were added for 1 h. After washing, bound mAb was detected by 125I goat anti-mouse Ab followed by γ-counting. The binding of these anti-SK mAbs to native rSK or the isolated rSK A, B, or C domains was assessed in a similar binding assay. Previous studies show that recombinant NH2-terminal peptide of SK (rSK1–59), when mixed stoichiometrically with the remaining SK molecule (rSKΔ59), restored fibrin-independent Pg activation to the activator complex to levels comparable with full-length rSK (11Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because deletion of amino acids 24–59 profoundly reduced fibrin-independent Pg activation, we used mutagenesis to examine the functional role of residues in this region (11Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We selected for mutation Glu-39 (which forms a salt bridge with microplasmin Arg-719), Phe-37 (which interacts with microplasmin Trp-761 and Arg-719), and two conserved residues (Thr-42, Leu-43) in the fibronectin motif (which have no apparent intermolecular interactions) (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Serrano R.L. Rodriguez P. Pizzo S.V. Gonzalez G.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the absence of the NH2-terminal peptide (rSK1–59), rSKΔ59 alone could not significantly activate Glu-Pg (Fig. 1 A). The addition of rSK1–59 containing the native sequence or with a mutation of Thr-43 to Ala (T43A) markedly amplified Pg activation. By comparison with native rSK1–59, the activity of the F37A and Glu-39 mutants was modestly reduced, and the L42A mutant demonstrated virtually no activity. To determine whether the reduced function of these rSK1–59 mutants was due to an impaired kinetic ability to form a complex with rSKΔ59, both mutants and rSKΔ59 were pre-incubated together overnight at 4 °C and then tested in the same Pg activation assay. The rate of Pg activation improved after longer incubation for all of the mutants (Fig. 1, B versus A), which suggested that the rate of complex formation between the rSK1–59 and rSKΔ59 fragments was rate-limiting. However, despite slight improvement with overnight incubation, the L42A mutant (rSK1–59L42A) was still impaired in its ability to restore Pg activation to the rSKΔ59 fragment. Even incubation of rSK1–59L42A, rSKΔ59, and Pg overnight at 4 °C did not restore normal activity to the activator complex (data not shown). Kinetic studies were used to further characterize the functional defects in the rSK1–59L42A. In parallel assays the activator complexes formed by native rSK1–59 or rSK1–59L42A with Glu-Pg showed only minor differences (≤2-fold) in the kinetics of amidolysis for a small peptide substrate (TableI B). In contrast, rSK1–59L42A had more marked effects on the kinetics of Pg activation. The activator complex formed with rSK1–59L42Ahad a 50-fold lower k cat for Glu-Pg substrate than the native rSK1–59 sequence (Table I A). The relatively selective defect in Pg activation versus amidolysis suggested that the Leu-42 was required for the processing of Pg substrate by the activator complex but was not required for the generation or stabilization of the active site per se. If this was true, the L42A mutation should also impair Pg activation when the activator complex contains plasmin, which already possesses a productively arranged active site. To distinguish the effects of the NH2 terminus on the plasmin in the activator complex from its potential interactions with Pg substrate (see below), bovine Pg was used as a substrate because it does not form an activator complex with SK (26Wulf R.J. Mertz E.T. Can. J. Biochem. 1969; 47: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When compared with the rSKΔ59-plasmin activator complex containing wild-type rSK1–59, the activator complex containing rSK1–59L42A showed a diminished ability to activate bovine Pg substrate (Fig. 2).Table ISteady state Pg activation and amidolytic parametersType of SKKmk catk cat/K mμmminμm −1 · minrSKΔ59 + rSK1–590.165 ± 0.0581.59 ± 0.329.6rSKΔ59 + rSK1–59L42A0.035 ± 0.0050.032 ± 0.0020.91B.

If SK 1–59 plays a selective role in the processing of Pg substrate by the activator complex, it may directly interact with Pg or plasmin in the activator complex and/or Pg substrate. Experiments confirmed that rSK1–59, like rSKΔ59, bound in a saturable and specific fashion to Glu-Pg (Fig.3 A). Comparative inhibition studies were performed to determine whether the L42A mutation altered the binding interactions of rSK1–59 with Glu-Pg. The binding of native125I-rSK1–59 to Glu-Pg was specifically inhibited by unlabeled native rSK1–59 with an IC50 of 0.3 μm (Fig. 3 B). A similar inhibition of125I-rSK1–59 binding was seen with rSK1–59L42A, indicating that this mutation did not significantly affect these binding interactions. Thus the impaired function caused by the L42A mutation was not due to abnormal binding to Glu-Pg. To give the activator complex the ability to efficiently activate Pg in the absence of fibrin, SK1–59 may contribute to binding interactions between the moiety Pg or plasmin in the activator complex and Pg substrate. Thus we examined whether SK1–59 could simultaneously bind two different Pg molecules. In the absence of rSK1–59,125I-Glu-Pg showed no significant binding to immobilized Glu-Pg substrate (Fig. 3 C). However, the binding of rSK1–59 to wells coated with Glu-Pg enhanced the subsequent binding of125I-Glu-Pg, which indicated that rSK1–59 was capable of simultaneously binding or docking two Pg molecules (Fig.3 C). In the same assay, rSK1–59L42A also showed a comparable ability to dock Pg molecules. Because SK1–59 or subdomain A1 has been reported to bind to subdomain A2 () we investigated the interactions of rSK1–59 with rSKΔ59. Both the wild-type rSK1–59 fragment and rSK1–59L42A bound comparably with SKΔ59 in solid phase binding studies (Fig.4). In the crystal structure of the SK-microplasmin complex, the Leu-42 side chain is oriented inward and has potential hydrophobic interactions that may contribute to the structure of the A domain (Fig. 6). To detect whether the L42A mutation altered the structure of the A domain when it interacted with rSKΔ59, we used a panel of well characterized mAbs that bind to conformation-dependent and -independent epitopes in native SK (23Reed G.L. Kussie P. Parhami-Seren B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4407-4415PubMed Google Scholar, 24Parhami-Seren B. Keel T. Reed G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The mAbs that recognize the native conformation of the A domain of SK (1E10 and 2E8, Fig.5 A) bound to the complex formed by native rSK1–59 and rSKΔ59 but only partially to the complex formed by rSK1–59L42A and rSKΔ59 (Fig.5 B). As expected, these mAbs bound minimally to rSKΔ59 alone and not to rSK1–59. However, under the same conditions, the conformation-independent antibody directed to the A domain (9G12, Fig.5 A) bound comparably with rSKΔ59 alone or in complex with rSK1–59 (Fig. 5 B). Similarly, a mAb (8F5) directed against the B domain of SK (Fig. 5 A) showed comparable binding to rSKΔ59 alone or to the mixture of native or mutant rSK1–59 with rSKΔ59 (Fig. 5 B). This indicates that the complex formed by rSKΔ59 with native rSK1–59 more closely recapitulates the native conformational structure of the A domain of SK than does the complex formed by rSKΔ59 with rSK1–59L42A.Figure 6Structural interactions of Leu-42 in the SK A domain (12Wang X.

A, the side chain of Leu-42 is oriented inward and appears to contribute to the formation of a hydrophobic core through side-chain interactions with Leu-18, Leu-74, Leu-127, Phe-135, and Ile-40.

In this structure Leu-87, Ile-83, and Leu-79 are on the same hydrophobic surface of the helix (α3,4; see Ref. 12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) in the A2 subdomain. Leu-74 also faces the same surface. In the A1 subdomain several residues (Leu-18, Val-22, Ile-33, Leu-35, Ile-40, Leu-42) form a complementary hydrophobic surface that pairs with the hydrophobic surface of the helix in the A2 subdomain. Phe-38 of the A1 subdomain also extends into the hydrophobic interface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Complex formation between rSK1–59 and rSKΔ59 detected by conformation-dependent anti-SK antibodies. A, binding specificity of conformation-dependent (2E8 and 1E10) and -independent (9G12 and 8F5) anti-SK monoclonal antibodies for native SK and SK domains. Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with purified rSK domains (A, B, and C) or native rSK (50 μl, 5 μg/ml) or no SK (Ctl) and then blocked with 1% BSA. After washing, mAb hybridoma supernatants were added for 1 h. After additional washing, bound mAb was detected by125I-goat anti-mouse Ab followed by γ-counting.B, binding of conformation-dependent and -independent antibodies to rSK1–59 and rSKΔ59 alone and to the rSK1–59 and rSKΔ59 complex. Native or L42A mutant rSK1–59 (5 μg/ml) were mixed together with rSKΔ59 (10 μg/ml) or kept separate for 1 h. The microtiter plates were coated with the individual or complexed proteins for 1 h. After blocking with 1% BSA (1 h) and washing, various conformation-dependent and -independent mAb hybridoma supernatants were added for 1 h. Bound mAb was detected by γ-counting as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The goal of these studies was to identify the potential mechanisms through which SK residues 24–59 play a critical role in fibrin-independent Pg activation (11Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In a crystal structure of the activator complex, SK Glu-39 and Phe-37 were projected to interact with plasmin (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Our mutagenesis experiments confirm that these residues play a functional role in Pg activation. After these residues is the fibronectin motif that begins at the end of β2 and continues into an unstructured loop (beginning at residue 46 through residue 70). These sequences do not have intermolecular contacts with microplasmin in the activator complex (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Still, mutation of Leu-42 in the fibronectin motif appeared to cause a nearly selective defect in the ability of SK to serve as a cofactor for the binding and processing of Pg substrate because 1) it reduced the ability of the SK-plasmin complex to activate Pg and 2) it caused a significant (50-fold) decrease in thek cat for Pg activation but only slightly affected the k cat for amidolysis (∼1.5-fold). Investigation of the mechanism underlying the defect in the L42A mutant revealed the roles played by SK1–59 in fibrin-independent Pg activation. We found that both the native rSK1–59 and rSK1–59L42A bound comparably in a saturable and specific fashion to Glu-Pg. In addition, both native rSK1–59 and rSK1–59L42A simultaneously bound to immobilized Glu-Pg and125I-Glu-Pg in a sandwich assay, indicating that both molecules have at least two intact Pg binding sites. Native rSK1–59 and rSK1–59L42A also bound indistinguishably in a saturable and specific fashion to the remainder of the SK molecule, rSKΔ59. However, studies with conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies showed that the binding interactions of native SK1–59 with rSKΔ59 largely reconstituted the native structure of the A domain of SK, whereas the binding of rSK1–59L42A to rSKΔ59 did not. Thus the interactions of SK1–59 with rSKΔ59 induced structural changes that restored the ability of SK to bind Pg substrate either through direct interactions with the structured A domain or indirectly through other sites. A direct effect on substrate binding by the A domain appears to be the best explanation for two reasons. This domain recapitulates in sequence and size the structure of staphylokinase, a Pg activator that acts as a cofactor for binding Pg substrate for processing by plasmin (27Parry M.A. Fernandez-Catalan C. Bergner A. Huber R. Hopfner K.P. Schlott B. Guhrs K.H. Bode W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, in modeling studies with the activator complex, the A domain is projected to have the most extensive binding contacts with Pg substrate (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Unlike the other residues in the fibronectin motif, Leu-42 is one of the few residues conserved among different SKs isolated from humans, pigs, and horses (28Caballero A.R. Lottenberg R. Johnston K.H. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6478-6486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the streptokinase-plasmin complex revealed that there was no interaction of Leu-42 with microplasmin. The side chain of Leu-42 was oriented inward and appeared to contribute to the packing of the hydrophobic core of the protein through hydrophobic side chain interactions with Leu-18, Leu-74, Leu-127, Phe-135, and Ile-40 (Fig.6) (29Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. McNutt M. Gajiwala K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Mutation of a packed Leu residue to Ala significantly affects the thermal stability of the protein (30Moitra J. Szilak L. Krylov D. Vinson C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12567-12573Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although not directly shown in this study, it is possible to infer from crystal structure data that Leu-18, Ile-40, and Leu-42 participate in the formation of a type of a non-classical leucine zipper (i.e. “non-zipper”) interaction with Leu-74 and Leu-79 (31Hirst J.D. Vieth M. Skolnick J. Brooks III, C.L. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 562-657Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This hydrophobic interaction may be responsible for maintaining the association of the A1 and A2 subdomains after proteolytic cleavage of the A domain during Pg activation. Without the Leu-42 interaction, the A domain may not structure properly to permit optimal positioning of residues involved in direct contact with Pg substrate. Other studies have suggested that the SK NH2 terminus is involved in binding Pg substrate. For example, a monoclonal antibody against the NH2 terminus of SK inhibited Pg activation but not amidolytic activity (23Reed G.L. Kussie P. Parhami-Seren B. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 4407-4415PubMed Google Scholar, 24Parhami-Seren B. Keel T. Reed G.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The fibronectin motif sequence L42TSRPA47 has been implicated in Pg binding because of its homology to a fragment of fibronectin that binds to plasmin (13Gonzalez G.M. Enghild J.J. Pizzo S.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1180: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A docking interaction between kringle 5 of substrate Pg and residues 45–50 of SK (in the activator complex) has been projected in computer-assisted structural models (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In support of this, Pg does bind to an immobilized peptide mimic of SK residues 37–51 (33Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the fibronectin motif does not appear to be the binding site because replacement of the LTSRP sequence with alanines does not eliminate binding (33Nihalani D. Kumar R. Rajagopal K. Sahni G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have found that mutation of Leu-42 and Thr-43 does not alter Pg binding and that mutation of Arg-45 (not shown) does not reduce Pg activation. Thus the residues responsible for Pg substrate binding in the NH2-terminal peptide remain unidentified. The results of these experiments may help to resolve the apparent contradictions in the literature about the role of the NH2terminus in Pg activation (11Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Liu L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 15Parrado J. Conejero-Lara F. Smith R.A. Marshall J.M. Ponting C.P.

Because the A1 and A2 subdomains interact relatively slowly to restructure the A domain and to restore Pg activation, the effects of this interaction will be significantly influenced by experimental conditions such as time, temperature, and stoichiometry. Another explanation for previous experimental differences is the multiple roles played by the NH2 terminus of SK in Pg activation. The NH2-terminal Ile participates in the non-proteolytic activation of Pg through a chymotrypsinogen-like activation mechanism (7Wang S. Reed G.L. Hedstrom L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5232-5240Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The present experiments provide functional evidence that the NH2-terminal peptide of SK influences fibrin-independent Pg activation through at least three other mechanisms, as follows: 1) SK residues Phe-37 and Glu-39 play an important role in interacting with Pg* or plasmin moiety in the activator complex (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), 2) SK1–59 contains two Pg binding sites and appears capable of binding both the plasmin or Pg moiety in the activator complex and another Pg molecule in a potential substrate-docking interaction, and 3) SK 1–59 interacts with the A2 subdomain to restore the native structure of the A domain, so as to permit additional interactions between the activator complex and Pg substrate, which have been projected by structural modeling (12Wang X. Lin X. Loy J.A. Tang J. Zhang X.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1662-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar)."
https://openalex.org/W2166064475,"The GTPase-associated center in 23/28 S rRNA is one of the most conserved functional domains throughout all organisms. We detected a unique sequence of this domain in <i>Bombyx mori</i>species in which the bases at positions 1094 and 1098 (numbering from<i>Escherichia coli</i> 23 S rRNA) are C and G instead of the otherwise universally conserved bases U and A, respectively. These changes were also observed in four other species of moths, but not in organisms other than the moths. Characteristics of the <i>B. mori</i> rRNA domain were investigated by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using RNA fragments containing residues 1030–1128. Although two bands of protein-free RNA appeared on gel, they shifted to a single band when bound to <i>Bombyx</i> ribosomal proteins Bm-L12 and Bm-P complex, equivalent to <i>E. coli</i> L11 and L8, respectively. <i>Bombyx</i> RNA showed lower binding capacity than rat RNA for the ribosomal proteins and anti-28 S autoantibody, specific for a folded structure of the eukaryotic GTPase-associated domain. When the C<sup>1094</sup>/G<sup>1098</sup>bases in <i>Bombyx</i> RNA were replaced by the conserved U/A bases, the protein-free RNA migrated as a single band, and the complex formation with Bm-L12, Bm-P complex, and anti-28 S autoantibody was comparable to that of rat RNA. The results suggest that the GTPase-associated domain of moth-type insects has a labile structural feature that is caused by an unusual covariant change of the U<sup>1094</sup>/A<sup>1098</sup> bases to C/G."
https://openalex.org/W1999057288,"One of the mechanisms proposed to explain the anti-inflammatory activity of sodium salicylate (NaSal) is based, at least in part, on its ability to inhibit nuclear factor-κB activation and inhibition of nuclear factor-κB-dependent gene expression. On the other hand, little is known about the ability of NaSal to activate gene expression. By differential display reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we identified several genes that are modulated upon treatment of mouse fibroblasts with NaSal. From the various cDNA fragments recovered from autoradiograms, we found that NaSal can increase the levels of mRNA for biglycan, the mouse homologue of the human eIF-3 p47 unit, and immunophilin FKBP51. NaSal-induced expression of these genes was time- and dose-dependent. Moreover,FKBP51 gene expression was augmented in vivo, in mice treated orally or intraperitoneally with NaSal. We also found that treating cells with NaSal can inhibit the expression of the p34 cdc2 kinase. The impact this inhibition on cell cycle was evaluated by measuring the content of DNA during the cell cycle. Treatment of cells with NaSal led to a G2/M arrest. By investigating the signaling events that regulate the expression of these genes and their biological activities, we can contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of NaSal."
