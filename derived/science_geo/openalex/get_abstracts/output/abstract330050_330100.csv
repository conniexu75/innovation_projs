https://openalex.org/W2112790930,"Granular materials display a variety of behaviors that are in many ways different from those of other substances. They cannot be easily classified as either solids or liquids. This has prompted the generation of analogies between the physics found in a simple sandpile and that found in complicated microscopic systems, such as flux motion in superconductors or spin glasses. Recently, the unusual behavior of granular systems has led to a number of new theories and to a new era of experimentation on granular systems."
https://openalex.org/W1987359980,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is the largest reservoir of reduced carbon in the oceans. The nature of DOM is poorly understood, in part, because it has been difficult to isolate sufficient amounts of representative material for analysis. Tangential-flow ultrafiltration was shown to recover milligram amounts of >1000 daltons of DOM from seawater collected at three depths in the North Pacific Ocean. These isolates represented 22 to 33 percent of the total DOM and included essentially all colloidal material. The elemental, carbohydrate, and carbon-type (by (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance) compositions of the isolates indicated that the relative abundance of polysaccharides was high ( approximately 50 percent) in surface water and decreased to approximately 25 percent in deeper samples. Polysaccharides thus appear to be more abundant and reactive components of seawater DOM than has been recognized."

As subduction continues and the slab shallows, a basin depocenter and forebulge migrate in toward the continental interior. Finally, closure of the ocean basin leads to regional uplift. These active margin processes have commonly been ascribed to supracrustal loading, but numerical modeling shows that dynamic subsidence rates can exceed 100 meters per million years and are similar to rates of sediment accumulation along convergent North American plate margins over the Phanerozoic."

In response, new ways to detect explosives and to combine techniques based on different phenomena into integrated security systems are being developed to improve aviation security. Several leading methods for explosives and weapons detection are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2034595141,"Spectra obtained from recent telescopic observation of 1-Ceres and laboratory measurements and theoretical calculations of three component mixtures of Ceres analog material suggest that an ammoniated phyllosilicate is present on the surface of the asteroid, rather than H2O frost as had been previously reported. The presence of an ammoniated phyllosilicate, most likely ammoniated saponite, on the surface of Ceres implies that secondary temperatures could not have exceeded 400 kelvin."
https://openalex.org/W1991629868,"Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the mechanism of the structural memory effect in alpha-berlinite (AlPO(4)), where a single crystal transforms to an amorphous solid by compression and then reverts to the original crystalline structure upon release of pressure. The enhanced oxygen coordination around the aluminum atoms in AlPO(4) at high pressure leads to a mechanical instability that causes the phase transformation. The difference in the structural memory behavior between AlPO(4) and isostructural alpha-quartz, for which the pressure-induced amorphized phase is recoverable, can be attributed to the presence of the PO(4) units, which remain essentially four-coordinated even when severely distorted."
https://openalex.org/W2031368959,"Free calcium (Ca(2+)) in the cytoplasm of plant cells is important for the regulation of many cellular processes and the transduction of stimuli. Control of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) involves the activity of pumps, carriers, and possibly ion channels. The patch-clamp technique was used to study Ca(2+) channels in the vacuole of sugar beet cells. Vacuolar currents showed inward rectification at negative potentials, with a single-channel conductance of 40 picosiemens and an open probability dependent on potential. Channels were inhibited by verapamil and lanthanum. These channels could participate in the regulation of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) by sequestering Ca(2+) inside the vacuole."

https://openalex.org/W2094909607,"As hydrothermal fluid ascends through a network of cracks into cooler crust, heat is transferred from the fluid to the adjacent rock. The thermal stresses caused by this heating close cracks that are more or less vertical. This heating may affect network connections and destroy the permeable crack network. Thermoelastic stresses caused by a temperature difference of ∼100°C can decrease the interconnectivity of a crack network to the percolation threshold. If the temperature is slightly less, thermoelastic stresses may focus the discharge in hydrothermal systems into discrete vents."
https://openalex.org/W1971044793,"In late December 1990, a new radio source appeared near the center of our galaxy rivaling the intensity of Sgr A(*) (the compact radio source at the galactic center). Following its first detection, the flux density of the galactic center transient (GCT) increased rapidly to a maximum 1 month later, and then declined gradually with a time scale of about 3 months. Surprisingly, the GCT maintained a steep radio spectrum during both its rising and decay phases. The neutral hydrogen (HI) absorption shows similar absorption to that in front of Sgr A(*); this indicates that the GCT lies near the galactic center. Furthermore, both HI and OH observations show an additional deep absorption at +20 kilometers per second with respect to the local standard of rest. Thus, the GCT is either embedded in or located behind a molecular cloud moving with that velocity. The cloud can be seen on infrared images. Its opacity is shown to be inadequate to conceal a supernova near the galactic center. It is argued that the GCT was probably transient radio emission from synchrotron-radiating plasma associated with an x-ray binary system."
https://openalex.org/W2006143217,"Detonation of fission-type nuclear devices results in an inner circle of complete denudation of desert shrub vegetation, often about 0.5 mi in radius, surrounded by a zone of partial and selective destruction which is variable in width. The gross injury to vegetation appears to be attributable to mechanical and thermal effects. Successional change in the composition of the vegetation, due to invasion by plants of pioneer character, is taking place in all disturbed areas."
https://openalex.org/W2040153587,"Calculations of radiative equilibrium temperatures on Triton's rough surface suggest that significant condensation of N(2) may be occurring in the northern equatorial regions, despite their relatively dark appearance. The bright frost is not apparent in the Voyager images because it tends to be concentrated in relatively unilluminated facets of the surface. This patchwork of bright frost-covered regions and darker bare ground may be distributed on scales smaller than that of the Voyager resolution; as a result the northern equatorial regions may appear relatively dark. This hypothesis also accounts for the observed wind direction in the southern hemisphere because it implies that the equatorial regions are warmer than the south polar regions."
