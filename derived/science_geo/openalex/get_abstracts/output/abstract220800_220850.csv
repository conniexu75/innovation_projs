https://openalex.org/W2131765244,"Growth of the yeast species Candida albicans and Pichia pastoris is inhibited by RsAFP2, a plant defensin isolated from radish seed (Raphanus sativus), at micromolar concentrations. In contrast, gcs-deletion mutants of both yeast species are resistant toward RsAFP2. GCS genes encode UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferases, which catalyze the final step in the biosynthesis of the membrane lipid glucosylceramide. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay, RsAFP2 was found to interact with glucosylceramides isolated from P. pastoris but not with soybean nor human glucosylceramides. Furthermore, the P. pastoris parental strain is sensitive toward RsAFP2-induced membrane permeabilization, whereas the corresponding gcs-deletion mutant is highly resistant to RsAFP2-mediated membrane permeabilization. A model for the mode of action of RsAFP2 is presented in which all of these findings are linked. Similarly to RsAFP2, heliomicin, a defensin-like peptide from the insect Heliothis virescens, is active on C. albicans and P. pastoris parental strains but displays no activity on the gcs-deletion mutants of both yeast species. Furthermore, heliomicin interacts with glucosylceramides isolated from P. pastoris and soybean but not with human glucosylceramides. These data indicate that structurally homologous anti-fungal peptides present in species from different eukaryotic kingdoms interact with the same target in the fungal plasma membrane, namely glucosylceramides, and as such support the hypothesis that defensins from plants and insects have evolved from a single precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1985177783,"When a female is sexually promiscuous, the ejaculates of different males compete for the fertilization of her eggs; the more sperm a male inseminates into a female, the more likely he is to fertilize her eggs. Because sperm production is limited and costly, theory predicts that males will strategically allocate sperm (1) according to female promiscuity, (2) saving some for copulations with new females, and (3) to females producing more and/or better offspring. Whether males allocate sperm in all of these ways is not known, particularly in birds where the collection of natural ejaculates only recently became possible. Here we demonstrate male sperm allocation of unprecedented sophistication in the fowl Gallus gallus. Males show status-dependent sperm investment in females according to the level of female promiscuity; they progressively reduce sperm investment in a particular female but, on encountering a new female, instantaneously increase their sperm investment; and they preferentially allocate sperm to females with large sexual ornaments signalling superior maternal investment. Our results indicate that female promiscuity leads to the evolution of sophisticated male sexual behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2081921364,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive, rapidly metastasizing neoplasm. The chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) is constitutively secreted by marrow stromal cells and plays a key role for homing of hematopoietic cells to the marrow. Here, we report that tumor cells from patients with SCLC express high levels of functional CXCR4 receptors for the chemokine CXCL12. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry demonstrated CXCR4 mRNA and CXCR4 surface expression in SCLC cell lines. Immunohistochemistry of primary tumor samples from SCLC patients revealed high expression of CXCR4. CXCL12 elicited CXCR4 receptor endocytosis, actin polymerization, and a robust activation of phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase in SCLC cells. Furthermore, CXCL12 induced SCLC cell invasion into extracellular matrix and firm adhesion to marrow stromal cells. Stromal cell adhesion of SCLC cells was significantly inhibited by the specific CXCR4 antagonist T140, pertussis toxin, antivascular cell adhesion molecule-1(VCAM-1) antibodies, and CS-1 peptide, demonstrating the importance of CXCR4 chemokine receptor activation and alpha4beta1 integrin binding, respectively. In addition, CXCL12 enhanced the adhesion of SCLC cells to immobilized VCAM-1, demonstrating that CXCR4 chemokine receptors can induce integrin activation on SCLC cells. As SCLC has a high propensity for bone marrow involvement, our findings suggest that CXCR4 chemokine receptors and alpha4beta1 integrins play a critical role in the interaction of SCLC cells with stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2005296060,"The STAT-1 transcription factor has been implicated as a tumor suppressor by virtue of its ability to inhibit cell growth and promoting apoptosis. However, the mechanisms by which STAT-1 mediates these effects remain unclear. Using human and mouse STAT-1-deficient cells, we show here that STAT-1 is required for optimal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The basal level of the p53 inhibitor Mdm2 is increased in STAT-1(-/-) cells, suggesting that STAT-1 is a negative regulator of Mdm2 expression. Correspondingly, both basal p53 levels, and those induced by DNA damage were lower in STAT-1(-/-) cells. In agreement with this lower p53 response to DNA damage in cells lacking STAT-1, the induction of p53 responsive genes, such as Bax, Noxa, and Fas, was reduced in STAT-1-deficient cells. Conversely, STAT-1 overexpression enhances transcription of these genes, an effect that is abolished if the p53 response element in their promoters is mutated. Moreover, STAT-1 interacts directly with p53, an association, which is enhanced following DNA damage. Therefore, in addition to negatively regulating Mdm2, STAT-1 also acts as a coactivator for p53. Hence STAT-1 is another member of a growing family of protein partners able to modulate the p53-activated apoptotic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2045631507,"Apigenin is a low toxicity and non-mutagenic phytopolyphenol and protein kinase inhibitor. It exhibits anti-proliferating effects on human breast cancer cells. Here we examined several human breast cancer cell lines having different levels of HER2/neu expression and found that apigenin exhibited potent growth-inhibitory activity in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells but was much less effective for those cells expressing basal levels of HER2/neu. Induction of apoptosis was also observed in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, the one or more molecular mechanisms of apigenin-induced apoptosis in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells remained to be elucidated. A cell survival pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and Akt is known to play an important role in inhibiting apoptosis in response to HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells, which prompted us to investigate whether this pathway plays a role in apigenin-induced apoptosis in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Our results showed that apigenin inhibits Akt function in tumor cells in a complex manner. First, apigenin directly inhibited the PI3K activity while indirectly inhibiting the Akt kinase activity. Second, inhibition of HER2/neu autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation resulting from depleting HER2/neu protein in vivo was also observed. In addition, apigenin inhibited Akt kinase activity by preventing the docking of PI3K to HER2/HER3 heterodimers. Therefore, we proposed that apigenin-induced cellular effects result from loss of HER2/neu and HER3 expression with subsequent inactivation of PI3K and AKT in cells that are dependent on this pathway for cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. This implies that the inhibition of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer function provided an especially effective strategy for blocking the HER2/neu-mediated transformation of breast cancer cells. Our results also demonstrated that apigenin dissociated the complex of HER2/neu and GRP94 that preceded the depletion of HER2/neu. Apigenin-induced degradation of mature HER2/neu involves polyubiquitination of HER2/neu and subsequent hydrolysis by the proteasome.

Several cancers, including breast cancer, have a lower incidence in Asia than in Western countries (1Rose D.P. Boyar A.P. Wynder E.L. Cancer. 1986; 58: 2363-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). This may be attributed to the Asian dietary regimen rich in flavonoid-containing plants, which are thought to be anti-tumorigenic. Among the plant flavonoids, apigenin (4′,5,7,-trihydroxyflavone) is a chemopreventive compound (2Kuo M.L. Lee K.C. Lin J.K. Mutat.

It has low toxicity, is non-mutagenic, and is widely distributed in many fruits and vegetables, including parsley, onions, oranges, tea, chamomile, wheat sprouts, and in some seasonings (5Birt D.F.

Apigenin has been demonstrated to be a protein kinase inhibitor, and it achieves this inhibitory effect by competing with ATP (14Geahlen R.L. Koonchanok N.M. McLaughlin J.L. J. Nat.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the Western world and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women (16Greenle R.T. Hill-Harmon M.B. Thun M. CA Cancer J. Clin. 2001; 51: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). Gene amplification and/or overexpression of some oncogenes have been implicated in breast cancers. HER2/neu (also known as ErbB2) is among the most characterized oncogenes linked with poor prognosis in breast cancer (17Slamon D. Clark M. Wong S. Levin W. Ullrich A. McAuire W. Science. 1987; 235: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HER2/neu is found in ∼30% of human breast cancers and correlates with more aggressive tumors and more resistance to cancer chemotherapy (18Menard S. Tagliabue E. Campiglio M. Pupa S.M. J. Cell Physiol. 2000; 182: 150-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). An increase in HER2/neu expression also enhances malignant phenotypes of cancer cells, including those with metastatic potential (19Yu D.H. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 1991-1996PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yu D.H. Wang S.S. Dulski K.M. Nicolson G.L. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3150-3156Google Scholar, 21Yusa K. Sugimot Y. Yamori T. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Tsuruo T. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1632-1635Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The association of HER2/neu overexpression in cancer cells with chemoresistance and metastasis provides a plausible interpretation for the poor clinical outcome of patients with HER2/neu-overexpressing cancers; it suggests that the enhanced tyrosine kinase activity of HER2/neu might play a critical role in the initiation, progression, and outcome of human tumors. HER2/neu is a member of the class II receptor (ErbB) tyrosine kinase family, which in human includes the HER1 (epidermal growth factor receptor, ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), HER3 (ErbB3), and HER4 (ErbB4). ErbB receptors are essential mediators of cell proliferation and differentiation. Their aberrant activation is associated with the development and severity of many cancers. Homo- and hetero-dimerization of ErbB receptors result in a wide variety of cellular signal transduction. Dimerization of HER2/neu and HER3 occurs frequently and is a preferred heterodimer (22Olayioye M.A. Neve R.M. Lane H.A. Hynes N.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3159-3167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HER2/HER3 dimer constitutes a high affinity co-receptor for heregullin, which is capable of potent mitogenic signaling (23Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). HER3 is a kinase-defective protein that is phosphorylated by HER2/neu. Tyrosine-phosphorylated HER3 is able to directly couple to PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), a lipid kinase involved in the proliferation, survival, adhesion, and motility of tumor cells (24Fedi P. Pierce J.H. di Fiore P.P. Kraus M.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 492-500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Prigent S.A. Gullick W.J.

Kim M.S. Koland J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42153-42161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Activation of PI3K and the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate in vivo are necessary for the activation of Akt/PKB, a downstream mediator of PI3K signaling, through phosphorylation of Thr-308 and Ser-473 by PDK1 and PDK2/integrin-linked kinase (28Downward J. Science. 1998; 279: 673-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In numerous cell types, it has been shown that Akt/PKB induces survival and suppresses apoptosis induced by a variety of stimuli, including growth factor withdrawal and loss of cell adhesion. The mechanisms by which Akt/PKB regulates cell survival involve the phosphorylation and inactivation of the apoptotic mediators BAD (29Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y.

Akt/PKB is also involved in regulating cell proliferation (34Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies performed in animal model have shown that downregulating HER2/neu by repressing the HER2/neu promoter (36Xing X. Matin A. Yu D. Xia W. Sorgi F. Huang L. Hung M.C.

One therapeutic approach that has already reached clinical application is the use of an unarmed monoclonal antibody called Trastuzumab (Herceptin™) (43Pegram M. Slamon D. Semin. Oncol. 2000; 27: 13-19PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have attributed the therapeutic potential of anti-HER2/neu antibodies to their ability to enhance intracellular degradation of the cell surface-localized oncoprotein (44Kasprzyk P.G. Song S.U. Di Fiore P.P. King C.R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2771-2776PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that manipulating HER2/neu may be of substantial value in the treatment of breast cancer. Apigenin has been shown to efficiently inhibit the growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast carcinoma cell lines, and its growth inhibitory effects are mediated by targeting different signal transduction pathways (8Yin F. Giuliano A.E. Law R.E. Van Herle A.J. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 413-420PubMed Google Scholar). However, MCF-7 and MDAMB-468 express only basal levels of HER2/neu. Here, we investigated the effectiveness of apigenin against a series of breast cancer cells having different levels of HER2/neu expression. We showed that apigenin efficiently inhibited the growth of MDAMB-453 HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Induction of apoptosis was also observed in these HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. In addition, to elucidate the molecular mechanism of apigenin-induced apoptosis in HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells, the apoptotic machinery and the expression of several cell survival genes were investigated. We demonstrated that HER2/neu was degraded in MDA-MB-453 HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells by proteasomal degradation, and that the inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis by apigenin may be through suppression of HER2/HER3 signaling and disruption of the PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway. Cell Culture—The human breast cancer cell lines used in this study were MDA-MB-453, BT-474, and SKBr-3, all of which overexpress HER2/neu, and MCF-7, which expresses the basal level of HER2/neu. We also used HBL-100 cell line, which is derived from a normal human breast tissue transformed by SV40 large T antigen and expresses a basal level of HER2/neu. All of the cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and gentamicin (50 mg/ml). Cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. Cell Transfection—The plasmid pSV2-erbB2, a constitutive expression vector, carries the 4.4-kb full-length human HER2/neu cDNA under the control of the SV40 promoter/enhancer sequence. Two million cells were transfected with 2 μg of DNA mediated by 10 μl of Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen). Experiments were performed 24 h after transfection. Western Blot Analysis—The cells (1.5 × 106) were seeded onto a 100-mm tissue culture dish in 10% FBS DMEM/F-12 and cultured for 24 h. The cells were then incubated in 1% FBS DMEM/F-12 treating with various dose of apigenin for various time periods. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then lysed in gold lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 137 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Protein content was determined against a standardized control, using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories). A total of 50 μg of protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filter paper (Schleicher & Schuell, Inc., Keene, NH). Nonspecific binding on the nitrocellulose filter paper was minimized with a blocking buffer containing nonfat dry milk (5%) and Tween 20 (0.1%, v/v) in PBS (PBS/Tween 20). Then the filter paper was incubated with primary antibodies followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:2500 dilution, Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Reactive bands were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Arlington Heights, IL). The intensity of the bands was scanned and quantified with National Institutes of Health Image software. In Vitro HER2/neu Tyrosine Kinase Assay—Immunocomplex was precipitated from lysate of MDA-MB-453 cells with monoclonal anti-HER2/neu antibody c-neu (Ab-3) on protein-A-conjugated agarose beads (40 μl) (Roche Applied Science) and then washed three times with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl (pH 7.5) and once in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm MnCl2). Radiolabeled ATP (10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, Amersham Biosciences) and 10 μl of enolase (2.5 mg/ml, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) were added to the beads, followed by incubation for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction products were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. In Vitro PI3K Assay—MDA-MB-453 cell extracts (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-PI3K(p85) antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Repligen). Immunoprecipitation complexes were washed three times with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS, twice with a buffer containing 0.5 m LiCl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, and twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Complexes were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 1 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences), and a 0.5 μm/ml lipid mix of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylserine (1:1) in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), and 1 mm EGTA. The reaction was quenched by 1 m HCl, and lipids were extracted with CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1). The organic layer was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography developed with 1-propanol:methanol:glacial acetic acid (50:15:35) and detected by autoradiography. In Vitro Akt Kinase Assay—Kinase activity was assayed using a New England Biolabs Akt Kinase Kit. Akt was immunoprecipitated, washed twice with lysis buffer, then twice with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). 200 μm ATP and 1 μg of substrate (paramyosin fused to a GSK-3 crosstide) were added, and assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min. Reaction mixtures were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the p-GSK-3 reaction product was detected by immunoblotting. In Vitro grp94 Autophosphorylation Assay—MDA-MB-453 cell extracts (500 μg) were immunoprecipitated with GRP94 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Mixtures were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C, and then 40 μl of protein-A-conjugated agarose beads was added. After rotation at 4 °C for overnight, immunocomplexes were washed 5 times with 800 μl each of a washing buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) and finally resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Ten μl of the immunocomplex beads was incubated in a buffer containing 30 mm Hepes, 400 kBq of 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP, pH 7.5, in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 or MgCl2 at 37 °C for 30 min with occasional mixings. The reaction was terminated by adding 5× SDS sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The proteins eluted from the immunoaffinity resins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Pulse-chase Labeling Assay—MDA-MB-453 cells were grown to 70% confluence in 100-mm dishes in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Plates were washed and then incubated in DMEM lacking methionine and cysteine for 20 min and then pulsed for 30 min in 1 ml of deficient media containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine (Trans-Label, ICN). After pulsing, plates were washed once in complete media and then incubated in complete media containing either 40 μm apigenin or vehicle control (0.l% Me2SO). After incubation, plates were washed three times in PBS, and the cells were lysed in gold lysis buffer. Cell lysates were cleared by a 10-min spin at 12,000 × g, and then an equal amount of protein (500 μg) was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody Ab-3 as described above. Immunocomplexes were separated by 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and visualized by fluorography. Immunofluorescence Assay—MDA-MB-453 cells were plated on coverslips placed in six-well plates. Experiments were performed 24 h after cell attachment. Cells were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 10–15 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with PBS for 2–3 times followed by blocking with 1% normal goat serum for 30 min. Incubations were performed with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer at 4 °C for overnight, after which coverslips were washed and incubated for 30 min with the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Coverslips were washed and mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and viewed under a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany). MTT Assay—Cells were seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate (1 × 104 cells/well) overnight, then treated with varying concentrations of apigenin, and incubated for an additional 72 h. The effect of apigenin on cell growth was examined by the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Briefly, 20 μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml, Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to each well and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The supernatant was aspirated, and the MTT-formazan crystals formed by metabolically viable cells were dissolved in 200 μl of Me2SO. Finally, the absorbance was monitored by a microplate reader at a wavelength of 595 nm. DNA Extraction and Electrophoretic Analysis—Cells (4 × 105 cells/ml) were harvested, washed in PBS, and then lysed by digestion buffer containing 0.5% Sarkosyl, 0.5% mg/ml proteinase K, 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), and 10 mm EDTA at 55 °C for 3 h. RNase A (0.5 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 24 h, after which the DNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Approximately 20 μg of DNA was loaded in each well, and electrophoresed into a 1.8% agarose gel (containing ethidium bromide) at 50 V for 120 min. The gel was then visualized under a UV light and photographed. Flow Cytometry—Cells (2 × 105) were cultured in 60-mm Petri dishes and incubated for various times. Then cells were harvested, washed with PBS, resuspended in 200 μl of PBS, and fixed in 800 μl of iced 100% ethanol at -20 °C. After being left to stand overnight, cell pellets were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS and 0.5 μg/ml RNase), and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then 1 ml of propidium iodide solution (50 μg/ml) was added, and the mixture was allowed to stand on ice for 30 min. Fluorescence emitted from the propidium iodide-DNA complex was quantitated after excitation of the fluorescent dye by FAC-Scan cytometry (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Apigenin Preferentially Inhibited the Proliferation of HER2/neu-overexpressing Breast Cancer Cells—The growth of the tested cell lines was inhibited by apigenin in a dose-dependent manner but to varying extents (Fig. 1). At a 40 μm concentration, apigenin blocked 48% of growth in HER2/neu-overexpressing MDA-MB-453 cells. However, under the same conditions, it inhibited only 31%of growth in MCF7 (basal HER2/neu levels). Apigenin had little effect on the immortalized non-cancerous HBL-100 breast cell line even at 70 μm. These results suggest that apigenin preferentially suppresses growth of the HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines. Apigenin Induced Apoptosis in the HER2/neu-overexpressing Breast Cancer Cells—Apigenin-treated MDA-MB-453 cell lines underwent apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner as measured by flow cytometry using propidium-iodide staining (Fig. 2A). A significant number of the cells (55.37%) started to undergo apoptosis as early as 36 h after treatment with 40 μm apigenin. A lower concentration of apigenin (20 μm) resulted in apoptosis in fewer cells (∼20% at 36 h). As shown in Fig. 2B,by comparing with vehicle control, apigenin treatment (20 and 40 μm for 48 h) resulted in DNA fragmentations in MDA-MB-453 cells. Similarly, treatment with apigenin at 40 μm for 24 and 48 h resulted in the formation of a DNA ladder. Apigenin Inhibited PI3K Activity and Akt Kinase in HER2/neu-overexpressing Breast Cancer Cells—A key mechanism by which HER2/neu overexpression stimulates tumor cell growth and renders cells chemoresistant is through the HER2/neu receptor. This mechanism involves the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, and human breast cancer cells with overexpression and amplification of HER2/neu have been shown to make increased use of the signaling pathway mediated by PI3K/Akt (17Slamon D. Clark M. Wong S. Levin W. Ullrich A. McAuire W. Science. 1987; 235: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (10014) Google Scholar, 45Yokota J. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Terada M. Sugimura T. Battifora H. Cline M.J. Lancet. 1986; 1: 765-767Abstract PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Activated Akt is considered the focal point of a survival pathway known to protect cells from apoptosis by several stimuli, whereas in a recent report, apigenin displayed potent inhibitory effects on PI3K activity (46Agullo G. Gamet-Payrastre L. Manenti S. Viala C. Remesy C. Chap H. Payrastre B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 53: 1649-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, our results also indicated that apigenin possessed inhibitory effects on PI3K activity in the HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that in the HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453, BT-474, and SKBr-3, treatment with apigenin had no effect on steady-state levels of total PI3K protein, whereas its downstream effector of phosphorylated Akt was inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Wortmannin and LY294002 are known to be irreversible PI3K inhibitors and were used here as positive controls (Fig. 3B). Treatment of the HER2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines with wortmannin almost completely inhibited Akt phosphorylation at 2 h, whereas the reduced inhibition at 16 h post-treatment (Fig. 3B) is presumably attributable to wortmannin having a relatively short half-life. Akt kinase has been shown to phosphorylate several key substrates that regulate protein translation, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation (47Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 355-358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 48Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of its substrate, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), was demonstrated here in MDA-MB-453 cells (Fig. 3C). Apigenin caused dephosphorylation of GSK-3 at concentrations associated with inhibition of Akt activation, but at the same time, treatment with apigenin had no effect on steady-state levels of total Akt kinase protein (Fig. 3C). To test whether apigenin directly inhibited the Akt kinase, Akt was immunoprecipitated from untreated MDAMB-453 cells. After treatment of the precipitates with various concentrations of apigenin, measurement of the Akt kinase activity showed that apigenin have"
https://openalex.org/W1624569638,"The concept of quasiparticles in solid-state physics is an extremely powerful tool for describing complex many-body phenomena in terms of single-particle excitations. Introducing a simple particle, such as an electron, hole or phonon, deforms a many-body system through its interactions with other particles. In this way, the added particle is 'dressed' or 'renormalized' by a self-energy cloud that describes the response of the many-body system, so forming a new entity--the quasiparticle. Using ultrafast laser techniques, it is possible to impulsively generate bare particles and observe their subsequent dressing by the many-body interactions (that is, quasiparticle formation) on the time and energy scales governed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Here we describe the coherent response of silicon to excitation with a 10-femtosecond (10(-14) s) laser pulse. The optical pulse interacts with the sample by way of the complex second-order nonlinear susceptibility to generate a force on the lattice driving coherent phonon excitation. Transforming the transient reflectivity signal into frequency-time space reveals interference effects leading to the coherent phonon generation and subsequent dressing of the phonon by electron-hole pair excitations."
https://openalex.org/W2034059681,"The RAS association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) gene is silenced by DNA methylation in over 50% of all solid tumors of different histological types. However, the biochemical function of the RASSF1A protein is unknown. We show that RASSF1A colocalizes with microtubules in interphase and decorates spindles and centrosomes during mitosis. RASSF1A has a strong cytoprotective activity against the microtubule-destabilizing drug nocodazole, and against cold-treatment in vivo. Conversely, loss of RASSF1 in RASSF1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts renders the cells more sensitive to nocodazole-induced depolymerization of microtubules. The domain required for both microtubule association and stabilization was mapped to a 169 amino-acid fragment that contains the RAS association domain. Overexpression of RASSF1A induces mitotic arrest at metaphase with aberrant mitotic cells reminiscent of such produced by the microtubule-stabilizing drug paclitaxel (taxol), including monopolar spindles, or complete lack of a mitotic spindle. Altered microtubule stability in cells lacking RASSF1A is likely to affect spindle assembly and chromosome attachment, processes that need to be carefully controlled to protect cells from genomic instability and transformation. In addition, knowledge of the microtubule-targeting function of RASSF1 may aid in the development of new anticancer drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2003491070,"Steroid hormones fulfil important functions in animal development. In Drosophila, ecdysone triggers moulting and metamorphosis through its effects on gene expression. Ecdysone works by binding to a nuclear receptor, EcR, which heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor homologue Ultraspiracle. Both partners are required for binding to ligand or DNA. Like most DNA-binding transcription factors, nuclear receptors activate or repress gene expression by recruiting co-regulators, some of which function as chromatin-modifying complexes. For example, p160 class coactivators associate with histone acetyltransferases and arginine histone methyltransferases. The Trithorax-related gene of Drosophila encodes the SET domain protein TRR. Here we report that TRR is a histone methyltransferases capable of trimethylating lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3-K4). trr acts upstream of hedgehog (hh) in progression of the morphogenetic furrow, and is required for retinal differentiation. Mutations in trr interact in eye development with EcR, and EcR and TRR can be co-immunoprecipitated on ecdysone treatment. TRR, EcR and trimethylated H3-K4 are detected at the ecdysone-inducible promoters of hh and BR-C in cultured cells, and H3-K4 trimethylation at these promoters is decreased in embryos lacking a functional copy of trr. We propose that TRR functions as a coactivator of EcR by altering the chromatin structure at ecdysone-responsive promoters."

The conclusion that the open sea –– and therefore much of our planet's surface –– is in a net heterotrophic metabolic state2,3,4 is enigmatic and is a first-order question in the global carbon cycle, as discussed by del Giorgio and Duarte5. Our findings suggest that autotrophy in the open sea is episodic and decoupled from the more constant heterotrophic processes.

https://openalex.org/W2059477617,"The 5-hydroxytryptamine2c receptor (5-HT2cR) is subjected to RNA editing, in the second intracellular loop, generating 14 different isoforms in human brain. This post-transcriptional event markedly alters the signaling properties of the receptor by reducing its ability to couple to G-proteins. Although the non-edited form of the receptor is essentially fully constitutively active, edited forms show lesser degrees of constitutive activity. We have used two extensively edited receptor isoforms, VGV and VSV, and the non-edited INI isoform to investigate how variations in constitutive receptor activity affect the trafficking and the interaction of these isoforms with components of the desensitization machinery in HEK 293 cells. We found that cell surface expression of the 5-HT2cR decreased in parallel with increased constitutive activity of the isoforms. The subcellular distribution of the various isoforms was dependent of their ability to interact with βarrestin2, which correlated with the constitutive activity level of each isoform. We observed that the agonist-independent interaction of βarrestin2 with constitutively active 5-HT2cR isoforms was reversed by inverse agonist treatments promoting receptor redistribution to the cell surface. Overexpression of a G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2) was able to stabilize the interaction of βarrestin2 with constitutively active 5-HT2cR isoforms even in the presence of inverse agonists. Taken together, our observations indicate that the constitutively active 5-HT2cR isoforms are spontaneously internalized in an agonist-independent manner. This endocytosis process is mediated by a GRK/βarrestin-dependent mechanism and is directly correlated with the constitutive activity status of the RNA edited receptor variants. Thus the ultimate physiological output of constitutively active receptors may be determined not only by their agonist-independent activity but also by their interactions with GRKs and βarrestin.

Internalized receptor can then be recycled back to the plasma membrane with highly variable kinetics (resensitization) or be degraded (down-regulation) or both. However, beyond this classic receptor theory, it has been found that some receptors can exhibit constitutive activity, defined as a specific molecular conformation of the receptor that is able to signal in an agonist-independent fashion (6.Kjelsberg M.A. Cotecchia S.

Serotonin 2c (previously 5-HT1c) receptors belong to the rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs and interact with Gαq to stimulate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) (15.Chang M. Zhang L. Tam J.P. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7021-7029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The 5-HT2cR is known to exist naturally as several distinct protein isoforms secondary to RNA editing (16.Burns C.M. Chu H. Rueter S.M. Hutchinson L.K. Canton H. Sanders-Bush E. Emeson R.B.

RNA editing is mediated by adenosine desaminases that act on double-stranded RNA to convert up to five adenosines residues to inosines residues within the pre-mRNA of the 5-HT2cR, creating non-synonymous changes in amino acids 156, 158, and 160 (16.Burns C.M.

Interestingly, RNA editing takes place in the second intracellular loop region of the 5-HT2cR, starting two residues downstream of the DRY (Asp-Arg-Tyr) motif that is highly conserved among the GPCR family. This motif is suggested to play a critical role in agonist-induced receptor activation. Indeed, mutations of the aspartate residue in the DRY motif have been found to lead to constitutively active mutants of many GPCRs (19.Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D.

The unedited version of the 5-HT2cR displays a large degree of constitutive activity essentially being unresponsive to further agonist stimulation. Importantly, RNA editing of the 5-HT2cR has been shown to create receptor isoforms that display lesser degrees of constitutive signaling by severely reducing the G-protein coupling efficiency (23.Niswender C.M. Copeland S.C. Herrick-Davis K. Emeson R.B. Sanders-Bush E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9472-9478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Among the 14 5-HT2cR isoforms expressed in human brain, we have focused our study on three isoforms, the fully edited VGV, the partially edited VSV, and the unedited INI. The fully edited 5-HT2cR-VGV (Val156-Gly158-Val160) isoform displays the lowest level of constitutive activity and is essentially silent, requiring agonist stimulation to couple to PLC activation. The 5-HT2cR-VSV (Val156-Ser158-Val160), the predominant isoform expressed in human brain, displays modest constitutive activity, essentially 50% of that achieved by maximal activation of the receptor by the full agonist serotonin (5-HT). Finally, as stated above, the unedited 5-HT2cR-INI (Ile156-Asn158-Ile160)is the isoform that presents maximal levels of constitutive activity, approaching that achieved by serotonin (24.Price R.D.

Ther. 2001; 299: 268-271PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the 5-HT2cR is unique in that the natural isoform signals in a ligand-independent manner and that this property is attenuated by RNA editing. Previous studies have evaluated the signaling properties of the various 5-HT2cR isoforms based on inositol phosphate accumulation measurements and have also proposed that GRK2 can mediate desensitization of the 5-HT2cR (26.Sallese M. Mariggio S. D'Urbano E. Iacovelli L. De Blasi A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 27.Berg K.A. Stout B.D. Maayani S. Clarke W.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 299: 593-602PubMed Google Scholar). However, whether the differential intrinsic signaling properties of the various isoforms might influence or be mediated by interaction with βarrestins and subsequently influence their relative cellular localization have not yet been examined. In this report, we have used these three edited variants of the human 5-HT2cR to investigate how various levels of constitutive activity, resulting from naturally occurring amino acids modifications, influence the cellular distribution of these GPCRs. Furthermore, we examined if the 5HT2cR internalization was βarrestin-dependent and to what extend constitutive activity of the receptor could lead to an agonist-independent recruitment of the βarrestins. Thus, these various isoforms allow us to address the issue of whether constitutively active receptors are also constitutively desensitized and internalized.

The following primers were used: βarr2-5′, ACTGGAGCTCAAATGGGTGAAAAACCCGGGACC; and βarr2-3′, ACTGGGTACCGCAGAACTGGTCATCACAGTCGTC (underlined residues are restriction sites of SacI and KpnI). The PCR products were subcloned into the SacI-KpnI sites of pHC-Red-N1 (Clontech). The Golgi-YFP expression vector labeling the trans-Golgi network was from Clontech. The cDNA vector encoding the HA-tagged human Rab11a was a gift from SSG Ferguson. cDNA vectors for the 5-HT2C-INI, 5-HT2C-VSV, and 5-HT2C-VGV isoforms of the 5-HT2c receptor have been described previously (24.Price R.D. Weiner D.M. Chang M.S.S. Sanders-Bush E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44663-44668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged 5-HT2c receptor isoforms were constructed via polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase with the following primers: 5-HT2C-5′, ATATGGTACCACC[ATGGATTATAAGGATGATGATGATGCG]GTGACCCTGAGGAATGCGG; and 5-HT2C-3′, GATCGGGCCCTCACACACTGCTAATCCTTTCGC (brackets surround the epitope sequence, and underlined residues are restriction sites of KpnI or NotI). The PCR products were subcloned into the KpnI-NotI sites of pCDNA3.1+. The primers used for the construction of 5-HT2c-GFP receptor isoforms were: 5-HT2C-5′, ATATAGATCTATGGTGAACCTGAGGAATGCGG; and 5-HT2C-3′, CAGTGAATTCCACACTGCTAATCCTTTCGC (underlined residues are restriction sites of BglII or EcoRI). The PCR products were subcloned into the BglII-EcoRI sites of pEGFP-N2 (Clontech). The sequences were confirmed using an automated ABI DNA sequencer. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium with Earle's salt (MEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and a 1:1000 dilution of gentamicin reagent solution (Invitrogen). Cells were transiently transfected in 100-mm dishes (Falcon) with 5 μg of receptor and 0.8 μg of βarrestin2-GFP or βarrestin1-GFP using a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (32.Barak L.S. Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation—100-mm plates of HEK 293 cells were cotransfected with FLAG 5-HT2cR, βarr2-GFP, or βarr1-GFP and in some experiments with GRK2 or GRK2 dominant negative mutant [K220R]. 18 h after transfection the media was removed and cells were incubated with fresh complemented media. 14 h later, the cells were starved for 5 h before incubation for 30 min at 37 °C with 10 μm serotonin or 1 μm SB206553. The cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by addition of 500 μl of cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, anti-proteases mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl). Cells were scraped on ice and incubated with rotation for 45 min at 4 °C and lysates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 20 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Radioimmune precipitation assay-soluble proteins cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads. After three washes of 10 min in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer for 15 min at 55 °C, resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and detected by Western blotting. Confocal Microscopy in Living Cells—18 h after transfection, cells were split into collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). 14 h later, the medium was replaced with serum-free MEM and cells were starved for 5 h. Then HEK 293 cells were stimulated with 10 μm serotonin or 1 μm SB206553. Confocal microscopy was performed at 37 °C using a heated microscope stage at 100× magnification with a Zeiss laser-scanning microscope (LSM-510). Images were collected sequentially using single line excitation (488 nm) for GFP-labeled βarrestins or GFP-labeled 5-HT2cR. A double line excitation (488 and 568 nm) was used for detection of both GFP-tagged proteins and Texas Red-conjugated transferrin or βarr2-RedFP. For detection of both GFP- and YFP-tagged proteins a broad excitation spectra (488–590 nm) was applied, and a deconvolution process was used to discriminate the respective emission spectra. Sequestration Assays—Measurement of receptor surface expression by ELISA was performed under non-permeabilized conditions as follows. HEK 293 cells plated at a density of 3 × 106 per 100-mm dish were transfected or not with FLAG-5-HT2c receptor cDNA augmented with empty vector cDNA to a total or 7 μg using a calcium phosphate protocol (32.Barak L.S. Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Colapietro A.M. Caron M.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cells were trypsinized 18 h later and plated at a density of 125,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate and incubated in minimal essential media (MEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. After 48 h the cells were serum-starved for 5 h before treatment with 10 μm serotonin or 1 μm SB206553 with or without 5 μm brefeldin A. After 30 or 60 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator the cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and incubated in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min on ice. The cells were incubated on ice for 1 h with 4 μg/ml anti-FLAG M2-HRP antibody and wash three times with ice-cold 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS before being fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The media was removed, and 750 μl of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride was added to each well. The reaction was stopped by 100 μl of HCl (3 n) before measurement of absorbance at 492 nm with a SmartSpec™ 3000 spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Transferrin Uptake—Transferrin uptake was carried out as described previously (33.van Dam E.M. Stoorvogel W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 169-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK 293 transfected cells, grown on collagen-coated 35-mm glass bottom dishes, were staved for 5 h before transferrin treatment. Texas Red-conjugated transferrin was added to the cells at a final concentration of 35 μg/ml and incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. After 30 min the living cells were washed twice with warm MEM containing 10 μm serotonin before microscopy observation at 37 °C. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. from the indicated number of independent experiments performed in triplicate. Statistical comparisons were performed using an unpaired Student's t test. Cellular Localization and Trafficking of 5-HT2cR GFP-tagged Isoforms—First we asked whether the RNA-editing process could affect the subcellular distribution of the three 5-HT2cR isoforms. For that purpose, the 5-HT2cR isoforms were tagged at the C terminus with the enhanced GFP and transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. In the absence of agonist, the 5-HT2cR-VGV-GFP isoform was expressed exclusively at the cell surface (Fig. 1A). After 7 min of serotonin stimulation at a saturating concentration (10 μm), the 5-HT2cR-VGV-GFP isoform underwent internalization and was clearly detected in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the VGV isoform, the 5-HT2cR-INI-GFP chimera was detected mainly in large intracellular vesicles, but a faint signal could also be observed at the plasma membrane in a majority of cells (Fig. 1C, left panel). The agonist-independent internalization observed here most probably reflects the constitutive activity of this isoform. Stimulation of the 5-HT2cR-INI-GFP with serotonin did not induce any noticeable variation of the vesicular distribution of this GFP-tagged isoform, suggesting that the agonist can induce no further internalization of this isoform (Fig. 1C, middle panel). However, after treatment with the 5-HT2cR inverse agonist SB206553 (34.Kennett G.A. Wood M.D. Bright F. Cilia J Piper D.C. Gager T. Thomas D. Baxter G.S. Forbes I.T. Ham P. Blackburn T.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (1 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, the 5-HT2cR-INI-GFP was largely detected at the plasma membrane suggesting recycling of the receptor (Fig. 1C, right panel). With respect to the 5-HT2cR-VSV-GFP isoform, we observed a cellular distribution intermediate between the lowest and the highest constitutively active 5-HT2cR-GFP isoforms. This isoform was detected mainly at the plasma membrane and at a lower degree in intracellular vesicles. Moreover, in response to serotonin stimulation, it was further internalized, whereas treatment with inverse agonist enhanced its plasma membrane localization (Fig. 1B). Quantification of 5-HT2cR Isoform Cell Surface Expression—We next sought to quantify, by ELISA, the respective proportion of each N terminus FLAG-tagged 5-HT2cR isoforms internalized in the presence of agonist or recycled back to the plasma membrane in the presence of inverse agonist. First, we measured the cell surface expression of the FLAG-5-HT2cRVGV isoform transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. After 30 min of 10 μm serotonin stimulation we observed a 38% decrease of FLAG-5-HT2cR-VGV cell surface expression (Fig. 2A). No significant variation of cell surface receptor expression was observed in cells treated with 1 μm SB206553 for 30 min. These findings suggest that the FLAG-5-HT2cR-VGV isoform was expressed at the cell surface and internalized upon agonist stimulation. We observed that the agonist and inverse agonist treatments for 30 min at 37 °C of cells expressing the FLAG-5-HT2cR-VSV resulted in a 29% decrease but a 1.8-fold increase of cell surface expression of this isoform respectively, suggesting that serotonin can induce internalization of cell surface receptors but that not all the receptors are expressed at the plasma membrane in the absence of stimulation (Fig. 2B). Regarding the cellular distribution of the FLAG-5-HT2cR-INI isoform transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells no significant agonist effects were observed (data not shown). Moreover, 30 and 60 min of 1 μm SB206553 exposure, resulted in a 2-fold and a 2.5-fold increase of cell surface receptor expression, respectively (Fig. 2C). These results suggest a dynamic recycling of intracellular receptor pools to the plasma membrane, and small differences of cell surface receptor detected between 30 and 60 min of inverse agonist treatment indicates that most of the internalized receptors were recycled back to the membrane after 30 min. Altogether, these findings confirm our cellular visualization data regarding the intracellular trafficking of the 5-HT2cR-GFP isoforms and indicate that RNA editing induces a progressive loss of constitutive endocytosis of the unedited 5-HT2cR isoform. Investigation of βarrestin Translocation to the 5-HT2cR Isoforms—Next we examined whether the 5-HT2cR could induce a cellular relocalization of βarrestins. To assess this hypothesis, we used HEK 293 cells transiently co-transfected with βarr2-GFP or βarr1-GFP chimeras and each of the three 5-HT2cRs isoforms. In cells expressing the 5-HT2cR-VGV isoform, which best responds to agonist, the βarr2-GFP was found in the cytosol. However, a slight punctated signal could still be detected at the plasma membrane indicating a minor degree of constitutive activity of this isoform and highlighting the sensitivity of the βarrestin translocation assay. After serotonin stimulation, the βarr2-GFP was recruited to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3A, upper panels). By contrast, in cells expressing the constitutively active 5-HT2cR-INI isoform, the βarr2-GFP was localized at the plasma membrane as well as on large vesicles, suggesting a constitutive βarr2 recruitment and receptor internalization (Fig. 3A, lower panels). As expected, stimulation of this isoform with serotonin did not promote any apparent changes in the βarr2-GFP distribution. In cells transiently transfected with the partially responsive 5-HT2cR-VSV isoform, the distribution of the βarr2-GFP was similar to that observed with the 5-HT2cR-INI isoform, but recruitment of the βarr2-GFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane can be further enhanced in the presence of serotonin (Fig. 3A, middle panels). Interestingly, when either the 5-HT2cR-VSV or -INI isoform was expressed, βarr1-GFP was mostly distributed in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, under identical experimental conditions, βarr1-GFP did not appear to redistribute upon serotonin stimulation (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, in some cells a faint punctated βarr1-GFP signal was detected at the plasma membrane, in the absence of agonist, regardless of the 5-HT2cR isoform expressed. Among the tested isoforms, the 5-HT2cR-VGV was the only one capable of inducing a slight βarr1-GFP translocation in response of agonist stimulation (Fig. 3B). Altogether, these results suggest that βarrestin2 is the predominantly interacting βarrestin with the 5-HT2cR isoforms. Characterization of 5-HT2cR-INI-containing Vesicles—To investigate whether the constitutively activated 5-HT2cR-INI isoform traffic with βarrestin, their relative cellular distributions were studied in HEK 293 cells by confocal fluorescence microscopy using a GFP-tagged 5-HT2cR-INI isoform and an Hc-Red-tagged βarr2. We observed that 5-HT2cR-INI-GFP and βarr2-HcRed fully co-localized in large vesicles in absence of agonist (Fig. 4A, upper panels). To ensure that this phenomenon was reflecting a continuous endocytosis-recycling cycle of the constitutively active receptor, we used Texas Red-labeled transferrin, which is well characterized as a marker for recycling compartments (35.Dautry-Varsat A. Biochimie. (Paris). 1986; 68: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 36.Griffiths G. Hoflack B. Simons K. Mellman I. Kornfeld S. Cell. 1988; 52: 329-341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We observed that the βarr2-GFP as well as the 5-HT2cR-INI-GFP co-localized with transferrin-containing vesicles (Fig. 4, B and C). To identify the intracellular compartment containing the 5-HT2cR-INI, we compared the distribution pattern of the 5-HT2cR-INI-GFP and HA-tagged rab11a, a well established marker of the pericentriolar recycling endosome (37.Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbé S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar). We observed that most of the 5-HT2cR-INI-GFP co-localize with rabb11a in absence of stimulation (Fig. 5A). In addition this receptor also co-localized partially with the early endosome marker rab5-YFP (data not shown). Altogether, these data suggest that the 5-HT2cR-INI·βarr2 complexes are present in the same endosomal vesicles and that the 5-HT2cR-INI isoform undergoes constitutive endocytosis.Fig. 5Identification of the intracellular compartment containing the 5-HT2cR-INI isoform in HEK 293 cells. A, Confocal fluorescence micrographs of HEK 293 cells co-transfected with HA-tagged Rab11a (0.7 μg) (red, left panel) and the 5-HT2cR-INI-GFP (5 μg) (green, middle panel) in basal condition."

It has been suggested that bone metastatic prostate cancer cells are osteomimetic and capable of expressing genes and proteins typically expressed by osteoblasts. The ability of preosteoblasts to differentiate and express osteoblastic genes depends on several pathways, including Notch and MAPK. Here we show that notch1 expression is increased 4-5 times in C4-2B and MDA PCa 2b cells (osteoblastic skeletal prostate metastatic cancer cell lines) when compared with nonskeletal metastatic cell lines (LNCaP and DU145). Notch1 ligand, dll1, is expressed only in C4-2B cells. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that Notch1 is present in both human clinical samples from prostate cancer bone metastases and the C4-2B cell line. To determine whether prostate cancer bone metastases respond to osteogenic induction similar to osteoblasts, C4-2B cells were cultured in osteogenic medium that promotes mineralization. C4-2B cells mineralize and express HES-1 (a downstream target of Notch), an effect that is completely inhibited by L-685,458, a Notch activity inhibitor. Furthermore, osteogenic induction increases ERK activation, runx2 expression, and nuclear localization, independent of Notch signaling. Finally, we show that Notch and ERK activation are essential for Runx2 DNA binding activity and osteocalcin gene expression in C4-2B cells in response to osteogenic induction. These studies demonstrate that prostate cancer bone metastatic cell lines acquire osteoblastic properties through independent activation of ERK and Notch signaling; presumably, both pathways are activated in the bone microenvironment.

These studies demonstrate that prostate cancer bone metastatic cell lines acquire osteoblastic properties through independent activation of ERK and Notch signaling; presumably, both pathways are activated in the bone microenvironment. Prostate carcinoma most commonly metastasizes to the lymph nodes and to bone with a 70-80% frequency as determined by autopsy studies. A unique characteristic of skeletal metastases of human prostate cancer is their ability to induce osteoblastic lesions, characterized by new woven bone formation and variable degrees of osteoclastic bone resorption (1Koutsilieris M. Anticancer Res. 1993; 13: 443-449Google Scholar). It has been proposed that factors produced by prostate cells, both normal and neoplastic, have the potential to stimulate new bone formation by effects on both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Included in this group are parathyroid hormone-related peptide (2Iwamura M. di Sant'Agnese P.A. Wu G. Benning C.M. Cockett A.T. Deftos L.J. Abrahamsson P.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1724-1726Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (3Barrack E.R. Prostate. 1997; 31: 61-70Google Scholar), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (4Rabbani S.A. Xing R.H. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 911-920Google Scholar), bone morphogenetic proteins (5Bentley H. Hamdy F.C. Hart K.A. Seid J.M. Williams J.L. Johnstone D. Russell R.G. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 1159-1163Google Scholar, 6Harris S.E. Harris M.A. Mahy P. Wozney J. Feng J.Q. Mundy G.R. Prostate. 1994; 24: 204-211Google Scholar), and endothelin-1 (7Nelson J.B. Carducci M.A. Br. J. Urol. 2000; 85: 45-48Google Scholar). The production of these factors by prostate cancer cells, accompanied by the release of growth factors during osteolysis, is proposed to result in stimulating new woven bone formation by increasing the differentiation of osteoblasts in the bone. Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that prostate cancer bone metastases express genes and proteins typically associated with osteoblasts, including RANK ligand, osteoprotegerin (8Brown J.M. Corey E. Lee Z.D. True L.D. Yun T.J. Tondravi M. Vessella R.L. Urology. 2001; 57: 611-616Google Scholar), sialoproteins, osteopontin (9Jung C. Ou Y.C. Yeung F. Frierson Jr., H.F. Kao C. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 271: 143-150Google Scholar), Runx2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) (10Lin D.L. Tarnowski C.P. Zhang J. Dai J. Rohn E. Patel A.H. Morris M.D. Keller E.T. Prostate. 2001; 47: 212-221Google Scholar), and osteocalcin (11Yeung F. Law W.K. Yeh C.H. Westendorf J.J. Zhang Y. Wang R. Kao C. Chung L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2468-2476Google Scholar). This phenomenon has been attributed to a “unique” ability of prostate cancer cells to acquire “osteoblast-like properties” upon metastasizing to the bone microenvironment, thus enabling them to grow and thrive in this highly restrictive environment (10Lin D.L. Tarnowski C.P. Zhang J. Dai J. Rohn E. Patel A.H. Morris M.D. Keller E.T. Prostate. 2001; 47: 212-221Google Scholar, 11Yeung F. Law W.K. Yeh C.H. Westendorf J.J. Zhang Y. Wang R. Kao C. Chung L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2468-2476Google Scholar). Cell fate determination, mediated by local cell-cell contact, plays a critical role during development of multicellular organisms. The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism utilized by organisms, ranging from worms through humans, involved in fate determination of various cell lineages. Notch belongs to the family of epidermal growth factor-like homeotic genes, which encode transmembrane proteins with variable numbers of epidermal growth factor-like repeats in the extracellular region. In vertebrates, four Notch genes have been described, notch1, -2, -3, and -4; these are highly related to each other and to the Drosophila Notch and C. elegans lin-12 (12Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Google Scholar, 13Lardelli M. Williams R. Lendahl U. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1995; 39: 769-780Google Scholar). There are also multiple Notch ligands in vertebrates that are homologous to the Drosophila ligands, Delta and Serrate (14Weinmaster G. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 9: 91-102Google Scholar). Delta homologs are called “Delta-like” ligands (Dll1 and -4), and the Serrate homologs are called “Jagged” (Jagged-1 and -2). Activation of Notch upon ligand binding is accompanied by proteolytic processing by γ-secretase that releases the intracellular domain of Notch from the membrane. The Notch intracellular domain then translocates into the nucleus and associates with the CSL (CBF-1 (RBP-Jκ)/Su(H)/Lag-1) family of DNA-binding proteins to form a transcriptional activator (15Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Google Scholar). Most of the Notch target genes encode transcription regulators, which, in turn, modulate cell fate by affecting the function of tissue-specific basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors or through other molecular targets, such as activating protein-1 (16Chu J. Jeffries S. Norton J.E. Capobianco A.J. Bresnick E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7587-7597Google Scholar), NF-κB (17Bellavia D. Campese A.F. Alesse E. Vacca A. Felli M.P. Balestri A. Stoppacciaro A. Tiveron C. Tatangelo L. Giovarelli M. Gaetano C. Ruco L. Hoffman E.S. Hayday A.C. Lendahl U. Frati L. Gulino A. Screpanti I. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3337-3348Google Scholar), and most importantly, HES-1 (Hairy and Enhancer-of-split-1) (18McLarren K.W. Lo R. Grbavec D. Thirunavukkarasu K. Karsenty G. Stifani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 530-538Google Scholar). Since Notch ligands are predominantly cell membrane-associated, Notch signaling is thought to mediate interactions between contiguous cells at many sites in the human body, including bone, where it has been shown recently that Notch1 activation by Dll1 stimulates the differentiation of osteoblasts (19Tezuka K. Yasuda M. Watanabe N. Morimura N. Kuroda K. Miyatani S. Hozumi N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 231-239Google Scholar). Osteoblasts, the bone-forming cells, are derived from mesenchymal stem cells after osteogenic differentiation. Under in vitro osteogenic conditions, isolated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) 1The abbreviations used are: hMSChuman mesenchymal stem cellsERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseOSE-2osteoblast-specific element 2MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinase. form mineralized aggregates or nodules and increase their expression of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, which are important markers of osteoblast differentiation (20Bruder S.P. Jaiswal N. Ricalton N.S. Mosca J.D. Kraus K.H. Kadiyala S. Clin. Orthop. 1998; : 247-256Google Scholar). Many of the osteoblast-related genes are modulated by Runx2 binding to a specific DNA element in the regulatory region of these target genes. Runx2 is an essential transcription factor for the differentiation of osteoblasts from mesenchymal precursors and the regulation of bone matrix deposition by differentiated osteoblasts (21Ducy P. Dev. Dyn. 2000; : 247-256Google Scholar). This suggests that Runx2 regulates osteoblast gene expression and function at multiple levels. Recent studies have demonstrated that prostate cancer cells, similar to mature osteoblasts, are capable of expressing and secreting osteocalcin upon metastasizing to bone (11Yeung F. Law W.K. Yeh C.H. Westendorf J.J. Zhang Y. Wang R. Kao C. Chung L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2468-2476Google Scholar). In addition, it has been shown that the osteoblastic C4-2B prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP derivative cell line) (22Wu H.C. Hsieh J.T. Gleave M.E. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Google Scholar) has an increased expression of Runx2 (10Lin D.L. Tarnowski C.P. Zhang J. Dai J. Rohn E. Patel A.H. Morris M.D. Keller E.T. Prostate. 2001; 47: 212-221Google Scholar), whereas the osteolytic PC3 cell line expresses transcriptionally active Cbaf1 as shown by its ability to bind to OSE2 on the osteocalcin promoter (11Yeung F.

This suggests that Runx2 expression/activity could play a role in the modulation of gene expression in prostate cancer metastases. Interestingly, HES-1 (a downstream target of Notch signaling) can physically interact with Runx2 and potentiate its mediated transactivation in transfected cells (18McLarren K.W. Lo R. Grbavec D. Thirunavukkarasu K. Karsenty G. Stifani S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 530-538Google Scholar). Based on this, we hypothesize that the activation of Notch in prostate cancer metastases in the bone microenvironment leads to a cascade of signaling events, which ultimately results in a unique pattern of gene expression similar to that seen in mature osteoblasts. human mesenchymal stem cells extracellular signal-regulated kinase osteoblast-specific element 2 mitogen-activated protein kinase. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of the Notch signaling pathway in the unique osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer bone metastases. We report that osteoblastic prostate cancer cell lines (C4-2B and MDA PCa 2b) specifically express notch1, and the Notch ligand, dll1, is expressed only in the C4-2B cell line. This expression pattern of Notch receptor and ligand leads to the expression of HES-1 transcription factor independent of ERK activation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in vitro osteogenic induction of prostate cancer cells increases ERK phosphorylation and Runx2 expression and activation, independent of Notch activation. Finally, we demonstrate that Notch signaling and ERK activation in skeletal prostate cancer metastases is critical for Runx2 DNA binding and osteocalcin expression. Taken together, our results suggest that Notch activation plays a critical role in the ability of prostate cancer metastases to acquire “osteoblast-like” properties. Cell Culture and Osteoblastic Differentiation—The human prostatic cell lines (Table I) DU145, LNCaP, and MDA PCa 2b were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The C4-2B cell line was purchased from UroCor, Inc. (Oklahoma City, OK). In addition, we used hMSC provided by the University of Alabama National Institutes of Health-funded Research Core Center for Musculoskeletal Disease. DU145 and LNCaP were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. MDA PCa 2b was maintained in Kaighn's modification of Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 25 ng/ml Cholera toxin, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 0.005 mm phosphoethanolamine, 100 pg/ml hydrocortisone, 45 nm selenious acid, 0.005 mg/ml insulin, and 20% fetal bovine serum. The C4-2B cell line was maintained in T medium (80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 20% F-12 medium, 3 g/liter NaCO3, 5 μg/ml insulin, 13.6 pg/ml triiodothyronine, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.25 μg/ml biotin, 25 μg/ml adenine) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. The hMSC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. All cultures were supplemented with 100 units/liter penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For osteogenic induction, regular medium was supplemented with 10 mm β-glycerophosphate and 50 μm ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (23Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D.

The yield and purity of RNA was estimated spectrophotometrically using the A260/A280 ratio. The quality of RNA was examined by gel electrophoresis. One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase, and the equivalent of 10 ng was used for the PCRs. These were carried out in a final volume of 25 μl containing 0.2 mm dNTPs, 120 nm each primer, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase. TaqMan real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using the relative standard curve method with SYBRGreen (TaqMan PCR detector 5700; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The expression of 18 S rRNA was used as control. The sequences for the specific primers used in this study were as follows: notch1, forward primer (5′-CACTGTGGGCGGGTCC-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTTGTATTGGTTCGGCACCAT-3′) (24Shou J. Ross S. Koeppen H. de Sauvage F.J. Gao W.Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7291-7297Google Scholar); dll1, forward primer (5′-TGTGTGACGAACACTACTACGGAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-GTGAAGTGGCCGAAGGCA-3′) (24Shou J.

Whole Cell Protein Extraction—At the end of the study, cells were washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and then resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). A mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors consisting of 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.1 mm β-glycerophosphate was added to the lysis buffer. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant protein concentration was measured using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay (25Zayzafoon M. Botolin S. McCabe L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37212-37218Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell or nuclear extracts were loaded (30 μg/lane) onto an SDS mini-PAGE system. Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Immobilon-P (Millipore Corp.), using a Bio-Rad wet transfer system. Protein transfer efficiency and size determination were verified using prestained protein markers. Membranes were then blocked with Blotto B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently incubated overnight with antibodies directed against Notch1, ERK, phosphorylated ERK, Runx2, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Signals were detected using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Calcium Measurement—Cells were lysed with double distilled H2O, accompanied by three freeze/thaw cycles. Calcium content was measured using a calcium detection kit (Arsenazo III; Sigma). Nuclear Protein Extraction—C4-2B cells were washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were then isolated by detergent lysis of the cells using an Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.56 m sucrose. Nuclei were then treated with a hypotonic solution containing 10 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm KCl followed by a 30-min incubation at 4 °C in an extraction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 600 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA. Nuclei were finally centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant protein concentration was measured by the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay. All solutions in this procedure contained a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors similar to that used in the whole cell protein extraction. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Four micrograms of nuclear extracts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the human Runx2 consensus sequence. The oligonucleotide sequence used as a probe was 5′-CGCAGCTCCCAACCACATATCCTCT-3′ (26Ziros P.G. Gil A.P. Georgakopoulos T. Habeos I. Kletsas D. Basdra E.K. Papavassiliou A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23934-23941Google Scholar) (top strand), derived from the human osteocalcin promoter (-141 to -165), and contained an OSE2 motif (AACCACA) (27Ducy P. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1858-1869Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide with mutation in the Runx2 binding site was also used to confirm binding specificity. The mutant Runx2 sequence is 5′-CGCAGCTCCCAgaCACATATCCTCT-3′ (top strand). The double-stranded Runx2 probe was end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to standard protocols. DNA-protein complexes were then resolved by 5% native polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C with an intensifying screen. For the supershift experiment, nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with HES-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in binding buffer for 45 min at room temperature. 32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the human Runx2 consensus sequence was then added, and the mixture was further incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Immunohistochemistry and Human Tissue Samples—Human bone samples from four patients were obtained from the Surgical Pathology Department of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospitals and Clinics with the approval of the Institutional Review Board. Tissues were formalin-fixed and decalcified in EDTA before processing on a VIP tissue processor followed by paraffin embedding. Sections were cut at 5 μm for immunostaining. C4-2B cells were cultured on glass coverslips for 4 days and then formalin-fixed. Tissues were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by antigen retrieval using 10 mm citrate buffer, pH 6. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 1% hydrogen peroxide. Samples were then blocked for 1 h in Fc receptor blocker (Innovex Biosciences, Richmond, CA). Anti-Notch1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or pancytokeratin (Bio-genex) was diluted in Fc Blocker solution and applied to the sections for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Biotin-conjugated secondary antibodies were then used, followed by incubation with avidin-biotin enzyme reagents. Finally, specimens were incubated in peroxidase substrate for 30 s. Tissues were counterstained in Gill's heamatoxylin for 10 s, dehydrated, mounted, and coversliped. Negative controls were processed alongside the examined tissue, but rabbit IgG was used instead of the primary antibody. At least 10 randomly selected microscopic fields were examined using a ×10 and ×40 objective. Photos were taken using a SPOT digital camera. Statistical Analysis—All statistical analyses were performed using the Microsoft Excel data analysis program for t test analysis or using SPSS statistical analysis program for analysis of variance with the Bonferroni test. Experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise stated. Values were expressed as a mean ± S.E. Given the importance of Notch activation in determining cell fate, we examined notch1 gene expressions in two human osteoblastic prostate cancer cell lines (C4-2B and MDA PCa 2b) and compared them with brain (DU145) and lymph node (LNCaP) metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (Table I). Fig. 1A demonstrates that notch1 gene expression is increased 5-fold in osteoblastic (C4-2B and PCa 2b) versus nonosteoblastic (LNCaP and DU145) prostate cancer metastatic cell lines. This increase in gene expression is accompanied by an increase in the amount of Notch1 protein (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Notch1 is specifically expressed in osteoblastic prostate metastases. Immunohistochemical studies further demonstrate the expression and distribution of Notch1 in C4-2B cells (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, Dll1 Notch ligand is only detected in the C4-2B cell line (Fig. 1D). The presence of both Notch1 and Dll1 in the same cell suggests that Notch signaling can be successfully activated in C4-2B cells without the need to co-culture them with Notch ligand-expressing cells. The expression of other Notch receptors (Notch2, -3, and -4) and ligands (Dll4 and Jagged-1 and -2) were also examined but showed no significant correlation between skeletal and nonskeletal metastatic cell lines (data not shown). In order to examine the expression of Notch1 in prostate cancer bone metastases in vivo, human clinical samples from patients who developed bone metastases from a primary prostate tumor were obtained from the Surgical Pathology Department of the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospitals and Clinics. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 2A) confirms the osteoblastic nature of the prostate cancer metastases, which is demonstrated by the degree of trabacular bone present in the tissue. Immunohistochemical staining for pancytokeratin confirms the epithelial origin of the metastatic cancer cells and clearly distinguished them from the bone mesenchymal cells (Fig. 2B). Similar to C4-2B cells, human osteoblastic prostate cancer metastatic cells express Notch1 (Fig. 2C). Although most of the positively stained cells show an extranuclear distribution, Notch1 is also detected intranuclearly. To examine the ability of prostate cancer metastases to function similar to osteoblasts and to form mineralized bone, we cultured LNCaP, MDA PCa 2b, and C4-2B cells with and without osteogenic medium, consisting of normal culture medium, supplemented with ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate. This method of osteogenic induction has been previously characterized and is widely used for inducing osteoblast differentiation in vitro (23Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Google Scholar). Cells were also treated with 100 nm Notch inhibitor (L-685,458), known to be a potent γ-secretase inhibitor (28Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C.D. Zysk J. Liu X. Birr C. Sylvester M.A. Edwards P.D. Scott C.D. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31499-31505Google Scholar), to determine the role of Notch signaling in bone formation by metastatic prostate cancer cells. After 10 days of osteogenic induction, the calcium content in cultures was measured. Fig. 3 demonstrates that both LNCaP cells (which do not express Notch1) and MDA PCa 2b cells (which do not express Dll1) fail to increase calcium deposition in culture. On the other hand, C4-2B cells, which form osteoblastic bone metastases in vivo (22Wu H.C. Hsieh J.T. Gleave M.E. Brown N.M. Pathak S. Chung L.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 406-412Google Scholar) and express both Notch1 and Dll1, increase calcium deposition 5-fold when cultured in osteogenic medium. This increase is completely abolished when Notch inhibitor (L-685,458) is added. We also used hMSC as a positive control, since these cells develop into osteoblasts when cultured in osteogenic medium (23Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R. Science. 1999; 284: 143-147Google Scholar). We demonstrate a 7-fold increase in calcium content when hMSC are induced to develop into osteoblasts, by the presence of osteogenic medium. Interestingly, Notch inhibitor is also effective in blocking this mineralization. Osteogenic induction induces the osteoblastic differentiation of preosteoblasts by increasing the activity of MAPK, which ultimately leads to an increase in Runx2 activation and DNA binding (28Tian G. Sobotka-Briner C.D. Zysk J. Liu X. Birr C. Sylvester M.A. Edwards P.D. Scott C.D. Greenberg B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31499-31505Google Scholar). In addition, osteoblastic cell differentiation is also positively regulated by Notch1 (19Tezuka K. Yasuda M. Watanabe N. Morimura N. Kuroda K. Miyatani S. Hozumi N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 231-239Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the effect of osteogenic induction on Notch signaling by examining the expression of HES-1, a known downstream target of Notch signaling, in C4-2B cells. Furthermore, to determine the specific role of both Notch and ERK signaling in HES-1 expression, we pharmacologically inhibited Notch signaling with L-685-458 or ERK signaling with U0126 (29Xiao G. Jiang D. Gopalakrishnan R. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36181-36187Google Scholar). As expected, LNCaP cells, which lack Notch1 receptor, did not express HES-1 (Fig. 4). In contrast, C4-2B cells, which express both Notch1 and its ligand, expressed HES-1, regardless of osteogenic induction. The inhibition of Notch signaling by γ-secretase inhibitor successfully inhibited HES-1 expression, whereas the ERK inhibitor, U0126, had no effect. To examine whether C4-2B cells would respond similarly to osteoblasts when cultured in osteogenic medium, we tested the activation of ERK in response to osteogenic induction while inhibiting the activation of either Notch or ERK signaling. Fig. 5, A and B, demonstrate that osteogenic induction increases ERK phosphorylation in C4-2B cells, as in osteoblasts, without any change in the total ERK levels. Notch signaling does not seem to play a role in this activation, since we show no significant difference in ERK activity when Notch signaling was inhibited for 24 h by 1000 nm L-685,458 (Fig. 5A). As expected, U0126 inhibited the activation of ERK in response to osteogenic induction (Fig. 5B). The activity of MAPK in osteoblasts ultimately leads to an increase in Runx2 expression and its activation/nuclear localization (30Xiao G. Jiang D. Thomas P. Benson M.D. Guan K. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4453-4459Google Scholar). Fig. 6 demonstrates that LNCaP cells do not express Runx2, even under conditions of osteogenic induction. In contrast, C4-2B cells express basal levels of Runx2 mRNA and nuclear protein. Upon osteogenic induction, both mRNA and nuclear localization of Runx2 are incre"

https://openalex.org/W2024345327,"Constitutive activation of Akt has been found in many types of human cancer, and is believed to promote proliferation and increased cell survival thereby contributing to cancer progression. In this study, we examined Akt phosphorylation on Ser473 and Thr308 in seven IGF-II-overexpressing rhabdomyosarcomas (RMS) cells. All the RMS cell lines tested had high levels of Akt phosphorylation on Thr308, whereas three cell lines (Rh5, Rh18, and CTR) had a much lower level of Akt phosphorylation on Ser473. To determine whether the difference in Akt phosphorylation on Ser473, but not on Thr308, observed among cell lines is a cell-specific phenomenon or due to other factors, which possibly downregulate Akt phosphorylation, we examined expression of PTEN protein, which acts as a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway through its ability to dephosphorylate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3). The levels of PTEN expression inversely correlate with Akt phosphorylation on Ser473, but not on Thr308. Consistent with this finding, transfection of wild-type PTEN into RMS and mouse myoblast C2C12 cells resulted in reduced Akt phosphorylation on Ser473, but not on Thr308. Our data suggest that Ser473 may be a key target residue for PTEN to modulate the effects of IGF-II on activating the PI3K/Akt pathway in RMS cells. A better understanding of the pathway in RMS will likely contribute to insights into the biology of the RMS tumorigenesis and hopefully lead to novel therapeutic options."
https://openalex.org/W1971041164,"Platelet agonists initiate aggregation and secretion by activating receptors coupled to the G-protein Gq, thereby raising cytosolic Ca2+, [Ca2+]i. The rise in [Ca2+]i is facilitated via inhibition of cAMP formation by the inhibitory G-protein of adenylyl cyclase, Gi. Since insulin attenuates platelet activation, we investigated whether insulin interferes with cAMP regulation. Here we report that insulin (0.5–200 nmol/liter) interferes with agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i (ADP, thrombin), cAMP suppression (thrombin), and aggregation (ADP). The effects of insulin are as follows: (i) independent of the P2Y12 receptor, which mediates ADP-induced cAMP lowering; (ii) not observed during Gs-mediated cAMP formation; (iii) unaffected by treatments that affect phosphodiesterases (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine); and (iv) not changed by interfering with NO-mediated regulation of cAMP degradation (NG-monomethyl-l-arginine). Hence, insulin might interfere with Gi. Indeed, insulin induces the following: (i) tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor, the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and Giα2; (ii) co-precipitation of IRS-1 with Giα2 but not with other Gα subunits. Despite persistent receptor activation, the association of IRS-1 with Giα2 is transient, being optimal at 5 min and 1 nmol/liter insulin, which is sufficient to suppress Ca2+ signaling by ADP, and at 10 min and 100 nmol/liter insulin, which is required to suppress Ca2+ signaling by thrombin. Epinephrine, a known platelet sensitizer and antagonist of insulin, abolishes the effect of insulin on [Ca2+]i, tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2, and aggregation by interfering with the phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunit. We conclude that insulin attenuates platelet functions by interfering with cAMP suppression through IRS-1 and Gi.

Patients with diabetes mellitus have a 2–4-fold increased risk for coronary artery disease. They suffer from both microvascular (nephropathy and retinopathy) and macrovascular (peripheral artery disease) complications (1Beckman J.A. Creager M.A. Libby P. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2002; 287: 2570-2581Google Scholar). Apart from increased concentrations of certain coagulation factors (2Carr M.E. J. Diabet. Complicat. 2001; 15: 44-54Google Scholar), patients with diabetes mellitus type I and II have platelets that show increased adhesion, aggregation, thromboxane production, and P-selectin expression (3Winocour P.D. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 26-31Google Scholar). The hyperactivity might be caused by the absence of insulin inhibition, since intensive insulin treatment in diabetic patients reduced platelet aggregation (4Turk Z. Flego I. Kerum G. Horm. Metab. Res. 1996; 28: 95-100Google Scholar). The insulin receptor is a heterotetrameric transmembrane glycoprotein composed of two extracellular α subunits (135 kDa each) and two transmembrane β subunits (95 kDa each) that function as allosteric enzymes in which the α subunit inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the β subunit. Insulin binding to the α subunit relieves the inhibition of the kinase activity in the β subunit leading to autophosphorylation of the β subunits and a conformational change that further increases the kinase activity. The insulin receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylates proteins such as Shc and the insulin receptor substrates IRS-1 (165–185 kDa) and IRS-2 (180–190 kDa). IRS-1 and IRS-2 have a highly conserved amino terminus, which contains a pleckstrin homology domain, a phosphotyrosine binding domain, and a carboxyl terminus with several tyrosine phosphorylation sites. IRS-1 and IRS-2 are complementary and act as “docking sites” to several Src homology 2 domains containing proteins, such as the regulatory subunits of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 1The abbreviations used are: PI3Kphosphatidylinositol 3-kinasePDEsphosphodiesterasesIBMX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthinePRPplatelet-rich plasmaPGprostaglandinNOnitric oxide.

GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) can also act as signal transducers for the insulin receptor. G-proteins are guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins that function as molecular switches between a GTP-bound “on state” and a GDP-bound “off state.” These proteins amplify, transmit, and integrate signals. The major G-proteins involved in platelet aggregation and secretion are Gqα, which mediates increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, and Giα, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase thereby suppressing cAMP that is an inhibitor of platelets (6Akkerman J.W.N. Gresele P. Page C.P. Fuster V. Vermylen J. Platelets in Thrombotic and Non-thrombotic Disorders: Pathophysiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics. 1st Ed. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002: 204-220Google Scholar). Receptors that couple to G-proteins are generally seven-transmembrane proteins, but there are important exceptions. The insulin-like growth factor II receptor has a single transmembrane domain and couples directly to Gi2 in a manner similar to that of conventional G-protein-coupled receptors (7Kuemmerle J.F. Murthy K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7187-7194Google Scholar). Studies have been reported suggesting that the insulin receptor binds Giα2 (8Okamoto T. Okamoto T. Murayama Y. Hayashi Y. Ogata E.

The insulin receptor is present on muscle, liver, and adipose tissue but also on endothelial cells, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. A human platelet contains ∼570 insulin receptors (10Hajek A.S. Joist J.H. Baker R.K. Jarett L. Daughaday W.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1979; 63: 1060-1065Google Scholar).

In insulin-resistant patients, platelet inhibition by insulin is attenuated or absent (13Trovati M. Anfossi G. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 609-622Google Scholar, 14Westerbacka J. Yki-Järvinen H.

Many platelet agonists initiate aggregation and secretion of granule contents via Gq which induces Ca2+ release from intracellular storage sites and an increase in [Ca2+]i. A rise in [Ca2+]i is a key step in platelet activation. It triggers granule secretion thereby releasing ADP, activates the fibrinogen receptor (integrin αIIbβ3) forming aggregates, and induces a procoagulant surface that facilitates the formation of thrombin. One of the mechanisms that suppress platelet activation is an increase in cAMP. The inhibition is mediated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A. This kinase interferes with multiple steps in platelet activation cascades, such as receptor-ligand interaction, the activity of G-proteins, and the activation of phospholipase Cβ, protein kinase C, and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Protein kinase A also interferes with the elevation of [Ca2+]i and inhibits actin-binding protein and caldesmon that are involved in cytoskeletal reorganization (15Schwarz U.R. Walter U. Eigenthaler M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 62: 1153-1161Google Scholar). Because a small rise in cAMP already leads to a strong activation of protein kinase A, platelet-activating sequences are extremely sensitive to increases in cAMP (16Eigenthaler M. Nolte C. Halbrugge M. Walter U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 471-481Google Scholar, 17van Gorp R.M.A. Feijge M.A.H. Vuist W.M.J. Rook M.B. Heemskerk J.W.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1543-1552Google Scholar). Optimal platelet functions require maximal stimulation of the Gq pathway and the concomitant inhibition of cAMP production. cAMP is formed from ATP through the action of adenylyl cyclase and is subsequently metabolized by phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Adenylyl cyclase is inhibited by Gi, which makes this G-protein a key factor in the control of cAMP formation. Gi is activated either by direct interaction with the agonist receptor or via secreted granule ADP, which activates the P2Y12 receptor via an extracellular feedback loop (18Gachet C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 222-232Google Scholar, 19Remijn J.A. Wu Y.P. Jeninga E.H. IJsseldijk M.J.W. van Willigen G. de Groot P.G. Sixma J.J. Nurden A.T. Nurden P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Gousset L. Conley P.B. Mortensen R.M. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 477-483Google Scholar). Since Gi is involved in insulin signaling, we addressed the question whether insulin inhibits platelet functions by interfering with the activity of Gi. Materials—Prosta-5,13-dien-1-oic acid, 6,9-epoxy-11,15-dihydroxy-, monosodium salt, [5Z,9α,11α,13E,15S] COOH (prostacyclin, PGI2 sodium salt) was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI).

ADP was purchased from Roche Applied Science. NG-Monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) was supplied by Calbiochem. The ADP receptor P2Y12 antagonist, the ATP analogue N6-(2-methylthioethyl)-2-(3,3,3-trifluoropropylthio)-β,γ-dichloromethylene ATP (AR-C69931MX), was a kind gift from Astra Zeneca (Loughborough, UK). All other chemical reagents were of analytical grade. Antibodies—4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). IRS-1 (C-20), Gzα (I-20), and Giα2 (T-19) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (GAMPO) were obtained from Dako A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). Anti-α-rabbit horseradish peroxidase was supplied by Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Insulin receptor phospho-Tyr1158 antibodies were delivered by BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Gsα and Gqα antibodies were obtained from Calbiochem. Platelet Isolation—All healthy, non-diabetic volunteers claimed not to have taken any medication 10 days prior to blood collection. After obtaining informed consent, freshly drawn venous blood was collected into 0.1 volume of 130 mmol/liter trisodium citrate. Citrated blood was centrifuged (150 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was collected and used for Ca2+ measurements in intact platelets with Fura 2-AM. For the preparation of washed platelets, PRP was supplemented with 0.1 volume of ACD (2.5% trisodium citrate, 1.5% citric acid, 2% d-glucose) for acidification to pH 6.5 and 0.001 volume of PGI2 (10 ng/ml final concentration), centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer (145 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.25) containing 5 mmol/liter d-glucose. The final platelet concentration was adjusted to 2.0 × 1011 cells/liter. Prior to the experiments, platelets were kept at 20 °C for 45 min to ensure a resting state. In some experiments platelets were incubated with AR-C69931MX (50 nmol/liter, 30 s), IBMX (1 mmol/liter, 5 min), and l-NMMA (100 μmol/liter, 20 min) at 20 °C. Measurement of Ca2+Mobilization—PRP was incubated with 3 μm Fura 2-AM (45 min, 37 °C, light-protected). After incubation, PRP was acidified with ACD to pH 6.5, centrifuged again (330 × g, 15 min, 20 °C), and resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode buffer (145 mmol/liter NaCl, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 0.5 mmol/liter Na2HPO4, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 10 mmol/liter HEPES, pH 7.25) containing 5 mmol/liter d-glucose. The final platelet concentration was adjusted to 2.0 × 1011 cells/liter. Fura-2 fluorescence was recorded in 1.0-ml aliquots of platelet suspension without additional Ca2+ at 20 °C in a F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and emission at 510 nm. Changes in [Ca2+]i were monitored using the Fura-2 fluorescence ratio and calibrated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (22Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). Measurement of cAMP—Washed platelets were incubated at 20 °C. Samples were lysed in 0.33 volumes of 7% perchloric acid followed by centrifugation (11,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). cAMP levels, [cAMP], were determined in a cAMP 3H assay system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Washed platelets were incubated at 20 °C, and samples were collected in 10× lysis buffer containing 1% w/v SDS, 5% w/v n-octyl glucoside, 0.5 m EDTA, and 10% v/v Nonidet P-40, with 10% v/v protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mmol/liter Na3VO4. Detergent-insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation for 1 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine, Giα2 (T-19) or IRS-1 (C-20) antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, washed, solubilized in 3× sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels. Immunoblotting—Washed platelets were incubated at 20 °C, and samples were collected in 3× sample buffer. Aliquots were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5% gels. Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose sheets and blocked in either 5% Protifar, 0.1% TBST or 4% PY-BSA, 0.1% TBST. Blots were probed separately with a primary antibody (4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine, IRS-1 (C-20), Giα2 (T-19), Gzα (I-20), Gsα or Gqα antibodies for immunoprecipitations and anti-insulin receptor phospho-Tyr1158 for whole cell lysates) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. The proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (GAMPO for 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine and anti-α-rabbit horseradish peroxidase for all other antibodies, respectively). As control for lane loading, the blots were stripped by a 30-min incubation in 0.1% TBST with 2% SDS at 80 °C. After extensive washing, the blots were subjected to the same procedure as described above. Since the anti-insulin receptor phospho-Tyr1158 antibodies recognize an aspecific band at 250 kDa, this band was taken as a control for lane loading. The intensity of the bands was quantitated with ImageQuant software. Measurement of Platelet Aggregation—PRP was prepared as described above, and the platelet concentration was adjusted to 2.0 × 1011 cells/liter with platelet-poor plasma. Aliquots of 0.5 ml were warmed to 37 °C for 5 min, followed by stimulation. Platelet aggregation was monitored continuously for 7 min under 900 rpm in an aggregometer (model 570 VS, Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA). Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's multiple comparisons test as post-test for repeated measurements unless mentioned otherwise. Results are expressed as means ± S.D. of n observations. Differences were considered to be significant at p < 0.05. Insulin Inhibits Agonist-induced Ca2+Mobilization—Fura 2-AM-loaded platelets were incubated at 20 °C with 1 nmol/liter insulin and stimulated with 10 μmol/liter ADP. Insulin alone did not change the basal [Ca2+]i (19.4 ± 2.7 nmol/liter), but a preincubation with insulin led to a 25 ± 6% reduction of the ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 1A). Studies with different incubation times showed that optimal inhibition was observed after 5 min of preincubation. Simultaneous addition of insulin and ADP or incubation times of 15 min or longer failed to reveal the inhibition by insulin (Fig. 1B). To investigate the threshold above which insulin inhibited Ca2+ mobilization, platelets were incubated for 5 min with different concentrations of insulin followed by stimulation with ADP. There was a dose-dependent increase in the inhibition by insulin, which became significant at 0.5 nmol/liter insulin and more (Fig. 1C). ADP activates platelets via the P2Y1 receptor, which is coupled to Gq and signals to [Ca2+]i, while concurrently suppressing cAMP formation via the P2Y12 receptor and Gi (18Gachet C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 222-232Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the P2Y12 antagonist AR-C69931MX induced the same degree of inhibition of ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization as insulin (100 nmol/liter). A combination of AR-C69931MX and insulin did not inhibit Ca2+ signaling stronger than each of these factors alone. Thus, insulin appears to inhibit ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization by interfering with the regulation of Gi. Insulin also inhibited Ca2+ mobilization induced by thrombin. Stimulation with 0.25 units/ml thrombin induced a larger increase in [Ca2+]i than 10 μmol/liter ADP, and more insulin was required to inhibit this response. When platelets were incubated with 100 nmol/liter insulin prior to stimulation with 0.25 units/ml thrombin, a 25 ± 8% fall in the Ca2+ response was observed (Fig. 3A). Optimal inhibition required a preincubation of 10–15 min, and again there was a tendency to normalize after longer incubation (Fig. 3B). Insulin attenuated the thrombin-induced Ca2+ response dose-dependently leading to optimal inhibition at 100 nmol/liter or more after 10 min of preincubation (Fig. 3C). Effect of Insulin on the Thrombin-induced Decrease of cAMP—To investigate whether insulin interfered with the regulation of adenylyl cyclase, platelets were incubated with insulin, and [cAMP] was determined. Insulin alone (1, 10, and 100 nmol/liter) did not change the basal [cAMP] (6.7 ± 1.3 nmol/1011 platelets) during 10 min of incubation. Stimulation with thrombin (0.25 units/ml) induced a 60% decrease of basal cAMP, as in agreement with a previous publication (23Juska A. Farndale R.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 245-253Google Scholar). This reduction was smaller when insulin (100 nmol/liter) and thrombin were added simultaneously and completely disappeared after 10 min of preincubation with insulin (Fig. 4A). Addition of PGI2 (10 ng/ml) raised [cAMP] to 27.3 ± 2.0 nmol/1011 platelets in 10 min. A similar rise was found when platelets were preincubated for 10 min with insulin (1, 10, and 100 nmol/liter). Thus, insulin failed to interfere with the activation of adenylyl cyclase by PGI2 (Fig. 4B). To assess whether insulin interfered with cAMP degradation, platelets were treated with IBMX, an inhibitor of PDEs. IBMX raised the basal [cAMP] to 12.5 ± 2.9 nmol/1011 platelets in 5 min, and this effect was not disturbed by insulin. Again, thrombin interfered with the rise in cAMP, and insulin abolished the effect of thrombin. Thus, insulin only interfered with cAMP regulation in the presence of an agonist that activates Gi (Fig. 4C). Earlier studies with platelets suspended in plasma suggested that insulin inhibited platelets by raising [cAMP] (24Trovati M. Anfossi G. Massucco P. Mattiello L. Costamagna C. Piretto V. Mularoni E. Cavalot F. Bosia F. Bosia A. Ghigo D. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 742-749Google Scholar). This effect was attributed to insulin-induced formation of nitric oxide (NO) via NO synthase and subsequent inhibition of PDE3b. To investigate whether a similar mechanism was present in isolated platelet suspensions, platelets were treated with l-NMMA, an inhibitor of NO synthase. l-NMMA did not change the basal [cAMP] or the rise induced by PGI2. Also the suppression of the [cAMP] increase by thrombin was left undisturbed. Again, insulin interfered with the fall in cAMP induced by thrombin, and this effect was the same in the absence and presence of l-NMMA (Fig. 4D). These data argue against a role for NO-mediated cAMP control in the present studies. Insulin Increases the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Giα2—To address the question whether insulin interfered with the regulation of cAMP formation via Gi, immunoprecipitation studies were performed using an anti-Giα2 antibody, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2 on Western blot was measured using a 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Treatment of platelets with 1 nmol/liter insulin induced a transient increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2, with an optimal effect between 2 and 5 min (Fig. 5, A and C). Similar results were obtained in immunoprecipitates with 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody on blots with a Giα2 antibody (Fig. 5B). A 5-min incubation period with increasing concentrations of insulin (0.5, 1, and 10 nmol/liter) showed a dose-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2 (see below). These results suggest that insulin interfered with the fall in cAMP via tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2. IRS-1 Co-precipitates with Giα2—To investigate whether IRS-1 played a role in insulin signaling to Giα2, platelets were treated with insulin, and immunoprecipitates of Giα2 were analyzed for IRS-1. As shown in Fig. 6A, preincubation with 1 nmol/liter insulin induced association of Giα2 with IRS-1 reaching a maximum after 5 min. Thereafter was a rapid decline in the appearance of the IRS-1 band, and after 10 min it had disappeared. Increasing the insulin concentration to 100 nmol/liter led to a stronger co-association between Giα2 and IRS-1 and a slower dissociation of the two components. Here, complex formation was apparent between 5 and 10 min. These findings suggest that IRS-1 takes part in insulin signaling to Giα2 by direct binding to the G-protein subunit and demonstrate that the association depends on the insulin concentration showing a weak and short interaction at 1 nmol/liter insulin and a stronger and more persistent interaction at 100 nmol/liter insulin. The co-association between IRS-1 and Giα2 found in Giα2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6A) was also present in immunoprecipitates of IRS-1 analyzed with a Giα2 antibody (Fig. 6B). A survey for the presence of Gqα, Gsα, and Gzα was negative, indicating that the interaction between IRS-1 and a Gα subunit was specific for Giα2. Phosphorylation of the Insulin Receptor and IRS-1—The transient nature of the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2 (Fig. 5) and the co-association of IRS-1 with Giα2 (Fig. 6) suggested that signal generation by the insulin receptor was equally transient. To clarify how the insulin receptor was activated, the phosphorylation of the receptor β subunit was measured with an antibody against phospho-Tyr1158 of the insulin receptor. Treatment of platelets with increasing concentrations of insulin for 15 min induced a dose-dependent phosphorylation of the β subunit (Fig. 7A). Time courses over a 15-min incubation period showed that 1 nmol/liter insulin induced an increase in β subunit phosphorylation that reached a plateau after 5 min and that 100 nmol/liter insulin induced a 5-fold stronger phosphorylation that reached a plateau after 25 min (Fig. 7, B and C and not shown). Importantly, there was no indication of receptor dephosphorylation during this period at either insulin concentration. Concurrent analysis of IRS-1 showed a dose-dependent phosphorylation induced by insulin. Both at 1 and 100 nmol/liter insulin, this phosphorylation was transient showing an optimum between 5 and 10 min and decreasing to prestimulating values after 15 min. Thus, the transient phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Giα2 was not caused by receptor inactivation but was the result of interference with insulin signaling at a step downstream of receptor activation and upstream of the formation of an IRS-1-Giα2 complex. Effect of Epinephrine on Insulin-induced Platelet Inhibition—Epinephrine is known to enhance the sensitivity of platelets to activating agents by reducing the level of cAMP (23Juska A. Farndale R.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 245-253Google Scholar, 25Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 320-325Google Scholar) and to antagonize the effect of insulin in rat skeletal muscle by decreasing the IRS-1-associated activity of PI3K (27Hunt D.G. Ding Z. Ivy J.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 92: 1285-1292Google Scholar). To investigate whether epinephrine interfered with the effects of insulin on [Ca2+]i, platelets were incubated for 5 min with insulin (1 and 10 nmol/liter), and epinephrine (10 μmol/liter) was added 1 min prior to stimulation with ADP. Epinephrine increased ADP-induced Ca2+ mobilization by about 20% (Fig. 8A). The lower Ca2+ increase in the presence of insulin (1 and 10 nmol/liter) completely normalized in the presence of epinephrine. Thus, epinephrine abolished the inhibition by insulin. To investigate whether a similar neutralization was found at the level of cAMP, platelets were treated with epinephrine and thrombin followed by PGI2 with or without 5 min of preincubation with insulin (100 nmol/liter) (Fig. 8B). Epinephrine alone or in combination with insulin abolished the rise in [cAMP] induced by PGI2. Since insulin alone did not change PGI2-induced cAMP increases (Fig. 4B), these changes are caused by epinephrine. Thrombin induced a 73% fall in [cAMP], and this fall increased further in the presence of epinephrine. Again, the effect of insulin on the decrease in [cAMP] induced by thrombin completely disappeared when epinephrine was present. Collectively, these data illustrate that epinephrine abolishes the effect of insulin on the regulation of cAMP. To investigate whether epinephrine interfered with insulin at the level of Giα2, an immunoprecipitation was performed using a 4G10 anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of Giα2 was measured on Western blot. Insulin induced a dose-dependent increase in Giα2 tyrosine phosphorylation. This increase was completely abolished by epinephrine (Fig. 8C). To determine whether epinephrine interfered with insulin signaling at the level of the insulin receptor, the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor β subunit was measured. Insulin increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the β subunit, which was abolished by the addition of epinephrine. Preincubation with sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of protein-tyrosine phosphatases, partially reversed the effects of epinephrine on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (Fig. 8D). These findings indicate that epinephrine neutralizes the inhibition by insulin by blocking the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Giα2 and the insulin receptor β subunit. Effect of Insulin on Platelet Aggregation in PRP—To address the question whether this mechanism was also functional in PRP, an aggregation assay was performed at 37 °C. PRP was preincubated for 2 min with 1 nmol/liter insulin and 10 μmol/liter epinephrine was added 1 min prior to initiation of aggregation with 10 μmol/liter ADP. Epinephrine enhanced the aggregation response to ADP. Insulin inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation without affecting the shape change response. The addition of epinephrine neutralized the inhibition of insulin such that the difference in platelet aggregation proved not to be significant (Fig. 9). These results illustrate that platelet inhibition by insulin is also present in PRP. Sensitivity of Ca2+Increases to Inhibition by cAMP—As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 3, ADP-induced Ca2+ rises were inhibited following a short (about 5 min) incubation with 1 nmol/liter insulin. In contrast, inhibition of thrombin-induced Ca2+ rises required a longer (about 10 min) incubation with a higher dose of insulin (100 nmol/liter). To investigate whether this difference was caused by a factor downstream of the formation of cAMP, Ca2+ increas"

In the present study, the role of the PDZ binding motif in ROMK function is explored. Here we identify the Na/H exchange regulatory factors, NHERF-1 and NHERF-2, as PDZ domain interaction partners of the ROMK channel. Characterization of the basis and consequences of NHERF association with ROMK reveals a PDZ interaction-dependent trafficking process and a coupling mechanism for linking ROMK to a channel modifier protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR). As measured by antibody binding of external epitope-tagged forms of Kir 1.1 in intact cells, NHERF-1 or NHERF-2 coexpression increased cell surface expression of ROMK. Channel interaction with NHERF proteins and effects of NHERF on ROMK localization were dependent on the presence of the PDZ domain binding motif in ROMK. Both NHERF proteins contain two PDZ domains; recombinant protein-protein binding assays and yeast-two-hybrid studies revealed that ROMK preferentially associates with the second PDZ domain of NHERF-1 and with the first PDZ domain of NHERF-2, precisely opposite of what has been reported for CFTR. Consistent with the scaffolding capacity of the NHERF proteins, coexpression of NHERF-2 with ROMK and CFTR dramatically increases the amount of ROMK protein that coimmunopurifies and functionally interacts with CFTR. Thus NHERF facilitates assembly of a ternary complex containing ROMK and CFTR.

We and others found that coexpression of CFTR with ROMK in Xenopus oocytes leads to the formation of weakly inward rectifying channels that have acquired sensitivity to sulfonylurea agents (14McNicholas C.M.

Certainly, the concept has precedent with an ever growing body of data, demonstrating that CFTR not only functions as a Cl- channel but also acts as a “conductance regulator,” modulating a plethora of different epithelial transport proteins (19Schwiebert E.M.

PDZ domains are 80-90-amino acid residue protein interaction modules that generally bind to short motifs (type I PDZ binding motif is recognized by the sequence S/T-X-I/V/L/M) found at the extreme COOH-terminal tail of certain membrane proteins and cytoplasmic signal transduction molecules to organize multiprotein complex formation on specific membrane domains (24Gomperts S.N.

Interestingly, the COOH-terminal domain of ROMK1-3 channels also contains a canonical type I PDZ binding motif (TQM-COOH). We recently reported that the PDZ binding sequence is a determinant of ROMK channel function, being required for efficient expression of active ROMK channels on the plasma membrane (32Flagg T.P. Yoo D. Sciortino C.M. Tate M. Romero M.F. Welling P.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 544: 351-362Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that trafficking of ROMK and interaction with CFTR are linked by a common PDZ domain-based scaffold. The goal of the present study was to test this hypothesis. Here we show that ROMK associates directly with NHERF-1 and NHERF-2 through a PDZ binding interaction to facilitate expression of ROMK on the plasmalemma and to coordinate the assembly ROMK and CFTR into a ternary complex. DNA Constructs—cDNAs encoding ROMK2 cytoplasmic COOH-terminal regions (amino acids 307-372 or 307-369) were amplified by PCR from a full-length template (GenBank NM017023) and cloned in-frame with GST in the fusion expression vector pGEX-5x (Amersham Biosciences) or with LexA in pJK202 for GST and yeast two-hybrid studies, respectively. The cDNAs encoding PDZ domains of NHERF-1 (NM004252) and NHERF-2 (AF035771), as indicated under “Results,” were amplified by PCR from full-length templates and cloned in-frame with either a hexahistidine sequence in the pRSET plasmid (Invitrogen) or with a trans-activation domain in the pJG4-5 plasmid for generation of recombinant His-tagged NHERF PDZ proteins and prey proteins for yeast two-hybrid studies, respectively. All constructs used for studies in Xenopus oocytes were subcloned between the 5′- and 3′-untranslated region of the Xenopus β-globin gene in the modified pSD64 vector to increase expression efficiency (33Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). This vector also contains a polyadenylate sequence in the 3′-untranslated region (dA23dC30). With the exception of EGFP-ROMK, all constructs used for mammalian expression were subcloned into pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). EGFP was engineered onto the NH2 terminus of wild-type or HA-ROMK2 by subcloning the wild-type or epitope-tagged ROMK2 in-frame with EGFP in the pEGFP-Cl vector (Clontech Clontech). The sequence of all amplified or modified cDNAs was confirmed by dye termination DNA sequencing (University of Maryland School of Medicine Biopolymer Core). Cell Culture and Transfections—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cells were transfected with 1-2 μg of plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or Gene Juice (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's specifications. GST Affinity Chromatography—GST-ROMK COOH-terminal fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli (Top Ten, Stratagene), and purified under nondenaturing conditions using glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Rat kidney or COS-7 cell extracts were prepared by homogenization in cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA), containing a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) and either 1% Triton X-100 or 1% CHAPS. After centrifugation of the detergent-solubilized lysates at 15,000 × g, the supernatant was collected and incubated with the GST fusion proteins (∼25 μg) bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h with gentle rocking, beads were washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline and four times with TEE (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). Protein bound to beads was eluted in SDS-sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and then processed for silver staining (Bio-Rad, Silver Stain Plus) or for immunoblotting. For the latter, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences) and probed with either a rabbit anti-NHERF antibody (34Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) at 1:250) or a rat monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (either donkey anti-rabbit IgG or goat-anti mouse IgG at 1:10,000 (Jackson Laboratory). An enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) was used as recommended by the manufacturer to detect bound antibodies. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—48 h post-transfection, COS cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in cold lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5, mm EDTA), pelleted (2, 000 × g for 5 min), and resuspended (∼5 times the cell pellet volume) in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton and a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml antipain, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A). Cells were then passed though a 27-gauge needle, rotated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then centrifuged at 15, 000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Soluble fractions from COS cells were precleared using 100 μl of a 50% Sepharose B slurry at 4 °C for 2 h with rotation. Precleared COS cell lysates were then rotated overnight with 100 μl of a 10% protein A/G slurry with either 2 μg of rabbit anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or mouse monoclonal anti-CFTR R (R & D Systems) or an unrelated IgG. After washing three times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, the immunoprecipitates from COS cells were eluted for 30 min at room temperature with SDS-sample buffer. Eluates were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. For Western blotting, a rabbit anti-ROMK antibody was used as described before (35Ecelbarger C.A. Kim G.H. Knepper M.A. Liu J. Tate M. Welling P.A. Wade J.B. J. Am Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 10-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson Laboratory) for detection with the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells, grown on glass coverslips, were transfected as above. After 2 days, cells were washed in ice-cold modified Ringer's solution (144 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm HEPES, 7.4) and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in Ringer's solution for 15 min at 4 °C. For colocalization studies of EGFP-ROMK2 and HA-tagged NHERF, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times in the modified Ringer's solution before blocking. For the external HA epitope EGFP-tagged ROMK surface expression studies, cells were not treated with Triton. Both groups were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in the modified Ringer's solution for 30 min at room temperature and labeled with primary antibody in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) at 10 ng/ml) for 3 h at room temperature, then washed in modified Ringer's solution three times. Next, cells were incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to either ALEXA 568 (goat anti-rat 1:100, Molecular Probes) in 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides were then washed and mounted onto slides in VectaShield and sealed with nail polish. Cells were visualized using a 410 Zeiss laser scanning confocal microscope under a 63× oil immersion lens. Images were acquired at zoom of 2 and pinhole size of 18 using 16-frame averaging and processed with Adobe Photoshop. Images of anti-HA cell surface labeling were collected at a constant gain and contrast for all samples. Cell Surface Expression Assay—The surface luminescence of COS-7 cells was measured as described previously by Sharma et al. (36Sharma N. Crane A. Clement J.P. Gonzalez G. Babenko A.P. Bryan J. Aguilar-Bryan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20628-20632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, transfected COS-7 cells were washed twice in ice-cold Ringer's solution and then labeled with 0.2 μg/ml rat anti-HA monoclonal antibody in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm HEPES) for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three or four times in ice-cold Tris-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 followed by incubation in horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rat antibody at 0.8 μg/ml. Cells were washed once in TBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+ then twice in TBS containing 2 mm EGTA. Once washed, the cells were detached, pelleted, and resuspended in Ringer's solution. Aliquots of the resuspended cells were added to 100 μl of Super Signal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay substrate (Pierce), incubated for 30 s at room temperature, and luminescence was measured using a Sirius luminometer. Gel Overlays—Interaction between the NHERF-1 PDZ domains and the ROMK2 COOH terminus was determined in vitro by performing an overlay assay of recombinant protein fragments following the methods of Wyszynski and Sheng (37Wyszynski M. Sheng M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). His-tagged NHERF protein fragments were produced in E. coli, purified to homogeneity under nondenaturing conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid spin columns (Qiagen), and used to probe for interaction with immobilized GST-ROMK2 COOH-terminal fusion proteins. GST and the GST-ROMK2 proteins (∼10 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% SDS-acrylamide) and transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins, immobilized on the filter, were renatured in gradually decreasing concentrations of guanidine HCl (from 6 m to zero), blocked with 5% milk in buffer B (120 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.2% Triton X-100), and then overlaid with His-tagged NHERF domains (5 μg/ml) in buffer B containing 5% milk. After incubation with the probes at room temperature for 30 min, membranes were washed three times with buffer B to remove spurious binding as described previously (37Wyszynski M. Sheng M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 371-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Blots were then probed with anti-His antibody followed by donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase at 1:10,000 (Amersham Biosciences). An enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences) was used as recommended by the manufacturer to detect bound His-tag probe. Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Studies—The yeast two-hybrid interaction trap system was used according to established methods (38Gyuris J. Golemis E.A. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar, 39Golemis E.A. Khazak V. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 63: 197-218PubMed Google Scholar) to test for interactions between the ROMK2 COOH terminus and the PDZ domains in NHERF-1 and NHERF-2. In these studies, a LexA fusion protein of either a wild-type ROMK COOH terminus (amino acids 307-372) or a truncated mutant ROMK COOH terminus (amino-acids 307-369X) was used as bait (in pJK202 containing a His selectable marker). Conditionally expressed NHERF PDZ domains in the pJG4-5 plasmid (Trp selectable marker) were used as prey. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (EGY48, Mat a-ura3, his3, trp1, ura3, 3lexAop-leu2) was transfected with the wild-type and mutant baits and the PDZ domains and then plated onto selection plates to screen for yeast that were transfected with prey, baits, and reporter constructs. In this system, the interaction of library and bait proteins causes the transcriptional activation of lacZ. To determine the relative strength of the interactions, β-galactosidase activity was measured at Vmax using the o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG) solution assay according to established methods (40Mendelsohn A.R. Brent R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 482-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because the interaction trap uses Gal-inducible promoter to express the prey protein conditionally, yeast were grown (A600 of 0.9-1.2) under conditions that induce (2% galactose and 1% raffinose) or repress (2% glucose) the promoter. Yeast cultures were pelleted (2,000 × g) and resuspended in 750 μl of Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol). For the assay, 100 μl of the Z buffer cell suspension was added to 900 μl of Z buffer in glass culture tubes containing 10 μl of 0.1% SDS and 20 μl of chloroform. Tubes were vortexed for 15 s and equilibrated at 30 °C for 15 min. After equilibration, 200 μl of stock 4 mg/ml ONPG was added to the samples and vortexed for 5 s. Reactions were stopped at 30 s-4 min by adding 0.5 ml of 1 m Na2CO3, centrifuged to pellet debris, and the reaction product was measured by spectrofluorometery. Miller units were calculated as described previously (41Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Dorris D. Keaveney M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1997: 13.6.1-13.6.6Google Scholar). Results represent the average of at least four independent clones, repeated in duplicate. cRNA Synthesis—Complementary RNA was transcribed in vitro in the presence of capping analogue G(5′)ppp(5′) from linearized plasmids containing the cDNA of interest using SP6 RNA polymerase (mMessage Machine, Ambion Inc.). cRNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitated with ammonium acetate/isopropyl alcohol. Yield was quantified spectrophotometrically and confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Oocyte Isolation and Injection—Oocytes from selected female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus Express, Homosassa, FL) were isolated and maintained using the standard procedures as described previously (42Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar). Although the recombinant ROMK channel, as expressed in Xenopus oocytes, has been reported to by some investigators to exhibit sensitivity to the sulfonylurea KATP channel blocker glibenclamide (43Konstas A.A. Dabrowski M. Korbmacher C. Tucker S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21346-21351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we and others (44Zhou H. Tate S.S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have found that the response is modest, highly variable, and dependent on oocyte donor, suggesting the involvement of inconsistently expressed factors in the oocyte (44Zhou H. Tate S.S. Palmer L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C809-C824Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, to study the effects of CFTR and NHERF on ROMK in the present study, we used a stock of frogs that was prescreened for lack of glibenclamide effects on expressed ROMK. Briefly, frogs were anesthetized with 0.15% 3-aminobenzoate and a partial oophorectomy was performed through an abdominal incision. Oocyte aggregates were manually dissected from the ovarian lobes and then incubated in OR-2 medium (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) containing collagenase (type 3, Worthington) for 2 hat room temperature to remove the follicular layer. After extensive washing with collagenase-free OR-2, oocytes were stored at 19 °C in OR-3 medium (50% Leibovitz medium, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). 12-24 h later, healthy looking Dumont stage V-VI oocytes were injected pneumatically with 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water containing ROMK2, CFTR, and/or NHERF-2 cRNA, and then stored in OR-3 medium at 19 °C for 2-6 days. Electrophysiology—Whole cell currents in Xenopus oocytes were monitored using a two-microelectrode voltage clamp as described previously (42Welling P.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F825-F836PubMed Google Scholar, 45Flagg T.P. Tate M. Merot J. Welling P.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) under conditions in which potassium currents, carried through ROMK, could be isolated. In all studies, we purposely excluded endogenous cAMP analogs or activators to prevent CFTR Cl- channel activation. Briefly, oocytes were bathed in a 5 mm potassium, low Cl solution (5 mm KCl, 45 mm sodium gluconate, 1 mm MgCl2. 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Voltage sensing and current injecting microelectrodes had resistances of 0.5-1.5 megohms when back-filled with 3 m KCl. Once a stable membrane potential was attained, oocytes were clamped to a holding"
https://openalex.org/W1969798346,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and retinoic acid (RA) are important regulators of cell growth and differentiation. The TGF-beta receptors utilize Smad proteins to transduce signals intracellularly and regulate transcription of target genes, either directly or in combination with other sequence-specific transcription factors. Two classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and the retinoic X receptors, are involved in mediating transcriptional responses to RA. Given the known interactions between the TGF-beta and RAR pathways, we have investigated the role played by RAR ligands in modulating functional interactions between Smad3 and RARs. Using transient cell transfection experiments with an artificial Smad3/Smad4-dependent reporter construct, we demonstrate that RAR overexpression enhances Smad-driven transactivation, an effect that requires both Smad3 and Smad4. We provide evidence that RAR effect on Smad3/Smad4-driven transcription is prevented by natural and synthetic RAR agonists, and potentiated by synthetic RAR antagonists. The activity of two TGF-beta-responsive human gene promoter constructs was regulated in a parallel fashion. Using both mammalian two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation/Western methods, we demonstrate a direct interaction between the region DEF of RARgamma and the MH2 domain of Smad3, inhibited by RAR agonists and enhanced by their antagonists. We propose that RARs may function as coactivators of the Smad pathway in the absence of RAR agonists or in the presence of their antagonists, a phenomenon that contrasts with their known role as agonist-activated transcriptional regulators of RA-dependent genes."

https://openalex.org/W1997193719,"Oncostatin-M (OSM), a hematopoietic cytokine, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a quintessential angiogenic signal, are coexpressed in development, cancer and inflammation. Here, we report that OSM treatment of human astroglioma cell lines increases VEGF levels by approximately threefold. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), in combination with OSM, induces up to sevenfold higher VEGF expression, without significantly inducing VEGF on its own. Specifically examining the OSM contribution to VEGF expression, neutralizing antibodies to OSM receptor subunits gp130 and OSMRbeta, but not LIFRbeta, inhibited OSM induction of VEGF, indicating that the OSM-specific receptor OSMRbeta/gp130 transduces the OSM signal for VEGF synthesis. OSM induction of VEGF promoter activity maps to the (-1171, -786) region of the VEGF promoter, which contains a STAT-3-binding site. STAT-3 is indeed essential for this response, since overexpression of a dominant-negative STAT-3 blocks OSM induction of VEGF promoter activity, as well as endogenous VEGF expression. Finally, we demonstrate that OSM is expressed in glioblastoma multiforme tumor biopsies, a particularly malignant form of brain tumor. This novel mechanism of VEGF regulation in astroglioma cells may be active in pathophysiological states where both OSM and IL-1beta are present."
https://openalex.org/W2047586374,"Two secretases are involved in the generation of amyloid β-peptide, the principal component of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. While β-secretase is a classical aspartyl protease, γ-secretase activity is associated with a high molecular weight complex. One of the complex components, which is critically required for γ-secretase activity is nicastrin (NCT). Here we investigate the assembly of NCT into the γ-secretase complex. NCT mutants either lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail, the cytoplasmic tail, and the transmembrane domain (TMD), or containing a set of heterologous TMDs were expressed in cells with strongly reduced levels of endogenous NCT. Maturation of exogenous NCT, γ-secretase complex formation and proteolytic function was then investigated. This revealed that the cytoplasmic tail of NCT is dispensable for γ-secretase complex assembly and function. In contrast, the authentic TMD of NCT is critically required for the interaction with γ-secretase complex components and for formation of an active γ-secretase complex. Neither soluble NCT lacking any membrane anchor nor NCT containing a heterologous TMD were inserted into the γ-secretase complex. We identified the N-terminal region of the NCT TMD as a functionally important entity of NCT. These data thus demonstrate that NCT interacts with other γ-secretase complex components via its TMD. Two secretases are involved in the generation of amyloid β-peptide, the principal component of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. While β-secretase is a classical aspartyl protease, γ-secretase activity is associated with a high molecular weight complex. One of the complex components, which is critically required for γ-secretase activity is nicastrin (NCT). Here we investigate the assembly of NCT into the γ-secretase complex. NCT mutants either lacking the entire cytoplasmic tail, the cytoplasmic tail, and the transmembrane domain (TMD), or containing a set of heterologous TMDs were expressed in cells with strongly reduced levels of endogenous NCT. Maturation of exogenous NCT, γ-secretase complex formation and proteolytic function was then investigated. This revealed that the cytoplasmic tail of NCT is dispensable for γ-secretase complex assembly and function. In contrast, the authentic TMD of NCT is critically required for the interaction with γ-secretase complex components and for formation of an active γ-secretase complex. Neither soluble NCT lacking any membrane anchor nor NCT containing a heterologous TMD were inserted into the γ-secretase complex. We identified the N-terminal region of the NCT TMD as a functionally important entity of NCT. These data thus demonstrate that NCT interacts with other γ-secretase complex components via its TMD. Secretases are protease activities known to be required for proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). 1The abbreviations used are: βAPPβ-amyloid precursor proteinAβamyloid β-peptideADAlzheimer's DiseasePSpresenilinNCTnicastrinTMDtransmembrane domainHEKhuman embryonic kidneyRNAiRNA interferenceCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidCHAPSO3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acidAICDAPP intracellular domainwtwild typesiRNAsmall interfering RNACTFC-terminal fragment.1The abbreviations used are: βAPPβ-amyloid precursor proteinAβamyloid β-peptideADAlzheimer's DiseasePSpresenilinNCTnicastrinTMDtransmembrane domainHEKhuman embryonic kidneyRNAiRNA interferenceCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidCHAPSO3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acidAICDAPP intracellular domainwtwild typesiRNAsmall interfering RNACTFC-terminal fragment. βAPP is the precursor for the neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide (Aβ), the principal component of amyloid plaques invariantly found in all Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brains (1Hardy J.

Apparently the highly insoluble Aβ aggregates immediately after its proteolytic generation by secretases and forms oligomers, which are the main pathological players in the disease (3Walsh D.M.

Thus understanding secretase function is not only of great academic interest but will also help to develop therapeutic strategies against AD.Two secretases are involved in Aβ generation. The first cut is mediated at the Met/Asp bond at amino acid one of the Aβ peptide by β-site APP cleaving enzyme. β-Site APP cleaving enzyme is a membrane-bound protease, which contains the classical active sites of aspartyl proteases (4Vassar R.

In contrast γ-secretase activity is associated with a high molecular weight protein complex (5Capell A. Grunberg J. Pesold B. Diehlmann A. Citron M. Nixon R. Beyreuther K. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. J.

PS mutations were shown to affect Aβ generation in a pathological manner by increasing the production of the 42 amino acid Aβ42, which tends to oligomerize much faster than the regular 40 amino acid Aβ40 (7Haass C.

To identify domains of NCT required for complex assembly we investigated NCT variants, which either lack the cytoplasmic tail, the complete transmembrane domain (TMD) and the cytoplasmic tail thus generating a soluble NCT variant, or containing a heterologous TMD. We demonstrate that NCT preferentially interacts via the N-terminal half of its TMD with other γ-secretase complex components and does not require the cytoplasmic domain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK 293) stably expressing swAPP and the NCT knockdown cell line were described previously (26Shirotani K.

The polyclonal antibody against the N terminus of NCT (αNCT-NT, 1658) was raised against a MBPNCT (amino acids 320–420) fusion protein, and the C-terminal NCT antibody was obtained from Sigma (N1660). The monoclonal antibodies against Aβ (6E10), the V5 tag, and the penta-His tag were obtained from Senetek and Invitrogen, respectively.Protein Analysis—Cell lysates were prepared using STEN lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA).

Briefly, CHAPSO cell lysates (2% CHAPSO, 150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4) were immunoprecipitated with αV5 antibody or αPS1-loop antibody (3027), the beads were incubated for 14 h with 0.75 μg of purified recombinant APP-C100, C-terminally histidine-tagged (C100-His6)in20 μl of assay buffer (150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, 0.25% CHAPSO, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, 10 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics, as recommended)). Aβ and APP intracellular domain (AICD) were detected by Western blot analysis.RESULTSTo determine whether the cytoplasmic tail or the TMD of NCT plays a critical role for γ-secretase complex assembly and function, we generated the deletion constructs ΔC NCT-V5 (lacking the cytoplasmic domain) and sNCT-V5 (a soluble NCT variant, which lacks the cytoplasmic domain and the TMD). In addition the TMD of wt NCT was also replaced by the TMD of ADAM-10 to create the NCT variant TMA10NCT-V5 (Fig. 1A). These constructs as well as wt NCT-V5 were stably transfected into a HEK 293 cell line stably expressing Swedish mutant APP (swAPP) and a pSUPER-based NCT-1045 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-encoding vector, which stably knocks down endogenous NCT expression by RNAi (16Edbauer D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 16474-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) endogenous NCT expression was dramatically decreased by RNAi (Fig. 1B, lane 2). This is accompanied by reduced PS1, APH-1aL, and PEN-2 expression and a significant increase of the βAPP C-terminal fragments (CTFs) followed by reduced Aβ generation (Fig. 1C, lane 2). In cells expressing wt NCT-V5 (26Shirotani K. Edbauer D. Capell A. Schmitz J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16474-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) the biochemical phenotype of the NCT knockdown was rescued (Fig. 1C). The βAPP CTFs were reduced to normal levels and Aβ production was restored demonstrating normal γ-secretase function (Fig. 1C). In total lysates maturation of wt NCT-V5 was observed (Fig. 1B), which is consistent with the functional restoration of γ-secretase activity (16Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 19Leem J.Y. Vijayan S. Han P. Cai D. Machura M. Lopes K.O. Veselits M.L. Xu H. Thinakaran G. J. Biol.

J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). NCT maturation was also observed in cells expressing the ΔC NCT-V5 variant, although to a slightly lesser extent than wt NCT (Fig. 1B). ΔC NCT-V5 rescued the loss of γ-secretase function caused by the RNAi mediated knockdown of endogenous NCT. Similar to wt NCT, ΔC NCT-V5 rescued PS1, APH-1aL, and PEN-2 expression, reduced APP CTF levels, and restored Aβ generation (Fig. 1C) demonstrating efficient γ-secretase complex assembly and function. In contrast, the NCT variants TMA10NCT-V5 and sNCT-V5 entirely failed to maturate (Fig. 1B, panel αV5) and to restore expression of PS1 fragments, AHP-1aL and PEN-2 (Fig. 1C). Consequently, they did not reduce APP CTF accumulation and failed to restore Aβ production (Fig. 1C).Thus the authentic TMD of NCT is apparently necessary for NCT function and γ-secretase complex formation whereas the cytoplasmic tail of NCT is dispensable. To identify a critical region within the NCT TMD required for complex formation, short domains of the NCT TMD were sequentially replaced with that of ADAM-10 (Fig. 2A). Chimeras replacing one-third (TM-NNA) or two-thirds (TM-NAA) of the C-terminal region of the authentic NCT TMD with the corresponding transmembrane sequences of ADAM-10 were able to maturate (Fig. 2B). To further prove if the N-terminal region of the NCT TMD is required for maturation of NCT and γ-secretase complex assembly, three additional chimeras (TM-ANA, TM-ANN, TMAAN; Fig. 2A) were expressed in the NCT knockdown cell line described above. No maturation was observed when the NCT variants TM-ANA or TM-AAN were expressed. In contrast some mature NCT could be detected in cells expressing NCT TM-ANN chimera (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that the N-terminal third of the NCT TMD is sufficient for maturation of NCT. However, the middle part of the TM domain also contributes to maturation to some extent, since TM-ANN clearly restored maturation although at low levels. In addition TM-NNA appears to maturate to a higher extent than TM-NAA. Although the Nct variant TM-NNA maturated most efficiently of all constructs tested it is still unable to maturate as efficiently as wt NCT (Fig. 2B). To further prove assembly of these NCT variants into a γ-secretase complex co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. αPS1-loop antibody co-immunoprecipitated all NCT chimeras that undergo maturation (Fig. 2C). These include the NCT variants wt, ΔC, TM-NAA, and TM-NNA. Consistent with the results shown above small amounts of the mature NCT variant TM-ANN were also coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 2C). In all these cases the mature species of NCT variants were preferentially co-precipitated (Fig. 2C) as expected (16Edbauer D. Winkler E. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8666-8671Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). As discussed above, the NCT variants ΔC, TM-NAA, and TM-NNA showed less coimunoprecipitation with PS1 as compared with wt NCT (Fig. 2C). These data were supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using the αV5 antibody to exogenous NCT. The NCT variants wt, ΔC, TM-NAA, TM-NNA, and to a weaker extent TM-ANN co-immunoprecipitated the PS1 C-terminal fragment (Fig. 2D). Again, NCT TM-NNA co-immunoprecipitated the PS1 fragment to a lesser extent than wt NCT (Fig. 2D). Co-immunoprecipitation of APH-1aL occurred with wt NCT, ΔC, TM-NAA, and TM-NNA, confirming assembly into a functional γ-secretase complex (see also Fig. 3). Since TM-ANN is the chimera with the weakest PS interaction, the APH-1aL interaction is apparently below detection limit (Fig. 2D). This is supported by our finding that NCT-ANN does exhibit γ-secretase activity in a highly sensitive in vitro assay (Fig. 3; see below).Fig. 2The N-terminal one-third of the TMD is sufficient for complex incorporation of NCT.A, sequence of the NCT (gray box) and ADAM-10 TMD (hatched box) chimeras.

CHAPSO cell lysates were prepared and γ-secretase complexes containing exogenous NCT were selectively immunoprecipitated with αV5 antibody. As a control, endogenous γ-secretase was precipitated from CHAPSO lysates of HEK cells expressing swAPP, using the αPS1-loop antibody (lanes 1 and 2).

To rule out any γ-secretase activity contributed by remaining small amounts of endogenous complexes, CHAPSO lysates of the indicated cell lines were immunoprecipitated using the αV5 antibody. All constructs, which allowed NCT maturation and incorporation into the complex (wt, ΔC, TM-NAA, TM-NNA, TM-ANN), efficiently restored Aβ and AICD generation (Fig. 3). The highly sensitive γ-secretase assay revealed very low levels of activity upon expression of TM-AAN or TM-ANA (Fig. 3). This is consistent with our finding that very minor amounts of co-immunoprecipitating PS1 fragments could be observed (Fig. 2D; longer exposure). Thus the N-terminal region of the NCT TMD is sufficient for assembly of NCT into the γ-secretase complex. However, the remaining middle part together with the N-terminal or C-terminal third of the TMD also contributes the NCT incorporation, suggesting structural requirements within the authentic TMD (see Fig. 4 and “Discussion”).Fig. 4A helical wheel projection containing the 18 N-terminal amino acids of the TMD of wt NCT and the TMD swap constructs, using the following program: cti.itc.virginia.edu/~cmg/Demo/wheel/wheelApp.html.

https://openalex.org/W2025677435,"To investigate the possible role of inhibiting NF-kB activation in sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, we transfected the dominant-negative mutant inhibitor of NF-kB (IkBm) into the EU-1 cell line, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) line with constitutive NF-kB activation. Overexpression of IkBm significantly reduced constitutive NF-kB activity in EU-1 cells, resulting in decreased cell growth. In response to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs, IkBm-transfected cells (EU-1/IkBm) exhibited increased sensitivity to vincristine (VCR), whereas sensitivity to doxorubicin (Dox) was not changed as compared to neo-transfected control (EU-1/neo) cells. To further evaluate the link between IkBm and sensitivity to Dox and VCR, we demonstrated that both endogenous IkBalpha and ectopic IkBm bind to p53. In response to Dox, the cytosolic p53.IkBalpha complex rapidly dissociated due to downregulation of IkBalpha. However, the p53.IkBm complex did not dissociate under these conditions. Although treatment of EU-1/IkBm cells with Dox increased the expression of p53, the nondissociating p53.IkBm complex resulted in decreased p53 function, as demonstrated by absence of cell-cycle arrest and induction of p53 target genes. Contrastingly, VCR-induced cell death neither downregulated IkBalpha nor induced p53, as shown by the lack of NF-kB activation and p53-mediated gene expression in VCR-treated cells. Our data suggest that IkBm simultaneously downregulates NF-kB activation and sequesters p53 in the cytoplasm, thus enhancing NF-kB-regulated apoptosis but blocking p53-dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2050179520,"Many studies have now established that the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes are involved in activation and repression of a variety of genes. In mammalian cells, these complexes contain the BRM and BRG1 helicase-like proteins that are thought to be responsible for nucleosome remodelling. The proto-oncoprotein SYT, involved in the unique translocation t(X;18) found in synovial sarcoma, is known to interact with human BRM (hBRM), thus providing a link between chromatin remodelling factors and human cancer. In this work, we address how SYT interacts with hBRM and BRG1. We demonstrate that the conserved N-terminal SNH domain of SYT, which is also present in the oncoproteins SYT-SSX, binds to both hBRM and BRG1. We have also found that in vivo the C-terminus transactivation QPGY region of SYT can interact with itself. This results in an amplified interaction with hBRM and highlights a possible regulatory function of this domain in cells."

CD40 engagement has been shown to cooperate with BCR signals particularly in the germinal center reaction, where follicular dendritic cells present antigen and T helper cells provide CD154. Additionally, detailed analysis of the phenotypic differences between naïve, germinal center, and memory cells show that CD40 and other tumor necrosis factor receptor family members are up-regulated in germinal center cells compared with naïve B cells (8.Feldhahn N.

Previous studies from our laboratory identified TRAF2 and TRAF3 in the CD40 signaling pathway and BCR-induced PKD activation as playing important roles in the cross-talk between these receptors (10.Haxhinasto S.A.

Because BCR signaling activates a number of kinases, we hypothesized that BCR-mediated TRAF phosphorylation might be important for the synergy. Site-directed mutagenesis of TRAF2 identified the potentially phosphorylatable tyrosine 484 as a critical residue for the synergy and led us to investigate the potential involvement of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), a tyrosine kinase, in this process. Our data showed a role for Btk in the synergy, and this was PKD- and TRAF2-dependent. This work together with previous findings provides a model for BCR-CD40 synergy whereby BCR-mediated activation of Btk and PKD modifies TRAF2 in a manner that allows it to block an inhibitory effect mediated by TRAF3.

Assays for B Cell Function—IgM-secreting cells per million recovered viable cells were measured at 72 h of incubation by quantitation on a lawn of sheep red blood cells using a direct plaque assay as previously described (18.Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 1107-1114PubMed Google Scholar). Inducible PKD, Btk, or TRAF expression was initiated by the addition of IPTG to cultures 18 h before the addition of stimuli. All stimulations proceeded for a total of 72 h, including the time of IPTG incubation. For proliferation studies 1 × 105 cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml anti-μ and/or anti-CD40 Abs for 72 h. Five to six h before harvesting, 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well, and incorporation was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For measurement of IL-6 secretion, 1 × 105 splenic B cells were stimulated with Chinese hamster ovary mCD154 cells (1–5 × 103) for 48 h with various stimuli. Anti-CD40 monoclonal Abs could not be used as stimuli in this assay because our previous studies show that IL-6 production, unlike IgM secretion, requires CD40 stimulation by membrane-bound CD154 (16.Baccam M. Bishop G.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3855-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). IL-6 ELISA was performed as described previously (16.Baccam M. Bishop G.A. Eur. J.

Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—CH12.LX cells (5–10 × 106) were stimulated with 10 μg/ml anti-mouse μ-chain specific F(ab′)2 and/or anti-mCD40 for the indicated times. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.02% NaN3, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors) for 30 min. The supernatants were incubated with protein G beads preconjugated with appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed. Preparation of 32P-Labeled Lysates—CH12.LX cells lacking TRAF2 or inducibly expressing FLAG-tagged WT-TRAF2 were labeled as previously described (10.Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated with 10 μg/ml goat anti-mouse μ-chain specific F(ab′)2 and/or mCD154 expressing HI-5 cells for 15 min. Cells were lysed, and TRAF2 was immunoprecipitated. Autoradiography was performed to detect TRAF2. TRAF2 Dependence of PKD Enhancement of the CD40 Response—Our previous work has shown that BCR and CD40 synergize in B cell activation in a TRAF2-dependent manner (10.Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A mutant hCD40 molecule, hCD40T234A, that binds TRAF3 normally but shows reduced binding to TRAF2 fails to synergize with BCR signals (10.Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17.Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). Using pharmacological PKD inhibitors and a dominant-negative PKD molecule to block PKD activity, we also identified PKD as a necessary factor in the BCR-CD40 synergy (11.Haxhinasto S.A. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4655-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Collectively these data support the hypothesis that PKD activation may cooperate with TRAF2 to promote synergy between the BCR and CD40. To test this hypothesis, we stably expressed hCD40T234A in CH12.LX cells that can be induced (upon IPTG treatment) to express a constitutively active PKD (PKD-PHD-EE) and asked whether induced expression of this kinase could overcome the synergy defect of the hCD40T234A molecule. We have also previously shown that the transfected wild-type hCD40 and endogenous mCD40 signal indistinguishably in our B cell lines (17.Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar). As indicated in Fig. 1A, mCD40 synergizes with BCR in IgM secretion, and as previously shown (10.Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 17.Hostager B.S. Hsing Y. Harms D.E. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1047-1053PubMed Google Scholar), hCD40T234A does not synergize. Induced expression of PKD-PHD-EE substituted for the BCR signal in synergy with the WT endogenous mCD40. In contrast, PKD-PHD-EE expression was insufficient to replace the BCR signal in cooperating with hCD40T234A (Fig. 1A). Thus, PKD enhancement of the CD40 response is dependent upon the binding of TRAF2 to CD40. BCR Engagement and TRAF2 Phosphorylation—These studies support a critical role for a PKD-TRAF2 relationship in integration of the BCR and CD40 signals. We hypothesized that BCR-induced PKD activation might lead to modifications of TRAF2, which are important for the synergy. We focused our attention initially on the possible phosphorylation of TRAF2 after BCR and/or CD40 engagement. To examine the phosphorylation status of TRAF2, cells expressing inducible FLAG-tagged WT TRAF2 were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. The tagged construct was used because commercially available anti-mouse TRAF2 antibodies do not efficiently immunoprecipitate the protein. Analysis of immunoprecipitated TRAF2 from lysates of cells receiving various stimuli (Fig. 1B) show that TRAF2 was constitutively phosphorylated in B cells and that BCR engagement alone or in combination with anti-CD40 enhanced the phosphorylation of TRAF2. Interestingly, CD40 stimulation did not affect the phosphorylation status of TRAF2. Role of Conserved Serines in the CD40 Binding Site of TRAF2 in BCR-CD40 Synergy—To address the potential importance of TRAF2 phosphorylation in the synergy between BCR and CD40, we expressed a serine residue mutant of TRAF2 in TRAF2–/– CH12.LX B cells. As previously reported (15.Hostager B.S. Haxhinasto S.A. Rowland S.L. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45382-45390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), reconstitution of TRAF2-deficient B cells with WT TRAF2 restores the synergy between BCR and CD40. If phosphorylation of TRAF2 is critical for synergy, mutation of potentially phosphorylatable residues to nonphosphorylatable residues would abrogate this function. We used a computer program that predicts possible phosphorylatable sites (19.Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2536) Google Scholar) to identify potential candidate residues. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct a TRAF2 molecule in which serines 453 and 455 in the TRAF2 molecules were changed to alanines. These residues were selected on the basis of a predicted high probability that they could be phosphorylated, and both are highly conserved between various TRAFs and among TRAF2 molecules of different species (Fig. 2A). In addition these residues have been previously shown to be important in binding to CD40 by forming a “serine-tong” surrounding the CD40 residue Gln-232 (20.McWhirter S.M. Pullen S.S. Holton J.M. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8408-8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The SSAA-TRAF2 mutant was inducibly and stably expressed in TRAF2–/– B cells at levels similar to endogenous TRAF2, and its ability to restore synergy was examined. The SSAA-TRAF2 mutant was able to restore BCR-CD40 synergy in a similar fashion to WT TRAF2 (Fig. 2B). Thus, these serines do not play a significant role in synergy. Interestingly, the binding of this TRAF2 mutant to CD40 was not affected (Fig. 2C), as might have been predicted by previous studies (20.McWhirter S.M. Pullen S.S. Holton J.M. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Alber T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8408-8413Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), suggesting that the other “hot spots” may compensate in binding of TRAF2 to CD40 in B cells. Requirement for Tyrosine 484 of TRAF2 for BCR-CD40 Synergy—A TRAF2 molecule in which tyrosine 484 was mutated to phenylalanine was also constructed. Although PKD is a serine-threonine kinase, BCR signaling also leads to activation of a number of tyrosine kinases. Tyr-484 also has a very high probability of being phosphorylated (R = 0.930) and is highly conserved among TRAF molecules in mouse and human (Fig. 3A). The Y484F-TRAF2 mutant was stably and inducibly expressed in TRAF2–/– CH12.LX cells, and its ability to restore synergy was examined. Interestingly, although Y484F-TRAF2 was able to restore the CD40 response, it was not able to restore the synergy between BCR and CD40 (Fig. 3B). Upon CD40 engagement B cells produce TNF-α, which contributes to IgM secretion via engagement of CD120b/TNFR2 (21.Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3318-3322Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Both CD40 and CD120b associate with TRAF2, so it was possible that the observed defect was due to the inability of CD120b to utilize the Y484F-TRAF2 molecule. This was tested by stimulating cells with TNF-α and measuring the IgM response. As seen in Fig. 3C, the TNF-α response in cells expressing the Y484F-TRAF2 molecule is similar to that of the cells expressing WT-TRAF2, demonstrating that this mutation does not affect all TRAF2 effector functions. An alternate explanation for the failure of Y484F-TRAF2 to restore synergy could be inability to bind to CD40. It has previously been shown that binding of TRAF2 to CD40 is necessary for CD40-induced degradation of TRAF2 (22.Brown K.D. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 943-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) as well as that of TRAF3 (15.Hostager B.S. Haxhinasto S.A. Rowland S.L. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45382-45390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ability of Y484F-TRAF2 to undergo CD40-induced degradation was, thus, examined. As indicated in Fig. 3D, B cells expressing TRAF2 Y484F as the only TRAF2 molecule in the cell showed CD40-mediated degradation of both TRAF2 and TRAF3. However, the extent of degradation for either TRAF2 or TRAF3 was slightly impaired when compared with cells expressing WT-TRAF2, suggesting a potential involvement of Tyr-484 in this function. Finally, WT or Y484F TRAF2 bound to immunoprecipitated mCD40 to a similar extent (Fig. 3E). Therefore, the Y484F mutation specifically affects the synergy-related function(s) of TRAF2 without inhibiting its ability to bind to CD40, mediate signals generated by the CD120b receptor, or induce CD40-induced TRAF degradation. In addition, to examine the potential phosphorylation of this residue, we compared the phosphorylation status of WT-TRAF2 and Y484F-TRAF2 using 32P-labeling and phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. There was no detectable difference in phosphorylation between WT and Y484F-TRAF2 (data not shown), perhaps due to the minor contribution of this residue to the overall phosphorylation status of TRAF2. Overall, these data strongly support a necessary role for tyrosine at position 484 of TRAF2 in the synergy between BCR and CD40 and suggest the involvement of a protein-tyrosine kinase in the synergy. Role of Btk in BCR-CD40 Synergy—The data presented in Fig. 3 imply the involvement of a protein-tyrosine kinase in the synergy between CD40 and the BCR. BCR engagement leads to activation of several protein-tyrosine kinases, including Syk, Lyn, and Btk. It has been reported that Btk associates with PKD (23.Johannes F.J. Hausser A. Storz P. Truckenmuller L. Link G. Kawakami T. Pfizenmaier K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and PKD activation is diminished in Btk-deficient cells (3.Sidorenko S.P. Law C.L. Klaus S.J. Chandran K.A. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), however, the significance of such interaction is not clear. Mice containing the naturally occurring point mutation in the PH domain of Btk (R28C) display the xid phenotype, characterized by a block in B-cell development, impaired signaling, and reduced IgM and IgG3 levels (24.Satterthwaite A.B. Lowell C.A. Khan W.N. Sideras P. Alt F.W. Witte O.N. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 833-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although BCR engagement leads to Btk activation, the involvement of Btk in the CD40 response is not clear. In some reports the CD40 response is not affected by the xid mutation (25.Nonoyama S. Tsukada S. Yamadori T. Miyawaki T. Jin Y.Z. Watanabe C. Morio T. Yata J. Ochs H.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3925-3929PubMed Google Scholar), whereas others report a dependence of CD40 on Btk expression (26.Goldstein M.D. Debenedette M.A. Hollenbaugh D. Watts T.H. Mol. Immunol. 1996; 33: 541-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27.Khan W.N. Nilsson A. Mizoguchi E. Castigli E. Forsell J. Bhan A.K. Geha R. Sideras P. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mice lacking both Btk and CD40 (27.Khan W.N. Nilsson A. Mizoguchi E. Castigli E. Forsell J. Bhan A.K. Geha R. Sideras P. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) or simultaneously containing the xid and CD40 deficiency (28.Oka Y. Rolink A.G. Andersson J. Kamanaka M. Uchida J. Yasui T. Kishimoto T. Kikutani H. Melchers F. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1675-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) display a more profound B cell immunodeficiency than either of the single knockouts, suggesting a possible link between these molecules. We examined Btk activation upon BCR and CD40 engagement in CH12.LX cells. BCR engagement leads to Btk activation accompanied by autophosphorylation at Tyr-223 within the SH3 domain (29.Li Z. Wahl M.I. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13820-13825Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). BCR engagement led to Btk activation, whereas anti-CD40 treatment did not (Fig. 4). To address the role of Btk in the synergy between BCR and CD40, we inducibly and stably expressed WT-Btk, the xid dominant negative mutant R28C-Btk, and E41K-Btk, a constitutively active molecule that displays increased phosphorylation on tyrosine residues as well as increased membrane association (30.Li T. Tsukada S. Satterthwaite A. Havlik M.H. Park H. Takatsu K. Witte O.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 451-460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Induced stable expression of each at similar levels is shown in Fig. 5A. Interestingly, expression of WT-Btk enhanced the CD40-induced IgM secretion (Fig. 5B), and a more pronounced enhancement was observed when the E41K-Btk mutant was expressed (Fig. 5C). These data revealed that Btk regulates in part CD40-induced IgM secretion in CH12.LX B cells, consistent with the phenotype of xid mice (27.Khan W.N. Nilsson A. Mizoguchi E. Castigli E. Forsell J. Bhan A.K. Geha R. Sideras P. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither WT-Btk nor E41K-Btk completely substituted for BCR engagement in synergy between this receptor and CD40. BCR ligation enhanced the CD40 response above that observed with CD40 alone, even in the presence of Btk overexpression, pointing to the existence of additional BCR-induced factors involved in the synergy, such as PKD.Fig. 5Role of Btk in BCR-CD40 synergy. A, expression of Btk proteins. CH12.LacR cells stably transfected with the various Btkconstructs were cultured in 100 μm IPTG overnight to induce expression of the proteins.

N.S, nonspecific.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The expression of the xid mutant, R28C, abrogated the synergy between BCR and CD40 without affecting the CD40 response (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the R28C mutation specifically affects the BCR-signaling pathway and the interaction between BCR and CD40 signaling pathways. Additionally, we examined the contribution of Btk in the synergistic activation of splenic B cells from xid mice and WT mice. BCR and CD40 signals synergized in splenic B cell proliferation of B cells from WT mice (Fig. 6, A and B), as shown previously (9.Bishop G.A. Warren W.D. Berton M.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 1230-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 10.Haxhinasto S.A. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1145-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Confirming previous reports (27.Khan W.N. Nilsson A. Mizoguchi E. Castigli E. Forsell J. Bhan A.K. Geha R. Sideras P. Alt F.W. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), BCR engagement was defective in inducing proliferation of xid B cells (Fig. 6, A and B), whereas the CD40 response was unaffected. Despite the inability of BCR to induce proliferation of xid B cells, coengagement of BCR and CD40 had a synergistic effect in B cell proliferation similar to that observed in WT cells (Fig. 6, A and B). Therefore, the synergy between the two signals is able to overcome the xid-induced activation defect in splenic B cell proliferation. This suggests the possibility that distinct biological outcomes of the BCR-CD40 synergy have different requirements for Btk. We have previously shown that BCR and CD40 also synergize in IL-6 production. In contrast to the proliferation data (Fig. 6, A and B), the xid mutation abrogated the ability of BCR and CD40 to synergize in IL-6 secretion without affecting the response to CD40 in the absence of the BCR (Fig. 6C). As expected, synergy was observed in WT B cells. Thus, the differences between proliferation and IgM secretion data above are not attributable to differences between B cell lines versus freshly isolated B cells. The IL-6 results support the more intriguing possibility that requirements and roles of Btk differ for distinct functions in which BCR and CD40 can cooperate. Relationship between Btk and PKD in the BCR Enhancement of the CD40 Response—Our data demonstrated that both Btk and PKD play a critical role in the synergy. Btk has been shown to associate with PKD in vitro (23.Johannes F.J. Hausser A. Storz P. Truckenmuller L. Link G. Kawakami T. Pfizenmaier K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), but the biological consequences of this in vivo are not known. Although BCR engagement leads to activation of both Btk and PKD, it is unclear from the data whether Btk and PKD are interdependent in their effects on BCR-CD40 synergy. In contrast to the constitutively active PHD-PKD mutant (Fig. 1A), E41K-Btk (Fig. 5C) did not substitute for BCR engagement in the synergy with CD40, suggesting that the Btk effect on synergy is PKD-dependent. To test this possibility more directly, B cells were stimulated through CD40 and/or the BCR in the presence or absence of induced expression of Btk E41K with or without a PKD inhibitor. We have previously shown that treatment of cells with Gö6976 inhibits PKD activation and abrogates BCR-CD40 synergy (Ref. 11.Haxhinasto S.A. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4655-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar and Fig. 7). Interestingly, the enhancement of the CD40 response upon Btk E41K expression as well as the additional augmentation via BCR engagement was abrogated upon PKD inactivation via Gö6976 treatment of cells. It was unclear from these data whether PKD is immediately downstream of Btk and whether Btk activation is necessary for PKD activation. Thus, to test the requirement for Btk in PKD activation we examined BCR-induced PKD activation in cells from WT and xid mice. As shown in Fig. 7B, the xid mutation does not abrogate PKD activation in B cells, demonstrating that Btk is required for CD40-BCR synergy independent of its potential involvement in PKD activation. The inhibitor data support a model in which Btk activation contributes to BCR-CD40 synergy in a PKD-dependent manner. However, the role of Btk is not to directly activate PKD but rather to cooperate with PKD-mediated signals in enhancing BCR-CD40 interactions. Before the present study, we demonstrated that BCR-induced PKD activation was a necessary component of synergistic interactions between CD40 and the BCR. Interestingly, the previous findings showed that this role of PKD required the binding of TRAFs 2 and 3 to CD40. The present study addressed how molecules activated by BCR engagement might affect TRAF-dependent CD40 synergy. The activation of PKD could affect TRAF2 via direct modification or indirectly via interaction with other molecules. One possible modification by kinases is phosphorylation, and we did see enhanced phosphorylation of TRAF2 after BCR signaling. Our results did not support a role for PKD in direct phosphorylation of the most likely candidate residues (Ser-453 and -455) in TRAF2, however. In addition, PKD inhibition via Gö6976 treatment of cells, although lowering the overall phosphorylation status of the immunoprecipitated proteins, did not abrogate the BCR-induced phosphorylation of TRAF2 (data not shown). These data suggest that the contribution of PKD in the synergy, although ultimately affecting TRAF2, is mediated through modification of an additional molecule. Interestingly, our studies revealed a requirement for another conserved residue, Tyr-484, in CD40-BCR synergy. Although further work is needed to determine the exact role of Tyr-484, it could facilitate the recruitment of additional factors to CD40. Alternatively, its modification could induce the dissociation of a negative regulatory factor. The finding that Tyr-484 of TRAF2 is critical for synergy led us to investigate the potential involvement of the tyrosine kinase Btk in the cross-talk between the BCR and CD40, because PKD and Btk have been shown to associate in B cells (23.Johannes F.J. Hausser A. Storz P. Truckenmuller L. Link G. Kawakami T. Pfizenmaier K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and PKD activation is diminished in Btk-deficient cells (3.Sidorenko S.P. Law C.L. Klaus S.J. Chandran K.A. Takata M. Kurosaki T. Clark E.A. Immunity. 1996; 5: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Indeed, R28C-Btk, a dominant-negative Btk, abrogated the synergy between BCR and CD40, a phenotype similar to the expression of dominant-negative PKD (11.Haxhinasto S.A. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4655-4662Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Our data also showed that the role of Btk in the synergy was PKD-dependent. Inactivation of PKD via pharmacological inhibition abrogated the ability of E41K-Btk (constitutively active) to enhance the CD40 response seen in the absence of inhibitor. The role of Btk in synergy, thus, depends upon activation of PKD, and the data suggest Btk might be involved (directly or indirectly) in PKD activation. However, we did not detect any difference in PKD activation between B cells from WT and xid mice, supporting distinct but complementary roles for Btk and PKD in the synergy between BCR and CD40. Our studies with mouse splenic B cells from xid mice showed that Btk is involved in the synergy observed in IL-6 secretion. Interestingly, synergy in B cell proliferation was not affected in xid cells even though cells were unresponsive to BCR signals alone. These results suggest that proliferation and IL-6 secretion in B cells utilize distinct signaling components. Of particular interest was the finding that co-engagement of BCR and CD40 overcame the dependence of BCR signals on Btk in promoting B cell proliferation. A similar finding was recently reported by Mizuno and Rothstein (31.Mizuno T. Rothstein T.L. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar); however, those studies only looked at cells pretreated with anti-CD40. Our data demonstrate that simply co-engagement of BCR and CD40 is sufficient to overcome the BCR dependence on Btk activation in B cell proliferation, but not IL-6 secretion or IgM production. These data are consistent with our previous studies showing that CD40-induced IgM secretion is partially dependent on IL-6 production (32.Jalukar S.V. Hostager B.S. Bishop G.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The present findings support a novel role for the PKD-TRAF2 relationship in linking the BCR and CD40 signaling pathways and suggest a potential role for tyrosine phosphorylation in regulating TRAF2-mediated effects on CD40 signaling. Additionally, Btk activation is shown to be required for synergy, dependent upon PKD activation. Both BCR and CD40 localize to membrane rafts upon engagement (33.Cheng P.C. Dykstra M.L. Mitchell R.N. Pierce S.K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1549-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 34.Hostager B.S. Catlett I.M. Bishop G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15392-15398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We propose (Fig. 8) that upon co-engagement of BCR and CD40, the respective signaling complexes are brought into proximity, enabling interactions among them. This would allow molecules involved in BCR signaling, such as Btk and PKD, to interact with and modify the CD40 signaling complex, including TRAF molecules. In WT cells interference with Btk or PKD activation and/or TRAF2-binding to CD40 leads to abrogation of synergy. Therefore, the signaling molecules in B lymphocytes, kinases, or adaptor molecules regulate not only distinct signaling pathways but also play a critical role in bridging such pathways. This would allow diverse and discrete cellular responses depending on the combination of signals provided by the microenvironment. We thank Dr. David Rawlings for Btk constructs. Dr. Bruce Hostager provided helpful discussion, and Karen Larison provided excellent technical assistance."

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3111-3119Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that testosterone and testosterone covalently bound to bovine serum albumin activate only the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway in male osteoblasts via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein (12.Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7217-7223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PLC leads to the increased formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, which regulates the release of intracellular calcium from endoplasmic reticulum, and diacylglycerol (DAG), which regulates the activity of PKC. PLCβ isoforms are activated by the Gα subunits of Gq family proteins or by Gβγ dimers (22.Boyer J.L. Graber S.G. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2814-2819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Exton J.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 10-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In many cases, Gβγ dimers are required for the activation of effectors such as MAPK rather than the Gα subunits (24.Gutkind, J. S. (2000) Sci. STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/40/re1Google Scholar). The MAPK modules include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs), the p38 (α, γ, and δ) MAPKs, and big MAPK (ERK5), whose general compositions and primary sequences are very similar (25.Brunet A. Pouyssegur J. Essays Biochem. 1997; 32: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Naor Z. Benard O. Seger R. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 91-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 27.Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.-E. Karandikar M. Beram K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3547) Google Scholar). However, MAPK modules must be capable of discriminating between distinct stimuli to elicit the appropriate physiological response. While the events leading to MAPK activation take place in the cytoplasm, MAPK is the first member of the cascade to be translocated to the nucleus where it contacts and phosphorylates key nuclear substrates involved in proliferation/differentiation. Steroid signaling affects the proliferation and differentiation of major endocrine tissues, including bone, via the AR, which can be phosphorylated by protein kinases. Steroid signaling also induces rapid effects that are independent of the classical AR. We have examined the question of how all these aspects can be coordinated in a single experimental model using non-malignant cells that possess classical androgen and estrogen receptors. We have used male osteoblasts, the cells responsible for osteogenesis, from newborn rats and identified the G subunit, PLC isoform, and PKC isoenzyme involved in the rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2 by androgens. We have also investigated the effect of androgens on upstream proteins and downstream transcription factors involved in this pathway. Our studies were done using 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) rather than testosterone as osteoblasts possess an aromatase that can convert testosterone into estradiol. Materials—The ECL™ kit was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and Fura-2/AM and inhibitors of PKC were from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PLC, anti-G-protein, anti-conventional protein kinase C (cPKC) (α and βI), and anti-androgen receptor antibodies and their blocking peptides were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Tebu, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Bio-Rad. Rabbit polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK, anti-p44/42 MAPK, anti-phospho-p38 MAPK, anti-p38 MAPK, anti-phospho-SAPK/JNK, anti-SAPK/JNK, anti-phospho-Elk-1, anti-Elk-1, and anti-phospho-c-Raf-1 antibodies, control peptides, blocking peptides, and PD98059 were from New England BioLabs Inc. (Ozyme, Saint Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). Monoclonal anti-c-Raf-1 antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (Interchim, Montluçon, France). PP1 and LY294002 were from Biomol (Tebu). 5α-Dihydroxytestosterone and all other chemicals were from Sigma. Dulbecco's modified essential medium and fetal calf serum (FCS) were supplied by Invitrogen. ICI 182,170 was from Tocris (Fisher Bioblock Scientific). Culture materials were from Dominique Dutscher (Brumath, France). The DHT was dissolved in ethanol; the final concentration of ethanol in the culture medium or buffer never exceeded 0.01%. This ethanol concentration was without effect on any biological parameter tested in this study (data not shown). Osteoblast Isolation and Culture—Osteoblasts were isolated from parietal bones of 2-day-old male or female Wistar rats (Charles River/Iffa Credo, L'Arbresle, France) by sequential enzymatic digestion (28.Wong G. Cohn D.V. Nature. 1974; 252: 713-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to confluence on rectangular glass coverslips or in Petri dishes in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS. Cells were then incubated for 24 h in phenol red-free medium plus 1% heat-inactivated FCS and transferred to serum-free medium 24 h before use. Cell Labeling and Lipid Chromatography—DAG formation was assessed by incubating cells for 24 h with 0.25 μCi/ml [14C]arachidonic acid (Amersham Biosciences) in phenol red-free medium with 1% heat-inactivated FCS. The labeled cells were incubated for 2 h in fresh serum-free medium; ethanol (0.01%) or 100 pm DHT was added for 5–60 s. The reaction was stopped by removing the medium and adding cold methanol. The lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (29.Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 37: 911-917Crossref Scopus (42861) Google Scholar), and neutral lipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described previously (12.Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7217-7223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cyclic AMP Assay—Cells were seeded at 50,000 cells/well in 6-well plates and cultured until confluent in 10% heat-inactivated FCS medium. Cells were then incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium. The medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for 1–30 min in Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), and 10 pm–1 μm DHT, 1 μm forskolin, or ethanol. The cells were placed on ice, and the medium was removed. Cellular cAMP was extracted twice with ethanol. The ethanol extracts were dried and stored at –20 °C. Cyclic AMP was measured by radiocompetition as described by Lust et al. (30.Lust W.D. Dye E. Deaton A.V. Passoneau J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cell cAMP content is expressed as pmol/mg of protein. All measurements were made six times for each concentration and for each culture. Calcium Measurement and Experimental Protocol—The confluent osteoblasts grown on glass coverslips were washed with Hanks' HEPES, pH 7.4 (137 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 0.441 mm KH2PO4, 0.442 mm Na2HPO4, 0.885 mm MgSO4·7H2O, 27.7 mm glucose, 1.25 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm HEPES) and loaded with 1 μm Fura-2/AM for 20 min in the same buffer at room temperature. The glass coverslip was inserted into a custom-made holder in a quartz cuvette (12.Lieberherr M. Grosse B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7217-7223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that, in turn, was placed in a temperature-controlled (37 °C) Hitachi F-2500 spectrofluorometer (Sciencetec, Les Ulis, France). Drugs and reagents were added directly to the cuvette with continuous stirring. The Fura-2 fluorescence response to the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was calibrated as described previously (31.Le Mellay V. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Each measurement on Fura-2-loaded cells was followed by a parallel experiment under the same conditions on unloaded cells. We determined the subunit of G-proteins and PLC isoenzyme involved in the DHT effects on [Ca2+]i. Osteoblasts were incubated for 5 min with 20 μg/ml saponin plus excess anti-G-protein antibody or anti-PLC antibody as described previously (31.Le Mellay V. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32.Le Mellay V. Lasmolles F. Lieberherr M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The antibodies were used at concentrations of 0.1–10 μg/ml. Cells were washed four times with Hanks' HEPES to remove saponin and incubated with anti-G-protein or anti-PLC antibody or nonimmune rabbit serum for 1 h at 37 °C (31.Le Mellay V. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32.Le Mellay V. Lasmolles F. Lieberherr M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fura-2/AM was then added for 20 min. In some experiments, anti-G-protein antibody or anti-PLC antibody was set up in competition with the antigen against which it was produced or with the antigens for the other anti-G-protein or anti-PLC antibodies at room temperature prior to use. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-Diphosphate Hydrolysis Assay—Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and scraped off into ice-cold buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm pepstatin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.125 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were sonicated on ice (2 × 20 s) at 40 kHz, and the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g to remove nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged for 60 min at 100,000 × g, and the resulting membrane pellet was suspended in extraction buffer. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared according to Hofmann and Majerus (33.Hofmann S.L. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14359-14564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 2.5 ml of phosphatidylserine (1 m), 2.5 ml of phosphatidylethanolamine (1 m), 2.5 ml of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (0.1 m) dissolved in chloroform, and 1 μCi of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate ([3H]PIP2, Amersham Biosciences) were mixed in a glass tube and dried under nitrogen. HEPES buffer (0.5 ml, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl) was added, and the tube was mixed well for 5 min and then sonicated for 30 min in a sonication bath (Branson 2200, Branson Ultrasons, Rungis, France). The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g (at 4 °C). The resulting supernatant was used as the source of [3H]PIP2. The assays were done essentially as described by Wu et al. (34.Wu D. Lee C.H. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1811-1817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the membrane (10 μl, 10 μg of protein) were added to 40 μl of assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm EDTA) plus 10 μlof[3H]PIP2 (10,000–12,000 cpm) and incubated on ice for 10 min. For the antibody inhibition assay, membranes were incubated for 2 h with 10 μl of the antibody at the concentrations indicated prior to adding the reaction mixture. For competition assays with the antigen, 10 μl of the antibody was mixed with 2 μl of serially diluted antigen before adding the membrane and incubated for 2 h on ice. The reaction was started by adding GTPγS followed by incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of chloroform/methanol/HCl (40:20:0.5), mixing, and chilling on ice. Soluble inositol phosphates (indicating PIP2 hydrolysis) were extracted with 150 μl of chloroform and 200 μl of HCl. Phases were separated by centrifugation, and 200 μl of the upper aqueous phase was taken for liquid scintillation counting. Cell Fractionation and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were scraped off into ice-cold extraction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm pepstatin, 0.5 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.125 mm aprotinin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and sonicated on ice (2 × 20 s) at 40 kHz. An aliquot of the lysate was saved, and the remainder was centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g to remove nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was saved. The resulting membrane pellet was suspended in extraction buffer. All the fractions (lysate, cytosol, membrane, and nuclei) were frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and stored at –80 °C. Protein was assayed by the method of Bradford (35.Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216357) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by Tricine/SDS-PAGE for Gγ subunits (36.Schäegger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10479) Google Scholar) or SDS-PAGE (resolving gel: 12% for Gβ subunits, 8% for PKC, or 10% for MAPK, AR, c-Raf-1, and Elk-1) in 25 mm Tris base, pH 8.3, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% Tween 20 and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, St. Quentin-en-Yvelines, France) in the same buffer with 20% ethanol for 2 h at 100 V. The free sites of the membrane were blocked by immersing it for 1 min in 5 mg/ml polyvinyl alcohol and then in Tris-buffered saline containing 4% skim milk. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit polyclonal anti-Gβ, anti-Gγ, anti-PKC, anti-MAPK, anti-c-Raf-1, or anti-Elk1 antibodies. Unbound antibodies were removed by three washes in skim milk/Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20. The membranes were incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1: 1000 diluted) or peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1/1000 diluted), washed twice with Tris-buffered saline, 0.5% Tween 20, and washed once with Tris-buffered saline. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit. Membranes were exposed to XR films. Signals were digitized with a LAS-1000plus camera (Fujifilm, Raytest France, Courbevoie, France), and the intensities of the signals were quantified with the Aida program (Advanced Image Data Analyzer, Version 3.11, Raytest France). Statistical Analysis—The data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. Treatment pairs were compared by Dunnett's method. The value n represents n different cultures of male or female osteoblasts for a specific experiment. Direct Effects of DHT on Intracellular Calcium and Diacylglycerol Formation—The basal [Ca2+]i in confluent male osteoblasts was 112 ± 5 nm, mean ± S.E., n = 6. DHT (100 pm) triggered a transient increase in [Ca2+]i that fell rapidly after 15 s but remained above the basal level (plateau phase, 26 ± 4%, mean ± S.E., n (culture) = 4) (Fig. 1A). The dose dependence of the DHT effect on [Ca2+]i was bell-shaped between 1 pm and 10 nm (Fig. 1B). The PLC inhibitor U-73122 inhibited the transient peak when added 60 s before DHT but had no effect on the plateau phase (Fig. 1C). U-73343 (0.5–5 μm), an inactive analog of U-73122, had no effect (data not shown). The calcium channel inhibitor verapamil (1 μm) inhibited part of the transient peak when added 60 s before DHT; it also abolished the plateau phase (Fig. 1C). Incubating cells in medium containing 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) for 18 h inhibited the sharp peak Ca2+ response to DHT but had no effect on the plateau phase (Fig. 1D). Incubation with the androgen antagonist cyproterone acetate (1 μm) for 5 min–4 h did not block the calcium response to DHT (Fig. 1E). Flutamide could not be used because of its high fluorescent intensity, which disturbs the calcium measurement with Fura-2/AM. 17β-Estradiol and 5β-dihydroxytestosterone (10 pm–10 nm) had no effect on [Ca2+]i in male osteoblasts (data not shown). The pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780 (1 μm) had no effect on the calcium response to DHT when added for 5 min–4 h (Fig. 1F). Lastly DHT (100 pm) produced a rapid increase (within 5 s) in DAG formation (Fig. 1G) that was blocked by U-73122 and PTX (data not shown). Fig. 2 shows the calcium response to 100 pm DHT in female osteoblasts (Fig. 2A), and DHT (10 pm–10 nm) had no effect (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Effects of DHT on intracellular calcium in female osteoblasts. A, trace of the calcium response after adding 100 pm DHT. The results are representative of six coverslips for each culture (n = 3). B, DHT dose-response curve. The [Ca2+]i was measured at t = 10 s. The values are means ± S.E., n (culture) = 3. Eth, ethanol.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) G-proteins and PLC Isoenzymes Involved in the Effects of Androgens on Intracellular Calcium—We have shown that osteoblasts possess Gαs, Gαi, Gαq/11, Gβ1–4, and Gγ1 (31.Le Mellay V. Grosse B. Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11902-11907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32.Le Mellay V. Lasmolles F. Lieberherr M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 75: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore looked for Gβ and Gγ subunits in osteoblast lysates. Whole-cell lysates of male osteoblasts were also found to possess Gβ1, Gβ2, Gβ3, Gβ4, Gβ5, Gγ2, Gγ3, Gγ5, and Gγ7 (Western blots not shown). Incubating cells with saponin for 5 min followed by incubation for 60 min in medium without saponin but containing anti-G-protein antibody, anti-PLC antibody, or nonimmune serum did not affect the basal [Ca2+]i (data not shown). Incubation with 0.1–10 μg/ml anti-Gαi1–3, anti-Gαs, or Gαq/11 antibodies had no effect (data shown only for anti-Gαi1–3, Fig. 3). The DHT-induced transient [Ca2+]i peak was blocked by 2 μg/ml anti-Gβ4 antibody, but the plateau phase was not (Fig. 3). The inhibition was abolished when the antibody was incubated with its antigen for 2 h prior to use (Fig. 3). The blockade of the calcium response to DHT by the anti-Gβ4 antibody was not enhanced when various anti-Gγ antibodies were added to the incubation mixture (Table I). Incubation with anti-Gβ1, anti-Gβ2, anti-Gβ3, or anti-Gβ5 antibody or different anti-Gγ subunit antibodies (0.1–10 μg/ml) did not modify the calcium response to DHT (Fig. 3, data shown only for anti-Gβ2 antibody and anti-Gγ2 antibody). Similarly incubation with both anti-Gβ1, anti-Gβ2, anti-Gβ3, or anti-Gβ5 antibody and different anti-Gγ subunit antibodies (0.1–10 μg/ml) did not modify the calcium response to DHT. Table I shows the results of the various combinations of antibody to different G subunits. Incubating the cells with 1 μm cyproterone acetate for 4 h did not modify the calcium response to DHT in the presence of anti-Gβ4 antibody (Fig. 3). The DHT-induced sharp increase in [Ca2+]i was inhibited by 1 μg/ml anti-PLCβ2 antibody (–81 ± 3%, mean ± S.E., n = 6), whereas 0.1–10 μg/ml antibody to PLCβ1 or PLCβ3 had no effect (Fig. 4, data shown only for 1 μg/ml antibody). The residual increase was due to Ca2+ influx because it was blocked by incubating the cells for 30 s with 2 mm EGTA (Fig. 4). Anti-PLCγ1 and anti-PLCγ2 antibodies (0.1–10 μg/ml) had no effect (Fig. 3). Anti-PLCβ4 antibody had no effect because rat osteoblasts lack this PLCβ isoform (30.Lust W.D. Dye E. Deaton A.V. Passoneau J.V. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In some experiments, anti-PLCβ2 antibody was incubated for 2 h with its antigen or other PLC antigens (antibody:antigen, 1:10 or 1:100) before use. The inhibition due to anti-PLCβ2 antibody was lost only when the anti-PLCβ2 antibody was incubated with its own antigen (Fig. 4). In other experiments, the cells were incubated for 4 h with 1 μm cyproterone acetate before adding 100 pm DHT. The antagonist did not modify the calcium response to DHT in the presence of anti-PLCβ2 antibody (Fig. 4).Table IThe effects of DHT on intracellular calcium of male osteoblasts incubated with various combinations of antibodies to different G subunitsG subunitΔ[Ca2+]iγ1(5 μg/ml)γ2(5 μg/ml)γ3(5 μg/ml)γ5(5 μg/ml)γ7(5 μg/ml)nmβ4 (2 μg/ml)199 ± 8ap < 0.001 versus nonimmune serum plus DHT.185 ± 11ap < 0.001 versus nonimmune serum plus DHT.187 ± 13ap < 0.001 versus nonimmune serum plus DHT.179 ± 16ap < 0.001 versus nonimmune serum plus DHT.192 ± 10ap < 0.001 versus nonimmune serum plus DHT.β1 (5 μg/ml)309 ± 11321 ± 19296 ± 9289 ± 12300 ± 10β2 (5 μg/ml)283 ± 15291 ± 10303 ± 11279 ± 21275 ± 14β3 (5 μg/ml)306 ± 14307 ± 17295 ± 8304 ± 10298 ± 10β5 (5 μg/ml)305 ± 10299 ± 11300 ± 12301 ± 6298 ± 9a p < 0.001 versus nonimmune serum plus DHT.

https://openalex.org/W1987039511,"Metanephric kidney development requires an inductive interaction between the ureteric bud and progenitor mesenchyme, where the early expression of two genes, Wilms’ tumour 1 (WT1) and paired box 2 (Pax2), establishes critical but unknown developmental pathways. Indeed, transgenic mice with deregulated overexpression of Pax2 exhibit structural kidney defects and impaired renal function, as do mice harboring targeted disruptions and/or spontaneous mutations of either the Pax2 or WT1 genes. WT1 and Pax2 are thought to regulate each other's expression during renal development. To better define the relationship between WT1 and Pax2, we generated mouse embryos containing heterozygous mutations in both genes. WT1+/−/Pax21Neu/+ kidneys were 50% smaller than wild-type kidneys. They were characterized by severe attenuation of the renal medulla, and reduced development of calyces and the renal pelvis. Renal cortex development in compound heterozygotes culminated in fewer nephrons than in WT1+/−, Pax21Neu/+ or wild-type mice. Only minor variations in the mesenchymal expression pattern of Pax2 protein, and the mRNA expression levels of Pax2 and WT1, were noted in mutant kidneys. We show that WT1 and Pax2 proteins interact in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that WT1 and Pax2 can form a molecular complex. Our data suggest that WT1 is a modifier of the Pax2 mutant phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2002337871,"Neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) is a constitutively expressed enzyme responsible for the production of nitric oxide (NO•) from l-arginine and O2. Nitric oxide is an intra- and intercellular messenger that mediates a diversity of signaling pathways in target cells. In the absence of l-arginine, nNOS has been shown to generate superoxide (O2·¯). Superoxide, either directly or through its self-dismutation to H2O2, is likewise believed to be a cell-signaling agent. Because nNOS can generate NO• and O2·¯, we examined the activation of cellular signal transduction pathways in nNOS-transfected cells grown in the presence or absence of l-arginine. Spin trapping/EPR spectroscopy confirmed that stimulated nNOS-transfected cells grown in an l-arginine environment secreted NO• into the surrounding milieu. Production of NO• blocked Ca2+ ionophore-induced activation of the ERK1/2 through a mechanism involving inhibition of the Ras G-protein and Raf-1 kinase. In contrast, ERK activation was largely unaffected in nNOS-transfected cells grown in l-arginine-free media. Inhibition of nNOS-generated NO• with the competitive NOS inhibitor, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, in cells grown in l-arginine restored ERK1/2 activation to levels similar to that found when nNOS was activated in l-arginine-free media. These findings indicate that nNOS can differentially regulate the ERK signal transduction pathway in a manner dependent on the presence of l-arginine and the production of NO•.

Spin trapping/EPR spectroscopy confirmed that stimulated nNOS-transfected cells grown in an l-arginine environment secreted NO• into the surrounding milieu. Production of NO• blocked Ca2+ ionophore-induced activation of the ERK1/2 through a mechanism involving inhibition of the Ras G-protein and Raf-1 kinase. In contrast, ERK activation was largely unaffected in nNOS-transfected cells grown in l-arginine-free media. Inhibition of nNOS-generated NO• with the competitive NOS inhibitor, NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, in cells grown in l-arginine restored ERK1/2 activation to levels similar to that found when nNOS was activated in l-arginine-free media. These findings indicate that nNOS can differentially regulate the ERK signal transduction pathway in a manner dependent on the presence of l-arginine and the production of NO•.

These NOS isoforms contain an N-terminal oxidase domain with binding sites for l-arginine, tetrahydrobiopterin, and a C-terminal reductase domain with binding sites for FAD, FMN, and NADPH.

Previously, it has been reported that nNOS will produce superoxide (O2·¯) in the absence of l-arginine (8Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, eNOS and iNOS, like nNOS, have been found to generate O2·¯ (9Xia Y. Roman L.J. Masters B.S. Zweier J.L. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25804-25808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). In the presence of l-arginine, however, nNOS generates NO• and O2·¯; the ratio of these free radicals is dependent upon the concentration of l-arginine (12Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This makes NOS unique in that this enzyme can produce two free radicals, NO• and O2·¯, both of which exhibit unique biologic activities (14Jacobson M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 83-86Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, NO•, secreted from the different isozymes, mediates a wide variety of regulatory functions. In the case of iNOS, a high level of NO• production for prolonged periods is consistent with its role in host immunity (15Akaike T. Maeda H. Immunology. 2000; 101: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). In contrast, the production of NO• by eNOS and nNOS is at a much lower level, where NO• is believed to be a transient cell-signaling agent (16Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). For example, NO• is an activator of soluble guanylate cyclase and cGMP production, which is an important second messenger that mediates a wide variety of physiological functions (17Pfeilschifter J. Eberhardt W. Huwiler A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 429: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These include, for instance, the regulation of vascular tone, platelet aggregation, inflammation, neurotransmission, learning and memory, penile erection, gastric emptying, and hormone release (18Lane P. Gross S.S. Semin. Nephrol. 1999; 19: 215-229PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of O2·¯, where the enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD) accelerates the disproportionation of O2·¯ to H2O2 and O2 (19McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6056-6063Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cell signaling activity of O2·¯, were it to occur, is undoubtedly at unique cellular sites, distant from SOD (20Wolin M.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1430-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-signaling pathways are major mediators of extracellular signals. MAP kinases are serine/threonine kinases, which include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), p38 kinases, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) (21Lopez-Ilasaca M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 56: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase proteins are involved in many cellular functions such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, cell death, and inflammatory responses (22Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Davis R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 23Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of the MAP kinase pathway often occurs in response to growth factor stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, which are coupled to the activation of Ras G-proteins through Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, such as Shc and Grb2, and guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as SOS (23Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active GTP-bound form of Ras can activate kinases, such as Raf-1 and other MEK kinase-1 (MEKK1), which phosphorylate and activate MAP or ERK kinases (MEKs) required for MAP kinase activation (24Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase family members regulate this diverse range of biological functions by phosphorylating transcription factors, other kinases, structural proteins, and other signaling proteins (23Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Cobb M.H. Hepler J.E. Cheng M. Robbins D. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1994; 5: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). Studies to date have investigated the cell-signaling pathways for NO• and O2·¯ by exposing cells to exogenous sources of these free radicals (26Levonen A.L. Patel R.P. Brookes P. Go Y.M. Jo H. Parthasarathy S. Anderson P.G. Darley-Usmar V.M. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2001; 3: 215-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Although useful data have come from these experiments, little is known about how NOS-secreted NO• and O2·¯ mediate cell-signaling pathways. We envision that by altering the free radical profile of nNOS, from a primary generator of NO• to a primary producer of O2·¯ (8Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yoneyama H. Yamamoto A. Kosaka H. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 247-253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we could begin to address the seminal question: how are cell-signaling pathways regulated by nNOS generated NO• and/or O2·¯? Here we report on experiments that examine the nNOS regulation of MAP kinases, specifically ERK1/2, under conditions where nNOS is stimulated in the presence or absence of l-arginine in the cell media. We show that the selective production of NO• by nNOS inhibits ERK activation by blocking Ras G-protein and Raf-1 kinase function. In contrast, stimulation of nNOS in the absence of l-arginine-free cell media, which is likely to generate O2·¯, had little effect on Ca2+ ionophore-induced ERK activity. These findings demonstrate that nNOS has the capability to regulate differentially the ERK signal transduction pathway, depending on the presence or absence of l-arginine and the subsequent production of NO• and/or O2·¯. Reagents—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, LipofectAMINE, penicillin G/streptomycin solution, Geneticin®, and Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were purchased from Invitrogen.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48494-48501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of plasmids expressing constitutively active versions of MKK1 (a gift from Dr. Natalie Ahn, University of Colorado), Raf-1 (BXB-Raf-1, a gift from Dr. Ulf Rapp, University of Wurzburg, Germany), and H-Ras (V12) (a gift from Dr. Melanie Cobb, University of Texas, Southwestern). Cell Culture—Human embryonic nNOS-transfected kidney 293 cells (abbreviated 293 cells) were obtained from Dr. Yong Xia at The Johns Hopkins University. These cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics penicillin G (50 μg/ml) and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air-humidified incubator. Cells were selected by DMEM containing 500 μg/ml Geneticin® at every five passages. Non-transfected 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). To deplete intracellular stores of l-arginine from nNOS-transfected and non-transfected cells, cells were cultured in DMEM for 2 days until 70–80% confluent and then the medium was replaced with medium containing all other amino acids except l-arginine for 24 h as described previously (30Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). At the time of the experimentation, cells were then treated with Ca2+ ionophore for 15 min to 6 h. Cultured cells were washed three times with cold PBS, containing 0.9 mm CaCl2 and 5.5 mm glucose. Cells were then harvested in tissue lysis buffer (TLB, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) using a rubber scraper. Cells were lysed and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm to remove insoluble material. Isolation of nNOS from 293 Cells—Neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, from nNOS-transfected 293 cells, was isolated following the method described in the literature (31Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3125) Google Scholar) with some modification as reported previously (8Pou S. Pou W.S. Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24173-24176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar). Spin Trapping of NO• from Isolated nNOS and nNOS-transfected Human Kidney Cells by an Iron Chelate—The iron chelate, ferro-N-methyl-d-glucamide dithiocarbamate (33Porasuphatana S. Weaver J. Budzichowski T.A. Tsai P. Rosen G.M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was used as the spin trap for NO•. This chelate was freshly prepared by mixing a stock solution of ferrous sulfate and NaMGD in a molar ratio of 1:5 in distilled water, anaerobically, prior to each experiment (33Porasuphatana S. Weaver J. Budzichowski T.A. Tsai P. Rosen G.M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Spin trapping of NO• from isolated nNOS was performed by mixing all the components described in the legends for Figs. 2 and 3 to a final volume of 0.30 ml. The solution was then placed in an EPR quartz flat cell and inserted into the cavity of an EPR spectrometer (model E109, Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA). The EPR spectrum shown in Fig. 2D was obtained at room temperature, 10 min after commencing the reaction. Instrument settings were as follows: microwave power, 20 mW; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; sweep time 12.5 G/min; and response time, 1 s. The receiver gain is given in the legend of Fig. 2.Fig. 3EPR spectrum of NO• generation in the presence of l-arginine in cultured cells. EPR spectrum ferro-N-methyl-d-glucamine dithiocarbamate.

Cells cultured in the presence or absence of l-arginine were treated with 1 μm Ca2+ ionophore (A23187) to activate nNOS. The receiver gain was 10.0 × 103.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nitric oxide was spin-trapped from nNOS-transfected cells. In this case, Fe(MGD)2 (1 mm, final concentration, prepared as described above) was added to the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, activated cells (20 × 106 cells) (Fig. 3). In an independent series of studies, arginase (15 units/ml) was added to the culture media 24 h prior to experimentation to metabolize l-arginine as described in the literature previously (34Culcasi M. Lafon-Cazal M. Pietri S. Bockaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12589-12593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This reaction mixture, 0.3 ml, was then transferred to an EPR quartz flat cell and placed into the cavity of an EPR spectrometer. EPR spectra were recorded continuously after the addition of the Ca2+ ionophore and at room temperature. Instrument settings were as follows: microwave power, 20 mW; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation amplitude, 1.0 G; sweep time, 12.5 G/min; and response time, 1 s. The receiver gain is given in the legend of Fig. 3. Spin Trapping of O2·¯ from Isolated nNOS—Spin trapping of O2·¯ from isolated nNOS was conducted by mixing all the components described in the figure legend to a final volume of 0.30 ml (Fig. 2). The experiment was initiated by the addition of purified nNOS. Reaction mixtures were then transferred to a flat quartz cell, fitted into the cavity of the EPR spectrometer. EPR spectra were recorded at room temperature. Microwave power was 20 mW; modulation frequency was 100 kHz; modulation amplitude was 1 G; sweep time was 25 G/min; response time was 1 s, and the receiver gain is presented in the legend of Fig. 2. Nitrite Assay—Accumulation of nitrite was determined colorimetrically after mixing 0.5 ml each of culture media and freshly prepared Griess reagent (0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine in water and 1% sulfanilamide in 5% phosphoric acid, mixed 1:1) (35Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10824) Google Scholar). Concentrations of nitrite were estimated by comparing absorbance at 550 nm against standard solutions of sodium nitrite prepared in the same media. Immunoblot Analysis—Cell protein lysates were diluted with an equal volume 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and heated to 100 °C for 2 min. Total protein (20 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The immobilized proteins were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS-Tween) (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and 5% nonfat dry milk. Following an overnight incubation at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies, ppERK (catalog number M8159 Sigma), ERK2 (C-14), pJNK (G-7), or PARP (H-250) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA), the membranes were washed several times with TBS-Tween. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was diluted 1:10,000 in TBS-Tween and incubated with the membrane for 45 min at room temperature. Following washes with TBS-Tween, proteins were detected using ECL purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. PEG-SOD Enhancement of Measured NO•—PEG-SOD (30 units/ml) was added to nNOS-293 cells in the presence of l-arginine 24 h before experimentation. Ca2+ ionophore was added to cells for 1 h, and 500 μl of media was used to perform the Griess reaction. Free Radical Detection in NOS-expressing 293 Cells—The objective of these studies was to investigate the response of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase-signaling pathway to stimulated nNOS expressed in 293 cells grown in the presence or absence of l-arginine. Before such studies can be undertaken, however, we verified the production of NO• and O2·¯ by using nNOS, isolated from nNOS-expressing 293 cells. In the absence of l-arginine, O2 accepts an electron from nNOS, resulting in the generation of O2·¯, which was identified by its reaction with DEPMPO, affording DEPMPO-OOH (Figs. 1 and 2A). When l-arginine is present, however, there is a binding of the guanidino nitrogen in an ordered position near the heme (36Tierney D.L. Huang H. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Silverman R.B. Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3704-3710Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), which allows the oxidation of this amino acid to proceed to l-citrulline and NO•. We have demonstrated previously that as the concentration of l-arginine increases, the amount of spin-trapped O2·¯ diminishes (12Pou S. Keaton L. Surichamorn W. Rosen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9573-9580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). This finding is illustrated in Fig. 2, A and B, where in the presence of l-arginine (100 μm) nNOS-generated O2·¯ was markedly decreased (Fig. 2B). As a control, when CaCl2 and calmodulin were not included in the reaction mixture, O2·¯ was not generated from the inactive nNOS, as no EPR spectrum corresponding to DEPMPO-OOH was observed (Figs. 1 and 2C). When l-arginine (100 μm) was added to a competent nNOS in the presence of Fe(MGD)2 (1 mm), a three-line EPR spectrum corresponding to NO-Fe(MGD)2 was observed (Figs. 1 and 2D); the EPR spectrum of which is typical of NO-Fe(chelates) (37Kon H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When nNOS-transfected 293 cells (20 × 106 cells), cultured in media containing l-arginine, were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 to activate nNOS in the presence of Fe(MGD)2, as described previously (38Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), the three-line EPR spectrum of NO-Fe(MGD)2 was recorded (Fig. 3A). In the absence of A23187, NO• was not spin-trapped (data not shown). Similarly, with non-transfected 293 cells that have been treated with A23187, NO• was again not spin-trapped (data not shown). These data demonstrate that the activation of nNOS in these nNOS-transfected 293 cells by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was responsible for the generation of NO•, which was detected extracellularly (33Porasuphatana S. Weaver J. Budzichowski T.A. Tsai P. Rosen G.M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Next, nNOS-transfected 293 cells were cultured in an l-arginine-free media for 24 h to diminish the intracellular pool of this amino acid, as described in the literature (38Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). As expected, NO• was not spin-trapped upon activation of these cells with A23187 (Fig. 3B). In addition, we were unable to spin trap NO• in cells that were cultured in normal media to which arginase (15 units/ml) was added 24 h prior to experimentation (34Culcasi M. Lafon-Cazal M. Pietri S. Bockaert J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12589-12593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). The Fe(chelate) used in the experiments described above to spin trap NO• is ionic. Although it may bind to the surface of these cells, due to the alcohol groups on the NaMGD (Fig. 1), there is no evidence that this iron-chelate diffuses into cells (33Porasuphatana S. Weaver J. Budzichowski T.A. Tsai P. Rosen G.M. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because NO• is produced intracellularly by stimulated nNOS-transfected 293 cells, a portion of the generated NO• must have diffused into the surrounding milieu where it was spin-trapped by Fe(MGD)2. The ability to spin trap NO• at a site distal from its evolution is not unexpected. The neutrality of this free radical and its slow reaction with O2 in buffers allow NO• to readily diffuse through membranes to targets (39Liu X. Samouilov A. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26194-26199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), in this case, the spin trap Fe(MGD)2. It has been reported that upon treatment of nNOS-transfected 293 cells cultured in l-arginine-free media for 24 h with A23187, O2·¯ was spin-trapped extracellularly by 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (38Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). In our hands, however, when we treated nNOS-transfected 293 cells cultured in l-arginine-free media for 24 h with A23187, we were unable to spin trap O2·¯ with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide or with even more robust spin traps, DEPMPO and 5-tert-butoxycarboxyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide. These findings are not surprising considering this is one of the few reports (38Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) of O2·¯ spin trapping in an extracellular milieu from an intracellular site where an enzyme generated this free radical. Nevertheless, based on the isolated nNOS experiments described, we believe that activation of nNOS-expressing 293 cells will, depending on the availability of l-arginine, generate NO• and/or O2·¯. NO• Inhibits ERK Activation—The activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase signal pathway was investigated in nNOS-expressing 293 cells. Previous reports (40Hua L.L. Zhao M.L. Cosenza M. Kim M.O. Huang H.

Neuroimmunol. 2002; 126: 180-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) suggest that free radicals have the ability to regulate biological responses through activation of MAP kinase-signaling pathways. ERK1/2 activation was measured by immunoblotting for the active dually phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2. A23187 stimulated ERK1/2 activation in controls as described in the literature (41Enslen H. Tokumitsu H. Stork P.J. Davis R.J. Soderling T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10803-10808Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). In contrast, A23187 treatment of nNOS-expressing 293 cells grown in the presence of l-arginine resulted in no ERK activation (Fig. 4A). However, when these cells were cultured in the absence of l-arginine in the media, followed by A23187 stimulation of nNOS, a slight decrease in ERK1/2 activation was shown (Fig. 4B). These data suggest that nNOS generation of NO• yields an inhibitory affect on Ca2+ ionophore-induced ERK1/2 activity. Previously, it has been shown that NO• donors or bacterial toxins can activate MAP kinases, JNK and p38 (42Peng T. Lu X. Lei M. Feng Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 8099-8105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Andreka P. Zang J. Dougherty C. Slepak T.I. Webster K.A. Bishopric N.H. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of free radical formation on the JNK MAP kinase pathway were examined. Ca2+ ionophore stimulation of nNOS in cells grown with or without l-arginine had no apparent effect on JNK activity (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Free radical production has no effect on JNK activation by Ca+2 ionophore. Non-transfected control (A) and nNOS-expressing 293 cells (B) grown in the presence or absence of l-arginine (L-ARG) for 24 h were stimulated with or without A23187 (CaI) for 15–180 min. Cell lysates were collected and immunoblotted for active phosphorylated JNK (pJNK) and total ERK2 for a protein loading control. Data are representative of four independent experiments.

However, little is known about the characteristics of API2, MALT1, and API2-MALT1 proteins. We therefore investigated the subcellular localization and stability of these products. API2 was localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and MALT1 and API2-MALT1 in the cytoplasm only. Western blot analysis showed that the products of API2 and MALT1 were unstable, while the API2-MALT1 product was stable. The API2 deletion mutants at the end of the C-terminal and the MALT1 deletion mutants at the end of the N-terminal were stable compared with the full-length products. These results indicate that the domains responsible for protein instability are located in the end of the C-terminal of API2 and in that of the N-terminal of MALT1, and also that API2-MALT1 became stable because it lacks these domains. It has been suggested that NF-kappaB activation plays an important role in the tumorigenesis of MALT lymphoma. Our findings further suggest that the stabilized expression of API2-MALT1 products may continuously stimulate the NF-kappaB activating pathway, thus leading to MALT lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966110750,"Calcium channel β subunits are essential regulatory elements of the gating properties of high voltage-activated calcium channels. Co-expression with β3 subunits typically accelerates inactivation, whereas co-expression with β4 subunits results in a slowly inactivating phenotype. Here, we have examined the molecular basis of the differential effect of these two subunits on the inactivation characteristics of Cav2.2 + α2-δ1 N-type calcium channels by creating a series of 22 chimeric β subunits that are based on various combinations of variable and conserved regions of the parent β subunit isoforms. Our data show that replacement of the N terminus region of β4 with a corresponding 14-amino acid stretch of β3 sequence accelerates the inactivation kinetics to levels seen with wild type β3. A similar kinetic speeding is observed by a concomitant substitution of the second conserved and variable regions, but not when these regions are substituted individually, suggesting that 1) the second variable and conserved regions cooperatively regulate N-type calcium channel inactivation and 2) that there are two redundant mechanisms that allow the β3 subunit to accelerate N-type channel inactivation. In contrast with previous reports in Cav2.1 calcium channels, deletion of the C-terminal region of Cav2.2 did not alter the regulation of the channel by wild type and chimeric β subunits.

Hence, the molecular underpinnings of β subunit regulation of voltage-gated calcium channels appear to vary with calcium channel subtype. The influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated calcium channels triggers a range of intracellular responses, ranging from gene transcription (1Dolmetsch R.E. Pajvani U. Fife K. Spotts J.M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 2001; 294: 333-339Google Scholar) and activation of second messenger pathways (2Lilienbaum A. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2680-2698Google Scholar, 3Borodinsky L.N. O'Leary D. Neale J.H. Vicini S. Coso O.A. Fiszman M.L. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 411-420Google Scholar) to the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic nerve termini (4Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. Science. 1994; 264: 107-111Google Scholar). The amount of calcium entry is regulated by a number of factors, including the intrinsic ability of calcium channels to inactivate in response to prolonged membrane depolarization. It has been suggested that the inactivation process involves the occlusion of the inner mouth of the pore by the intracellular domain I-II linker region of the channel (5Stotz S.C. Hamid J. Spaetgens R.L. Jarvis S.E. Zamponi G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24575-24582Google Scholar, 6Stotz S.C. Jarvis S E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar, 7Stotz S.C. Zamponi G.W.

This region physically interacts with ancillary calcium channel β subunits (9Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Google Scholar), which are key regulators of calcium channel inactivation. To date, four different types of calcium channel β subunits have been identified and shown to mediate a spectrum of modulatory actions on the function of high voltage-activated calcium channels. The β2a subunit uniquely slows the inactivation kinetics of the α1 subunit through palmitoylation and membrane anchoring of its N terminus region (10Olcese R. Qin N. Schneider T. Neely A. Wei X. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1433-1438Google Scholar, 11Qin N. Olcese R. Zhou J. Cabello O.A. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1539-C1545Google Scholar, 12Qin N.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 9046-9052Google Scholar), thus possibly restricting the mobility of the putative inactivation gate (for review, see Ref. 6Stotz S.C. Jarvis S E. Zamponi G.W. J. Physiol. 2004; (in press)Google Scholar). Despite the absence of palmitoylation sites, the remaining β subunit isoforms mediate differential effects on calcium channel inactivation. For example, channels co-expressed with β3 subunits typically undergo rapid inactivation, whereas channel complexes containing β4 tend to inactivate more slowly (12Qin N. Platano D. Olcese R. Costantin J.L. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4690-4695Google Scholar, 15Stea A. Tomlinson W.J. Soong T.W. Bourinet E Dubel S.J. Vincent S.R. Snutch T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10576-10580Google Scholar). This suggests that regions other than the N terminus are important regulatory elements of β subunit function. Indeed, the C-terminal region of the β4 subunit has been implicated in the regulation of P/Q-type calcium channel inactivation (16Walker D. Bichet D. Campbell K.P. De Waard M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2361-2367Google Scholar). However, to date there has been no systematic approach toward delineating the β subunit structural determinants that are responsible for the differential effects mediated by β3 and β4. The four calcium channel β subunits share a similar structural arrangement with two highly conserved regions (with 75 and 85% overall sequence identity, respectively) separated and flanked by a total of three variable regions of lower homology (35-55%; Ref. 17Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Google Scholar). Here, we report the creation and functional analysis of a series of chimeric β subunits in which variable and conserved domains were exchanged between wild type β3 and β4 subunits and co-expressed with rat Cav2.2 (N-type) calcium channels. Our data show that the transfer of any single domain was not sufficient to conclusively confer inactivation properties from β3 onto β4. Instead, multiple β3 subunit domains appear to be essential to facilitate the acceleration of N-type channel inactivation, with the V1 and C2 regions constituting critical structural determinants. We propose a model in which the intramolecular interactions among variable and conserved domains control the overall functional effect of β subunits on N-type channel gating. β3/4Chimeras—Unique restriction sites were introduced via the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) into the rat β3 (GenBank™ accession number M88751) and β4 (GenBank™ accession number L02315) cDNAs (both in the pMT2 expression vector) at exactly corresponding positions. The positions were chosen to align with the interfaces between previously identified regions of conservation and variability (Fig. 1 and Ref. 17Walker D. De Waard M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 148-154Google Scholar). Specifically, we introduced NruI sites at the end of the first variable region, SpeI sites at the end of the first conserved region, BsiWI sites at the end of the second variable region, and AscI sites at the end of the second conserved region (Fig. 1A). The sense strand sequences of the primers designed for this site-directed mutagenesis series are listed in Table I. The presence of the unique restriction sites was confirmed via digestions, and the mutant subunits were completely sequenced to confirm that no spontaneous mutations had been incorporated into the sequence. The original wild type β subunit clones supplied kindly by Dr. Snutch had included extensive 5′-and 3′-untranslated regions. The 5′-untranslated regions were removed through PCR amplification of the first three β subunit segments. The upstream sense PCR primers incorporated a novel 5′ KpnI site and an initial Kozak start sequence (18Kozak M. Nucleic Acid Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar) to promote expression in a mammalian system. The downstream antisense primers restricted the amplification region to just beyond the newly introduced BsiWI sites. PCR was also used to remove the 3′-untranslated regions through amplification of the last β subunit segment. The upstream sense PCR primers initiated amplification just before the AscI site. The downstream antisense primers restricted the amplification region and introduced a novel 3′ NotI restriction site immediately following the stop codon. All of these primer sequences are listed in Table II. The newly generated β3 and β4 PCR fragments were subcloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). The subcloned constructs were subjected to diagnostic restriction analysis, and the final candidates were sequenced to determine that no spontaneous mutations had been incorporated during PCR. T-easy constructs containing the 5′ region of β3 and β4 were cut with KpnI and BsiWI, and the insert was gel-isolated. The pMT2/β3 and pMT2/β4 constructs were similarly cut, and the fragments isolated from T-Easy were ligated. This resulted in four new cDNA constructs: β3 and β4 without the extensive 5′-untranslated region but containing novel 5′ KpnI sites and Kozak start sequences, as well as chimeric β33344 and β44433 constructs. These cDNAs and the T-easy β3 and β4 3′region-containing constructs were then cut with AscI and NotI and a second series of cDNA constructs (β3, β4, β33344, and β44433, all without the extensive 3′-untranslated region, as well as β33343, β44434, β44443, and β33334) was created through ligation. Restriction diagnostics were carried out to identify appropriately ligated cDNA, and in each case the entire insert was sequenced.Table ISense primers sequences used to generate unique and silent restriction sites in the β3 and β4 sequencesPrimer namePrimer sequence 5′ to 3′β3 NruIGCCGACTCCTACACCTCGCGACCCTCTCTGGβ3 SpeIGGATCGGGAGACTAGTGAAAGAAGGTGGβ3 BsiWICATGTCCCCCCGTACGATGTGGTGCCβ3 AscICTGGCGCGCCACCCACCACCβ4 NruIGGGTCAGCAGATTCCTATACATCGCGACCATCGGACTCCGβ4 SpeIGGTGGATAGGAAGACTAGTGAAGGAGGGCTGβ4 BsiWIGCACATTCCTCCGTACGATGTTGTGCCβ4 AscIGGAGGCATATTGGCGCGCCACCCACACAAGC Open table in a new tab Table IIPCR primers used to alter the 5′ and 3′-UTR of the β3 and β4 sequencesPrimer namePrimer sequence 5′ to 3′β3 KpnI senseGGTACCGCCGCCATGTATGACGACTCCTACGβ3 BsiWI antisenseCTACGTACGGGGGGACATGTTCCGCCTGCβ3 AscI senseGGTTTACTGGCGCGCCACCCACCACCCAGCβ3 NotI antisenseGCGGCCGCTCAGTAGCTGTCCTTAGGCCAAGGβ4 KpnI senseGGTACCGCCGCCATGTCGTCCTCCTACGCCβ4 BsiWI antisenseCGTACGGAGGAATGTGCTCCGTCACTTTCTGCβ4 AscI senseGCATATTGGCGCGCCACCCACACAAGCAGTAGCβ4 NotI antisenseGCGGCCGCTCAAAGCCTATGTCGGGAGTCATGG Open table in a new tab β3, β4, β33344, β44433, β33343, β44434, β44443, and β33334 were further cut with KpnI and SpeI to create more chimeras. The resulting DNA fragments were used for the next set of ligations, which produced β33444, β44333, β44344, β33433, β44343, β33434, β33443, and β44334. β3 and β4 were both cut with NruI and SpeI, and the DNA fragments were swapped to exchange the first conserved region and generate the β34333 and β43444 chimeras. A similar exchange of KpnI-SpeI fragments produced the β34444, β43333, β34433, β43344, β34434, and β43343 chimeras. In all 22 chimeras were produced, analyzed through restriction digests, and sequenced. Transient Expression—A human embryonic kidney tsA-201 cell line was used to express wild type and chimerical calcium channel complexes. The cells were grown in standard Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.5 mg/ml penicillin streptomycin. When the cells had grown to 90% confluency, they were split with trypsin-EDTA and plated on glass coverslips at a density of 10%. These cells were then transfected ∼12 h later. Fresh medium was given to the cells just prior to transfection, which was performed according to the standard calcium phosphate protocol (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cells were transiently transfected with a combination of cDNA constructs encoding for the calcium channel α1B, β, and α2-δ1 subunits (7 μg each) and 4 μg of enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP; Clontech). After 12 h of incubation at 37 °C in the presence of the calcium phosphate/cDNA mixture, the cells were washed with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and allowed to recover for an additional 12 h. The cells were then moved to a 28 °C, 5% CO2 incubator to prevent the cells from dividing further. Electrophysiological recordings, or protein biochemistry, were carried out 3 days later. Immunoprecipitations—Human embryonic kidney cells co-transfected with N-type calcium channels, plus the appropriate ancillary subunits were homogenized in 1 ml of RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and a mixture of protease inhibitors). The solution was incubated on ice for 1 h and centrifuged for 15 min (4 °C) at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected for overnight dialysis against the binding solution (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Total protein concentration was determined with the modified Lowry assay, and 100 μg of the transfected human embryonic kidney cell lysate was mixed with the Cav2.2 antibody (1:500 dilution; Calbiochem). The mixture was incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. 100 μl of precleared protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the polyclonal antibody mixture, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The solution was washed two times with Buffer B (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA), one time with Buffer C (0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA), and one time with Buffer D (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5). The complex was centrifuged and resuspended in 25 μl of 3 m urea, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, plus an additional 25 ml of 2× sample buffer was added to each sample, boiled 5 min, and loaded onto a 10% acrylamide SDS-PAGE minigel. The samples were separated and transferred to nylon membranes, and Western analysis was performed using the β4 antibody (diluted 1:250, Exalpha Biologicals Inc.) and detected using ECL detection methods. Electrophysiology—Wild type, chimeric, and mutant calcium channel complexes were screened at room temperature for macroscopic currents using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) linked to a personal computer equipped with either pCLAMP version 6.0 or 9.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF150-86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller to a typical resistance between 2 and 4 mΩ and fire-polished with a Narashige Microforge. For cells with currents greater than 1 nA or a series resistance greater than 12 mΩ, cell capacitance was measured, and series resistance was compensated to minimize contamination of records by voltage errors. The internal pipette solution consisted of 108 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 4 mm MgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, and 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH). The external bath solution consisted of 20 mm BaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, and 65 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). For experiments examining calcium-dependent inactivation (Fig. 2, F and G), the internal solution was 118 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES, 4 mm MgATP (pH 7.4 with CsOH). Solutions were exchanged via a home built gravity-driven microperfusion system. Current-voltage (I-V) relations were obtained by stepping the membrane potential from a holding potential of -100 mV to various test potentials. Steady state inactivation curves were obtained by holding cells at various conditioning potentials for 4 s prior to a test depolarization to +20 mV. Data Analysis and Statistics—The raw data were analyzed using Clampfit software (version 9.0) and Sigmaplot 2000 (Jandel Scientific). The time constant of activation was estimated by monoexponential fits to the late rising phase to peak, which adequately described the data in all cases. The time course of inactivation was fitted monoexponentially. Current voltage relations were fitted with the following equation,Ipeak=(V-Erev)×G×(1/(1+exp(Va-V)/S))(Eq. 2) where Erev is the reversal potential, Va is the half-activation potential, G is the maximum slope conductance, and S is the slope factor. Steady state inactivation curves were fitted with a modified Boltzmann relation,Ipeak(normalized)=C+(1-C)/(1+exp((V-Vh)*z/25.6))(Eq. 3) where V is the conditioning potential, Vh is the half-inactivation potential, z is the apparent valence/gating charge, and C represents any putative noninactivating fraction of current. For the wild type and chimeric channel complexes, with the exception of those containing β44434, a 4-s conditioning prepulse was sufficient to completely inactivate the channels at depolarized potentials. Channel complexes containing β44434 typically exhibited a 10% noninactivating current component. All of the figures were generated in Sigmaplot and modified in Powerpoint. The numbers in parentheses reflect individual experiments, which typically were obtained in multiple transfections, and the error bars reflect standard errors. Student's t tests were used initially to determine statistical significance (p < 0.05) between Cav2.2 channels co-expressed with β3 and β4 with regards to half-activation potential, half-inactivation potential, and kinetics of activation and inactivation. For comparisons of the effects of chimeric β subunits on Cav2.2 inactivation kinetics, ANOVAs 1The abbreviation used is: ! ANOVAanalysis of variance. or Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks were conducted, followed by post-hoc tests, either Student-Newman-Keul's method or Dunn's method, to determine statistical significance (p < 0.05). analysis of variance. β3and β4Mediate Distinct Effects on Cav2.2 Gating—Fig. 2 highlights the differential effects of the co-expression of β3 and β4 on the biophysical properties of Cav2.2 + α2 - δ1 channels. In response to membrane depolarization, the Cav2.2 β3 channel complex quickly activates, followed by rapid inactivation. (Fig. 2A, left panel). In contrast, the Cav2.2 β4 channels display slower activation and inactivation kinetics (Fig. 2A, right panel), resulting in a much smaller fraction of inactivated channels at the end of the test pulse (% inactivation at 125 ms = 48.5 ± 4.0, n = 16 for Cav2.2 + β4 and 83.4 ± 2.8, n = 11 for Cav2.2 + β3). Inactivation time constants observed in the absence of any β subunit were similar to those seen with β4 (not shown), indicating that β4 subunits do not significantly modulate Cav2.2 channel inactivation. Fig. 2 (B-G) quantitatively examines the distinct effects of the two β subunits on activation and inactivation gating. As seen in the figure, the activation time constants (Fig. 2B) and inactivation time constants (Fig. 2D) differ significantly at a range of different test potentials (Student's t test, p < 0.05). The half-inactivation potential was ∼5 mV more depolarized for channels containing the β4 subunit (Fig. 2E), whereas the half-activation potential was not significantly different (Fig. 2C). Although statistically significant (p < 0.05), the difference in half-inactivation potential was insufficiently large to allow for an investigation into the underlying β subunit structural determinants. However, as seen in Fig. 2D, the time constants of inactivation differ by ∼500%, thus providing a suitable base line for a chimeric approach. It was recently reported by Liang et al. (20Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Google Scholar) that Cav2.2 calcium channels co-expressed with β2a undergo significant calcium-dependent inactivation that can be unmasked when intracellular calcium buffering is reduced. To determine to what extent calcium ions affect the difference in inactivation kinetics observed upon co-expression of β3 and β4 (Fig. 2D), we examined the effects of switching from 20 mm external barium to 20 mm external calcium. In this set of experiments, the EGTA concentration in the intracellular recording solution was dropped to 0.5 mm, and ATP was added such that our internal solution matched that of Liang et al. (20Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Google Scholar). Fig. 2 (F and G, respectively) shows the inactivation time constants obtained in barium and calcium containing recording solution for Cav2.2 channels co-expressed with β3 (Fig. 2F, n = 6) or the β4 (Fig. 2G, n = 6) subunit. In each case, the time constants in barium and calcium were determined from the same cell. In the low EGTA solution, inactivation kinetics obtained in barium were slightly faster than those observed in high EGTA, but this was statistically significant only at 0 mV for β3, and at +30 mV for β4. Surprisingly, however, calcium did not significantly affect inactivation time constants at any test potential (paired t test between barium and calcium conditions). Moreover, the percentage of inactivation 300 ms into the test pulse was not different in barium and calcium (not shown). In light of the work of Liang et al. (20Liang H. DeMaria C.D. Erickson M.G. Mori M.X. Alseikhan B.A. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2003; 39: 951-960Google Scholar), these data suggest the intriguing possibility that calcium-dependent inactivation of N-type calcium channels may be dependent on the type of calcium channel β subunit. Moreover, our data suggest that inactivation of N-type channels complexes containing β3 and β4 is governed predominantly by a voltage-dependent process. Hence, for the remainder of the manuscript, we shall focus on voltage-dependent inactivation, using 20 mm barium as the external charge carrier and internal solution with 10 mm EGTA. Multiple β Subunit Structural Determinants Contribute to the Regulation of N-type Channel Inactivation—To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential effects of the β subunits on the voltage-dependent inactivation rates of Cav2.2, a series of 22 chimeras were created that combined structural features of parent β3 and β4 subunits. The chimera nomenclature denotes the identity of the variable and conserved regions (Fig. 1). For example, β33434 contains β3 sequence in V1, C1, and C2, whereas V2 and V3 correspond to the β4 sequence. All of the 22 chimeras were then individually co-expressed with Cav2.2 + α2-δ1, and the biophysical properties of the resulting calcium channel populations were assessed. In each case, the half-activation potentials closely aligned with those observed in the presence of the two wild type β subunits (not shown); hence, any putative effects of the chimeras on inactivation kinetics would unlikely be due to altered voltage dependence of activation gating. In addition, there was no significant difference in half-inactivation potentials (not shown). Whole cell conductances observed in the presence of the various chimeras were highly variable, ranging from ∼10 to 40 nS. Fig. 3A summarizes the time constants of inactivation obtained with Cav2.2 channels in the presence of the wild type and chimeric β subunits. As seen in the figure, the co-expression of the chimeric β subunits results in inactivation time constants that span virtually the entire range of values observed with the two wild type constructs. Statistical analysis of the data set indicates that the inactivation time constants of seven chimeras (data above the dotted line in Fig. 3A) are different from wild type β3, whereas sixteen chimeras (data below the dashed line in Fig. 3A) yielded inactivation time constants that differed significantly from those of β4-containing channels (ANOVA, p < 0.05). The time constant observed with the chimera β44343 differed significantly from those mediated by both wild type β subunits. Closer inspection of the data reveals that individually replacing the C1, V2, C2, and V3 domains of β4 with β3 sequence did not significantly accelerate Cav2.2 channel inactivation. Only the exchange of the V1 domain resulted in inactivation kinetics that resembled those seen with wild type β3. Indeed, with one exception (β33443), any chimera containing β3 sequence in the V1 domain yielded inactivation kinetics statistically indistinguishable from wild type β3. However, although these data implicate the V1 domain as a crucial structural element in β3 subunit function, replacement of the V1 domain in wild type β3 (β43333) did not produce a slowing of inactivation kinetics. Concomitant substitution of the C1 domain (β44333), the C2 domain (β43343), or the C2 + V3 domains (β43344) still maintained the rapidly inactivating phenotype. These data suggest that there is a second structural entity that is capable of conferring rapid inactivation kinetics independently of the V1 region. Yet, as stated above, no other single domain was capable of inducing rapid inactivation characteristics, thus suggesting that regions outside of V1 must work cooperatively to promote rapid inactivation. Indeed, in chimeras where V1 was of β4 origin, the presence of β3 sequence in the V2 + C1 regions or in the V2 + C2 regions resulted in rapid β3-like inactivation. In contrast, the C2 + V3 or the V2 + V3 combinations were ineffective. These data suggest that although the V1 domain appears to be a major determinant of Cav2.2 calcium channel inactivation, the β3 subunit V2 region in combination with one of the conserved domains can also contribute significantly to regulating Cav2.2 inactivation. In our hands, co-expression of the Cav2.2 + α2-δ1 subunit with either wild type β3, wild type β4, or chimeric β subunits did not result in a consistent increase in current densities compared with channels lacking the β subunit altogether. Hence, for β subunits that did not significantly alter the inactivation properties of the channel (i.e. β4, β33443, β44433, β44434, β44344, β44443, β43444, and β4), it is difficult to rule out by electrophysiological means the possibility that the lack of effect on channel gating might perhaps have arisen from a lack of functional association between the channel and these β subunits. Hence, we transfected Cav2.2 α1 subunits, α2-δ1, and several of the β subunit constructs that mediated a slowly inactivating phenotype and carried out co-immunoprecipitations using a Cav2.2-selective antibody for the immunoprecipitation and a β4 subunit-selective antibody for Western blot detection. As shown in Fig. 3B, the wild type and chimeric β subunits were effectively immunoprecipitated by the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit, whereas no β subunit signal was detected in cells in which β subunit cDNA was omitted during transfection. These data show that β subunit constructs that do not alter the inactivation characteristics of the channel are indeed properly expressed in tsA-201 cells and that they associate with the Cav2.2 calcium channel α1 subunit. The above considerations concerning β subunit structural determinants of inactivation were based exclusively on the examination of the effects of placing β3 sequence into the overall wild type β4 subunit backbone. To examine in greater detail the effects of individual variable and conserved β subunit regions, we extended our analysis across the whole set of chimeras, such that inactivation time constants were compared among chimera pairs that differed only in the identity of the V1 (Fig. 4A), C1 (Fig. 4B),V2 (Fig. 4C), C2 (Fig. 4D), or V3 (Fig. 4E) domains. As indicated in the figure, the substitution of the V1, V2, and C2 domains into chimeric β subunits tended to further accelerate inactivation kinetics, consistent with the considerations raised earlier. However, in some cases, the C1 domain also appeared to be able to affect inactivation rates. To obtain a semi-quantitative measure of these trends, the change in inactivation time constants that resulted from the replacement of β4 sequence with corresponding β3 sequence in a particular domain (τ(D4) - τ(D3)) was normalized to the difference in the inactivation time constants between a given chimera and wild type β3 (τ(D4) - τ(β3)). The data for all existing chimera pairs were av"

In this study, we found that the transcriptional activity of human Erg (one of the Ets family-transcription factors) was repressed by several nuclear receptors, including human estrogen receptor ERalpha, nonsteroid receptors and orphan receptors. Conversely, Erg inhibited ERalpha-dependent transcription. These reciprocal functional interactions extended to other nuclear receptors such as thyroid hormone and retinoic acid receptors, as well as to Fli1, an ERG-related ETS factor. Although similarly inhibited by overexpression of the orphan nuclear receptors ERR1 and RORalpha, ERG activity was unaffected by either REV-ERBalpha1 or COUP-TFII. The antagonism between ERG and ERalpha did not depend on DNA binding inhibition or direct protein-protein interactions. Repression of ERalpha-dependent transcription required the carboxyterminal and aminoterminal transactivation domains of Erg whereas the carboxyterminal AF-2 domain of ERalpha was necessary for repression of Erg activity. Reciprocal inhibition between Erg and ERalpha was not alleviated by overexpressing CBP, SRC-1 or RIP 140, three nuclear coactivator proteins. A negative cross-talk observed between Erg and ERalpha expands their potential range of regulation and may be relevant in vivo, particularly in endothelial, urogenital and cartilaginous tissues where both factors are expressed."
