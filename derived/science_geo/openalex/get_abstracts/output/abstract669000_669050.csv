https://openalex.org/W3131357458,"Primary brain and other central nervous system (CNS) cancers cause major burdens. In this study, we introduced a measure named the Quality of Care Index (QCI), which indirectly evaluates the quality of care given to patients with this group of cancers. Here we aimed to compare different geographic and socioeconomic patterns of CNS cancer care according to the novel measure introduced. In this regard, we acquired age-standardized primary epidemiologic measures were acquired from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 1990-2017. The primary measures were combined to make four secondary indices which all of them indirectly show the quality of care given to patients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was utilized to calculate the essential component named QCI. Further analyses were made based on QCI to assess the quality of care globally, regionally, and nationally (with a scale of 0-100 which higher values represent better quality of care). For 2017, the global calculated QCI was 55.0. QCI showed a desirable condition in higher socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles. Oppositely, low SDI quintile countries (7.7) had critically worse care quality. Western Pacific Region with the highest (76.9) and African Region with the lowest QCIs (9.9) were the two WHO regions extremes. Singapore was the country with the maximum QCI of 100, followed by Japan (99.9) and South Korea (98.9). In contrast, Swaziland (2.5), Lesotho (3.5), and Vanuatu (3.9) were countries with the worse condition. While the quality of care for most regions was desirable, regions with economic constraints showed to have poor quality of care and require enforcements toward this lethal diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3129485466,"Background Uganda has a unique set up comprised of resource-constrained economy, social-economic challenges, politically diverse regional neighborhood and home to long-standing refuge crisis that comes from long and protracted conflicts of the great lakes. The devastation of the on-going global pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is likely to be escalated by these circumstances with expectations of the impact of the disease being severe. Materials and methods In this study, we formulate a mathematical model that incorporates the currently known disease characteristics and tracks various intervention measures that the government of Uganda has implemented since the reporting of the first case in March 2020. We then evaluate these measures to understand levels of responsiveness and adherence to standard operating procedures and quantify their impact on the disease burden. Novel in this model was the unique aspect of modeling the trace-and-isolate protocol in which some of the latently infected individuals tested positive while in strict isolation centers thereby reducing their infectious period. Results The study findings show that even with elimination of all imported cases at any given time it would take up to nine months to rid Uganda of the disease. The findings also show that the optimal timing of easing of lockdowns while mitigating the possibility of re-emergence of a second epidemic wave requires avoiding the scenario of releasing too-many-too-soon. It is even more worrying that enhancing contact tracing would only affect the magnitude and timing of the second wave but cannot prevent it altogether. Conclusion We conclude that, given the prevailing circumstances, a phased-out lifting of lockdown measures, minimization of COVID-19 transmissibility within hospital settings, elimination of recruitment of infected individuals as well as enhanced contact tracing would be key to preventing overwhelming of the healthcare system that would come with dire consequences."
https://openalex.org/W3132704259,"Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria are an increasingly significant clinical threat globally. This risk may be underestimated in Kenya as only four carbapenemase genes in three bacterial species have been described. The study aimed to understand the antibiotic resistance profiles, genes, sequence types, and distribution of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria from patients in six hospitals across five Kenyan counties by bacterial culture, antibiotic susceptibility testing, and whole-genome sequence analysis. Forty-eight, non-duplicate, carbapenem non-susceptible, clinical isolates were identified across the five counties (predominantly in Nairobi and Kisii): twenty-seven Acinetobacter baumannii , fourteen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , three Escherichia coli , two Enterobacter cloacae , and two Klebsiella pneumoniae . All isolates were non-susceptible to Î²-lactam drugs with variable susceptibility to tigecycline (66%), minocycline (52.9%), tetracycline (29.4%), and levofloxacin (22.9%). Thirteen P . aeruginosa isolates were resistant to all antibiotics tested. Eleven carbapenemase genes were identified: bla NDM-1, bla OXA-23, -58, -66, -69, and -91 in A . baumannii ( STs 1, 2, 164 and a novel ST1475), bla NDM-1 in E . cloacae (STs 25,182), bla NDM-1 , bla VIM-1and -6 , bla OXA-50 in P . aeruginosa (STs 316, 357, 654, and1203), bla OXA-181, bla NDM-1 in K . pneumoniae (STs 147 and 219), and bla NDM-5 in E . coli (ST164). Five A . baumannii isolates had two carbapenemases, bla NDM-1, and either bla OXA-23 (4) or bla OXA-58 (1). AmpC genes were detected in A . baumannii (bla ADC-25 ), E . cloacae ( bla DHA-1 and bla ACT-6, 16 ), and K . pneumoniae (bla CMY ). Significant multiple-drug resistant genes were the pan-aminoglycoside resistance16srRNA methyltransferase arm A, rmt B, rmt C, and rmt F genes. This study is the first to report bla OXA-420, -58, -181, VIM-6, and bla NDM-5 in Kenyan isolates. High-risk STs of A . baumannii (ST1475, ST2), E . cloacae ST182, K . pneumoniae ST147, P . aeruginosa (ST357, 654), and E . coli ST167, ST648 were identified which present considerable therapeutic danger. The study recommends urgent carbapenem use regulation and containment of high-risk carbapenem-resistant bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3131302457,"This study aimed to identify the specimen type that has high positivity and its proper sampling time for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing to promote diagnostic efficiency. All SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis in Zhoushan City were followed up for viral shedding in respiratory tract specimens and faecal samples. Positivity was analysed both qualitatively and quantitatively by proper statistical approaches with strong testing power. Viral shedding in respiratory tract and faecal specimens was prolonged to 45 and 40 days after the last exposure, respectively. The overall positive rate in respiratory tract specimens was low and relatively unstable, being higher in the early-to-mid stage than in the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. Compared with respiratory tract specimens, faecal samples had a higher viral load, higher overall positive rate, and more stable positivity in different disease courses and varied symptomatic status. Faecal specimens have the potential ability to surpass respiratory tract specimens in virus detection. Testing of faecal specimens in diagnosis, especially for identifying asymptomatic carriers, is recommended. Simultaneously, testing respiratory tract specimens at the early-to-mid stage is better than testing at the mid-to-late stage of the disease course. A relatively small sample size was noted, and statistical approaches were used to address it. Information was missing for both specimen types at different stages of the disease course due to censored data. Our research extends the observed viral shedding in both specimen types and highlights the importance of faecal specimen testing in SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Healthcare workers, patients, and the general public may all benefit from our study findings. Disposal of sewage from hospitals and residential areas should be performed cautiously because the virus sheds in faeces and can last for a long time."
https://openalex.org/W3133355527,"Within the AGC kinase superfamily, gene fusions resulting from chromosomal rearrangements have been most frequently described for protein kinase C (PKC), with gene fragments encoding either the C-terminal catalytic domain or the N-terminal regulatory moiety fused to other genes. Kinase fusions that eliminate regulatory domains are typically gain of function and often oncogenic. However, several quality control pathways prevent accumulation of aberrant PKC, suggesting that PKC fusions may paradoxically be loss of function. To explore this topic, we used biochemical, cellular, and genome editing approaches to investigate the function of fusions that retain the portion of the gene encoding either the catalytic domain or regulatory domain of PKC. Overexpression studies revealed that PKC catalytic domain fusions were constitutively active but vulnerable to degradation. Genome editing of endogenous genes to generate a cancer-associated PKC fusion resulted in cells with detectable levels of fusion transcript but no detectable protein. Hence, PKC catalytic domain fusions are paradoxically loss of function as a result of their instability, preventing appreciable accumulation of protein in cells. Overexpression of a PKC regulatory domain fusion suppressed both basal and agonist-induced endogenous PKC activity, acting in a dominant-negative manner by competing for diacylglycerol. For both catalytic and regulatory domain fusions, the PKC component of the fusion proteins mediated the effects of the full-length fusions on the parameters examined, suggesting that the partner protein is dispensable in these contexts. Taken together, our findings reveal that PKC gene fusions are distinct from oncogenic fusions and present a mechanism by which loss of PKC function occurs in cancer.

Protein kinase C (PKC) plays a critical role in cellular homeostasis, transducing signals initiated by receptor-mediated hydrolysis of phospholipids to regulate cellular processes such as apoptosis, migration, and proliferation (1Dempsey E.C.

With its activity finely tuned, dysregulation of PKC has been implicated in a multitude of diseases, including metabolic disorders, neurodegeneration, and most notably, cancer (4Noh H. King G.L.

Since PKC was identified as a high-affinity receptor for the tumor-promoting compounds phorbol esters in the 1980s, it was ascribed an oncogenic role (7Castagnag M. Yoshimi T. Kaibuchi K. Sano K.

However, recent analysis of cancer-associated point mutations in PKC revealed that they are generally loss of function (10Antal C.E. Hudson A.M. Kang E. Zanca C. Wirth C. Stephenson N.L. Trotter E.W.

Furthermore, high protein levels of PKC are associated with improved survival in diverse cancers, including colon cancer (14Dowling C.M. Phelan J. Callender J.A. Cathcart M.C. Mehigan B. McCormick P.

PHLPPing the balance: Restoration of protein kinase C in cancer.Biochem. J. 2021; 478: 341-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Gene fusions involving PKC have also been identified in cancer. Analysis of RNA sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reveals that approximately 15% of in-frame kinase fusions belong to members of the AGC superfamily of serine/threonine kinases, second only to the tyrosine kinase family (18Yoshihara K. Wang Q. Torres-Garcia W. Zheng S. Vegesna R. Kim H. Verhaak R.G.W. The landscape and therapeutic relevance of cancer-associated transcript fusions.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 4845-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Within the AGC kinases, the greatest abundance of gene fusions occurs in the PRKC genes (18Yoshihara K. Wang Q. Torres-Garcia W. Zheng S. Vegesna R. Kim H. Verhaak R.G.W. The landscape and therapeutic relevance of cancer-associated transcript fusions.Oncogene. 2015; 34: 4845-4854Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The PKC family, encoded by the PRKC genes, consists of nine isozymes, categorized into three classes: conventional (Î±, Î², Î³), novel (Î´, Îµ, Î·, Î¸), and atypical (Î¶, Î¹/Î») (19Newton A.C. Protein kinase C: Poised to signal.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 298: E395-E402Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). They all possess a C-terminal kinase domain that is constrained by a pseudosubstrate segment in the N-terminal regulatory moiety, serving to autoinhibit the enzyme in the absence of its second messengers. Release of autoinhibition occurs following engagement of the appropriate second messengers to membrane-targeting modules in the regulatory moiety. Conventional and novel isozymes of PKC are activated by binding of diacylglycerol (DAG) to one of their tandem C1 domains, with conventional isozymes also requiring binding of Ca2+ to their C2 domain for activation. Atypical isozymes respond to neither DAG nor Ca2+ but contain a protein-binding PB1 domain that mediates proteinâprotein interactions (20Tobias I.S. Newton A.C. Protein scaffolds control localized protein kinase CÎ¶ activity.J. Biol. Chem. 2016; 291: 13809-13822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Before PKC is catalytically competent, it is matured by a series of ordered phosphorylations that are necessary for the enzyme to adopt an autoinhibited conformation; these are the activation loop (Thr500 in PKCÎ²II), the turn motif (Thr641 in PKCÎ²II), and the hydrophobic motif (Ser660 in PKCÎ²II) (21Keranen L.M. Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Protein kinase C is regulated in vivo by three functionally distinct phosphorylations.Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1394-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Of these, phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif is indispensable for autoinhibition, and dephosphorylation of this site by the PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase PHLPP shunts PKC to degradative pathways (22Gao T. Brognard J. Newton A.C. The phosphatase PHLPP controls the cellular levels of protein kinase C.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6300-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, this autoinhibited conformation is dependent upon phosphorylation and is critical to ensuring PKC stability. Aberrant PKC that is not properly autoinhibited is degraded, subject to PHLPP-mediated quality control of PKC. This quality control presents a major mechanism for loss of PKC function in cancer (15Baffi T.R. Van A.A.N. Zhao W. Mills G.B. Newton A.C. Protein kinase C quality control by phosphatase PHLPP1 Unveils loss-of-function mechanism in cancer.Mol. Cell. 2019; 74: 378-392.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, cancer-associated mutations that disrupt autoinhibitory constraints are paradoxically loss of function because the constitutively active kinase is sensitive to degradation. This raises the question as to whether cancer-associated fusions in which the pseudosubstrate is replaced by a fusion partner will be unstable or whether they have mechanisms to evade quality control degradation. Here, we investigated PKC gene fusions that yield proteins retaining the catalytic domain of PKC (3' PKC fusions) as well as fusions that yield proteins retaining the regulatory domain of PKC (5' PKC fusions). Cell-based assays revealed that the overexpressed catalytic domain fusions were constitutively active but unable to retain processing phosphorylations. Thus, these fusions were unstable. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing to encode an endogenous 3' PKC fusion, we were able to detect the fusion at the mRNA level in CRISPR-edited cells but not at the protein level, consistent with the fusion protein being too unstable to accumulate in cells. Analysis of a 5' PKC fusion encoding the regulatory domain of PKC, with complete loss of the kinase domain, revealed that it functioned in a dominant-negative manner to suppress endogenous PKC activity. Taken together, these results identify PKC fusions as a mechanism for loss of PKC function in cancer. In order to assess the landscape of PKC fusions in cancer, we queried the literature and several online databases to curate a comprehensive list of all PKC gene fusions identified from patient tumor samples (Table S1) (18Yoshihara K.

With this list of fusions, we were able to ascertain that each of the nine isozymes from the three subclasses of the PKC family (Fig. 1A) was detected in at least one gene fusion (Fig. 1B). Although there were only seven isozymes for which there were fusions detected that retained the 5' end of PKC, there were fusions detected for all isozymes where the 3' end of PKC was retained. The greatest number of fusions was detected for PRKCA with 43 fusions identified, and the majority of these (19 fusions) were found in breast cancer samples. In total, 102 fusions were identified across all PKC family members. PKC gene fusions were detected in 26 different cancer types, from benign fibrous histiocytoma (BFH) to uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) (Fig. 1C). Among these different cancer types, the greatest number of PKC gene fusions was identified in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) with 31 fusions detected and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with nine fusions detected. Notably, approximately half of these fusions resulted in products that were out of frame (Table S1). Several of the fusions were detected in different cancer types, and a few fusions were recurrent (Table S2). Given that PKC is the most abundantly fused AGC kinase and the fusions were detected in a multitude of cancers, we sought to determine how these fusions might affect PKC signaling and contribute to tumorigenesis. To this end, we selected three 3' fusions (TANC2-PRKCA, SLC44A1-PRKCA, and GGA2-PRKCB) and one 5' fusion (PRKCA-CDH8) in this study for further analysis (18Yoshihara K. Wang Q. Torres-Garcia W.

TANC2-PRKCA encodes the first 45 amino acid residues of TANC2 fused to the last 496 residues of PKCÎ±, and SLC44A1-PRKCA encodes the first 650 residues of CTL1 fused to the last 366 residues of PKCÎ±. GGA2-PRKCB encodes the first 158 residues of GGA2 fused to the last 605 residues of PKCÎ²II. TANC2 has been identified as a scaffolding protein in dendritic spines, and CTL1 functions as a choline transporter (42Gasparini A. Tosatto S.C.E. Murgia A. Leonardi E.

GGA2 is part of the Golgi-localized, gamma adaptin ear-containing, ARF-binding (GGA) family of adaptor proteins, which localize to the trans-Golgi network and regulate protein trafficking (45Von Einem B.

The protein products resulting from the fusion transcripts retain the complete catalytic domain of PKC with some portion of the regulatory domain. Specifically, TANC2-PKCÎ± retains the C2 domain and GGA2-PKCÎ²II retains the C1B and C2 domains, whereas CTL1-PKCÎ± only retains part of the hinge between the regulatory and catalytic moieties. Notably, the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate, located at the N terminus, is lost in all three fusion proteins. In our biochemical analysis of these catalytic domain fusions, we also analyzed N-deletion proteins in which we delete the fusion partner and retain only the PKC portion of the fusion. Additionally, we analyzed a variant of the CTL1-PKCÎ± fusion protein in which there was an internal deletion within CTL1 (35Bridge J.A. Liu X.Q. Sumegi J. Nelson M. Reyes C. Bruch L.A. Rosenblum M. Puccioni M.J. Bowdino B.S. McComb R.D.

Phosphorylation at the three PKC priming sites, the activation loop, turn motif, and hydrophobic motif, is necessary for catalytic competency. Thus, we determined whether the fusion proteins and their variants are also phosphorylated at these sites. Whereas wild-type PKC was constitutively phosphorylated at all three processing sites, the full-length fusion proteins TANC2-PKCÎ±, CTL1-PKCÎ±, and GGA2-PKCÎ²II were not (Fig. 2B). The PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²II N-deletion proteins, comprising only the PKC portion of the fusion, as well as the CTL1-PKCÎ± internal deletion (Int. Del.) protein, were also not appreciably phosphorylated at the activation loop, turn motif, or hydrophobic motif; neither were constructs in which the pseudosubstrate was deleted (ÎPS). We have previously reported that mutations that impair autoinhibition of PKC prevent retention of phosphate at the priming sites (15Baffi T.R. Van A.A.N. Zhao W. Mills G.B. Newton A.C. Protein kinase C quality control by phosphatase PHLPP1 Unveils loss-of-function mechanism in cancer.Mol. Cell. 2019; 74: 378-392.e5Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Lack of phosphorylation at the priming sites of these proteins is consistent with that of PKCÎ± and PKCÎ²II proteins where the pseudosubstrate is deleted (ÎPS). In summary, both the full-length fusion proteins and the N-deletion proteins lacked phosphorylation at the priming sites. We next addressed whether the fusion proteins exhibited catalytic activity, as assessed with the genetically encoded, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based reporter for PKC activity, C kinase activity reporter (CKAR) (46Violin J.D.

Stimulation of COS7 cells expressing mCherry-tagged wild-type PKC (blue) resulted in a transient increase in CKAR phosphorylation upon treatment with the physiological agonist UTP, which generates Ca2+ and DAG. Subsequent treatment with the phorbol ester PDBu resulted in maximal, sustained activity, which was abolished upon addition of PKC inhibitor, either GÓ§6976 or GÓ§6983 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, the full-length fusion proteins (red) were maximally active under basal conditions and did not respond to the addition of UTP or PDBu. However, ad"

Structurally characterized GlyRs are generally engineered to have a very short ICD. We show here that for one such construct, zebrafish GlyREM, the agonists glycine, Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA have high efficacy and produce maximum single-channel open probabilities greater than 0.9. In contrast, for full-length human Î±1 GlyR, taurine and GABA were clearly partial agonists, with maximum open probabilities of 0.46 and 0.09, respectively. We found that the elevated open probabilities in GlyREM are not due to the limited sequence differences between the human and zebrafish orthologs, but rather to replacement of the native ICD with a short tripeptide ICD. Consistent with this interpretation, shortening the ICD in the human GlyR increased the maximum open probability produced by taurine and GABA to 0.90 and 0.70, respectively, but further engineering it to resemble GlyREM (by introducing the zebrafish transmembrane helix 4 and C terminus) had no effect. Furthermore, reinstating the native ICD to GlyREM converted taurine and GABA to partial agonists, with maximum open probabilities of 0.66 and 0.40, respectively. Structural comparison of transmembrane helices 3 and 4 in short- and long-ICD GlyR subunits revealed that ICD shortening does not distort the orientation of these helices within each subunit. This suggests that the effects of shortening the ICD stem from removing a modulatory effect of the native ICD on GlyR gating, revealing a new role for the ICD in pentameric ligand-gated channels.

Glycine receptors (GlyRs) belong to the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGIC). Like another member of this group, GABA receptors, GlyRs are permeable to anions and mediate inhibitory synaptic currents, but these are faster than those mediated by GABA and are particularly important in the spinal cord and brainstem. In heterologous expression systems, functional GlyRs can be assembled as homomers of Î± subunits or as heteromers of Î± and Î² subunits and these heteromeric receptors are thought to be the synaptic form of GlyRs in the adult mammalian central nervous system (1Lynch J.W. Molecular structure and function of the glycine receptor chloride channel.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1051-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). GlyR subunits follow the general fold of the pLGIC family and each subunit has an extracellular domain (ECD), a transmembrane domain (TMD) formed by four Î±-helices (TM1âTM4) and a large intracellular domain (ICD) between the TM3 and TM4 helices. The neurotransmitter/agonist-binding sites are at the interfaces between the ECDs of adjacent subunits, and the pore, with its activation and desensitization gates, is formed by the TM2 helices. These features were confirmed specifically for GlyR by the solution of crystal structures of homomeric human Î±3 GlyR and cryo-EM structures of zebrafish Î±1 GlyR (2Du J. LÃ¼ W. Wu S. Cheng Y.

Neither of these sets of data gives us information about the ICD, because both were obtained from constructs where the ICD (which is up to â¼80 amino acids long in GlyR) had been replaced by an AGT tripeptide linker. Ablation of the ICD is an almost universal feature in structural work on pLGICs, and the first high resolution structures of channels in this superfamily were obtained from prokaryotic pLGICs, such as ELIC and GLIC (5Bocquet N. Nury H. Baaden M. Le Poupon C. Changeux J.P. Delarue M. Corringer P.J.

X-ray structure of a prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel.Nature. 2008; 452: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), where the TM3âTM4 linker is naturally very short. The main functional features of pLGICs are thought to survive the replacement of the native ICD with the heptapeptide TM3âTM4 linker found in GLIC or with an AGT tripeptide, and this has been shown in 5-HT3 receptors, GABA Ï channels (7Jansen M.

As structural work is undertaken to explore the determinants of agonist efficacy in pLGICs, we tried to identify GlyR agonists that are reliably partial on GlyR constructs that could be characterized in structural investigations, and started with GlyREM, the zebrafish Î±1 construct used by Du et al. (2Du J. LÃ¼ W. Wu S. Cheng Y. Gouaux E. Glycine receptor mechanism elucidated by electron cryo-microscopy.Nature. 2015; 526: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Our single-channel measurements of maximum open channel probability for a set of four agonists, from the full agonist Gly to the weak partial agonist GABA, show that the efficacy of partial agonists is much higher in the ICD-less GlyREM construct than in the human WT Î±1 homomeric GlyR. Although the sequences of the human and zebrafish GlyR subunits have a few differences, we show that most of the increase in agonist efficacy was due to the drastic shortening of the ICD. This increase could be reproduced in the human GlyR by ICD excision and reversed in the zebrafish receptor by ICD re-insertion, pointing out to a role for the ICD in modulating the efficacy of agonist gating. Fig. 1 shows whole cell responses to agonists of recombinant homomeric Î±1 GlyR expressed in HEK293 cells. The data in panel A are from human WT GlyR, and those in panel B are from zebrafish GlyREM, a receptor construct for cryoEM structure determination that is engineered to have a tripeptide linker in place of the ICD. We tested as agonists glycine, Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA, and applied them by U-tube at concentrations up to 300 mm. The time course of the current responses (top panels) was similar for the two receptors and the different agonists and showed the features expected of agonist responses from a pLGIC. As agonist concentrations increased, responses increased in amplitude, reaching their peak more quickly and also declining from this peak more quickly because of faster desensitization. Peak current responses were normalized to the response to a 10 mm glycine standard in each cell (last response in each set of traces) and plotted as dose-response curves in the bottom two panels (see Table 1 for the parameters of Hill equation fits to the data). Zebrafish GlyREM was more sensitive to agonists, and EC50 values of each agonist were between 2.5- and 5-fold lower for this receptor than for the human GlyR Î±1 (Table 1). The rank order of potency and efficacy was similar for the two receptors, with glycine >Î²-alanine > taurine > GABA (and is in line with the literature for human GlyR and zebrafish GlyR, (10Schmieden V.

However, the two receptors were strikingly different when the size of the agonist maximum responses was compared. Thus, in human WT Î±1 GlyR, Î²-alanine is clearly a partial agonist that elicits a maximum response that is 73% of that of glycine, taurine is even weaker (25%), and GABA is almost completely ineffective as agonist (1.7%). In contrast to that, on the zebrafish Î±1 GlyREM, Î²-alanine is almost a full agonist, eliciting a maximum response that is 93% of that to glycine, and both taurine and GABA are much more efficacious (74 and 62%) than on human receptors (p < 0.005 for all agonists; see Table 1 and Table S1).Table 1Whole cell recordingsWhole cell parametersGlyRGlycineÎ²-AlanineTaurineGABAImax glycine (nA)Human Î±1 GlyR Irelâ0.73 Â± 0.110.25 Â± 0.090.017 Â± 0.02013.2 Â± 3 EC50 (Î¼M)240 Â± 60860 Â± 2502,000 Â± 40061,000 Â± 14,000 nH1.57 Â± 0.221.5 Â± 0.241.30 Â± 0.111.32 Â± 0.07 n10675Zebrafish Î±1 GlyR Irelâ0.84 Â± 0.090.40 Â± 0.200.14 Â± 0.139.0 Â± 1.4 EC50 (Î¼M)190 Â± 60340 Â± 1901050 Â± 22028,400 Â± 3,000 nH1.9 Â± 0.31.34 Â± 0.191.26 Â± 0.121.59 Â± 0.17 n81068Human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD Irelâ0.85 Â± 0.040.55 Â± 0.070.07 Â± 0.032.8 Â± 1.0 EC50 (Î¼m)140 Â± 20450 Â± 1901500 Â± 21033,200 Â± 11,000 nH1.43 Â± 0.381.25 Â± 0.241.05 Â± 0.161.42 Â± 0.17 n5456Human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD + TM4 zebrafish Irelâ0.86 Â± 0.070.56 Â± 0.060.10 Â± 0.042.2 Â± 0.6 EC50 (Î¼m)180 Â± 32320 Â± 701480 Â± 57093,200 Â± 45,000 nH1.19 Â± 0.201.56 Â± 0.241.03 Â± 0.190.98 Â± 0.11 n8775Zebrafish Î±1 GlyREM Irelâ0.93 Â± 0.030.74 Â± 0.130.62 Â± 0.123.3 Â± 0.8 EC50 (Î¼m)92 Â± 10170 Â± 90390 Â± 14012,400 Â± 4000 nH1.6 Â± 0.41.17 Â± 0.151.03 Â± 0.111.26 Â± 0.22 n46514Agonist efficacy and sensitivity values were estimated from the fit of dose-response curves and are presented as mean Â± S.D.

Irel, maximum current normalized to that of glycine in the same cell. To obtain better estimates of agonist efficacy in the two GlyRs, we switched to single-channel experiments, recording the effect of saturating concentrations of each agonist. Fig. 2A shows a typical cell-attached single-channel trace at high glycine concentration. Most of the time the patch is silent because all the channels in the patch are desensitized (dashed line under the trace). Every now and again a channel emerges from desensitization, gives rise to a âcluster,â a group of openings (the upwards deflections in the trace) separated by short shut times, and desensitizes again. During a cluster, the channel open probability is high enough that we can be sure that only one channel is active (no double openings are seen) and we can measure the maximum open probability produced by the agonist on a single channel molecule (cf. values marked on top of each cluster). This is a true equilibrium measurement in the absence of desensitization, it is an absolute measurement and can be obtained for all agonists, including glycine. This is a considerable advantage, cf. whole cell experiments, where peak currents are the expression of concurrent activation and desensitization (to an extent that depends on actual rate of agonist exchange at the receptor) and the responses have to be normalized to a glycine standard. Another advantage of single-channel recording is that very small amounts of agonist are needed for each cell-attached experiment. This made it possible to use our limited supply of purified agonists, which contain less than 1 part contaminant glycine in 600,000. Fig. 2B shows representative single channel cluster openings produced by saturating concentrations of agonists on the human Î±1 GlyR (on the left) and on the zebrafish GlyREM (on the right). In both GlyRs, the clusters produced by glycine (top two traces and Fig. 2A) have a high open probability, with relatively few short shuttings, as expected for a full agonist. Effectively, receptors bound to glycine are either open or desensitized. The situation is different for the other agonists. Traces from the human Î±1 GlyR show a clear gradient in open probability and agonist efficacy: there is a visible increase in the proportion of shut time in the cluster, as we move from glycine to Î²-alanine to taurine and efficacy decreases. The clusters look darker because of the number of shuttings and brief openings, which are unresolved to the eye at this scale. In the case of GABA (bottom traces), the Popen is even lower, the shut times are longer and clearly visible between the short openings in the cluster. Fig. 2C is a plot of all cluster open probability values, where each value is represented by a point (the same data are summarized in Table 2). This plot shows that in human Î±1 GlyRs the maximum Popen declines progressively from glycine to Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA, with averages of 0.97, 0.78, 0.46, and 0.09. This pattern is clear despite substantial cluster-to-cluster Popen variability, especially for the agonists with intermediate efficacy, such as Î²-alanine and taurine. The same experiments in zebrafish GlyREM (Fig. 2B, right) produced a very different pattern, where all agonists produced similar high open probability clusters, which looked similar to glycine clusters. Plotting the Popen values in the graph in Fig. 2C (red points) shows that the average maximum Popen values were around or above 0.90, with agonists glycine, Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA producing 0.98, 0.97, 0.95, and 0.90 Popen, respectively. There was no difference in the maximum Popen of glycine on the two receptors (p = 0.34). However, all agonists that were partial on human Î±1 GlyRs produced a significantly higher maximum Popen for zebrafish GlyREM (p < 0.005). As the average Popen increased, the extent of cluster-to-cluster variability decreased, also resembling the properties of the full agonist glycine. Thus the single-channel experiments strongly confirmed that agonists that are partial on human Î±1 GlyR are much more efficacious on zebrafish GlyREM channels.Table 2Single channel parameters measured for five GlyRsSingle-channel parametersGlyRGlycineÎ²-AlanineTaurineGABAAmplitude (pA)Human Î±1 GlyR maxPopen0.97 Â± 0.110.78 Â± 0.240.46 Â± 0.200.09 Â± 0.085.96 Â± 0.70 npatches (nclusters)5 (47)5 (124)11 (144)13 (59)Zebrafish Î±1 GlyR maxPopen0.97 Â± 0.050.91 Â± 0.210.66 Â± 0.240.40 Â± 0.255.45 Â± 0.92 npatches (nclusters)10 (48)7 (30)10 (71)11 (83)Human a1 GlyR ÎICD maxPopen0.99 Â± 0.010.92 Â± 0.070.90 Â± 0.100.70 Â± 0.214.11 Â± 0.72 npatches (nclusters)5 (26)6 (26)10 (33)4 (37)Human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD + TM4 zebrafish maxPopen0.98 Â± 0.020.88 Â± 0.160.89 Â± 0.120.73 Â± 0.243.63 Â± 0.88 npatches (nclusters)4 (16)7 (29)6 (41)4 (43)Zebrafish Î±1 GlyR ÎICD maxPopen0.99 Â± 0.020.98 Â± 0.050.93 Â± 0.130.89 Â± 0.134.74 Â± 1.10 npatches (nclusters)5 (32)9 (25)7 (26)5 (23)Zebrafish Î±1 GlyREM maxPopen0.98 Â± 0.020.97 Â± 0.080.95 Â± 0.100.90 Â± 0.145.54 Â± 1.59 npatches (nclusters)10 (42)9 (54)17 (55)7 (77)The values are presented as mean Â± S.D. Open table in a new tab The values are presented as mean Â± S.D. These differences seemed surprising, given that the two receptors have a high degree of sequence similarity. Apart from the ICD, the human Î±1 GlyR and zebrafish Î±1 GlyREM differ only in 25 amino acids (12 are in ECD, one in TM1, 2 in TM3, and 10 in TM4, and none of the differences are in the residues involved in binding glycine (14Pless S.A. Sivilotti L.G. A tale of ligands big and small: An update on how pentameric ligand-gated ion channels interact with agonists and proteins.Curr. Opin. Physiol. 2019; 2: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) (see Fig. S1)). The most obvious difference between the two GlyRs is the ICD, more specifically its absence in GlyREM. Thus we generated a new GlyR construct by replacing the large ICD from the human GlyR Î±1 with a short tripeptide linker (AGT), the same that was used as TM3âTM4 linker in GlyREM (see Fig. S1). Fig. 3 shows our characterization of this human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD receptor. ICD excision had no apparent effect on the time course of agonist whole-cell current responses (Fig. 3A). However, there was an obvious change in the concentration-response curves, where the maximum responses to taurine and GABA were increased, to 55 and 7% of the glycine maximum (cf. 25 and 1.7% in WT, p < 0.005, respectively; Table 1). Maximum glycine responses for the human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD were significantly smaller (p<0.005) than for WT, suggesting that constructs with a short ICD either have a low expression (15Langlhofer G. Villmann C. The role of charged residues in independent glycine receptor folding domains for intermolecular interactions and ion channel function.J. Neurochem. 2017; 142: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) or have a toxic effect for cells that express them at high levels. Experiments with single- channel recordings proved to be challenging with the human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD constructs, because in the majority of patches no channel activity was detected. We hypothesized that the presence of glycine (400 Î¼M) in our standard (Dulbeccoâs modified Eagleâs medium (DMEM)) culture medium reduced the survival of high expressing cells. To increase the success rate of the single channel recordings, we switched the growth media to MEM (Gibco, 11095080), which does not contain glycine in its formulation. The increase in agonist efficacy produced by ICD excision was confirmed by single-channel recordings: the traces in Fig. 3B show that in the human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD all agonists produced long, high open probability clusters, where openings were separated by short unresolved shuttings. These clusters were similar to those observed with glycine in WT receptors and to those observed with all agonists in zebrafish GlyREM. The boxplots in Fig. 3C provide an overall view, and compare cluster Popen values for the WT GlyR (black) and GlyR ÎICD (green). The increase in open probability after ICD excision are very clear for all agonists except glycine (p = 0.34), which was already a very efficacious agonist on WT GlyR, with a Popen of 0.97 and 0.99 in WT GlyR and GlyR ÎICD, respectively. The increase in maximum Popen was large for the two agonists with lower efficacy in WT, taurine, and GABA whose maximum Popen increased from 0.46 to 0.90 (p < 0.005) and from 0.09 to 0.70 (p < 0.005), respectively (Fig. 2C, Table 2). These higher values approach, but do not quite reach, those observed in zebrafish Î±1 GlyREM, where GABA produced a maximum Popen of 0.90. If excising the ICD was responsible for much of increased agonist efficacy observed in GlyREM, we would expect partial agonists to be less efficacious in WT zebrafish receptors that carry a normal amino acid ICD (almost 70 residues long). Fig. 4 shows that this is exactly what we found. In the zebrafish WT Î±1 GlyR, the time course of agonist-evoked current responses was the same as in the other receptors we examined (top panel of Fig. 4A). However, the dose-response curves (bottom panel of Fig. 4A) show that in zebrafish WT Î±1 GlyR the maximum responses to partial agonists (relative to glycine) were smaller, particularly for taurine and GABA (compare with Fig. 1B). This decrease in efficacy was associated with a consistent decrease in agonist sensitivity, producing EC50 values â¼2-fold higher (see results of the Hill equation fits, Table 1, Fig. S1). As we observed for human GlyRs with and without ICD, the absolute amplitude of maximum glycine currents (Imax) was higher in the zebrafish GlyR with its native ICD (Table 1), again suggesting that the native ICD supports receptor trafficking and expression levels. Results from single-channel recordings (Fig. 4B) confirmed the whole cell data. The clusters of openings at high agonist concentrations appear different for the different agonists and reach mean maximum Popen values of 0.97, 0.91, 0.66, and 0.40, for glycine, Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA, respectively. The boxplots in Fig. 4C show markedly lower (p < 0.005) efficacy for taurine and GABA in the WT GlyR (blue) versus GlyREM (black). Thus, the presence or absence of a long intracellular domain affects agonist efficacy in the GlyRs from both species. As the sequences in the alignment in Fig. S1 show, GlyREM differs from the WT zebrafish GlyR not only in the absence of the ICD, but also in the presence of a thrombin cleavage site at the C terminus. As a further control, we have measured agonist maximum Popen in a zebrafish receptor in which we have replaced the ICD with the AGT tripeptide. The values we recorded in this receptor (dark gray in Fig. 4C) were indistinguishable from those measured in GlyREM (p < 0.005). Although the pattern of agonist efficacy in the full-length zebrafish GlyR resembles that in the human Î±1 GlyR, it is not identical, and partial agonists remain somewhat more efficacious in zebrafish GlyRs (Table 2). The biggest difference is seen for GABA, which in zebrafish Î±1 GlyR produced a maximum Popen â¼4 times higher than in human Î±1 GlyR (p < 0.005; Figs. 2C and 4C; similar results were obtained at whole-cell level, Figs. 1A and 4A, and for receptors in which the ICD was excised, see Figs. 2C and 3C). This is not surprising, as we would expect agonist efficacy to be affected also by receptor differences in domains other than the ICD. As shown in Fig. S1, many of the differences between zebrafish and human GlyR outside the ICD are in the TM4 helix (10 residues) and in the short C terminus at its end (4 residues). The TM4 helix is relatively poorly conserved across different isoforms of GlyR within the same species, and differences in TM4 have been proposed to be responsible for the much lower efficacy of partial agonists Î²-alanine and taurine on Î±3 versus Î±1 GlyR (16Chen X. Webb T.I. Lynch J.W. The M4 transmembrane segment contributes to agonist efficacy differences between Î±1 and Î±3 glycine receptors.Mol. Membr. Biol. 2009; 26: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Rather than selecting specific point mutations, we spliced the whole of the TM4 together with the C terminus from WT zebrafish GlyR into the human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD to produce a chimeric GlyR (human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD + zebrafish TM4). Whole-cell dose-response curves for our standard group of agonists glycine, Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA, are shown in Fig. 5A. Maximum currents produced by 10 mm glycine for the chimera were the smallest of all the constructs, suggesting particularly low levels of expression (Table 1), and it was difficult to obtain well-determined dose-response curves for the weakest partial agonist, GABA. With this limitation, insertion of the zebrafish TM4 and C terminus did not change appreciably the apparent efficacy of partial agonists, as the maximum currents for the partial agonists relative to glycine were very similar in the chimeric GlyR and in human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD, with 0.86, 0.56, and 0.1 for Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA, respectively (cf. 0.85, 0.55, and 0.07 in human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD, Table 2; see Figs. 5A and 3A). The cell-attached single-channel measurements in the chimera (orange) and human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD (black; Fig. 5C) confirm this finding is robust as they gave maximum Popen values that were indistinguishable, at 0.98, 0.88, 0.89, and 0.73, for the chimera and 0.99, 0.92, 0.90, and 0.70 for the Î±1 GlyR ÎICD for glycine, Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA, respectively (differences did not reach statistical significance). Thus, on the background of an ICD-less receptor, splicing the zebrafish TM4 and C terminus into the human GlyR had no clear effect on efficacy. In the zebrafish GlyR ÎICD we had found the maximum Popen to GABA to be similar to that of the other agonists at about 0.90, but this was not the case for the human Î±1 GlyR ÎICD + zebrafish TM4, where it remains well below the value for taurine. The two receptors differ from one another in the extracellular domain, 1 amino acid in TM1 and in 2 amino acids at the cytoplasmic end of TM3. Our study shows that drastic shortening of the ICD in GlyRs greatly increases agonist efficacy. To our knowledge, this effect has not been reported before, and our data show that it is a robust finding that is not confined to or specific for a single agonist. The enhancement is most conspicuous for partial agonists, is seen in two GlyRs from different species, human and zebrafish, and is consistently detected by two different methods for estimating efficacy, i.e. the amplitude of maximum whole cell currents relative to the full agonist glycine and the maximum single channel Popen. We tested a panel of four agonists, glycine, Î²-alanine, taurine, and GABA, whose efficacy values range from very high, for the full agonist glycine, to very low, for the weak partial agonist GABA. ICD shortening in the human GlyR had little or no effect on glycine (+2%), whose maximum Popen was 0.97 or more in all GlyR tested, but caused pronounced changes for taurine and GABA (+96 and+678%, from 0.46 to 0.90 and 0.09 to 0.70; human GlyR numbers). Reinstating the native ICD in the zebrafish GlyR had little or no effect on glycine responses (â1%), but reduced the maximum Popen for taurine (â31%) and GABA (â44%, respectively), from 0.95 to 0.66 and from 0.90 to 0.40. This difference in the size of the Popen effects with agonists of different efficacy is precisely what is expected if our ICD manipulations simply alter the ability of all agonists to gate the receptor, by enhancing channel opening. In current models of pLGIC activation (17Burzomato V. Beato M. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Colquhoun D. Sivilotti L.G. Single-channel behavior of heteromeric Î±1Î² glycine receptors: An attempt to detect a conformational change before the channel opens.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10924-10940Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), agonist-bound channels enter an intermediate state (âflip,â closed, but with higher agonist affinity) before opening. Thus, the maximum single channel Popen depends both on E, the opening equilibrium constant and F, the âflippingâ equilibrium constant.MaximumPopen=EFEF+F+1(Eq. 1) Agonists with different efficacy differ mostly in their ability to evoke the transition to the intermediate state described by the equilibrium constant F (the opening equilibrium constant E is similar for different agonists) (18Lape R. Colquhoun D. Sivilotti L.G. On the nature of partial agonism in the nicotinic receptor superfamily.Nature. 2008; 454: 722-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Equation 1 can be simplified to,MaximumPopen=EffEff+1(Eq. 2) where Eff is the overall gating constant for each agonist, Eff = (EF)/F+1). Equation 2 is the same as the relationship predicted by the simple delCastill"

Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1) generates antigenic peptides for presentation by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Coding SNPs in ERAP1 have been associated with predisposition to inflammatory rheumatic disease and shown to affect functional properties of the enzyme, but the interplay between combinations of these SNPs as they exist in allotypes has not been thoroughly explored. We used phased genotype data to estimate ERAP1 allotype frequency in 2504 individuals across five major human populations, generated highly pure recombinant enzymes corresponding to the ten most common ERAP1 allotypes, and systematically characterized their in vitro enzymatic properties. We find that ERAP1 allotypes possess a wide range of enzymatic activities, up to 60-fold, whose ranking is substrate dependent. Strikingly, allotype 10, previously associated with BehÃ§etâs disease, is consistently a low-activity outlier, suggesting that a significant percentage of individuals carry a subactive ERAP1 gene. Enzymatic analysis revealed that ERAP1 allotypes can differ in both catalytic efficiency and substrate affinity, differences that can change intermediate accumulation in multistep trimming reactions. Alterations in efficacy of an allosteric inhibitor that targets the regulatory site suggest that allotypic variation influences the communication between the regulatory and the active site. Our work defines the wide landscape of ERAP1 activity in human populations and demonstrates how common allotypes can induce substrate-dependent variability in antigen processing, thus contributing, in synergy with major histocompatibility complex haplotypes, to immune response variability and predisposition to chronic inflammatory conditions.

Our work defines the wide landscape of ERAP1 activity in human populations and demonstrates how common allotypes can induce substrate-dependent variability in antigen processing, thus contributing, in synergy with major histocompatibility complex haplotypes, to immune response variability and predisposition to chronic inflammatory conditions. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (human leukocyte antigens [HLAs] in humans) are the most polymorphic human genes with tens of thousands of different allomorphs identified to date (1Robinson J. Barker D.J. Georgiou X. Cooper M.A. Flicek P. Marsh S.G.E. IPD-IMGT/HLA database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: D948-D955PubMed Google Scholar). MHC class I (MHCI) molecules bind small protein fragments (peptides) that originate from normal cellular proteins or pathogen proteins and then translocate to the cell surface to present their cargo to cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (2Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Degradation of cell proteins and the generation of MHC class I-presented peptides.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). Polymorphic variation in MHCI predominantly affects the structure of the binding groove and allows the presentation of a large variety of peptide sequences. MHCIs bind their peptide cargo in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with the assistance of the peptide-loading complex (3Blees A. Januliene D. Hofmann T. Koller N. Schmidt C. Trowitzsch S. Moeller A. Tampe R. Structure of the human MHC-I peptide-loading complex.Nature. 2017; 551: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). While MHCI tend to bind peptides that are between 8 and 11 amino acids long (the majority of which are 9mers), many peptides that enter the ER can be substantially longer (4Cascio P. Hilton C. Kisselev A.F. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. 26S proteasomes and immunoproteasomes produce mainly N-extended versions of an antigenic peptide.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2357-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Two ER-resident aminopeptidases, ER aminopeptidase 1 and ER aminopeptidase 2 (ERAP1 and ERAP2), catalytically process these precursor peptides and define the peptide pool that is available for binding onto MHCI (5Weimershaus M. Evnouchidou I. Saveanu L. van Endert P. Peptidases trimming MHC class I ligands.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2013; 25: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ERAP1 gene is also polymorphic, and a variety of coding SNPs confer susceptibility to human disease, most notably chronic inflammatory conditions, often in epistasis with HLA class I alleles, which emphasize the critical role of ERAP1 in antigen presentation (6Strange A.

However, not all the possible combinations of the nine most common coding SNPs (i.e., allotypes) (20Goto Y. Hattori A. Ishii Y. Tsujimoto M. Reduced activity of the hypertension-associated Lys528Arg mutant of human adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (A-LAP)/ER-aminopeptidase-1.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1833-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) occur at equal frequency in the human population (9Ombrello M.J. Kastner D.L. Remmers E.F. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated amino-peptidase 1 and rheumatic disease: Genetics.Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2015; 27: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rather, these SNPs encode a limited palette of allotypes that are maintained at high frequency (>1%) in populations, which suggests functional asymmetry between ERAP1 allotypes. This is supported by the fact that some ERAP1 allotypes are protective, whereas others confer risk to inflammatory diseases (21Alvarez-Navarro C. Lopez de Castro J.A. ERAP1 structure, function and pathogenetic role in ankylosing spondylitis and other MHC-associated diseases.Mol. Immunol. 2014; 57: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A deep understanding of the functional properties of ERAP1 allotypes rather than individual SNPs is critical to unraveling their physiological impact on disease. Previous studies have described several ERAP1 allotypes. Most studies defined ERAP1 allotypes as the combination of nine coding SNPs at amino acid positions 56, 127, 276, 346, 349, 528, 575, 725, and 730. Ombrello et al. (9Ombrello M.J. Kastner D.L.

Reeves et al. reported some additional distinct allotypes discovered in small patient cohorts of AS (n = 72) (15Reeves E. Colebatch-Bourn A. Elliott T. Edwards C.J. James E.

While these studies have contributed to our understanding of the emerging role of ERAP1 allotypes in disease, controversy remains on which ERAP1 allotypes are common, and systematic analysis of their functional differences has been lacking. We used phased genotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project (25Genomes Project C. Auton A. Brooks L.D. Durbin R.M. Garrison E.P. Kang H.M. Korbel J.O. Marchini J.L. McCarthy S. McVean G.A.

A global reference for human genetic variation.Nature. 2015; 526: 68-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6822) Google Scholar) to define common ERAP1 allotypes in 2504 individuals of five major human populations. We generated recombinant versions of the ten most common allotypes and comprehensively characterized their in vitro enzymatic properties. We find a complex landscape of large substrate-dependent enzymatic activity differences between allotypes because of effects on catalytic efficiency and substrate affinity. Our findings suggest that ERAP1 allotypic variation has the potential to strongly synergize with MHCI alleles, in an epitope-dependent manner, to enhance immune system variability in natural human populations. Analysis of the Genome Aggregation Database that contains 125,748 exome sequences (26Karczewski K.J. Francioli L.C. Tiao G. Cummings B.B. Alfoldi J. Wang Q. Collins R.L. Laricchia K.M. Ganna A.

Kastner D.L. Remmers E.F. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated amino-peptidase 1 and rheumatic disease: Genetics.Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2015; 27: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Since however position 12 lies in the signal peptide that is normally excised after translocation of ERAP1 into the ER and thus does not appear in the mature protein, we focused our analysis on the remaining nine positions. These nine SNPs could be theoretically organized in up to 29 discreet allotypes. To define which ERAP1 allotypes are common in human populations, we exploited available phased (i.e., ordered along one chromosome) genotype data from 5q15 of the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 (27Song P. Li W. Xie J. Hou Y. You C. Cytokine storm induced by SARS-CoV-2.Clin. Chim. Acta. 2020; 509: 280-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The frequency of the nine ERAP1 SNPs in different populations is shown in Table S1. Correlations between individual SNPs that indicate linkage disequilibrium are shown in Table S2 and are generally consistent with previous studies (9Ombrello M.J. Kastner D.L. Remmers E.F. Endoplasmic reticulum-associated amino-peptidase 1 and rheumatic disease: Genetics.Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2015; 27: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The population frequency of the most common ERAP1 allotypes is shown in Table 1. An analogous analysis using data from the UK biobank revealed highly similar results (Table S3) (28Sudlow C. Gallacher J. Allen N. Beral V. Burton P. Danesh J. Downey P. Elliott P. Green J. Landray M. Liu B. Matthews P. Ong G. Pell J.

Strikingly, although ten common allotypes constitute 99.9% of all allotypes in the European population, some populations have additional allotypes not reported before. Overall, we were able to identify at least six additional allotypes that have frequencies of over 0.5% in at least one population (Table 1; allotypes 11â16). Our analysis not only confirmed previous results in a larger setting but also revealed that there is significant population variability between ERAP1 allotypes. Regardless, given the extensive use of allotypes 1 to 10 in the literature and their near-complete coverage of the global population (>94% globally, >99.9% in the European population), we proceeded with the functional characterization of these allotypes. Since individuals carry two copies of the ERAP1 gene, we also analyzed the combinations of allotypes present in the 2504 samples (Fig. 1A and Tables S4 and S5). The most common combination was that of allotypes 8 and 2 followed by the 2-2 homozygous, which cumulatively account for almost 20% of the global population. Interestingly, the combination 8-2 was found to be about twice as frequent (11%) than predicted from a random distribution (25.6% Ã 21.8% = 5.6%). We in addition analyzed the prevalence of two SNPs in the homologous ERAP2, namely rs2549782 and rs2248374 (29Evnouchidou I. Birtley J. Seregin S. Papakyriakou A. Zervoudi E. Samiotaki M.

Since however the [G] allele of the rs2248374 leads to no detectable expression of ERAP2 (30Andres A.M. Dennis M.Y. Kretzschmar W.W. Cannons J.L. Lee-Lin S.Q. Hurle B. Program N.C.S.

We have previously shown that the co-occurrence of functional ERAP2 protein is dependent on the ERAP1 haplotype background (10Kuiper J.J.W. Setten J.V. Devall M. Cretu-Stancu M. Hiddingh S.

We calculated the distribution of ERAP1 allotypes in each group of individuals carrying a particular ERAP2 allotype (Table S6), and this revealed some interesting correlations. The [8,8] ERAP1 combination was found in 19.2% of individuals that carry the [A,A] ERAP2 allotype, which is much more frequent compared with the whole population (5.8%). In addition, the [2,2] ERAP1 allotype combination was found in 22.3% of individuals carrying the [B,B] ERAP2 allotype (8.2% in the whole population). The correlation of these specific combinations of ERAP1 and ERAP2 allotypes may be functionally relevant as discussed later in this article.Table 1List of ERAP1 allotypes and their frequency in different populationsAllotypeAmino acid composition at each SNPPopulation allotype frequency (%)56127276346349528575725730ALLAFRAMREUREASSAS1EPIGMKDRQ6.10.512.114.00.07.62ERIGMKDRQ25.628.122.614.442.618.43ERIGMKDRE8.511.45.86.62.714.54ERIGMRDRE3.23.08.91.02.42.45ERIDMRDRE6.28.43.96.30.010.96EPIGMRDRE5.84.010.29.20.76.57KPIGMRDRE7.22.98.54.117.15.08EPMGMRDRE21.817.414.021.528.526.79EPMGMRNRE0.10.00.40.40.00.010EPIGVRNQE9.63.512.422.45.86.5Subtotal94.179.298.899.999.898.511EPIDMRDRE2.79.90.70.10.00.012KPIDMRDRE1.45.20.10.00.00.013EPIGVRNRE0.83.00.10.00.00.014EPMGMRNQE0.41.70.00.00.00.015ERMGMRDRE0.20.50.00.00.10.116EPMGMRDRQ0.120.00.00.00.00.6Subtotal5.620.30.90.10.10.7Total99.799.599.710099.999.2AFR, African; ALL, all populations cumulatively; AMR, American; EAS, East Asian; EUR, European; SAS, South Asian.Bold indicates membership in the ALL population.

To characterize the enzymatic properties of the common ERAP1 allotypes, we generated recombinant ERAP1 variants corresponding to each allotype as listed in Table 1. The SNPs that define allotypes 1 to 10 are scattered throughout the structure of ERAP1, away from the catalytic center (Fig. S1) and can be generally categorized into two groups: (a) SNPs that lie on the outside of the central cavity of the enzyme that normally accommodates the substrate (Fig. S1A) and (b) SNPs that line the interior surface of this cavity and may make direct interactions with the peptide substrate (Fig. S1B). We first characterized the ERAP1 allotypes using well-established small dipeptide substrates. The specific activity for the hydrolysis of the substrate l-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Leu-AMC) is shown in Figure 1B. There was approximately a twofold spread in specific activities for allotypes 1 to 9, but allotype 10 was found to be at least 10-fold less active (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2). The relationship between specific activity and substrate concentration was found to be linear up to 150 Î¼M substrate, which allowed the calculation of the kcat/KM ratio for Leu-AMC (Fig. 1C and Table S7). Allotype 3 was found to be the most active of all, and allotype 10 was 18-fold less active. To obtain full MichaelisâMenten (MM) analysis, we employed the chromogenic dipeptide substrate l-leucine-para-nitroanilide (Leu-pNA) (31Nguyen T.T. Chang S.C. Evnouchidou I. York I.A. Zikos C. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Stratikos E. Stern L.J. Structural basis for antigenic peptide precursor processing by the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase ERAP1.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Data fit best to an allosteric MM model as previously demonstrated (31Nguyen T.T. Chang S.C. Evnouchidou I. York I.A. Zikos C. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Stratikos E. Stern L.J. Structural basis for antigenic peptide precursor processing by the endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase ERAP1.Nat. Struct. Mol.

High-resolution crystal structure of endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 with bound phosphinic transition-state analogue inhibitor.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2019; 10: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) allowing us to calculate the enzymatic parameters (Fig. 1D and Table S7). This analysis demonstrated that the changes in specific activity between allotypes are both because of changes in affinity for the substrate (Khalf) and to changes in maximal catalytic efficiency (Vmax). Similar to Leu-AMC, allotype 10 was much less active in hydrolyzing Leu-pNA, which unfortunately precluded reliable calculation of Khalf and Vmax for this allotype. Since ERAP1 trims long N-terminally extended peptide precursors of antigenic peptides, we turned to more physiologically relevant longer peptides. Recently determined cocrystal structures of ERAP1 with bound 15mer and 10mer peptide analogs revealed that the peptides are processed in a large internal cavity, while making interactions with residues that line that cavity, which can drive selectivity (16Giastas P. Mpakali A. Papakyriakou A. Lelis A. Kokkala P. Neu M. Rowland P. Liddle J. Georgiadis D. Stratikos E. Mechanism for antigenic peptide selection by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2019; 52: 26709-26716Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We measured the rate of N-terminus hydrolysis of two peptides of a similar backbone sequence as the cocrystallized analogs, namely the 15mer LLRIQRGPGRAFVTI and the 10mer LLKHHAFSFK (Fig. 2, A and B). Like the results with the small substrates, we recorded a significant variation in trimming rates. Although allotype 10 was again the least efficient, processing rate differences were less pronounced compared with smaller substrates. Notably, allotype 10 was about as efficient as allotype 9 in trimming the 15mer. Interestingly, the pattern between the two peptides was significantly different. Allotypes 4 and 6 trimmed the 15mer the fastest, whereas allotypes 5 and 7 trimmed the 10mer the fastest. These results are consistent with a complex landscape of peptideâenzyme interactions that drive specificity and suggest that the effect of allotype variation may be substrate dependent (16Giastas P. Mpakali A. Papakyriakou A. Lelis A. Kokkala P. Neu M. Rowland P. Liddle J. Georgiadis D. Stratikos E. Mechanism for antigenic peptide selection by endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1.Proc. Natl.

https://openalex.org/W3131078454,"Tropical reefs are declining rapidly due to climate changes and local stressors such as water quality deterioration and overfishing. The so-called marginal reefs sustain significant coral cover and growth but are dominated by fewer species adapted to suboptimal conditions to most coral species. However, the dynamics of marginal systems may diverge from that of the archetypical oligotrophic tropical reefs, and it is unclear whether they are more or less susceptible to anthropogenic stress. Here, we present the largest (100 fixed quadrats at five reefs) and longest time series (13 years) of benthic cover data for Southwestern Atlantic turbid zone reefs, covering sites under contrasting anthropogenic and oceanographic forcing. Specifically, we addressed how benthic cover changed among habitats and sites, and possible dominance-shift trends. We found less temporal variation in offshore pinnaclesâ tops than on nearshore ones and, conversely, higher temporal fluctuation on offshore pinnaclesâ walls than on nearshore ones. In general, the Abrolhos reefs sustained a stable coral cover and we did not record regional-level dominance shifts favoring other organisms. However, coral decline was evidenced in one reef near a dredging disposal site. Relative abundances of longer-lived reef builders showed a high level of synchrony, which indicates that their dynamics fluctuate under similar drivers. Therefore, changes on those drivers could threaten the stability of these reefs. With the intensification of thermal anomalies and land-based stressors, it is unclear whether the Abrolhos reefs will keep providing key ecosystem services. It is paramount to restrain local stressors that contributed to coral reef deterioration in the last decades, once reversal and restoration tend to become increasingly difficult as coral reefs degrade further and climate changes escalate."
https://openalex.org/W3131360559,"Aggregation of the circulating protein leukocyte-cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) causes amyloidosis of LECT2 (ALECT2), one of the most prevalent forms of systemic amyloidosis affecting the kidney and liver. The I40V mutation is thought to be necessary but not sufficient for ALECT2, with a second, as-yet undetermined condition being required for the disease. EM, X-ray diffraction, NMR, and fluorescence experiments demonstrate that LECT2 forms amyloid fibrils in vitro in the absence of other proteins. Removal of LECT2's single bound Zn2+ appears to be obligatory for fibril formation. Zinc-binding affinity is strongly dependent on pH: 9-13 % of LECT2 is calculated to exist in the zinc-free state over the normal pH range of blood, with this fraction rising to 80 % at pH 6.5. The I40V mutation does not alter zinc-binding affinity or kinetics but destabilizes the zinc-free conformation. These results suggest a mechanism in which loss of zinc together with the I40V mutation leads to ALECT2."
https://openalex.org/W3129577917,"Introduction Visitation to parks and protected areas is a common COVID-19 coping strategy promoted by state and national public health officials and political leadership. Crowding and congestions in parks has been a perennial problem and the ability to socially distance within them is an unproven assumption. Is it possible to socially distance in a busy national park that has been designed to concentrate use? Methodology/Principal findings An observational study was conducted in July 2020 at the outside foyer of the Visitor Center of Arches National Park. Motion sensor cameras were placed to record one-minute videos when a person entered the field of view. Number of groups, group size, facial coverings and encounters within 6 feet (1.83 meters) of other groups were recorded. Groups were smaller on average than recorded in previous studies. Approximately 61% of the visitors wore masks. Most groups (69%) were able to experience the visitor center with no intergroup encounters. We model the probability of intergroup encounters and find as group size and number of groups increases, the probability of encounters rises. With four groups present, the probability of one or more encounters ranges from 19% to 40% for common group sizes, while if eight groups are present, the probability of one or more encounters increases from 34% to 64% for common group sizes. Conclusions/Significance Under conditions in which park visitors have the physical space to avoid close encounters with other groups they are taking advantage of the opportunity. Visitors are minimizing group size, wearing masks, and remaining socially distant. However, encounters increase as the number or the size of the groups increases. In other areas of the parks this ability to avoid encounters may not be as possible. We recommend that park managers continue to appeal for compliance with CDC guidelines, especially the wearing of masks and encouraging visitors to split up into small groups when visiting."

https://openalex.org/W3130855231,"Background Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is assessed by carefully examining a patientâs cognitive impairment. However, previous studies reported inadequate diagnostic accuracy for dementia in primary care settings. Many hospitals use the automated quantitative evaluation method known as the Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimerâs Disease (VSRAD), wherein brain MRI data are used to evaluate brain morphological abnormalities associated with AD. Similarly, an automated quantitative evaluation application called the easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS), which uses brain SPECT data to detect regional cerebral blood flow decreases associated with AD, is widely used. These applications have several indicators, each of which is known to correlate with the degree of AD. However, it is not completely known whether these indicators work better when used in combination in real-world clinical practice. Methods We included 112 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 128 participants with early AD in this study. All participants underwent MRI, SPECT, and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Demographic and clinical characteristics were assessed by univariate analysis, and logistic regression analysis with a combination of MMSE, VSRAD and eZIS indicators was performed to verify whether the diagnostic accuracy in discriminating between MCI and early AD was improved. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the MMSE score alone was 0.835. The AUC was significantly improved to 0.870 by combining the MMSE score with two quantitative indicators from the VSRAD and eZIS that assessed the extent of brain abnormalities. Conclusion Compared with the MMSE score alone, the combination of the MMSE score with the VSRAD and eZIS indicators significantly improves the accuracy of discrimination between patients with MCI and early AD. Implementing VSRAD and eZIS does not require professional clinical experience in the treatment of dementia. Therefore, the accuracy of dementia diagnosis by physicians may easily be improved in real-world primary care settings."
https://openalex.org/W3131530876,"Most of complications after impacted mandibular third molar (iLM3) extraction surgeries are transient and resolved spontaneously within one or two weeks, but some of them are more complicated and required further treatments to alleviate the symptoms. The aim of study is to revisit incidence and predictors of complications after iLM3 surgery by reviewing previous literature and investigating a population-based data. From Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, records of 16,609 patients who had received iLM3 extraction under ambulatory settings were retrieved for analysis. Outcomes of interest included dry socket (DS), prolonged temporomandibular joint symptoms (TMD), and surgical site infection (SSI), which necessitated additional appointments to manage. Odds ratios of having those complications between different variables were analyzed. The incidence rates of DS, TMD, and SSI were 3.6%, 0.41%, 0.17%, respectively; while they ranged from 0.33â19.14% (DS), 0â4.17% (TMD), and 0.2â5.17% (SSI) in previous studies. Logistic regression revealed DS significantly correlated with complexity of odontectomy (2.5-fold of risk) and history of gingivitis or pericoronitis (1.3-fold of risk). More TMD was found in female than male patients (0.5% versus 0.3%). However, no factors associated with SSI was found; neither did we find aging as a risk in association with any of above complications. Compared to previous studies, our data supports that surgical intervention should be considered in iLM3 with risk of gingivitis or pericoronitis to reduce the occurrence of DS. The original information in this article, which provides a âreal-worldâ evidence, along with the organizing data we summarized from previous article, can serve as a reference for clinicians in assessing the complication risks before treatment of iLM3."

https://openalex.org/W3131627730,"Repeated counts of animal abundance can reveal changes in local ecosystem health and inform conservation strategies. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), also known as drones, are commonly used to photograph animals in remote locations; however, counting animals in images is a laborious task. Crowd-sourcing can reduce the time required to conduct these censuses considerably, but must first be validated against expert counts to measure sources of error. Our objectives were to assess the accuracy and precision of citizen science counts and make recommendations for future citizen science projects. We uploaded drone imagery from AÃ±o Nuevo Island (California, USA) to a curated Zooniverse website that instructed citizen scientists to count seals and sea lions. Across 212 days, over 1,500 volunteers counted animals in 90,000 photographs. We quantified the error associated with several descriptive statistics to extract a single citizen science count per photograph from the 15 repeat counts and then compared the resulting citizen science counts to expert counts. Although proportional error was relatively low (9% for sea lions and 5% for seals during the breeding seasons) and improved with repeat sampling, the 12+ volunteers required to reduce error was prohibitively slow, taking on average 6 weeks to estimate animals from a single drone flight covering 25 acres, despite strong public outreach efforts. The single best algorithm was âMedian without the lowest two valuesâ, demonstrating that citizen scientists tended to under-estimate the number of animals present. Citizen scientists accurately counted adult seals, but accuracy was lower when sea lions were present during the summer and could be confused for seals. We underscore the importance of validation efforts and careful project design for researchers hoping to combine citizen science with imagery from drones, occupied aircraft, and/or remote cameras."
https://openalex.org/W3132542769,"Livestock farming plays an important role in supporting the livelihood of resource-poor subsistence farmers in Bhutan. However, ticks and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are one of the major constraints to livestock farming due to their negative effect on health and production. To date, no study has been conducted in Bhutan to assess farmersâ knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) about ticks and TBDs in cattle, although such information is essential in ensuring the development and adoption of effective prevention and control measures. Therefore, a KAP survey was conducted among 246 cattle owners in the Samkhar sub-district of eastern Bhutan in June 2019, using a structured questionnaire. Based on our scoring criteria, 52% [95%CI: 45.5â58.4] had adequate knowledge about ticks as potential vectors of diseases. Logistic regression analysis showed that the individuals who practiced a stall-feeding system of cattle rearing were 2.8 times [OR = 2.8 (95%CI: 1.66â4.78)] more likely to have adequate knowledge than others. Sixty-eight percent [95%CI: 62.5â74.4] had a favorable attitude toward tick prevention and control programs. Men were 1.95 times [OR = 1.95 (95%CI: 1.09â3.55)] more likely to have a favorable attitude than women, and the individuals who practiced a stall-feeding system were 2.59 times [OR = 2.59 95%CI: 1.45â4.78)] more likely to have a favorable attitude than others, after adjusting for the effect of other variables in the model. Overall, only 38% [95%CI 32.5â45] of the respondents reported tick infestation as one of the most important animal health problems, but 100% reported using acaricides to control ticks in cattle. Despite a high level of acaricide usage, the level of knowledge was low among the farmers interviewed. Findings from this study underline the importance of considering identified knowledge gaps and initiating education efforts to improve the adoption of effective tick prevention and control measures among farmers."
https://openalex.org/W3133224977,"The adipocyte hormone leptin regulates glucose homeostasis both centrally and peripherally. A key peripheral target is the pancreatic Î²-cell, which secretes insulin upon glucose stimulation. Leptin is known to suppress glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by promoting trafficking of KATP channels to the Î²-cell surface, which increases K+ conductance and causes Î²-cell hyperpolarization. We have previously shown that leptin-induced KATP channel trafficking requires protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent actin remodeling. However, whether PKA is a downstream effector of leptin signaling or PKA plays a permissive role is unknown. Using FRET-based reporters of PKA activity, we show that leptin increases PKA activity at the cell membrane and that this effect is dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, CaMKKÎ², and AMPK, which are known to be involved in the leptin signaling pathway. Genetic knockdown and rescue experiments reveal that the increased PKA activity upon leptin stimulation requires the membrane-targeted PKA-anchoring protein AKAP79/150, indicating that PKA activated by leptin is anchored to AKAP79/150. Interestingly, disrupting protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) anchoring to AKAP79/150, known to elevate basal PKA signaling, leads to increased surface KATP channels even in the absence of leptin stimulation. Our findings uncover a novel role of AKAP79/150 in coordinating leptin and PKA signaling to regulate KATP channel trafficking in Î²-cells, hence insulin secretion. The study further advances our knowledge of the downstream signaling events that may be targeted to restore insulin secretion regulation in Î²-cells defective in leptin signaling, such as those from obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Pancreatic Î²-cells produce and secrete insulin making them critical for maintaining glucose homeostasis. In order to secrete insulin in a timely and controlled manner, Î²-cells must interpret and respond to a myriad of physiological stimuli and hormones. One such hormone is the adipocyte-derived hormone leptin, which regulates serum insulin levels by suppressing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from Î²-cells (1Seufert J. Kieffer T.J.

This increased surface expression of KATP channels increases the total KATP channel conductance, thereby causing membrane hyperpolarization and reducing Î²-cell electrical activity.

Leptin stimulates Src kinase to phosphorylate and potentiate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) activity, resulting in enhanced Ca2+ influx that activates calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase Î² (CaMKKÎ²), which then phosphorylates and activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Downstream of AMPK actin depolymerization occurs and results in increased trafficking of KATP channels to the plasma membrane (7Chen P.-C. Kryukova Y.N. Shyng S.-L.

We have shown previously that actin remodeling and subsequent KATP channel trafficking following AMPK activation requires protein kinase A (PKA). However, it remains elusive whether PKA functions as an active or permissive player in leptin signaling. PKA is a serine/threonine kinase consisting of two regulatory subunits and two catalytic subunits. Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits causes a conformational change that releases the autoinhibition of the catalytic subunits to activate PKA (11Taylor S.S. Zhang P. Steichen J.M.

Due to the ubiquity of PKA in mammalian cells and the promiscuity of its catalytic subunits, PKA is involved in a multitude of cellular processes. In pancreatic Î²-cells PKA has been identified by several studies as a positive regulator of insulin granule trafficking and exocytosis (13Seino S. Shibasaki T.

However, evidence that PKA promotes KATP channel trafficking suggests that PKA is also involved in signaling events that lead to inhibition of insulin secretion (7Chen P.-C. Kryukova Y.N. Shyng S.-L.

These findings illuminate the complexity of Î²-cell signaling and raise the question of how cellular signaling networks are coordinated to fine-tune insulin secretion. It is well established that PKA interacts with a family of scaffolding proteins termed A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). Different AKAPs direct PKA activity toward specific cell signaling machinery by anchoring PKA and other signaling molecules to distinct subcellular locations (19Wong W. Scott J.D. AKAP signalling complexes: Focal points in space and time.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Several AKAPs have been identified as having roles in regulating insulin secretion, but the mechanisms by which they do so remain poorly understood (20Hinke S.A. Navedo M.F. Ulman A. Whiting J.L.

A novel lipid-anchored A-kinase Anchoring Protein facilitates cAMP-responsive membrane events.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2261-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In this study we show that leptin increases PKA signaling at the Î²-cell membrane, but not in the cytoplasm, through our previously identified pathway involving NMDAR, CaMKKÎ², and AMPK. Moreover, we find that anchoring of PKA by AKAP79/150 is necessary for leptin-mediated KATP channel trafficking and that overexpression of an AKAP79/150 mutant associated with increased basal PKA activity due to a loss of protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B) binding recapitulates the effects of leptin. Additionally, we present evidence that leptin locally increases concentrations of the PKA activator cAMP near AKAP79/150 expressed at the cell membrane. These findings reveal a novel function of the PKA-AKAP79/150 signaling complex for orchestrating leptin signaling to regulate KATP channel surface expression and thus Î²-cell excitability. We have previously shown that leptin promotes trafficking of KATP channels to the plasma membrane, causing increased K+ conductance and cell hyperpolarization in rat insulinoma INS-1 clone 832/13 cells (referred to herein as INS-1 832/13) as well as primary mouse and human Î²-cells (7Chen P.-C.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 2156-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that the ability of leptin to remodel the actin cytoskeleton and increase surface KATP channel density could be blocked by the protein kinase A (PKA)-specific inhibitor peptide (PKI) suggesting that PKA is essential to this signaling mechanism (7Chen P.-C. Kryukova Y.N. Shyng S.-L. Leptin regulates K ATP channel trafficking in pancreatic Î²-cells by a signaling mechanism involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 34098-34109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, whether leptin stimulation directly enhances PKA signaling remains unknown. To determine whether leptin signaling increases PKA signaling, we monitored PKA activity using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based PKA activity reporter A-kinase activity reporter 4 (AKAR4) (30Depry C. Allen M.D. Zhang J. Visualization of PKA activity in plasma membrane microdomains.Mol. Biosyst. 2011; 7: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). AKAR4 contains a PKA substrate motif that is phosphorylated by PKA causing the sensor to undergo a conformational change to increase FRET detected as an increased YFP acceptor/CFP donor emission ratio in response to excitation of the CFP donor. AKAR4 targeted to the plasma membrane with a farnesylation motif (CAAX; Fig. 1A) and AKAR4 targeted to the cytoplasm by a nuclear export signal (NES; Fig. 1B) were both tested. INS-1 832/13 cells expressing either AKAR4-CAAX or AKAR4-NES were treated with leptin (100 nM) or vehicle. In order to control for the expression level of AKAR4 between cells the potent PKA activator forskolin was administered at the end of each experiment and cells that responded robustly to forskolin with a 10â15% increase in FRET were chosen for analysis. For quantification purposes, FRET traces were normalized to the maximal forskolin response (Fig. 1, C and D) and then analyzed for area under the curve (AUC) during the treatment period with vehicle or leptin. In AKAR4-CAAX expressing cells, leptin treatment led to a 6.37-fold increase in PKA activity (p < 0.0005, n = 24) compared with vehicle-treated cells (n = 13) (Fig. 1E). In contrast, AKAR4-NES expressing cells showed no change in PKA activity between vehicle (n = 9) and leptin (n = 10) treatments (Fig. 1F). To confirm that the increase in PKA activity in AKAR4-CAAX expressing cells was due to leptin and not an experimental artifact, we tested the effect of various leptin concentrations compared with inactive boiled leptin. While we found that leptin at concentrations of 10 nM and 100 nM increased PKA activity, boiled 100 nM leptin did not (Fig. 1G). This result indicates that leptin does indeed increase PKA activity, as reported by AKAR4-CAAX, and that this increase is spatially restricted to the plasma membrane. Next, we sought to determine the signaling mechanism that underlies an increase in PKA activity. Our previous studies have shown that the leptin signaling pathway leading to increased KATP channel trafficking involves potentiation of NMDAR activity and Ca2+ influx to activate CaMKKÎ²; this results in phosphorylation and activation of AMPK, which is followed by PKA-dependent actin depolymerization (7Chen P.-C. Kryukova Y.N. Shyng S.-L. Leptin regulates K ATP channel trafficking in pancreatic Î²-cells by a signaling mechanism involving AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).J. Biol.

Chem. 2020; 295: 17281-17297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, a logical hypothesis is that leptin upregulates PKA activity via the NMDAR-CaMKKÎ²-AMPK signaling axis. To test this, we implemented the membrane-targeted PKA activity sensor AKAR4-CAAX in conjunction with pharmacological reagents. As shown in Figure 2A, inhibiting the initial potentiation of NMDARs with the competitive NMDAR antagonist D-APV (50 Î¼M) or preventing the ensuing Ca2+ influx with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA (10 mM) reduced leptin enhancement of PKA activity by 2.5-fold (n = 12) and 5-fold (n = 11), respectively, levels that were not significantly different from the vehicle control. Consistent with these findings, inhibiting CaMKKÎ² with STO-609 (1 Î¼M) also prevented leptin from increasing PKA activity (n = 9). Finally, the role of AMPK for leptin activation of PKA was tested using Compound C (CC, also known as Dorsomorphin, 1 Î¼M). Blocking AMPK activity with CC (n = 15) greatly diminished the effect of leptin such that PKA activity levels resembled those of vehicle-treated cells. These results support the notion that PKA is activated downstream of AMPK in the leptin signaling cascade. To further corroborate the above findings, we tested whether pharmacological activation of NMDAR or AMPK could increase PKA activity. Treating AKAR4-CAAX expressing cells with the NMDAR coagonists NMDA (100 Î¼M) and glycine (100 Î¼M) or the AMPK agonist AICAR (500 Î¼M) significantly increased FRET (Fig. 2B). While direct activation of AMPK caused a 6.25-fold increase (p < 0.001, n = 20) over vehicle that was equivalent to leptin treatment, NMDAR coagonists caused a 10.66-fold increase (p < 0.001, n = 11) compared with vehicle, which was 1.67 times (p < 0.01, n = 11) greater than that of leptin. This suggests that the direct activation of NMDARs may have caused a greater extent of NMDAR activity and consequently more PKA activity. To confirm that NMDARs signal through the leptin pathway involving AMPK, we treated cells with the NMDAR coagonists NMDA and glycine in the presence of the AMPK inhibitor CC (1 Î¼M) and found that CC significantly reduced the effect of NMDAR activation on PKA activity (n = 10, p < 0.001) (Fig. 2C). On the contrary, the effects of the AMPK agonist AICAR were not blocked by the NMDAR inhibitor D-APV (50 Î¼M) indicating that NMDAR lies upstream of AMPK. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that leptin signaling through the NMDAR-CaMKKÎ²-AMPK cascade increases PKA activity. During the live cell PKA activity imaging experiments, it was apparent that leptin increased PKA activity at the cell membrane but not throughout the cytoplasm. This suggests that leptin acts on a subset of cellular PKA that is localized near the plasma membrane. It is widely documented that a high level of regulation and specificity of PKA signaling is maintained by a family of scaffolding proteins known as A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs), which target PKA and its signaling partners to distinct subcellular regions, thereby creating PKA signaling microdomains and nanodomains (19Wong W.

To test if AKAPs are involved in targeting PKA to the cell membrane for leptin signaling, we used the PKAâAKAP interaction disruptor peptide st-Ht31 (50 Î¼M) (33Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. Association of the type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase with a human thyroid RII-anchoring protein. Cloning and characterization of the RII-binding domain.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide binds the regulatory subunits of PKA and prevents PKA from binding AKAPs. We first introduced st-Ht31 to INS-1 832/13 cells expressing AKAR4-CAAX and monitored PKA activity in response to various stimuli (Fig. 3A). Disrupting the PKAâAKAP interaction with st-Ht31 led to a significant decrease in PKA activity by leptin (3.6-fold decrease, p < 0.01), NMDAR agonists NMDA and glycine (6.4-fold decrease, p < 0.001, n = 8), and AMPK activator AICAR (3.4-fold decrease, p < 0.01, n = 10). These experiments showed that increased PKA activity at the cell membrane by leptin signaling requires AKAPs. Having established that PKAâAKAP interactions are necessary for leptin-mediated PKA activity, we wanted to determine if such an interaction is essential for downstream KATP channel trafficking. To visualize KATP channels at the plasma membrane, INS-1 832/13 cells were transduced with recombinant adenoviruses containing the KATP channel subunits Kir6.2 and SUR1 tagged with an N-terminus extracellular bungarotoxin-binding motif (BTX-SUR1) (7Chen P.-C.

Leptin (10 nM) treated cells showed a marked increase in surface BTX staining of BTX-SUR1 compared with vehicle-treated cells as expected (Fig. 3B) (7Chen P.-C. Kryukova Y.N. Shyng S.-L.

However, this effect of leptin was greatly attenuated by the presence of st-Ht31 indicating that blocking PKA from binding AKAPs prohibits leptin from increasing KATP channel surface density.

https://openalex.org/W3133347588,"Wetland restoration provides remarkable opportunities to understand vegetation dynamics and to inform success of future projects through rigorous restoration experiments. Salt marsh restoration typically focuses on physical factors such as sediment dynamics and elevation. Despite many demonstrations of strong top-down effects on salt marshes, the potential for consumers to affect salt marsh restoration projects has rarely been quantified. Recently, major restoration projects at the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve in central California, USA provided an opportunity to examine how herbivory influences restoration success. We quantified the strength of consumer effects by comparing caged to uncaged plantings, and compared effects among plant species and sites. We used camera traps to detect which herbivores were most common and how their abundance varied spatially. Beyond characterizing consumer effects, we also tested management strategies for reducing negative effects of herbivory at the restoration sites, including caging, mowing, and acoustic playbacks of predator sounds. We found extremely strong consumer effects at sites with extensive stands of exotic forbs upland of the high marsh; uncaged restoration plants suffered heavy herbivory and high mortality, while most caged plants survived. Brush rabbits ( Sylvilagus bachmani ) were by far the most frequent consumers of these high marsh plants. Our work thus provides the first evidence of mammal consumers affecting salt marsh restoration success. Mowing of tall exotic forb cover adjacent to the marsh at one restoration site greatly reduced consumption, and nearly all monitored plantings survived at a second restoration site where construction had temporarily eliminated upland cover. Playbacks of predator sounds did not significantly affect restoration plantings, but restoration efforts in marsh communities vulnerable to terrestrial herbivory may benefit from concurrent restoration of predator communities in the upland habitats surrounding the marsh. A landscape approach is thus critical for recognizing linkages between terrestrial and marine vegetation."
https://openalex.org/W3129906851,"Purpose To evaluate the visual outcomes of vitrectomy for lamellar macular hole (LMH) and epiretinal membrane (ERM) foveoschisis and to investigate the prognostic factor for postoperative visual acuity. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 15 LMH and 17 ERM foveoschisis eyes that had undergone a standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy with (12 eyes) or without (20 eyes) cataract surgery. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at postoperative three months and the final visit were compared to the preoperative measurements. We investigated the relationship between BCVA at the final visit and baseline parameters (age, preoperative BCVA, the presence of epiretinal proliferation [EP] and ellipsoid zone [EZ] disruption). The best explanatory variables for the final BCVA were investigated using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) model selection. Results The mean age was 67.2 years. The mean follow-up duration was 30.7 months. Fifteen of 32 examined eyes were diagnosed as LMH and 17 eyes as ERM foveoschisis. Twelve eyes in LMH had EP and 13 eyes showed the disruption of EZ integrity. In total, BCVA significantly improved at 3 months postoperatively (p = 0.0013). A significant improvement was observed in ERM foveoschisis (p = 0.0085) but not in LMH group (p = 0.071). Comparing the BCVA between the baseline and the final visit, significant improvements were observed in total, ERM foveoschisis and LMH group (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001 and p = 0.026, respectively). The optimal model for BCVA at the final visit included preoperative BCVA and the presence of EZ disruption (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). Conclusion Our results suggested that the final BCVA was dependent on preoperative BCVA and the presence of EZ disruption. Surgical indications might be warranted for LMHs with EZ disruption."
https://openalex.org/W3130289473,"Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a source of morbidity in individuals with restricted mobility including individuals that are obese or diabetic. Infection of PUs with pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), impairs ulcers from healing. The present study evaluated ebselen as a topical antibacterial to treat MRSA-infected PUs. Against two different S . aureus strains, including MRSA USA300, resistance to ebselen did not emerge after 14 consecutive passages. Resistance to mupirocin emerged after only five passages. Additionally, ebselen was found to exert a modest postantibiotic effect of five hours against two MRSA strains. Ebselen was subsequently evaluated in MRSA-infected PUs in two models using obese and diabetic mice. In obese mice, topical ebselen (89.2% reduction) and oral linezolid (84.5% reduction) similarly reduced the burden of MRSA in infected PUs. However, in diabetic mice, topical ebselen (45.8% reduction in MRSA burden) was less effective. Histopathological evaluation of ulcers in diabetic mice determined that ebselen treatment resulted in fewer bacterial colonies deep within the dermis and that the treatment exhibited evidence of epithelial regeneration. Topical mupirocin was superior to ebselen in reducing MRSA burden in infected PUs both in obese (98.7% reduction) and diabetic (99.3% reduction) mice. Ebselenâs antibacterial activity was negatively impacted as the bacterial inoculum was increased from 10 5 CFU/mL to 10 7 CFU/mL. These results suggest that a higher dose of ebselen, or a longer course of treatment, may be needed to achieve a similar effect as mupirocin in topically treating MRSA-infected pressure ulcers."
https://openalex.org/W3130675900,"Honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) play a significant role in the pollination of various food crops and plants. In the past decades, honeybee management has been challenged with increased pathogen and environmental pressure associating with increased beekeeping costs, having a marked economic impact on the beekeeping industry. Pathogens have been identified as a contributing cause of colony losses. Evidence suggested a possible route of pathogen transmission among bees via oral-oral contacts through trophallaxis. Here we propose a model that describes the transmission of an infection within a colony when bee members engage in the trophallactic activity to distribute nectar. In addition, we examine two important features of social immunity, defined as collective disease defenses organized by honeybee society. First, our model considers the social segregation of worker bees. The segregation limits foragers, which are highly exposed to pathogens during foraging outside the nest, from interacting with bees residing in the inner parts of the nest. Second, our model includes a hygienic response, by which healthy nurse bees exterminate infected bees to mitigate horizontal transmission of the infection to other bee members. We propose that the social segregation forms the first line of defense in reducing the uptake of pathogens into the colony. If the first line of defense fails, the hygienic behavior provides a second mechanism in preventing disease spread. Our study identifies the rate of egg-laying as a critical factor in maintaining the colonyâs health against an infection. We propose that winter conditions which cease or reduce the egg-laying activity combined with an infection in early spring can compromise the social immunity defenses and potentially cause colony losses."
https://openalex.org/W3130835319,"Objective We assessed the association of suPAR (soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor) plasma levels with fibrotic and vascular manifestations in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc). Methods suPAR plasma levels were measured in 121 consecutive patients with SSc and correlated to pulmonary and vascular features of SSc, including interstitial lung disease as characterized by percentage of predicted CO diffusing capacity (DLco) and forced vital capacity (FVC), pulmonary fibrosis by computed tomography, and pulmonary arterial hypertension, telangiectasias, and digital ulcers. Results Overall, 121 SSc patients (84% females; mean age, 57 Â± 12 [range: 22â79] years) were enrolled; 35% had diffuse cutaneous SSc. suPAR plasma levels ranged from 1.3â10.2 [median: 2.9 (p25âp75: 2.3â3.9)] ng/mL. Log(suPAR) levels correlated with DLco (r = -0.41, p &lt;0.0001) and FVC (r = -0.26, p = 0.004), also when adjusted for age, sex, and pulmonary hypertension. A suPAR cut-off level of &gt;2.5 ng/mL showed a sensitivity of 91% for identifying patients with either DLco &lt;50% or FVC &lt; 60% of the predicted values. Similarly, 19 (90%) had a suPAR &gt;2.5 ng/mL among those diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis vs. 59 (60%) among those who did not ( p = 0.008). suPAR values were not associated with vascular manifestations. Conclusion suPAR levels strongly correlated with pulmonary involvement in SSc. Future studies should test if suPAR estimation can be used for surveillance of severe pulmonary involvement in SSc."

One example is tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterases (TDP), which are enzymes capable of breaking down the covalent bond between DNA and DNA topoisomerases (27Zhang H. Xiong Y. Chen J. DNAâprotein cross-link repair: What do we know now?.Cell Biosci. 2020; 10: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The activity of these enzymes is limited by substrate accessibility, suggesting that the adduct needs first to be hydrolyzed to a peptide (28KÃ¼hbacher U. Duxin J.P.

Ubiquitination is a key step for proteolysis by the nuclear DNA-dependent metalloprotease SPRTN (18Larsen N.B. Gao A.O. Sparks J.L. Gallina I. Wu R.A. Mann M. RÃ¤schle M. Walter J.C. Duxin J.P.

SPRTN uses an accessory process (i.e., ubiquitination) to repair cross-links because the ubiquitin controls its activity (34Zhao S. Kieser A. Li H.-Y. Reinking H.K. Weickert P. Euteneuer S. Yaneva D.

A ubiquitin switch controls autocatalytic inactivation of the DNAâprotein crosslink repair protease SPRTN.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 49: 902-915Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). SPRTN-mediated proteolysis also depends on the location of protein cross-links on the DNA strands (30Reinking H.K. Kang H.-S. GÃ¶tz M.J. Li H.-Y. Kieser A. Zhao S. Acampora A.C. Weickert P.

FAM111A is also known to act on DNAâprotein cross-links and contains a trypsin-like domain (35Kojima Y. Machida Y. Palani S. Caulfield T.R. Radisky E.S. Kaufmann S.H. Machida Y.J. FAM111A protects replication forks from protein obstacles via its trypsin-like domain.Nat. Commun. 2020; 111318Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Repair mechanisms can target different components of a DNAâprotein cross-link (i.e., the DNA molecule, the cross-link bond, or protein) and may depend on the stage of the cell cycle (27Zhang H.

Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Most DNAâprotein cross-links are too large for DNA polymerase bypass (37Yudkina A.V. Dvornikova A.P. Zharkov D.O. Variable termination sites of DNA polymerases encountering a DNA-protein cross-link.PLoS One. 2018; 13e0198480Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and proteases are believed to cleave the proteins to smaller peptides that can be repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) (38Chesner L.N.

An overview of Y-Family DNA polymerases and a case study of human DNA polymerase Î·.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 2793-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).

An overview of Y-Family DNA polymerases and a case study of human DNA polymerase Î·.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 2793-2803Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Only in a few cases has the mutagenic potential of a DNAâpeptide cross-link been analyzed (42Naldiga S. Ji S. Thomforde J. Nicolae C.M. Lee M. Zhang Z. Moldovan G.-L. Tretyakova N.Y. Basu A.K.

O6-Alkylguanine DNA-alkyltransferase (AGT, or MGMT), a â¼22 kDa protein, is a crucial repair system for protection from alkylating agents (43Ghodke P.P. Albertolle M.E. Johnson K.M. Guengerich F.P.

Ethylene dibromide (EDB, or 1,2-dibromoethane) is a known carcinogen that had formerly been used as a gasoline additive, soil fumigant, and pesticide (44Huff J.E. 1,2-Dibromoethane (ethylene dibromide).Environ.

Overexpression of AGT paradoxically increased EDB toxicity and the incidence of base pair mutations in bacterial and mammalian cells (48Liu L. Pegg A.E. Williams K.M. Guengerich F.P.

Alkyltransferase-mediated toxicity of bis-electrophiles in mammalian cells.Mutat. Res. 2010; 684: 35Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cys-145 of AGT reacts with EDB via a nucleophilic substitution that results in a half-mustard intermediate, which cyclizes to form an unstable episulfonium ion that can form a covalent bond with DNA (Fig. 1). The AGT-EDB episulfonium ion can react with nucleobases at different positions, including the N7, N2, N1, and O6 atoms of dG and the N6 atom of dA (50Chowdhury G. Cho S.-H. Pegg A.E. Guengerich F.P.

EDB is also known to cross-link DNA with the tripeptide glutathione (GSH) in a similar mechanism (52Sedgeman C.A. Su Y. Guengerich F.P.

Thus, this DNAâprotein cross-link is directly relevant to a practical problem in toxicology, and other 1,2-dihaloalkanes and other bis-functional electrophiles are also relevant (53Valadez J.G.

We developed a procedure for the synthesis and characterization of a DNAâpeptide cross-link at the N6 position of dA with a 15-mer peptide from the active site of AGT in order to investigate its effect on DNA replication by TLS polymerases. Full-length extension and single nucleotide insertion assays, steady-state kinetics, and LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis were performed to determine the efficiency and fidelity at the N6-dA-adducted peptide. A 15-mer peptide cross-linked to an oligonucleotide (N6-dA) was synthesized using the 15-mer peptide (acyl-PVPILIPCHRVVSSS-amide, AGT residues 138â152, with Cys-150 changed to Ser to permit exclusive modification at Cys-145) and a 6-chloropurine-containing oligonucleotide as outlined in Figure 2 (Scheme S1âS2, See Table S1 for oligonucleotide sequences). The peptide was treated with O-(mesitylsulfonyl)hydroxylamine (MSH), yielding amination of the cysteine to produce a dehydroalanine (dha) residue in its place (Scheme S1). The dha peptide was purified by HPLC (Fig. S1) and characterized by positive ESI-MS/MS (Figs. S2 and S3; Table S2). The 6-chloropurine-containing oligonucleotide was subjected to nucleophilic substitution with cystamine (Scheme S2), and the cystamine-containing oligonucleotide was purified by HPLC (Fig. S4) and characterized by MALDI MS (Fig. S5). Reduction of the cystamine-containing oligonucleotide with DTT yielded N6-(2-thioethyl)dA in the oligonucleotide, used for the next step without any purification (Fig. 2). Finally, the dha peptide was coupled with the thiol-containing oligonucleotide to obtain a 15-mer peptide cross-linked at the N6 position of dA via a two-carbon linker (Fig. 2). Alternatively, the 15-mer peptide cross-linked to DNA was also synthesized by a previously reported method (55Chandrasekar J. Wylder A.C. Silverman S.K. Phosphoserine lyase deoxyribozymes: DNA-catalyzed formation of dehydroalanine residues in peptides.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015; 137: 9575-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The DNAâpeptide cross-link was purified by gel electrophoresis (Fig. S6) and characterized by MALDI MS as well as ESI-MS (Figs. 3 and S7). This structure is analogous to the AGT-DNA cross-link induced by EDB (50Chowdhury G. Cho S.-H. Pegg A.E. Guengerich F.P. Detection and characterization of ethylene dibromide-derived DNA-crosslinks formed with O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2013; 52: 12879-12882Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but an oxidized sulfur-bearing adduct was observed with an additional mass of 32 a. m. u. (Figs. 2, 3, and S7) which was characterized using LC-MS/MS analysis. The DNA moiety was hydrolyzed with HF to obtain a peptide adducted with adenine (Fig. S8). In mass spectral analysis (positive mode), two major m/z ions were observed, m/z 613.66 (+3) and 919.99 (+2) (Fig. S9), indicative of an oxidized sulfur atom, which was further confirmed from the fragmentation pattern (Fig. S10 and Table S3). Full-length extension and single nucleotide insertion assays were carried out with TLS polymerases. Full-length primer extension reactions (ârunning startâ) were performed in the presence of all four dNTPs using a 12-mer primer (Fig. 4A). The N6-dA-peptide lesion in the template affected each polymerase differently. With the DNAâpeptide cross-link, hPol Î· fully extended the primer with almost similar efficiency as the unmodified template (Fig. 4B, lanes 2â6 and 8â12). hPol Î¹ mainly produced a single nucleotide incorporation product (Fig. 4C, lanes 20â24), similar to the unmodified template.

To date, three proteasomal receptors have been identified, as well as multiple shuttle proteins and numerous types of polyUb chains that signal for degradation. While the components of this pathway are well-known, our understanding of their interplay is unclearâespecially in the context of Rpn1, the largest proteasomal subunit. Here, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with competition assays, we show that Rpn1 associates with UBL-containing proteins and polyUb chains, while exhibiting a preference for shuttle protein Rad23. Rpn1 appears to contain multiple Ub/UBL-binding sites, theoretically as many as one for each of its hallmark proteasome/cyclosome repeats. Remarkably, we also find that binding sites on Rpn1 can be shared among Ub and UBL species, while proteasomal receptors Rpn1 and Rpn10 can compete with each other for binding of shuttle protein Dsk2. Taken together, our results rule out the possibility of exclusive recognition sites on Rpn1 for individual Ub/UBL signals and further emphasize the complexity of the redundancy-laden proteasomal degradation pathway.

The ubiquitinâproteasome system (UPS) is the primary pathway for regulated protein turnover in eukaryotes (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev.

Specific polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains are conjugated to substrates through an ATP-dependent enzymatic cascade and subsequently recognized by the 26S proteasome, which then degrades the substrate. These steps are implemented in conjunction with a myriad of nuanced regulatory features (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev.

The 26S proteasome is a 2.5 MDa molecular machine that is clustered into two multisubunit complexes: the 19S regulatory particle (RP) and the 20S core particle (CP), present in a 2:1 stoichiometry. The RP is responsible for substrate recognition and translocation into the cylindrical CP, which contains six proteolytic sites. Three RP subunits function as polyUb receptors: Rpn1/PSMD2 (5Shi Y.

Although the UPS is the subject of intense research efforts, the apparent redundancy surrounding substrate delivery (polyUb, UBL-UBA shuttle proteins) and recognition (Rpn1, Rpn10, Rpn13) has not been clarified. While the proteasome itself is essential to cells, deletion of only one receptor or UBL-UBA shuttle protein is not lethal (5Shi Y. Chen X. Elsasser S. Stocks B.B. Tian G. Lee B.H.

Moreover, a significant proportion of active proteasomes do not contain Rpn10 or Rpn13, thereby demonstrating the redundant nature of UPS-mediated proteolysis (26Bohn S. Beck F. Sakata E.

Commun. 2020; 11: 477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), thereby suggesting the presence of at least one additional unidentified recognition site. Furthermore, pull-down assays have shown that Rpn1 may be able to bind the UBL domains of Rad23 and Dsk2 simultaneously (17Rosenzweig R. Bronner V. Zhang D. Fushman D. Glickman M.H.

Here, we confirmed the physical association between Rad23, Dsk2, Ubp6, and Rpn1, both with full-length constructs and with individual domains. Intriguingly, our NMR experiments did indeed suggest the presence of more than one binding site on Rpn1. Moreover, competition studies demonstrated the multiplicity of signal recognition by Rpn1, clearly showing that Rad23, Dsk2, Ubp6, K48-linked polyUb, and K11-linked polyUb all associate with the same binding site(s) on Rpn1. These findings provide further evidence of the redundancy within the UPS and may suggest that it is actually a desirable feature. The affinities of several UBL domains have been previously examined by SPR for full-length Rpn1 (Rpn1FL) and by NMR or ITC for some short Rpn1 constructs (5Shi Y. Chen X. Elsasser S. Stocks B.B.

These values will be referred to explicitly throughout the text. Here, we investigate two important questions in the context of signal recognition by Rpn1: (1) Does Rpn1 possess multiple UBL recognition sites, as suggested by recent findings (27Martinez-Fonts K. Davis C. Tomita T. Elsasser S. Nager A.R. Shi Y. Finley D. Matouschek A. The proteasome 19S cap and its ubiquitin receptors provide a versatile recognition platform for substrates.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)? (2) If so, is there an exclusive site for each proteasomal signal, or are the sites shared among all signals or only among some signals? We first confirmed the interaction between Rpn1FL and each of the full-length UBL-UBA proteins, as well as Ubp6. Substantial signal attenuations were observed in the NMR spectra of 15N-enriched Dsk2, Rad23, and Ubp6 after adding an equimolar amount of unlabeled Rpn1FL (Fig. S1). Notably, the signals that disappeared predominantly corresponded to residues in the respective UBL domains, thereby supporting previous observations (5Shi Y. Chen X. Elsasser S. Stocks B.B. Tian G.

Attenuation of NMR signals upon binding is generally the consequence of (1) slower overall molecular tumbling due to increased size of the resulting complex; and/or (2) local fluctuations (called chemical exchange) in the electronic environment of the observed nucleus that accompany the association/dissociation events. The latter may cause severe signal broadening and disappearance when the exchange rate is on the order of the resonance frequency difference for a given nucleus in the exchanging states (28Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Rance M. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego2006Google Scholar). This so-called intermediate exchange regime is usually observed for a limited subset of residues at or near the binding interface, with fluctuations typically on the submillisecondâmillisecond timescale. When the chemical exchange rate is much slower than the resonance frequency difference, the slow exchange regime is observed, wherein disappearance of NMR signals corresponding to the unbound state is accompanied by the emergence of NMR signals corresponding to the bound state (29Nawatha M. Rogers J.M. Bonn S.M. Livneh I. Lemma B. Mali S.M. Vamisetti G.B. Sun H. Bercovich B. Huang Y. Ciechanover A. Fushman D. Suga H. Brik A. De novo macrocyclic peptides that specifically modulate Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains.Nat. Chem. 2019; 11: 644-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Unlike intermediate or slow chemical exchange, a substantial increase in molecular size upon binding produces widespread signal broadening across all residues located in structured regions of the protein. The severity of this broadening depends on the size of the complex, the fraction of time each protein molecule spends in the bound state, and the fraction of protein molecules that come into contact with the ligand during the NMR measurement time (typically 100â150 ms); the former two variables determine the apparent signal linewidths. If the exchange between free and bound states happens rapidly during NMR experimentation, it is likely that most protein molecules will exhibit size-related signal broadening. However, if the dissociation rate is slow, such that the residence time in the bound state is longer than the NMR measurement time, then the fraction of protein molecules affected by this broadening will be limited by the stoichiometry of binding and the number of ligand molecules in solution. In the case when dissociation is slow and the protein concentration exceeds the concentration of available binding sites on the ligands, the excess protein molecules will not sample the bound state during the NMR measurement time, and their signals will remain visible. It is possible that both of the aforementioned causes of signal broadening contributed to the disappearance of NMR signals in the presence of Rpn1FL. However, because this was a widespread effect across entire UBL domains (Figs. S2 and S3), we conclude that size-related signal broadening was the predominant factor. The molecular weight of Rpn1 complexes with the aforementioned moieties is expected to be at least â¼150 kDa for the full-length proteins and â¼120 kDa for the UBL"
https://openalex.org/W3133328879,"Many studies have documented the abnormal concentrations of metals/metalloids in serum or urine of occupational workers, but no works systematically analysed the concentrations of elements in serum or urine of indium-exposed workers. This study was aimed to assess 28 elements in serum and urine from 57 individuals with occupational exposure to indium and its compounds. Control subjects were 63 workers without metal exposure. We collected information on occupation and lifestyle habits by questionnaire. Biological samples were collected to quantify elements by inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometer. Air in the breathing zones was drawn at flow rates of 1.5â3 L/min for a sampling period of 6 to 8 h, using a Model BFC-35 pump. The average ambient indium level was 0.078 mg/m 3 . Serum/urine Indium levels were significantly higher in indium-exposed workers than in controls ( P &lt; 0.01). Moreover, serum/urine indium concentrations in the group with 6â14 years and â¥15 years of employment were significantly higher than those with â¤5 employment years( P &lt; 0.05). Ten of the other 27 elements/metals measured were higher in serum/urine in indium-exposed workers compared to the controls (aluminum, beryllium, cadmium, cesium, chromium, lithium, manganese, magnesium, molybdenum and vanadium). Zinc levels in serum/urine were significantly decreased in the indium-exposed workers. Additionally, other elements/metals were higher in one specimen (serum or urine) but lower in the other (Selenium was lower in serum but higher in urine in the indium-exposed workers compared with the controls; likewise Thallium and Rubidium were higher in serum but lower in urine). Linear regression analyses, revealed significant correlations between serum and urine for indium, aluminum, arsenic, barium, cadmium, cesium, cobalt, selenium, silver, and zinc ( P &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that occupational exposure to indium and its compounds may disturb the homeostasis of trace elements in systemic circulation, indium concentrations in serum or urine appear reflective of workersâ exposure to ambient indium and their years of working, respectively. The serum/urine levels of essential metals are modified by exposure to indium in occupationally exposed workers. Further studies including larger sample size and more kinds of biological sample are needed to validate our findings."

In particular, a standardized fraction from sweet chestnut ( Castanea sativa Mill.) wood by-products and a commercial green tea ( Camellia sinensis L.) leaf extract were tested at different concentrations (0.1â5.0% and 0.2% w/v respectively). The Sweet Chestnut Wood fraction was produced in an industrial plant through an environmentally and economically sustainable process, involving hot-water extraction and a sequence of membrane filtration steps with different molecular cut-offs for fractionation and concentration of the active principles. The Sweet Chestnut Wood and Green Tea Leaf extracts were characterised via HPLC/DAD/MS quali-quantitative analysis. The first extract showed a polyphenolic content of 20.5% w/w, 100% hydrolysable tannins; the second one showed a polyphenolic content of 87.5% w/w, of which 96.2% epigallocatechin gallate and 3.8% epicatechin gallate. The antifungal activity of the Sweet Chestnut fraction in aqueous solutions was evaluated towards different filamentous fungi, in particular telluric phytopathogens ( Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici ; Fusarium solani ; Rhizoctonia solani ; Sclerotium rolfsii ) and post harvest pathogens ( Botrytis cinerea , that can also attack field plants; Penicillium digitatum ; Penicillium italicum ), and compared to the activity of Green Tea Leaf extract solutions. The experimental results evidenced, for almost all tested fungi, inhibition of the mycelial growth rate in presence of tannins. The lowest inhibitions were observed for B . cinerea (7.5%, to 28.9%) and P . italicum (53.8% in 5.0% w/v Sweet Chestnut extract substrate).

However, the mechanism by which these fats promote cartilage degradation and the development of OA is not clearly understood. Here, we report the effects of consumption of common dietary saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, palmitate and oleate, respectively, on body weight, metabolic factors, and knee articular cartilage in a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Mice fed on a diet rich in saturated or unsaturated fatty acid gained an equal amount of weight; however, mice fed a palmitate diet, but not a control or oleate diet, exhibited more cartilage lesions and increased expression of 1) unfolded protein response (UPR)/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers including BIP, P-IRE1Î±, XBP1, ATF4, and CHOP; 2) apoptosis markers CC3 and C-PARP; and 3) negative cell survival regulators Nupr1 and TRB3, in knee articular cartilage. Palmitate-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL staining. Likewise, dietary palmitate was also increased the circulatory levels of classic proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-Î±. Taken together, our results demonstrate that increased weight gain is not sufficient for the development of obesity-linked OA and suggest that dietary palmitate promotes UPR/ER stress and cartilage lesions in mouse knee joints. This study validates our previous in vitro findings and suggests that ER stress could be the critical metabolic factor contributing to the development of diet/obesity induced OA."
https://openalex.org/W3133322534,"Background/Purpose Muscular reflex responses of the lower extremities to sudden gait disturbances are related to postural stability and injury risk. Chronic ankle instability (CAI) has shown to affect activities related to the distal leg muscles while walking. Its effects on proximal muscle activities of the leg, both for the injured- (IN) and uninjured-side (NON), remain unclear. Therefore, the aim was to compare the difference of the motor control strategy in ipsilateral and contralateral proximal joints while unperturbed walking and perturbed walking between individuals with CAI and matched controls. Materials and methods In a cross-sectional study, 13 participants with unilateral CAI and 13 controls (CON) walked on a split-belt treadmill with and without random left- and right-sided perturbations. EMG amplitudes of muscles at lower extremities were analyzed 200 ms after perturbations, 200 ms before, and 100 ms after (Post100) heel contact while walking. Onset latencies were analyzed at heel contacts and after perturbations. Statistical significance was set at alphaâ¤ 0.05 and 95% confidence intervals were applied to determine group differences. Cohenâs d effect sizes were calculated to evaluate the extent of differences. Results Participants with CAI showed increased EMG amplitudes for NON-rectus abdominus at Post100 and shorter latencies for IN-gluteus maximus after heel contact compared to CON ( p &lt;0.05). Overall, leg muscles (rectus femoris, biceps femoris, and gluteus medius) activated earlier and less bilaterally ( d = 0.30â0.88) and trunk muscles (bilateral rectus abdominus and NON-erector spinae) activated earlier and more for the CAI group than CON group ( d = 0.33â1.09). Conclusion Unilateral CAI alters the pattern of the motor control strategy around proximal joints bilaterally. Neuromuscular training for the muscles, which alters motor control strategy because of CAI, could be taken into consideration when planning rehabilitation for CAI."

Not only may these injuries cause physical damage and disability, they may also cause mental disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate if persons with an electrical injury suffer from mental disorders in the following years. Material and methods In a prospective matched cohort design, we identified 14.112 electrical injuries in two Danish registries and matched these with persons with dislocation/sprain injuries or eye injuries, respectively, as well as with persons from the workforce from the same occupation, using year of injury, sex and age as matching variables. We identified possible outcomes in terms of mental diagnoses in the Danish National Patient registry, based on literature, including reviews, original studies and case-reports as well as experiences from clinical praxis. The associations were analyzed using conditional cox- and logistic regression. Results We found that the following of the examined outcomes were associated with exposure to an electrical injury compared to the matched controls. Some of the outcomes showed the strongest associations shortly after the injury, namely âmental disorders due to known physiological conditionâ, âanxiety and adjustment disordersâ, and especially the âPost Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)â subgroup. The same pattern was seen for âDepressionâ although the associations were weaker. Other conditions took time to develop (âSomatoform disordersâ), or were only present in the time to event analysis (âother non-psychotic mental disordersâ and âsleep disordersâ). The findings were consistent in all three matches, with the highest risk estimates in the occupation match. Conclusion Electrical injuries may result in mental disorders, both acute and several years after. However, the absolute risk is limited as most of the outcomes are rare."
https://openalex.org/W3129405403,"As an important transportation, the belt conveyor has been widely used and researched. It is urgent to solve the problem of energy saving and consumption reduction of belt conveyor. Aiming at reducing high energy consumption in the rated-speed operation of a belt conveyor, the present paper establishes an energy-saving belt-speed model of a belt conveyor using a polynomial regression-fitting algorithm and a small number of sample observations, and proposes a speed regulation strategy and particle swarm optimizationâproportionalâintegralâderivative algorithm for the variable-belt-speed energy-saving control of a belt conveyor based on the material flow rate. The control strategy and algorithm adjust the running speed of the belt conveyor accurately according to changes in the material flow rate, thus reducing damage of frequent speed regulation to the belt conveyor and saving energy. Simulation analysis of a practical case shows that energy-saving belt-speed model, speed regulation strategy, and algorithm effectively reduce the energy consumption of a belt conveyor, and they thus have high application value in coal, ports, power, mine, metallurgy, chemical, and other industries. Further work in this field can be focused on the prediction of material flow rate of belt conveyor, the controllable adjustment duration of algorithm and the reduction of overshoot."
https://openalex.org/W3129664337,"Background Humans life histories have been described as âslowâ, patterned by slow growth, delayed maturity, and long life span. While it is known that human life history diverged from that of a recent common chimpanzee-human ancestor some ~4â8 mya, it is unclear how selection pressures led to these distinct traits. To provide insight, we compare wild chimpanzees and human subsistence societies in order to identify the age-specific vital rates that best explain fitness variation, selection pressures and species divergence. Methods We employ Life Table Response Experiments to quantify vital rate contributions to population growth rate differences. Although widespread in ecology, these methods have not been applied to human populations or to inform differences between humans and chimpanzees. We also estimate correlations between vital rate elasticities and life history traits to investigate differences in selection pressures and test several predictions based on life history theory. Results Chimpanzeesâ earlier maturity and higher adult mortality drive species differences in population growth, whereas infant mortality and fertility variation explain differences between human populations. Human fitness is decoupled from longevity by postreproductive survival, while chimpanzees forfeit higher potential lifetime fertility due to adult mortality attrition. Infant survival is often lower among humans, but lost fitness is recouped via short birth spacing and high peak fertility, thereby reducing selection on infant survival. Lastly, longevity and delayed maturity reduce selection on child survival, but among humans, recruitment selection is unexpectedly highest in longer-lived populations, which are also faster-growing due to high fertility. Conclusion Humans differ from chimpanzees more because of delayed maturity and lower adult mortality than from differences in juvenile mortality or fertility. In both species, high child mortality reflects bet-hedging costs of quality/quantity tradeoffs borne by offspring, with high and variable child mortality likely regulating human population growth over evolutionary history. Positive correlations between survival and fertility among human subsistence populations leads to selection pressures in human subsistence societies that differ from those in modern populations undergoing demographic transition."
https://openalex.org/W3132168463,"The fibronectin type III (FN3) monobody domain is a promising non-antibody scaffold, which features a less complex architecture than an antibody while maintaining analogous binding loops. We previously developed FN3Con, a hyperstable monobody derivative with diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Prestabilization of the scaffold mitigates the stabilityâfunction trade-off commonly associated with evolving a protein domain toward biological activity. Here, we aimed to examine if the FN3Con monobody could take on antibody-like binding to therapeutic targets, while retaining its extreme stability. We targeted the first of the Adnectin derivative of monobodies to reach clinical trials, which was engineered by directed evolution for binding to the therapeutic target VEGFR2; however, this function was gained at the expense of large losses in thermostability and increased oligomerization. In order to mitigate these losses, we grafted the binding loops from Adnectin-anti-VEGFR2 (CT-322) onto the prestabilized FN3Con scaffold to produce a domain that successfully bound with high affinity to the therapeutic target VEGFR2. This FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 construct also maintains high thermostability, including remarkable long-term stability, retaining binding activity after 2 years of storage at 36 Â°C. Further investigations into buffer excipients doubled the presence of monomeric monobody in accelerated stability trials. These data suggest that loop grafting onto a prestabilized scaffold is a viable strategy for the development of monobody domains with desirable biophysical characteristics and that FN3Con is therefore well-suited to applications such as the evolution of multiple paratopes or shelf-stable diagnostics and therapeutics.

Developing a small, simple protein domain that includes a similar sized binding region to antibody complementarity determining regions (CDRs) is a successful strategy for overcoming the complexity of antibody structure. Non-antibody scaffolds are single domains, typically smaller than 20 kDa in molecular weight, and mostly free of glycosylation or disulfide bonds that require eukaryotic expression (1Crook Z.R.

Med. 2019; 11eaar6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). An important consideration in the ability to evolve a non-antibody scaffold for binding is the combination of a high initial stability and a mutationally robust framework. The small size and lack of redundant framework regions in non-antibody scaffolds result in protein domains that will accumulate only a few mutations to their variable regions before stability becomes compromised (2Vazquez-Lombardi R. Phan T.G. Zimmermann C. Lowe D. Jermutus L. Christ D. Challenges and opportunities for non-antibody scaffold drugs.Drug Discov.

Biotechnol. 2011; 22: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Most monobody derivatives typically lose â¼40 Â°C of thermostability upon evolution for binding (2Vazquez-Lombardi R. Phan T.G. Zimmermann C. Lowe D. Jermutus L. Christ D. Challenges and opportunities for non-antibody scaffold drugs.Drug Discov. Today. 2015; 20: 1271-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), which often results in insoluble expression in bacteria that must be resolved through later rounds of evolution (15Olson C.A.

Biol. 2008; 3: 480-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Critical to the design of next-generation therapeutics, poor biophysical properties such as thermostability and poor or insoluble expression hinder scaffold âdevelopabilityâ and correlate to higher risk of failure in during clinical development (16Jain T.

Sci. 2015; 104: 1885-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). There are multiple approaches of improving the stability of protein folds (18Chandler P.G. Broendum S.S. Riley B.T. Spence M.A. Jackson C.J. McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Strategies for increasing protein stability.Methods Mol. Biol. 2020; 2073: 163-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Protein stability exists between two critical thresholds, where a protein is able to fold into a stable, native three-dimensional shape but is also still dynamic enough to perform its functions (19Stimple S.D. Smith M.D. Tessier P.M. Directed evolution methods for overcoming trade-offs between protein activity and stability.AIChE J. 2020; 66e16814Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Petrovic D. Risso V.A. Kamerlin S.C.L. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Conformational dynamics and enzyme evolution.J. R. Soc. Interface. 2018; 15: 20180330Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As proteins evolve over time, the resulting mutations are more likely to be detrimental to stability of the native fold than neutral or positive and may reduce protein stability below the folding threshold (21Tokuriki N. Stricher F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L. Tawfik D.S. The stability effects of protein mutations appear to be universally distributed.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 1318-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). This is often considered as a natural trade-off between stability and activity and can be a severe limitation to directed evolution experiments (22Tokuriki N. Tawfik D.S. Stability effects of mutations and protein evolvability.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 596-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 23Bloom J.D. Labthavikul S.T. Otey C.R. Arnold F.H. Protein stability promotes evolvability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5869-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Therefore, as a protein scaffold takes on mutations to a variable region to improve binding, it is at risk of deleterious losses in thermostability. Accordingly, proteins with improved initial thermostability are able to sample a larger proportion of this destabilizing sequence space as neutral mutationsâthey are more mutationally robustâwhich in turn increases the chance of reaching novel functions (24Besenmatter W. Kast P. Hilvert D. Relative tolerance of mesostable and thermostable protein homologs to extensive mutation.Proteins. 2006; 66: 500-506Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 25Romero P.A. Arnold F.H.

Selection enhances protein evolvability by increasing mutational robustness and foldability.Science. 2020; 370eabb5962Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In this way, prestabilization can enhance both evolvabilityâthe ability of a protein to evolve new functions (23Bloom J.D. Labthavikul S.T. Otey C.R. Arnold F.H. Protein stability promotes evolvability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 5869-5874Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar), and developabilityâthe biophysical likelihood of successful development from a lead protein into a therapeutic drug (17Jarasch A. Koll H. Regula J.T. Bader M. Papadimitriou A. Kettenberger H. Developability assessment during the selection of novel therapeutic antibodies.J. Pharm. Sci. 2015; 104: 1885-1898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). From a drug development perspective, the native thermostability of a protein correlates with expression titre and improves critical quality attributes such as shelf-life (16Jain T. Sun T. Durand S.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 944-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), while also expanding the range of storage formulations which can be used in a drug product (28Falconer R.J. Advances in liquid formulations of parenteral therapeutic proteins.Biotechnol. Adv. 2019; 37: 107412Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Biological formulations need to remain stable for at least 2 years at 5 Â°C, and storage buffers are usually applied to reach this target. This has resulted in a standard set of buffer formulations across industry that are well-validated and focused on reducing aggregation or other loss of active protein (29Falconer R.J. Chan C. Hughes K. Munro T.P. Stabilization of a monoclonal antibody during purification and formulation by addition of basic amino acid excipients.J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol. 2011; 86: 942-948Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, this sole focus on protein stability limits the exploration of nonstandard formulations, which benefit other critical quality attributes (28Falconer R.J.

Previously, we used consensus design to produce the prestabilized FN3Con monobody, which has substantially increased thermostability compared with similar fibronectin domains (38Porebski B.T. Nickson A.A. Hoke D.E. Hunter M.R. Zhu L. McGowan S. Webb G.I. Buckle A.M. Structural and dynamic properties that govern the stability of an engineered fibronectin type III domain.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2015; 28: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mutational robustness of FN3Con was then demonstrated by grafting binding loops from an FN3 scaffold that had been selected by laboratory evolution to bind lysozyme with high affinity (39Porebski B.T. Conroy P.J. Drinkwater N. Schofield P. Vazquez-Lombardi R. Hunter M.R. Hoke D.E. Christ D. McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Circumventing the stability-function trade-off in an engineered FN3 domain.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2016; 29: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Whereas binding function was completely transferred, the trade-off in thermostability was negligible compared with that which occurred upon directed evolution of the original scaffold. In the current study, we aimed to establish whether FN3Con can harbor valuable loop sequences that confer clinical inhibition of a target but were detrimental to stability in established scaffolds. For this study we chose an Adnectin domain that was previously subjected to directed evolution for high-affinity binding to the therapeutic target VEGFR2, with function gained at the expense of large losses in thermostability and increased oligomerization propensity (40Parker M.H.

Chen Y. et al.Anti-tumor effect of CT-322 as an Adnectin inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.mAbs. 2010; 2: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We grafted binding loops from Adnectin-anti-VEGFR2 onto the FN3Con scaffold to produce a recombined domain that retained binding affinity. The FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 graft was expressed in E. coli with little aggregation and maintained characteristically high thermostability, including 24-month stability at 37 Â°C. An early exploration of buffer excipients produced further stability improvements. We discuss the implications of generating clinical leads by salvaging loop sequences from scaffolds with challenging biophysical features and the importance of designing highly âevolvableâ constructs on downstream factors of scaffold âdevelopability.â We chose the Adnectin-anti-VEGFR2 monobody âCT-322â as a candidate for loop grafting to the hyperstable FN3Con in order to test our hypothesis that a stabilized scaffold can rescue stability losses accrued after evolutionary selection for high-affinity binding. This Adnectin was generated from mRNA display against a construct of seven extracellular domains of VEGFR2 fused with a human antibody Fc region, generating high-affinity binding (KD = 0.31 nM) but with a 34 Â°C loss in thermostability (Tm) and also at cost to oligomerization resistance (40Parker M.H.

Conroy P.J. Drinkwater N. Schofield P. Vazquez-Lombardi R. Hunter M.R. Hoke D.E. Christ D. McGowan S. Buckle A.M. Circumventing the stability-function trade-off in an engineered FN3 domain.Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2016; 29: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to guide the transfer of evolved binding loops to FN3Con, designing FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 [Fig. 1A and B]. Additionally, the entire Adnectin C-terminal tail was reported to be critical to high-affinity binding and was also transferred (40Parker M.H. Chen Y. Danehy F. Dufu K. Ekstrom J. Getmanova E.V. Gokemeijer J. Xu L. Lipovsek D.

Sel. 2005; 18: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 displayed high-affinity binding to VEGFR2 (KD = 0.72 nM) [Table 1], very similar to the published affinity of Adnectin-anti-VEGFR2 (KD = 0.31 nM) (41Mamluk R. Carvajal I.M.

We carried out affinity measurement through an orthogonal approach, where two independent methods provided a KD range of 0.72 to 48.79 nM [Fig. 1, C and D and Table 1], with the KD of 0.72 nM derived from Biacore data presenting the most robust fits to derive underlying equilibrium constants while controlling for confounding nonspecific binding and mass transport effects. The ELISA data validated this 2- to 3-fold difference in affinity between binders, although nonspecific binding likely increased the measured KD for both monobodies.Table 1Methodology and results for VEGFR2 binding experiments in Figure 1ProteinSurface plasmon resonance (SPR) KDELISA KDAdnectin-anti-VEGFR20.31 nMaSPR KD from (41), ELISA values are KD Â± SE.16.87 nM Â± 4.26FN3Con-anti-VEGFR20.72 nM Â±0.2148.79 nM Â± 6.78Analysis Fold Difference2.322.89 FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 Model FitR2 = 0.95R2 = 0.98 Immobilized proteinVEGFR2VEGFR2 MeasureChange in refractive indexConcentration of Biotinylated proteina SPR KD from (41Mamluk R.

Open table in a new tab The Adnectin-anti-VEGFR2 undergoes irreversible thermal denaturation with a Tm of 50 Â°C Â± 0.4 Â°C, as measured by circular dichroism (CD), with visible precipitate upon cooling [Fig. 2A]. In striking contrast, FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 unfolds reversibly with a Tm of 89 Â°C Â± 0.2 Â°C [Fig. 2B]. The Tm of the Adnectin-anti-VEGFR2 was not previously published (41Mamluk R. Carvajal I.M.

Chen Y. et al.Anti-tumor effect of CT-322 as an Adnectin inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.mAbs. 2010; 2: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but our results closely match a precursor Adnectin-anti-VEGFR2 variant of similar affinity, thermostability, and loop sequences (40Parker M.H. Chen Y. Danehy F. Dufu K. Ekstrom J. Getmanova E.V. Gokemeijer J. Xu L. Lipovsek D.

Sel. 2005; 18: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This trajectory of loss in Adnectin thermostability presents the trade-offs that take place as affinity is further matured. In contrast, while the FN3Con scaffold loses â¼10 Â°C of thermostability after loop grafting, scaffold stability remains substantially higher than the parent Adnectin molecules, while also retaining reversible refolding. We next investigated the effect of FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 hyperstability on long-term stability (LTS) and binding activity, as a proxy for extended shelf-life. The Adnectin-anti-VEGFR2 sample completely aggregates within 1 monthâs storage at 36 Â°C in PBS [Fig. 2C]. In contrast, the FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 remained in solution for at least 24 months, with â¼30% of the total sample remaining as a monomer after 2 years storage at 36 Â°C [Fig. 2D]. Up to 50% of the FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 high-order species observed formed between 0 and 6 months at 36 Â°C, after which oligomer formation stabilized. Accordingly, FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 presented extended LTS at 4 Â°C, remaining as a monomeric protein in extended trials up to 24 months of storage in PBS buffer [Fig. 2E]. Strikingly, high-affinity binding (KD â¼157 nM) to VEGFR2 was maintained after 24 months at 36 Â°C [Fig. 2F], although the observed affinity for the total sample is threefold lower than âfreshâ FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 (KD â¼49 nM). This suggests that only the â¼30% monomeric fraction retains binding affinity to the target. Given the results from accelerated stability testing, our final investigation explored the effect of stabilizing excipients on further improving the shelf-life properties of the FN3Con-anti-VEGFR2 construct. After incubation at 40 Â°C for 30 days with five different buffer excipients (16Jain T. Sun T. Durand S. Hall A. Houston N.R. Nett J.H. Sharkey B. Bobrowicz B. Caffry I. Yu Y. Cao Y. Lynaugh H.

Excipients such as Tween80 provide resistance to factors such as hydrophobic unfolding from shaking during storage (28Falconer R.J.

Previously, we have shown that FN3Con is robust to the stabilityâfunction trade-off (39Porebski B.T. Conroy P.J. Drinkwater N. Schofield P. Vazquez-Lombardi R. Hunter M.R. Hoke D.E. Christ D.

https://openalex.org/W3130269643,"The species Chironomus sp. âFloridaâ has several qualities that make it a potential aquatic laboratory model to be used in Puerto Rico. Its use as such, however, requires a rearing protocol and life cycle description not previously reported. The present study addresses this lack of information by first describing a rearing method obtained through three years of observations. Next we describe and discuss the life cycle and the effects of temperature and feeding on development. The species has a short life cycle (typically 11 days) and larval stages easily identified using body measurements. Temperature affects the duration of the life cycle, with warm temperatures producing faster development than cold temperatures. The effects of different food concentrations vary: in large water volumes, concentrations of 2 mg/larva/day produce faster developmental times, but at low water volumes, small food concentrations of 0.5 mg/larva/day produce faster developmental times. The rearing protocol and life cycle parameters presented in this study are intended to promote the use of this species as a laboratory model. The fast development of Chironomus sp. âFloridaâ makes it ideal for toxicological studies."
https://openalex.org/W3131550007,"Background Increased exposure to Ozone (O 3 ) is associated with adverse health effects in individuals afflicted with respiratory diseases. Surfactant protein-A (SP-A), encoded by SP-A1 and SP-A2 , is the largest protein component in pulmonary surfactant and is functionally impaired by O 3 -oxidation. Objective We used humanized SP-A2 transgenic mice with allelic variation corresponding to a glutamine (Q) to lysine (K) amino acid substitution at position 223 in the lectin domain to determine the impact of this genetic variation in regards to O 3 exposure. Methods Mice were exposed to 2ppm O 3 or Filtered Air (FA) for 3 hours and 24 hrs post-challenge pulmonary function tests and other parameters associated with inflammation were assessed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue. Additionally, mouse tracheal epithelial cells were cultured and TEER measurements recorded for each genotype to determine baseline epithelial integrity. Results Compared to FA, O 3 exposure led to significantly increased sensitivity to methacholine challenge in all groups of mice. SP-A2 223Q variant mice were significantly protected from O 3 -induced AHR compared to SP-A -/- and SP-A2 223K mice. Neutrophilia was observed in all genotypes of mice post O 3 -exposure, however, SP-A2 223Q mice had a significantly lower percentage of neutrophils compared to SP-A -/- mice. Albumin levels in BAL were unchanged in O 3 -exposed SP-A2 223Q mice compared to their FA controls, while levels were significantly increased in all other genotypes of O 3 -exposed mice. SP-A 223Q MTECS has significant higher TEER values than all other genotypes, and WT MTECS has significantly higher TEER than the SP-A KO and SP-A 223K MTECS. Significance Taken together, our study suggests that expression of a glutamine (Q) as position 223 in SP-A2, as opposed to expression of lysine (K), is more protective in acute exposures to ozone and results in attenuated O 3 -induced AHR, neutrophilia, and vascular permeability."
https://openalex.org/W3132981627,"Hck, a Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (SFK), has recently been established as an attractive pharmacological target to improve pulmonary function in COVID-19 patients. Hck inhibitors are also well known for their regulatory role in various malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Curcumin has been previously identified as an excellent DYRK-2 inhibitor, but curcumin's fate is tainted by its instability in the cellular environment. Besides, small molecules targeting the inactive states of a kinase are desirable to reduce promiscuity. Here, we show that functionalization of the 4-arylidene position of the fluorescent curcumin scaffold with an aryl nitrogen mustard provides a stable Hck inhibitor (Kd = 50 Â± 10 nM). The mustard curcumin derivative preferentially interacts with the inactive conformation of Hck, similar to type-II kinase inhibitors that are less promiscuous. Moreover, the lead compound showed no inhibitory effect on three other kinases (DYRK2, Src, and Abl). We demonstrate that the cytotoxicity may be mediated via inhibition of the SFK signaling pathway in triple-negative breast cancer and murine macrophage cells.

Our data suggest that curcumin is a modifiable fluorescent scaffold to develop selective kinase inhibitors by remodeling its target affinity and cellular stability. Curcumin, an active molecule against inflammation, microbial infections, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases loses its drug-like potential due to its instability in the cellular environment (1Nelson Kathryn M. Walters Michael A. Dahlin Jayme L. Bisson J. Graham J. Pauli Guido F. Pauli Guido F. The essential medicinal chemistry of curcumin.J. Med. Chem. 2017; 60: 1620-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). Besides, the planar symmetry makes curcumin less druggable toward asymmetric binding pockets such as kinases (2Knight Z.A. Shokat K.M. Features of selective kinase inhibitors.Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 621-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Albeit, it is undeniable that pure curcumin shows excellent selectivity toward the DFG-Asp-in, active conformation of dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2) (3Banerjee S. Ji C. Mayfield J.E. Goel A. Xiao J. Dixon J.E. Guo X. Ancient drug curcumin impedes 26S proteasome activity by direct inhibition of dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 8155-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The drugability of curcumin may be improved by nanoformulation and modification at relevant positions to enhance stability and specificity. A recent report suggests that curcumin self-assembles in the presence of Zn(II) and F-moc histidine to adopt nanoformulations enhancing stability (4Li Y. Zou Q. Yuan C. Li S. Xing R. Yan X.

Engl. 2018; 57: 17084-17088Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The functionalization of the methylenic position in the diketone motif of curcumin provides stable derivatives and introduces nonplanarity in the conformation (5Qiu X. Du Y. Lou B. Zuo Y. Shao W.

Analysis of the recent DYRK2 kinase domain structure in complex with curcumin suggests that the modification at the methylenic position in the diketone motif may prevent the docking of the curcumin derivatives to the ATP-binding pocket (Fig. 1A). We asked if the functionalization of the methylenic position will remodel the target preference of the curcumin compounds toward other kinases, namely Src, Hck, and Abl (Fig. 1B)? It may be noted that the clinical kinase inhibitors target one or more of the following conformations: the DFG-Asp-in active, the DFG-Asp-out Abl/cKit like inactive, or the DFG-Asp-in c-Src/CDK like inactive conformation (Fig. 1A) (8Zhang S.

Most type-I inhibitors targeting the active conformation are promiscuous as all kinases share more or less the same conformation in their active state. Type-II kinase inhibitors targeting the inactive conformations are desirable since the kinases adapt specific inactive conformation reducing the promiscuity. We targeted to design stable curcumin derivatives by modifying the methylenic position. The functionalization of the methylenic position in the diketone motif by 4-arylidene substituents would deter the free-radical-driven incorporation of oxygen in the curcumin scaffold, known to be occuring spontaneously in native curcumin at physiological pH (11Gordon O.N.

The 4-aryl substituents (Fig. 1C) were chosen to promote noncovalent interactions with the ligand-binding pocket of the inactive form of the aforementioned kinases. Here in, we show that suitable functionalization of the methylenic position enhances the cellular stability and remodels the affinity toward DFG-in inactive conformation of Hck, instead of DYRK2. Hck is an attractive pharmacological target for its regulatory role in cancer development and virus infection (13Poh Ashleigh R. O'Donoghue Robert J.J. Ernst M. O'Donoghue Robert J.J. Ernst M.

Hck expresses explicitly in myeloid and B-lymphocyte lineage cells and regulates immune receptor signaling, cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation (15Miranda M.B. Johnson D.E.

Recently, inhibition of Hck by ibrutinib in COVID-19 patients showed protection against lung injury and improved pulmonary function (17Treon S.P. Castillo J.J. Skarbnik A.P. Soumerai J.D.

We first made an in silico assessment of the ability of the compounds 1 to 5 to bind at the ligand-binding pocket of DYRK2 and different conformations of Abl and Src kinase domain (Fig. 1, A and C and Fig. S1A). The docking studies showed that the curcumin derivatives might have preserved the binding affinity toward DYRK2. Next, we probed, if the modified compounds have gained specificity toward the active or inactive conformations of the ligand-binding pocket. The curcumin did not distinguish between the active or inactive conformation of Src or Abl kinase domain (Fig. S1A). The plot of relative change in docking scores of 2 to 5 suggests that the functionalized curcumins bind preferentially to the DFG-Asp-in cSrc/CDK like inactive conformation (Fig. S1A). Kinase inhibitors targeted against the inactive state are desirable due to higher selectivity and potency (2Knight Z.A. Shokat K.M. Features of selective kinase inhibitors.Chem.

The synthetic method is a single-step Knoevenagel condensation of curcumin with the respective aldehydes (Fig. S2A). The curcumin (1) used in synthesis was purified by column chromatography from the crude commercial mixture. We first evaluated the stability of 2 to 5 in comparison with curcumin in aqueous solution. The UVâvisible data showed that the compounds 3 to 5 have greater solution half-lives (t1/2) in pH 7.4 (1Ã phospahte buffered saline [PBS] containing 5% DMSO) (Fig. 1E, Fig. S2, CâG and Table S1) compared with 1 and 2. Next, we studied the stability of 1 to 5 under the kinase assay condition (Fig. 1C). The bis(2-chloroethylamine) motif bearing compound 4 is the most stable under near-physiological conditions in the kinase assay buffer. Compound 4 also demonstrated to be stable for at least 24 h (observed period) in 8:2 v/v of 1x PBS and DMSO-d6 in 1H NMR (Fig. S18). We determined the activity of 1 to 5, against DYRK2, Src, Hck, and Abl kinases (Fig. 2A) using coupled kinase assay. Curcumin inhibits DYRK2 kinase activity with Ki of 6 nM similar to the previous report (3Banerjee S. Ji C. Mayfield J.E. Goel A. Xiao J. Dixon J.E. Guo X. Ancient drug curcumin impedes 26S proteasome activity by direct inhibition of dual-specificity tyrosine-regulated kinase 2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 8155-8160Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) but compounds 2 to 5 do not (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3). Besides, 1 to 5 also display poor activity against Abl kinase (Ki > 3000 nM) in comparison with imatinib (Ki > 60 nM) (22Seeliger M.A. Nagar B. Frank F. Cao X. Henderson M.N.

Compound 4 selectively inhibits Hck and Src kinase activity (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3) with Ki of 70 Â± 11 nM and 460 Â± 110 nM, respectively. Compound 1 to 3, 5, and imatinib showed a relatively weak inhibitory effect on Src and Hck (Ki more than tenfold compared to 4) (Fig. 2A and Fig. S3). We used imatinib as a control due to its specificity toward DFG-Asp-out Abl/cKit like inactive structure (Fig. 1A) (23Nagar B. Bornmann W.G. Pellicena P. Schindler T. Veach D.R. Miller W.T.

Unlike Src, Abl kinase can adopt all three conformations of the kinase domain (Fig. 1A) (25Kwarcinski F.E. Brandvold K.R. Phadke S. Beleh O.M. Johnson T.K. Meagher J.L. Seeliger M.A. Stuckey J.A.

Biol. 2016; 11: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, the majority of ATP-competitive, noncovalent Src inhibitors would be promiscuous to Abl. The specific inhibition of Src and Hck over Abl by 4 suggests that it is possibly binding to an inactive conformation of the Src kinase domain. We ruled out the interaction of 4 to the DFG-out inactive conformation of Src due to its relatively higher thermodynamic penalty. (22Seeliger M.A. Nagar B. Frank F. Cao X. Henderson M.N.

Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism and mode of action of 4. We first investigated if the oligomerization of 4 could explain the mode of kinase inhibition. The oligomeric state of 1 and 4 was determined from the hydrodynamic radius measured using the dynamic light scattering in an aqueous buffer (Fig. S2, HâK) and compared with imatinib and sucrose. Unlike curcumin (1), we observed that 4 did not aggregate in solution and behaved similar to imatinib. Selective type-II inhibitors targeted against the inactive conformation of Abl are sensitive to the phosphorylation state of the activation loop (24Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T.

A. 1981; 78: 6013-6017Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The inhibitors that are nonselective for Src and Abl are often not sensitive to the phosphorylation of the kinase activation loop (29Hari S.B. Perera B.G.K. Ranjitkar P. Seeliger M.A. Maly D.J. Conformation-selective inhibitors reveal differences in the activation and phosphate-binding loops of the tyrosine kinases Abl and Src.ACS Chem. Biol. 2013; 8: 2734-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Hence, we prepared and purified unphosphorylated Src and Hck, which was uniformly phosphorylated by treating with ATP and magnesium (Fig. S4B). Then the activity of the phosphorylated Hck (pY-Hck) and Src (pY-Src) was assayed in a time-dependent manner. The results show that 4 does not inhibit the pY-Hck and pY-Src (Fig. 2B and Fig. S4, C and D) emphasizing its preference toward the inactive conformation of Hck and Src. A hallmark of Src activation is autophosphorylation of the activation loop (27Osusky M. Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Autophosphorylation of purified c-Src at its primary negative regulation site.J. Biol.

We determined the effect of 4 on the rate of autophosphorylation of Src and Hck and found that 4 reduces the rate of autophosphorylation by 2.5- and 500-fold, respectively (Fig. 2D and Fig. S4, E and F). We studied the interaction of 4 with Hck by measuring the kinetics of change in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence by stop-flow fluorimeter. The plot of the rate of change in tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 2C) suggests that 4 preferentially interacts with the inactive unphosphorylated conformation of Hck; thus, further emphasizing that 4 shows preference to bind the inactive conformation and reduces the rate of autophosphorylation of the kinase domain. The crystal structure of DYRK2 in complex with curcumin for the first time showed that curcumin occupies the ATP binding pocket potentially acting as a competitive inhibitor (9Kim L.C. Song L. Haura E.B. Src kinases as therapeutic targets for cancer.Nat. Rev. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 6: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). To find out if 4 could inhibit Hck and Src as an ATP-competitive inhibitor, we determined the Km (MichaelisâMenten constant) for ATP and Vmax (Fig. 2, E and F and Fig. S4, F and G). Increasing concentration of 4 changes the Km without any significant change in the Vmax, indicating that 4 functions as a competitive inhibitor for the ATP-binding site. The above data does not rule out the possibility of covalent modification of the ligand-binding site by the potential alkylating groups in 4, which may explain the specificity toward the SFK. The specificity of several compounds toward Src or Abl is attributed to the different sequence and structural dynamics of the P-loop (22Seeliger M.A. Nagar B. Frank F. Cao X. Henderson M.N. Kuriyan J. c-Src binds to the cancer drug imatinib with an inactive Abl/c-kit conformation and a distributed thermodynamic penalty.Structure. 2007; 15: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 34Lovera S.

Understanding the impact of the P-loop conformation on kinase selectivity.J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2011; 51: 1199-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For example, in Src the Cys277 at the P-loop and Cys400 at the Î²7 could be covalently modified by alkylating agents, explaining the specificity of 4 toward Src (Fig. S5A). In Abl kinase domain, the amino acid residues at the corresponding positions are Gln and Val, respectively, providing no scope for 4 to covalently modify them, unlike a cysteine (36Kwarcinski F.E. Fox C.C. Steffey M.E. Soellner M.B. Irreversible inhibitors of c-Src kinase that target a nonconserved cysteine.ACS Chem. Biol. 2012; 7: 1910-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the aromatic mustard motif is such that the alkylation ability would be low or absent, confirmation was required to exclude covalent modification as a possible mode of inhibition. To confirm the above we incubated the Src kinase domain and 4 in the kinase assay buffer for 1 h. The resultant sample was then analyzed by HPLC under denaturing condition to determine any covalent adduct formation. We observed that the 4-treated Src kinase elutes at the same resident time as untreated Src kinase with no coelution of 4 (Fig. S5C). The respective pure fraction of the protein sample from the HPLC was subjected to ESI-MS, which confirmed that the m/z envelope for the treated and untreated sample (Fig. S5D) corresponds to the unmodified protein. Thus, 4 is not covalently modifying the cysteine residues of Src kinase. We studied the binding kinetics of 4 with DYRK2, Hck, and Abl to understand the mechanism of specificity toward Hck. We monitored the change in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein corresponding to the pre-steady-state kinetics by titration (Fig. 3 and Fig. S6). The Hck binds to 4 with approximately tenfold faster kon rates than Abl and a Kd of 50 Â± 10 nM, which matches with the Ki values from enzyme kinetics (Fig. 3, E and G). DYRK2 did not interact with 4 (Fig. 3A). The above result may be explained by comparing the structure of the ligand-binding-pocket in the Src DFG-Asp-in inactive structure (PDB ID: 2SRC) to the corresponding conformation of Abl kinase domain (PDB ID: 2G1T) (Fig. 3C). The P-loop of Abl takes a closed conformation in comparison to Src, which alters the conformational dynamics of the ligand-binding-pocket (37Agafonov R.V. Wilson C. Otten R. Buosi V. Kern D. Energetic dissection of Gleevec's selectivity toward human tyrosine kinases.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2014; 21: 848-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The Y253 at the P-loop of Abl may sterically block the docking of 4 to the ligand-binding-pocket. In Src, the residue at the corresponding position is substituted by F278 (Fig. 3C and Fig. S5A). The Y253 is a critical residue in Abl, and its mutation to F253 causes imatinib resistance (38Roumiantsev S. Shah N.P. Gorre M.E. Nicoll J. Brasher B.B. Sawyers C.L. Van Etten R.A. Clinical resistance to the kinase inhibitor STI-571 in chronic myeloid leukemia by mutation of tyr-253 in the Abl kinase domain P-loop.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10700-10705Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that the different structural dynamics of the P-loop residues in the Src and Abl kinase domain determine the specificity for 4. To find out if the Y253 is responsible for selectivity, we generated the Y253F mutant Abl to comparatively study imatinib and 4. The Abl Y253F bound weakly to imatinib and did not inhibit the kinase activity (Fig. 3, D, F and G). Whereas 4 binds with sevenfold higher affinity (Kd of 1.3 Â± 0.3 Î¼M) to the Abl Y253F and shows better inhibition compared with imatinib at a given dose (Fig. 3, DâG). The functionalization of the methylenic position in the diketone motif of curcumin by the aryl nitrogen mustard thus altered the target specificity toward Hck over DYRK2, Abl, and Src. In spite of the encouraging results, the instability in the cellular environment may eclipse the potential of 4. We investigated the cellular stability exploiting the green fluorescence of 4, which allows to trace the molecule by live-cell imaging in the triple-negative-breast-cancer (TNBC) cell MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 1D). Curcumin, as expected (1Nelson Kathryn M. Walters Michael A. Dahlin Jayme L. Bisson J. Graham J. Pauli Guido F. Pauli Guido F. The essential medicinal chemistry of curcumin.J. Med. Chem. 2017; 60: 1620-1637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), spontaneously degraded within 1 h inside the cell making it invisible (Fig. S1, BâD). Although the quantum yield (Table S1) of curcumin is higher than 4, the fluorescence of compound 4 was observed inside the MDA-MB-231 cell for 14 h, suggesting its higher stability (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1, E and F). To translate the inhibitory effect of 4 to cell-based experiments, we measured the cytotoxicity on the murine macrophage RAW 264.7, MDA-MB-231 (39Tang Z.-N. Zhang F. Tang P. Qi X.-W. Jiang J. RANKL-induced migration of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells via Src and MAPK activation.Oncol. Rep. 2011; 26: 1243-1250PubMed Google Scholar), colon carcinoma (HT-29) (40Golubovskaya V.M. Gross S. Kaur A.S. Wilson R.I. Xu L.-H. Yang X.H. Cance W.G. Simultaneous inhibition of focal adhesion kinase and Src enhances detachment and apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines.Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 755-764PubMed Google Scholar), and HEK 293T cell line. The comparison of IC50 values (Fig. 4A and Fig. S7A) indicate that the 4 is ten times more potent than curcumin when tested against RAW 264.7, MDA-MB-231, and HT-29 cell lines, respectively. In contrary, 4 is tenfold less cytotoxic to HEK 293T cells (IC50 value of 24.92 Â± 1 Î¼M). This may be because among the above four cell lines HEK293 does not overexpress SFK. DNA cross-linking assay shows that 4 do not cross-link DNA in the in vitro assay (Fig. S7B). We next studied if 4 disrupts the plasma membrane integrity by live-cell imaging of MDA-MB-231 cell line treated with FM4-64-FX, a lipophilic probe used for staining plasma membrane (Fig. S7C) (41Revelo N.H. Kamin D. Truckenbrodt S. Wong A.B. Reuter-Jessen K. Reisinger E. Moser T. Rizzoli S.O. A new probe for super-resolution imaging of membranes elucidates trafficking pathways.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 205: 591-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The results support that 4 is not affecting the membrane integrity of the cells. To evaluate if 4 inhibits Src-dependent cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, we performed a wound-healing assay with MDA-MB-231 and probed the signaling modules regulating the respective pathways (Fig. 4 and Fig. S8). The MDA-MB-231 cells rely on Src signaling for cell migration and metastasis (Fig. 4B) (42Aleem S.U. Georghiou G. Kleiner R.E. Guja K.E. Craddock B.P. Lyczek A. Chan A.I. Garcia-Diaz M. Miller W.T.

Methods pRNFL was measured with a spectral domain optical coherence tomography on 54 healthy participants. Three-dimensional optic disc scans (6 mm x 6 mm) were performed on the right eye of the participants. Two repeated scans were performed in four different settings: H1: Horizontal scan with 512 A-scans x 96 B-scans; H2: Horizontal scan with 512 A-scans x 128 B-scans; V1: Vertical scan with 512 A-scans x 96 B-scans; V2: Vertical scan with 512 A-scans x 128 B-scans. The pRNFL thickness was evaluated in twelve clock-hour sector in a circle of 3.45 mm diameter centred at the optic disc. Repeatability and agreement were assessed with within subject standard deviation (Sw) and Bland-Altman test respectively. Results The repeatability of pRNFL measurements varied depending on the scan direction and sectors. The repeatability for the horizontal sectors were better with H1 and H2, with sector 9 having the best Sw (&lt; 3 Î¼m). The repeatability for the vertical sectors were better with V1 and V2 with sector 5 and 9 having the best Sw (&lt; 4 Î¼m). The repeatability with vertical scan was more symmetric among the sectors than with horizontal scans. The repeatability metrics of the sectors did not vary much between H1 and H2 (difference &lt; 2 Î¼m) and between V1 and V2 (difference &lt; 3.2 Î¼m). Comparing horizontal and vertical scans, the vertical sectors had larger limits of agreement of about 45 Î¼m. Conclusion The reliability of the pRNFL thickness measurements is dependent on the direction of the scan and independent on the numbers of B-scans. Vertical scans for pRNFL gives more homogeneous repeatability across the different sectors."
https://openalex.org/W3129404461,"Absolute Pitch (AP) is commonly defined as a rare ability that allows an individual to identify any pitch by name. Most researchers use classificatory tests for AP which tracks the number of isolated correct answers. However, each researcher chooses their own procedure for what should be considered correct or incorrect in measuring this ability. Consequently, it is impossible to evaluate comparatively how the stimuli and criteria classify individuals in the same way. We thus adopted a psychometric perspective, approaching AP as a latent trait. Via the Latent Variable Model, we evaluated the consistency and validity for a measure to test for AP ability. A total of 783 undergraduate music students participated in the test. The test battery comprised 10 isolated pitches. All collected data were analyzed with two different rating criteria ( perfect and imperfect ) under three Latent Variable Model approaches: continuous (Item Response Theory with two and three parameters), categorical (Latent Class Analysis), and the Hybrid model. According to model fit information indices, the perfect approach (only exact pitch responses as correct) measurement model had a better fit under the trait (continuous) specification. This contradicts the usual assumption of a division between AP and non-AP possessors. Alternatively, the categorical solution for the two classes demonstrated the best solution for the imperfect approach (exact pitch responses and semitone deviations considered as correct)."
https://openalex.org/W3129689232,"Background HIV is a major global public health challenge, claiming the lives of over 32 million people so far. The satisfaction of HIV-affected clients with the quality of their HIV services at treatment centres is crucial for quality improvement. This article assesses clientsâ satisfaction with different aspects of the overall care experience and seeks to determine if the type of health facility ownership is a predictor of satisfaction. Methods A cross-sectional study involving 430 respondents was conducted between September and October 2019. Purposeful and convenient sampling techniques were used to select health facilities and potential respondents, respectively. A pre-tested, interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between type of health facility and clientsâ satisfaction based on the six assessed aspects of care, and pË0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The general clientsâ satisfaction with HIV/AIDS services at care and treatment centres was 92.3%. Respondents from public health facilities were most satisfied with privacy and confidentiality (100%), physical environment (100%), counseling (99.5%) and drug availability (99.5%); respondents from private health facilities were most satisfied with the time spent in the facility (95.9%); while respondents from faith-based health facilities were most satisfied with staff-patient communication (99.2%). However, after adjusting for confounders, only one aspect of care, that of âtime spent in the facility,â showed significant association with the type of health facility. Conclusion Generally, clientsâ satisfaction with HIV/AIDS services at care and treatment centres in the Ubungo District, Dar es Salaam was high. This finding should encourage health care providers to maintain high-quality services to sustain clientsâ satisfaction."
https://openalex.org/W3130580363,"Vaso-occlusive episodes (VOEs) are a hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), and account for &gt;90% of health care encounters for this patient population. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, a large study enrolling &gt;3000 patients, showed that the majority of SCD patients (80%) experienced 0â3 major pain crises/year. Only a small minority (~5%) experienced â¥6 VOEs/year. Our study sought to further understand this difference in VOE frequency between SCD patients. We analyzed 25 patients (13M/12F, mean age of 28.8) with â¥6 ED visits or hospitalizations/year (high utilizers), and compared these with 9 patients (6M/3F, mean age of 37.6) who had â¤2 ED visits or hospitalizations/year (low utilizers). All subjects were given a demographic survey along with questionnaires for depression, anxiety, and Health Locus of Control. Each subject then underwent quantitative sensory testing (QST) with three different modalities: pressure pain sensitivity, heat and cold sensitivity, and Von Frey monofilament testing. Laboratory and clinical data were collected through subjectsâ medical records. CBC and chemistry analysis showed high utilizers had higher WBC (p&lt;0.01), ANC (p&lt;0.01), total bilirubin (p = 0.02), and lower MCV (p = 0.03). Opioid use (morphine equivalents) over the past 6 months was significantly higher in the high utilizer group (12125.7 mg vs 2423.1 mg, p = 0.005). QST results showed lower pressure pain threshold at the ulna (224.4 KPa vs 338.9 KPa, p = 0.04) in the high utilizer group. High utilizers also had higher anxiety (9.0 vs 4.6, p = 0.04) and depression scores (10.0 vs 6.0, p = 0.051). While the low utilizer group had higher education levels with more associate and bachelor degrees (p = 0.009), there was no difference in income or employment. These data show that many biological and psychosocial factors contribute to high health care utilization in SCD. A multi-disciplinary and multi-faceted approach will be required to address this complex problem."
https://openalex.org/W3130974124,"Whether osteoarthritis (OA) is a systemic metabolic disorder remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic characteristics between plasma and knee joint fluid (JF) of patients with advanced OA using a differential correlation metabolic (DCM) networks approach. Plasma and JF were collected during the joint replacement surgery of patients with knee OA. The biological samples were pretreated with standard procedures for metabolite analysis. The metabolic profiling was conducted by means of liquid mass spectrometry coupled with a AbsoluteIDQ kit. A DCM network approach was adopted for analyzing the metabolomics data between the plasma and JF. The variation in the correlation of the pairwise metabolites was quantified across the plasma and JF samples, and networks analysis was used to characterize the difference in the correlations of the metabolites from the two sample types. Core metabolites that played an important role in the DCM networks were identified via topological analysis. One hundred advanced OA patients (50 men and 50 women) were included in this study, with an average age of 65.0 Â± 7.6 years (65.6 Â± 7.1 years for females and 64.4 Â± 8.1 years for males) and a mean BMI of 32.6 Â± 5.8 kg/m 2 (33.4 Â± 6.3 kg/m 2 for females and 31.7 Â± 5.3 kg/m 2 for males). Age and BMI matched between the male and female groups. One hundred and forty-five nodes, 567 edges, and 131 nodes, 407 edges were found in the DCM networks (p &lt; 0.05) of the female and male groups, respectively. Six metabolites in the female group and 5 metabolites in the male group were identified as key nodes in the network. There was a significant difference in the differential correlation metabolism networks of plasma and JF that may be related to local joint metabolism. Focusing on these key metabolites may help uncover the pathogenesis of knee OA. In addition, the differential metabolic correlation between plasma and JF mostly overlapped, indicating that these common correlations of pairwise metabolites may be a reflection of systemic characteristics of JF and that most significant correlation variations were just a result of ""housekeepingâ biological reactions."
https://openalex.org/W3131696420,"Isostichopus badionotus and Isostichopus sp. are two holothuroids exploited in the Caribbean region of Colombia. Until recently, they were considered a single species. During one year, 222 individuals of Isostichopus sp. and 114 of I . badionotus were collected in two bays of the Santa Marta region to study their reproductive biology and collect information on their size, weight and habitat. Both sea cucumber morphotypes showed an annual reproductive cycle, with a reproductive season from September to November, closely related to the increase in water temperature and rainfall. In both sea cucumbers the population structure exhibited a unimodal distribution composed of mature individuals and a sex ratio of 1:1. Isostichopus sp. had an average size and weight (193 Â± 52 mm and 178 Â± 69 g) and size and weight at first maturity (175 mm and 155 g) that was much lower than I . badionotus (respectively, 324 Â± 70 mm and 628 Â± 179 g; 220 mm and 348 g). While 98% of Isostichopus sp. individuals were collected in the upper 2.5 m, on rocky bottoms between cracks, 73% of I . badionotus individuals were found between 3 and 7.8 m depth, exposed on sandy bottoms. These differences imply that management measures (e.g. minimum catch size) should not be the same for both sea cucumbers morphotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3131795542,"Anticholinergic plants of the family Solanaceae have a long history of use as medicines, poisons, and recreational drugs. Though they were the intoxicating substances of choice throughout Europe for centuries, their use for these purposes has declined with the globalisation of other recreational drugs. The present study sought to examine the level of knowledge surrounding these plants among individuals who had used other hallucinogenic plants or mushrooms in Slovenia. Participants were questioned in regards to the anticholinergic Solanaceae that are known to grow wild in Slovenia: Atropa belladonna L., Datura stramonium L., Hyoscyamus niger L., and Scopolia carniolica L. As expected, only a small number of individuals had any substantial knowledge of these plants, and fewer still had used them; some were even unfamiliar with any of these plants. Knowledge of toxicity generally arose from family members, while books and the internet played prominent roles in regards to use knowledge. Knowledge of the plants was vastly varied, with many individuals confusing the plants for others, especially other members of the Solanaceae. Ultimately, a small group of individuals had the largest body of knowledge of these plants, though this was linked with university studies rather than traditional uses. Knowledge of the intoxicating Solanaceae has been largely lost in Slovenia among users of other botanical hallucinogens, likely due to the various dangers their use poses and the undesirable effects they often cause."

Current approaches to analyzing CAPL-2 raw data are tedious, inefficient, and/or can lead to computation errors. In this paper we introduce the capl R package (open source), designed to compute and visualize CAPL-2 scores and interpretations from raw data. The capl package takes advantage of the R environment to provide users with a fast, efficient, and reliable approach to analyzing their CAPL-2 raw data and a âquietâ user experience, whereby ânoisyâ error messages are suppressed via validation. We begin by discussing several preparatory steps that are required prior to using the capl package. These steps include preparing, formatting, and importing CAPL-2 raw data. We then use demo data to show that computing the CAPL-2 scores and interpretations is as simple as executing one line of code. This one line of code uses the main function in the capl package (get_capl()) to compute 40 variables within a matter of seconds. Next, we showcase the helper functions that are called within the main function to compute individual variables and scores for each test element within the four domains as well as an overall physical literacy score. Finally, we show how to visualize CAPL-2 results using the ggplot2 R package."

Using population register data, we studied all singleton live births in Sweden from 1992â2012 (n = 1,317,265). Multinomial logistic regression was performed to compare gestational age outcomes classified into very (&lt;32 weeks) and late preterm (32â36 weeks), term and post-term derived from the last menstrual period (LMP) and ultrasound estimates in foreign- and Swedish-born women. Compared to Swedish-born women, foreign-born women had similar odds of very preterm birth (OR: 0.98 [95% CI: 0.98, 1.01]) and lower odds of moderately preterm birth (OR: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.92, 0.98]) based on ultrasound, while higher risks based on LMP (respectively, OR: 1.10 [95% CI: 1.07, 1.14] and 1.09 [95% CI: 1.06, 1.13]). Conclusions on disparities in gestational age-related outcomes by motherâs country of origin depend on the method used to estimate gestational age. Except for very preterm, foreign-born women had a health advantage when gestational age is based on ultrasound, but a health disadvantage when based on LMP. Studies assessing disparities in very preterm birth by migration status are not affected by the estimation method but caution should be taken when interpreting disparities in moderately preterm and preterm birth rates."

Throughout the observation period, there was a significant decrease in the diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) [%] (-6.5504 Â± 13,39, p = 0.001) and forced expiratory volume in one second predicted (FEV1) [%] (-6.07 Â± 12.09, p = 0.001). Patients with greater impairment of forced vital capacity (FVC) did have significantly higher serum levels of VEGF (p = 0.03) and PDGF-AB (p&lt;0.001). The K-BILD questionnaire did not change significantly during follow-up. However, patients with worsening K-BILD scores did have significantly higher serum-levels of PDGF-AB (2.67 pg/ml Â± 0.93 vs. 1.88 pg/ml Â± 0.60, p = 0.004) at baseline, compared to those with unchanged or increasing K-BILD scores. Conclusions Among patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, baseline serum levels of VEGF and PDGF-AB were associated with pulmonary function impairment. Furthermore, PDGF-AB was associated with worsening K-BILD scores. No such association was observed for FGF-2 and TGF-Ã1. VEGF and PDGF-AB may be possible prognostic and therapeutic targets in sarcoidosis as a fibrosing ILD beyond IPF."

In Eastern and Southern Africa, of the people living with HIV infection, more adult women than men were on treatment highlighting the disparities in HIV services. Delayed initiation of antiretroviral treatment creates a missed opportunity to prevent transmission of HIV while increasing HIV and AIDS-associated morbidity and mortality. The main objective of this study was to assess the strategies that men prefer for Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) initiation in Blantyre, Malawi. Methods This was a qualitative study conducted in 7 Health facilities in Blantyre from January to July 2017. We selected participants following purposive sampling. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with men of different HIV statuses, 17 interviews with health care workers (HCWs), and 14 focus group discussions (FGDs) among men of varying HIV statuses. We digitally recorded all the data, transcribed verbatim, managed using NVivo, and analysed it thematically. Results Restructuring the delivery of antiretroviral (ARVs) treatment and conduct of ART clinics is key to optimizing early initiation of treatment among heterosexual men in Blantyre. The areas requiring restructuring included: Clinic days by offering ARVs daily; Clinic hours to accommodate schedules of men; Clinic layout and flow that preserves privacy and establishment of male-specific clinics; ARV dispensing procedures where clients receive more pills to last them longer than 3 months. Additionally there is need to improve the packaging of ARVs, invent ARVs with less dosing frequency, and dispense ARVs from the main pharmacy. It was further suggested that the test-and-treat strategy be implemented with fidelity and revising the content in counseling sessions with an emphasis on the benefits of ARVs. Conclusion The success in ART initiation among men will require a restructuring of the current ART services to make them accessible and available for men to initiate treatment. The inclusion of people-centered approaches will ensure that individual preferences are incorporated into the initiation of ARVs. The type, frequency, distribution, and packaging of ARVs should be aligned with other medicines readily available within a health facility to minimize stigma."
https://openalex.org/W3132363600,"Purpose To compare the image quality of acquired diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and computed DWI and evaluate the lesion detectability and likelihood of malignancy in these datasets. Materials and methods This prospective study was approved by our institutional review board. A total of 29 women (mean age, 43.5 years) underwent DWI between August 2018 and April 2019 for 32 breast cancers and 16 benign breast lesions. Three radiologists independently reviewed the acquired DWI with b-values of 1000 and 2000 s/mm 2 (A-b1000 and A-b2000) and the computed DWI with a b-value of 2000 s/mm 2 (C-b2000). Image quality was scored and compared between the three DWI datasets. Lesion detectability was recorded, and the lesionâs likelihood for malignancy was scored using a five-point scale. Results The A-b1000 images were superior to the A-b2000 and C-b2000 images in chest distinction, fat suppression, and overall image quality. The A-b2000 and C-b2000 images showed comparable scores for all image quality parameters. C-b2000 showed the highest values for lesion detection among all readers, although there was no statistical difference in sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy between the DWI datasets. The malignancy scores of the DWI images were not significantly different among the three readers. Conclusions A-b1000 DWI is suitable for breast lesion evaluations, considering its better image quality and comparable diagnostic values compared to that of A-b2000 and C-b2000 images. The additional use of computed high b-value DWI may have the potential to increase the detectability of breast masses."
https://openalex.org/W3129864091,"Objectives This paper reports a mixed methods evaluation of a new pathway to improve clinical outcomes for older people with fractures treated at a hospital Trust in the West Midlands, UK. The paper focuses specifically on the context surrounding the translation of the new pathway into practice and the way that external and internal factors influenced its adaptation and implementation. Methods Quantitative analysis used a controlled Interrupted Time Series (ITS) to estimate the effect of the new pathway on patient complication rate, median length of hospital stay and 30-day mortality by comparing the pre- and post-intervention periods. ITS data were extracted from the UK Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) database and a patient-level control group identified using propensity score matching. Parallel qualitative analysis aimed to examine the context surrounding the new pathway and how external and internal factors might influence its adaption and implementation into clinical practice. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews (n = 16) undertaken with staff and clinical stakeholders within the Trust and were analysed using the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, Motivation) model of behaviour. Results No statistically significant effects were found for any of the patient outcomes studied in the controlled ITS analysis. Qualitative data suggest that the lack of effectiveness of the new initiative can be explained with reference to the capability, opportunity and motivation of internal Trust stakeholders to engage with the pathway, which created a non-receptive environment within the Trust. Conclusions Successfully implementing new care pathways in environments that may be non-receptive to change requires efforts to be put into winning âhearts and mindsâ within the organisation to ensure engagement from key stakeholders during intervention development. Evidence must be provided internally of the way that a given intervention will alleviate the problematic issues being experienced within the organisation, and external dissemination of results should be avoided until there is evidence of a positive effect within the organisation where the new care pathway is first implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3133146937,"Dams and reservoirs alter natural water flow regimes with adverse effects on natural ecosystems. Quantifying and reducing these effects are important as global demands for energy and water, and the number of dams and reservoir, increase. However, costs and logistic constraints typically preclude experimental assessment of reservoir effects on the environment. We developed a stochastic individual-based model (IBM), parameterized using empirical data, to estimate the annual productivity of yellow warblers that breed in riparian habitat within the footprint of the Arrow Lakes Reservoir in British Columbia, Canada. The IBM incorporated information on breeding phenology, nest site selection, brood parasitism, daily nest survival, re-nesting probabilities and post-fledging survival. We used the IBM to estimate the effect of four different water management scenarios on annual productivity. We found that the IBM accurately estimated average nest success (0.39 Â± 0.10 SD), the proportion of females that produced at least one fledgling during a breeding season (0.56 Â± 0.11), and annual fledging success (2.06 Â± 0.43) under current conditions. The IBM estimated that reservoir operations currently reduce the annual productivity of this population by 37%, from an average of 1.62 to 1.06 independent young/female. Delaying when reservoir water levels reach 435m asl (the minimum elevation occupied by yellow warblers) by approximately 2 weeks was predicted to increase annual productivity to 1.44 independent young/female. The standardized effect on annual productivity of reducing the maximum elevation of the reservoir so that yellow warbler habitat is not inundated (Cohenâs d = 1.52) or delaying when water is stored (Cohenâs d = 0.83) was primarily driven by inundation effects on post-fledging survival. Reservoir operation effects on breeding birds will be species specific, but this IBM can easily be modified to allow the environmental impacts on the entire breeding bird community to be incorporated into water management decisions."
